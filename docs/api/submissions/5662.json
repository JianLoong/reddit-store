You obviously are very aware of the wild amount of wealth you married into and how much it sets you apart. You say in a comment you \u2018realize how bad it is going to sound\u201d that your kids don\u2019t need a college fund. You know how much you spend on your kids each year for Christmas and since you make a point of mentioning your donations I am sure you know how much that amount of money would mean to a an average or low-income family. You knew what you were doing when you bought $4,000 worth of gifts for that girl, you just really wanted to do it. So you did. \n\nI grew up as an average family around a lot of incredibly wealthy families. The \u201cclueless rich\u201d bit gets pretty tiresome. You know perfectly well what you have, you know that it probably makes a lot of people uncomfortable when you spend lavishly around them, so stop pretending you don\u2019t. If you want to treat people to big gifts then ask them or their parents if they\u2019re comfortable with that - some will be and some won\u2019t. Be respectful of that.", "YTA you should definitely check with a parent before you spend that type of money in their child. They might not want their child to own or be responsible for something that expensive. I might have a different opinion if you were talking about a couple of hundred dollars but 4K is a lot of money to most people", "YTA\n\nThese kids are going to turn out fucked.", "Yes, you\u2019re the asshole.", "YTA for not checking with the mom ahead of time. \n\nOne because it can set a precedence for future holidays and birthdays...putting her parents in an impossible situation where they can't possibly meet her expectations, and two because they may not think their child is responsible enough to care for something so expensive. These are both important issues. \n\nImagine if you have given her these gifts before her own parents had given her their gifts. Now you have a child in letdown mode because you just set the stage for getting fabulous gifts and now she has to feign excitement when the gifts she gets afterwards are less than spectacular. \n\nNow imagine if something happens to the necklace or bag? Do you know how mortified and guilt ridden bother cousin and her mother would be? 14 year Olds who didn't grow up with expensive things aren't exactly known for being the most responsible.  I know I would be concerned if someone had gifted one of my daughters a $3000 necklace and $1000 bag when they were 14. Having to follow them around to make sure that the necklace was being returned to its case after wearing, having to take it in to be inspected all the time to maintain the warranty, and making sure they weren't using that $1000 bag to carry their lunch or putting it on the floor when they went places. \n\nYou're really out of touch with reality if you don't think anything of dropping thousands of dollars on a child without talking to their parents.", "This one was a bit tough for me as I have been the recipient in situations like this but my parents were fine with it, even when it was a surprise. \n\nFor example, my dad was a teacher and did a lot of tutoring for rich families in our town on the side. Some of those families became good friends of ours as well so these were family friends giving us gifts. We were not poverty-level poor but we lived in the worst house in a nice town with an excellent school district, and the mortgage on that shitty house was a stretch for my parents. We always struggled with money (and my brother and I certainly felt poor compared to our classmates) but our parents wanted us to be in this school district. \n\nI remember one of those families (turned into a good family friend) was really grateful for my dad's tutoring. And even though he was paid a very good rate to tutor their kid, they were super grateful that their kid did well on his SATs. They wanted to give my dad a bonus. My dad said it was unnecessary but because they kept insisting, he said that if they really wanted to, they could get me a little gift because I helped with the kid's SAT tutoring. I was actually a couple years younger but had nearly aced my SATs as a freshman (took them as practice for my PSATs bc I wanted to do well on those for scholarship purposes). To our surprise, they gifted me a Fendi bag. It was apparently an entry level bag so to them, it was \"small\" but of course we were totally surprised. \n\nMy parents could not afford to spend hundreds, much less over a thousand dollars on a gift for me. But they did recognize that our expectations were just different. A small gift to us was not the same as a small gift to them. That being said, they were mainly just happy for me. And I never thought less of them for not being able to afford nicer gifts. I actually mainly remember being concerned with money issues in high school because I didn't want them to overextend themselves. I worked an after school job to go to some nerdy summer camps and pay for tickets/expenses for school dances and such. I don't want to imply I was a great kid all the time or that they were always awesome parents. I fought a LOT with my dad growing up (he was controlling), but money was never an issue outside of my dad shaming me on \"overspending\" on his gifts once I had a full-time job after college (he grew up super poor during a civil war and had a lot of issues around financial insecurity). \n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying that I get it. You didn't think twice because your scale for normal is very different than your cousin's daughter's mother's expectations. I think it would have been nice to give her a heads up or talk to her first but ultimately it is a gift. And you can do what you want with your money. She can choose to see it as a nice surprise or take it as an insult, and I do think that's on her. It would have been nice to give a heads up but I don't think it's necessary so I'm leaning toward NTA with the potential for a very soft E S H for not checking in with her first. \n\nEdit: put the wrong soft judgment - changed to E S H but doesn't change my actual judgment.", "YTA and showing off because you married money.", "ESH. You bought a 14 year old $4k worth of gifts that you \u2018thought she might like\u2019? Her mom overreacted, for sure, but you need to think about the amount you\u2019re spending on people vs. their actual needs.", "Omg ESH. Spending $15k per child? Donating and being grateful is nice but your children are going to grow up to be materialistic, entitled monsters. You can see how it\u2019s already causing problems in the family. \n\nWhy not put some of that money into a college fund or trust FBO the kids? I\u2019m guessing that will have a more meaningful impact than a YSL bag that will be yesterday\u2019s news in a few weeks.", "NTA. \n\nI think you did a nice thing that was just a little extravagant and you unintentionally overshadowed her mother. \n\nI think her mother overreacted. It\u2019s not like you bought her a car or a puppy or something she needs to be responsible for.", "Esh maybe the mom overracted but spending 4k on a 14 year old is insane.", "Absolutely YTA.", "NTA. I don't know why you're getting shit on here. You were doing something nice for her.", "NTA\n\nThis boils down to your circumstances allowing for lavish gifts, even for early-teen children and how much that differs from most families. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ass for your generosity. I would say it can come across as\u2026out of touch? When so many families struggle to provide one gift, let alone $4k worth, it will naturally make people think that you\u2019ve lost the perspective on how $4k can change a person\u2019s life. \n\nI personally would have been ecstatic to have those gifts, but perhaps you could revisit how you\u2019re buying gifts. Set general limits on what you\u2019ll spend and make sure it\u2019s more reasonable if you don\u2019t \u201cclear\u201d a purchase with the parent. \n\nPut yourself in the parent\u2019s shoes. If you couldn\u2019t afford to spend that much, you\u2019d feel gut punched seeing your child light up and forget about everything you purchased for them because you just don\u2019t have the funds to buy lavishly. \n\nEven if finances aren\u2019t an issue, the parents could have issues with their child receiving an expensive gift like this and your gift crosses the line they want in place. \n\nYou could also just ask the parents if they have any sort of college fund or account set aside for their child that they contribute to.

It can also make gifts that the parents worked hard for look like \u201cless than\u201d because they don\u2019t have as much money. Maybe not the asshole so much as just really thoughtless of the situation in general.

Cousins with matching gifts is a sweet idea.  It's not like you are constantly throwing money and gifts to them. This is once maybe twice a year if you buy for birthdays.  I see no harm in the Cousin getting a nice gift. It shows they are loved and thought of.", "YTA\n\nAbsolutely no one should be spending $15k on ANYONE  for Christmas, let alone a 14 year old. Jesus.

No one should have that kind of money, honestly.", "I thought it was going to be something useful, like a new ipad with the works, a new computer or something.

If you gave one $1500 in presents and the other $200, one would feel less than. \n\nIf the mom doesn't want you doing this in the future, you or her mom will need to explain why so she doesn't feel rejected.", "I would say NTA honestly. Many people here are patronizing this girl by assuming she has no concept of wealth and gifting. You said that it\u2019s common knowledge that your family is extremely wealthy, so At 14, I think she can handle accepting an expensive gift without expecting the same from her parents or thinking that her family has the same amount of disposable income as your family does. \n\nMoreover, the people accusing you of making your kids materialistic are ridiculous for the same reason of making assumptions. Sure, rich kids can become spoiled and out of touch, but it is not automatically so, especially if you take the time to emphasize the very unique financial situation your family has. \n\nFinally, I truly think that the mother\u2019s anger comes from her perception that you \u201cupstaged\u201d the gifts she bought for her daughter, even if those gifts would make her daughter very happy. I think that placing restraints on the gifts her daughter receives based on her need to not be upstaged (going off of what you wrote) is plainly selfish. Yes, it can be seen as \u201cout of touch\u201d, but if the mother thinks that it is, that\u2019s a conversation she needs to have with her daughter. Such a conversation doesn\u2019t necessitate her getting mad at you, or her wanting her daughter to not receive those gifts.\n\nEdit: I also want to add that growing up poor can make you materialistic too. My dad was impoverished and although I didn\u2019t expect much (or anything) from him at Christmas, I still felt jealously when I saw kids that had heaps of expensive presents under the tree. Eventually, When I got my first job I would stupidly spend whole pay checks on stuff I didn\u2019t need as a way to fill that void I guess. Took me a long time to adjust to consistent, stable income out of poverty after his death and realize that I didn\u2019t need to be materialistic, I didn\u2019t have to anxiously waste all of my money buying small luxuries for myself.", "NTA but I do think you\u2019ve learned a bit of a lesson for the future. You did a very nice thing (buy a thoughtful and expensive gift for someone you care about) with extremely good intentions, so absolutely NTA.\n\nStill, I can see how the kid\u2019s mom would be embarrassed that she spent less on her daughter (especially when I\u2019m assuming it was a lot less, possibly several thousands less) than someone she doesn\u2019t really know. It can feel like you\u2019re not doing enough for your kid/being shown up. It\u2019s good to keep that in mind when buying expensive gifts, and discuss that with giftees/parents of giftees.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t know the mom well and thought you were doing the right thing, so that\u2019s an excusable mistake. The kid\u2019s mom should have been excited for her kid, and talked to you privately to explain her embarrassment and work it out politely so that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Instead, she upset *her own damn child, on CHRISTMAS.* Gross.", "NTA. Reading this I immediately thought you weren't TA and reading your replies to others just made me believe that more.

My cousins always had more presents at Christmas and when I was little my cousin said that Santa got them more because they were better.\n\nAs a teen I lived with another aunt and uncle after my mother lost custody (drug use/abuse) and I was never take on family vacations with my guardians when they went to Hawaii. When my aunt was booking a trip to NYC with another wealthy aunt and cousins I talked about how I\u2019d love to go and my aunt decided that we wouldn\u2019t be joining the other trip likely to avoid drama because I probably wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nI love my guardians and aunts and uncles and cousins and feel very fortunate that I was taken in by family and supported. My mother had four siblings and I\u2019ve been a guest living in all of their house holds at sometime during my childhood. But I always knew I wasn\u2019t their kid, none of my aunts and uncles would adopt me or treat me just that same as their children.\n\nI was on my own at 18, I got scholarships and worked hard and it\u2019s absolutely fine I wasn\u2019t gifted designer bags or allowed to learn to drive and gifted a car like my cousins.

I\u2019m forever grateful and treasured that suit! I wore it through college and law school and when I started practicing law. I treasured it, because it was the nicest thing in owned and such a generous gift!\n\nYour niece-ish (I call my second cousins niece and nephews since I think of my cousins like siblings) will treasure those gifts!

But you were also completely out of touch. There are a myriad of consequences giving a teen a massively expensive gift could have.\n\nWill it spark jealousy among her other family members? Does it raise insurance premiums? Does it build barriers between the teen and their caregiver? Does it make them vulnerable in their neighborhood or make their home a target for theives? Does it fly in the face of their family's morals or parenting style? \n\nI don't think you are big AH, I think it was unintentional.

I grew up poor with my mom only being able to afford simple things for Christmas, like maybe a sweater, a pair of shoes, etc. My aunts/uncles were more middle class and would definitely spend more on a gift for me than my parent\u2019s did. My mom never got upset. She was grateful for anything they gifted me, because above all, she wanted me to be happy. Did she feel a little insecure about it? Yes, but she prioritized my happiness. IMO, your cousin\u2019s daughter\u2019s mother is feeling ashamed she cannot afford a gift that expensive and is taking out her internalized insecurities on you. I would reach out and apologize to make peace and show you didn\u2019t have any malicious intentions.", "I\u2019m going to be controversial and go with NAH.  \n\nI can totally believe OP wasn\u2019t being malicious at  all and genuinely wanted to do something nice.

Which by the way is a great thing to do, but there is perhaps too much being made of this in the comments.  \n\nI also get the cousin\u2019s reaction.  I feel a little like that when my ex treats my daughter to loads of things and experiences I can\u2019t really afford - I am really happy for her and I would never blow up at him for giving her so much, but I do get a painful pang that I can\u2019t give her everything I would like to.  But I know that\u2019s a me problem, not a him problem, and the key thing is that he and I do communicate on these things (ironically, as lack of communication broke down our marriage).  \n\nI think how the OP talks to the cousin will be crucial.  She needs to acknowledge that it would have been wiser for her to communicate with her before buying the gifts. Perhaps they could have come up with an awesome gift idea together and mum could have had the credit of being part of the process and OP helped with the practicalities of sourcing it.

Yes, but not brand or anything like that, also Christmas doesn't have a specific gift you need to give, sometimes it would be what you think they want too.

Let me bounce some ideas back at you. \n\nAt the end of the day, if I understand correctly, the gifts to the 14 year old are 1-purse, 1-jewelry item. It was sweet of you to want to show this young woman that to you she matters and deserves special things too. Good job, momma. \n\nPragmaticly, this isn\u2019t about the items it\u2019s about the socioeconomic dynamic with this mom, whom if I understand correctly is not in the same position the rest of the family is. She\u2019s a single mom? \n\nAs a single mom, this is so hard. I\u2019m trying to give my children as much opportunity and privilege as possible. I lost my business due to debilitating health issues and a complicated domestic abuse situation. Basically, I was too physically ill to cope with a marriage to someone that battered me and my children in almost every way increasingly. \n\nOur stability often depends on miracles and near misses. It is 4am Christmas night and after my entire family did our best to pull of a normal and joyful Christmas I\u2019m loosing sleep scared about my landlord constantly intimidating me and my children. \n\nSo. To have avoided this situation with the mom it may have required you to add another layer of consideration. As much as you wanted this child to feel as valuable as your child\u2026maybe you got caught up in the material world unintentionally. You seem to want to understand this mom, which is highly commendable. Having someone like you in my childrens lives would change their lives and it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re reaching out to figure this situation out. \n\nI bet mom needs more support and in her emotions transferred that frustration into this topic. You said you have $15,000 to charities of your childrens choices? Here\u2019s an idea. What if you spend this year soothing things with the mom, fostering bonding between the child and yours, humbling yourself..and next year that donation could be given to this young woman\u2019s family? I know it\u2019s often a hard thing to navigate, but I can tell you it might be a huge life changing blessing for this young woman. I\u2019m raising 6 kids on just over $15000 a year, when I used to make that much in one weekend. Maybe her mom kinda panicked feeling like she can\u2019t have her daughter walking around in their world with items that valuable when she has bills and an education to focus on. Did you know that $2.500 is usually the difference between a woman staying in an abusive situation or ended up homeless? $15k could truly change their lives. \n\nOne thing I know, those that have more money are often better at making decisions\u2026tho a fraction can be horrible people. You\u2019ve done a lot of good for people both in your life and strangers. Don\u2019t let the left hand know what the right hand is doing tho. You can\u2019t humble yourself too much within a place of compassion and self respect. Reach out to her and maybe host a get together to apologize. After you\u2019ve built up a relationship with mom see how she needs help and do it anonymously. I bet 15k would pay her rent for a year! \n\nEvery year I think about the anonymous gift of $500 that was left on my car in my driveway the week my daughter was born Christmas 2015.  That person doesn\u2019t know how much that meant to us on levels. My partner had tried to choke me to death a few months before and was in law enforcement so I couldn\u2019t say anything.

Instead, you got them something they can enjoy together. It\u2019s created some bad feelings with her mom, but the point is, there were going to be bad feelings *either way*. This young woman was either going to feel left out seeing her cousin enjoy things she could never have herself or feel guilty for triggering her mom\u2019s insecurities about money. I\u2019d say the type of pain your daughter\u2019s cousin is experiencing right now is preferable to the alternative.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the stuff as stuff, it\u2019s about sharing something rare and valuable with someone close to you. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll treasure these things because they\u2019re shared with someone she loves. If you want to cheer her back up, maybe you could do manicures at home (going to a professional salon might be a bit insensitive given the fact that the mom\u2019s problem is with money). You could have a bit of a photo shoot so they can show off their matching rings, which might help bring back some of the joy of matching with her cousin.\n\nI would still apologize to her mother and try to get on good terms with her. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll want to continue giving your daughter\u2019s cousin nice gifts in the future, so having her mom on the same page will prevent this emotional rollercoaster from repeating itself. If you really have that much money, you might be able to recruit her mom into the gifting process by allowing some things to be \u201cfrom\u201d the parents\u2014the kid isn\u2019t stupid, she\u2019ll know who\u2019s actually buying this stuff, but it might help make everyone feel a bit more secure in the situation. Her mom doesn\u2019t want to feel like a failure every time her daughter gets something nice.\n\nIn any case, I think this is one of those situations where you make nice for the long-term well-being of the kids. This young woman is the one who\u2019s going to be caught in the crossfire in a fight between adults, which is something worth avoiding regardless of who\u2019s wrong or right.\n\nMy one suggestion is that you might want to consider the types of gifts you\u2019ll be giving moving forward. A ring and a nice purse can mean a lot to a young adult, but they\u2019re not really \u201cuseful\u201d in regards to what she\u2019s going to need in the coming years. Things like driving school/professional instruction (*definitely* with parental approval), current tech she can use for school and leisure, or experiences the kids can share like cooking or music lessons are likely to provide more enduring value. That said, everyone should be able to enjoy luxury for its own sake, so I can\u2019t fault the kids for wanting that. It\u2019s a shame our economic and political system makes that impossible for most people, but that isn\u2019t this young woman\u2019s cross to bear. The mom is a victim of capitalism telling her that her worth comes from the material possessions she can provide to her children. Of course she feels threatened. I\u2019m sure she wants the best for her daughter though, so you may very well be able to get on the same side here if you proceed gently.", "NTA People who are angry/jealous will always find reasons to fuel their bitterness.
