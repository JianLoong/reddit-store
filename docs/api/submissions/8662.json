Then she got pregnant and we went all out even the friend that baby shower she skipped out on. I think it was because she discussed her feelings and she didn\u2019t want to be around the babies with that resentment. She told us that she didn\u2019t want to bring that type of energy around and needed space. Maybe you guys should have a sit down.", "NTA whilst I understand her behaviour, once she got pregnant she should have been happy enough with that, felt sad for how she was with you and asked other people like you did to help her. And then in the meantime she needed to just re-integrate herself in your life without asking demands of you - but just being happy for you and getting to know your baby so that hopefully you could both move on once her baby was here.\n\nBut instead her behaviour after she found out she was pregnant is disgraceful. But honestly the whats with the whole social media thing as the first comment is also disgusting. You can be sad but still wish happiness for someone you love. All she had to say is congratulations and no more.\n\nTake time away from her,  strengthen other relationships, find new friend though mother and baby groups. Do not do her shower. And tell her you have a real life child that needs your attention now - you dont have time - you are the one in need of help and support.", "NTA what she asked of you was, essentially, to behave as though you were not pregnant. Which is incredible to ask of someone.\n\nWhile I can appreciate that having fertility difficulties is emotionally hard on her, as an adult it is her responsibility to cope with. An appropriate approach would have been for her to tell you that \"I am struggling emotionally and psychologically, and while I do want to be supportive and am happy for you. I simply do not have the capacity to take part in your journey through this pregnancy in a way which is healthy for either of us. I'm making the conscious decision to limit our time together for right now, so that I can work through my problems without putting the weight of them on you.\"\n\nIt was her responsibility to deal with. Instead, she made it your problem. That's really rather awful.\n\nThe bottom line is that friendships change. People change. Circumstances change. Everything changes. It doesn't matter if you've grown up with someone and been close to them most of your life, you will both change and your relationship will as well. It's an ongoing reality of being human, that we have to reevaluate our relationships and adjust them according to where we (and our counterparts) are at in life.\n\nWhether or not you can salvage the relationship which once existed isn't the question.

But I admit that I don't get this kind of thing at all.\n\nIt seems like the feelings of the infertile get indulged way more than the feelings of other folks who have a dream denied.  You don't hear perpetually unhappily single people demanding that their friends never talk about their relationships or weddings.  People who are stuck in dead end jobs don't typically demand that everyone stay silent about their jobs and promotions.  I get that it is very painful to see other people with their babies when you are unable to have your own.  But policing what people post on their social media?  That is crazy.  I think people need to be told explicitly that is never OK. I gotta think that the only reason your friend thinks this is acceptable is because someone else has indulged her. Good on you for telling to cram it.", "NTA\n\nFertility issues don't give you a free ride to be an arsehole.\n\nMy best friend got pregnant while I was mid fertility issues (and I still am).

As someone who struggled with fertility issues, it is totally possible to be simultaneously 100% happy for and 100% jealous of pregnant friends. Your fertility status doesn't define you, but your actions do. You acted sensitively, she didn't and there is no need to go out of your way to pander to her. You are also entitled to feel hurt. Plus, I can't imagine you haev that much free time to organize a baby shower etc with a 6 month old. You can tell her you are happy for her and can be there for her, but set boundaries and tell her no when you don't want to do something.

For us it was 1 year of constant trying, medical procedures and pain.\n\nI was in the thick of it when my friend got pregnant. She told me and really understood if I needed space and distance.

What stands out to me in this is that your \u2018friend\u2019 found it easy to ignore the existence of your precious little one.

Friendships should be reciprocal.", "NTA - I've got a big old hurdle to my chances of ever getting pregnant, and pregnancy announcements feel like a bit of a punch in the gut these days.

This person isn\u2019t a friend. I had something similar happen. When my partner and I met. She was there for me during my divorce but once I had moved on and was happy she totally bailed.

Tell her you're busy with your kid and your own family.", "NTA. You are legitimately really busy right now. Congrats on the little one.", "NTA.

Best case scenario is that the two of you can get closer again and get over it. NTA,  I wish you good luck.", "Agreed. I struggled with fertility issues and 2 horrific losses, so I am very sympathetic to her situation. It's so difficult. But to have her basically insist you not share anything about your pregnancy with her, to never meet your daughter, and then finally when it happens for her to insist you do everything she refused to do? That doesn't seem right. \n\nYou're NTA. I know she has struggled and it's so painful. But she can't expect this out of you after the way she treated you.", "Totally agree. \n\nWOOHOO! I'm your One thousandth like! haha", "It\u2019s a phrase for the first three months after the baby is born when a baby is still very much a potato and your body is still recovering so you really aren\u2019t doing much. Right around four months old something switches and you start seeing a personality in the baby and they start doing things like rolling over, etc.", "Agreed. I haven\u2019t had this issue in the infertility context, but I\u2019ve had it in other ways. When someone isn\u2019t there for you, but then expects you to be there for them?

OP's \"friend\" appears to think the whole world revolves around her.\n\nNTA.", "I was scrolling and looking to see if this would be said, and I'm glad you said it. NTA. People like this tend to cry that they need their village, but don't realize that part of the bargain of being in a village means that you have to show up for others too. You're allowed your boundaries, but to expect your best friend to hide her pregnancy from you is really strange. Top that off with the back-handed comment about social media, and that's someone that can just fade into the background while OP is off making new mom friends.

It\u2019s just about HOW they go about it. However, they have options for social media. They can unfollow you until they feel ready.
