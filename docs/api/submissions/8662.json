That is no friend regardless of their issues.", "No, you're NTA for not wanting to commit to things with such a wishy washy friend, at all\n\nAlso, INFO: 4th Trimester?", "NTA. I got a little peeved just reading this. You were way nicer than I would have been.", "NTA\n\nI mostly agree with a lot of people saying NAH but it tips over for me with the \u201cwhat\u2019s with sll the social media?\u201d Comment from the friend. \n\nHer feelings towards a friend having the dream she (thought) she could not have arr valid but she does not get to police that OP wanted to share her happiness with the rest of her social circles. That\u2019s on her own head to mute OP\u2019s profile if she doesnt want to see pictures. \n\nAlso, it does not sound like the friend wants to share OP\u2019s happiness now that she is pregnant, she only wants to have everyone focus on her and her baby. If you only visit a friend to make an announcement that puts focus for the next full year on yourself, then you did not visit your friend, you were look for a chance to steal the spotlight.", "NTA she didn\u2019t want you to talk about your child bc she was dealing with her own problem and made it about herself, now she wants you around just bc she\u2019s having a kid.", "NTA. One of my mothers closest friends has problems having kids but she has always been there to support my mom from pregnancy to now when I'm an adult. She calls me her son and has always been there. That's true friendship", "NTA 100%. true friends dont supress other friends emotions to spare their own.\nYour aquaintance is self centered and narcissistic", "NTA, if she was a true friend she would have been there for you and shared your happiness. Now she expects you to be there when its her turn. Focus on your baby and celebrate the life you have. Doubt if she's the friend whose worth going the extra mile for. Enjoy the time with your daughter as they grow up very fast and be selective in wasting time for your friend.

I don't have time to give you at the moment. I'm just too busy with my little one. I can't be there for you the way you need because *my* life is my priority at the moment.

I went through this massive upheaval without you and I'm still trying to play catch up. I'm not being petty, and I'm not holding what you needed against you. This is what *I* need right now. I was understanding when you needed me to be, even when you were unreasonable enough to suggest that I shouldn't celebrate my baby's arrival online. Now I'm asking you to show the same understanding. I'm happy to listen to you talk, but I don't have the time to support you the way you want me to.\"", "NTA but if she is your best friend the way my best friend is mine, then I am sure you don\u2019t just want to cut her loose. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say she\u2019s not a true friend or whatever. Fertility issues can be (and usually are) deeply traumatising for women. Sometimes, it\u2019s just trying to survive because it\u2019s hella depressing and all-consuming. Also, if she was trying for a while, she may well have been on hormones / meds at the time that mess with emotional regulation in awful ways. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t give her free reign to hurt people though and she could\u2019ve distanced herself without being an AH about it. \n\nA conversation would go a long way here OP. She owes you an apology. Unreservedly. And if you want an explanation, she should provide one too. Tell her how to make amends and what your boundaries are, if that\u2019ll help. \n\nOnly cut her loose if she still doesn\u2019t hear where you are coming from.", "NAH", "NAH, honestly. She was going through her own things, and you understood even though you were hurt by her actions.\n\nNow, you're going through your own things--you have a baby to care for, and you are grieving that part of the friendship. That's real, and a good reason not to do things like throw a baby shower or be overly involved in her pregnancy!\n\nYour feelings matter too.\n\nYou can tell her that you're still hurting and need some space. Be there for her ONLY as much as you want to be and can be without pain. (Just as she was for you.)", "NAH. Your feelings are valid, but so were hers. She was in a place where she couldn\u2019t be supportive and knew that, so took some space. Now her situation has changed, and she might be going a bit overboard trying to make up for the lost time, without realizing how it\u2019s making you feel. You\u2019ve told her how you feel, so now the question is can you/do you want to let it go so you can fix the friendship?", "NAH-  Times of major struggles are often periods in people's lives where they can't balance their friendships on top of that, especially when a friend is hitting all of their points of major sources of pain. She needed to do what she needed to do to get through everything during that time.\n\nBut when people are going through their struggles and doing what they need to do to manage, that isn't consequence free. There are effects from neglecting friendships. Everything you're feeling is more than valid too. \n\nShe wanted to pause and resume the friendship like nothing happened, and life just doesn't work that way.", "NAH. She was in a lot of emotional pain while you were going through your pregnancy. It's okay to be forgiving and be there for her with hers.

I understand her being sad for her own fertility issues, but the way she treated you is bullshit. She was jealous. And, to say you can't share pics of your own newborn on social media because it's upsetting to her? No. NTA. Don't do anything for her that you don't want to do.", "Maybe it\u2019s lost in translation but in my country it\u2019s what they call the first three months after pregnancy when your body is still recovering, hormones are still raging and you\u2019re adjusting to life with a baby.", "Yeah I was like did they shove it back in to cook a little longer", "It's another name for the first 3 postpartum months since it's the big healing and adjustment period after birth.", "And what I forgot to mention was that at that point I only made two posts. One of her birth and one that she was already two weeks old and time was flying. After that I had stopped posting until an aunt of me wrote that I should send her some pictures in private because everyone is so curious about her and I never post a picture. That\u2019s why it\u2019s still in my mind as one of the biggest things that happened.", "It\u2019s difficult. I loved our friendship pre-pregnancy but after months of not being able to share this big life-changing event it sort of watered down. So I truly need to think this through wetter I\u2019m missing the old friendship and if that\u2019s still salvageable or if I can find myself into this new friendship that we\u2019ve evolved into.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not seeing that she\u2019s engaging with you in good faith about this. She needed more NPC\u2019s in her own baby show and you were available.", "NTA\n\nAlso, she\u2019s not your friend", "NTA but I understand her, I have a friend that was in the same boat, except she told us she couldn\u2019t handle anymore babyshowers in the friend group due to 5 years of trying. Then she got pregnant and we went all out even the friend that baby shower she skipped out on. I think it was because she discussed her feelings and she didn\u2019t want to be around the babies with that resentment. She told us that she didn\u2019t want to bring that type of energy around and needed space. Maybe you guys should have a sit down.", "NTA whilst I understand her behaviour, once she got pregnant she should have been happy enough with that, felt sad for how she was with you and asked other people like you did to help her. And then in the meantime she needed to just re-integrate herself in your life without asking demands of you - but just being happy for you and getting to know your baby so that hopefully you could both move on once her baby was here.\n\nBut instead her behaviour after she found out she was pregnant is disgraceful. But honestly the whats with the whole social media thing as the first comment is also disgusting. You can be sad but still wish happiness for someone you love. All she had to say is congratulations and no more.\n\nTake time away from her,  strengthen other relationships, find new friend though mother and baby groups. Do not do her shower. And tell her you have a real life child that needs your attention now - you dont have time - you are the one in need of help and support.", "NTA what she asked of you was, essentially, to behave as though you were not pregnant. Which is incredible to ask of someone.\n\nWhile I can appreciate that having fertility difficulties is emotionally hard on her, as an adult it is her responsibility to cope with. An appropriate approach would have been for her to tell you that \"I am struggling emotionally and psychologically, and while I do want to be supportive and am happy for you. I simply do not have the capacity to take part in your journey through this pregnancy in a way which is healthy for either of us. I'm making the conscious decision to limit our time together for right now, so that I can work through my problems without putting the weight of them on you.\"\n\nIt was her responsibility to deal with. Instead, she made it your problem. That's really rather awful.\n\nThe bottom line is that friendships change. People change. Circumstances change. Everything changes. It doesn't matter if you've grown up with someone and been close to them most of your life, you will both change and your relationship will as well. It's an ongoing reality of being human, that we have to reevaluate our relationships and adjust them according to where we (and our counterparts) are at in life.\n\nWhether or not you can salvage the relationship which once existed isn't the question. It's whether or not you value the history of the relationship over what it has become.", "NTA. If she were really your best friend she would have found a way to be there for you throughout your pregnancy, despite her pain. She\u2019s not your friend.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate that a best friendship took this turn, but the fact is we can't help feeling what we're feeling.\n\nYou feel unhappy with what she's doing now. I would feel unhappy, too. You can still be friends, but you just aren't going to be her midwife on call 24/7.", "NTA", "YTA for still being friends with her.", "NTA. But remember: you can walk away from this relationship, especially if it is a one-side friendship.", "NTA.  It's one thing if she asked during pregnancy for you to take it easy with details to her but to suggest you tone down your social media and she ignores your baby for months suggests not a true best friend.  It suggests her needs and feelings matter more than yours.  It's good you're honest with her.  If she can take that feedback, apologize sincerely then it's also okay to heal together as friends as well", "NTA. Just because someone is having issues in their own life doesn\u2019t give them the right to make you sensor yours.", "NTA, if she had started with acknowledging the she wasn't there for you, and that she knew she hadn't been there for you, then maybe you could move forward from there, but how you write it, she's not at all interested in how you feel, like a friend would normally be.", "NTA. But this *best friend* of yours is incredibly selfish. You need better friends with mutual respect for each other.", "NTA and you're right to feel the way you feel.", "NTA. I get it's painful to watch someone have a baby when you have fertility issues I have been there and also my best friend was there with me. However at no point did we ever not support each other. The fact she pushed you away and now expects yoy to bend over backwards for her happiness is ridiculous. Tell her congrats but with your current commitments to mothering your baby and due to the distance now in your friendship you will have to pass on organising her events and wish her luck.", "NTA\nOne thing is to be considerate and other is not being able to post anything related to your baby because of her.\nIf she says anything to you, just tell her you had strugles too but acted as an adult and didn't make it anyone else's problem.", "NTA at all!!\n\nWith a best friend like that do you even need enemies?  \nShe sounds insufferable \n\nI am pretty sure she will continue putting her baby before you and yours and it will only get worse.  \nProtect yourself and your baby.", "NTA. I lived this. I had a boss who would get downright angry and resentful toward pregnant women while she was dealing with fertility issues. I myself had issues, including a miscarriage, and I wouldn\u2019t dream of treating anyone this way. OP keep your head up\u2014I hope this friendship is salvageable, but I\u2019m not sure that it is.", "She didn't wanted to be around OP during her whole pregnancy or after, now she wants OP to do things for her because she's pregnant. Sounds like she's not a friend but is willing to use you. \n\nNTA", "It also refers to the fact that as human brains got bigger, fetal heads started getting too big to be born safely, so human babies are born before they're truly \"ready\". That's part of why human babies are so astonishingly helpless compared to any other mammal infant, even other primates. So it's to recognize the fact that it's an important stage for mother and baby, but also to recognize that babies are actually born before they're done cooking, and will need a lot of support around sleep, feeding,  and comforting.", "**NTA. But remember: you can walk away from this relationship, especially if it is a one-side friendship.**", "I had 2 miscarriages before having my daughter & I have PCOS, so I understand as well. I wouldn't dream of treating anyone this way either.\n\nNTA.", "If it bothered her so much, she could have hidden your posts.", "Honestly, that's clever and should be adopted everywhere.", "I\u2019m American in California, it\u2019s used widely with pre and Post natal professionals here!", "More hair and fingernails!!!\n\n*stuff stuff stuff*", "It feels like a way to snuff out your light and joy so that hers shines brighter. I don't doubt she will/is making a huge fuss over her experience on and off line about hers. But made sure you'd feel bad about yours.\n\nThis feels like a pecking order thing and that bothers me.\n\nNTA", "So my bro exploded when I got pregnant around the same time him and his wife did. They did IVF, I tried once with my husband and it worked.\n\nWe didn\u2019t speak for 8 months cuz he had major issues thinking I purposefully did this to him? \n\nNo, I was just living my own life thanks.\n\nAnyways, the relationship has improved. Took a good 2 years to get to a better footing. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t do anything for your friend like throw a shower, I would probably attend it tho. Give it time, wounds are too fresh.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry this is happening. It truly sucks.", "It\u2019s actually a somewhat common phrase.", "American dude here, going to start using it."]}
