You should be able to chill after work. I am the same way, I don\u2019t want to socialize or entertain anyone. It\u2019s admirable what you guys are doing, but house guests get old after awhile.", "Being a maybe reluctant good Samaritan does not automatically mean you have to give up everything. You should absolutely have the choice in how to spend your weekends and with whom you spend them. NTA", "NTA, but you need to sit down with your partner and have a serious conversation about how she is not recognizing that she is ignoring your needs. You already compromised because hosting this couple was important to her, she needs to accept that you are not a social person and you need your alone time. These are people that you are helping out of a terrible situation, not friends staying with you on a holiday. You have already strained your mental health reserves by giving up space in your home that you valued so that they would have somewhere to be, her expecting you to become a different person is a step too far", "NTA You have already gone above and beyond what I would do, especially giving up your home office. You can be civil with housemates without wanting to be friends with them.", "Already sponsoring refugees I mean thats like furthest from an asshole there is. Already sacrificed your living quarters now she wants you to sacrifice all the very little free time you get on the weekend now too? Thats asking too much imo a relationship is 50/50 and you\u2019ve already capitulated plenty.", "NTA", "NTA, I'm on your side completely. I don't really think your wife is an ah either, it's hard to understand introverts if you aren't one. Ideally, she'll try harder with that. She sounds lovely and generous and desirous of helping others. She just doesn't seem to understand that some of us absolutely need alone time, or we're not fit to be with at all", "NTA. She knows about your social battery and your need to be alone. Nothing you've done was cruel or a surprise. \n\nShe is trying to change you, even if she doesn't realize it. You are under no obligation to change.", "NTA, sounds like you gave up a lot to help these refugees, you want/need your space and they \"kicked \" you out of your office, you have given up a lot for them. Now if you have totally ignored them and spent zero time with them I would have a different answer. Your partner knew what kind of person you were/are and she should have your back.", " You should have held your ground and NOT sponsored this unfortunate couple into your home.  But you went along with it.  You now have a couple living in your home who have been through more than most of us can imagine.  Now add to this you want nothing to do with them.  You have provided a roof over their heads... great, wonderful, it was a nice thing to do.  Now your acting childish because your not dealing well with flat mates living with you 24/7... what did you think was going to happen?  You lost your office to give them a bed.. wait, didn't you know how big your space was in the beginning?  These should have been all points considered before sponsoring people from a war torn country into your home.    \n\n\nI am sorry, not sorry but ESH these issues should have been front and center prior to doing this.  The only ones innocent in this is the couple you sponsored.

You are a better person than I am.", "I think in my partners opinion, I'm avoiding them. Which is true I am.\n\nI often joke that I barely tolerate living with her (who I love dearly). I just really like to be a hermit. I can be social when needs be (I.e. Work or when I want to see my friends) but it really exhausts me and most of the time I just don't want to. \n\nSo I guess it's not making them feel welcome. \n\nBut in my opinion, I'm very polite and kind to them (even bought them every cold and flu medicine under the sun while they were ill).

As a fellow human being that prefers solitude above all, I could never imagine having to play \"host\" all the time. Always someone there in another room and never being able to fully relax in your own space.", "NTA/NAH\n\nI'm going to level with you, after reading the post and this comment it feels like they've moved in a lot more than youbwere prepared for. I don't have any insight on how to address that but it really sounds like you've let yourself gradually be put into a position you actively despise.\n\nYou might get some heat because they're refugees, but if it was literally anybody else people would be telling you to put them on notice or in the streets.\n\nHave you addressed these feelings with your SO? Bluntly tell her how you feel and what boundaries you have in place so that you aren't overwhelmed or put into a position where you are upset over this.\n\nAlso consider that maybe your body language has told your guests you don't want them there and they've asked her about it? Kind of reaching but I find it hard to believe they haven't picked up on it.", "Wanting some alone time and space is not acting like a child. OP is going above and beyond for two people who she quite frankly didn't need to help.", "She admitted she's acting in a childish manner, and no there is nothing wrong with wanting alone time.  There is a problem having not considered the ramifications of sponsoring refugees in your home before it happened, instead of becoming resentful after the fact.", "To be honest, I don't want them to leave. If I thought they'd be here for the next few years, I'd feel differently, but this is only temporary. It's just while they get settled, learn English, and find jobs. (We also putting some money each month to help them with a deposit when they're ready to move on.\n\nI actually am friendly to them (I grew up in hospitality, I know how to portray warm and welcoming), and they aren't uncomfortable in our house.\n\nI spoke with my SO earlier today about me not wanting to give up my weekends. I think it will need to be a few more conversations to make my case clear without us just arguing over it. \n\nJust to add, I don't think my partner is an AH in this, or the refugees. I just want space and worry that's how I might be coming across."]}
