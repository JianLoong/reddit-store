Our anniversary is next month. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s brother, Mitch (30M) and his girlfriend, Ashley (29F) have been together for 2 years. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s other brother, Tom (29M), and his fianc\u00e9, Alexis (27F) have been together for over 10 years and they are getting married in Italy this September. \n\nWe live in the US. \n\nAlexis and I used to be fairly close, but we had an argument a while back that we never got over. I was pregnant at the time and ended up having a miscarriage and she told my boyfriend\u2019s family that she thought I was lying about ever being pregnant. She still, to this day, swears I lied about being pregnant and when I asked her why she believes that, she said, \u201cI have a masters degree in psychology. I can tell when people are lying.\u201d So for the past 2 years, we have just always stayed civil at family events but we stay out of each other\u2019s way. \n\nWhen they announced that they were getting married in Italy and it would be a 10 day trip and they expected the whole family to be there, my boyfriend and I were already annoyed because we planned to take a long vacation elsewhere for our anniversary this year. We aren\u2019t able to do both because of money and not having enough PTO at our jobs. But we decided to get over it since it\u2019s their wedding and it\u2019s more important than our anniversary trip. \n\n\nWhen we received the wedding invitation, it only said my boyfriend\u2019s name. But on the RSVP website, it gave him an option for a plus one. So I just assumed that it would be the same for my boyfriend\u2019s brother Mitch\u2019s invitation. But his actually said \u201cMitch and Ashley\u201d on the invitation and the website. \n\nSo my boyfriend asked Tom why my name wasn\u2019t on there but Ashley\u2019s was, and Tom said there must have been some kind of mistake with the company they used for the invites. But he told my boyfriend that I was invited too. \n\nThen a few weeks later, Mitch and Ashley told my boyfriend and I that Alexis told them she purposely did not put my name on the invitation because she doesn\u2019t like me and she thought it would be funny. \n\nI feel like that\u2019s a really immature and petty thing to do and I don\u2019t want to spend thousands of dollars on a 10 day trip to Italy for someone\u2019s wedding who disrespects me like that. \n\nWIBTA for not going?\n\nI hope this is enough info!

She already tried that with miscarriage/fake pregnancy, and now she's trying again. Don't fall for it. Also sounds like Mitch and Ashley are stirring the pot a bit, so be careful. Keep calm, keep graceful, keep dignified. You should pity Alexis - how petty, pathetic and insecure she must be to say and do shit like this. Rise above. Just treat the wedding as one of many experiences you'll have during your anniversary trip. Don't be involved in any part of the wedding, just turn up looking relaxed, unbothered and friendly.
