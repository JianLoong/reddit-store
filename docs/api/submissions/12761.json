Our anniversary is next month. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s brother, Mitch (30M) and his girlfriend, Ashley (29F) have been together for 2 years. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s other brother, Tom (29M), and his fianc\u00e9, Alexis (27F) have been together for over 10 years and they are getting married in Italy this September. \n\nWe live in the US. \n\nAlexis and I used to be fairly close, but we had an argument a while back that we never got over. I was pregnant at the time and ended up having a miscarriage and she told my boyfriend\u2019s family that she thought I was lying about ever being pregnant. She still, to this day, swears I lied about being pregnant and when I asked her why she believes that, she said, \u201cI have a masters degree in psychology. I can tell when people are lying.\u201d So for the past 2 years, we have just always stayed civil at family events but we stay out of each other\u2019s way. \n\nWhen they announced that they were getting married in Italy and it would be a 10 day trip and they expected the whole family to be there, my boyfriend and I were already annoyed because we planned to take a long vacation elsewhere for our anniversary this year. We aren\u2019t able to do both because of money and not having enough PTO at our jobs. But we decided to get over it since it\u2019s their wedding and it\u2019s more important than our anniversary trip. \n\n\nWhen we received the wedding invitation, it only said my boyfriend\u2019s name. But on the RSVP website, it gave him an option for a plus one. So I just assumed that it would be the same for my boyfriend\u2019s brother Mitch\u2019s invitation. But his actually said \u201cMitch and Ashley\u201d on the invitation and the website. \n\nSo my boyfriend asked Tom why my name wasn\u2019t on there but Ashley\u2019s was, and Tom said there must have been some kind of mistake with the company they used for the invites. But he told my boyfriend that I was invited too. \n\nThen a few weeks later, Mitch and Ashley told my boyfriend and I that Alexis told them she purposely did not put my name on the invitation because she doesn\u2019t like me and she thought it would be funny. \n\nI feel like that\u2019s a really immature and petty thing to do and I don\u2019t want to spend thousands of dollars on a 10 day trip to Italy for someone\u2019s wedding who disrespects me like that. \n\nWIBTA for not going?\n\nI hope this is enough info!

I can't believe you even considered going after her telling people you FAKED a pregnancy and miscarriage. Purpusefully pulling this invitation stunt just sealed it. Don't go!", "NTA.

And especially no obligation to use your saved money and PTO on it.  \n\nIf your boyfriend would like to go to support his brother, maybe he only goes for a couple days around the actual wedding and you can try and find discount flights.

She already tried that with miscarriage/fake pregnancy, and now she's trying again. Don't fall for it. Also sounds like Mitch and Ashley are stirring the pot a bit, so be careful. Keep calm, keep graceful, keep dignified. You should pity Alexis - how petty, pathetic and insecure she must be to say and do shit like this. Rise above. Just treat the wedding as one of many experiences you'll have during your anniversary trip. Don't be involved in any part of the wedding, just turn up looking relaxed, unbothered and friendly. And then the next day you and your partner are on to the next glorious Italian experience!", "NTA.

This was the best they could come up with - petty semantics.  \n\nA more charitable interpretation is that OPs boyfriend is letting her know that he will support her in whatever decision she wants to make so that she doesn't feel obligated to go to the wedding out of loyalty to him and his family, but giving her the ability to choose to go to the wedding if she still wants to. If he outright said \"let's not go\" and actually OP had still wanted to go then now she no longer has that choice.", "Yes I want to clarify that I would never tell my boyfriend he can\u2019t go to his brother\u2019s wedding! If he wants to go, that\u2019s his decision and I have to respect that, even if it stings a little. But he has told me a million times that if I\u2019m not invited or don\u2019t want to go, he sure as hell would not want to go either. He said that he would only be enabling Alexis\u2019 mean behavior if he went without me.", "Haha yes. Dress code is formal attire but must be all black \ud83d\ude01", "Quick google search says it stands for be f***ing for real.", "https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bffr\n\nLikely this.", "NTA but where are your bfs parents on this? That\u2019s going to be where the real conflict will be.", "These invites are a whole other level!", "Thank you!", "And another detail I left out: Alexis makes Ashley feel very uncomfortable every time they are around each other. Mitch\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 and Alexis are very good friends and every time Alexis gets a little drunk at family gatherings, she brings up Mitch\u2019s ex to Ashley and says how much she misses her and how close they were. So Ashley avoids Alexis at all costs now.", "My boyfriend\u2019s dad is not in the picture. But his mom and Alexis recently had a disagreement that got pretty ugly and they are no longer on speaking terms. I talked to my bf\u2019s mom today about possibly not going and she said she completely understands. She does not want to go either but feels she will regret missing her son\u2019s wedding if she doesn\u2019t. So she is going & just spending the least amount of time around Alexis as possible.", "Ew\u2026. That\u2019s just gross. She sounds like a Mean Girl.", "That's troubling. There are now multiple family members she's alienating, not just you. I wonder if this could be worse than we realize \u2014 isolating a partner from their friends and family is one of the big enabling steps for abuse. We have little evidence as to whether she might be abusive to her fiance, but this is a potential red flag for him as well. He's unlikely to be willing to hear it, though.\n\nPreviously, I thought it was only you she was offending, and your BF mainly by association.", "Yeah I am realizing there are a ton of other important details that I should have brought up originally. We tried to tell his brother we felt she was abusive and manipulative before. Long story short, my bf\u2019s brother is a recovering heroin addict. He has been clean for 3 years and when he first got clean, he started putting all of his energy into working out; going to the gym, eating healthy, etc. After about a year & a half of him going to the gym every single day, she told him she wasn\u2019t comfortable with him going to the gym anymore because there \u201care girls at the gym.\u201d It\u2019s very sad because now all his energy is put into drinking alcohol. Every single day after work and all day on weekends. He might not be doing heroin anymore but now he\u2019s a functioning alcoholic \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA and NC it is. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. But Italy is a very nice vacation spot. You could always go to Italy with your boyfriend, just skip the wedding and enjoy your anniversary.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m kinda impressed that Alexis has both a masters in psychology and the emotional maturity of a kumquat.", "Honestly.... I would of turned it down after learning it was ten days.  That's pretty nervy to exspect people to pay for that.  Then for her to do that.  Send your regrets.  You simply cannot afford it.  Mentally or psychically.", "NTA.\n\nBut as a wedding gift I would buy them \"Daily Etiquette: How to Treat Yourself and Others Properly\" from Udemy.", "NTA\n\nI would tell your boyfriend the way you feel. I hope he decides not to go either.", "NTA. Take him up on it. She sounds like a nasty little gash.", "NTA. The nerve of people demanding that you use up an entire week of vacation on their wedding.", "NTA. She's a joke.", "NTA.. go and plan your anniversary and you technically dont have to RSVP since your name wasn\u2019t on then invite, as long as your bf sticks by your side and is definitely sure he doesn\u2019t want to go then he can stand up for you if his brother asks why he didn\u2019t go", "NTA  don\u2019t go especially since you are explicitly not invited but make sure your BF talks to your MIL and BIL about how she\u2019s using her psych degree to isolate him from his family and setting him up for an abusive relationship. If it isn\u2019t already. And unless she studied under Paul Ekman for years, she doesn\u2019t have a clue about lying aside from using projection to distract from her own lies.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t spend money to go to anyone\u2019s destination wedding, my family included, regardless of the invitation nonsense. When people decide to have a destination wedding they need to know some people won\u2019t go.", "Omg I know someone with the same name just like this, same degrees and everything. I hope it\u2019s not the same person.", "NTA Anyone who plans a destination wedding is more likely to be the AH.", "NTA.  I get that your bf probably feels like he has to go, but he should make it clear to his brother that this was done on purpose and he will not continue to put up with such behavior.  No matter what Alexis thinks, she's not a human lie detector.  I would also suggest that she's probably not a very good therapist either if she behaves this passive aggressively.", "How has OP been petty?", "Explain. How OP has been petty.", "Not a psychologist if she just has a masters.", "Don\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s fine to let the fam know what a piece of work Alexis actually is.\n\nNTA. And please take that anniversary trip.", "Did we just become best friends?", "Get refundable/cancelable fights and rooms, just miss the plane.", "Or reprimand the bride for  drinking in \"her delicate condition\"", "If he is recovery for drinking Italy is not the place to be.  Wine flows heavily there.  Been to restaurants where the placed a glass of it in front of you like we do water here.", "What can I say, she pissed me off. She deserves a FAFO response.", "His brother may have genuinely thought it was some kind of mistake and not a stunt his wife pulled.", "Exactly what I thought. Sitting here with my doctorate in psychology.", "You are probably right. Most men are completely oblivious to the lengths women will go through to be petty and nasty.  They simply cant comprehend it and would never even consider someone would do these things. Until they witness it but are already two kids deep in the relationship and then its just cheaper to keep her.", "Stay home, have your anniversary trip.  If they ask simply tell them you were not invited, and your boyfriend wanted to bring you not a \"plus one\" as he already has a girlfriend.", "If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t make this decision. I\u2019d leave it to my bf & go from there. While she is absolutely disrespecting you, she\u2019s also trying to sabotage your bf and his brothers relationship by causing this riff. If he wants to let it go and for you both to attend, so that he doesn\u2019t regret not witnessing his brother getting married, so be it. Their relationship matters more than this petty woman. I\u2019d throw my shoulders back and walk with pride into the wedding, knowing that I was about to outshine that ugly hearted bride, bc it\u2019d be impossible not to."]}
