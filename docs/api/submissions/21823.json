Both of us have moved out, and therefore, we don't keep our stuff at our mum's anymore.\n\nMy sister had a flight to Turkey the next day where she was scheduled to meet her husband and his family for a vacation.

Panicking, I considered wearing my mum's size L clothes, but being significantly smaller, her clothes would simply fall off me. In the end, I had to make do with some tight leggings and a small top that she'd left behind, both of which were uncomfortably tight on my stomach.\n\nMy sister finally responded when she was in Turkey and apologised. However, I can't get over the inconvenience it caused me. She has a history of similar behaviour.

She also took my mum's iron and left it in her workplace locker; we haven't seen it since.\n\nI don't want to harbour ill feelings towards her over this, but I believe she needs to compensate me for the frustration and annoyance she caused. I told her she needs to return the dress and send me the money, or else I won't talk to her. In response, she told my mum that it was no big deal since I've taken her stuff before, but I've never taken THE CLOTHES OFF HER BACK and left her stranded like this. She also has taken my stuff too and has several of my items at her house right now.\n\nSo, AITA for charging my sister \u00a3100?", "created_utc": 1688937327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14va1yx/aita_for_charging_my_sister_100_for_stealing_my/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can either tell her she has to pay to replace the dress, or return it. Telling her that she owes you \u00a3100 even if she returns the dress, is a bit over the top.", "I was with you until you said you wanted the dress AND $100. \n\nESH.", "That's a really good solution thank you!
