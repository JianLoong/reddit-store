{"id": 32978, "submission_id": "18hvpv3", "title": "AITA for taking my mom on vacation during my friend\u2019s destination wedding?", "selftext": "I (28F) am friends with Ruth (30F). We have been friends for 8 years. We met in med school and  became closer during COVID after we stayed in the same city for post-med school training (residency) until I left to finish residency in another state/city closer to family a few years ago. She's having a destination wedding in the Dominican Republic (DR) at an all inclusive resort. I am chronically single and Ruth has been engaged for 2 years. I am attending as a guest, NOT bridal party, and received my RSVP last month. I had mentioned the wedding to my mother at the time who expressed the desire to also come with me. In the moment, I told her that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking Ruth for a plus one (the RSVP was for me only) since it\u2019s Ruth\u2019s wedding, but my mom said she only wanted to go to the resort and would do her own thing the day of the wedding (ie spa, entertainment), as we\u2019d have time to do stuff on other days. She said she'd pay for the trip, which was appreciated but I would have no problem paying for just myself or both of us. Because of my busy schedule as a general surgery resident and limited vacation time it seemed like a reasonable compromise. My mom also said that she might change her mind about going and to let her know when I was planning to finalize tickets/lodging, which I was planning to do in the next few weeks (December 2023)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week Ruth reached out to see if I\u2019d booked my room and if I\u2019d be interested in staying with one of her single girl friends. I told her that I was planning to book everything in the next few weeks as I was waiting to confirm if my mom still wanted to go to the resort, but that she would not be attending the wedding festivities. Ruth then said that I should have asked her if I could bring my mom to her wedding. I reiterated that my mom would not be attending any of the wedding festivities, just the resort. She said that I should have run it by her because she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to feel obligated to invite my mom to the wedding festivities on the spot during the wedding. To be honest, I can see where she\u2019s coming from, and I told her that nothing was set in stone. I then agreed with her that I should have told her about it from the beginning. She was very upset about this, and I apologized profusely as I simply didn\u2019t think about it from her perspective. Ultimately, I said that I was happy to go by myself (hotel included). A few days later she told me that she didn\u2019t feel valued as a friend and un-invited me to her wedding and effectively ended our friendship. I\u2019m saddened that it came to this, and I do agree that I should have simply asked ahead of time. I think we\u2019re both assholes, but that her response was a bit severe.

It's a destination wedding. You mom was interested in that destination, so you planned to book together, and your mom was more than content to hang by herself on the wedding day. What am I missing? Were there additional days of wedding-related activities you were expected to be present for? NTA", "NTA \n\nYour \"friend\" is the big AH here. She had no right to insist on being informed of your mom going to the resort at the same time as her wedding! Did your \"friend\" email the resort to demand that they have to turn away any guests that weren't invited to her wedding, as well?\n\nYour mom wasn't going to the wedding festivities. She was simply going to enjoy the resort by herself then spend some time with you. \n\nI hope you don't have to work with that demanding woman. And I hope she's a better doctor than she is a friend.", "NTA.  That was a massive overreaction on Ruth's part. Makes me think she planned on putting the other guests with you all along and was just waiting for her to RSVP.  Her anger was being caught out not informing you of her plan, so she projected her guilt on you by accusing you of doing the same. And made up everything else to pile on.\n\nI don't know if anything is non-refundable. I hope not.. But either way, you and your mom should have a great vacation. Too bad Ruth isn't a real friend. \n\nMake sure you get a refund on her gift.", ">I do agree that I should have simply asked ahead of time.\u00a0\n\nWhy should you have asked ahead of time? Your mom has every right to attend any all inclusive resort at any time she wants to. She has no expectation of being invited to the wedding, and you didn't put the bride under any such obligation.\n\nYour \"friend\" really overreacted. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - who the heck has a destination wedding in another country and doesn't offer a + one??? Your mom wasn't going to horn in on the wedding, you weren't obligated to tell the bride as a guest you had someone else in your room.  If you were part of the bridal party and had responsibilities that would be different but no, the bride was an A H for sooo many reasons!", "[removed]", "NTA. Your friend's response to finding out your mom was coming is bizarre to me. You were clear to her your mom would not be attending any wedding festitivites, therefore her traveling with you has NOTHING to do with Ruth. It would have had zero impact on her or her wedding. Furthermore, Ruth isn't paying for your trip so she doesn't need to have anything \"run by her\" regarding it. She did a fabulous job of turning a non-problem into a problem and it's really sad that she felt this was horrible enough to end the friendship over.", "NTA to the extent that I don't think you even owed her an apology. It's not like she owns the entire resort and nobody else is allowed to book there, had she not wanted you to share a room with her other friend she may have never even known.\n\nYou did apologize though and took accountability and she still did this which is wild to me. Wild. Maybe take your mom to another resort during that time (or the same one if you're feeling petty).", "NTA\n\nGo on and book your trip to the same resort/time and just vacation with momma.", "Wow wow wow. The bride thinks she can gate keep a whole *country*! \n\nNTA for traveling with your mom to a resort and leaving your mom to her own devices to attend a destination party for a few hours. \n\nIt looks like the bride wanted to take up more of your time than for just the wedding and reception, and couldn\u2019t understand you have a life and made plans, *too*.\n\nI hope you and your mom have a fabulous time on vacation, unburdened by social obligations.", "NTA - absolutely not the AH. \n\nYour mother going had no impact on anything to do with the wedding. Stinks to lose a friend, but cut your loses here. Youre better off", "Your mom wasn't going to the wedding, just as a nice vacation.  Sounds like your 'friend' is a bit off kilter to say she can't go on vacation and now has 'unfriended' you.  It seems your in a win-win situation.  NTA.", "NTA.  Who you bring on a trip to a destination wedding is nobody's business, not even the bride's.  Bringing your mom was a fabulous idea, as was her plan to do a spa day on the day of the wedding.", "NTA What an entitled, self important brat. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate your time on the island. You were invited to the wedding, that\u2019s all that should be expected of your time.   \n\n\nI\u2018d still go with your mom and enjoy the resort. Obviously not go to the wedding or anything, but enjoy the time off and time with your mom.", "NTA, your mother is not even attending the wedding. Ruth definitely overreacted.", "NTA\n\nRuth is a huge one though.\n\nWhen you have a destination wedding, you have to accept that you are asking people to give up more vacation time and cash to come to your wedding than they would for a normal wedding. You might even be sucking up their one chance at a vacation for a year. That means that people will incorporate other plans into their time at your wedding.\n\nIt was totally normal of you to bring your mom on your vacation. It's Ruth's problem if she feels obligated or whatever.", "NTA. You did have to tell her someone she would never see was coming with you. What is she doing about all the other people at the resort not attending her wedding?", "Seems like a relatively easy way to get out of  the rollercoaster of a friendship with a crazy person. Hope you and your mom still have a nice vacation at some other resort. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NO!  NO!! NO!!  \nAbsolutely, positively NTA.   \nWhat kind of contortions are you doing to see Ruth's point of view? She's way, way out of line here.  \nYour mother would be no different than any of the hundreds of other people at the resort not invited to her wedding. Your mother's presence had absolutely nothing to do with her or her wedding.   \nThere is no way in hell that you had any obligation to discuss having your mother as a travel companion with Ruth.", "Ruth is not your friend. Friends don't uninvite you to their wedding over \"percieved potential pressure.\" They talk with you and find out how each of your expectations can mesh.

I\u2019d totally have a vacation if I was flying all that way, and if my mom or sister or a friend wanted to go, that\u2019s cool.  You aren\u2019t obligated to do nothing but go to the wedding.

It's bullshit.\n\nTake your mother and have fun.", "NTA\n\nYou did NOTHING wrong.", "NTA. Weddings are planned far in advance, with seating arrangements and number of meals, etc. You and your mother had no expectation that Ruth would feel put on the spot to invite your mother to the wedding! What a ridiculous thing to assume. It sounds like a miscommunication, and I don't think you had anything to apologize for. Other guests are allowed to come to the resort at the same time. It's a huge overreaction for her to un-invite you.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t have to ask. Mom was going to have fun on her own and not even look twice at the wedding.  It had nothing to do with your friend. At all. She doesn\u2019t own the resort. She was a not very nice person.", "NTA - Her uninviting you and ending the friendship is an extreme overreaction to kind of a nothing-burger. Makes me wonder if there was something else going on. I do not think this is a big loss for you in the long run, though I am sure it hurts now.", "NTA and it sounds like Ruth had someone who she wanted there but couldn't afford the room and expected you to be able to \"share\" with that person so they had a lower cost. And I hen when it didn't work out, somehow got herself worked up about everything. \n\nYour mother would have in no way impacted Ruth's wedding any more than any other guest at that hotel during the same few days. Something very off here and this may not be as much of a loss for you down the road.", "NTA - seems like she's trying to get you to subsidise the cost of one of her other friends by splitting the cost of a room with them. Take your mum on holiday and enjoy the time with her.", "NTA but she sure is.", "NTA. Your friend doesn\u2019t own the resort, nor did she book the entire place for the wedding. Therefore, you didn\u2019t have to tell her your mom was coming. You also told her your mom wasn\u2019t even coming to the wedding. You had nothing to apologize for.

It is none of Ruth's business if your mum attends the resort with you. You are paying for it, as far as Ruth knew your mum wasn't there. She didn't need to feel obligated to invite your mum. She created that drama in her own head.", "NTA and I disagree that you should have run bringing your mom to resort by her.

I would say the bride is TA for not bringing this up as soon as you were invited.  At this point in time,  I would not agree to share a room with this friend even if your mom doesn't go.  I wouldn't want to share a room with a stranger. They can figure something else out. Your friend is in for a rude surprise if she thinks she will have a private beach wedding at a hotel.  I've \"been\" to many beach weddings.   Never as an invited guest.... only as a spectator.  It is common for everyone in the vicinity of the wedding to rotate their chairs and watch the ceremony.  Because of that, I don't see a problem with your mom going with you.  She sounds like she will keep her distance and not interfere or insist on being included in the wedding.  Your friend will just have to deal with being the boss of you for one day instead of the whole vacation.  Invite your mom.  Have a good time.", "NTA.   You could have told Ruth  your Mom was coming on holiday at the same time, but since your mother wasn't going to intrude on the wedding festivities, it wasn't mandatory.

I can only assume that there will be many other people at the resort who also will have nothing to do with the wedding.\n\nWhat I'm guessing happened is that the bride was wanting to alleviate some of the cost of attending the wedding for the other girl by either having her split the cost of the reservation with OP, or by just adding her to OP's reservation.  And when OP disclosed the plans with her mother....extreme overreaction by the bride.\n\nI will never understand the tunnel vision some people get related to their weddings.  Creating strife and destroying relationships for a single (usually) overpriced event.  \n\nI get that OP was trying to keep the peace, but I would not have apologized.

It\u2019s not like Ruth can stop OP from going on a trip to the Dominican Republic that happens to fall during those dates.", "NTA\u2014OP could have booked a room and flight for Mom, traveled with her, let Mom enjoy the resort during the wedding activities, not said a word about Mom\u2019s presence at resort, and bride would been none the wiser.

Of course not.", "NTA\n\nI'm this level of petty and was thinking the same thing.", " Oh this I love!\n\n(But would never have the guts to do it myself hehe.)", "Maybe we should keep an eye on any big news coming out of the Dominican Republic...", "To my knowledge she has blocked rooms for the resort but that people (not part of the wedding party) would be free to book to stay at the resort since it is a large all inclusive resort with plenty of amenities. To be honest I think she really wanted me to room with one of her friends (that I had never met).

I\u2019m agreeing with OP that the bride wanted her to offset a friend\u2019s room cost by rooming with her friend.  I know someone who was single at my wedding paid the price for two.   At my resort the only extra cost was the actual plated private dinner/reception I had.   There were options for a semi private dinner or no reception as well, but the welcome dinner wasn\u2019t an add on cost.

Good Luck.\"\n\nAnd you're 100% correct about either the bride offering to cover somebody's accommodations and always planned on getting OP to share, or she has a friend who can't afford this, and is upset that it turns out that destination weddings are often a burden on everybody else.", "Exactly.
