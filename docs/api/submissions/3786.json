He was with our eldest son who fortunately survived with minor injuries. The accident and his subsequent death was extremely unexpected and it really hit our family hard but mostly my son as he watched his father die. One of my son's favourite hobbies is/was street art and spray painting. His dad got him into it and he'd been doing it frequently before his passing. Afterwards he stopped. He barely even wanted to talk about his father despite many attempts at therapy and 'interventions'. The day before the 5th anniversary of his death I woke up to him spray painting outside. He was busy with it all day and finished on the anniversary. It was a tribute (is that the right word?) to a moment we had on the last family trip we went on but he added wings on his father. He never spoke about it after that and hasn't spray painted again either to my knowledge.\n\nI met my husband in 2019 and we married last year. He moved in with us with his daughter and everyone's been getting along. The only problem came a few weeks ago when my husband brought up his discomfort of having to see my late husband's face everytime he looks outside. I explained to him that I understood how he felt but in the end of the day, my late husband wasn't just a husband but a father and the artwork was done by our child as part of his own grieving process. He wasn't happy but seemed to accept it. Yesterday I was having a very stressful day for a plethora of reasons that I won't bore you with. The point is that when I got home I was already on edge. My mil was home and made a comment about how inappropriate it was to have an exs face plastered outside as if it was the first time seeing it but anyways. I told her I wasn't in the mood today and she said something about me not having to not be in the mood today had I removed it when I decided to commit to another man. My husband also decided to chirp in to say he'd already tried talking to me about it and that it was a waste of time. And that's where I lost it. I don't even remember what exactly I was saying but I just started screaming and going off at them. Generally about how much it meant to my son/our family and I didn't want to hear about this anymore. My husband apologized to me later but also mentioned that I shouldn't have screamed at them like that though and that it could've been handled better even though they were admittedly wrong.

You\u2019re a Fricking widow\u2026 your son wanted to memorialize his father\u2026 so if that\u2019s how they feel about memorials\u2026 then maybe your MIL will like having her grave pissed on.

He won\u2019t be erased and they can\u2019t expect you to. You also warned them and they chose to continue the argument.", "NTA. They brought up a difficult conversation topic and you declined to participate as you were low on your emotional energy.

You are NTA. They were.\n\nI warn people if I am not in the right frame of mind for a conversation or decision. I tell them to give me time and to trust me that I will discuss it when I'm ready. If they continue to push, I'll say something like \"if I engage on this right now, it will be a reaction I may regret instead of a response I choose. I want to do this justice.\"", "NTA. Not in any way, shape, or form. They are major assholes. What do they think, that your husband will be the second coming of Jesus and yeet himself out of the artwork?", "NTA. Your late husband isn't an ex, he's dead. The mural is your son's artwork. Personally, I don't think that was a discussion he should have ever brought up, and especially shouldn't have involved his mother. Their behavior warranted whatever you screamed at them. What the fuck", "I'm sorry, you have a hard boundary here your husband has tested already and then he teams up with his mommy to attack you and then gets upset at your reaction!? Nta, tell him that if he ever brings it up again he can leave your home and not come back, same for his mommy.", "NTA. They chose not to listen when you weren't screaming; apparently the only way for them to listen to you is when you're out of patience. It's very frustrating to deal with people who have to be told no over and over and over again--and when you finally snap and yell, they say, \"why didn't you just say so?\"", "At the end of the day screaming at family member is never going to be the best choice, but you are without a doubt NTA. Thank you for defending your child and his grieving process, you sound like a very empathetic mother. And make sure to photograph the wall well incase that artwork is ever lost (like if you and your husband move) so that your son will always have it!", "NTA. I really don\u2019t understand why people, and especially in-laws, feel so threatened by widow/ers and children whose parents have died wanting to keep the memory of the spouse/parent alive. It really breaks my heart to read stories like this.", "NTA.  Yeah yeah you shouldn't scream but they were being incredibly insensitive and selfish.  MIL needs to mind her business.", "NTA. He's not your ex, he's your late husband and your son's late father. What is it with people and being jealous of people who have passed? It's not like he's gonna come back and snatch you away from the new hubs. On top of that, what does he want you to do, power wash away your son's artwork and tribute to his father? New hubs needs to step back and consider your son here.", "NTA Everyone has their breaking point.

It was a tribute by your son to his father, it's not that hard to understand.", "Please go outside right now and take high quality photos, highest resolution your phone will do, and if you know someone with a great camera, ask them to come over to do the same.

I feel like your husband wants to replace your late husband, and that can never happen.

So is the mural. \n\nHe and his mother need to accept the mural.  Screaming is not a good way of dealing with problems.", "NTA. Your husband is extremely insecure IMO.

Don't beat yourself up for raising your voice, you already made your point and they clearly didn't want to accept that stance.", "NTA. They needed to back off a long time ago on this topic. Their attitude of trying to erase your - and your son's past - is toxic. Are they really jealous of someone who has passed? \n\nSorry for your family's loss.", "NTA. While I am sure you are beating yourself up about how you handled it don\u2019t. You already explained to your current husband the reason and instead of excepting it he got is mommy involved to gang up on you. Be proud of the fact that you have defended and continue to defend your son\u2019s right to grieve. Especially because it isn\u2019t doing any harm to him or others.", "NTA They wouldn't listen when you talked, so you had to yell. They repeatedly disrespected you and your decisions when you tried to be civil. It's really not fair for the person being toxic, to then ask you to stop setting boundaries. These men and their mothers I swear. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Your late husband is not an ex. WTF is wrong with those people? If you haven't yet get a camera points at the artwork just in case it gets vandalized somehow.", "NTA, and good for standing up for your kid. Your husband married you presumably being aware that you have a kid and that his father had passed. Kids just have to be top priority for parents and this is clearly important to your sons grieving process. I know what he\u2019s saying but it\u2019s awfully selfish of him because it\u2019s clearly important to his stepson, who is also important to you who he presumably loves.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t just go from 0-60. You had already had the calm conversation. Your husband should have 100% shut his mom down. The problem with that is it\u2019s likely they\u2019ve discussed it already and clearly he did t shut it down then.\n\nThe fact is your husband married you knowing that you had all lost someone you loved very much. Also, that person isn\u2019t an EX. He was your husband and will always be the father of your children. Husband needs to take full responsibility for the situation and setting and keeping boundaries around this and any other topic with his mom.", "NTA AT ALL. I would have lost my shit too. I\u2019m glad your husband apologized but you had every right to snap after such a ridiculous display of insensitivity and guilt tripping. MIL needs to accept that you & your son have every right to honor your late husband\u2019s memory in whatever way you see fit.", "NTA. As a widow myself, this would be a deal breaker for me.", "Considering you\u2019d previously discussed it with your husband in a calm/polite/cool headed manner, and that this time it was raised by someone who the \u201cissue \u201cdoesn\u2019t pertain to (your MIL) and that prompted a (IMO) somewhat snarky comment from your husband, I\u2019m going with NTA. I think if this had been the first discussion and you\u2019d blown up immediately, you\u2019d be in possible A H territory. But clearly you\u2019re not the kind of person to blow up the first time for no reason. Also glad to hear your husband did apologise to you.\n\nETA: as someone who has their father die at a young age, I also just want to say that you\u2019re doing the right thing by your son and should feel proud of the parent you are being to him.", "NTA. \n\nHow long have you been married?\n\nI\u2019d get rid of him before he paints over the artwork. Put many protective layers on it now so that if he does try to sabotage it you have a chance to restore it.\n\nEdit- less than two years. \nCut your losses and run like the wind.", "NTA. It's not like you have wedding pictures or something of an ex husband on permanent display. This is artwork your child did to honor and remember his father.", "INFO what is it painted on? The driveway? The house? Is it something that could be moved? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA at all, just curious if it could be moved without destroying it.", "NTA", "NTA.  It is deplorable how worked up people get over someone dead, and it messes with grieving :( \n\nI wish you the best.", "The fact your current husband's ego is so fragile that he's that insecure over your deceased husband makes him an a h..you however are NTA..but your husband and MIL are.", "NTA\nThank God this was all that happened. The entire time reading this I assumed you came home to find your son's art painted over. Do you have anyway of protecting the art from sabotage?\n\nDisgusting that she called your former husband an Ex. Im sorry for your loss.", "NTA. The mural isn\u2019t of your ex. It is a mural of your son\u2019s father. Your partner who was taken unexpectedly from you and your family. \n\nYou can love and cherish the memories of your first husband and still love and cherish and make new memories with your second husband. You can love both. He isn\u2019t in competition.", "INFO: Did your husband never mention his discomfort with the mural prior to you getting married? Would you have been willing to move out of this house to a new place if he had?", "NTA. You warned them. You gave them an opportunity to drop the topic. They persisted. They earned every minute of that rightful dressing down you gave them. Next time, they should learn to drop their foolishness when you're generous enough to warn them you're not in the mood to play.", "I think NAH. I do feel for your son, but also that it must be really hard to look at a big painting of your wife\u2019s  previous husband on the outside of the house you live in. I don\u2019t think you should get rid of it for the reasons you give- it\u2019s super important to your son and would devastate him if that happened. However, your husband will never feel like it\u2019s his home while that is there, he will always feel like it\u2019s still the home of your first husband. It\u2019s akin to living in a house covered in photos of your deceased spouse or keeping it exactly as it was when they died- you and your son deserve to keep up memories of him but there\u2019s a tipping point where your new partner is made to feel unwelcome in his home. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good solution here as both your husband and son have valid but opposing reasons to remove/keep the mural.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP get some couples counseling ASAP", "nta. but i\u2019m worries your husband and his mil would try to remove or destroy it. i don\u2019t know much(anything) about street art, but you should look into ways to preserve it, even if it\u2019s from the elements. \n\nmaybe get a photographer to make a large portrait or something.", "ESH. You for not having a mature conversation. Your MiL can go take a flying f*ck. It's none of her business. \nYour son is the one that painted it. You didn't ask him to. You had no prior knowledge. \nYour husband because for some reason he's taking your son's expression of grief as a personal attack. The smart thing to do is for your husband to go to your son and ask him about his father. Maybe your husband needs to find out what kind of man your late husband was, from a son's eyes.", "YTA I thought I was going to read that they had unilaterally removed it or destroyed it without your consent which would have made them the a-holes. \n\nBut all your husband did was say you guys had discussed it and that you were stubborn? And they did this while your son wasn\u2019t around to hear it? That makes you the a-hole for yelling about it.\n\nBy the way, how old is your son and does he still live with you? Your husband shouldn\u2019t have to see that painting forever? If your son is out of the house already then you can cover it up with tarp or something so your husband doesn\u2019t have to see it all the time.", "nta\n\nthis is wayyyy worse then u are taking it they are wayy out of line.", "Please install cameras facing the art. And take tons of photos of it. Cause youre gonna come home one day to find it painted over. NTA", "NTA.\nThey were acting nauseatingly jealous of your son's late father. This had nothing to do with you, your husband, or MIL. They were wrong, they even admitted it.\nMostly, you told them you weren't in the headspace to argue about this anyway, and not only did they press on, but they took a few jabs at you. Even if it wasn't the \"right\" thing to do, it was their fault. \nLike the saying goes: Don't poke a bear that said \"Dude I'm on edge already, don't poke me or I'll bite.\"", "You are beyond NTA. I would not be able to trust my spouse if they went here, and then that his mother felt it was appropriate to bring this opinion to you, and he let her? I agree with others who have said that she would not have backed off if you had reacted less strongly. Personally I\u2019m not willing to be in relationship when someone doesn\u2019t believe me the first time especially In something so important. Your late husband is the father of your children, his memory will always be with you, and I\u2019m glad for you. He\u2019s also not great competition, being dead. Any partner who doesn\u2019t get this is so insensitive.", "NTA they kept poking the bear and was surprised when the bear bit their heads off", "Yes, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled. You should apologize while still acknowledging that they were in the wrong.", "NTA and if your MIL marries again, will your husband be quite happy for her to erase every image of FIL? Has he erased every image of his daughter's mother? Or is that different because she's (presumably) still alive?\n\nApart from it being not MIL's business to comment at all, your current husband's attitude is raising red flags. Your son's father/your late (NOT ex) husband cannot and should not be erased from your lives. And watch out that he/someone doesn't paint over it; make sure he knows that any damage/defacement will signal the end of your relationship.", "NTA. How insecure can they get to feel jealous over a deceased person?", "NTA. What sad, pathetic people who are jealous of a dead man. Make your hubby an ex unless he can set boundaries with his mother. Your son will tag her on a street post with devil horns and a pitchfork - at best. Buy the supplies for him as tacit permission.", ">(Gotta say I read this expecting them to have painted over it so am glad at least that   \n>  \n>that didn\u2019t happen.)\n\nI had the same thought. I hope they've gotten a lot of pictures of it, at least. A recreation wouldn't be the same, but there should at least be a record.", "It could still happen.  OP, you need to sit down with the new husband and the MIL, apologize for yelling, and explain that the art outside is your son's last connection to his father.  You loved your late husband.  You love your current husband.  There is nothing wrong with having loved someone before and having children with him.  You refuse to erase your past and your memories.  If anything happens to that artwork, your son would be destroyed, your marriage would be over, and police charges would be filed.", "Lol me too! I thought it was going to painted or damaged. Whew!!", "They havent painted over it yet you mean. I fully expect OP to come home one day in the next year to find it painted over", "Would they insist that they burn all photos of the former husband/father, too? Would the son not be allowed to have photos of his father?\n\nThis is red flag behaviour, IMO. They're acting like the deceased husband is an ex. As if OP comes from a broken relationship, rather than being a widow. This isn't a situation where OP has fallen out of love with her former partner, but one where they lost them.\n\nOP's new husband and MIL need to understand that. They need to respect that OP's first husband is not an ex, but a deceased loved one. They are not someone to be discarded, any more than a deceased mother or father. No-one would ask you to get rid of artwork depicting your dead parents, because anyone with an ounce of empathy would understand that you still have love for your lost loved ones.\n\nNew hubby and MIL are demonstrating jealousy over a dead relative. That needs to be addressed in order for the relationship to continue. This needs to be discussed and possibly moved into couple's counselling, in order for it to be resolved. It won't go away on its own.", "The son wanted to memorialize his EX Father, it's perfectly understandable that new dad wouldn't like that.  /s", "> They chose not to listen when you weren't screaming; \n\nRead it again. The husband did listen and explained to his mom that there was no point in discussing it.", "Additionally, thank you for defending your son.  Be sure step dad doesn't take this out on him.", "A professional photographer to get an amazing photo ready for if/when son moves out! (So he can display the photo or recreate the art. Or both!)\n\nAnd hopefully not needed before.", "Yes, make it crystal clear that if they ever took it upon themselves to ruin the artwork that would be the end of the relationship.", "Well, if it comes to that I imagine OP would have both a late husband AND an ex-husband.", "I will absolutely die on the hill of late versus ex. It is a very clear indication of divorced versus widowed and to refer to her late husband, her traumatized child\u2019s late father, as her ex is enragingly disrespectful", "No I teared up, too. It's so bittersweet.   \n\n\nNTA, btw.", "Laughter is the right response, because it's unreasonable to be upset about a child's tribute to a deceased parent.", "Considering husband chimed in in a salty way because now his mother is backing him up and he can hide behind her. I bet he just thought she'd just roll over if they fought her on it together. But they knew she wasn't in a good mood and were positively shocked at her going off. Like dude, what did you expect", "How big is it?\n\nDoes your son still live with you?", "I completely agree", "THIS. It appears that hubby and his mom are competing against OP's dead spouse. They will always lose. I don't get why these folks don't understand that OP's deceased husband had a large part in making OP who she is. NTA AT ALL.", "I mean, studies have shown that if your mom had survived the cancer, there was a really good chance your dad would have divorced her during the treatment and recovery. Men are far more likely than women to leave a partner if they get seriously ill like with cancer and other long term terminal illnesses", "That\u2019s no joke. What I don\u2019t get is why husband sees OP\u2019s late husband as competition. It\u2019s not stated whether current husband is divorced or a widower but it shouldn\u2019t matter as both previous spouses are in the past. OP was widowed for a lot of years, the mural is precious to her as a tribute to her late husband and her sons father.\n\nEdit: It doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t open her heart to her current husband and commit to him.", "Me too. My dad never admitted to wanting a divorce, but I\u2019m pretty sure he was cheating on my mom while she was dying of lung cancer. He had a female \u201cfriend who popped up right after my mom died. She even helped us pick out our funeral outfits (my sister and I were 11). And then he had a string of \u201cfriends\u201d that we also had never heard of before and haven\u2019t seen since. He got into a serious relationship I thinkkkk about a year after my mom died. \n\nIt definitely sucks and it\u2019s a really awful thing to put the pieces together for a situation like that. I\u2019m immensely sorry to you and anyone else who has ever experienced a situation like that.", "I know the statistics, but it doesn't apply in the situation. The cancer was caught so late and everything happened so quick that there was never even discussion of dealing with longterm illness. I've never been able to deal with counterfactuals / \"what ifs\" around my mom because it happened when I was so young.", "I think it depends on whether the son still lives with them."]}
