On the flip side, you have been a parentified child for so long, your guilt is stopping you from doing the right thing for yourself, because you don't want to \"abandon\" your siblings.

When a child is forced to take on the parental role of a sibling because the actual parent refuses to do the parenting. \n\n1. I think it's obvious you need to find a way to get your own place. I know its not that simple, but start thinking about it and coming up with a plan. How much money would you have to save? Can you pick up any side gigs to help make a little more? Are there friends or other people you could potentially be roommates with? Just start thinking, because your brother is not your responsibility and you deserve to have a safe place where you can trust your things won't get destroyed. You deserve to feel at peace in your own home and feel like you're slave is a safe space. \n\n2. It sounds like his autism often gets used to excuse a lot of crappy behavior. Which is a huge disservice to him. Because he's not unable to learn or understand, but if you're mom isn't going to bother to teach him boundaries, his life is gonna be a lot harder when he's an adult and gets a dose of reality. That's not your problem though. You're not his mother. But sadly, it does affect you. Especially if your little brother tells you to just let it go too. You might try talking to him, asking him to think about how he would feel if you just went into his bedroom and threw his things all over the floor (and use whatever he really cares about as an example, those prized action figures or his favorite games. How would he feel if you took that nice actin figure out of the box and tossed it in the ground). He's old enough to be able to have some damn empathy, and maybe he's just never been forced to think about it from someone else's perspective. \n\nBut more likely, he's probably just kind of an entitled brat, which is a result of a lack of parenting. That really is gonna bite your mom in the ass as he grows older. \n\n3. DEFINITELY put a lock on your door. Like an actual, robust, can't be torn off lock. You deserve to keep your possessions safe. You deserve to know your things won't be broken when you leave for five minutes, and it's unfair of you to always be expected to sacrifice and just \"get over it.\" And if your mom tries to be all \"oh well it's not his fault, he's autistic\" you NEED to make her understand that NO. Autism doesnt mean he's stupid. Being autistic doesn't make him incapable of understanding things or learning boundaries. And what's gonna happen in the future? If he takes someone else's things and breaks them, gets charged with theft or property damage, are the cops or a judge just gonna let him off and say it's okay to break the law because he's autistic? No, because that's not how the world works. And your mother NEEDS to understand that. \n\nI'm sure she'll try to use his autism as an excuse, but that's BS. And it's not only unfair to you, it's unfair to him and setting him up for failure in life. \n\nSadly, there aren't easy solutions for this. \nBut I promise you're not crazy, you're not overreacting or being mean by wanting your space to be respected.
