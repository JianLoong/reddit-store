{"id": 25972, "submission_id": "166q6ci", "title": "AITA for cussing out my aunt for not treating me the same as the other nieces and nephews?", "selftext": "I'm 16M, and for some reason, I've never felt like I've been treated right by anyone on my mom's side of the family. It's like they treat me like a second-class citizen.\n\nI've talked to my folks about this, but they just keep saying it's all in my head.\n\nSo this week, my mom's sister decides she's gonna take all the nieces and nephews to an amusement park. I tell my mom I'm not going because I know it'll be another round of getting the short end of the stick. Mom insists I go to keep an eye on my younger twin sibs (a 5M a 5F, almost 6). So, for their sake, I go. Usually, our families have a older child around my age along with younger siblings close in age to mine sibs. Everyone gets an invite, the older nieces and nephews, like me, and the younger ones.My aunt says we're going in two cars, one she's driving, the other by a cousin.\n\nShe shows up at my place in the morning, doesn't even give me a nod. When she sees I'm joining, she straight-up tells me she didn't know I'd be UNFORTUNATELY tagging along. I'm already taken aback by how bold she is about not wanting me there.\n\nWe hit the road and stop for lunch at a restaurant. Up until then, everyone's been acting like I'm invisible, not a word directed my way, except from my sibs.\n\nThe restaurant's set up like this: You go up to the counter, order, eat, then pay on the way out.\n\nMy aunt starts jotting down everyone's orders to take to the counter. I'm waiting for her to ask me, but she just pretends I'm not there. As she's heading to the counter, I remind her she forgot to ask me what I want. She has the audacity to say I can go order myself, that I'm old enough to handle it, and she's not my waitress and doesn't owe me anything. But even my cousin who's driving she doesn't suggest to order by himself.\n\nFor the sake of my sibs, I suck it up, go to the counter, and place my order. My food's ready quicker than everyone else's. Maybe 'cause I ordered solo. So, I grab my grub and start chowing down at the table. My aunt comes over and tells me to stop eating and wait for the others. I tell her my food's gonna get cold, and I prefer eating it hot. She tells me to go sit at a different table if I can't wait for them, and that I won't be missed at the main table.\n\nI politely asked my aunt to cut it out with the way she was treating me, that her words were really getting to me, and that she could treat me the same as she did with the other nieces and nephews. She shot back saying she treated me the way I deserved. I couldn't take it anymore and told her to go f- off. I called an Uber and split, leaving her to handle my two siblings and the other cousins on her own.\n\nMy folks are pissed at me, even my grandparents gave me a piece of their minds, telling me to apologize.\n\nI ain't about to apologize. AITA?  \n\n\nINFO: I truly don't know the reason why she treats me like this. I've felt that she's treated me poorly since I was a child. So I can't provide more context. My parents insist that she treats me normally, that it's all in my head. This is the first time I've reacted after years of her ignoring me or treating me differently from the way she treats the other nieces and nephews.", "created_utc": 1693523266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166q6ci/aita_for_cussing_out_my_aunt_for_not_treating_me/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forgive me if this is wrong and triggering but, You're an affair child. One of your parents cheated but reconciled yet your Aunt knows and was furious about it. She is still in contact with your parents for some reason and your parents don't want to do anything to make her cut contact. \n3. This maybe goes hand in hand with the previous one, maybe if it is an affair, your mother's affair partner was a boyfriend of your Aunt. \n4. You unwillingly caused an accident or trauma when you were very young to remember, and your aunt resents you for it. \n\nThat's all I have.. The whole entire thing of treating you like your deserve makes it more puzzling. Maybe you should ask your other aunts and uncles, if there are any and see if they know.
