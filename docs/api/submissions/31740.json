I (23F) have been with my boyfriend for ten months. It was his twin sisters wedding three weeks ago and I was his plus one. A lot of things went wrong on her wedding day. First her makeup artist cancelled, then their grandfather got into a car accident, then the bartender cancelled as well. When the bartender cancelled my boyfriend offered me to do it. I am a bartender as my fulltime job and I did want a break from work since this was my only day off for weeks but I agreed with a bawling bride in front of me. \n\n\nMy boyfriend told me that it was a smell set up with a limited bar but when we got there it wasnt. I could tell it was an open bar, and yup\u2026 I was pissed. I couldnt back out then though and I was swarmed all night. I was wearing a tight dress and strappy heels that were a bitch to take off so I had to have them on all night. Six straight hours of overly drunk people yelling at me. Im not sure if they thought too much of an open bar since a lot of people got way too drunk and had to leave early or were acting crazy. \n\n\nAfter that my boyfriends sister sent me a long text thanking me profusely saying she so happy I helped out so much and was grateful. I replied thank you and thought she would send a form of compensation but nothing. I felt awkward asking first so I brought it up to my boyfriend and he looked confused saying it was a favor and there was no compensation and that their parents already paid the bartender a lot of money and they weren't getting a full refund plus all the alcohol they bought for the open bar, it would be out of budget and inappropriate for me to ask them to pay me AFTER the wedding already happened. He said his parents planned the wedding not his sister so it would be them that paid me and thats not okay for me to do since they spent so much money already. And that I was being an asshole to even want to ask.\n\nI felt horrible and I told my parents when I saw them over the weekend and they told me that he was manipulating me and that I do deserve to be paid for working 6 hours. My dad says he was the one to volunteer me in the first place and put me in an uncomfortable situation to say no with the bride right in front of me. My mom says they should give me half the refund they receive from the original bartender and add another half and to ask them myself directly.

Your bf manipulated you by volunteering your bartending services *in front* of the crying bride. Of course you said yes.  You worked on your day off in a cocktail dress and heels while being berated by drunk guests.  By not paying you, they (the bride, his parents and your bf) are saying that  your time and skills are worthless.", "NTA. They absolutely should pay you for your time and energy. You didn\u2019t volunteer, you were volunteered. That absolutely requires compensation unless you agree to do it for free, which you never did. Your boyfriend needs to get his head out of his ass and let his parents know you deserve compensation.

He knowingly asked you in front of her, so you couldn't really say no without looking like an asshole. \n\nHowever, you should have either said no, or asked for compensation up front. You're still NOT an asshole though. \n\nHow are they not getting a full refund on what they paid the person who did not show up? Lol. They're either lying, or they got swindled by giving someone money who never even stepped foot at the wedding. \n\nThe only asshole here is your worthless boyfriend.", "You're being gaslighted. You provided a very valuable professional service at a time they REALLY needed it. Their inability to get a full refund from the no-show bartender is on them, not you. They should pay you at least as much as the no-show bartender was supposed to get, and probably 50% to 100% more for stepping into the breach.", "NTA, I would be mad as well. More so for being volunteered to work. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to request payment, but you best be ready to be disliked by your bf\u2019s family. \n\nYou were put in a terrible position by your boyfriend.

I'm guessing you didn't really get much time to eat, and probably never got to hang out or dance with your boyfriend. Nobody offered to bring you comfy shoes, or offered to watch the bar for a while so that you could eat properly or visit with your bf. Hell, you bf could have offered to help you. But, nope!

Doesn't make you obligated to slave labour.", "NTA.\n\nThey openly admit knowing that bartenders should be paid since they paid the one who cancelled on them.\n\nOne question though, did you have out tip jars at the open bar?", "NTA: If they were going to pay the original bartender, why do you not deserve to be paid.

And his parents should have kissed your ass while throwing money at you.\n\nNTA, but please dump this guy.

Just because you work as a bartender doesn\u2019t mean people can expect you to bartend at every event if they need one. What does this BF do? Volunteer him somewhere and see how he likes it.", "NTA.

They thought OP is here for free, why pay anyone else.", "Nothing like being voluntold. BF is an ass. I'm sure he had a great time at the wedding because he wasn't working his ass off.\n\nAnd how dare all those guests be so rude to you. I would have said fuck it the first time someone yelled at you and told your BF it was his turn to play bartender because you needed something to eat, had to use the ladies room and the feet were killing you because you expected to be attending a wedding as a guest.\n\nI agree with all the people saying to leave him because you've seen the worst of these people and it'll be your life if you stay.\n\nYou deserve better OP.

I am happy to extend a friends and family discount, bringing it to Z. I spoke to Dick, and he stated that you are the one handling payments.

Somehow I suspect he already pocketed the money.", "Ideally you won't ever see these people again after this since this is for sure a deal breaker. Ask for the money.", "The best scenario is that you ask the parents (or give them an invoice for your services) and they pay you. Easy peasy yet this may cause a rift between your BF and you but it\u2019s already weird because he\u2019s not treating you respectfully about getting paid. Someone along the way may have made promises or assumed free labor on your behalf but that is for them to sort out. Get that well deserved coin!", "I would. The bartender was going to be paid, you should be", "Definitely reach out to his sister or parents.   They had planned to pay another bartender, and shouldn\u2019t assume that you would do it for free just because you\u2019re dating their son.  If they try to brush you off, they are AHs like your boyfriend.  And why didn\u2019t your bf come and help you bar tend, at least during the busier times?   The fact that he volunteered you then didn\u2019t offer to help says as much about his character as him making excuses about why you shouldn\u2019t get paid.", "Since you\u2019re going to leave him anyway (\ud83d\udea9 right?? \ud83d\udea9) just let his parents and sister know what they owe you. Do not just ask for compensation. Name a specific figure for six hours of bartending + tips and suggest the payment method you prefer. This is not the time to be subtle.", "Yes go and ask directly, he's running interference between you and his parents for a reason", "Yup, and when I\u2019m volunteered by others at work, I still get paid for my work. So do most of us, I expect, as should the OP. Bring paid the going rate for the work is the *least* they owe the OP.", "NTA!!! OP should send them a bill for her time, plus a huge tip!!! She should also dump the bf!", "Yeah there's no way they didn't get a full refund from the bartender that canceled. Why would that bartender keep any of the money?", "I agree with all of this with one caveat - all of this, including the compensation, should have been discussed *before* the wedding. Bringing it up after the wedding just doesn't sit right.", "The gift returned would be odd, but I agree with the rest.", "70 meters? But the wall is 50 meters tall!\n\nI literally just started rewatching Attack on Titan and, well, here I am.", "They're a spam bot hunter.  They (and I) help get rid of copy bots in this reddit.", "You, I like. \n\n\nI sincerely hope OP sees this comment, it's given me the giggles!", ">You seem like the kind of people who would be embarrassed for using a professional service for an unfair price, in this case free\n\nOoohh I like this line. I like this line very much.", "I would be petty enough to go on social media and tell her experience of attending the wedding. That will not be a good look for the family.", "Yes, of course you\u2019re paid at work. I was more amusingly highlighting a term (voluntold) we use at work for being involuntary volunteered.", "I have to wonder if both the bartender and MUA canceled because they had not been paid.", "I was thinking the exact thing, but the water works show would be a lot of theatrics for a not pre-planned dupe. So they either took advantage of a bad situation or they're panhandle by day live in a mansion at night level of grifters. OP should get her money and run this guy's sleezy af!!!", "But if they don\u2019t get married, who\u2019s gonna tend bar at his wedding?", "Yeah just pull out a gun at the register?! It would have came off as super manipulative and heartless if she would have started talking payment while his sister is bawling and stressing. But you are right she was being manipulated at that very moment. Slave labor working for thank yous, kind thoughts, and others opinions maybe if she knew that was her payment, she could have just sat down and enjoyed the wedding. ...", "Only guests are obliged to give a gift, OP\u2019s status changed from guest to service vendor at the last minute. She was effectively disinvited as a guest, she doesn\u2019t owe them a gift.", "He thinks it makes his argument about the parents spending too much, better.\n\nNTA, of course. Go talk to the parents, but I'm sure you are going to find out more about the situation than just money.", "Agreed - more meant it as an analogy that may be easier for OP to see why OP was ripped off. I could\u2019ve also used wedding cake maker.", "No, that\u2019s trashy to blast it all over social media. Handle it privately like an adult.", "Or, BF took the money they were going to pay OP and pocketed it.", "Or what if they say we already gave bf x amount to pay you?", "BF probably has a weird relationship with money if parents are always paying for stuff.", "Maybe the bride didn\u2019t know. It could have been something parents and op\u2019s boy friend planned out", "Exactly", "I feel a little yucky speculating about this but I kinda think y\u2019all are right. It\u2019s a little sketchy and definitely sounds plausible.", "What other reason would the BF have for not wanting OP to even bring it up?", "No idea man, maybe his parents spent more than they\u2019d have liked to and are in bad shape financially? Maybe they paid for the entire event on credit cards and don\u2019t have any liquid assets to pay her? Regardless, any of those possibilities would require giving him and his family the benefit of the doubt and that\u2019s asking a lot.", "Probably just afraid of his parents like a lot of men to be fair.", "Yeah, that is not really a good reason. If they were having finacnial difficultites, you don't throw a big wedding, with an open bar. \n\nBut if you do, you have the grace to talk to the person who worked for you at the last minute about it.", "Press \"F\" to doubt....\n\nNaw, I aint buying that."]}
