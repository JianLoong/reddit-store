I (23F) have been with my boyfriend for ten months. It was his twin sisters wedding three weeks ago and I was his plus one. A lot of things went wrong on her wedding day. First her makeup artist cancelled, then their grandfather got into a car accident, then the bartender cancelled as well. When the bartender cancelled my boyfriend offered me to do it. I am a bartender as my fulltime job and I did want a break from work since this was my only day off for weeks but I agreed with a bawling bride in front of me. \n\n\nMy boyfriend told me that it was a smell set up with a limited bar but when we got there it wasnt. I could tell it was an open bar, and yup\u2026 I was pissed. I couldnt back out then though and I was swarmed all night. I was wearing a tight dress and strappy heels that were a bitch to take off so I had to have them on all night. Six straight hours of overly drunk people yelling at me. Im not sure if they thought too much of an open bar since a lot of people got way too drunk and had to leave early or were acting crazy. \n\n\nAfter that my boyfriends sister sent me a long text thanking me profusely saying she so happy I helped out so much and was grateful. I replied thank you and thought she would send a form of compensation but nothing. I felt awkward asking first so I brought it up to my boyfriend and he looked confused saying it was a favor and there was no compensation and that their parents already paid the bartender a lot of money and they weren't getting a full refund plus all the alcohol they bought for the open bar, it would be out of budget and inappropriate for me to ask them to pay me AFTER the wedding already happened. He said his parents planned the wedding not his sister so it would be them that paid me and thats not okay for me to do since they spent so much money already. And that I was being an asshole to even want to ask.\n\nI felt horrible and I told my parents when I saw them over the weekend and they told me that he was manipulating me and that I do deserve to be paid for working 6 hours. My dad says he was the one to volunteer me in the first place and put me in an uncomfortable situation to say no with the bride right in front of me. My mom says they should give me half the refund they receive from the original bartender and add another half and to ask them myself directly.

Your parents are right.  Your BF is TA.  Your dad is right about how you BF manipulated you.  The fact he called you an asshole for asking is reason enough to end it with him.", "NTA.  Your bf manipulated you by volunteering your bartending services *in front* of the crying bride. Of course you said yes.  You worked on your day off in a cocktail dress and heels while being berated by drunk guests.  By not paying you, they (the bride, his parents and your bf) are saying that  your time and skills are worthless.", "NTA. They absolutely should pay you for your time and energy. You didn\u2019t volunteer, you were volunteered. That absolutely requires compensation unless you agree to do it for free, which you never did. Your boyfriend needs to get his head out of his ass and let his parents know you deserve compensation. If they aren\u2019t going to go make the bartender they didn\u2019t show up give a full refund, that\u2019s on them, but you are owed compensation, no question.", "NTA.

I\u2019d part ways so I could find a partner who does value me.", "NTA.\n\nI would reconsider dating this person if I were in your shoes. He knowingly asked you in front of her, so you couldn't really say no without looking like an asshole. \n\nHowever, you should have either said no, or asked for compensation up front. You're still NOT an asshole though. \n\nHow are they not getting a full refund on what they paid the person who did not show up? Lol. They're either lying, or they got swindled by giving someone money who never even stepped foot at the wedding. \n\nThe only asshole here is your worthless boyfriend.", "You're being gaslighted. You provided a very valuable professional service at a time they REALLY needed it. Their inability to get a full refund from the no-show bartender is on them, not you. They should pay you at least as much as the no-show bartender was supposed to get, and probably 50% to 100% more for stepping into the breach.", "NTA, I would be mad as well. More so for being volunteered to work. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to request payment, but you best be ready to be disliked by your bf\u2019s family. \n\nYou were put in a terrible position by your boyfriend. If you haven\u2019t already, I would let him know he\u2019s not to volunteer you for anything without speaking to you privately first.

You walked in expecting to be a plus one at a wedding, and suddenly forced-ish (I mean, it's hard to say no to a crying bride who is the twin of your boyfriend) to bartend, stand in your heels for 6+ hours, and get screamed at by drunk people. I'm guessing you didn't really get much time to eat, and probably never got to hang out or dance with your boyfriend. Nobody offered to bring you comfy shoes, or offered to watch the bar for a while so that you could eat properly or visit with your bf. Hell, you bf could have offered to help you. But, nope! His whole family sucks, and your bf should be in your corner (or pay you himself) especially since he's the one who offered them your services before asking you.", "NTA. No wonder the other vendors backed out.

If they aren't getting a full refund for the bartender cancelling *then that is their problem*. You were manipulated into working a full shift instead of being a guest that you, presumably, had to take time off work to enjoy.\n\nYour boyfriend can pay you, since *he's* the one who ended up \"hiring\" the bartender. Or go direct to his parents and say that you expect to be compensated. Start polite, but eventually move to the point where, should you stay with your boyfriend, you remind them that every wedding, holiday and event you're going to remind *everyone* about how rude they were to you. And they couldn't even pay you for it.\n\nSucks that things went wrong for them. Doesn't make you obligated to slave labour.", "NTA.\n\nThey openly admit knowing that bartenders should be paid since they paid the one who cancelled on them.\n\nOne question though, did you have out tip jars at the open bar?", "NTA: If they were going to pay the original bartender, why do you not deserve to be paid. Not only that, but it was a more busy situation then was advertised so even if it was originally a favour i feel the added workload deserves compensation at the very least.

I'm kind of floored by how much of an asshole your boyfriend is. And his parents.\n\nHe volunteered your services in front of his crying sister. He lied to you about the setup. He called you an asshole for wanting to be paid.\n\nInstead of falling all over you with gratitude, he insulted you. And his parents should have kissed your ass while throwing money at you.\n\nNTA, but please dump this guy. I'm sorry for your wasted hours of work, but in the greater scheme of things, it was a small price to pay to find out how awful your boyfriend is.", "Nope, NTA here.  They need to pay you!", "NTA, your boyfriend is the problem. He volunteered your services before discussing it, and lied about the scope of the job. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting paid, frankly.", "Dump the BF. You\u2019ve only been together 10 months and he already acts like he owns you? First, you own yourself - now and forever.

If he or someone else does that, it\u2019s okay to say \u201coh, I\u2019m just here as a guest, I\u2019m not working.\u201d Second, the BF is an asshole for calling you an asshole for asking to be paid for doing a job. Just because you work as a bartender doesn\u2019t mean people can expect you to bartend at every event if they need one. What does this BF do? Volunteer him somewhere and see how he likes it.", "NTA.  Also the bride's parents should sue the bartender for a full refund plus whatever exorbitant fee the OP charges for the late emergency booking of her services.", " NTA. And any refund should definitely go to OP.  The boyfriend is an AH for volunteering on someone else\u2019s behalf.", "They cancelled the bartender, hence got only a partial refund. They thought OP is here for free, why pay anyone else.", "Nothing like being voluntold. BF is an ass. I'm sure he had a great time at the wedding because he wasn't working his ass off.\n\nAnd how dare all those guests be so rude to you. I would have said fuck it the first time someone yelled at you and told your BF it was his turn to play bartender because you needed something to eat, had to use the ladies room and the feet were killing you because you expected to be attending a wedding as a guest.\n\nI agree with all the people saying to leave him because you've seen the worst of these people and it'll be your life if you stay.\n\nYou deserve better OP.

If you want to be with him, let it go and if you\u2019re done with the relationship then absolutely go nuclear and get your money back.

Pretty AH move of him in the first place to make you work when you were supposed to be a guest.", "Why would the original bartender get anything?

I'm not keen on \"cut him loose\" over one transgression, but this is a serious red flag. He doesn't value your time or energy, didn't care it was your only day off in over a month, dismissed you when you said you wanted to be compensated for work you had little opportunity to say no to.\n\n10 months? This is supposed to be the honeymoon period in which he's still trying to keep you for the long haul and vice versa until the long-term, deeper love comes. You've already gone above and beyond to be a damn good partner just for the wedding alone.\n\nETA because of clumsy fingers: what has he done for you?

And in heels!!", "NTA. The advice given here is excellent. Might I suggest that you take along one or both of your parents when you speak to the parents of the bride regarding your withheld payment?

I want to caveat this that I've seen multiple professionals help out others for free for several hours e.g. a builder friend helping build an outdoor bar.\n\nHowever where I think this is different are:\n\n1.

As a minimum I would expect the hosters to get a very expensive gift to say thank you for saving the day.\n\n2. You were voluntold\n\n3.

I'd be grumpy but I could see it. What I see as far worse is you boyfriend who a) set up this situation, b) isn't protecting your interest on behalf of his offer/family and c) his argument is \"they've already paid lots of money to professionals so why should they pay more for additional services they asked for even though they are getting money back?\"that would very much make me question the integrity of that person", "NTA\nrun.", "NTA.
