Your brother was trying to open up to you and your response was to say \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d His experiences were traumatizing, and though you may not care about his being in the military you should care about the impact it had on him. Not because he\u2019s your brother, but because he\u2019s a human being that lives through horrible traumatic experiences.", "YTA \n\nI was with you until the end. He was telling you he wished you were closer and you essentially said you don\u2019t care.", "YTA. He opened up and was trying to reach out to you and you basically threw it in his face by using the experience that he is most fragile about to hurt him. You completely lack any compassion or empathy and you did it out of spite and jealousy because you think he got more attention than  you did. You're 21 not 12 grow the hell up.", "YTA. What\u2019s wrong with you?? He fights in a war and you basically say you dont care about your sibling relationship or the fact he fought in a war? Then you make him cry about it all??? YTA heavy on YTA.\n\nIf you were frustrated that \u201ceverything was about him\u201d all the time that isnt his fault. That\u2019s the fault of everyone lacking to show you some attention growing up, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to basically say \u201cI dont really give two sh*ts about you and your life\u201d to him.", "YTA Firstly, you seem to lack any empathy whatsoever for Nick. Your brother was clearly trying to work on your relationship and bond with you. Your response about not caring about the fact he went to war, which clearly had a major impact on both him and his mental health, was just cruel.\n\nUnlike you, your brother is actually trying to fix your relationship. And you're going out of your way to push him away. Also, there is a MASSIVE age gap here, which I'm confident plays a huge factor in why you two were never close to begin with. He was already an adult by the time you were born.\n\nEither way, would it kill you to have a little compassion?", "YTA\n\nWow.... You really need to watch a few documentaries on what the men and women went through over there. Not just there. In Vietnam, Korea, WWII, and WWI. You really have no clue. It's quite clear as you (multiple times) make it seem like it's no big deal and how everyone is just coddling your brother. What's worse is that your brother was trying to open up to you. This was him trying start a relationship with you.", "YTA\n\nBeing in the military is a struggle, much less being in a war. Everything being about Nick isn't really Nick's fault, but the people who make it about him (e.g parents). It's fine to not be close to a sibling but you should let him know whether or not you want a relationship with him or not.", "YTA. I agree that military idolization is played too often. But the mental impact of time served is real. And if you want a relationship with him, you will need to accept that his issues from service are a part of who he is now. Be his support the best you can (while still enforcing your own boundaries, if needed). Encourage him to seek professional help.", "YTA he confided in you about experiencing trauma while serving and you said that you didn\u2019t care. He wants to have a relationship with you and you hurt him for no reason. Why?! You made him cry. He probably has PTSD or depression or both! And it does matter. That was ignorant and nasty.\n\nHe wants to be friends!", "YTA. Do some research on PTSD and try having some empathy for your brother.", "So\u2026your brother made himself vulnerable to you, expressed his sorrow that his PTSD and other war-related traumas made it hard to build a relationship with you and you\u2026told him that you didn\u2019t care because you grew up in a family dealing with the return of a traumatized soldier.\n\nYTA, and incredibly self-centered. Yes, having a relative with special needs can be exhausting but at your age, you should have either dealt with it or sought therapy to get help dealing with it.", "YTA, because even if he was not your brother, even forgetting he had PTSD from being in the military, he's a guy who's trying to open up to another guy, and that about his mental issues, and to to be told bluntly \"I don't care\" is the worst a man can face from another.  Men need to be more empathetic to other men, period.\n\nYou can hide behind your young age, or that you feel he hogged some of your limelight, but you are only coming off as a major pissant.  The military as a system is just an exploitative institution, but the people it crushes are real, and you being a jerk to one of them is major Aholery", "If you were to take out the fact that he served in the Military during war time. A person who never caused you harm apologizes that they could not be closer to you and you dumped all over him. What does that make you?", "Spoken like a kid. Yta", "YTA. Look, I\u2019m not super rah rah military. I don\u2019t think military service should be elevated above all other possible kinds of service, which seems like something a lot of people in our country do. And I don\u2019t necessarily think military trauma should be treated as more special than any other possible trauma. But what you said would be rude and hurtful no matter what his trauma was. \n\nLike take literally any other traumatic life event and imagine saying what you said. This is something that affected your brothers entire life. It messed him up really bad. And of COURSE therefore it affected his relationship with you. And you said \u201cI don\u2019t care that this happened to you.\u201d  This translates to \u201cI don\u2019t care about you.\u201d", "Let\u2019s imagine that you are in a car accident.   You spend two years in the hospital recovering (yes, that can happen) and after that you still have about ten years\u2019 worth of physiotherapy to deal with before you can walk normally again.\n\nImagine if you went through all that.   Then you apologised to your dad, a person you love, because you haven\u2019t been able to play sports with him all this time.\n\nYour dad says, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your car accident or how badly hurt you were.   It\u2019s your fault that you weren\u2019t around on game days, and I am never going to forgive you for that.\u201d\n\nWould that be fair?  Would your dad be an asshole for treating you like that?\n\nTry to grow some compassion before something happens and *you* end up needing compassion yourself.   I guarantee that it will happen before the end.  No one gets through life unscathed.  YTA.", "YTA. It changed him as a person and was a massive time in his life and you said you don't care.", "YTA. He was obviously trying to connect with you. Just because *you* don't remember the Iraq war doesn't mean it wasn't significant to your brother, and consequently impacted his personality and how he has related to you. Please educate yourself about PTSD and the long lasting impact of combat on those who have served. You were terribly insensitive to a person when they were in a vulnerable space.", "YTA. Oh boy you are TA. He served his country during a war and suffered major psychological trauma (Which is very common and really sad). You could say war broke him. He tries to confide in you and be vulnerable about his struggle and you shut him down. This was immature, cruel and you need to make it right.", "At least Nick is trying. What are you doing to reach out to him? \n\nYou aren\u2019t a baby anymore op. As an adult you are now at least half responsible for the relationships in your life. Start putting some effort in or admit the problem is at least partly you. YWBTAH if you don\u2019t grow up.", "YTA\n\n#number 1 cause of death for US veterans is suicide. \nYou aren\u2019t helping. At all.", "YTA.\n\nYour brother was making an effort to bond with you and explaining why he hadn\u2019t before. You dismissed his trauma because you\u2019re sick of hearing about it? Imagine how he must feel\u2026..he has to live with it. What you said was cold and cruel for what? Bragging rights? An ego boost???", "YTA\n\npersonally not a fan of the military and how it preys on underprivileged communities BUT he is a person, with PTSD and experienced some terrible shit. And you have the gall to say you don\u2019t care when he\u2019s trying to open up about something that deeply affects him?\nI don\u2019t care if you had to hear how much he went through when growing up, this is some big traumatic shit and these are his feelings we\u2019re talking about and he may not get over it", "Yes yta", "While you have valid feelings too, those could have been discussed and shared separately. Instead you made it about yourself. YTA. You may not understand him but you could at least listen.", "YTA\n\nSuper insensitive and he's said nothing wrong to you to recieve that type of energy. Not his fault that everyone talks about how he needs help and nothing is his fault thats on your family if you're tired of it, don't understand why you would take that out on him. Think to put yourself in his shoes, war aint no joke. Imagine coming back from a traumatizing experience, wishing that you were closer, and your brother tells you he doesn't care. You should apologize.", "YTA.  \n\nI understand that you've been hearing it your entire life and you're tired of it.\n\nBut. There is a reason that vets have such a high suicide and homelessness rate.\n\nYou've likely never been close because the age gap is so extreme that you're just now old enough that he can actually relate to you.", "How was your comment even necessary?\n\n\u201cI hate that we weren\u2019t closer due to my mental health issues\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that you were in the military!\u201d \n\n\nLike whether he was in the military or not I doubt y\u2019all\u2019d\u2019ve been close considering the age gap. But literally you\u2019re so weird for suddenly taking that moment of your brother wishing you were closer to bring up resentment for him needing help. \n\nYTA", "I'm a pacifist and despise the military industrial complex and have no illusuion about the military (war crimes,  high rates of domestic violence,  discrimination,  hazing,  etc) but also have nothing but sympathy for vets and those dealing with PTSD. \n\nI'm old enough to have grown up with veterens from the Korean and Vietnam wars, and both grandfathers were WW2 veterens,  one in the Pacific and one in Europe. Even years later,  the war haunted every single one of them and their behavior reflected that.\n\nWar is fucked up,  and so is what you said.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nI can\u2019t believe you said that to someone who was trying to bond and open up to you. \n\n\u201cThe guts of my friends were sprayed all over me, so I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been distant. I want to be closer to you, sorry I\u2019m struggling\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d\n\nWhat the ACTUAL FUCK is wrong with you goddam", "YTA. Clearly he was trying to open up to you and form a better relationship. Also, it seems like your family was just trying to help him process his emotions and trauma over the war. I also don\u2019t think that his trauma is his fault.", "Bro you know you fucked up when there isn\u2019t a single NTA comment", "YTA. What were you trying to achieve by telling him that?", "YTA\n\nYou basically told your brother that you don\u2019t care about a major thing that happened to him and changed his life.  That you don\u2019t care about *him*.  How could you not be an AH?", "YTA, No sugar on this one.", "Men can\u2019t even open up and share their feelings and trauma to their own brothers anymore. YTA", "YTA. If he was using his past as an excuse for doing something terrible or abusive, you might have a point. But it sounds like he was trying to apologize. And you shut him down. He probably feels more like a failure now believing he can't repair the weak relationship you have and blames himself. \n\nYou're going to have to grow up.", "YTA in your reaction which\u2019s needlessly hurtful.\n\nSo, the real question is do you understand that you are setting yourself up for same later on? Are you ok with anyone telling you same if you at any time are down and try to open up?\n\nPerhaps reflect a bit on that and if there\u2019s anything you can do differently to steer a conversation to something more mutually beneficial?", "Yes, YTA. At the end of the day, you were completely and unnecessarily dismissive of his life experience. And he was being open and vulnerable with you, and you just really did not need to go and do that to him.", "Soft YTA. He was trying to explain his side as to why you guys don't have a good relationship. Serving in the military fucks you up, even outside of deployment. Deployment really fucks you up, and he was over there for some pretty rough years. He doesn't sound like he's glorifying anything, or being a vetbro, he was expressing that his trauma is what prevented him from getting close to you.", "YTA.  Your brother opened up to you about his pain and wish that the two of you could be closer, and you responded with jealousy and throwing out a hurtful comment.  Just because you're not close doesn't mean you have the right to inflict pain onto someone who is already hurting.  Just because you can't sympathize with what your brother has been going through all these years doesn't mean you can't empathize.  You're showing jealousy where it's not warranted.  It's a shame, really, for both of you.", "YTA. Read or listen to the audible book, the body keeps score by Bessel Van der Kolk. Get an idea of how trauma can affect a person and how devastating it can be. I hope you never have a truly traumatic experience; its something I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy.

He knows he isn\u2019t perfect and would be glad to forgive you. Man up and do it, you\u2019ll be better for it.", "YTA and a very selfish one at that. Your brother was trying to connect and apologize to you and you basically told him to F off. That\u2019s you not knowing or caring (leaning towards caring) about how he has all of these invisible scars from his time overseas that he has worked through. You are old enough now to know better and to actually stop acting like the two year old he left when he went to war. PTSD is not a joke and you should be proud that he got help to become a better person. You should be embarrassed and feel like an asshole.", "Soft YTA. Your brother tried to open up to you by sharing something deeply personal. I don\u2019t think you understand how much it takes for someone to admit OUT LOUD that something they went through messed them up. I know war veterans that refuse to talk about the shit they went through even though they were clearly affected by it. He was trying to be vulnerable with you and form a relationship with you\u2026and you blew up at him. \n\nHere\u2019s why I said soft YTA: I totally get feeling frustrated when people use someone\u2019s trauma to excuse all of their actions, especially when your feelings are invalidated. You feel like you can never feel upset towards that person because they went through something terrible, and I do believe that using one\u2019s own trauma as a crutch to justify their wrongdoings is never okay. HOWEVER, it seems like your brother has put in the work to get better and overcome his trauma, as shown with him talking to you about it and trying to be there for you. It also sounds like it was everyone else but your brother using his trauma as justification for whatever it is he has done. If there\u2019s anyone you should be angry at, it\u2019s them. Talk to them about how you feel! \n\nForming relationships with people who have gone through traumatic experiences is never easy, and tbh it sounds like the two of you could use someone to mediate your discussions because I think it\u2019s important you talk about this instead of letting it fester. Talk to a therapist individually as well because it sounds like you have some feelings of resentment already. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you can develop a healthy relationship with your brother if you so choose :)", "YTA. I understand you were 2 when he left so have no reference for him before he left, but your lack of empathy now at 21 is incredibly concerning. \nHe did a tour of combat at an incredibly young and impressionable age. He most likely has PTSD at the very least and probably some other trauma that goes unseen. The military teaches soldiers not to seek help, not to show emotion, not to trust anyone and then when they leave the military they teach them nothing about how to function in society again. \nI am all for people being accountable and owning their mistakes regardless because we are all in control of our own actions but I also think there needs to be real understanding of what leads to those actions. I am incredibly impressed that your brother chose to open up and offer his feelings to you because that\u2019s not easy to do in normal circumstances. I could respect you telling him you aren\u2019t ready or wanting to build a deeper relationship at this time but you just basically told him to Eff off and his perspective isn\u2019t valid to you. Please reevaluate your feelings. It sounds like you resent your parents or other adults and are now taking it out on your brother. \n\nMy experience: dating someone who did two tours in Afghanistan", "YTA. Major AH.", "YTA. I hope your response was due to either immaturity or ignorance, and not that you are just a cold person. I mean this sincerely.", "On Xmas?! Come on. \n\nYTA\n\nThe holidays are all about extended family and how everyone wishes the circumstances were different. Can't u pretend there's a rainbow for ONE DAY OUT OF THE WHOLE YEAR? Idk maybe one day you'll feel emotional enough to agree. And several after that you'll have an idea for a solution.", "Wow, YTA, you have no idea how the soldiers suffered over there and he came back with issues that are not his fault. My little brother went to Iraq in 2002 and came back completely messed up. He saw his fellow soldiers get blown up in front of him and saw Iraqi soldiers shoot a school full of children while the kids mom begged the American soldiers to do something. They were commanded to stand down since the violence wasn't directed at the soldiers. For you to say something like that is beyond cruel. If you had to watch friends blown up in front of you and other horrors of war, it would change you as well. Maybe you wouldn't be TA if you took the time to find out what soldiers go through in war and show some compassion. They wake up screaming from the dreams they have. You absolutely need to apologize and learn empathy and compassion.", "YTA.  You sound like a selfish prick.", "Yikes OP.  He was reaching out and you basically shit on him.  YTA and he deserves an apology.", "YTA but it's fixable if you take action now.  \n\n\nCall your brother up and apologize, tell him you fucked up and realize he was trying to open up to you to create a better bond. Tell him you realize that the war messed him up, that's what war does, and then explain how one of the side effects was everyone around you trying to compensate for its effects on him but in doing so you felt alienated by them and being young and stupid blamed him for it rather than addressing your feelings with the people you felt where neglecting you... then go from there.", "YTA\n\nBeing in the military doesn't qualify someone for sainthood but... It sounds like he was trying to build/repair a relationship with you and you just shut him down", "YTA so hard, so so hard", "YTA\nThat was really harsh and cruel.", "YTA- Have a little empathy man. I've had more empathy for strangers than you showed your brother. He suffered something traumatic, then came back to a country that does not give a shit about his mental health or well-being. Have a fucking heart.", "YTA, but it's understandable that you can't relate to your brother's experience and are tired of the impact it's had on your family. At this point, you've given up hope of ever having a relationship that doesn't revolve around his trauma. Since you were only a child when he left, you had no comprehension of what was going on, and couldn't begin to understand your brother's mental health issues when he returned home.\n\nNone of that is your fault, and it's understandable you would just give up and resign yourself to never having a close relationship with him. Becoming indifferent was a way to protect yourself from the ongoing turmoil caused by his seemingly intractable mental health issues.\n\nIt was cruel to unload your pent-up feelings of resentment on him, considering he was trying to reach out to you. Unfair as it is, you're not going to get much sympathy from other family members in this situation. If you don't want this to be the end of the story, you will need to sit down with your brother, apologize and have a heart-to-heart conversation with him about how you'd like your relationship to be in the future.\n\nIf you could shift the focus to how you want things to be in the present and future, instead of dwelling so much in the past, there might be a ray of hope. You both still have a future ahead and it's full of possibility, if you open your eyes to it.\n\nIt might really help to get a professional counselor involved, someone who has experience and knows how to deal with situations like yours. There's help out there, if you're willing to try.", "Oof, this one\u2019s bad. YTA, I can\u2019t believe you have so little empathy for your brother. Not because of your/his past, simply because he\u2019s a human sharing some heavy stuff with you.", "Definitely YTA", "War changes people. I don\u2019t mean they just get a little jumpy at fireworks either. I watched someone very close to me go to war more than once and he came back a different person every time. It\u2019s hard on everyone. \n\nThere has been a very large part of most peoples  lives, and your entire life for that matter, where the US has been at war. Knowing someone who fought in the wars has been normalized. People often forget that war isn\u2019t normal. \n\nDepending  on what he saw and dealt with it may have been really hard for him to bond with you being so young and innocent. He may have felt he wasn\u2019t good enough to be in your life, that he was damaged goods. \n\nYour feelings about him not being in your life are valid and understandable even. However the way you invalidated his feelings when he tried to apologize to you and extend an olive branch to build a relationship now sucks. \n\nHurt people hurt people, and there\u2019s obviously hurt and regret on both sides. That takes time to fix and work through, and that\u2019s ok. Being rude and dismissive isn\u2019t. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  PTSD ruins lives, completely breaks people, and destroys relationships.

Nobody joins simply to protect their country. There was no effort made to have a relationship with you up until now. On top of that you were put second by the people around you your entire life for someone that is a stranger to you. This isnt his fault but you have the right to be resentful.

That includes a sibling relationship. This being said, you could have had more tact. The way you told him was a bit cruel but you had every right to respond that way.

Real, human, flesh and blood people. No doubt he went into dangerous combat zones, where he was on high alert 24/7 and was shot at and at risk of stepping on land mines. He may have seen his friends killed, may have watched them get blown to bits or scream in agony as their legs were suddenly not there anymore. Maybe he has to look his victims in the eye and realize that, \"oh shit, this is a person. This could be me.\" His trauma was absolutely not his fault, and he was at high risk of killing himself when he came back.\n\nThere is also virtually no help for soldiers once they come back. So yes, he needed lots of help for his trauma.  At the same time, you were, I assume, neglected. That is NOT his fault. That is the fault of your parents, and I'm sure they struggled with how to give you both the attention you needed but that is ultimately on them and not you or your brother. It sounds like he really does love you and deeply regrets not being more in your life; something that happened because of his trauma and the struggle of unpacking it and getting help. If you really don't care to have a relationship with him, that is entirely valid.\n\nBut I'd suggest having a sit down with your brother and laying it all out honestly but kindly how you feel and give him the chance to explain his side and listen with empathy.

One partner we worked with the VA intensely for 3.5 years. One inpatient director was very insightful. They approach veterans with PTSD with the perspective that PTSD is a \u201cco-morbid\u201d mental health issue. Meaning, people don\u2019t develop it unless they have a primary issue. This triggered me to work hard on myself as I have ptsd from domestic violence. It fueled me to push hard to have proper diagnoses and treatment for complex physical health issues. I was actually the one to be diagnosed with a complex genetic neuromuscular disease that generations before me self medicated to mask. So basically, I\u2019m looking at this from several perspectives. One thing rarely spoken about outside of closed doors is that every military branch uses complex fielding and training techniques. They can take a young person on a toxic path and push them towards a sense of purpose and success. BUT there is a consistent population of veterans that resign themselves to having a victim mentality. These people struggle in complex ways, including interpersonal relationships. Truly, even some service members that are successful for decades in service and civilian work still carry the same psych issues they always would have had effecting their families. \nWhat you could do it sit down with him again during a time that isn\u2019t the holidays and clarify your thoughts\u2026which you need to process more. I think you spoke from a place of truth but may need to dig deeper into the meaning. You touched on the age difference. He may not know what it feels like to be the younger sibling. Maybe express to him that in your experience you\u2019ve never known a form of him that wasn\u2019t who he is as effected by his service time. Thank him for being open about his place in your relationships and compassionately ask if you can share your view point. You\u2019re not in your best when communicating from a place of hurt, and I sounds like you are both coming from that place. If you didn\u2019t care about who he is in your life you would have just remained level headed. The way you answered kinda sounds like your inner child saying you have the same blood in your veins and don\u2019t see him as the product of war but as your brother you want to be closer to. Even if you don\u2019t want to be closer to him, we owe it to family to be sincere when they express love towards us. \nMy siblings have a similar age gap and my BIL whom was very high rank Army just died in October. Whether we agree with the military complex or not there is a reverence we need to have for service people for risking their lives as they perceived for the greater good. Service connected PTSD is often caused by something different than you\u2019re able to understand as a civilian. We tend to think they killed people. But it\u2019s often because of the constant fear of being killed, realizing they were used for political agenda and now have to engaged in a society that is ignorant to the things going on in the world. They are isolated and usually have a learning disability, depression, history of child abuse, addiction or attachment issues that put them on the path to want to join the military. The drinking he was doing is likely a big reason this ick conversation happened between you. Could be an alcoholic, which goes hand in hand with depression\u2026could even be contraindicated with medications he\u2019s on for the PTSD.

He is a dead set hero, as is your brother.  You are nothing.  You are less than nothing.  You are the shit from the insect that eats the shit of rats.  AH.", "Yta but you\u2019re young so I hope one day you realize how words like this can really affect someone.", "YTA.  That's fucked up.", "YTA... no even better, you're a f'in DH", "YTA. Some countries specialize in certain things. For the US it's military industrial complex as observed by George Carlin. It's your bread and butter. You should take any amount of shit for your bread and butter.", "INFO: What do you think those who go into active combat do? What do you think they see? Do you think it's like a video game? Do you think that taking the life of a person you are at war against is any different than taking the life so someone you love? I am honestly asking, and I really hope you will answer one of these questions. Do you understand not only what PTSD is, but why it's something soldiers deal with? Do you think it's not traumatizing them because they are \"fighting an enemy?\" \n\nAlso, what situations have happened that made you feel like all the attention was put on him, for what I'm guessing is you feeling like he just wanted to be the center of attention? Is there a specific time you are willing to share?\n\nDo you feel like he abandoned you? During the time he was gone did something happen to you that you think wouldn't have if he had been there to be your older brother and protect you?\n\nIn other words....why don't you care, exactly why do you not care?\n\nA lot of people, if not all, are saying y t a, and are incredibly mad for how insensitive you come off. I am saving judgement, and there is no anger here. I am.just curious on what things specifically happened to make you feel this way. I don't need to hear every instance, every story, but a few to explain instead of giving broad statements.\n\nI don't support the wars, I don't support the military. I do however support soldiers. They go and do so much, and it's so much more traumatic than you may understand. I get mad for/with the soldiers about the things they are trained to do, the reasons they are told they have to do it. How the belief in what they signed up for and the reality of what happens is not the same. How the military steals their intent. \n\nIt's so unbelievably complicated, the mental and emotional trauma doesn't just come from the things they do and see. The guilt on so many levels. These are traumas that are never cured, these are traumas that are barely and rarely treated. The \"lucky\" few learn how to survive with it, so that they can continue on with life and happiness the best of their ability. But these demons they encounter, attach themselves to soldiers and they stay with them like shadows. Soldiers will never be free of them. They can just change the angle of the light and make them smaller, less noticeable, but those shadows are still there, and all it takes is something as simple as a turn for those shadows to grow big. \n\nWhy did you put quotes around \"messed him up really bad?\" Is it because that was a quote, or is it because you don't believe it? Your brother was trying to open up to you. Him being a little drunk probably allowed him to do that. He was trying to tell you something, share something with you, that he has never been able to say to you, if he has ever even said it to himself. The guilt about not having the relationship he wishes you had, about how he may have even noticed that he took attention away from you (he didn't do it on purpose) probably eats him up more than you are allowing him to tell you, and yourself to hear. \n\nIt's ok and understandable to be mad at him, it's ok to hurt and it's ok to feel like his time in the military took him away from you, took the relationship you should have had with him away from you.It wasn't done on purpose, it wasn't done to hurt you. It's one of those things that happens when someone you love becomes a soldier. It's like being a caretaker to someone with a terminal disease. The person with the disease gets the help and attention because they are the ones in need. But being a caretaker is just as hard and takes a huge toll, and they are very often overlooked. Many people on the outside will act like they are not affected because they are not the ones who are sick. But they are affected, they too take a hit. It's not ok for a caretaker to take it out on the one they are caring for, it's not ok for others to tell and act like the caretaker shouldn't matter either. Just like it's not ok for you to take your hurt and anger out on your brother, it's also not ok for your parents to tell you it's wrong to feel the way you do. Your SIL is b3ing your brothers caretaker, she's defending him when he cannot defend himself. If he was to defend himself against you, it would add to all the negative he's already feeling.\n\nIt's ok for you to feel like you do it not ok for how you acted and how you said things. I would really like if you would answer at least some of the questions I asked (you are also more than welcome to pm me), but at the very least you need to ask yourself, and be honest with yourself with the answers. You need to apologize to your brother at the very least (you should apologize to SIL also) then, you should ask your brother if the two of you, just the two of you can spend some time together and talk. Open up to him and tell him how and why you feel the way you do. But make sure he has equal time to tell you the same. I want to be mad at you also (just like the rest of reddit) for how you acted. I'm having a hard time because even through text, I can feel the pain. Even if this is a bs fake post just to get people riled up, I know there are people who feel that way, and that pain comes through. War is not fair on anyone, and no matter how not involved you are in it....we are all involved in it and it hurts everyone more than loosing livew", "Wow HARD YTA and I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't be ??

Do you have any empathy ? Who cares that you don't remember him being in Irak, I was not about you ?? He was trying to discuss with you and you was just mean.\n\nI think you need to apologize to him.", "NTA if you sign up to kill people for your government that is on you. Its a no win scenario. Dont drag your family into it.", "INFO Did you mean \"I don't care\" as in \"it doesn't matter to me that you went off to war, I would still like to get to know you even if your trauma makes you hesitant\"? Or did you mean \"I don't care\" as in \"you and your struggles mean nothing to me\"?\n\nCause, you know, big difference. If it was the former, I'd recommend clarification and an apology, since it seems like your brother (and many commenters) took it as the latter.", "I\u2019m going to b an oddball here. ESH my husband served and did three tours in Iraq. He started withdrawing from me and our kids due to PTSD. He put off seeking any kind of help due the sigma of soldiers w PTSD. He nearly destroyed his own family. It\u2019s been over a decade since he got out of service, and we\u2019re still dealing with repercussions of his refusal to get help, the angry outbursts, and our mental health as well. That being said, I have every sympathy for my husband, and I know the mental and emotional torment he goes through. I spent so much time researching PTSD and the effects, I contacted other spouses dealing with similar situations. My heart absolutely broke for him. You\u2019re absolutely allowed to be angry, but also have kindness. Sit down and talk to him. You\u2019re both adults, and you can do some research beforehand to familiarize yourself with PTSD. Also look up survivor\u2019s guilt, it\u2019s a huge factor as well for many military veterans. That being said, your feelings are absolutely valid. I still hurt from his actions, there\u2019s still a ton of things we deal with daily. Our children have a difficult relationship with him, but we all try. Every. Single. One of us. You can have a great relationship, but you have to have some empathy. I hope this helps OP.", "YTA.  Poor Nick was trying to open up to you, and you shut him down with your seemingly callous attitude.  You should get to know some veterans; perhaps that might change your attitude.\n\n(FYI, I am the daughter of a Navy Seabee, and the wife of a man who served in the Air Force, so when I see someone take such a callous attitude towards veterans, I get furious)", "YTA. My dad did 3 tours in Vietnam. My friend Annie served in the first gulf war. Both of them were Marine Corps. Getting a combat vet to open up is an act of trust. We, as civilians, simply don\u2019t have the capacity to understand what they went through. The fact that he tried to open up at all means a lot and you shut him down.

Coming from a military veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I would be beyond pissed if my sibling said something like that to me. Your brother was trying to breach the gap between the two of you and you responded like a jealous brat during Christmas. Until you can walk in his shoes and experience all of the crap that happens to you and your fellow brothers and sisters in a foreign country where you have no idea who wants to kill you is when you have the right to downplay everything he has gone through. Have some compassion and educate yourself about what he went through, maybe then you will get over yourself being a dismissive jealous brat.", "NTA. That's a pretty bad excuse for not being a brother to you. \"The war messed me up pretty bad\"?. I served several tours of duty too. I've seen some truly horrifying things,but i never let it change me.", "YTA.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you think you could possibly not be.\n\nYou sound jealous and that you believe your brother gets special treatment. Chances are, he does, and he needs it. PTSD is a real disease.", "NTA your brother chose to kill people when he didn't have to. It's not like he was defending his homeland from invaders.", "Not mention,  the suicide rate for veterans at Christmas is through the roof. A friend of mine is the only living platoon member left!\n\nEdit to add: I bet OP doesn't even know why people like his brother are willing to serve in the first place.  \n\nThe lack of respect shown our military today says a lot of people don't know either.", "All of that is true and if OP is trying to create a more differentiated perspective, then tapping into his empathy for his brother is definitely important - **HOWEVER** - and this is the critical part everyone in this comment section is missing (*glorification of the military anyone?*) is that his brother **knowingly signed up to potentially fight in a war** (someone compared this situation to not having empathy for a rape victim and **Wtf?**) He knew what the military does, the risks, the long term effects on his health and that he was realistically putting his life on the line and in the 20 years since then has used the trauma he knew he would endure as an excuse to OP for why OP never had a real brother, when that isn't the real reason. Nobody is at fault for having trauma but it's our own responsibility to get help, so we don't hurt others as a consequence of our wounds. If the brother took some accountability for not doing the work to be able to be a brother, a real apology would've went like this: \"I endured foreseeable trauma 20 years ago and I was too ashamed to get professional help but that's what I should've done because I want to be able to have a real relationship with you.\"\n\nOP is rightfully pissed that the brother pretends like how everything went down for TWO DECADES was totally out of his control and is now trying to pity party his way into a relationship he didn't invest in at all.", "I think it depends. It sounds like Nick may have done some things in the last 20 years which hurt OP. If that's the case, OP didn't handle this well but OP has no obligation to open up or sweep everything under the rug.\n\nAgain, OP really should have more empathy but read this again:\n\n>Honestly my whole life I\u2019ve been hearing about how Nick needed help or nothing was nicks fault.\n\nRemember OP would have just being born around 2003. Did Nick have addiction issues? Was Nick violent? Did OP have to go without because parents were covering for Nick?\n\nNick should have never had to go to war in 2003, so I'm not trashing Nick here. Nick never should have experienced that. But if Nick's actions really hurt OP, it's understandable that OP maybe isn't ready to open up himself.", "I cant agree with you.

First of all OP obviously never said anything like this before, otherwise his brother wouldn't have been so surprised by his response. So no, OP got *nothing* to do with veterans not seeking help. That conclusion is on you. Second of all OP is fully entitled to his feelings, and if you read all of his story maybe you would understand why. He was let down as a kid because of his brother's needs. What if this had happened to your husband's baby brother? Wouldn't you feel the least sorry for that kid who never got his parents' attention? \n\nI'm going through a lot of trauma myself. That doesn't mean other people are not entitled to their feelings. We all struggle with something. You and your husband struggle with so much more than most of us do but that doesn't change the fact that OP was let down as a child. Like it or not it really makes sense that he doesn't care about his brother because they've never been close and even more important he's feeling that his brother's needs were the reason his parents couldn't be there for him. Every child needs their parents' attention, I'm sure you don't disagree with that. Personally I don't care about my parents because they let me down during all of my childhood. If one of my siblings had been the reason they let me down I'm sure I would have been holding a grudge towards that sibling and therefore wouldn't have cared about them either.\n\nPeeps, you can downvote me all you want, I really don't care about votes, especially not in this community where most people seem to let their emotions guide them. If you all stop for a second and think about it it really doesn't make any sense that a burnt child should be responsible for veterans not seeking help.", "You know the irony here in telling OP that his feelings  don't matter because his brother served, means that your feelings don't matter because you DIDN'T serve. Like, you're reinforcing OPs hatred towards his brother by cussing him out and telling him that his brother's feelings matter more.
