Your brother was trying to open up to you and your response was to say \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d His experiences were traumatizing, and though you may not care about his being in the military you should care about the impact it had on him. Not because he\u2019s your brother, but because he\u2019s a human being that lives through horrible traumatic experiences.", "YTA \n\nI was with you until the end. He was telling you he wished you were closer and you essentially said you don\u2019t care.", "YTA. He opened up and was trying to reach out to you and you basically threw it in his face by using the experience that he is most fragile about to hurt him. You completely lack any compassion or empathy and you did it out of spite and jealousy because you think he got more attention than  you did. You're 21 not 12 grow the hell up.", "YTA. What\u2019s wrong with you?? He fights in a war and you basically say you dont care about your sibling relationship or the fact he fought in a war? Then you make him cry about it all??? YTA heavy on YTA.\n\nIf you were frustrated that \u201ceverything was about him\u201d all the time that isnt his fault. That\u2019s the fault of everyone lacking to show you some attention growing up, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to basically say \u201cI dont really give two sh*ts about you and your life\u201d to him.", "YTA Firstly, you seem to lack any empathy whatsoever for Nick. Your brother was clearly trying to work on your relationship and bond with you. Your response about not caring about the fact he went to war, which clearly had a major impact on both him and his mental health, was just cruel.\n\nUnlike you, your brother is actually trying to fix your relationship. And you're going out of your way to push him away. Also, there is a MASSIVE age gap here, which I'm confident plays a huge factor in why you two were never close to begin with. He was already an adult by the time you were born.\n\nEither way, would it kill you to have a little compassion?", "YTA\n\nWow.... You really need to watch a few documentaries on what the men and women went through over there. Not just there. In Vietnam, Korea, WWII, and WWI. You really have no clue. It's quite clear as you (multiple times) make it seem like it's no big deal and how everyone is just coddling your brother. What's worse is that your brother was trying to open up to you. This was him trying start a relationship with you.", "YTA\n\nBeing in the military is a struggle, much less being in a war. Everything being about Nick isn't really Nick's fault, but the people who make it about him (e.g parents). It's fine to not be close to a sibling but you should let him know whether or not you want a relationship with him or not.", "YTA. I agree that military idolization is played too often. But the mental impact of time served is real. And if you want a relationship with him, you will need to accept that his issues from service are a part of who he is now. Be his support the best you can (while still enforcing your own boundaries, if needed). Encourage him to seek professional help.", "YTA he confided in you about experiencing trauma while serving and you said that you didn\u2019t care. He wants to have a relationship with you and you hurt him for no reason. Why?! You made him cry. He probably has PTSD or depression or both! And it does matter. That was ignorant and nasty.\n\nHe wants to be friends!", "YTA. Do some research on PTSD and try having some empathy for your brother.", "So\u2026your brother made himself vulnerable to you, expressed his sorrow that his PTSD and other war-related traumas made it hard to build a relationship with you and you\u2026told him that you didn\u2019t care because you grew up in a family dealing with the return of a traumatized soldier.\n\nYTA, and incredibly self-centered. Yes, having a relative with special needs can be exhausting but at your age, you should have either dealt with it or sought therapy to get help dealing with it.", "YTA, because even if he was not your brother, even forgetting he had PTSD from being in the military, he's a guy who's trying to open up to another guy, and that about his mental issues, and to to be told bluntly \"I don't care\" is the worst a man can face from another.  Men need to be more empathetic to other men, period.\n\nYou can hide behind your young age, or that you feel he hogged some of your limelight, but you are only coming off as a major pissant.  The military as a system is just an exploitative institution, but the people it crushes are real, and you being a jerk to one of them is major Aholery", "If you were to take out the fact that he served in the Military during war time. A person who never caused you harm apologizes that they could not be closer to you and you dumped all over him. What does that make you?", "Spoken like a kid. Yta", "YTA. Look, I\u2019m not super rah rah military. I don\u2019t think military service should be elevated above all other possible kinds of service, which seems like something a lot of people in our country do. And I don\u2019t necessarily think military trauma should be treated as more special than any other possible trauma. But what you said would be rude and hurtful no matter what his trauma was. \n\nLike take literally any other traumatic life event and imagine saying what you said. This is something that affected your brothers entire life. It messed him up really bad. And of COURSE therefore it affected his relationship with you. And you said \u201cI don\u2019t care that this happened to you.\u201d  This translates to \u201cI don\u2019t care about you.\u201d", "Let\u2019s imagine that you are in a car accident.   You spend two years in the hospital recovering (yes, that can happen) and after that you still have about ten years\u2019 worth of physiotherapy to deal with before you can walk normally again.\n\nImagine if you went through all that.   Then you apologised to your dad, a person you love, because you haven\u2019t been able to play sports with him all this time.\n\nYour dad says, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your car accident or how badly hurt you were.   It\u2019s your fault that you weren\u2019t around on game days, and I am never going to forgive you for that.\u201d\n\nWould that be fair?  Would your dad be an asshole for treating you like that?\n\nTry to grow some compassion before something happens and *you* end up needing compassion yourself.   I guarantee that it will happen before the end.  No one gets through life unscathed.  YTA.", "YTA. It changed him as a person and was a massive time in his life and you said you don't care.", "YTA. He was obviously trying to connect with you. Just because *you* don't remember the Iraq war doesn't mean it wasn't significant to your brother, and consequently impacted his personality and how he has related to you. Please educate yourself about PTSD and the long lasting impact of combat on those who have served. You were terribly insensitive to a person when they were in a vulnerable space.", "YTA. Oh boy you are TA. He served his country during a war and suffered major psychological trauma (Which is very common and really sad). You could say war broke him. He tries to confide in you and be vulnerable about his struggle and you shut him down. This was immature, cruel and you need to make it right.", "At least Nick is trying. What are you doing to reach out to him? \n\nYou aren\u2019t a baby anymore op. As an adult you are now at least half responsible for the relationships in your life. Start putting some effort in or admit the problem is at least partly you. YWBTAH if you don\u2019t grow up.", "YTA\n\n#number 1 cause of death for US veterans is suicide. \nYou aren\u2019t helping. At all.", "YTA.\n\nYour brother was making an effort to bond with you and explaining why he hadn\u2019t before. You dismissed his trauma because you\u2019re sick of hearing about it? Imagine how he must feel\u2026..he has to live with it. What you said was cold and cruel for what? Bragging rights? An ego boost???", "YTA\n\npersonally not a fan of the military and how it preys on underprivileged communities BUT he is a person, with PTSD and experienced some terrible shit. And you have the gall to say you don\u2019t care when he\u2019s trying to open up about something that deeply affects him?\nI don\u2019t care if you had to hear how much he went through when growing up, this is some big traumatic shit and these are his feelings we\u2019re talking about and he may not get over it", "Yes yta", "While you have valid feelings too, those could have been discussed and shared separately. Instead you made it about yourself. YTA. You may not understand him but you could at least listen.", "YTA\n\nSuper insensitive and he's said nothing wrong to you to recieve that type of energy. Not his fault that everyone talks about how he needs help and nothing is his fault thats on your family if you're tired of it, don't understand why you would take that out on him. Think to put yourself in his shoes, war aint no joke. Imagine coming back from a traumatizing experience, wishing that you were closer, and your brother tells you he doesn't care. You should apologize.", "YTA.  \n\nI understand that you've been hearing it your entire life and you're tired of it.\n\nBut. There is a reason that vets have such a high suicide and homelessness rate.\n\nYou've likely never been close because the age gap is so extreme that you're just now old enough that he can actually relate to you.", "How was your comment even necessary?\n\n\u201cI hate that we weren\u2019t closer due to my mental health issues\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that you were in the military!\u201d \n\n\nLike whether he was in the military or not I doubt y\u2019all\u2019d\u2019ve been close considering the age gap. But literally you\u2019re so weird for suddenly taking that moment of your brother wishing you were closer to bring up resentment for him needing help. \n\nYTA", "I'm a pacifist and despise the military industrial complex and have no illusuion about the military (war crimes,  high rates of domestic violence,  discrimination,  hazing,  etc) but also have nothing but sympathy for vets and those dealing with PTSD. \n\nI'm old enough to have grown up with veterens from the Korean and Vietnam wars, and both grandfathers were WW2 veterens,  one in the Pacific and one in Europe. Even years later,  the war haunted every single one of them and their behavior reflected that.\n\nWar is fucked up,  and so is what you said.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nI can\u2019t believe you said that to someone who was trying to bond and open up to you. \n\n\u201cThe guts of my friends were sprayed all over me, so I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been distant. I want to be closer to you, sorry I\u2019m struggling\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d\n\nWhat the ACTUAL FUCK is wrong with you goddam", "YTA. Clearly he was trying to open up to you and form a better relationship. Also, it seems like your family was just trying to help him process his emotions and trauma over the war. I also don\u2019t think that his trauma is his fault.", "Bro you know you fucked up when there isn\u2019t a single NTA comment", "YTA. What were you trying to achieve by telling him that?", "YTA\n\nYou basically told your brother that you don\u2019t care about a major thing that happened to him and changed his life.  That you don\u2019t care about *him*.  How could you not be an AH?", "YTA, No sugar on this one.", "Men can\u2019t even open up and share their feelings and trauma to their own brothers anymore. YTA", "YTA. If he was using his past as an excuse for doing something terrible or abusive, you might have a point. But it sounds like he was trying to apologize. And you shut him down. He probably feels more like a failure now believing he can't repair the weak relationship you have and blames himself. \n\nYou're going to have to grow up.", "YTA in your reaction which\u2019s needlessly hurtful.\n\nSo, the real question is do you understand that you are setting yourself up for same later on? Are you ok with anyone telling you same if you at any time are down and try to open up?\n\nPerhaps reflect a bit on that and if there\u2019s anything you can do differently to steer a conversation to something more mutually beneficial?", "Yes, YTA. At the end of the day, you were completely and unnecessarily dismissive of his life experience. And he was being open and vulnerable with you, and you just really did not need to go and do that to him.", "Soft YTA. He was trying to explain his side as to why you guys don't have a good relationship. Serving in the military fucks you up, even outside of deployment. Deployment really fucks you up, and he was over there for some pretty rough years. He doesn't sound like he's glorifying anything, or being a vetbro, he was expressing that his trauma is what prevented him from getting close to you.", "YTA.  Your brother opened up to you about his pain and wish that the two of you could be closer, and you responded with jealousy and throwing out a hurtful comment.  Just because you're not close doesn't mean you have the right to inflict pain onto someone who is already hurting.  Just because you can't sympathize with what your brother has been going through all these years doesn't mean you can't empathize.  You're showing jealousy where it's not warranted.  It's a shame, really, for both of you.", "YTA. Read or listen to the audible book, the body keeps score by Bessel Van der Kolk. Get an idea of how trauma can affect a person and how devastating it can be. I hope you never have a truly traumatic experience; its something I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy.

He knows he isn\u2019t perfect and would be glad to forgive you. Man up and do it, you\u2019ll be better for it.", "YTA and a very selfish one at that. Your brother was trying to connect and apologize to you and you basically told him to F off. That\u2019s you not knowing or caring (leaning towards caring) about how he has all of these invisible scars from his time overseas that he has worked through. You are old enough now to know better and to actually stop acting like the two year old he left when he went to war. PTSD is not a joke and you should be proud that he got help to become a better person. You should be embarrassed and feel like an asshole.", "Soft YTA. Your brother tried to open up to you by sharing something deeply personal. I don\u2019t think you understand how much it takes for someone to admit OUT LOUD that something they went through messed them up. I know war veterans that refuse to talk about the shit they went through even though they were clearly affected by it. He was trying to be vulnerable with you and form a relationship with you\u2026and you blew up at him. \n\nHere\u2019s why I said soft YTA: I totally get feeling frustrated when people use someone\u2019s trauma to excuse all of their actions, especially when your feelings are invalidated. You feel like you can never feel upset towards that person because they went through something terrible, and I do believe that using one\u2019s own trauma as a crutch to justify their wrongdoings is never okay. HOWEVER, it seems like your brother has put in the work to get better and overcome his trauma, as shown with him talking to you about it and trying to be there for you. It also sounds like it was everyone else but your brother using his trauma as justification for whatever it is he has done. If there\u2019s anyone you should be angry at, it\u2019s them. Talk to them about how you feel! \n\nForming relationships with people who have gone through traumatic experiences is never easy, and tbh it sounds like the two of you could use someone to mediate your discussions because I think it\u2019s important you talk about this instead of letting it fester. Talk to a therapist individually as well because it sounds like you have some feelings of resentment already. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you can develop a healthy relationship with your brother if you so choose :)", "YTA. I understand you were 2 when he left so have no reference for him before he left, but your lack of empathy now at 21 is incredibly concerning. \nHe did a tour of combat at an incredibly young and impressionable age. He most likely has PTSD at the very least and probably some other trauma that goes unseen. The military teaches soldiers not to seek help, not to show emotion, not to trust anyone and then when they leave the military they teach them nothing about how to function in society again. \nI am all for people being accountable and owning their mistakes regardless because we are all in control of our own actions but I also think there needs to be real understanding of what leads to those actions. I am incredibly impressed that your brother chose to open up and offer his feelings to you because that\u2019s not easy to do in normal circumstances. I could respect you telling him you aren\u2019t ready or wanting to build a deeper relationship at this time but you just basically told him to Eff off and his perspective isn\u2019t valid to you. Please reevaluate your feelings. It sounds like you resent your parents or other adults and are now taking it out on your brother. \n\nMy experience: dating someone who did two tours in Afghanistan", "YTA. Major AH.", "YTA. I hope your response was due to either immaturity or ignorance, and not that you are just a cold person. I mean this sincerely.", "On Xmas?! Come on. \n\nYTA\n\nThe holidays are all about extended family and how everyone wishes the circumstances were different. Can't u pretend there's a rainbow for ONE DAY OUT OF THE WHOLE YEAR? Idk maybe one day you'll feel emotional enough to agree. And several after that you'll have an idea for a solution.", "Wow, YTA, you have no idea how the soldiers suffered over there and he came back with issues that are not his fault. My little brother went to Iraq in 2002 and came back completely messed up. He saw his fellow soldiers get blown up in front of him and saw Iraqi soldiers shoot a school full of children while the kids mom begged the American soldiers to do something. They were commanded to stand down since the violence wasn't directed at the soldiers. For you to say something like that is beyond cruel. If you had to watch friends blown up in front of you and other horrors of war, it would change you as well. Maybe you wouldn't be TA if you took the time to find out what soldiers go through in war and show some compassion. They wake up screaming from the dreams they have. You absolutely need to apologize and learn empathy and compassion.", "YTA.  You sound like a selfish prick.", "Yikes OP.  He was reaching out and you basically shit on him.  YTA and he deserves an apology.", "YTA but it's fixable if you take action now.  \n\n\nCall your brother up and apologize, tell him you fucked up and realize he was trying to open up to you to create a better bond. Tell him you realize that the war messed him up, that's what war does, and then explain how one of the side effects was everyone around you trying to compensate for its effects on him but in doing so you felt alienated by them and being young and stupid blamed him for it rather than addressing your feelings with the people you felt where neglecting you... then go from there.", "YTA\n\nBeing in the military doesn't qualify someone for sainthood but... It sounds like he was trying to build/repair a relationship with you and you just shut him down", "YTA so hard, so so hard", "YTA\nThat was really harsh and cruel.", "YTA- Have a little empathy man. I've had more empathy for strangers than you showed your brother. He suffered something traumatic, then came back to a country that does not give a shit about his mental health or well-being. Have a fucking heart.", "YTA, but it's understandable that you can't relate to your brother's experience and are tired of the impact it's had on your family. At this point, you've given up hope of ever having a relationship that doesn't revolve around his trauma. Since you were only a child when he left, you had no comprehension of what was going on, and couldn't begin to understand your brother's mental health issues when he returned home.\n\nNone of that is your fault, and it's understandable you would just give up and resign yourself to never having a close relationship with him. Becoming indifferent was a way to protect yourself from the ongoing turmoil caused by his seemingly intractable mental health issues.\n\nIt was cruel to unload your pent-up feelings of resentment on him, considering he was trying to reach out to you. Unfair as it is, you're not going to get much sympathy from other family members in this situation. If you don't want this to be the end of the story, you will need to sit down with your brother, apologize and have a heart-to-heart conversation with him about how you'd like your relationship to be in the future.\n\nIf you could shift the focus to how you want things to be in the present and future, instead of dwelling so much in the past, there might be a ray of hope. You both still have a future ahead and it's full of possibility, if you open your eyes to it.\n\nIt might really help to get a professional counselor involved, someone who has experience and knows how to deal with situations like yours. There's help out there, if you're willing to try.", "Oof, this one\u2019s bad. YTA, I can\u2019t believe you have so little empathy for your brother. Not because of your/his past, simply because he\u2019s a human sharing some heavy stuff with you.", "Definitely YTA", "War changes people. I don\u2019t mean they just get a little jumpy at fireworks either. I watched someone very close to me go to war more than once and he came back a different person every time. It\u2019s hard on everyone. \n\nThere has been a very large part of most peoples  lives, and your entire life for that matter, where the US has been at war. Knowing someone who fought in the wars has been normalized. People often forget that war isn\u2019t normal. \n\nDepending  on what he saw and dealt with it may have been really hard for him to bond with you being so young and innocent. He may have felt he wasn\u2019t good enough to be in your life, that he was damaged goods. \n\nYour feelings about him not being in your life are valid and understandable even. However the way you invalidated his feelings when he tried to apologize to you and extend an olive branch to build a relationship now sucks. \n\nHurt people hurt people, and there\u2019s obviously hurt and regret on both sides. That takes time to fix and work through, and that\u2019s ok. Being rude and dismissive isn\u2019t. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  PTSD ruins lives, completely breaks people, and destroys relationships.  You used that against him when he was trying to open up to you.  You seem devoid of empathy here.", "YTA. All the horrors your brother must have endured (seeing women who had been ****** by the Taliban, friends of his blown to bits, the remains of young children, etc.) all that pales in comparison to the cold heartedness you\u2019ve shown yourself capable of. You are a monster in human skin.", "YTA, YTA, YTA! No other answer is required...but get your head out of your a** you selfish little pr*ck. Why don't you join the military?? You literally have no I what he's been through.", "YTA. Damn you're cold.", "NTA", "YTA. Your brother was trying to open up to you and you just ... dismissed him? You say you're not close to him and yet when he attempts to bond with you you blow him off like he's nothing. \n\nWar is not fun. It is not a video game you can just turn off with a click. War leaves scars, both emotional and physical. And you don't care. \n\nWay to go, kid. Go contemplate your selfishness.", "YTA", ">My (21M) older brother (Nick 39M) went overseas in 2003 and served in the Iraq war. \n\n>I obviously don\u2019t remember it as I was 2 when he left.\n\nSo you was born in 2001. The year of 9/11. You have no idea, how traumatic this alone was for, like, the whole world. Me not even being an american can understand, why so many people went to war for what they thought was protecting their relatives from more 9/11-s. For new born babies like you back than. Of course this does not excuses everything what happened after (i mean him personally, please don't start political debate here), but for god's sake, if you cannot have a bare minimum of empathy, learn to know about it.\n\nYTA, leaning to N A H, but you being 21yo cannot act like a teen in this matter.", "The relationship is probably better off being non existent in his case, I'd hate to be related to someone as cold as you", "WTF? Really you don\u2019t care? Well you care enough to post on here about it.

Well besides this issue obviously.  It\u2019s ok to be mad that you didn\u2019t get enough hugs, but that wasn\u2019t Nicks fault. It\u2019s your parents and everyone else who forgot about you.
