One of her daughters [13f] spent a couple hours watching old episodes of The Crocodile hunter on a TV.\n\nMy friend said her daughter's been pretty interested in animals and wildlife and nature so they got her some of those to watch, since she remembers enjoying those shows as a kid and the modern versions of them don't seem as good.\n\nI thought this was great as I actually grew up near Beerwah, Australia (where the Australia Zoo is) and we went a lot - even into my young adulthood before moving to the US for work. Got to see Steve a couple times, and later Bindi when she got older, at a couple talks / small group settings. My friend said \"wow, you should totally tell my daughter about that!\"\n\nSo a while later I went into the living room where the daughter was watching the shows, and I told her \"I got to see Steve a couple times before he died and later Bindi,\" and she got excited and started asking me a lot of questions.\n\n I told her he seemed like a great guy and as much as I could remember about the animals. Then I told her about a detail about the first \"talk\"/small-ish group I saw him at where he warned us that he had to help cover for a keeper who called in sick and cleaned out the primate houses right before this talk and hadn't showered yet, so we really might not a front row seat. I didn't listen and got one anyways, and...ooof, regretted it. I'm sure it was a great talk and a treasured memory looking back, but at the time all I could think about was how not to gag!\n\nThis horrified my friend's daughter more than I thought, as she went \"ewww he smelled bad?\" I was sorta taken aback and said \"well, what do you think, being around animals all day every day! That day was worse than others I'm sure, but come to think of it he stunk pretty bad the other time I got close enough to smell him too...so did Bindi, for that matter\"\n\nMy friend's daughter is apparently also very into spas and perfumes and smelling nice, and this has put a great damper on her thoughts of working with wildlife and even her enthusiasm for seeing it through a screen. My friend called me the next day and said \"Of all the things to share with her did you really have to bring up how Steve Irwin smelled like monkey waste when you met him and distracted you from the talk?\" She said that seemed like an inappropriate thing to bring up to a young girl and also disrespectful to Steve's memory.\n\nBut I don't think it was inappropriate to bring up, I think it's a realistic part of the work Steve did and was certainly something that stuck in my memory. If anything it made me respect the work he did more!\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687778446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jekxi/aita_for_ruining_steve_irwin_for_my_friends/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean even in the city, you WILL find dog poo soner or later and you most likely will have the accident of stepping in it.\n\nSo even in the city, you should have learned, that animals are not the type of creature, going into spas and working with them will result in some smelly situations.", "NTA this is fucking hilarious", "There are so many other ways to interact and help animals where you wouldn't always smell.\n\nNTA, she asked after all.", "It\u2019s actually super important, the whole smell thing. Because when working with WILDLIFE, you actually want to smell consistently like yourself. It\u2019s part of how a lot of animals will recognize you. And if you muddy that up with perfumes it could get you hurt or killed.\n\nNTA, if it hurt her interest, then it was good it dissipated before serious investment into it happened, and then she got smacked in the face by the scent of reality. Wild animals are amazing, and wildlife reserves and zoos are great, but someone like her might want to stick to domestic animals like cats and dogs and bunnies. Pet care is also super important and veterinary workers aren\u2019t usually expected to be mucking a zoo enclosure unless their an exotic animal vet. Lol.\n\nBut if learning that Steve smelled bad was enough to turn her interest away, than it was a passing interest at best and not a passion or something she would have pursued in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like a needed dose of reality.\n\nAlso! **Ugh.** Ape stench. It's by far not the *worst* smell I've encountered working with animals but it might somehow be my least favorite. \n\nAt least if you reek of big cat, or otter, or penguin, people will go \"oh, ugh, yep, *that's* a zookeeper alright, gasp, gag, barf.\"\n\nAfter a long day in the ape house you might not stink as *bad*, but it's in this sickening uncanny valley of smells where it's not entirely beyond the realm of possibility that it's super bad human BO. \n\nBut like, the worst ever, though. And funkier than you'd hope any human has the capability of producing. And yet you know that any stranger will have at least *some* thought in the back of their head of \"did this person just never shower in the past decade?*", "NTA she's 13 for crying out loud. This isn't Santa Claus. Her world isn't gonna end now that she knows animals can smell.", "NTA. If anything you did the little girl a favor. She thought she might grow up to work with wildlife which can take decades. Then, when they get there and realize what the work is really like and they hate it and all those years go to waste. You just helped her focus more on things she does enjoy and can now head in a direction that she will really enjoy. Mom will get over it. If you didn\u2019t change the daughter\u2019s mind, she would have done it on her own eventually.\n\nPlus, people change their mind a thousand times on what profession they really want to do for a million reasons. Mom needs to chill, but don\u2019t tell her that.", "NTA. At some point the girl will remember tour story as a funny one. And some sense of realiteit regarding keeping animals is always a good thing to teach children.", "NTA.  13 is way too old to be that delusional.", "A koala peed on  me when I was holding it at Australia Zoo. It did not smell pleasant. *I* did not smell pleasant the rest of the day. And that's just from holding one further critter for 10 minutes. My aunt worked at Healesville Sanctuary. The smell goes with the job.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t inappropriate to say a zookeeper smelled. And it\u2019s the reality of the job. She\u2019s 13 and should be able to handle knowing that. If she\u2019s put off by knowing animals stink, she shouldn\u2019t be working with wildlife anyway.", "NTA. I wish more prospective wildlife caretakers would be disillusioned by some of the VERY not-fun parts of the job at 13, instead of taking up spots in zoology programs in colleges or even internships at zoos before discovering that the work can be **horrifically** foul at times and quitting.", "NTA and your friends daughter sounds like she lacks common sense. Has she never been to a zoo at all? It\u2019s kinda stinky because animals are kinda stinky!", "NTA\n\nYou are sharing a personal experience.\n\nThe obvious Silver Lining of this cloud is that she realized animals smell before she spent a lot of time and money pursuing working with them as a career.", "NTA- you mentioned some memory that was strong that applied to the story and then questions about it. It\u2019s on the parents not to have the kids obsessed over cleanliness and smells to this extreme. A lot of life doesn\u2019t smell nice; like has this 13 yr old never taken out the trash and compost bins ?!", ">My friend's daughter is apparently also very into spas and perfumes and smelling nice\n\nINFO did you know this piece of it before your talk with her?", "NTA\n\nYou shared your experience of meeting a legend. I actually think this is an interesting fact and brings more life to the story. I have a friend who has horses and every time she gets home after riding or taking care of them she smells like a horse. It is just a fact of animal caring and nothing to hide.", "NTA. I was a big fan of the James Herriot book series growing up. One of the things I remember him talking about was instructing a group of young veterinary students as he was examining a cow \u2026 rectally. He said that watching him removing his entire (excrement covered) arm from a cow\u2019s anus is often the defining moment that separates many of the real vets from the students who can\u2019t take it. If your friend\u2019s daughter is icked out at the idea of gross things and smells, she probably likes the idea of animals more than actual animals. That\u2019s not to say that she won\u2019t ever go into an animal related field, but it\u2019s good that you introduced the idea that it won\u2019t always be clean and pretty. I don\u2019t know why your friend wanted to keep his daughter in the dark about this but better she found this out in the beginning.", "Your friend asked you to share your memories of seeing Steve Irwin with her daughter and you did. Talking about how working with animals can make you smell like them is just a fact. I think that part of the story made the anecdote more interesting. Talking about that would not \u2018ruin Steve Irwin\u2019 for most people. Who knew her daughter would fixate on that one aspect of the story? NTA.", "NTA\n\nWtf is wrong with people? Of course people working with animals will smell bad sometimes\u2026I mean, you can say he smelt normal most of the time when he hadn\u2019t been cleaning pens.\nI mean, what is the intention here? To lie to the child about it until they visit the zoo one time? Or a pet store? Absurd."]}
