Then I told her about a detail about the first \"talk\"/small-ish group I saw him at where he warned us that he had to help cover for a keeper who called in sick and cleaned out the primate houses right before this talk and hadn't showered yet, so we really might not a front row seat. I didn't listen and got one anyways, and...ooof, regretted it. I'm sure it was a great talk and a treasured memory looking back, but at the time all I could think about was how not to gag!\n\nThis horrified my friend's daughter more than I thought, as she went \"ewww he smelled bad?\" I was sorta taken aback and said \"well, what do you think, being around animals all day every day! That day was worse than others I'm sure, but come to think of it he stunk pretty bad the other time I got close enough to smell him too...so did Bindi, for that matter\"\n\nMy friend's daughter is apparently also very into spas and perfumes and smelling nice, and this has put a great damper on her thoughts of working with wildlife and even her enthusiasm for seeing it through a screen. My friend called me the next day and said \"Of all the things to share with her did you really have to bring up how Steve Irwin smelled like monkey waste when you met him and distracted you from the talk?\" She said that seemed like an inappropriate thing to bring up to a young girl and also disrespectful to Steve's memory.\n\nBut I don't think it was inappropriate to bring up, I think it's a realistic part of the work Steve did and was certainly something that stuck in my memory.

And funkier than you'd hope any human has the capability of producing. And yet you know that any stranger will have at least *some* thought in the back of their head of \"did this person just never shower in the past decade?\"", "NTA she's 13 for crying out loud. This isn't Santa Claus. Her world isn't gonna end now that she knows animals can smell.", "NTA. If anything you did the little girl a favor. She thought she might grow up to work with wildlife which can take decades. Then, when they get there and realize what the work is really like and they hate it and all those years go to waste. You just helped her focus more on things she does enjoy and can now head in a direction that she will really enjoy. Mom will get over it. If you didn\u2019t change the daughter\u2019s mind, she would have done it on her own eventually.\n\nPlus, people change their mind a thousand times on what profession they really want to do for a million reasons. Mom needs to chill, but don\u2019t tell her that.", "NTA. At some point the girl will remember tour story as a funny one. And some sense of realiteit regarding keeping animals is always a good thing to teach children.", "NTA.  13 is way too old to be that delusional.", "A koala peed on  me when I was holding it at Australia Zoo. It did not smell pleasant. *I* did not smell pleasant the rest of the day. And that's just from holding one further critter for 10 minutes. My aunt worked at Healesville Sanctuary. The smell goes with the job.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t inappropriate to say a zookeeper smelled. And it\u2019s the reality of the job. She\u2019s 13 and should be able to handle knowing that. If she\u2019s put off by knowing animals stink, she shouldn\u2019t be working with wildlife anyway.", "NTA. I wish more prospective wildlife caretakers would be disillusioned by some of the VERY not-fun parts of the job at 13, instead of taking up spots in zoology programs in colleges or even internships at zoos before discovering that the work can be **horrifically** foul at times and quitting.", "NTA and your friends daughter sounds like she lacks common sense. Has she never been to a zoo at all? It\u2019s kinda stinky because animals are kinda stinky!", "NTA\n\nYou are sharing a personal experience.\n\nThe obvious Silver Lining of this cloud is that she realized animals smell before she spent a lot of time and money pursuing working with them as a career.", "NTA- you mentioned some memory that was strong that applied to the story and then questions about it. It\u2019s on the parents not to have the kids obsessed over cleanliness and smells to this extreme. A lot of life doesn\u2019t smell nice; like has this 13 yr old never taken out the trash and compost bins ?!", ">My friend's daughter is apparently also very into spas and perfumes and smelling nice\n\nINFO did you know this piece of it before your talk with her?      \n     \n(Edit: to be clear, I think at worst this is E S H. The mom may have wanted to break that type of disappointing aspect to her daughter herself, but it doesn't mean she should have gotten upset with OP or called it inappropriate. If OP knew about the perfume thing, this may have been something to bring up with the mom beforehand)", "NTA\n\nYou shared your experience of meeting a legend. I actually think this is an interesting fact and brings more life to the story. I have a friend who has horses and every time she gets home after riding or taking care of them she smells like a horse. It is just a fact of animal caring and nothing to hide.", "NTA. I was a big fan of the James Herriot book series growing up. One of the things I remember him talking about was instructing a group of young veterinary students as he was examining a cow \u2026 rectally. He said that watching him removing his entire (excrement covered) arm from a cow\u2019s anus is often the defining moment that separates many of the real vets from the students who can\u2019t take it. If your friend\u2019s daughter is icked out at the idea of gross things and smells, she probably likes the idea of animals more than actual animals. That\u2019s not to say that she won\u2019t ever go into an animal related field, but it\u2019s good that you introduced the idea that it won\u2019t always be clean and pretty. I don\u2019t know why your friend wanted to keep his daughter in the dark about this but better she found this out in the beginning.", "Your friend asked you to share your memories of seeing Steve Irwin with her daughter and you did. Talking about how working with animals can make you smell like them is just a fact. I think that part of the story made the anecdote more interesting. Talking about that would not \u2018ruin Steve Irwin\u2019 for most people. Who knew her daughter would fixate on that one aspect of the story? NTA.", "NTA\n\nWtf is wrong with people? Of course people working with animals will smell bad sometimes\u2026I mean, you can say he smelt normal most of the time when he hadn\u2019t been cleaning pens.\nI mean, what is the intention here? To lie to the child about it until they visit the zoo one time? Or a pet store? Absurd.", "NTA\n\nShe's 13.  She needs to know the realities of things she's interested in.", "Anymore stories you'd share? Please? I freaking love Steve Irwin, you're so lucky to have met him! Oh, also NTA, it's common sense animals are gonna stink.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting to read about a really young kid that got upset finding out he died.\n\nHow the ever loving fuck can you as a parent let your kid get to 13 and not realise animals create waste and stink? Poor kid is going to get hit by the real world like a fucking frieght train.", "NTA. If you read up on it, a lot of people who have wanted to work at zoos forever realize there dream only to end up quitting after a few months as they didn\u2019t know that you end up smelling like the animals you care for. Not all of them, but many.", "NTA. Working with animals/wildlife means working with poop of every consistency and stinks and stenches that you cannot anticipate.\n\nImagine if this girl got a couple years into a degree before realizing working with animals is like 5% beauty/majesty and 95% cleaning poop, giving them medicines so they are alive to poop, and feeding them to ensure they have something to poop.\n\nYou did her a favour and potentially saved her much debt and heartache.", "NTA. As a former Zookeeper yeah we stink. It's dirty work and it's just part of the job. Uniform was instantly washed and a thorough shower was had the second I got home after each shift. Id be covered in blood, piss, shit and sometimes mites. Not to mention general dirt and mud. If anything it's a badge we wear with honour and that should make sense to a 13 year old. She's not 5. This whole thing is so strange. I have no idea why she would care about that.", "NTA - has that kid never been to the zoo? They stink and that's because of all the animals surely she must have known by age 13 that the humans that keep those habitats clean in turn smell until they can get home to shower.", "NTA, i thought you told her he was dead and she didnt know. who cares if he stunk, he was at work and dirty. your friends are wierd", "Came in here thinking she didn\u2019t know he was dead. Has she never been to a zoo? Every enclosure smells, even through glass.", "NTA OMG I thought you were going to say he was fake or made an inappropriate pass at you or something like that! I was really bracing myself because I've always heard he was an all around awesome dude! \n\nBut it was that he smelled bad? Working at the zoo? Nah, these people need to get a grip.", "NTA\n\nI was worried you\u2019d gone into gory detail about his death or something. Animals smell, and if you work closely with them, you\u2019ll smell. Has she never been to a zoo?", "NTA for your friends daughter.\n(But maybe for sharing that you met Steve in person and now I'm envious. I miss him)", "She might as well find out now.  Zookeepers stink, the smell soaks into their hair and clothes, and doesn't go away with a simple wash.  They usually marry other zookeepers.  That is just the life.\n\nIf she is a spa and perfume girlie, now is a good time to think about a different career.  You can't wear perfume and smell like flowery soap if you are a zookeeper -- not only impractical but animals hate it!  Is there something stronger than NTA like YAGDH (you're a god damn hero)?  You didn't even try to scare her off, just mentioned it in passing...so now she knows!", "I mean, if that's enough to deter her interest in wildlife, it's better she find out now rather than later. fact of the matter is, working with animals is dirty work. probably in the same league as doing something like waste removal or garbage collection. NTA.", "Don\u2019t scare me like that. I thought you were going to say something bad about Steve Irwin lol", "NTA\n\nSomehow your friend doesn't have any logic. And thinks that her daughter knowing that animals smell has ruined things for her.\n\nIf her daughter is that prissy. What if she'd gotten a dog or cat and then realised they smell. Would she have given up the dog? Abandoned it?\nHeck even rabbits and everything else?\n\nKid and the mother needs a dose of reality.", "NTA, also I\u2019d prefer the smell of animals to perfumes any day of the week. There is a good chance I\u2019ll get a huge headache or asthma from perfume and it sucks.", "Nta I had to reread to check the age I was thinking on 3yrs old or something. No wait..13. \nHow is animal poo not appropriate for a young girl... girl or boy, animals shit. And it gets on your clothes and in your hair and it stinks. Wow. Nta at all OP! I think your story is hilarious", "I was ready to come at you with that title, but nope. I love that the worst thing you can say about Steve Irwin is that he smells like he worked in a zoo. I miss that guy! NTA", "NTA- she\u2019s 13 not 5, it\u2019s not inappropriate. Also, its not disrespectful, just part of his story and life, like you said. That girls mother might want to pull her head out of the clouds a bit.", "NTA. As a fan from him, I would love this story, makes him more human. She is 13 ffs, are you sure she is not on the spectrum?", "I thought she was gonna be sad that you told her that Steve died, lol", "NTA. I thought this was going to be about Steve dying, not that wild animals who don't bathe with soap can smell. Has she never been around a dog who needed a bath?", "You shared a funny anecdote about a celebrity you met a couple times, nothing offensive, nothing rude. NTA.", "Okay, NTA, obviously, but also, you had me all worried I was going to open this up and learn that Steve was credibly accused of some kind of MeToo kind of situation or it turned out that he was abusing the critters or something, and let me tell you, I was scared.", "NTA. You work with animals you need to be able to be okay with them pooping and peeing all around and on you. It\u2019s the same for a vet, a zookeeper and anyone that works with animals. You end up smelling like poop. I had a friend that used to work on a pig farm and the smell got on his clothes and his hair everywhere and pig crap smells atrocious.", "Lol this is hilarious. At 13 she still hasn\u2019t realised animals poo and cleaning it up is smelly work? \nNTA. She\u2019s lucky to learn now, rather than dedicate her time to something that would be a massive dealbreaker.", "In my opinion: NTA\n\nOh for fucks sake. Who the fuck at 13 years old doesn\u2019t know animals smell? I mean at the most basic level, humans smell, so common sense would dictate that other animals probably smell as well. Especially since they don\u2019t typically have a shower when they get all dirty/sweaty. Let alone the waste they produce. \n\nShe\u2019s never been to a zoo before? I\u2019ve personally never been to a zoo or aquarium(and I\u2019ve been to quite a few) across the US) that didn\u2019t have a specific stench. I\u2019d venture to guess it\u2019s at just about every zoo. \n\nI\u2019m so flabbergasted at this as I\u2019m writing it. I\u2019m sorta feeling like there\u2019s something else going on here. This is so off the wall, out of the ordinary imho. Do you think there is something you aren\u2019t telling us about her, or they aren\u2019t telling you? I just can\u2019t believe a thirteen year old wouldn\u2019t know animals stink, and furthermore the mom would broadcast that her kid didn\u2019t know animals stink.", "NTA. You couldn\u2019t have known her reaction. Probably best she\u2019s scared out of it now so she has time for a new passion before she starts making study choices in earnest.", "NTA. I was bracing myself for some really awful story about his behavior and your \u201cstinky Steve\u201d story was a relief.", "NTA: 1 she\u2019s 13. She can face reality. 2. It wouldn\u2019t be inappropriate at ANY age. 3. It\u2019s a silly story. I would have laughed and really enjoyed it. 4. Can you imagine her going through the next few years thinking this is her dream job only to be very disappointed to find out she will hate smelling ALL THE TIME. I think you did her a favor.", "NTA. When I first saw the thread I thought she got upset because you told her he died years ago but\n.. Really?", "Was I the only one expecting them to talk about him dying and not how he smelled?\n\nNTA", "NTA what did her parents want, her to get a whole degree in zoology just to never use it because animals smell bad? When was she supposed to learn?", "It's better for her to learn now how bad animals smell. Imagine her choosing a path in her life to work with animals and when she gets there, everything smells so bad she can't handle it. \n\nAnimals smell, all of them. They don't mind and usually most zoo-keepers don't care after a while either. \n\nMy dream when I was a teen was to see Steve up close. I cried when he passed away. The fact that he was so eager to talk to your group and didn't shower before hand, shows to be how much love he had to had he was doing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's really neat that you shared a relevant story with her to help her get a better comprehensive view of what working with animals is like. Better to get the full picture early! There was an AITA thread that recently discussed how being a zookeeper was really hard because they smell ALL THE TIME.", "Nta. By 13 she should know that wild animals don\u2019t go to the groomer and get bows in their hair like the family dog. Her mother is an idiot for calling you out and thinking her kid\u2019s life should be all spa parties and bubbles.", "Former zookeeper. Can confirm that we always smelled terrible haha.  Primates are also the worst but otter poop is a special kind of awful.", "NTA:  I hate it when people sugarcoat anything to kids.  Age-appropriate explanations? Yes.  Lying?  No.  I grew in the country, horses, meat cattle, chickens, show rabbits for 4-H, cats, dogs, rehabbed coons, skunks, and other critters too....and let me tell you while working in the barn or in the outside paddocks and sometimes falling into...stuff.  I'm sure I smelled wonderful!  \n\n\nThat is why there was a mudroom and the washer was right off of it.  LOL!", "NTA.\nIf she's finicky about smells, she's going to have to get over that sooner or later to work with animals. As cute as they are, as precious as they are, animals fucking pong. \n\nIt wasn't inappropriate to tell her an objective fact, nor is it disrespectful. Everyone I know who works with animals, who end up smelling like said animals, don't find it embarrassing. It's just part of the job.\n\nIf finding out that a zookeeper smells like animals and their waste occasionally turns her off of her wanted career path, it wasn't very wanted to begin with tbh. I hope she'll get back on it, but with the realistic expectation that, sometimes, she is going to stink like a baboon's rear - and that's okay.", "NTA my daughter would have thought that was hilarious.", "NTA - poor girl needed to have a hard dose of reality\n\nI was the same when I was younger. I was dead set certain I was going to be a vet/vet nurse, because I wanted to \"look after animals\", until I went to a careers expo, I was a very naive child, and didn't realise that I would need to perform surgery on the animals.
