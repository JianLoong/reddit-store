I assume she made nominal provision to your siblings so they didn\u2019t contest the will, and that lawyers were involved to make it very tight/solid.\n\nThere\u2019s an assumption in our society that everyone is equal. Everyone is NOT equal. (I know, bring in the down vote army!) \u2026 Some people have more capability than others, some have higher needs, some are given golden tickets (like scholarships or friend of friend\u2019s families who arrange awesome internships), and some are hit by nukes not of their own making (like parents who declare bankruptcy in the child\u2019s teen years, or medical events and accidents).  Then there\u2019s some people who take the time to learn to be responsible, considered and careful, and those who well into their 20s or 30s (or according to the Reddit AITA OPs\u2026 40s and 50s!) continue to let money fall through their fingers like water, who do not proactive mitigate threats to their security, who don\u2019t think beyond the next minutes.\n\nIt sounds like your grandmother has decided to support you because she can see you making the most of what she gives you. For some reason she believes splitting the assets between you and your siblings isn\u2019t in the family\u2018s best interests (and you hint that you know why). Yes, this means you\u2019ll never have a good relationship with your siblings, but are your siblings going to ever recover from this anyway? And whatever is the issue between the siblings and your grandmother - will that be a likely conundrum in your relationship with your siblings going forward? Are they going to ask you (after you split the inheritance, and they blow through it), to help them financially? Are they going to be bitter at you regardless of if you split it or not if you are savvy with finances and grow your share (whether that be 100% or 30%) to a wealthy they do not?\n\nThe downfall of the Great Houses of England was exacerbated when families started trying to carve up estates to give something to every child. When it was no longer fashionable to leave some children in lessor conditions than others. Your Grandmother is trying to preserve her wealth and success and make sure it is enough to support one line of hte family - the one most likely to be sensible and have something more to give on again. Edit to add: The watering down of finances across multiple lines of family reduces the impact and value that money can have and may leave each line at a lower level. In some thoughts it can be worth lifting a responsible, kind hearted line higher, knowing they will likely support the other lines along the way. In the Estates of England (yes, I\u2019m capitalising a generalisation here) there was an assumption that while one person inherited the lions share, they would support and mitigate risks for the entire family. It was all kept intact, but there was serious responsibility heaped on that one person to protect the family name and manage the rest of the family, and protect the assets for future generations. This inheritance from your grandmother could be similar - to protect it she\u2019s kept it in one (given to the person most likely to protect and grow it), but has an expectation that you will support other members of the family (within limits), and hand it all on. \n\nIf it\u2019s a LOT of money you could consider setting up a small college fund for your siblings\u2019 kids (I\u2019m not sure how that works, I\u2019m in Australia where HECS takes care of university fees), and manage it cleanly and separately to your own money. If your siblings are wildly financially rough then protect that money legally by specifying exactly what it is for, and locking it into a trust if necessary. That way you are honouring your grandmother\u2019s wish that the next generations have a good life, but not diluting it or giving it to people who might waste it. Your grandmothers LAST will and testament is her wishes.", "What did you do for your grandparents that your siblings did not?  Or did your grandparents play favorites.   It's understandable for your grandparents to leave you all of their assets if you were the only grand child who spent any time with them or did not use them as a babysitter or use their financial resources.  \n\nI can understand your siblings being upset about the outcome but your grandparents specifically left their estate to you and not to them so if their reasons were valid, you should follow their wishes.  If they did it to be cruel or your grandparents treated you as the golden child, you may want to reconsider.", "Your grandparents made their wishes known.

As a grandparent there can be many reasons to leave just to one grandchild that are not sexual orientation or racism.

It's actually pretty hard to break a will, unless there is some statutory provision in play (eg:  leaving a spouse less then the statutory minimum they are entitle too).   It happens, but not as often as people think.", "Yup. It\u2019s easy to claim your elderly grandparents simply forgot to bequeath you an equal share, but that becomes much harder when you\u2019re named and bequeathed twenty bucks (or nothing at all)", "Legally, you are correct. But being an asshole isn\u2019t illegal. So being in this subreddit means the legal question isn\u2019t what\u2019s at issue. \n\nIf grandma decided that OP\u2019s siblings deserve no money because they got the COVID vaccine, or married someone of the wrong social class, or something dumb - OP should give them some money. Otherwise OP is saying they agree that those things are bad. If OP agrees with their reasoning, they can express that by not sharing. If OP approves of them getting gay married or whatever, OP should share.", "Really?  Even when prejudice and bigotry are the reasons?", "Right. What if their \u201creasons\u201d are sibling 1 was gay, and sibling 2 refused to get the degree the GP\u2019s chose for them?", "Idk why I'm being downvoted. Like I said, both statements can be independently accurate it's just weird to me turning it into a \"this therefore that\" declaration. OP remains NTA, though.", "I disagree. Say the total estate is 300k, that's 15k each, it's not 1/3 but it's not nothing. But it's a hell of a lot better than the grandparents decided to leave them", "Well of course they don't-- they're dead. \n\nOP does, though, because she asked for judgment on a forum where people make judgments about who is an asshole. We have to know if the reasons are assholish reasons, or non-assholish reasons. We can only judge that if we know what they are.\n\nOP obviously *knows* what the reasons are, because she mentioned them. So it has nothing to do with the grandparents owing anyone an explanation, because the explanation already exists and is known by others-- it's just not known to *us.*", "Well of course, but we kinda need an explanation if we\u2019re gonna vote on whether OP is TA", "The grandparents are dead.\n\nCan you imagine a scenario in which their reasons are not justified?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, lets say that they were upset that his brother and his sister had interracial marriages. Or were homosexual. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn that case, OP would be an asshole for not sharing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there are reasons that would make him not the asshole", "It was their wealth to give to whoever they wanted... what if the siblings \"borrowed\" money all of the time, but op didn't because op did the right things in life? We can come up with scenarios all day long... at the end of the day, the money and property were GIVEN to OP. Is it wrong not to share? Absolutely not.", "If they were disinherited for those reasons, they should refuse the sharing of the inheritance on principal.\n\nIf my girlfriend's family disowned her for dating a black man, I would refuse anything from them unless it came with an apology.", "This isn\u2019t r/legal. It\u2019s r/AmItheAsshole. OP isn\u2019t asking if she\u2019s on the right side of the law. You can do a ton of things legally and still be an asshole.", "Sounds like it became one for the OP.", "Just because someone won't win a case doesn't mean they won't try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich just wastes everyone's money", "Then that would make the grandparents, not the OP, the AH.", "Ya there's some real odd downvoting going on here...", "I'm sure they'd take it, but I don't think it would get the OP peace.  My guess is that the siblings are grasping types who won't be happy unless they get a full 1/3.", "If that is the situation then absolutely NTA. \n\nBut I am saying that we don't have enough info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>at the end of the day, the money and property were GIVEN to OP. Is it wrong not to share? Absolutely not.\n\nIf the reasons were blatantly discriminatory then yes.", "Exactly. I\u2019m just saying there might be a good reason to ignore the GP\u2019s wishes.", "No, you're wrong.", "Possibly, but the fact that the siblings are demanding a share (rather than humbly accepting the outcome or relying on OPs moral compass to ensure a fair outcome) makes me think GPs had good reasons."]}
