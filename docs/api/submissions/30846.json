Not bringing enough diapers is an easy mistake to make and things like packing for babies and toddlers should really be a team effort.

I understand why you got frustrated if this isn\u2019t a one time thing, but one in a long line of him forgetting or failing to plan. And he sucks for that - you should be able to count on your partner to pull their weight instead of having to do all the responsibilities and planning yourself. \n\nBut blowing up at him in front of his family isn\u2019t cool either.

It seems like you are walking on eggshells trying to work through the issues with your spouse, trying to be patient with him while he doesn't pull his weight. It also sounds like being around his family might make him regress or perhaps their general attitude of him being oh-so-wonderful for doing the bare minimum means he is not making much progress in general. The thought of you all having to walk around town with a baby blow out and a pee soaked outfit, yet you still apologized for snapping. Who wouldn't snap about a scene like that? And I would guess that they only saw you react to his forgetfulness but not your apology later. Then your MIL and SIL (who sound like they encourage his incompetence) attack you. Of course you feel ganged up on!  If they were concerned then they could have pulled your husband aside quietly, and hopefully her could have taken responsibility for his forgetfulness and told them that you two have worked through it.

I think if the issue were anything other than a messy bathroom accident, I might have less sympathy for you.\n\nUltimately I think critiquing a failure on your part to \"acknowledge the things your spouse does right\" is a bizarre reaction to witnessing the argument you describe, and that tells me their concern is less about one thing they saw that they did not like, and more about your broader marital issues.

I grew up with a lot of younger siblings and planning does come more naturally to me. I have asked my spouse to take a more active role and recognize when they\u2019re trying I\u2019m also trying to get it to a point where we share the emotional labor since we both work full time. Domestic labor tends to fall on the woman most of the time and my spouse recognizes that. But his family overlooks the fact that we both work and live earn very similar income. They are more set in gender roles which influence their perception of how things should go\u2026 and who should be responsible for the diaper bag lol", "This is fair. I think I do have some work to do with my therapist regarding conflict resolution.

We were stuck in a ski town with no where to get clothing or diapers with a three year old with wet pants and a two years old with diarrhea all over bottom half, or else it definitely wouldn\u2019t have been an issue but I agree that I shouldn\u2019t have shown frustration toward my spouse.", "I\u2019m not sure where or how I \u201cdoubled down\u201d can you elaborate? This probably wouldn\u2019t have been an issue normally bc typically I\u2019m the one that packs. I plan everything, and do everything and I asked my spouse to help me more with the emotional labor and tasks. We both work full time and a lot of the time the child rearing falls on me.

My spouse\u2019s family is who berated me lol. I came out of the bathroom and let my spouse know that our two year old had diarrhea and that he didn\u2019t pack the diapers. We were at a resteraunt so everyone was within earshot. They admitted that they had grabbed the diaper bag and didn\u2019t check to see what was inside bc they were rushing. This is where we had a disagreement, bc at that point we had to drive an hour back to our hotel. It\u2019s frustrating to have to be the one who remembers everything. That was the quarrel. Both of us raised our voices at one another and both of us got frustrated, we apologized and squashed it on the way home. \n\nWhat made it bigger than it needed to be was that my spouses family decided to offer their feedback on our relationship bc this is the first time I\u2019ve ever held my spouse accountable for weaponizing incompetence.", ">we went back to the our accommodations & I was confronted by both my MIL & SIL (separately) for my failure to acknowledge \u201cthe things my spouse does right\u201d and only seeing the negative.

This also came from my spouse venting to their mother about situation.\n\nSo they decided to take what your spouse said to them privately and  turn it into a confrontation with them?   Your problems begin and end with your spouse, and he should have told his parents to but-out.   You said you will be talking to your spouse about the incident but what have you done about your spouse not pulling their weight?   Are they in counseling themselves?\n\nAs a first step, your spouse should apologize to his family for involving them in a situation when they did not have the full story and ask them to give you both space.   Then the two of you have to redouble efforts to resolve the core problem.", "NTA, your partner playing incompetent only for his sister and mommy to come rushing to say what a special little man he is, is pathetic. Next time he can take the trip on his own, and take care of the kids on his own.", "NTA. How would your spouse have felt if you had called your mom and told her that they forgot to check the diaper bag and then your mom later called them and and chewed their ass for their incompetence? Their mom and sister do not need to participate in your relationship.", "NTA.  For everyone saying E S H and Y T A.  Do you have any idea how frustrating and exhausting it is to always have to be \"on\" because your partner never is?\n\nNo one should be applauded for the bare minimum.  If you are with another human,  in a relationship, things should be as equal as possible.  That means that sometimes one will have to carry more weight on occasion but it shouldn't always be a single partner.  And if one partner says \"I'll pack for the kids\" the other partner should not have to confirm or double check that it has been done and done properly, otherwise, there is no point in the volunteering partner doing the task.  Because it is infinitely more stressful than the \"on\" partner just doing it themselves.\n\nDads do not \"babysit their kids\".

They really have no idea how bad it is at home and were probably brought up with very different social norms. \n\nSo do what I did, completely opt out of any responsibilities for those things on your next trip. Let the dad know he is 100% responsible. So if there is any problem with kid\u2026 say \u2018oh that\u2019s the father responsibility today. You know we do 50/50 since we both work\u2019. Today is his day. No diapers, child peed on themselves\u2026 \u2018welp today was Dad\u2019s day, here you go\u2026 why don\u2019t you hold baby, you might want to do something about that so they don\u2019t get a rash. I\u2019m going back to hotel, I\u2019m tired.\u2019 If anyone protest, say innocently \u2018he knows he\u2019s the dad of this child, why wouldn\u2019t we share responsibilities?\u2019 When the kids are good and happy, be with them and give them lots of cuddles and love. Throwing trantrum, they want or need something\u2026 \u2018you\u2019ll have to go ask your father\u2019. It\u2019s his turn. Believe me after a couple of days of this, their laid back attitude will change in a hurry.\n\nAs for your in-laws, you might be able to salvage your relationship but set boundaries. I would say something like \u2018you have no idea what our lives are like at home. If you would like me to give you a run-down, I can do that, but I would hate to burst your illusions. I love you both and would like to continue to have a good relationship with you. So in future, please wait for me to ask before you start giving me advise. Can you do that?\u2019 If yes, all good. If no, the. \u2018Well I\u2019m sorry that we will have to spend less time with you.\u2019 Everything should be said calmly, and end calmly.", "That's weaponized incompetence - they do it so badly that you eill take on all future planning and packing.  I take my hat off to you for not unloading on spouse's parents the real situation,  since spouse decided it was a good idea to involve their parents in your disagreement.", "NTA.\n\n\"Respectfully, this is neither of your places to give opinions about my marriage. You are not part of it, don't have ANY background context to feed into it and this conversation is both unwelcome and uncomfortable. For the sake of enjoying the rest of this trip, let's move on.\"", "nta. Dad's always do the bare minimum and get praise and applause for it while the mom is ridiculed for anything that goes wrong. They need to be held to the same standard as moms and expected to actually parent. It sounds like you are always keeping it running smoothly, and your spouse is the fun parent. I'd have said something too about it. It's not hard to pack a bag for the day of clothes and diapers and be prepared for anything. I'm glad you called him out. It's time he stepped up past time, really. If he didn't like it, who cares? He needs a reality check, and his family needs to stop applauding him for doing nothing and see what kind of parent he actually is.", "They over-stepped boundaries and don't see your spouse for the under-performer that they are.  NTA...", "You wrote this as gender neutral, but it was immediately obvious you are female and your partner is male.\n\nIt's good you and your husband are working through the issues regarding your picking up the emotional labor + parenting duties. It's also good you recognize that while you might be the less \"laid back\" parent, it's inappropriate for your partner to not appropriately handle basic diaper + clothing needs for your kids. There's things like \"I prefer to have no dishes left in the sink overnight and my spouse prefers to soak the pans\" level of disagreement -- this ain't it. You snapped and you apologized. That should have been the end of the argument.\n\nThe bigger (and possibly insolvent) issue here is that your husband ran to his mommy and sister when he didn't  / doesn't feel appreciated enough, so they would bully you into compliance. Complaining about your spouse to your parents is absolutely toxic, doubly so because your spouse knows how his family treats you. You were right to leave.\n\nYou will never get acceptance inside your spouse's family if he doesn't start 1) acknowledging the inequity in labor in many dimensions and working towards a more equitable distribution and 2) keep his mouth shut and deal with your marital issues inside the marriage.\n\nAlso - your spouse will definitely learn about how to do his fair share of labor if you end up divorced with 50/50 custody...\n\nNTA.", "Laidback is so often a polite way of saying a bit useless. \n\nJust because your spouse isn\u2019t maliciously doing a poor job doesn\u2019t make the impact any less. Partnership involves doing what we say we will do, especially when it comes to the well-being of children.\n\nAnd either your spouse is totally spinning it differently to the in-laws, or they have been raised in an environment where it\u2019s \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019 and you will be fighting an uphill battle. Either way, them getting involved would have crossed a line for me too, and if leaving was what you needed, then it was the right thing for you to do.\n\nLastly, I get you love them, but unless your spouse actually sees their culpability in this, and genuinely wants to change how they show up in your relationship; this will be a battle for the duration of your relationship. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your in-laws were out of line and should not have bullied you. Of course they are going to biased, especially as they do not deal with this every. single. day.", "NTA. And his family needs to learn their place. Them confronting you about something they know nothing about would\u2019ve gotten them both checked.", "NTA. Why are your in-laws treating your spouse like they\u2019re the second coming of Christ because they, I dunno, smile at their children every once in a while, or whatever the bare minimum is?\n\nLike others have said, it\u2019s very clear that your spouse is male and you are female. \n\nI may be biased here, because in the circles I\u2019m in, the fathers I know are completely devoted to their children, and the very idea of them not pulling their weight is unacceptable. My brother has been a father for four weeks and he has himself said that he doesn\u2019t understand why other new dads don\u2019t want to be equal parents\u2026 but dads are not worthy of praise unless they are doing at least half the work, without being asked.", "NTA. We're you supposed to stay another tonight with your poor kid covered in pee? Forgetting clothing for your kids is idiotic. Like I get misjudging the number of diapers or forgetting socks or one thing but, no clothes at all for the kids? He didn't even try.", "NTA. I remember those days.  It was my SIL and StepMIL that stirred up problems between my husband and me.  One day it started again about I didn't appreciate everything he did.  I handed him a list of chores that seemed to be only my responsibility.  3 pages, typed.  I told him to show me how to appreciate what an adult and a parent does.  He wadded them up and threw them away.  I hung another copy on the refrigerator.\n\nEventually we talked about how his time with the kids was fun, watching movies, going to their sporting events.  While I was expected to provide the movie and drive them to practice daily.   I was supposed to make his life as smooth as possible and make everyone happy.  And when I made them happy that was my reward.  They were happy!  If I was unhappy or wanted something changed then I was wrong.  \n\nThe divorce was long and painful.  But my life has been so much better with them gone.", "ESH\n\nI get your frustration, however if you don\u2019t want others getting involved, don\u2019t vent in front of them. Berating your spouse when there was no solution and he was fully aware of the issue solved nothing, you could have waited and talked to him in private - bonus: you would have calmed down by then", "NTA\n\nAsk your MIL how she'd feel if she thought you had gone to your family to complain about her precious baby, and the family cornered them and inserted themselves into the marriage, lauding you and blaming your spouse.  \n\nFirst, spouse complaining to MIL.  Second, MIL getting involved.  Bad choices and not fair to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, being 100% on your side, I'll just point out that a marriage where someone does the planning and someone rolls with whatever comes up is really common for a reason.  I agree with MIL, you do need to try to \"catch\" your spouse doing something right.  You don't need to tell MIL, but you do need to see clearly the whole picture and not just what is missing.  This society where everyone is overworked and stressed about money and then there are children to take care of, well it is just all so hard and so harsh it can be tough to stay positive.  I can only say that in my case, as the kids got older, it got better and better and I would not have been better off with another thinker/planner.", "NTA\n\nYou left without having a conversation with your MIL and SIL. But I'm not sure how well that conversation would have gone.\n\nYour husband made a couple of crappy mistakes that caused his kids harm and suffering. He should feel bad about that. And while losing your temper at him is not maybe the best way to deal with it, I think \"Someone harming my kid and making them suffer\" is a valid reason for a mom to lose her temper.  He hurt your kids. He hurt his kids. It was just a stupid mistake, but it was a really bad stupid mistake. This is something the two of you have to deal with together.\n\nThe appropriate place for your MIL and SIL to stay is *completely out of it*.

Or did he think that there is a magical diaper-and-clothing vending machine that he can call into existence whenever and wherever he needs it?\n\nHonestly, a teenager who has no younger siblings but has babysat *once* could probably have managed this, so why is your husband so utterly incompetent that he couldn't??\n\nWhat is his excuse?", "I have read your replies that you love your husband, but can you please tell me how you can love someone who drives you up the wall, or maybe multiple walls, who lets his kid walk around in pee-soaked pants, who isn't horrified that the other kid had a blowout and no diapers, and who isn't throwing himself on the ground at your feet being utterly apologetic?\n\nBecause I just don't get it.\n\nHow can you love such a dismissive, inconsiderate person, who is fine with you getting run ragged so he can... laze about?\n\nYou know he is only laid back, because *he does nothing of any sort of labour.*\n\nSo no. I don't get it, and neither do the others, because it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nNobody decent would be ok with their kids suffering (and walking around in soiled underwear *is* suffering), with their partner suffering.", "It was a day trip, not the whole vacation. It was dad's job to pack the kids' bag for the day, and he didn't bring anything.  Why should mom have to fucking double check the other parent did what they said they would do??", "I did read the post. Let the kids suffer and send them to Dad handle. Set boundaries with the inlaws. Fine, set boundaries. But don't make your kids suffer to prove a point. That's what I am saying. I was married for 34 years. My husband was a district manager for a restaurant chain. That's a person who travels alot. We have 2 kids. I was a full time employee of an international insurance company. I supervised 17 people. No, I didn't have a nanny or any baby sitters. I'm sorry you are burned out. But that is what being a parent and spouse is. Yeah, when he was home, we shared responsibilities. But I knew what my responsibilities were. You need a break, fine. Take a break. Take a spa day. But sending the kids to Dad to handle when they came to you is a crappy thing to do to them.", "I mean, shit happens with babies. Even if you'd remembered everything, you'd still have been stuck carrying soiled stuff and kids around.", "And I bet she has never made a mistake before either", "The OP says \u201cthey were supposed to pack diapers and didn\u2019t pack enough.\u201d", "Right! My husband is very thorough. He always double check and over pack when our kids were small. Being caught without diapers, wipes and change of clothes is the worst. OP MIL and SIL were AH! I\u2019ve lost it on my husband before and my MIL and SIL never interfered in our disputes. If my husband is wrong my in laws always has my back. When I\u2019m upset and loses it around my MIL I do explain to her why I\u2019m upset.", "Thanks for that clarification, Mikacakes. I kept saying to myself,  who is 'they'?... \"they were supposed to pack diapers and didn\u2019t pack enough, and they forgot a change of clothes for our children.\"  I thought for a while this was about some plural marriage thing, then I thought, 'Oh, her native language isn't English.' Gender-neutral writing makes for a lot of confusion. \n\nIn any case, OP, YNA. Let your husband read some of these responses. His behavior is weaponized incompetence. It also shows how little he truly cares about the comfort of his own children. You may well love him, but you must question if it is returned to you and your children when he so blatantly \"forgets\" the comfort of anyone beyond himself. And running to tattle to his mommy ...not mature male behavior.", "That's really kind of sad, it sounds like the adult generation did what they could to build social bonds and lasting memories for you guys!   \n\nIt's too bad it did not work out.", "Lol spoken like someone who hasn\u2019t been there. There is \u201ceveryone makes mistakes\u201d and then there is \u201cif I never thought through all the planning, our children would be diaper-less and naked at the end of each day.\u201d\n\nCountless people in this thread of comments know exactly what she\u2019s talking about. Many parents have been in her position and knew she was the mom. This isn\u2019t about a random mistake; if it were, she wouldn\u2019t be writing here.", "You didn\u2019t want to make it a gender issue but it very much IS a gender issue. \n\nIt could, in a different iteration with different details, not be a gender issue. But these particulars make it one. \n\nCalling it out as such helps name some of the contributing factors. And that\u2019s the only way you can get real change.", "I actually liked that you wrote it as neutrally as possible and that it still came out very obviously as a very gendered issue.", "You did an awful job. \ud83d\ude02 We all knew which one was a man based on your 3rd paragraph. \u201c My spouse and I have been dealing with our own marital conflicts due to emotional labor and lack of equitable distribution of tasks. My in-laws see the good things my spouse does and praise them for being a \u201cgreat parent\u201d for doing the bare minimum.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nI shouldn\u2019t laugh; but the alternative is to cry at the reality.", "Without making it a gender issue, either way you are doing the majority of the work. It gets draining,  not to mention stressful when you are constantly feeling like the weight of the world is on your shoulders because the other party will drop the ball. It also tends to happen that the in laws tend to back the person you're married to more often than you. I don't often see in-laws able to overlook the blood ties. Male or female I think that's also a big factor in your problem here. I would leave too if they can't butt out. NTA.", "Commenting here in hopes you see this. \nI\u2019m addition to your hubby being subpar- he brought his parents into your marriage dispute. This has nothing to do with them. His lack of accountability in this situation is the same issue presenting in a different way. \nHe\u2019s not more laid back than you, he just knows that you\u2019ll pick up his slack so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about it. \nThere is a lot of great advice here, but at the end of the day you have to choose if you want a partner or a liability? What\u2019s the point of having another adult if you have to check their work and remind them of their duties. If this was work that guy would be fired.", "I think driving home six hours in the dead of night from a remote area with babies in the car was a bit of an overreaction. There, I said it.", "Here's the deal:\n\nWomen are expected to do most everything household related, including all child stuff. Men get high-fives if most of their piss ends up in the bowl...\n\n\\*typo", "Okay Daddy."]}
