I don\u2019t know, for some reason your boss gave you a second chance so you can\u2019t be a complete AH\u2026 changing your clock in and out times by a minute here and there is very different to putting product in your bags and walking out with it.

The others were caught stealing product.  If the company decides not to offer them a second chance, that's not your problem.  Every company is different on how they handle the breaking of rules.

You were not connected to deciding the firing decision.", "NTA It\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s the manager\u2019s decision. Quite frankly I would have fired you for wage theft and fraud but at least you are doing the right thing now. Tbh that might be why your manager kept you on. Keep squealing if you want to keep your job.", "who's the third person and why were they laid off?", "NTA. Thieves should be fired, no matter how they got caught.", "YTA. Its not your job to police your coworkers, and you continued to create a horrible environment there. It does sound vindictive since you're not morally superior to them as you *tried to falsify your records to look like you were on time*. Its not being late that's the issue, its the attempted fraud.", "YTA, you don't snitch on colleagues. At least you talk to them first, and give them a warning, the second time you can always tell on them.", "NTA. YOU did not fire these people. Your company did. Your company decided not to fire you for theft (you stole time, they stole product) but decided to fire these people. You alerting security to employee theft is arguably simple loyalty to the company that cut you a break when they did not have to. Had you demanded these people be fired, then you could be judged to be an AH. But you didn't, you just did what any employee ought to do when they see theft. So NTA", "NTA\u2026their offense was considerably worse than yours\u2026and it was up to boss to give them a second chance or not. Perhaps work performance or previous issues played into his decision.", "NTA.  Stealing company products is a different level of sin to stealing company time.  Both are grounds of dismissal, but you boss likes you as a worker and give you a chance.  Be a punctual and honest worker from now on.  Being honest to letting management know about thieves is the right thing to do.", "To be fair, its not that really an essential products. Its something that our company manufactures.

Give an employee a second chance and let them know they are being watched\u2026 suddenly they are reporting everything and playing by the rules.", "Is Walmart really a good example for this case? They'll fuck their employees every way possible then tell them to go apply for government assistance when they can't afford to live.", "The 3rd person is the one who gave them the items", "I was not aware that there is someone that gave them the item. Eventually his name was mentioned during the investigation. All i did was report to the guard what i saw (that the two of them are putting something on their bag, so might as well check it)", "Then it's sort of grey. \n\nAs a responsible employee of the company, you did right by reporting on attempt of theft. They were not penalised/fired because of you, but because of their own acts. You were following your professional responsibility. \n\nBut as a human being, if you realise that they were poor people and reporting on them always had the probability that they'll be fired, you could have not made it your business and turned a blind eye. But then, you were in their shoes earlier and were given a second chance, so it's natural that they'd get a second chance too. \n\nI wouldn't put this case either in NTA or YTA. It's sort of in the middle."]}
