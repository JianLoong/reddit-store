Three years ago\n(2020) I kind of bonded with Fred (28M) and we\u2019re flirting. In this year there\nwas also a new guy, Chad (30M), who is probably on the spectrum. He is a sweet\nguy in general but has problems managing his emotions, has problems with\naccepting boundaries and interactions. He kind of liked Fred and me and so we\nwere hanging out together. \n\nAfter the\nclass Chad kept contact with me. He was engaged at this time and had problems\nwith his fianc\u00e9. I tried my best to be there though I felt like I wasn't\nimportant in this friendship cause we constantly talked about his problems and\nI had no room. He finally broke up with her and my gut feeling told me I was\nnext... as I learned later, he even asked Fred if it was okay to\n\"pursue\" me. \n\nWhen Covid\nhid in 2021 he came for one day to my city and asked me whether we could take a\nwalk and then it became very clear to me that he was interested, so I got\nscared and reduced the contact immediately. Shortly after this I met my now\nboyfriend and am since then in a happy relationship.\n\nIn summer\n2021 in the next summer class and Chad was very disappointed that I had a bf\nand cried several times about it when I wasn't there (the others told me). At\nthe end of the class I had to talk to him because I felt very uncomfortable\nbecause he constantly tried to be around me and he still hoped that I would\nleave my bf for him. I told him that this wouldn't happen and that I don't\nthink it is a good idea to continue a friendship. He cried for hours on this\nday.\n\n2022 my\nboyfriend participated for a day, too, and Chad got very aggressive and was\npouting the whole day. Later in the class he was telling other participants I\nwas mean (several participants were defending me) and I talked again with him again\nand he cried again all day.\n\nI feel like\nI'm a burden because he is taking so much energy from everyone, teachers and\nstudents, because he thinks he is in love with me. I try to be smaller because\nhe says there is his safe place but it was initially mine (this class helped me\nthrough a difficult time and I was first) and I'm sometimes feeling like I'm\ntaking too much space just by being happy because then he'll get his hopes up\nagain. This year's class is coming up soon and I'm sick of holding myself back\nand not really enjoying the time I'm spending there. I met Chad a few weeks\nago, he still knows that I have a bf and he seems to still have feelings for\nme.\n\nSo I\ndecided to tell him that I don't feel comfortable, that he is acting creepy.\nThat even if I were single he wouldn't be a fit for me and that I don't want to\nbe friends with him because he showed me he can't respect my boundaries. I am angry\nand anxious at the same time so I don't know whether I'll shout or cry telling\nhim that, but I can't do this anymore. Still I'm feeling guilty because he\ndefinitely has a developmental issue and I should be the bigger person?

Report him to the people running the class for ongoing sexual harassment. Document everything and ask them to remove him from the class.", "Hi, I am autistic and a former autism specialist social worker. I have several professional qualifications specifically in relation to autism (including a masters in Autism Studies, which yes, is a thing!) I hope I can be of use here!\n\nMy first piece of advice would be to reach out to whoever organises the class. I'm sure it hasn't escaped their notice that there has been an issue before but it might help to make them aware of the situation before the class starts. They may (should!) have a policy regarding safeguarding and/or harassment within their classes. They also might well have contact with someone from his immediate support system such as a family member or support worker. Acting classes are a popular choice for socialising within the \"socially supported community\" (I was trying my best to find the right words and I don't want to offend anyone, so I hope that was okay!) and it's pretty common for them to have a friend, family member or support worker who attends these types of classes with them... I think we just like the drama! *flips hair* I assume Chad does not have a worker with him but that doesn't mean he doesn't have one. \n\nSecondly, I would write down exactly what you want to say and then rewrite it in as simple terms as possible. Then read it to yourself (maybe in the mirror?) or to someone else who is willing to listen, practice saying the things you want to say until you are confident that you know the script. ~~pun intended~~ Having the words clear in your mind will help you not get so overwhelmed in the moment, and if you do start to get overwhelmed you will have your \"script\" to hand. Potentially even just have it handy and read it out loud to him, perhaps tell him before you start that you would like him to listen to you until the end and then he can talk. Set the boundary right at the start and then be firm about it. \n\nAlso, don't hold back in your classes! Go and have fun and ignore him pouting. It's not your responsibility to \"make yourself smaller\" or to dampen your shine for anybody, disabled or not. As long as he's not in your personal space there is no reason to pay attention to his attention seeking shit. Being on the spectrum does not mean he isn't doing it for attention, and well, it's an acting class so you'd expect some theatrics! If he gets in your personal space you step out of his and firmly say \"please don't get in my personal space, thank you\". \n\nLast of all, if he continues to be a problem or refuses to take the hint after you've told him your truth then it's perfectly reasonable to tell him that if he doesn't leave you alone then you will have to involve the authorities, and then follow through. Sometimes it's just necessary to escalate, and ngl those of us on the spectrum can be a little denser than you might imagine and sometimes it has to be the big shock to actually get the message through. With most people the threat of police will be enough but obviously I don't know this guy or how he would react to that. \n\nJust a last quick one; thank you for being so kind to this man and for asking for advice about this. You're clearly a lovely person that you care about his feelings even though he's upset you this much.", "Autism isn't a mental health issue", "yeah this, NTA", "Autism isn't a mental illness", "This. Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder, it's literally a difference in the physical brain structure.", "OP thinks he's on the spectrum. He could very well not be autistic and have mental health issues. He certainly doesn't present as mentally sound.", "Oh for sure, but people are dumb and will read your comment and correlate \"mental health\" with autism. Not because you've worded it wrong or whatever. I only chimed in to clarify what autism actually is because some people won't make that distinction for themselves.", "NTA. He\u2019s mentally capable enough to have a fianc\u00e9e so he\u2019s capable of understanding boundaries and that what he\u2019s doing is wrong so don\u2019t feel at all guilty. He\u2019s using his Autism as an excuse to be an asshole!", "Similar to this guy I met at a friends party. He was nice but just no attention on my part. He did not want to just be friends. Would call me then randomly say sexually in appropriate things. I bled him to stop several times blocked him on several different numbers. It got through but took awhile. He just pout every time I said I\u2019m just interested. Drove me nuts for awhile", ">I feel like I'm a burden because he is taking so much energy from everyone, teachers and students, because he thinks he is in love with me. \n\nNo offense, but why is this your responsibility?

I try to be smaller because he says there is his safe place but it was initially mine\n\nYou are not being a burden. He is. Autistic people struggle with cues and appropriate behavior--but that doesn't meant they're incapable of learning boundaries. And they're more than capable of understanding that someone who doesn't want to date them isn't just being \"mean.\" This sounds less like an autistic thing and more like regular \"nice guy\" syndrome. He's treating you the same way tons of neurotypical guys treat girls who reject them. \n\nHe is the one making the space unsafe for people. You shouldn't have to make yourself smaller due to someone else's poor behavior.", "NTA. You have been kind and this has put you into a difficult situation. You have been clear about boundaries and now it is time for Chad to get extra support/ therapy and not make you need to get it. Talk with instructors and and school counsellors available to see if there can be official intervention\nEdit grammar", "NTA\n\nYou need to go to the program, probably in writing and explain what he has been doing and that you are now considering your attendance because you no longer feel comfortable there. Ask them if they have a policy or system that can help you by either referring you to another group or keeping you two separate.\n\nBluntly they should be stepping in years ago and stopping this. \n\nNone of this is your fault, he is causing problems and groups like this need to have an effective policy for when this type of issue comes up. If they say not to go, minimize your problems, or try to make you handle his feelings they are the ones that are failing not you. I am so sorry you are going through this.", "I think the confusion is because you didn\u2019t reply to the person who said \u201cmental health issues are never an excuse\u201d and are saying \u201cyour comment\u201d to the wrong person."]}
