It is my understanding rent is upwards of $3,000 and both of them have blue collar jobs. I believe one of the older kids also works to help make rent. I think they have 6 kids, some are adults and live with them.\n\nAs expected, these children have seen more things and have a lot more street smarts than my child. For example, I've talked to the 8YO and he mentioned witnessing some fucked up things where he used to live: drugs, prostitution shootings, etc.\n\nI started to notice every time these children come over to our house, they pretty much devour all the snacks and food they can. I told them from now on it is ONE snack and that's it.  What the kids do now is have my child sneak out food for them.  They're also coming over pretty much daily.\n\nNow, I understand these kids have had it rough. They're pretty much unsupervised all day, they have an older sister that's supposed to take care of them but TikTok is more important. They may not have food security but AITA for wanting to put an end to this? My wife thinks it's petty but, why do I need to provide a free all-inclusive daycare to these folks? No one handed me anything at any point in my life, why should I?\n\nAlso, I thought about talking to the parents but, how do I do it without deteriorating the relationship the kids have? I still want my child to hang out with them as it is a positive relationship.\n\nEDIT: IT'S NOT ONLY SNACKS. IT'S ACTUAL FOOD AS WELL.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not rich.

My younger brother has been friends with this group of brothers all his life and they would come over on their bikes and take as much food as they could, even stuffing their backpacks and pockets. They wouldn\u2019t even stop at just snacks and would go through our fridge and steal some of our leftovers as well. They clearly had food insecurity, but it became an issue for my parents very quickly as they have 4 children of their own to provide for. They were intimidated by my dad after one instance when he caught them in the act and scolded them, but they wouldn\u2019t listen to my mom at all. My dad was irritated that he needed to scold someone else\u2019s children that let themselves into his home, so he befriended their parents to learn more about their situation. They have 8 children (1f & 7m), and was clear that they struggled, but my dad discussed the issue with them and they had a conversation with their sons about respecting other people\u2019s homes. Most of their sons understood, but their two youngest didn\u2019t follow authority of any kind, so they were still a problem for a while. My mom simply made a rule that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed inside unless their parents were over. \nMy parents actually became really good friends with their parents and we invited them to all of our parties, my parents gave them financial and parenting advice, and we helped them out where we could by giving them clothes and helping the oldest children find jobs and get into college (including their mom). Now that everyone is an adult we still consider them great family friends.\n\nEdit: Also I\u2019d like to say NTA, but I think that you need to have a conversation with their parents and your son especially if he\u2019s stealing food for them.

I would not be okay with that, personally. At a guess, I\u2019d say there is food insecurity, but also likely plenty of plain food at their house, not the \u201cfun stuff\u201d you have at yours. It\u2019s worth a conversation with the parents though, to make sure there is enough. I would be severely limiting exposure anyway though, they sound like terrible influences.", "This is hard because it depends on the reasoning\n1. Are they eating all your snacks because they are hungry and need foor or are do they have adequate food but no sugary snacks at home? \n2. Do you not want to feed them because it's annoying or because you can't afford to feed these kids plus yours?\n\nIf a kid is hungry,  they should be fed.  Children do tend to take advantage when young because they don't understand all boundaries at this point, and if at home it's rice and chicken and your house has brownies and fruit snacks  there's a big difference compared to they have nothing and are genuinely hungry or they don't want what they're provided and prefer your snacks.  \n\nI think your point of one snack a day is fine, but if they're still hungry, tell them they can have a PB&J or an apple. See how they react.  If they're happy to take those things, then they probably are hungry and might really need it. Childrens metabolisms change so much in while growing they they may not have enough at home.  \n\nI think the real question is what kind of snacks they're going for and why. It's your food, and you have a right to say who gets what, but maybe find out why they are asking and if it's just for the snack appeal or if they're genuinely hungry. \n\nFor Example- I had a 10 kid weekend sleepover one year.  No one wanted my homemade enchiladas, and they picked at dinner.  Later, they cleaned me out on muffins, chips, brownies, etc. It gets annoying when they target the expensive and tasty snacks but don't want real food. These kids weren't hungry. They were snacky. Big big difference.", "I mean considering this isn\u2019t financially burdensome for you and these kids clearly don\u2019t have food at all why not just invite the family for a regular group dinner?

Watch how they interact with your child.", "Maybe ask yourself what you're willing to do/give/provide that would make you look back 5 years from now and say \"yeah, that was the right thing to do\".  \n\n\nSet some boundaries. Maybe have 'real talk\" with them. Let them know that you're happy to have them as neighbors and friends for your kids, but you want to have a real conversation about food. \"Hey - y'all come around here and I'm glad you're here, but I noticed that you've started asking my kids to sneak you food. We don't do that here. I don't want you to go hungry, so I made shelf for you in the pantry that you're welcome to, but I'm only going to stock it every 2 weeks, and only with X, Y & Z.  If you need something more than that, maybe we can work out an arrangement. What do you propose?\"  \n\n\nTalk it out. Put it all above board. Treat them with respect and hopefully they'll return it. If not, then it's a whole lot easier to cut off the free-for-all snacks.   \n\n\nUltimately, give them the opportunity to problem solve WITH you. Hopefully you're pleasantly surprised.
