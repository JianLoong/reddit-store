My mom and sister asked me when she's planning on going dress shopping and if she's made any appointments yet, so I asked her. She laughed and said there's absolutely no way she could go into a dress shop, but that she'd already contacted some dressmakers and was going to look at designs soon, but they could come to that. \n\nWhich, what? Completely custom dresses are stupid expensive, at least 5k. We didn't budget for that. She insisted she could and would pay for it herself, and that it was necessary. She thinks that it would be inappropriate for an \"older bride\" to go into dress shops in the first place, and to make matters worse, she's \"too big\" to have many options (dress size 12 or 14) so it would just be too humiliating to think about. To be 100% fair, I don't know how any of that works, but it's just a store. They want to make money and have to have options for people. How bad could it possibly be?\n\nI did ask my mom and sister. They've never seen anyone over the age of 30 get married, but they say that dress shopping is an important bonding activity for everyone, including my fianc\u00e9e's friends and family. My fianc\u00e9e is basing this off of experiences buying a prom dress over 15 years ago and one woman she saw once. I don't think it's realistic. Buying a custom dress is such a waste of money and it denies everyone an important experience. There's nothing shameful about buying a wedding dress at any age, and acting like it needs to be done in secret at all costs is really insulting. \n\nShe's adamant that she needs to do this and that none of us understand.

If I were talking to her right now, I would tell her to consider your response to this a definite red flag.", "YTA. She can have whatever dress she wants if she\u2019s paying for it.  Also, it\u2019s not normal for the groom\u2019s mother and sister to go dress shopping with the bride.", "YTA.  She is buying her own dress, herself, with her money.

She also seems to be hyper conscious about her body and can see why she really doesn't want a \"bonding experience\" with all her and maybe your relatives judging her. Check in with her about what negative comments her family have made about her body over the years - she is telling you this is experience will be humiliating to her but you are giving more weight to what your female relatives are saying about their experiences than her lived life.\n\nLet her get prices - they may be less than you think and if this is so important to her and she is willing to pay the price, then see if you can support the real reason she is worried.

Shouldn\u2019t what she wants (for the clothing she is going to wear) be what goes? Your mom can\u2019t take the place of her mom. Also bridal shops don\u2019t keep a lot of stock for bigger brides to try on. My best friend was only able to try on 4 dresses, she was very depressed and it killed here self esteem for awhile, is that the kind of thing you want to have her go through? She\u2019s not asking you to pay for it so why the heck are you even involved?", "YTA\n\nWhy is she expected to take the fiancees family dress shopping?!?!

Before I decided to have my dress made. They tried to,put me in crap,I looked terrible in because they only had 1 or 2 choices for larger women. \n\nIf it really is her money why do you care? And no it is NOT REQUIRED for a bride to,have a bonding g session with her in laws over a dress. \nThat said if it means some other important part of the wedding for you would,have to,be skimped on maybe talk with her about a less expensive option for a dress. I worked with a local.seamstress who,was able to get fabric at a discount and followed a pattern it was no more expensive than a decent wedding dress.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you guys have separate finances. Why on earth is it your business if she wants to splurge her own money on an expensive dress?\n\nAnd honestly, being \u201cbigger\u201d makes for terrible shopping experiences. In wedding dresses they run much larger as well. So if your fianc\u00e9e wears size 12 dresses normally, she could be around an 18 on wedding dresses.

Let the bride have the dress experience the bride wants, especially if the bride is paying for it. YTA", "YTA. It's her wedding. It's her dress. It's her money. Why does a bride owe an experience to the MoG and SoG that rids her of the experience that she wants and the dress that she wants to wear at her wedding? That is ridiculous. That tradition is about the bride and HER mother. Drop it now. If you get your way, she will resent you whenever she looks at her wedding photos.", "YTA. She is paying for it, it\u2019s her dress, it\u2019s her decision making process/experience, her personal preference, her comfortability\u2026. And you and your family think you have any say? This should be a red flag to her that you will try to control her and her decisions in your marriage.", "YTA- she's paying for it out of her own pocket. Her reasons for wanting a custom dress don't really matter, it's her money.  And while maybe it's a \"waste of money\" to YOU does not mean she has to feel the same.\n\nAs for the bonding experience over going to a dress store with your mom and sister, there are plenty of other alternative experiences that could provide bonding time, *if she wants that*. She shouldn't be pressured into going to a dress shop for just based on some societal notion that it is \"important bonding\" part of wedding customs. \n\n\nIf none of you understand her reasoning, that's okay- you don't need to, but you should still respect it.", "YTA. I don't personally understand it, but if that's what she wants to do and she's going to pay for it, then just let her be.

Important binding activity?  Ha!  What a load of crap.  It's her body, her dress, and HER choice.  Stay out of it.  This has NOTHING to do with your mom and sister.  They should butt out.", "YTA\n\nIt's her dress,  her money,  and her body.  Plus, you can walk into a shop and drop an insane amount of cash on a dress. You can also find a good designer and have a dress made in her budget.", "YTA -- it's no one's business but hers, and your mom and sister do not get a say in how she chooses a wedding dress. I do think it is absolutely not an issue being an older or heavier bride. If I get married, I will likely be in my 40s or very close to it. I won't be going to a bridal shop either, but that will be because I want to make my own dress. A bride I knew had her dress made by a dressmaker for cheaper than a similar dress would have cost. Plus, if a dressmaker is actually working off your measurements and fitting you along the process, you're saving on the fitting costs, which can be very very high too. I'm sure dress shopping is a nice bonding experience, that doesn't make it a requirement.", "35 is shamefully old? I feel depressed.", "YTA. You're mad that your family is being kept out of a process that your fiance has already said is embarrassing for her.

Maybe she'll take this to decide to dump your ass.", "YTA just because she is gonna pay for it on her own, so it shouldn\u2019t matter.

You go to the mall with friends and look at jewelry while they find cute outfits because nothing is in your size. Even if you find something in your size, the likelihood of it actually fitting or looking good on you is so low. You lose all self esteem because every store you step into is catered to people much smaller than you so there must be something inherently wrong with the body you\u2019ve ended up in. \n\nLet her get the custom dress so she feels beautiful on her special day. If she\u2019s paying for it and not dipping into the wedding budget then I don\u2019t understand the issue.", "YTA. \n\nShe is paying for the experience she wants when it comes to her dress. Presumably the wedding isn't about the bonding experience your mom wants. And not everyone wants all of that. I took two people. My DIL took two people.

It's her dress. She's paying for it herself.  Clearly let her enjoy the experience the way she wants and in a manner she's comfortable.", "I don\u2019t think you understand the cost of wedding dresses in general.. they are all really expensive and $5k for a custom made dress is not much more than a non-custom made dress. Many non-custom dresses actually cost much more than that (mine was $3,500, and it was the cheapest one in the store, which ended up needing to be adjusted anyway so it went up to $4,000). It\u2019s both of your special day, and this issue sounds like a really big deal for her. If she feels that insecure about shopping for a wedding dress, don\u2019t force her to go. It\u2019s obviously a sensitive issue for her and seems to be a much bigger deal for her than you\u2019re understanding. I think this would be an area you should maybe compromise and let her have her way. Every bride should feel beautiful and confident on her wedding day. It sound like this custom dress will help her with that. I understand wanting to save money, but her feelings also matter. YTA", "YTA\nA few points: \n\nDenying your mum and sister such an important experience? Are you being funny?! She doesn\u2019t owe them Jack all. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to go to a bridal shop.

Also a dressmaker can provide a very useful idea for what makes her feel more comfortable  and prettier, they point out your attributes. Let your fianc\u00e9e make her choose her dress drama free.", "YTA she isn\u2019t even excluding the family she said they are welcome to look at the designs.

You need to support this", "YTA\n\nShes paying for her dress is she not?", "Everybody wants to feel and look their best on their wedding if this is what\u2019s gonna make her feel her best which will make her look her best why would you wanna shame her for that? Also her reasonings are based around body image you should be reassuring that she is the beautiful person you see them as. 35 is not old!!! And she could call ahead to stores to see if they cater to her sizing. But I think she\u2019s completely in the more then okay and not secretive! To get a custom dress is such an experience well when I saw on gypsy sisters it looked like it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and you could ask if she be willing to have them at one of her fittings if you want that experience for your family so bad which is a really weird request. I guess when you care so much about what others think of you, you do weird things idk. Kinda the vibe I\u2019m getting. \nYTA", "YTA. Depending on the style ahe wants, it could be much cheaper. It sounds like she doesn't want to look like a princess or have the priness experience. That is perfectly understandable. Not everyone wants the \"say yes to the dress\" experience.", "YTA\nSoooo she\u2019s willing to pay for it herself, but it\u2019s more important to you that she does the classic \u201cgo to the shops with the female family members\u201d bit instead of letting her get the dress of her dreams and comfort made.\nSo you\u2019re a momma\u2019s boy, right? That why she can\u2019t get her own dress the way she wants? Because mommy wants to watch her play dress up at a bridal salon? \n\nDude, seriously.", "\u201cHow bad could it possibly be?\u201d\n\nHa\u2026.come talk to us when you\u2019ve tried going clothes shopping as a mid size/plus size woman. They absolutely do not have a good variety of options for us, ESPECIALLY in formal wear which already runs super small as is. So while she normally wears a 12/14, she\u2019d have to size up for wedding gowns and the higher you go the less options you have. Anything above an 18 is almost nonexistent. Also, dress shopping is only an important bonding experience if the bride wants it. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t, so your family shouldn\u2019t feel the need to impose themselves on her when it\u2019s not their wedding.\n\nSo yes, YTA. For CHOOSING to be ignorant and trusting what your family says over your soon to be wife.", "While I don\u2019t necessarily agree with her reasons, she should be able to have the dress she wants if she is paying for it herself. You don\u2019t need to police her choice of wedding dress.\n\nMild YTA, but you can still fix this. Apologize and support her in choosing something that will make her feel beautiful and special at the wedding.", "YTA.\n\nI debated saying E S H, because you are right that she definitely should have talked with you before deciding to get a custom dress, especially considering how expensive weddings are before you add the additional 5k at least to get a well made custom wedding dress.\n\nHaving said that, I can see why she doesn't want to go dress shopping. Dress shopping is already complicated for women when they're not as thin as society would like. When you factor in the culture around losing weight to fit a wedding dress and the way they're meant to fit a certain body type, it makes sense that the idea of having to go to a public store and struggle to find one she likes alarms her. And that's without even mentioning her insecurities about her age. Not only that, but even a non custom wedding dress will be expensive, so she may as well have one that will fit and make her happy.\n\nUltimately, I can see why your mom and sister feel like not going dress shopping is missing out on an important experience, but it's not about their experiences. It's about what your fianc\u00e9e wants, because shes the one getting married. If she doesn't want that part of the experience, that's her decision.", "YTA\n\nIf she can afford it and it makes her happy, it's not a waste of (**her**) money.", "YTA.

She\u2019s a 12-14, she wants the dress to fit and be flattering, and she doesn\u2019t want to be humiliated with an audience. The importance of this as a bonding experience is for your fianc\u00e9 to decide, not for your mother and sister to decide for her. She\u2019s agreed to have them accompany her to look at designs, but if she wants her dress to be made instead of ordered, it\u2019s her dress and she should get that option. And FYI, $5k is not overly expensive for a wedding dress, especially not a custom-made one. I bet she will look like a million bucks in a dress hand-made for her, at the bargain price of $5k.", "YTA. Not you, your mom, nor your sister gets to decide what makes her comfortable when picking out HER wedding dress. If she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable because of her age neither you, your mother, nor your sister gets to negate her feelings. She\u2019s 35 if she says she has the money to to purchase the dress she wants the way she wants back off. If this is unacceptable then call off the wedding and find someone who\u2019s willing to do things the way your mom says is acceptable.\n\nEdited for grammar.", "Wedding dresses are a huge deal, and I think the most important thing is that she is comfortable the day of the wedding. If she thinks she needs a custom dress to do that, it's at least worth researching. And not every custom dress is going to cost thousands of dollars, just like some off the rack dresses can cost in the low hundreds. I think you maybe need more information about what she's thinking? If she doesn't feel seen or heard on this issue you're going into a huge commitment with your wires crossed. Sit down and hear her out. Also, you can't force bonding experiences, and not every female is going to be into bringing a flock of people with them dress shopping. For me, it was just myself and my mom.

You note that *we* didn't budget for it, but that she could pay for it herself; is \"paying for it herself\" something that normally happens with your finances?\n\nThat drastically changes how much you can object to her wanting to spend a ton of unbudgeted money on additional wedding expenses.\n\nE: As far as the rest goes, though, your family wanting to invite themselves to her dress shopping is strange, but so his her logic for wanting to dodge the dress shops, but obviously what she wants matters more than what your family wants here.", "Soft YTA\n\nFor whatever reason, she\u2019s sensitive about her age.

My mom and sister asked me when she's planning on going dress shopping and if she's made any appointments yet, so I asked her. She laughed and said there's absolutely no way she could go into a dress shop, but that she'd already contacted some dressmakers and was going to look at designs soon, but they could come to that. \n\nWhich, what? Completely custom dresses are stupid expensive, at least 5k. We didn't budget for that. She insisted she could and would pay for it herself, and that it was necessary. She thinks that it would be inappropriate for an \"older bride\" to go into dress shops in the first place, and to make matters worse, she's \"too big\" to have many options (dress size 12 or 14) so it would just be too humiliating to think about. To be 100% fair, I don't know how any of that works, but it's just a store. They want to make money and have to have options for people. How bad could it possibly be?\n\nI did ask my mom and sister. They've never seen anyone over the age of 30 get married, but they say that dress shopping is an important bonding activity for everyone, including my fianc\u00e9e's friends and family. My fianc\u00e9e is basing this off of experiences buying a prom dress over 15 years ago and one woman she saw once. I don't think it's realistic. Buying a custom dress is such a waste of money and it denies everyone an important experience. There's nothing shameful about buying a wedding dress at any age, and acting like it needs to be done in secret at all costs is really insulting. \n\nShe's adamant that she needs to do this and that none of us understand.

Let the woman get the dress that she wants, she's covering it. I will say though that I mostly think your AH judgment is how you're going about it. Yes, wedding dress shopping can be a bonding experience for people, but it isn't a requirement. There are a lot of people who don't invite every family member who may want to be there, or who go alone, or go multiple times (third or fourth time around, I'm sure their invited family members aren't nearly as hyped about all of the \"bonding.\") There are plenty of other experiences your mom and sister can have with her, many of which will be more helpful than stressful. I'm sure she'd find it way more helpful to have them help her put together 20 centerpieces and 200 programs that just watching her in dresses. I mention this specifically because it sounds like your fiancee is self conscious about her weight. Knowing that, it's odd to me that you wouldn't get how it may feel for her to literally get up in front of people and have them assess how she looks, particularly when the stakes are so high (i.e. wedding) and when there will be strangers around as well, particularly if there are other, smaller, younger brides doing the same thing at the same time. \n\nFrom what you've said, it sounds like she had a terrible time finding a dress to go to prom and the idea of reliving that experience has her \"noping\" out of this one. I'd be a teeny concerned about that, only because that was probably about half her lifetime ago, but if that was your main concern--that she's depriving herself of potentially great experiences because of terrible ones she's had in the past--you seem to be going about it the wrong way. You admit you know nothing about it, but you seem very willing to ignore her reasons for doing this her way in favor of jumping on board with your mom and sister even though you won't be paying for it and you won't be the one feeling like they're on display against their will. If you approached her about it with the same tone you're using in your post this wasn't a loving gentle suggestion to remind her that things have changed in the past 17/18 years, but more of an exasperated scoffing at all of her worries.", "I feel like that's usually AFTER the wedding. Even in community property states, whatever you earn before marriage is separate property by law.", "No, but if you didn\u2019t live with your fianc\u00e9 before the wedding, the wedding is the first time when financial decisions need to be made as a union.

Are you in a culture that features child brides?", "well if your mom and sister have never seen someone over 30 get married (???), maybe she\u2019s picking up on vibes that makes her uncomfortable", "That\u2019s weird, she clearly has dome issues around age", "And you don\u2019t think that might contribute to why she doesn\u2019t want to go with YOUR mother to pick out a wedding dress? \n\nI can only imagine how emotional that would be, especially when she\u2019d already be emotional about her self image. \n\nAgain, should be a red flag to her that you\u2019ll extend more empathy to your family than her in this scenario.\n\nEdit to add: Holy F, OP hasn\u2019t taken a single second to think about his fianc\u00e9 first. Yeah, he didn\u2019t consider how the death of her mother would play into this. What\u2019s more bothersome to me is that instead of his first reaction to her insecurities being to assure her that she shouldn\u2019t feel insecure because she\u2019s perfect how she is, it was running to mommy and sis to whine and hear THEIR thoughts.", "And i wonder why she wouldnt want to go do the thing a bride would typically do with her mother.....", "Could that be part of the reason she wants to skip it? It might be hard to do an activity that she envisioned one day doing with her mother with other people", "Brides aren't responsible for providing your mother and family an \"experience\"", "And you are siding with your mother and sister instead of your fianc\u00e9e, the person you claim to love enough to spend the rest of your life with? YTA and you are too clueless to get married.", "I thought so, but I didn't want to write it. Perhaps, she doesn't want that experience with anyone but her own mother. This is the same as you telling her that your father is walking her down the aisle because her father is deceased. It's her loss and her decision on how she wants to handle it. I think you, your mother, and your sister need to back off, and respect her feelings and wants.", "My mom died before I was even close to getting married. \n\nI too skipped the dress shopping and ordered a dress custom made.", "That doesn't make YOUR mother HER mother. \n\nYTA", "Also true", "netherlands", "There tons of under a thousand dollar dresses in the world.  Tons.", "Nah you can get a dress from David\u2019s bridal or something for $400 easy. They have $99 and $199 sales all the time too!", "Oh absolutely! A wedding dress doesn't have to cost thousands to be beautiful and special. Mine was $300 at David's Bridal. (And it's super easy to customize an affordable dress with appliqu\u00e9s, etc.) If you're having it custom made by a local seamstress instead of a fancy wedding dress designer then there's no reason she can't pick a dress within her budget that makes her feel good. I feel like our guy here is making a lot of assumptions about what \"custom wedding dress\" means. Yes, it CAN mean thousands and thousands of dollars. But it doesn't have to.", "But the average weight of the average likely customer, and therefore OP's wife would a wide variety of options available to her in any store that wants to stay in business", "That\u2019s insane!! There\u2019s no reason not to carry 8-10 in stock. Although there\u2019s no reason to avoid other sizes too. Yeah, when I went shopping my thinner friends all had multiple dresses to try on and I found MAYBE 1-2 that weren\u2019t really my style and I had to get altered anyway. If someone wants to avoid that experience, more power to them!", "You say your mother and sister have said they\u2019ve never seen anyone over 30 get married. \nTo be your f feeling insecure about her age feels odd, but then I know loads of over 30s get married. \nIs she really the only one making a big deal about her age? If so where does your families comment come into it?", "I got married after 30. All that matters is that the BRIDE likes her dress.", "Let her do what she wants. Yta clearly.", "So, is your family making her feel insecure about her age?", "I have no idea what those are, is she insecure about her age?", "Exactly. I had a custom dress. The price included alterations, while bridal stores charge separately for those. Plus with off-the-rack dresses you need to buy the appropriate foundation undergarments, and my dress had a corset built into it, so I didn\u2019t need to buy anything extra.", "Yup. I had a fully bespoke wedding dress. I didn\u2019t cheap out on any of it, and had it made in a rush (3 months from engagement to wedding) and all in: fabric, buttons, bra cups, design, fittings and labour, it came to $1,600 or $1,700.", "Aaaand another one who tries to put words in my mouth...   \n\n\nI didn't say anything about her being an AH. I just find the budget of 5k for a dress, that will be worn only once, kind of ridiculous. If it's USA (which I asume it is), it's more than one month worth of average salary and I don't understand why would anyone do that. Now chill, it's just an opinion.", "I didn't say anything about giving anyone an experience, I just said spending 5k on a dress, which is going to be worn once, is something I don't understand, no matter who pays for it, and that I don't think OP is an AH just for not understanding the same thing. Please don't put words (or anything else) into my mouth.", "oh ffs... did I say she is the AH?", "In more standard dresses, I\u2019m a 12/14. In formal dresses, I start at 18 and then go up or down from there. The one time I tried on a wedding dress for fun a 22 didn\u2019t fit.", "That's because they are still in historical dress sizes. As people have gotten bigger, clothing manufacturers have adjusted their sizing accordingly because no one wants to admit they need a bigger number on the tag. It's called vanity sizing. All of my current size 6 clothes are bigger than the 10s and 12s I still have from 25 years ago.", "Most styles over a 16 are matronly. And if it was David\u2019s, their dresses are poor quality and often pretty boring. I\u2019ve worked in the wedding industry for 20 years, and options for older and non-traditional brides are ridiculously limited. I took a friend to Kleinfelds many hours away in 2021 just so she\u2019d have options in a size 22 that reflected her taste.", "Yeah, if you're not sure and marry the wrong person you end up posting on Reddit.", "Ikr. My parents dated for 10 years before getting married lol", "Right? And to be honest, I think few people should get married before 30. It\u2019s a lot of responsibility for someone too young.", "I really want to know where they're from if every woman around them is married before 30", "Yes, there will be many under $1,000 but the way the comment is written it reads like low hundreds is a high end price. Also, low hundreds is a _good_ price, but there won\u2019t be many that fit into that category unless you also consider $2,000 to still be \u201chundreds\u201d when comparing. \n\nOP is concerned about the cost of a handmade dress so the comment is that they can be cheaper. Just like off the rack can cost hundreds - meaning higher in price than he\u2019d be expecting. It would have made more sense to me to say \u201coff the rack can be in the low thousands\u201d indicating they can be more expensive than he may expect.", "I agree with you. But that isn't how she feels and I get why.", "Read his post again.  They are talking about how his fiancee is saying brides over 30 don't go to dress stores.  He asked his mom and sis was this actually a thing and their response was they never saw anyone over 30 married so they didn't know if it was or not.", "Alterations are really what makes custom dresses cheaper/the same price. I bought a dress from David's Bridal and alterations cost MORE than the dress.", "If you feel like both are neither the AH, then change your judgement to NAH (No a**holes here)", "Your ruling is N T A, which means that OP isn\u2019t an asshole but the other person is. Thus, you did indeed say she\u2019s an asshole. If you meant that neither of them is an asshole, the verdict for that is NAH, no assholes here. If you say something without understanding what it means, you don\u2019t get to get snippy when people who do understand call you out.", "NTA means the other person/people in the story is an asshole.", "Nobody's asking him to understand it. But his failure to understand doesn't justify forbidding her from spending her own money on the dress.", "$5k might be alot of money for you. It might not be for her.", "Um, yes? If you don\u2019t think either party is an asshole the ruling is NAH.", "I am a size zero and pretty sure my wedding dress was a size 10. So crazy. OP, YTA. Let her do it the way she wants, as long as it\u2019s not way out of your agreed budget.", "Good one!", "He asked if HE is an asshole. So NAH stands.", "Sorry that I got bit snippy because of people calling me out. English isn't my first language and I understood the voting system wrong. I'll change my vote (but it does change very little by now) and next time I'll go by the guidelines you laid here.", "From what is written in the post, I don't think he told her she is forbidden from buying it. I gained an impression that they just discussed it and the guy doesn't understand it and tried to talk about it with other people, but it never went the path of \"I forbid you to buy custom dress\". More like \"I really don't see a good reason to spent so much money on a once-to-wear dress and I really think you should reconsider it\".", "That is true but even if she has big savings and/or very well paid job, 5k is still way too much to pay for something that is going to be worn once and then hang in closet until clothing moths eat it.", "He asked if HE is an asshole. Not if his fianc\u00e9 is an AH.", "I\u2019m a size 2 and I had to wear a 12 in my wedding dress and a few bridesmaid dresses.", "His title literally asks about telling her she can't buy it.", "That\u2019s your opinion. Folks pay $5k for a one night stay in a luxury hotel. For a private jet from LA to San Francisco. For a superbowl ticket. I wouldn\u2019t spent $5k on it, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you would either, but we don\u2019t get to make value decisions for other people. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something you\u2019ve bought that I would think wasn\u2019t worth it.", "Buddy, read the rules of the sub before you keep embarrassing yourself. NTA means you\u2019re not the asshole and the other person is. YTA is you\u2019re the asshole, they aren\u2019t. NAH is no assholes here."]}
