You might have paid for some, you might have won some, you might have even received some as presents. There are memories in each figure you buy for your collection. What you want to do with YOUR collection is up to you and only you. No one else\u2019s \n\nStay strong King", "What did she do with all of your items? You need to talk to her maybe you can somehow get it back", "Omg she actually threw them out!? \n\nDude NTA at all. Your wife is a massive fkn AH. I'm actually so mad for you.. wth!?\n\nI'm 30 too and my husband and I are massive nerds and have collectables and I would be so upset if they were thrown out without my permission. We have a bunch of friends our age who also have lots of collectibles and it's so frustrating when people say it's childish. Adults are allowed to have interests and collect things.\n\nShe should have asked if you could buy a proper display cabinet or something if she wanted to declutter - not just thow them out!", "NTA, she demands you prioritize your relationship together over toys but throwing them away without so much as having a discussion about it beforehand proves that she isn't prioritizing your feelings, much less your belongings.  \n\n\nI'm sorry you lost your collection and I hope you're able to get it back. There is clearly more going on here, you and your wife should really consider counseling.", "NTA. Your so called \"wife\" doesn't respect your belongings, so it's clear you did the right thing. \n\nYour collection may seem like \"toys\". But as long as they aren't dusty, your wife and other folks need to respect your collection.", "Nta. She had no right to. I'm curious how much of her stuff was tossed in comparison to yours?", "NTA. People in relationships don't get to make unilateral decisions like this. If she wants to throw all of her things out, that's fine.", "I swear this is a repost", "NTA. I'm 65 and still have some of my collections. I feel your pain.", "i aint a killer but dont push me", "NTA this is an extremely controlling thing for her to have done, and the fact that she won\u2019t apologize or be understanding is ridiculous.", "NTA. Idk why it\u2019s so hard to understand. If it\u2019s not yours don\u2019t touch it without permission. I hope they weren\u2019t thrown away and are just in storage. I do think though maybe people are divided because you yelled. I also know if people don\u2019t understand or care about your hobbies they think it\u2019s unimportant. Kind of like a parent telling a kid the video game doesn\u2019t matter. Yeah maybe not to them but to the kid it does. So maybe try and sit down with your wife and explain why there important after everything calms down. If she still doesn\u2019t get it then then that\u2019s bad news", "INFO like how much of the house was filled with funko pops?", "Nta. I put all my collectables and pops into storage crates with silica gel packets. It's not that hard to store away and declutter. Does your wife have a gambling/drug problem? Did she sell them and just say she threw them?", "You\u2019re not the asshole, but they were funko pops", "ESH, though I feel like there may be some relevant backstory not shown here.  Wife is an AH because she should not have thrown away stuff she had to know OP valued without a conversation.  Even with consent, attempting to sell the stuff would have been a much better choice.\n\nOP is co-AH (but less so) because screaming \"directly in\" someone's face isn't a great reaction. Yeah, OP was entitled to their rage here but that action was over the top.  Again, I'm left to wonder that there's more to this dynamic than just decluttering.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Throughout my life, I've amassed an impressive collection of action figures, comic books, and other memorabilia. It's something that brings me a lot of joy and nostalgia. My most prized collection, however, are my Funko Pops, mostly Star Wars and Marvel. For context, friends from Pop forums had estimated the value of my collection at over $2000.\nRecently, my wife (30F) decided to declutter our house. I understand the need to keep things organized, but I never expected her to take it to such an extreme. She went through every room, tossing out things she deemed unnecessary or outdated without consulting me first.\nI came home from work one day to find that my precious Funko collection was gone. I couldn't believe my eyes. It felt like a part of me had been ripped away. When I confronted my wife, she said she thought they were just \"dusty old toys\" and that I should grow up.\nI was furious. How could she not understand the sentimental value of these items? They represented my childhood and my passion for pop culture. It wasn't about being immature; it was about cherishing the memories associated with those Pops.\nWe had a huge argument, with her defending her actions and me feeling hurt and betrayed. I told her she had no right to throw away things that meant so much to me without even discussing it with me first. She accused me of being overly attached to material possessions and said I needed to prioritize our relationship over \"silly toys.\"\nNow, our friends and family are divided. Some of them say I'm overreacting and should let it go, while others believe my wife was insensitive and should have considered my feelings. I can't help but feel like my wife crossed a line by not valuing something that brought me so much joy.\nSo, Reddit, AITA for getting upset at my wife for throwing out my prized collection?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Should you have screamed in her face yea probably not but she deserved it she invalidated your feelings and didn\u2019t give af about what she did .

But it can only be done with the agreement and cooperation of the owner of said collections.\n\nDeciding to throw out someone else's possessions without any warning or discussion is a huge asshole move, and says something towards a person's entitlement and attitude towards others.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re yours and you have a right to make decisions about them.  She should have put them in a box and asked if she could toss them if she was just decluttering.

You are NOT overreacting Go throw her shit out. like all her makeup or something. actually throw her shit out on the lawn", "NTA - blithely throwing out stuff that isn't yours without any sort of consultation is a very bad move. I made this mistake once with things that looked like actual rubbish (stained coasters which had not been used in the four years we've been together, a crumpled up, dust-covered mousemat half wedged under the couch etc) and my partner went BALLISTIC.

Does she need money for something and is lying?", "NTA she should have piled your stuff until you came home to double check and approve what to throw away. Can you get the stuff back from the recycle bin?", "Her throwing out old magazines is not equivalent. She threw away things she was done with and didn\u2019t care about. In throwing out your Funko collection, she threw away things you weren\u2019t \u201cdone with\u201d and do care about.\n\n I\u2019m gonna say ESH, because you screaming in her face was out of line, but I see why you did it. She was a major AH for throwing away your stuff without checking with you first. \n\nINFO, does she have issues with your pop culture hobbies generally? Like she feels like you don\u2019t show her enough attention because you\u2019re doing hobby things?  Does she make a lot of decisions about your shared space or your relationship without talking to you about it? Does she try to \u201dchange\u201d you into a partner she can show off to her friends or that matches whatever aesthetic she\u2019s into? All of those kinds of things speak to there being much deeper issues in your relationship that you probably want to work on to make a healthier relationship."]}
