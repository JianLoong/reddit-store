They continuously, despite admittedly having no reason to, voted me and I would continuously lose first round. This made the game virtually impossible for me to play. I asked them to stop, but even with a round or two of asking, they ignored me.

I tell them a couple times, \"Hey, I might grab my Switch and play Pok\u00e9mon.\" And they all ignored me. After eating, I ended up following through and grabbing my Switch. I go downstairs to play, Sb goes upstairs to his room, Ob and Bff follow me downstairs after a bit to Ob's room, which is right beside mine. I didn't think anybody was mad, because Ob and Bff immediately sounded like they found something to do.\n\nLater I go into Ob's room because through the wall I heard the sounds of him and Bff playing a Star Wars game. I didn't know which, so I asked \"Hey, what game are you guys playing?\" To which Bff ignored me and Ob replied \"I dunno, we could be playing Jackbox.\" and then kicked me out of his room after no other interaction. All the while Bff just sat there and agreed with kicking me out. I went back upstairs. \n\nAfter about half an hour, Bff comes upstairs to grab a snack and I ask him why Ob is mad. \"For a good reason.\" To which I followed Bff into the garage to ask why. \"You took the Switch away to play Pok\u00e9mon, which you never do.\" I reply with \"Because I felt unwelcome playing with you guys after you literally stopped me from playing the game, and I wanted to play MY Switch\" he replies with \"Then tell us to stop and we would have! Feeling unwelcome is a stupid excuse, try not being a little bitch.\" and after a bit more of yelling back and forth, we dispersed and he went downstairs and I stayed upstairs for the next hour or so before I went downstairs to sleep. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689516835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1517byu/aita_for_taking_my_switch_after_being_driven_away/", "score": 387, "replies": ["YTA to yourself for continuing to stay friends with these people. i get the feeling something like this has happened before.", "NTA. You BFF is not a BFF. They purposely excluded you and then treated you like dirt. You gave them more than enough warning and tried to be included, but they snubbed you. They are certainly TAH. They value that Switch more than they value you, and that's pretty disgusting behaviour. Especially from a BFF. I say drop them tbh.\n\nEdit: that Switch is yours. It belongs to you and not to them. They are not entitled to it ever, and they need to grow up.", "NTA. They kept excluding you and made mutual enjoyment impossible. You took the device to play with after a couple more HOURS - not a few minutes later in some retaliatory strike, though I can certainly see that element.

Sure as hell not BF.", "NTA. Every one of them was bullying you, and then tried to act like it was your fault for being bullied.", "NTA. You asked them to stop, and they didn't. Then you let them play on your Switch for a while. You don't treat the owner of anything like that and still expect to be able to use it. That goes for a switch, pool, a boat, or anything.", "Somebody that acts like that when other people are around aren\u2019t your friend.", "If that guy is \\*\\*your\\*\\* \"bff\" you definitely need a better class of friends.  He seemed far more interested in your brothers.\n\nNTA", "Honestly, I would not let them use the switch anymore. Actions have consequences, and bullying the owner of a game system means you don't have access to that game system.\n\nAnd please raise your standards for friends. I bet if you think about it, you will remember many other instances of his cruel behavior targeting you.\n\nI would also consider having a chat with your brother in law about what happened. He is old enough to know that behavior is wrong. He will probably say it was just game playing trash talking, but you repeatedly asked everyone to stop. \n\nNTA and please get better friends.", "ESH.

Stop hanging out with them. You're only going to be bullied.", "NTA.\n\nBut you need new friends.", "NTA, this is just one of those \"kids being kids\" times. Who knows why they acted like that. You were right to put an end to them targetting you.\n\nI was in a similar situation years ago with my Gamecube. I had brought smash bros and 3 controllers over to a buddy's house with 1 mutual and 1 I didn't know. 4 people total. For hours I was given the shit end of the stick with them ganging up and putting me out first, then fighting normally.

A partner that does the sort of stuff OP decribes does not sound to be a keeper.\n\nBF sounds to be good friends with the sibs though. So dumping him, again, probably won't stop the exposure to his bad behavior.", "Why? She told them several times to stop, and gave them a warning she was going to take it. They were incredibly disrespectful. I would have taken my switch and left. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Yes, they do, given their natural ages... that doesn't make this ESH.", "Sorry, completely fucked that up.

Both are being assholes.", "NTA\nIf these people are treating you like this, they aren't real friends. Real friends would treat you better than this.

Bring it up to you bff and gage his reaction if you want to continue being friends. He shouldn\u2019t be putting you down to look cool to your brother.", "NTA\n\nI had people like this before in my life, people I thought were my friends. They weren't, they only needed me around for something I had. In your case, it's the Switch. They have bullied you out of playing with them on your Switch, then get all defensive when they can no longer play with the handheld. \n\nLeast  you can still call him a BFF, but with the new meaning - Bully, Former Friend.", "Fuck them both. You keep that switch away from them now. They are the A.", "NTA.\n\nThis story gave me flashbacks. I had that same friend and same older sibling, only we're all girls. My friend was never really my friend, and my sister hates me. Turns out they are both sort of selfish sociopaths that likes to make others feel like shit, so they can feel special. I'm 40 yrs old now, and it doesn't get better. \n\nGet rid of that \"friend\", and distance yourself from your brother, so you make new friends he won't influence against you.", "NTA they were bullying you and had no desire to stop.

Let them pout, they're not your friends", "You deserve better then that.", "I'm sorry this happened to you buddy. \n\nSomething important to know about boundaries is that they are the keys to the doors needed to protect your peace. Your boundary was if they treat you like shit you're gonna play with your stuff alone. They didn't accept the key and basically threw shit at the door.\n\nDo not welcome them back. \n\nI know it's hard but when you set boundaries for yourself these people will no longer be able to hurt you because they won't use the keys you give them and you trust yourself to keep those doors locked with you safe inside.\n\nIf you're looking for new friends I recommend finding a near by climbing gym! The climbing community is lovely and you can \"boulder\" by yourself. Sometimes you can swing a free membership by working for like an hour a week, or you could explain the situation and ask your parents if they can afford a membership.\n\nNTA and good luck! Awesome job setting a boundary, keep it up and find a better community!", "NTA. Absolutely using you for your switch. I would find better people to play with.", "This. Don't bother hanging with people who are abusive, even if you wish they weren't. They have to want to treat you better before it will have any effect and ignoring it isn't going to make that happen. If they're family, that means avoiding interaction whenever possible. It sucks, but if they can't treat you well, you're only harming yourself to try. The BFF, sucks even more. They may be the type who is easily influenced by the group particularly if they fear being abused themselves, but that's not ok and they owe you an apology and a definitive change of attitude before you even consider continuing the friendship.", "Your bff sounds like your bully.", "Weirdest description of BFF I've read in a while.\n\n>I asked them to stop, but even with a round or two of asking, they ignored me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Then tell us to stop and we would have! \n\nThats a lie.", "Please, please, please... Tell me you did not have to actually google that. If so, that makes me feel realy really old... also NTA. My kids are 10 and 11 and they have a friend that jumps between them pitting one against the other like you \"BFF\" and I hate to watch it. It is not good for you and your brothers. Just saying.v"]}
