I tell them a couple times, \"Hey, I might grab my Switch and play Pok\u00e9mon.\" And they all ignored me. After eating, I ended up following through and grabbing my Switch.

I didn't think anybody was mad, because Ob and Bff immediately sounded like they found something to do.\n\nLater I go into Ob's room because through the wall I heard the sounds of him and Bff playing a Star Wars game. I didn't know which, so I asked \"Hey, what game are you guys playing?\" To which Bff ignored me and Ob replied \"I dunno, we could be playing Jackbox.\" and then kicked me out of his room after no other interaction.

Feeling unwelcome is a stupid excuse, try not being a little bitch.\" and after a bit more of yelling back and forth, we dispersed and he went downstairs and I stayed upstairs for the next hour or so before I went downstairs to sleep. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689516835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1517byu/aita_for_taking_my_switch_after_being_driven_away/", "score": 106, "replies": ["YTA to yourself for continuing to stay friends with these people. i get the feeling something like this has happened before.", "NTA. You BFF is not a BFF. They purposely excluded you and then treated you like dirt. You gave them more than enough warning and tried to be included, but they snubbed you. They are certainly TAH. They value that Switch more than they value you, and that's pretty disgusting behaviour. Especially from a BFF. I say drop them tbh.\n\nEdit: that Switch is yours. It belongs to you and not to them. They are not entitled to it ever, and they need to grow up.", "NTA. They kept excluding you and made mutual enjoyment impossible. You took the device to play with after a couple more HOURS - not a few minutes later in some retaliatory strike, though I can certainly see that element. Then they ignored you further, kicked you out of a room, and told you what you'd done wrong... \n\nNone so blind as those who will not see, I guess.\n\nAnd your BFF? So not any kind of F. Sure as hell not BF.", "NTA. Every one of them was bullying you, and then tried to act like it was your fault for being bullied.", "NTA. You asked them to stop, and they didn't. Then you let them play on your Switch for a while. You don't treat the owner of anything like that and still expect to be able to use it. That goes for a switch, pool, a boat, or anything.", "Somebody that acts like that when other people are around aren\u2019t your friend.", "If that guy is \\*\\*your\\*\\* \"bff\" you definitely need a better class of friends.  He seemed far more interested in your brothers.\n\nNTA", "Honestly, I would not let them use the switch anymore. Actions have consequences, and bullying the owner of a game system means you don't have access to that game system.\n\nAnd please raise your standards for friends. I bet if you think about it, you will remember many other instances of his cruel behavior targeting you.\n\nI would also consider having a chat with your brother in law about what happened. He is old enough to know that behavior is wrong. He will probably say it was just game playing trash talking, but you repeatedly asked everyone to stop. \n\nNTA and please get better friends.", "ESH.

Stop hanging out with them. You're only going to be bullied.", "NTA.\n\nBut you need new friends.", "NTA, this is just one of those \"kids being kids\" times. Who knows why they acted like that. You were right to put an end to them targetting you.\n\nI was in a similar situation years ago with my Gamecube. I had brought smash bros and 3 controllers over to a buddy's house with 1 mutual and 1 I didn't know. 4 people total. For hours I was given the shit end of the stick with them ganging up and putting me out first, then fighting normally.

They're OPs sibling and step-sibling.\n\nOP can (and should) choose to not hang out with them. But OP will still have to live with them. They will still be exposed to some level of the rude and disrespectful behavior no matter what.\n\nDumping the BF would not be a bad idea. A partner that does the sort of stuff OP decribes does not sound to be a keeper.\n\nBF sounds to be good friends with the sibs though.
