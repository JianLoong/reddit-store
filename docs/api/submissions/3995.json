My friends gf Hilary was the most pushy, she wanted 3 for her upcoming trip. I\u2019m not good with saying no but I said \u201cI plan on keeping them, I already have plans for each one :)!\u201d\n\nWhich was true, I had already planned what I\u2019d do with the cameras, use 2 as a gift for my works white elephant game,give 2 to my cousin and his fianc\u00e9 for their wedding, gave 2 to my sister and 1 to my parents to share and kept 3 for myself so I can use during my travels next year. \n\nWhen I repeated my intent around keeping the cameras, most of then backed off, but the tone of the group chat changed. My friend told me that Hilary was very upset that I was not offering them to her and they brought up the fact that they\u2019re very good friends to me and do so many favours. They asked me to reconsider my plans for distribution.\n\nI\u2019ve been recently learning about boundaries in therapy so I feel like me doing what I did wasn\u2019t wrong, but now I\u2019m second guessing whether or not I should have included my friends in the distribution of cameras.

NTA at all. Sounds like the friend group might just be USED to you being pushed around. Absolutely hold this boundary. \n\nIf, at the end of the day, it effects your friendships remember that a *free disposable camera* could effect your friendships. And If that\u2019s the case, rethink the quality/priorities of the people you keep close to you. \n\nI imagine your guilt radar is quite off and you could feel guilt far sooner than most others. It is not a dick move. I imagine if your friends told you about them winning cameras, you\u2019d be happy for them with no sense of entitlement to their property. \n\n\n\nThere are unhealthy people everywhere. What about us allows them, or their relationship patterns to stay?", "NTA, it's a dispo camera they aren't some hot tickets can't get one item you are hoarding like a proverbial dragon", "Your friends sound very entitled. The cameras are yours and you do what you want with them, no need for the slightest bit of guilt on your part. NTA!", "NTA. If you won $1,000,000 they'd be asking you for $100k. Except for Hilary who'd ask for $300k.", "NTA. They sound a bit greedy.", "NTA! Even if you had no plans for using the cameras no one else has any rights to them.", "NTA, your friends sound super entitled to your things. I would look into other areas of your friendship and make sure your boundaries are solid there too.", "NTA. Set your boundaries and tell your friends to respect them.", "NTA - if you get a bonus or holiday gift from work are you expected to give it up to them?\n\nAn academic award which comes with a cash prize?\n\nMoney your grandmother puts in a birthday card?\n\nIf your friends are so used to you just doing what they want, that they feel they have a right to what isn't theirs, then it's time to consider the value of these friendships. I mean that from the perspective of 'how do we enrich one another's lives when there is no expectation of an exchange of goods?'.. And if you can't answer that with hard examples of mutual friendships being emotionally and intellectually reciprocal, do consider whether or not the friendship is helping or harming you.\n\nWhen something as simple as winning a few point and shoot disposable cameras has the ability to *negatively affect a friendship*, that's not something to take lightly.\n\nI'll go as far as to argue that what you said isn't even setting a boundary within a normally functioning framework; people only make absurd demands like this when they are accustomed to using someone, but *the default position is to be happy for you and not expect anything, except for maybe asking to see pics of your travels when you get back. That's the baseline normal.* If you had to 'set a boundary' that something which belongs to you is not free extra for them, that's genuinely unhealthy and not on your behalf, but on theirs.\n\nAbsolutely NTA and I'm proud of you for saying no. I do understand how difficult it is to learn to just, say no. But once you get the hang of it, it gets easier, and the people who don't like being told no weed themselves out all on their own. Keep it up. And again, there's no planet on which you could be the asshole here- heck, you aren't even keeping the things! You ARE redistributing them. Learning to not let your generosity get taken advantage of is so, so big. Hold that line, keep saying no to social vampires.\n\nEditing to add: *It does impact you though, even if they were \"free\", because you've made decisions regarding what they are to be used for. Having other people attempt to take away your autonomy through coercion, peer pressure, and guilt, even over something so small, absolutely does affect you.* Saying no to unreasonable demands isn't inconsiderate, their behaviour is.", "NTA at all", "NTA - You already decided what you would with YOUR property. Stick to your plans.", "Ok I gotta say. They still make disposable cameras?! Cause I have a bunch I want processed but everywhere I call laughs at me for asking.", "Nta. \n\nFriends do things for each other. They shouldn't build up a tab on you and then demand something sparkly that comes along when it meets their fancy.  They're fun savers ffs. I have lots of neat photos from my youth developed from those but, they're definitely an acquired taste now. Hold fast, they're yours and you do what you please", "NTA. That friend group sounds low-key toxic if they instantly feel entitled to something you have. Best of Luck.", "NTA. Those cameras are yours to do whatever you want with them. Hillary is behaving like an ass. \n\nAnd you should be able to share nice things that happen to you with your friends so you weren't wrong for doing that either.", "NTA - you can do what you want with your winnings. Even if you wanted to put them all under your bed in a shoebox forever, it\u2019s your prerogative. I think the only way you could be considered any bit an a here would be if Hilary had paid for your raffle ticket, and even then, this is so \u201clow value\u201d that it really shouldn\u2019t beget begging or jealousy.", "NTA. They can buy their own film cameras (I didn\u2019t know those were still a thing).", "NTA\n\nThey don't sound like very good friends, and it doesn't sound to me like they do that many favours compared to what you do for them.  It sounds a bit like they take you for granted.\n\nI think it's entirely reasonable to give them to your family members over your friends.  For the white elephant party, I think you need to take a couple of pictures first before putting those into the pool....", "NTA \n\nKeep saying no!\n\nYour friends aren\u2019t entitled to your winnings", "NTA they don't sound like great friends", "They are not your friends leave them as fast as you can. Not ASH", "NTA, if you win the lottery these are the people you should not tell", "Real friends would be happy for you for winning them. It's really tacky to ask for something you were not offered.\n\nBut I usually think that asking something is not wrong. Not accepting a \"no\" is when one becomes an asshole. Of course it depends on the situation though.\n\nIn here, it was really entitled to ask for three cameras, clearly expecting to get them. \n\nThe polite way to ask would have been \"Do you have plans for all of them. If not, could I have or buy one?\" That gives you a way to say no without having to sound \"mean\" about it. And honestly, just ask privately, not in a group chat where there would be group pressure to give in.\n\nI was proposed to in public. Hated it, didn't have the courage to say no as I was very shy back then. That relationship didn't last long after that, as they clearly didn't know me (or care about me) enough. I took that lesson, and don't like asking for anything unless it's privately.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
