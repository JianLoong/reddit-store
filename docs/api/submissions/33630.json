She was a young g stray in poor condition when I found her, and I befriended her and nursed her back to health. She is strictly an indoor cat, and I take every precaution to make sure she never escapes the house, for obvious reasons. We do go on walks with a harness and leash though. I had a cat sitter watch her while I was out of town for Thanksgiving, and she wasn\u2019t as cautious as I am. Ellie got out while she was bringing in a package. I was very upset, but her collar has contact info, and I posted to an online forum for my neighborhood about Ellie. I felt confident that someone would come forward with information soon.\n\n2 weeks ago, I got a message from a neighbor who claims he saw my cat at another neighbor\u2019s (40s F) house down the road. I went to visit the woman, and when I pulled in I saw Ellie sitting in the window. I knocked on the door and told the woman that I think she has my cat, and she said she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I told her the cat in the window was mine and showed her pictures of Ellie. She was even still wearing the collar I bought her. The woman insisted she got the cat from a shelter a couple months ago and that she was going to be a gift for her 12 year old daughter who she rarely sees. I told her that\u2019s not possible, Ellie is my cat, and she escaped two weeks ago. The woman told me that I shouldn\u2019t have been such an irresponsible owner and that I needed to leave or she\u2019d call the cops.\n\nI decided to make it easy on her and called them myself. When they arrived, she became hysterical and started trying to accuse ME of stealing Ellie and saying she\u2019d just gotten her back, but I had pictures in my phone, and on social media going back years, and some of her vet records. Needless to say, the police found the situation in my favor and she was told that she could either turn the cat over or be arrested, which sent her into hysterics again because she\u2019s apparently on parole. She THREW Ellie at me and slammed the door. Since this, she\u2019s been frazzled and skittish, but it\u2019s getting better. We\u2019re going to have a quiet Christmas at home instead of me traveling and getting a sitter.\n\nThe police asked if I wanted to press charges, and I ended up deciding to. She was later arrested for theft of property and harassment as she\u2019d gotten my phone number and began harassing me nonstop, saying I was ruining her life and her baby\u2019s Christmas. I have since gotten calls from her sister, claiming I\u2019m a heartless btch for ruining her niece\u2019s Christmas and putting her sister in jail.

My mom owns the corn and soybean fields nearby. At any rate, neighbor lady literally answered the door cradling my mom's missing kitty.

She was grateful to see ***ME***. \ud83e\udd23)\n\nSo, the horrible neighbor lady was not happy with me. And I still don't give a fork. I suggested she call the sheriff's department and have me dealt with. No way she was making that call.

You did what you had to do and your neighbor can kick rocks. Good for you.", "Not the asshole in a million years my dear and in fact I think you handled the whole thing with remarkable restraint. If someone tried to steal my precious boy the minute I saw him in the window I would have tackled that dirtbag, charged in and grabbed my Baby.

Put her in a cat carrier and have her chipped AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n\nThe fact that she's been outside on her own now, means she will be trying it again. And too many people's cats turn up in shelters unnecessarily simply because the owners were either too poor, too lazy, too full of themselves (no way I would let my cat slip out) or making up excuses to not get their cat chipped.\n\nBe better. Your cat deserves to get chipped. Not when she's calm, not when she feels good, but as soon as you can get an appointment.\n\nSorry if I came across as blunt, but it's irresponsible to not chip your cats (or dogs).", "NTA.

Have you checked with your local animal shelter or rescues for getting your cat chipped? I find it odd that your local vets don't do chipping.", "NTA.

You saved that cat now 2 times and at least for me it is totally understandable to stay with her.", "NTA.  As everyone in this story learned, legally animals are property.  Your neighbor stole your property, you reported it to the police, and appropriate action was taken.  She ruined her own family's Christmas by being a now convicted thief and harrasser.", "NTA!\n\nThat \"pet\" is your family! How would they feel if someone stole their baby??? Ummmmmm hello kidnapping and all that!\n\nIt's no different. She shouldn't have stole your cat and then she would have christmas wouldn't she?", "NTA. Their actions, their consequences", "NTA\n\nShe knowingly stole your cat. Pets are considered property. She committed a crime.", "NTA but please get her microchipped! Having a microchip radically increases the chances of an animal being united with their guardian should they escape \u2014 even if she slips her collar (or it's deliberately removed), she can still be identified at a shelter or vet's office, and if there's a future dispute like this your status as the registered owner will resolve it!", "NTA, and eff anyone who uses the phrase \u201cjust a pet\u201d", "Definitely NTA..

Thank you for being a great cat owner", "NTA I'm normally very against calling the cops but it doesn't seem like she left you with much choice here. This also seems like a pattern of behaviour for her. \n\nI hope you and Ellie are feeling better now and have a quiet and relaxing holiday", "NTA, the woman had a chance to do the right thing in the first place and give her back.
