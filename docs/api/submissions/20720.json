They have the entire basement to themselves, with the exception of my laundry area. They pay $450 a month to be here and 9/10 they eat their meals with us as well (they chip in very little to food cost however). They ran in to hard times and needed somewhere to go 2 months ago and we opened our doors to them, despite me being ready to \"pop\". I had my daughter 2 weeks ago. \n\nSince they moved in, my SIL will sleep all day (she works overnight shifts) and my BIL will come upstairs to my living room around 5-6am and take over the entire space. He will put TV on and then sit there with his laptop playing video games and he will not leave that living room at all until 8-9pm. My SIL even brings his food to him in the living room. The only time he gets up is to go to the bathroom or get himself coffee. Now, he's very much so a 50's style southern boy. This man does not lift a finger at all and has never so much as boiled water because that's a woman's job. He doesn't pull that shit with me but he does when it comes to my SIL (who works all day when he is unemployed due to a \"back injury\"). \n\nAnyways, I breastfeed my daughter and I refuse to be limited on my own space so I will absolutely go in to the living room and nurse my child. I make sure I'm not exposed. Damn near every time I go to nurse, he will be like \"ion wanna see dat shit\" (think southern hillbilly accent) or when my husband gets home he will say \"she tryna whip her boobies out in my face 'gain\". And I'm honestly so fed up and disgusted with him that I snapped and told him he's not welcome in my living room at all anymore and he can sit his stupid ass down in the area his wife pays for. SIL is trying to get me to change his mind because they don't have a TV down there and the plug in doesn't reach his laptop and sitting on the bed all day hurts his back but I refuse. I don't care how much discomfort it causes him. He grosses me out and his face makes me want to vomit and he needs to stay away from me completely. My husband is on my side, per usual.

Tell SIL to find a new place to live ASAP.", "NTA \n\nYour house, your rules. They rent the basement so he has no business taking over your living room. \n\nGive them an end date, say 3-6 months from now. They're taking advantage of you and your plate is full. \n\nSpeaking of plates, tell him that food isn't allowed in your living room, that all meals must be eaten in the kitchen. That's the rule in my house. No crumbs or spills on my couch or floors! He sounds like he won't clean it up and you'd have to do it.", "NTA. They don't rent your whole house.

They have full access to the basement since they pay for it. They can have access to the rest of the house, but keep in mind that, out of the basement, they are a GUEST and they are expected to act like one. They don't get to act like they own the space when they are outside of the basement. They don't get to complain about what the owners are doing outside of the basement.\n\nFeel bad for the SIL since the guy sounds like a complete jerk and this essentially punishes her at the same time.

What stands out for me, though, is that your BIL has been crossing a boundary by using the living room to his heart's content, and he's also been insulting/saying inappropriate thing's to you, yet you've never called him on his s**t. Why? Why wait and wait, letting it all build up until you go to an extreme place and forbid him to be in the LR?\n\nMoving forward, I encourage you to say something when BIL does/says something out of bounds: \"Dude! What you just said? It's inappropriate, so knock it off.\" \n\nMaybe a little too direct? \ud83d\ude00\n\nAlso, you may have talked to them about this already, but do they have a plan to move out anytime in the near future? If not, I think that needs to happen.
