They have the entire basement to themselves, with the exception of my laundry area. They pay $450 a month to be here and 9/10 they eat their meals with us as well (they chip in very little to food cost however). They ran in to hard times and needed somewhere to go 2 months ago and we opened our doors to them, despite me being ready to \"pop\". I had my daughter 2 weeks ago. \n\nSince they moved in, my SIL will sleep all day (she works overnight shifts) and my BIL will come upstairs to my living room around 5-6am and take over the entire space. He will put TV on and then sit there with his laptop playing video games and he will not leave that living room at all until 8-9pm. My SIL even brings his food to him in the living room. The only time he gets up is to go to the bathroom or get himself coffee. Now, he's very much so a 50's style southern boy. This man does not lift a finger at all and has never so much as boiled water because that's a woman's job. He doesn't pull that shit with me but he does when it comes to my SIL (who works all day when he is unemployed due to a \"back injury\"). \n\nAnyways, I breastfeed my daughter and I refuse to be limited on my own space so I will absolutely go in to the living room and nurse my child. I make sure I'm not exposed. Damn near every time I go to nurse, he will be like \"ion wanna see dat shit\" (think southern hillbilly accent) or when my husband gets home he will say \"she tryna whip her boobies out in my face 'gain\". And I'm honestly so fed up and disgusted with him that I snapped and told him he's not welcome in my living room at all anymore and he can sit his stupid ass down in the area his wife pays for. SIL is trying to get me to change his mind because they don't have a TV down there and the plug in doesn't reach his laptop and sitting on the bed all day hurts his back but I refuse. I don't care how much discomfort it causes him. He grosses me out and his face makes me want to vomit and he needs to stay away from me completely. My husband is on my side, per usual. But it's causing issues for my SIL because her husband's just a dick in general.

They rent the basement space, the living room is YOUR space. He has no business taking up your space, and then complaining when you use it as well.", "NTA. This guy is overstepping boundaries. They rent the downstairs. If he wants to play a game or use your TV, he can at least ask. And to give you crap over breastfeeding? He has to go!\n\nAlso, if he has a back injury, he should either get on disability or find a job that doesn't hurt his back.", "NTA. This is no different than if they lived next door and he came over and deposited himself in your space every day. AND you're a new mom (congrats!), so if he ain't helping out he needs to get out.\n\nAn extention cable costs $5. If the bed hurts his back then he can sit on the floor or buy a chair.", "NTA. The rent the basement not the living room. Stop allowing them to eat with you", "NTA. You are doing them a favor by letting them stay, are recovering from having a baby, and deserve to be comfortable in your own home. BIL is a misogynistic AH. Tell SIL to find a new place to live ASAP.", "NTA \n\nYour house, your rules. They rent the basement so he has no business taking over your living room. \n\nGive them an end date, say 3-6 months from now. They're taking advantage of you and your plate is full. \n\nSpeaking of plates, tell him that food isn't allowed in your living room, that all meals must be eaten in the kitchen. That's the rule in my house. No crumbs or spills on my couch or floors! He sounds like he won't clean it up and you'd have to do it.", "NTA. They don't rent your whole house. They are paying for the basement, and that's the space they have. End of story.", "It's time to tell SIL that they need to find alternate living arrangements\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nyou should have  serious conversation with your SIL, I understand why she would not want him downstairs with her all day while she tries to rest, he sounds like an absolute tosser. But this can' t go on and cause you distress in your own home with a newborn especially.", "NTA you have the right to your own house.\n\nThat said, you should start working on getting them out; that does *not* sound like it's getting better any time soon.", "NTA. He's not renting your living room, he's renting your basement. It's your house and your child. He can either keep his ass downstairs or shut his mouth.", "So you should let him be an asshole to you, in your own home, because he's too useless to buy an extension cord?\n\nThis guy gives useless a bad name.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You've tried to help them and he's been taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA. If they don't have a TV downstairs, they can save money and buy one. You've been gracious enough to allow him to use the living room and he has the audacity to criticize what you do in the space he doesn't pay for and has no right to.\n\nI would say sit the SIL and her husband down and have a talk about how the renting situation will work. They have full access to the basement since they pay for it. They can have access to the rest of the house, but keep in mind that, out of the basement, they are a GUEST and they are expected to act like one. They don't get to act like they own the space when they are outside of the basement. They don't get to complain about what the owners are doing outside of the basement.\n\nFeel bad for the SIL since the guy sounds like a complete jerk and this essentially punishes her at the same time. This whole \"old fashioned mindset that woman do housework thing\" also sounds like BS because that means he should be the one working and providing for him and his wife. Unfortunately not much you can do about that because she chose him and chose to live with this.", "NTA.\n\nIf it's causing issues for your SIL because he's just a dick, it sounds to me like those *should* be her issues and not anyone else's.  I mean, it's not right for her to make it anyone else's issue.", "Nta\n\nYou had more patience than I would have shown.  Stand firm. Praise hubby for having your back, tho he should be the one to set boundaries with HIS sister.", "NTA\n\nThey rent the basement and have no rights to the rest of the house. He shouldn't even be using that room much less complaining about anything that happens in there. Be very careful about this situation because this guy sounds like a lifer - if he's got cheap rent and somebody cooking him food he isn't paying for then I can't see him making any moves to leave your house any time soon.", "Well, it's your house, so your rules and they're paying rent to stay in the basement, so NTA. What stands out for me, though, is that your BIL has been crossing a boundary by using the living room to his heart's content, and he's also been insulting/saying inappropriate thing's to you, yet you've never called him on his s**t. Why? Why wait and wait, letting it all build up until you go to an extreme place and forbid him to be in the LR?\n\nMoving forward, I encourage you to say something when BIL does/says something out of bounds: \"Dude! What you just said? It's inappropriate, so knock it off.\" \n\nMaybe a little too direct? \ud83d\ude00\n\nAlso, you may have talked to them about this already, but do they have a plan to move out anytime in the near future? If not, I think that needs to happen. Your BIL needs to spend time finding work instead of playing games so they can save up and exit your basement.", "You're doing the least sexual thing ever, in your own damn home. Nursing a newborn isn't something that should be a dirt, shameful secret. I think it might be time for them to move on if he doesn't want to \"see that shit\". NTA", "NTA. Your living room isn\u2019t part of his lease and he didn\u2019t pay to use your tv. \n\nAn extension cord should solve his problems of reaching the laptop.", "NTA. Stop feeding them though.", "NTA,  I'd forbid him from coming upstairs at all. He can stay down there and rot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
