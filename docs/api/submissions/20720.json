You don't need someone that toxic long term in your home, especially around your child.  And males in a home not a blood relative is a danger for your child as she gets older.  Especially ones who don't respect women's boundaries. \n\nIf he can play video games for hours, then he can be working online or answering phones & such for airlines, Amazon and such.   There are lots of jobs a person can do online from home.", "NTA\n\nThey get what they paid for. If they have a problem with that, they can go live somewhere else. \u201cHard times\u201d seems more like he doesn\u2019t want to work. Maybe he should try getting a job instead of playing games all day so the times aren\u2019t so hard and they can have a bigger living space.", "NTA. Sounds like it\u2019s time for your entitled freeloading misogynists BIL to move out. He was over stayed his welcome and is making the first weeks of having your child be awful. Time for him to move out.", "NTA and neither is it your job to fix your SIL's problem. I'd give them a couple of months to get out.  SIL would be welcome to stay but he's got to go.", "NTA. I'm sure he'd be welcome to share the upstairs if he could keep a civil tongue in his head, but he can't do that, so he doesn't deserve the privilege of relaxing in the sitting area where proper folks live. \n\nYour kid eating doesn't have anything to do with his redneck ass. He can keep his yap shut or be somewhere he doesn't have to see it.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for breastfeeding your baby in your own living room. You even cover yourself to be more appropriate, so you\u2019ve taken the steps for his comfort. If he\u2019s too immature to understand that and he\u2019s making you uncomfortable in your own home then he should be restricted to his own space (the basement)", "Both of you are doormats", "NTA\n\nIf he was truly a 50s style man his wife would not be the one working, he would. He would have a job and she would be a stay at home wife. \n\nHe wants all the benefits/sexism of acting like he's in the 50s but he doesn't want any of the responsibilities/values of the 50s. A 50s era's man would not be content to have his wife be his financial support while he does nothing. \n\nA 50s era's man would not be content to be using his wife's money to rent out the basement of his in-laws home while he does nothing to find him and his wife a place of their own. A 50s era's man would not be content to blatantly and repeatedly disrespect and dishonor his hosts. His 50s pride would not stand for any of that. \n\nThe 50s had lots of issues and problematic values. but they also had a rulebook, a sort of code of societal conduct, to match those values. He's not a 50s style southern boy, he's nothing but a poser who liked the sexism of the 50s as far as it would benefit him but not farther", "NTA. He's made himself unwelcome.  You could be nice and pick up an extension cord for the plug.  My dollar store and Walmart sells them under $2 usually.", "Funny how he makes his wife do everything in the house because he\u2019s \u2018old fashioned\u2019 but at the same time he isn\u2019t the man supporting the family at work while his wife remains home.", "But what\u2019s the point of showing him any respect if he has none for OP, his own wife, or any other woman? I get it in general, but he is a backwards hillbilly who should be shamed for his inexcusable behavior", "So, he thinks Crows Feet is a disease of the feet? I haven't found anything more stupid in a long time. He really is a moron. Can you lock them out of your house? I would stop with the meals as well. He's fine living off you and the wife and doesn't plan to do anything else. Maybe if he was bored in his basement all day without a TV, he'll get a job just to have something to do. They're so broke they can't afford a TV but he can play games on yours all day. NTA. You didn't rent to roommates. They have their space and need to stay there especially since the baby came along. You don't need the stress of a couch potato rooting himself to her living room all day.", "Nor did they say they were oppressed.", "Maybe he lives for the ballet?", "crows love corn chips"]}
