For the past two weeks, one of his coworkers has asked him to also cover their Saturday night shift. In exchange, he would have this upcoming weekend off entirely. Due to this, my husband asks if I wanted to go to a church conference that weekend or if I wanted him to take us on a trip but the destination would be a surprise. I chose surprise trip because the times that we have gone to the church conferences, it is not that enjoyable and its usually like 6-8 hour event. Weekends are also really the only time we get to spend time together because through the week he works 12hr shifts and by the time he's gets home Mon-Thur, it's already 9:30pm. I wait for him to get home so we can eat dinner together and by 11p, I'm usually falling asleep. \n\nSo for like the past week or so, I had been trying to guess and every time, he hypes it up and tells me that he's not telling me. Today, I was talking to his grandma and she was telling me that she had somethings that she wanted to send over to Maryland to her daughter. She started saying how she was gonna to ship it using UPS but she was really grateful that my Husband said that he would be able to pick it up and get it there for her by next week (I had not mentioned anything to his grandma about a trip or anything) . Right when she said that, I already knew where we were going.\n\n I called my husband and I was like soo we are going to Maryland. He tried to play it off but eventually just said yeah, we are. I just said oh okay. Then he was like Wow, I guess you're disappointed and I said I wasn't and that it was okay. Then he goes on to say how this weekend is his aunt's birthday and we are gonna go to help her celebrate. \n\nHe then brought up how about a month ago when we were looking for a place to go we had said that we should visit his aunt and her family but at the time we ended up going to Florida. We talked some more, and eventually I did admit that I was disappointed because I felt that this wasn't a trip for us. It was more to see his aunt and say happy birthday in person. Especially since more than likely, we will stay at her house and be with them the entire weekend. I don't have any any problem going to visit them or spend time with her and her family. I just think it shouldn't have been something he didn't try to pass off as a surprise for me/us. I had the impression it was gonna be for us to spend time together which we will I guess but it gonna be more like spending family time together. After I communicated this, he started to sound down and then we ended the call.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being excited about this for the sheer fact that he made it seem like something for us as a couple but it doesn't really feel that way?", "created_utc": 1684777168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oxka6/aita_for_being_disappointed_in_the_surprise/", "score": 567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would spend the weekend home alone having good wine and re-evaluating my relationship.", "He might as well have given her a bowling ball with his name on it.", "I'm glad you said this because I was like, \"wait, those options sound way better!\"", "NTA, this sounds cheap as ass, in more ways than one.", "Man, your husband sounds boring asf. Church conference? Aunts birthday in Maryland?? That's how he spends his free time??? Tf, I can't even judge this as it's not even something that should be here, have fun in Maryland\ud83d\ude02", "Some people don't even want to be surprised with their own family", "I make excellent oatmeal (the things you can add into it! The options are both delicious and endless!) but you can do the painting.", "Ugh, and Maryland?!? I live in that hellhole. Why would anyone think that's a great little vacation?", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think he is either.  He sounds absolutely clueless and rather boring (probably a really nice guy though) but doesn\u2019t sound like he was trying to trick you or hide it from you.  He said it would be a surprise, but did he ever indicate it would be a romantic getaway or just the 2 of you?  ( Offering church conference as one option indicates to me that he never even thought about a romantic getaway, or alone time at all).  He, likely, genuinely thought you would be happy with the trip.  I think you both need to learn to communicate better.  Knowing what you know about him, you should have probably just given him a few options of what you consider a nice surprise, and not left it to his lack of imagination.", "NTA for him going to visit his aunt as a surprise. But don\u2019t diss MD, it\u2019s the best state! Depending on where you are going there is a ton to do and see", "NAH - Maryland can be a nice place to visit, maybe you can do some things alone together, local sight seeing, etc, instead of spending the whole time with his family? I feel like that would be a nice balance. I understand your disappointment but I also don't think he did anything wrong.", "NTA. If that\u2019s the trip I would decline. Sit Mr. Excitement down and explain clearly how awful this is. If he persists, find something entertaining to do for yourself and let him go alone, with the clear notification that you choose the next trip. Long, tedious church crap as vacation, I can\u2019t even.", "NTA. But I am too much the agnostic and family avoidant (toxicity beyond belief) to give you the reasons other than he doesn't seem to be too \"romantically\" interested in you as a person?\n\nHave you **EVER** taken a romantic getaway? That **didn't** include family or church? Both items, in my view, are \"anti-romance.\" \n\nIs this the kind of marriage you had in mind? Expected? Enjoy? Wish to remain in? \n\nYou might want to hang back and spend some time alone with yourself and enjoy some pampering or relaxation and get your feelings in order.\n\nLet me tell you, there are alot of marriages that are downright sexy, exciting and fulfilling. Having a romantic marriage is pretty much the antithesis to church and elder relatives. JMHO.\n\nGood luck.", "I had told my ex husband that I wanted a juicer for Mother\u2019s Day. I worked in the morning and came home to find a pineapple on the kitchen bench. Super excited I thought I also had the juicer to go with it. Nope. Just a pineapple \ud83c\udf4d \n\nOP you are NTA that\u2019s a shitty surprise", "0.o", "Me. I\u2019m some people. I\u2019ve made a rule that my parents have to give me three days notice to visit me. They don\u2019t like that and I don\u2019t care.", "And make sure you take your time finding those gifts.\n\n It's not a real birthday outing if you just go and buy everything straight away. You have to take it slow and window shop in every store first, then go get lunch at your favourite place while you decide which presents you want to buy for yourself (let's face it ALL OF THEM) and then you go back and buy them.", "I like that. How far away do your parents live?", "Hey, painting is fun in groups. My neighbour gave her kids water-based paint and told them to paint the interior wall of the garage white (it was bright yellow). They were 5 brothers, the two eldest held the youngest star fished on the wall (off the ground) while the middle two painted him. By the time they were done there was a perfect yellow silhouette on the wall and all 5 were covered in paint standing in the middle of another neighbours front yard (where we had been standing watching the shenanigans) getting hosed off before their mother deemed them clean enough to walk through the house to have a proper shower.\n\nOP, NTA and maybe explain to him (if you havent already) what a surprise vacation looks like to you so he knows in the future so that he can't make the same mistake again and honestly I would have been pissed if I had not been told until we pulled up at aunts place so atleast not you know in advance and can plan accordingly (I don't think family would have appreciated the wardrobe I would have packed if I was expecting a couples weekend).", "Depens on the relatives and the location.", "In the winter they are a three hour flight but in the summer, a three hour drive. And because they are who they are I had to reiterate that I meant 3 business days/72 hours. Not telling me Wednesday night that they will be here Saturday morning.", "I have undermedicated ADHD, I make no promises as to what state you'll get your room back in if you let me paint it. (Okay okay, it would be perfectly painted but I would be CRANKY.) I can see the appeal but my brain just doesn't work that way. Though I WOULD willingly be the starfish in your example, I admit."]}
