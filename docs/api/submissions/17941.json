For the past two weeks, one of his coworkers has asked him to also cover their Saturday night shift. In exchange, he would have this upcoming weekend off entirely. Due to this, my husband asks if I wanted to go to a church conference that weekend or if I wanted him to take us on a trip but the destination would be a surprise. I chose surprise trip because the times that we have gone to the church conferences, it is not that enjoyable and its usually like 6-8 hour event. Weekends are also really the only time we get to spend time together because through the week he works 12hr shifts and by the time he's gets home Mon-Thur, it's already 9:30pm. I wait for him to get home so we can eat dinner together and by 11p, I'm usually falling asleep. \n\nSo for like the past week or so, I had been trying to guess and every time, he hypes it up and tells me that he's not telling me. Today, I was talking to his grandma and she was telling me that she had somethings that she wanted to send over to Maryland to her daughter. She started saying how she was gonna to ship it using UPS but she was really grateful that my Husband said that he would be able to pick it up and get it there for her by next week (I had not mentioned anything to his grandma about a trip or anything) . Right when she said that, I already knew where we were going.\n\n I called my husband and I was like soo we are going to Maryland. He tried to play it off but eventually just said yeah, we are. I just said oh okay. Then he was like Wow, I guess you're disappointed and I said I wasn't and that it was okay. Then he goes on to say how this weekend is his aunt's birthday and we are gonna go to help her celebrate. \n\nHe then brought up how about a month ago when we were looking for a place to go we had said that we should visit his aunt and her family but at the time we ended up going to Florida. We talked some more, and eventually I did admit that I was disappointed because I felt that this wasn't a trip for us. It was more to see his aunt and say happy birthday in person. Especially since more than likely, we will stay at her house and be with them the entire weekend. I don't have any any problem going to visit them or spend time with her and her family. I just think it shouldn't have been something he didn't try to pass off as a surprise for me/us. I had the impression it was gonna be for us to spend time together which we will I guess but it gonna be more like spending family time together. After I communicated this, he started to sound down and then we ended the call.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being excited about this for the sheer fact that he made it seem like something for us as a couple but it doesn't really feel that way?", "created_utc": 1684777168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oxka6/aita_for_being_disappointed_in_the_surprise/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd like to go to see her.\n\nNot \"surprise\" you with a trip to visit his family. That's not a good surprise. That's a family obligation.\n\nIt might be something he'd like to be surprised with. Which is good to know. But that doesn't mean it's something he should surprise you with.", "NTA. Maybe you should bring it up again with him and just explain why you are/were disappointed.

Hubby missed the opportunity.", "NTA your husband hyped up this destination. He told you it was a surprise and so of course you'd think/hope that he wanted to spend quality time with you. Instead he's arranged for you all to spend quality time with his aunt. No reason for him to make that a surprise and I'd be disappointed too after waiting up till 11 pm to see him regularly and then get a trip to his aunt's house instead of a romantic weekend.  There was literally no reason for him to keep this a surprise unless he wanted to see you disappointed, which I assume he didn't .", "I would stay home an let him go by himself", "NTA He missed a perfect opportunity to get laid.

He needs to get a clue lol.", "NTA but I also think you can tell him that next time he plans a surprise getaway he owes you a proper romantic get away. Set that expectation now.", "Nta\n\nThe problem with planning surprises is that you need to be prepared for the surprisee not liking it as much as you hoped. And going with him to hang out with *his* family and attend a party for *his* *aunt* is supposed to be a surprise for you *how*?", "NTA\n\nYour husband manipulated you\n\nPlain and simple", "Yeah, NTA\n\nIt was a surprise trip. This and the hyping it up definitely made it sound like a couples trip where it would be just you two having fun somewhere and bonding, not spending time with family. I'd be very hurt as well. It sounds like he is either extremely clueless and really thought this would somehow be a great surprise or he is playing dumb and knew you wouldn't actually be happy so that's why he made it a \"surpise\".", "NTA.  Your husband is an AH in this case since his usage of  \"surprise\"  is not generally what it means.  You are correct thinking it is a special time for just you two.  While, I enjoy my relatives, I don't consider it a surprise to go stay with them when used in the same context  your husband used. Your husband has now tainted the next surprise he tries to pull since you will now be thinking of this attempt.  He shot himself in his foot in this manner but hopefully will come around to your point in this instance.", "NTA he hyped it up to be a romantic/intimate getaway.

But he played it off as a fun surprise to be excited for. This is not that.", "NTA your husband was a bit of an AH for hyping the weekend trip as a \"couple getaway\" when it was something he was doing for himself.  You are disappointed because of HIS actions and he needs to own that.  What would he have done if you selected the church trip?", "NTA\n\nThere is a WORLD of difference between a romantic weekend getaway and thee weekend spent in your aunt's house with lots of family. These are two different types of trips. \n\nAnd he was willing to kill two birds with one stone and didn't care the romantic weekend turned into a weekend at Bernadette's. He sacrificed your trip (disappointing you) to make his grandma and aunt happy. I bet it's not the first time he's sidelined your wants and needs for his family's and I bet he chalks it up to family being there for family and never is there for HIS immediate family, namely... you.", "NTA. For you it went from a lovely couples trip to a family visit. I\u2019d be disappointed too.", "My husband once hyped up a present so much that I was so excited that it was gonna be a dog. It wasn\u2019t lol. I get the disappointment and Nta", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d be upset", "NTA. He played it off like it was a big surprise destination but then knowing you were going somewhere to visit another family member would be a huge letdown for me espresso if I was led to believe it was a trip just for the 2 of us", "NTA. That sounds like a chore, not a couples weekend.", "A trip for 2 vs a family trip. Theres a whole set of wardrobe i would not pack for one. But would the other. I think its ok to be disappointed. Just tell him family vacations are a discussion. The 2 of you can be surprise destinations. NAH. Yet.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, I can see how the preceding convo about the upcoming birthday might have dovetailed into a fun trip away for you two in your hubby's mind. I might have made the same assumption, tbh. \n\nWhat I would have also done is have a surprise stop along the way for something you might like or stay in a swanky hotel if that's your thing.  Something in addition to the bday festivities. \n\nI have found that while my hubby is awesome at many things, sometimes he just misses what I want. When that happens I make sure I show appreciation for the thoughtfulness and what, in his mind, was a great gift or surprise.  A bit later I'll then add \"could I add a stop or pick the place on our trip\" or some such.  Then I find the romantic spot, etc. \n\nThat way I don't \"ruin the trip\" by overlooking what he tried (but failed) to do and we still get to have fun with my added surprise... That is our own compromise, of course. But I mention it in case it might be helpful to you, OP.", "Can you break into paragraphs?  It's hard to read a wall of text, especially on a phone.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think he meant it to be an AH move; however, I can see why you\u2019re disappointed. Can you talk to him about it? Tell him how you feel, and then let him know you expect a REAL trip just the two of you, and this time you pick.", "YTA  Ya'll don't communicate very well.  Like how how could you have a discussion about the trip and not know if you are staying with the aunt?  Sounds like that would make a big difference to you since you mentioned it.  \n\nYou just went to Florida a month ago and now you're upset this current trip isn't more you centered.  \n\nSo know that you know, would you rather have gone to the church conference?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I broke in up into paragraphs. I hope that helps!", "I definitely will talk to him! When I called him and this situation happened, he was at work so we couldn't talk for very long. I would like for us to plan something else for the future.", "He was at work when I called him and I just called him to ask if that's where we were going. We didn't have a long drawn out conversation about where we are sleeping or every single logistic because he was working. That's just an assumption I made based on where we are going. Also I'm disappointed because it was hyped up to be a surprise for me/us as a couple (I don't know how you missed that part when it was the whole point of the post???). It's about the principal of making it seem like it's one thing when it's really another. \n\nNow that I know, I still would not choose the church conference BUT again there's no need to make it seem like it's a surprise for me/us when it's really for us to go see his aunt for her birthday.

Clearly this wasn\u2019t a trip for OP from the start. He should have been straight forward about what the trip was. This wasn\u2019t secret worthy. Making it a secret and continuing to make it a secret after repeat questioning *is* hyping it up. And it\u2019s also pretty crummy of him considering he\u2019s been working Saturday nights to get it, and they\u2019ve missed out on time together. \n\nI\u2019d definitely have a sit down with him and explain how you feel about this. It\u2019s fair to be disappointed, and it\u2019s also fair that he needs to carve out some time for the two of you to spend some quality time together. It doesn\u2019t need to be a trip, but a special date night or something you can do together is deserved.", "Exactly!", "..on which you buy items only for yourself.", "Honestly.

You seem to assumed that, which is entirely your problem.  You've given no examples of his hype to judge by.  All we know is he said \"surprise destination\" which he came through on since you were surprised.  \n\nThe MD trip rates higher than the church trip by your standards.  That should be good enough.", "OP said they went to Florida together last month.", "For sure. Visits with relatives are obligations not a vacation or a surprise.", "Generally when a person tells their partner that they're going to surprise them with something, that means it is a positive thing that their partner will be excited about.
