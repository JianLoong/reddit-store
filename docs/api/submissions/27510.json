We think the vegetarian should eat before or after and just sit for an hour enjoying the families companies if there isn\u2019t something on the menu they want. We do not think 12 people should change their plans to caterer to one person (we do not know if it\u2019s vegetarian by choice or for a health reason). My wife thinks we should pick a restaurant with more vegetarian options. \n\nAre we the asshole for not wanting to change?\n\nAdditional information - when I mention above that there is nothing she can eat, that wasn\u2019t accurate, but her words.  Are are salads that by default come with meat, but you can request not to include.  She said she didn\u2019t want to do that.\n\nAlso, uncovered the vegetarianism is not for ethical reasons.

Why don't you want to change venue?", "NTA\n\n>We do not think that 12 people should change their plans to caterer to one person\n\nGiven that there actually are options (salad) for her to eat, I fully agree.\n\nI am saying this as a celiac, sometimes you have to suck it up and eat the lettuce salad", "I\u2019m trying to understand why dietary requirements were not considered before a restaurant was decided on. \n\nThe bit where I think you are being an AH is that you think your company is worth so much that someone should happily just sit and watch you eat, when presumably, unless you all talk with your mouth full, not a lot of interacting will be happening. Given the attitude that projects, she probably isn\u2019t expecting to enjoy your company. \n\nIt\u2019s really not difficult to find somewhere with options, this almost feels deliberate. \n\nAnd if you just remove the meat from a salad, without a substitute, there\u2019s no protein, which won\u2019t be filling or satisfying.", "I don't think you're an AH, but your not kind either.  As a vegetarian I never tell people were to eat.  I can always find something to eat.  The only request (not demand) I may  make is not eat at a seafood place because I can't take the smell.  But if the majority wants to go to one. I suck it up and go.  By the same token if I am with a carnivore, I would never pick a vegetarian restaurant.  I would want the people I am with to be comfortable even if it puts me out a little.  Kindness is never wrong.", "NTA- She's on a diet. There are salads. You can't carpet the world because 1 person refuses to wear shoes. Don't change your plans.", "I\u2019ve been a vegetarian for 15+ years and usually I\u2019m fine picking just a side or asking for a modification to a dish with meat in it, but some places (particularly in the American South) make that pretty difficult. Once in Texas I had a salad that was literally just lettuce and cheese without the chicken. That was the best option. Although I do agree that as a vegetarian we should be able to find something that will work for us, some places honestly make that difficult. I can guess them being GF adds to that. \n\nIf you don\u2019t care if they are able to be included, why bother inviting them. YTA. The world doesn\u2019t need to revolve around them but how hard is it to choose a restaurant that could give them at least a couple decent options?", "INFO: is the gluten-free thing by choice or due to health concerns? That may make it far more difficult for her. I find the gluten-free thing is more annoying than vegetarian", "INFO: Does the restaurant have any salads? And vegetables? Any soups? Or is it the Pork'n'Steak house?", "I love this,, \n\n\"We think the vegetarian should eat before or after and just sit for an hour enjoying the families companies if there isn\u2019t something on the menu they want.\" It says everything about you and your wife.", "Yes & no. I find it really hard to believe this place doesn\u2019t have a salad unless its a sushi place or something. But at the same time it\u2019s really not hard to just pick another restaurant. Sounds like you both are being difficult.", "Meh, You're kind of the asshole, but I won't go full YTA.\n\nAs a Celiac who also doesn't eat meat, I would definitely appreciate someone choosing a place that could accommodate my needs (more the Celiac than the vegetarian, as veg is easier to accommodate), but personally, I will always take the reins and choose the spot, make the reservation and essentially take the initiative to take care of myself.\n\nJust some food for thought - while there may be something she *can* eat on the menu (yup, salad, always salad), being able to (maybe) be able to safely eat at a restaurant always being a salad really sucks.\n\nLastly, while I choose not to eat meat for ethical reasons, just because her reasons are different, it's irrelevant. It's still her choice, and you need to respect it.\n\nETA: Who are you referring to when you say \"we\"? Because from what you said, your wife doesn't agree with you, yet you keep saying \"we\". Don't lump her into your narrow-minded decision. \n\nAlso - how would you feel if someone told you to eat before going to a restaurant because a place has been chosen that can care for your needs? \n\nLike shit? As you should. But I don't think you'll ever see it that way, sadly.", "I have Questions!\n\nIs anyone of the other 11 people complaining about going somewhere else?\n\nIs there other restaurants in the area that are just as good for similar prices?", "YTA. This is a really inconsiderate thing to do to a family member. I\u2019m a vegetarian with a few food allergies. It feels so crappy to have to get the side salad with no dressing while everyone else gets to enjoy a nice, complete meal. And you have to watch everyone else eat, adding insult to injury. How hard would it be to pick a restaurant where everyone can eat?", "Since you all sound like AHs, whoever she is , she should skip out on the meal completely, because who can enjoy the company of people who don\u2019t give a shit about her? Especially because it sounds like the point of this meal was the restaurant, so putting the spin on it that it is mainly as \u201cfamily time\u201d is disingenuous.  \n\nAnd a lot of my judgment has not to do with whether adjustments can be made for her at that restaurant.  It has to do with how you talk about the issue. And the fact that you expect her to literally put up and shut up, and happily watch everybody else eat.", "YTA. this person should eat before hand and enjoy watching everyone else feasting?\n\nWhy don't you all just eat before and enjoy each other at a park setting? \n\nOn one hand, you are implying the eating isn't that important, and on the other that it is so important you can't even both to change the venue with days of advance notice.", "YTA. So what if it\u2019s just one person? That is an entire human being who will have to sit and watch the rest of you eat a nice restaurant meal together. Yes, she\u2019d still get the companionship of being around you, but a big part of having a meal together is *having a meal together*. I don\u2019t understand why the rest of you would choose to leave her out when you could take fifteen minutes out of your life to find a different restaurant.", "YTA, she\u2019s just asking for a restaurant with an option she can eat at. My child is gluten free and I couldn\u2019t imagine expecting her to sit and watch everyone else eat when we easily could to to another restaurant.", "YTA\n\nExpecting someone to sit and watch everyone else eat is downright ridiculous.", "I'm on the fence here. It seems reasonable that if you meet up to pick a place where everybody can eat, but in large groups you really should follow what the group wants. If you meet up often enough, it would be nice to let her pick the restaurant every once in a while. I'm gonna say NTA.\n\nRegarding her reason is for weight loss though, I think she's going about this a silly way.\n\nRestaurants aren't exactly the best for dieting. Fat is flavor, and flavor is what sells. A lot of vegan places have such delicious tasting food because it's drenched in that flavorful fat. I love a delicious vegan meal, but expecting a meal at a vegan restaurant to be healthier than a salad at any other restaurant is a good way to gain weight -- if you think you're eating better when you're not, you're not going to pay as much attention to what's going into your body. \n\nEven if she just has a side or an appetizer while everybody else is eating, she can still enjoy some food and the company without sitting on the sidelines pouting. She could eat a full homemade meal before and after, then use this meal as a snack, spaced out ofc and it would probably be way healthier than a meal at different place that the rest of the group doesn't really want. \n\nBeing that we don't know what she actually wants, it's hard to say whether it would actually be healthier or not, but it's a pretty good guess that it whatever she has would be equally or less healthy than a salad.", "INFO: does the restaurant have gluten free options?\n\nA lot of sauces are usually not gluten free in my experience - in the event she was considering eating meat here the once.", "YTA. Don't invite someone to eat where they can't eat anything.", "YTA.. simply because every single sentence you wrote makes clear that you are an unbearable person. Also what dusty place even serves all their salads with default meat in 2023? Sounds disgusting.", "YTA. And a big one.\n\nOne: why don't YOU eat before the meeting and enjoy the company while she eats?\nTwo: what do they sell at that restaurant that you are refusing to go somewhere else?\nThree: if she's vegetarian because she wants to lose weight, you should support her and go somewhere she can enjoy a decent meal without breaking her diet. One of the most difficult parts of trying to lose weight is your family and friends not supporting you and preparing food (or going somewhere) you can't eat (or they eating something you can't in front of you), and where the only option available you'll find is a crappy plate full with lettuce and some tomato and onion.", "YTA Why wouldn't you want everyone to feel included and welcome?", "YTA. It would be one thing if there was even one thing on the menu this person could eat. \n\nI suggest that you contact the restaurant and see if they can do anything. My team wanted to go to a steakhouse and I was vegetarian at the time. They very graciously made me a nice plate of veggies. Normally I would say it\u2019s up to your friend to call them, but you\u2019ve been an AH and need a redemption arc.", "Just let the restaurant know or ask them for a vegetarian option.\n\nUsually they find a way.", "YTA for sure. \n\nI think it would be thoughtful to include the friend. Salad alone is not a complete meal. Y'all can eat anywhere. They have limited options. I couldn't enjoy my meal knowing someone gets nothing when a simple change of plans would allow everyone to have a meal. \n\n*However* I am vegan and am aware its a difficult diet to accommodate. I either plan ahead (check menus or nearby restaurants), eat ahead, or don't attend the meal if there isn't anything for me. I don't expect anyone to change plans to cater to my ethical choices (but literally all of my friends are thoughtful enough to consider my veganism and soy allergy when it comes to choosing a place to eat, so I don't often have this issue anymore). \n\nI do get upset when I am promised a vegan option for an volunteer event, a friend's dinner party, or wedding and the option isn't actually vegan or it is just a few chopped vegetables. The reason this is upsetting is that- in those instances- I was mislead and didn't prepare a meal for myself as I thought I'd have one. I end up hungry watching others eat.", "The group that decided were not aware the person was vegetarian.\n\nAlso worth noting the people from out of town specifically wanted to eat here.", "NTA, but I think everyone in this situation could have handled things better. I've been vegetarian for 24 years and if I was invited out to a place with no options for me to eat, I wouldn't go. Sorry, not sorry. I'd enjoy lunch on my own and meet up with people later.  If it was a big deal to see the people involved, I'd order the salad and no meat.  But also, if you know someone in your party has food sensitivities, it is a kind and welcoming gesture to choose a restaurant with options everyone can enjoy. \n\nAs a dietitian I can't help but wonder, gluten free? that doesn't help with weight loss. But whatever. to each his own.", "YTA and none of your comments have made you any less of an asshole.", "YTA. If you were the one person that had a diet restriction (by choice or by need) you\u2019d want the large family to find an alternate restaurant. Is it really that difficult?", "YTA. You seriously want her to eat beforehand and just watch you all eat? That's ridiculous and entitled of you to expect that of her. There isn't anything for her to eat, including the salad that comes with meat. Asking her to \"just remove the meat\" is kinda disrespectful.  Why invite her at all if she can't eat anything there?", "NTA-It seems like from your addition that this person is only doing it for dietary weight loss purposes.   12-1 majority rules.", "NTA. Majority rules.  There may not be a lot of choices for her but I\u2019m positive there are vegetarian options.  Heck a vegetarian can eat at McDonalds.", "So your position is \"Oh it's cool she can just eat a pile of lettuce while the rest of us enjoy a proper meal, or fuck it she can just get Taco Bell before or after!\"\n\nYes, that is true, and I'm sure she does it often when she must. But that's a really shitty fucking thing to do to a friend/family member when you're supposed to all be getting together and enjoying each other's company.\n\nSounds like there are plenty of other places you can go where EVERYONE can get something they can enjoy.\n\nMajor YTA. I'm no vegetarian but if I were her I'd tell you to go fuck yourselves.", "YTA\n\nThere is no shortage of restaurants that offer vegetarian options in addition to meat.  Why choose to exclude one person when it's easy to include everyone?\n\nTheir reason for being vegetarian is irrelevant.", "A lot of my extended family are vegan or vegetarian. Do you know what I do? Let them pick the restaurant.", "The vegetarian can call ahead and arrange something with the restaurant easily enough.

YTA", "YTA it's definitely asshole behavior to go to a restaurant with family when one of the family members can't eat the food there. It's really not a big deal anyways. Just choose a different restaurant. You live there, you can go to the original restaurant whenever you want.", "There's no salad?", "NTA. After reading edits and comments, this person sounds like she\u2019s being super difficult just to be difficult. This is all because she went on a diet to lose weight.

You\u2019re telling that family member that she\u2019s not really part of the family if you can\u2019t be bothered to coordinate plans that accommodate her. If she insisted that you all eat at a vegetarian restaurant, then she\u2019d be the asshole, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. You could find a place that works for everyone.

I have a good friend who is vegetarian and she is great at it.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nShe can call the restaurant!\n\nAs someone who is gluten free, dairy free and wine has to be preservative free. I have called many a restaurant in my life.  \n\nHave even bought my own wine to a restaurant when it wasn\u2019t a BYO place. \n\nRestaurants are usually really good. \n\nI\u2019m also not coeliac so I explain I get sick from gluten but cross continuation is not dramatic. \n\nI\u2019ve yet to come across a restaurant that can\u2019t accommodate me when I\u2019ve rang ahead.", "YTA most people wouldn't find it a problem to change a restaurant to something that has at least one vegetarian option. As a vegetarian I wouldn't want to eat in a place that has no meat free meals either, I'd be worried that even with my request they wouldn't prepare  my meal without meat but rather remove meat from something premade and that is not the same.

It\u2019s ridiculous to ask her to sit there and eat nothing bc yam are too selfish to care if there is something there for everyone. It\u2019s not like she shot down a bunch of restaurants. She said there isn\u2019t anything there she can eat. And I don\u2019t care if her dietary needs are ethical, allergic, or health based.

The one person in the party can eat, she is just choosing to be difficult and inflexible.", "Not suggesting that at all.  However, I do feel ethical reasons carry more weight than worrying about a few pounds. For an ethical vegetarian it\u2019s about life and death, in this case it\u2019s about waistline. I can respect both choices, however, I am more willing to bend my perspective for an ethical vegetarian.", "Are you unwilling to see from alternate perspective.  A restaurant that parents want to celebrate their 50th anniversary needs to be changed? \n\nWhat would be the other choice so my parents can enjoy a restaurant they\u2019ve been waiting on?  Not to invite her at all?  No one would want to do that.", "Wanting an actual meal at a restaurant isn't being difficult.   What is being difficult and inflexible is insisting on having your meat meal while someone goes without instead of going where everyone can partake.", "But you\u2019d already made this decision before finding out it was a fitness choice rather than an ethical one\u2026why are you arguing it would have made a difference when if clearly didn\u2019t.\n\nETA it seems this isn\u2019t an AITA question. This is a \u201cdo you want this person at this event\u201d question. If the answer is no, then by all means eat at a place they have specifically said they can\u2019t eat at. Let them know that it\u2019s more important to eat there then it is for them to be there. If yes, then it\u2019s actually not that difficult to find a new place.", "YOU are the one who asked if YTA, not me.  \n\nConsensus is, yes.\n\nExpecting a visitor to sit and watch others eat is horribly selfish.  You're an adult - you should get that.  Your wife does!  \n\nI think you should take the advice from the other person who said to call the restaurant to see if there are any vegetarian options or solutions available.  That seems like the best bet.\n\nGood luck."]}
