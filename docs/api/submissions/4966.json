Fake names used. \n\nTw: talk of OD\n\nSo my (29F) dad, Ryan (63M) had a friend over last year named Alicia (37F). This is how that visit went:\n\nI was on a walk down our road when he drives by with Alicia. They stopped and she said something along the lines of \"I didn't know they had h00kers this far out.\" Literally the first words she said to me. I didn't really respond to her and just got in the truck and thanked dad for the ride back because my foot was hurting (I was recovering from a foot surgery).\n\nMy kids (5m, 6f at this time) were still at school but would be back in a couple hours. So we go back to the house and I go back to work (I WFH in my bedroom) and they start hanging out. No big deal. A while later dad knocks on my door asking if I want an icecream, and I take a Klondike and go back to work. I don't even get through half of my ice-cream when my dad starts knocking hard/urgently on my door. I open it and he says he needs my help. As he steps back I see Alicia passed out on the floor. She had OD'd. I know it was wrong now, but I helped him move her to his bedroom because the kids were due home any minute. \n\nDad is freaking out and I'm telling him to call an ambulance and he's pushing back on that because she has warrants. I said that's a stupid f*ck\u00a1ng reason to let someone die and call for it myself. The ambulance and everyone comes minutes after the bus let's my kids off. They take her to hospital and I kept the kids outside away from all of that mess. \n\nSo I tell him that will NEVER happen around my kids EVER AGAIN. I thought we had an understanding of why that was traumatic and not something I want my kids around.\n\nSo fast forward to last week and he brings Alicia up in conversation again, basically fielding my response. And it was the same. Hell no. Not ever. He says she's clean now and I told him I just don't care. If he wants to be around her, that's his deal, but my kids and I will NEVER be in that situation again. No. Not again. I'm shaking just remembering that day. He says I'm AH for not giving her a second chance and I said he's an AH for wanting to put us through that again. And also the age gap just churns my stomach, sorry but it does. \n\nWell today he lets slip that he's DATING her... or \"dating this 38 yo woman\" rather. I put 2 and 2 together. \n\nThe whole thing makes me feel like I'm crazy. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: \nDad and I live together. While he paid for the house, I used money to do some upgrades and he considers it half mine.\n\nAnd I did not say he couldn't have her over/see her. I said if she comes over, my kids and I will leave for the visit.", "created_utc": 1671299829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zobxbh/aita_for_telling_my_dad_my_kids_and_i_will_never/", "score": 1087, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he hadn't told you, it would be somewhat safe to assume it's for drug use/sales. Then she ODs at your house. \n\nNow, a year later, your father says she's clean. You have no way to verify that. Does she still have outstanding warrants? If so, at some point, she will be found and your children will be treated to another round of drama.

Especially seeing where you said he literally had to move across the country to get clean previously, it seems doubtful that he was just sitting around watching her using while staying clean himself.

You are going to need time and effort from her and your dad to feel able to build trust in either of them.\n\nAnd she probably shouldn\u2019t be meeting the kids yet anyway as they sound like drugs aside they have had some upheaval and you don\u2019t know if they are serious.

You could even offer to pay everyone back once you're back on your feet if that would make you feel better about it. Either way, I hope you're able to move soon!", "Thank you. That means a lot to me. Yes, I will definitely do a sweep before the kids come home if she's been over", "I wish you the best of luck in this situation. Maybe don't count on your dad sharing the house in the future. His suggestion of building an addition is generous but I question his ability to provide a healthy, safe environment for your kids.\n\nHopefully, once you're done school you can get into your own place. Best of luck in the future", "They don't need to know. Children should evolve around an innocent environment. When I say they'll thank you later it's about the fact that when they grow up and see the difference between them and the others, about how they were brought up without having to see a therapist because of a trauma, about how you helped them grow up in a healthy and secure environment. I believe a child that grow up in a loving home can only love in return", "My thoughts too. I know not to move someone like we did now, but I had to get some privacy to intervene and not have my kids see it", "Yeah I'm definitely going to look at some options and see of there's anything else I can do or someone I can move us in with. But I'm just so scared to bring them around other people because of reasons like this", "Please be careful. If your kids are in the home when drugs are being done or when someone ODs, you could be brought up on neglect and potentially lose your children for being in an unsafe environment.", "NTA. I don't know if your Kids are ever home alone just with him. If so: I really wouldn't trust your father to actually *not* bring her around against your clearly stated wish/boundary, without telling you about it/behind your back.

In some comments you mentioned you have friends that might be able to help you out with your living situation....?\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. But so glad you keep firm with your boundary. Also: I am so sorry you went through that situation with her OD'ing. Your father should have never let that happen to you. It is amazing that you safed her life and kept your kids safe (even though it's horrible you were forced to do those things). It is sad that they never even said \"thank you\"... that is just... unbelievable. You did a huge and incredibly difficult thing for her and her not acknowledging that is just really sad (and maybe a sign of some very ...'off' views on her part on *how* extreme of an experience an OD / rescuing someone from it, is... :/ )\n\nI hope you can work out something for yourself and your kids soon. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA\n\nYour dad should be prioritizing the safety of the people who live there, not forcing you out of your home over an addict he's got as a piece.

Even it means expecting him to reimburse you for everything you paid for on the house so you have money to move out somewhere SAFE.", "NTA - But you set yourself up for failure with that housing situation.  Him considering that it's half yours does not make it so.  \n\nTell him that if he really does consider it half your house to buy out your half and you need to move out.  You simply can not subject your kids to his bad judgement and her drug history.", "NTA but is your name on the deed? If it\u2019s not, the house is not yours and I wouldn\u2019t risk homelessness.

Why would OP trust his judgment ever again? NTA", "NTA. Prioritising kids should always be first.", "No you are not", "NTA but you are probably  going to have to find another place to live. Contact an attorney to see if there is any chance in hell of recouping any money you put in the house, Plus make sure you have something in writing about the ownership of the house in case something happens to your dad.  Sit your dad down and explain that having a drug addict in the house could cause you to be investigated by CPS. All it takes is one more incident and your kids talking about it at school.  Tell him you do not want your children seeing and being exposed to drug addiction or risk losing your children.  You can't stop him from dating her. He can date her but she needs to stay elsewhere. Ask him to go to ALANON meetings. He cannot enable her drug addiction because next time she might die.", "yta due to the fact you live together and technically he is the owner of the house. you cannot prohibit a grown adult from having guests over THEIR house despite how uncomfortable they make you. if you don\u2019t want your kids around her thsts your choice but then YOU need to move to accommodate that wish, it\u2019s not fair you\u2019re putting this in your fad. he\u2019s a grown man and who he dated is his perogative. also the fact you think you also own the house for paying for some upgrades is laughable and something tells me all 3 of you were living there WAY before that.", "Kitchen* but yeah I agree. It's ridiculous and I'm not gonna be a part of it", "Yeah not a fan of hers. And I'm not about to play nice when no apology has been given and no proof of her being sober. He's got choice but to respect it because it'd action I will take if he does X. So he can still choose to do it, and he knows what the outcome will be. And it will lead to him not being around half of his grandchildren. And he knows I don't play that sh!t", "That's exactly what I told him!!! I told him this VERBATIM when it happened and he just didn't care or didn't believe me. And I work as a sub teacher and run a cub scout den. So I CANNOT and WILL NOT be caught up in this bs", "Thank you very much for your kind words. I did what I did to save her because it was the right thing to do. A thank you would be nice and step in the right direction but it's not the reason. I agree that it does speak to the vastly different views we have on the matter. \n\nI am going to field some options and possibly delay my schooling to focus on getting us to a safer place.", "You're very right. It's not, and I don't want to run that risk either. I have family that would take us in if that happened though. I doubt he wants to lose contact with his grandkids though", "Yeah I think it was meant to be a joke that didn't land. As a Marine it didn't even register on my insult meter lol \n\nBut yeah not her biggest fan but I'm glad she's alive", "This. This right here.\n\nHe's the AH for one reason and one only - he let an addict in a home where kids live. If it's hours spent in the house and she OD'd, she took whatever she took (probs heroin) into the house and did it there. He's at fault, 100%, and owes OP all the apology.\n\nNTA - but - consider new housing as this is a sign that your roommate is not trustworthy.", "I mean it's only been one week since she nearly died of an overdose, how much of that week would have been spent in hospital and recovering? That's not a normal week to form a judgement of whether she's clean or not.", "Good for you. If you are going to die in any hill it is this one. It impacts the health and well being of your children as well as your livelihood and ability to support them. Best of luck!

Hopefully there will be more knowledgeable people chiming in with more helpful advice.", "Probably didn't have to say much at all, tbh.

He can marry this lady. Also NTA", "Omg please keep your kids safe. Not all addicts or people in recovery are bad but this particular person almost died in your house in front of your kids from an over dose. That's freaking traumatic as hell for you. You were effected by her actions. \n\nNTA and if you can find a way to get out of there do it because your dad is bring bad drama and bad energies into that house. I mean this was only a year ago, how long has she been sober? Has she even tried to apologize for the trama she caused you? How is she off the drugs because a shitty person is a shitty person sober or not. I mean keep your kids safe and keep them away from her till you can be certain she is safe to be around. Probably should go no contact with dad too because he does not sound remotely healthy either.", "NTA. She ODed in your house while hanging out with your father?

No idea what your father is doing with her-", "NTA\n\nProtect yourself.

That's all good. \n\nHowever if your dad is using again (it's hard to tell if this is true from the post and comments) and he lives in the same house as your kids, you then would be the AH for keeping them under the same roof as him.", "I said all this right after the OD and he didn't care. He believes her when she says she's clean, even without providing proof. So it's his life and he can live it how he wants, and that may mean without us entirely.", "I've not had a good relationship with anyone he or my mom have been with. So idk how it'll play out tbh. But yeah I've got to do more to protect the kids and myself because I don't know how far he's going to fall down this rabbit hole", "I honestly hope she has rhe best life and does recover. But the amount of trauma I sustained from the get go is just not worth it for me. I already have cptsd and that did not help. Honestly going through this again is just terrible for my mental health", "Yeah but maybe it would be better if I just walk away. I really don't wanna fight over a house. It's not worth it to me", "I mean if he makes it more serious then we'll just leave and he can live his best life with her", "We live together so can't go NC just yet. \n\nThere's no proof she's sober, and my dad has said as much. So no, I would very much bet she isn't sober yet. Neither of them have said thank you for saving her. To the opposite really. At most she said she was sorry for the OD, which I said that I'm glad she's still alive but I want nothing further to do with her. \n\nAnd you're right, I don't think she'd be a person I'd want to ve around even without this added mess. \n\nIt was traumatizing. I had to dig into my military training to compartmentalize and take control of the situation. And my dad just does not care that he put me through that.", "She OD'd on xan mixed with fent from what he told me. He wasn't mad she did it, because I'm sure they were doing stuff together and then was only mad they got caught. He saw nothing wrong with it", "It was last year, not recently.

I think the way he has kt set up, he has to have my permission to change anything and I won't give that", "1. I never said he couldn't have her over. I said if he did we would leave because I also agree I can't dictate what he does as a grown adult in his house.\n\n2. HE considers it both of our houses, while I don't really hold that belief.

Looks like they're both addicts, I'm sorry you have to deal with that. But don't think you're safe just because she isn't there. Also, make sure he's not high around the kids, Xanax is a sedative, so it impairs motor controls", "Wouldn't surprise me. It just hurts that I have to start thinking of him in these terms", "Yeah it's good to know that I'm not crazy with my response. That's all I can ask right now until I can move out and make sure everyone is okay. I don't think he will ever see how dangerous this is for me and that hurts", "I didn't take it as insensitive, I'm just kinda... raw about it all. So even the thought of it just isn't appealing to me. \n\nI'm thankful I have had therapy to help cope with my cptsd and any new triggers and issues that pop up. It's hard but worth it. \n\nI do appreciate your insight and kind words though:) thank you", "That's very fair,  even though it's a hard reality check for me to cash.", "This is very true in my experience. You both want the same thing and they have a problem too. I'm 3 years sober. And if I know one thing, it's that if someone's spending time with someone using, they're either using or about to.

You're going to school to get a career and you're working on trying to get your kids out of that situation. You protected them when it mattered most.

Really?\"", "I'm sorry you have to deal with this", "I could cry, that is the nicest thing to say. Thank you from.the bottom of my heart. I am trying so hard and I protect them with everything I have. I know due to my trauma I can default to my survival mode and I don't want to do that, but those tactics got us through worse. \n\nWhen we moved to KY I was with my abusive ex. As soon as I had a job and an apartment (1bdr with a 3 mo old and a toddler. It was... a formative time for all of us) I left my ex and took charge of the kids. I've been doing it on my own ever since.\n\nAnd tbf, my ex has a brother even worse than Alicia and its written into our visitation agreement that he is not allowed around the kids.

This isn't the most ideal situation for children to be in, but you're literally doing everything you can to get them into a better place and that's what matters. You're not excusing your dad and Alicia's actions and you're working hard to change things. That's super important.\n\nI'm also considering going to school for radiology tech so I'm super happy to see you're doing that. That will be really great for you.", "Sadly I think you're right. I think he's falling back on bad habits and I hate that. He's a great guy and has been amazing up until this. He considered it basically a \"oopsie daisy' type of thing. Not the serious event it was. I couldn't sleep for a month afterward thinking someone was going to call CPS on me", "I think so too! I was an RT tech before I moved here, bit it was for metal and welds and such. So it will be fun to learn how to do it to people. I'm honestly excited to see if the teachers will want to xray my surgery joints to get those shots. \n\nAnd you're not, I'm not making excuses for anyone. I know dad hated that I was holding that mirror to his face because he didn't want to face himself. He knows he did wrong and doesn't want to sit with that discomfort.

Where he just didn't care that he had done that to us. That he had immensely broken my trust. No remorse, just shifting the blame to her. Which she was at fault, but he played an integral role and did not want to see that. It hurt so bad and I still haven't recovered, nor have I forgiven my dad for it. His behavior has not changed in that regard, obviously since he kept in contact with her and is trying to force me into being around her or have a relationship with her", "That's fair. I'm going to talk to him and make things clear so everything is on the table and we can all make informed decisions.  See where his priorities really are", "NTA.

Luckily, my partner & I meshed incredibly well & I--organically--had somewhere new to build a life. Without my partner--despite my dad's immense love for me--I would have had nowhere solid to go. He spent nearly 30 years with a woman who constantly & magnificently upheaved his life, so who was I to protest? I mistakenly get like I owed him, despite him choosing his own path. \n\nAnyway, back on track. \n\nI gently suggest you find a place that will allow you & your kiddos to stay in the unfortunate, unthinkable event that you are forced to leave your current home.

Honestly it was surreal to go from giving CPR and catching EMTs up to speed, getting out of the way so they can administer narcan, and then breathe, walk outside and distract the kids and start playing with them. It took me so long to recover from that, so many therapy sessions to work through it, to stop the flashbacks and anxiety... it was messed up. I stayed because he said it wouldn't happen again. \n\nAnd here we are. Him wanting me to potentially go through it again with having not done any work to show me things are different. It just doesn't work that way, and I'm not sorry about that.", "I know exactly what you mean. I have said not to bring her over and as far as I know he hasn't.

And the fact that she has called you 'hooker' says that she probably did hook  in order to pay for her drug habit. \n\nWhich I would want to see her criminal record to see what all crimes she has committed and use that as a reason not to let her near your kids.\n\n You don't owe her a second chance.   She owes you an apology, though.", "It's 211 not 311! 211 is the helpline run by the United Way", "I feel for you\ud83d\udda4 Addiction is a terrible thing and has a very strong ripple effect. It makes the other people in an addict\u2019s life have to make really hard choices, I\u2019ve been there myself, but at the end of the day you just gotta do what\u2019s best for your kids! I wish you so much luck and happiness!", "I\u2019m really sorry, that is such a non-pology even accounting for upset at the time. Guessing you may have paid for the ambulance too? \n\nI hope you get some support with dealing with this. That sounds like it haunts you in a variety of ways. And you are very right to keep your boundary. Good luck!", "I'm sorry he's felt the need to bring such undeserving people into the fold, but I'm sure you'll do what's best for you & your kiddos. I hope you & yours have a happy, fulfilling life. \ud83d\udc9b", "No he doesn't. He only cared they got caught. And was emboldened when no one did call CPS on me. He didn't think it was a big as I was \"making it\"  and I haven't forgiven him for it either.", "That's what I told my dad \"I saved her life.. I think that's all I need to do for her.\" \n\nI still don't know what her criminal history is, and if she stays away from my kids idgaf honestly.", "Thank you. And yes it's so hard to have my view of my dad shaken to the core like that. It's hard to come to terms", "No fortunately I didn't have to pay for the ambulance. But you're right that I still do have after effects of this, and they're really flared because of this whole shitstorm now.", "Thank you. Yes I would do anything for them, and that includes cutting out my own dad if he is going to put them in danger.", "I don't doubt that! Self-preservation is never wrong or selfish. You've got this.\n\nEdit: and y'all will definitely find your safe, loving place, too! Sometimes we find ourselves traveling across stepping stones on our path to home. That's absolutely okay."]}
