Fake names used. \n\nTw: talk of OD\n\nSo my (29F) dad, Ryan (63M) had a friend over last year named Alicia (37F). This is how that visit went:\n\nI was on a walk down our road when he drives by with Alicia. They stopped and she said something along the lines of \"I didn't know they had h00kers this far out.\" Literally the first words she said to me. I didn't really respond to her and just got in the truck and thanked dad for the ride back because my foot was hurting (I was recovering from a foot surgery).\n\nMy kids (5m, 6f at this time) were still at school but would be back in a couple hours. So we go back to the house and I go back to work (I WFH in my bedroom) and they start hanging out. No big deal. A while later dad knocks on my door asking if I want an icecream, and I take a Klondike and go back to work. I don't even get through half of my ice-cream when my dad starts knocking hard/urgently on my door. I open it and he says he needs my help. As he steps back I see Alicia passed out on the floor. She had OD'd. I know it was wrong now, but I helped him move her to his bedroom because the kids were due home any minute. \n\nDad is freaking out and I'm telling him to call an ambulance and he's pushing back on that because she has warrants. I said that's a stupid f*ck\u00a1ng reason to let someone die and call for it myself. The ambulance and everyone comes minutes after the bus let's my kids off. They take her to hospital and I kept the kids outside away from all of that mess. \n\nSo I tell him that will NEVER happen around my kids EVER AGAIN. I thought we had an understanding of why that was traumatic and not something I want my kids around.\n\nSo fast forward to last week and he brings Alicia up in conversation again, basically fielding my response. And it was the same. Hell no. Not ever. He says she's clean now and I told him I just don't care. If he wants to be around her, that's his deal, but my kids and I will NEVER be in that situation again. No. Not again. I'm shaking just remembering that day. He says I'm AH for not giving her a second chance and I said he's an AH for wanting to put us through that again. And also the age gap just churns my stomach, sorry but it does. \n\nWell today he lets slip that he's DATING her... or \"dating this 38 yo woman\" rather. I put 2 and 2 together. \n\nThe whole thing makes me feel like I'm crazy.

He is a grown man who needs to learn to respect your decision and boundaries.", "Definitely NTA\n\nThis is some very serious stuff that is going on and it is right of you to be concerned for the well being of your children. And even if you do plan on meeting her then it should be after you have met her and made your own consensus. But it's definitely better for you to not let her near your kids at all", "NTA!!! The safety of your young children is paramount. Good on you for setting boundaries. Maybe you can revisit this issue in, like, a decade, if Alicia has built up a substantial record of responsibility and reliability in that time, but you don\u2019t subject little kids to \u201csecond chances\u201d with potentially unsafe people. \n\nDo you and your dad live together? If so, I would consider trying to find a new living situation if it is at all feasible if he\u2019s going to continue dating this women because odds are this is going to be an ongoing issue.", "NTA for feeling how you feel or for wanting to shelter your kids.  However, people do get clean and recover from addiction.  And, taking super creepy age gap out of the equation, if it is your father's house, he can choose to have her over anyway.", "Hell I don't want to be anywhere near my dad's girlfriend without any of that kind of shit happening at all. Or even meeting her at the first place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your dad has seriously questionable judgement, and I don't think you are even remotely unreasonable in refusing to have this person around your kids again. Also, she has a substance use disorder and the substance she uses can OD you, and magically less than a year after having a serious OD she's cured? Nope.", "Protecting your kids is your #1 priority.  NTA .", "NTA. Part of getting clean for most people is apologizing for all the shit you pulled while actively feeding your addiction. She skipped on the part where she takes accountability for the trauma she put you through. I\u2019d not let her in my house either. \n\nMy parents had a huge age gap so that doesn\u2019t bother me but if it\u2019s been not even a year yet and she is back to hanging out with people she used to get high with, I wouldn\u2019t count on this being a healthy relationship OR on his assurance that she is sober.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been there too, sadly, and your story makes me feel for you in solidarity. I\u2019ve witnessed someone OD, violently, and would never wish it upon anyone, especially not children. It\u2019s terrifying, life-altering, and not something they should ever have to see, and you are right to fiercely protect them from it. Good on you.", "NTA- your kids come first.", "NTA. Seriously, your dad has issues and you need to go full no contact with him. His life choices right now are highly questionable. You're 100% correct in keeping your kids away from it.", "NTA, but you might want to look into getting some NARCAN to have on hand. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this!", "Is this your home or your Fathers? You did not provide that info. If this is your Fathers home then he has the right to have her there. And if so I would be  moving. I think you are a level headed person and smart to call the ambulance. I am sure that was horrid for everyone. If your Father is living in your home kick him out if he brings her there. The age gap is nothing. I think the name she called you was tacky and uncalled for. I am not sure if you are TA without knowing the rest of the story.", "NTA. Another case of an old guy trying to relive his youth by dating a much younger woman. You have the right to protect yourself and you kids from the consequences of his actions.", "NTA keep your kids and you safe", "NTA. Good on you for wanting your kids away from that mess.", "NTA.\nNot only does she insult you at the first meeting but she ODs in your home? \nYou are completely justified in banning your kids from ever seeing her even if they end up married. \nIt\u2019s not clear if you live with your dad or he lives with you or if you\u2019re just roommates. Obviously you can\u2019t ban your roommates gf nor can you lay such boundaries if you\u2019re living with your dad so this only works if he\u2019s living with you.", "\u201cYour dad said, \u201cShe\u2019s clean now.\u201d  I don\u2019t think that a person can be declared clean one week after overdosing in another person\u2019s home.

You can't tell him what guests he can have in his home, but you can if it's your house (or yours together).", "INFO, you live together? Do you both pay rent? I'm confused as how you plan on never seeing her if he's dating her. Are you forbidding him from bringing her to his house?", "Thankfully they didn't see anything other than flashing lights. I kept them behind the house playing games and taking a nature walk. \n\nBut I did. I sat with her while the EMTs were coming giving CPR and on the phone. He didn't know what to do and was mad that I had called until her saw how lifeless she was.", "That's what I thought as well. I could meet her after they've been together for 6months continuously and then if that goes well I check back in after another 6 months. I'm not telling him NOT to Date her, even though I really don't approve, but that my kids and I will not be a part of it", "We do live together. I'm going to college to be an xray tech so once I have that career set up I can afford to live on my own. Right now I'm a part time sub teacher, so not the best salary.\n\nAnd yes, if there were more time to her being clean i would have been more receptive to meeting her someone neutral, and without the kids of course", "Yes, I know and some of my best friends have recovered from addiction. But I'm not convinced she is so soon. \n\nAnd I know he can have whoever over, I just told him that if he has her over the kids and I will go somewhere else for the evening. But he doesn't want that lol I have never had a good relationship with any of his partners", "he can certainly choose to have her over anyway but that makes him the asshole whether it\u2019s his house or not to expose his own grandchildren to a potentially unsafe situation", "Also: dad is 100% using. I'm super sorry, but if he lives with you, you need to be super careful that his room isn't full of his stash--especially with kids in the house.", "Thats why I'm pushing back so hard. I just do not believe it. But it's his life, yknow. I just reinforced that we won't be part of that. Going to move out as soon as possible once I'm done with school. \n\nIf he wants to have her over, I just asked him for a notice so I can take the kids and myself somewhere else", "It always has been and always will be. I've cut out my own partners when I realized they weren't good for them. And that was someone I knew since school. But they're gone now and I don't regret it.", "Yeah it doesn't sit right with me. And his track record for women is not great. At best, they are shitty people and worst they're abusive and contributed to my cptsd", "I'm sorry you went through this too. Sometimes I have flashbacks to seeing her on the floor. Or how her chest felt during the compressions. \n\nAnd rhen to go outside and distract my kids like nothing had happened", "Can't go NC because we live together. But once I'm done with school I'm moving out", "It's his house, but he considers it half mine as well as we were planning on making an addition. Now I'm not sure I want to do this long term. He had asked if she could come over to meet everyone, but then it came out that she was staying over. Which hadn't been yhe plan, but that didn't happen anyway since she OD'd", "Thats what I'm thinking too. I told him if he wants a bachelor lifestyle, then please let me move out first", "I am sorry that you are made to feel guilty for looking after your kids safety by your own father. But it's for the best, you are NTA OP!", "They are your children and you have all the rights to make sure that they are safe", "Yeah I yhink I was trying to lie to myself that he just got caught up with the wrong crowd, but it's a pattern. As soon as I can afford it, we are moving out", "Good for you. Stand firm, OP!", "The flashbacks can be intense and difficult. They live so vividly in your mind.\n\nBut take comfort in knowing you did the right thing. You got her help when she needed it, even though your dad wrongly discouraged it. And by keeping your children away from the situation, you spared them from being subjected to the same pain you\u2019re feeling.", "Thank you. He didn't think it was a big deal when it happened", "Yeah thankfully I had been in a lot of therapy to be able to spot the gaslighting and not let it affect me. Draw firm boundaries and stand by them", "Good--I saw that you are studying for your XRT certification! That's awesome--you might start looking into what resources are available that could get you and kids out sooner. Sometimes depending on your area there's support funding for housing/expenses when you are retraining, especially with kids in the mix. If you're in the US I'd start by calling 311 and figuring out what kind of services are available.", "Thank you. I will", "That's what I'm clinging to in this situation. That the only reason he can date her now is because I stepped in and saved her life. I just don't want to be around her again. And he doesn't care that it scarred me, and that hurts", "So how often does your dad OD?", "Is it a possibility to find another living situation so that you don\u2019t have to see her again, even if your dad does continue to date her?", "I don't think he has yet, or at least since I've been alive. He did cocaine back in the day. But moved across country to get clean himself.", "I told him that if he has her over then my kids and I will go stay with  my brother that weekend. And if he moves her in without my consent, then I told him I'd rather go to a shelter. I don't know how far he'll go for this woman, but I doubt it would come to that. But I also have made some friends here who may be able to help us if it does come to pass", "I don't think it worked :(", "I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have a safer alternative at the moment.\n\nIf I may, can I suggest getting some Narcan, or at least suggest it to your dad, especially because he doesn\u2019t want to call 911? I believe hospitals, police, social services, and other such places often offer it for free. The cops even gave me a little Overdose Kit to keep around after this happened to my friend.\n\nAlso, maybe a \u201cgo bag\u201d for you and the kids? If the situation presents itself again and you need to bolt out of there? Just a thought.\n\nFeel free to PM if you\u2019d like to chat. I really hope this works itself out, Alicia gets the help she needs, and your dad comes to an understanding and reconciliation of how traumatizing this has been for you."]}
