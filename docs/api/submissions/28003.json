We both have families, both have parents (thankfully) and WE are a family in any case and our desire to spend holidays together is just as valid as anyone else's. \n\nPoint being, you're right.

Tell your boss or HR about retaliation after your refusal to work for yourself and extra for Ava.", "When your boss said \"figure it out\", he pretty much meant for you to do her work for her. Welcome to the world of the childless employee in today's workplace. Your life is not as important as anyone else's because you do not have children, the only thing that is of any value in the eyes of many people with children.

What makes them think you're up for working that much overtime when they refuse to do the same? NTA but your coworkers are.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYour colleagues' request was unreasonable. It's not your responsibility to cover for Ava's absence, especially if it means working extra hours without compensation.

Your colleagues and Ava should understand that it's the company's responsibility to ensure the work is managed properly.", "NTA.

Sounds stupid to say that about an office job but one slip on a tile floor and you'll suddenly see the point.\n\nAs for all the married people coming down on you... Remind them that they have spouses to help them out. You don't have anyone, and what's more you are never going to have anyone if you're constantly busy working because you need time to find someone.
