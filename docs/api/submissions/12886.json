Your friend sounds really misguided in the relationship and yes, it was dumb to date him and think his mental illness was some \"quirk\" as you put it. But also, as a friend, you didn't have to call her a dumbass or arrogant. That was a pretty shitty thing to do. Especially when your friend is expressing to you that she's being abused.", "NTA", "NTA. Generally speaking, I think when a friend comes to you in a moment of \u201cI fucked up, please help,\u201d it is better to be kind than to be right.\n\nThat being said, your friend was extremely naive and overconfident about this relationship, and was condescending towards you when you tried to warn her about trying to \u201cfix\u201d this guy. Now, she\u2019s complaining about how unhealthy her relationship is/how unhappy it\u2019s making her, but still has no intention of leaving, because she still doesn\u2019t get that she can\u2019t change the way this guy\u2019s brain functions. \n\nWhile I still don\u2019t recommend putting her on blast, (however rewarding that may feel, and right though you may have been,) I do recommend you consider whether *your* relationship with her is worth maintaining. \n\nDoes she always treat you this way/make disparaging comments towards you often? Because, while you can try to use grey rocking and other techniques to set boundaries with her to prevent her from sapping your emotional energy, I honestly wonder if you should try to keep this \u201cfriendship\u201d at all. \n\nSorry, but a real, good friend wouldn\u2019t mock and belittle you for expressing concern for her happiness and well-being.", "ESH\n\nYour friend for being, well, a dumbass. But rose colored glasses can mask red flags, even when they're plain as the nose on your face.\n\nYou are *definitely* TA because your friend needs you right now and all you wanted to do was rub her nose in a big fat \"I told you so!\" -- that doesn't make you right. That just makes you a bad friend.", "NAH - as awkward as that sounds.  \n\nIt's a difficult life lesson to have to learn.  However, the truly tragic thing is your friends needs to fix herself more then she needs to fix him.  \n\nThis is an unhealthy couping mechanism in humans. \n\nThey find someone that needs to be saved or fixed.  Becuase if they have someone to fix.  They do not have to fix themselves.  Which is a very scary thing to confront. It requires sacrifice and change.  So enter the fixer upper!\n\nSomeone more in need of help and in need of fixing!  So of course.  They is all sorts of adult tantrums, mistreatment, fit throwing, and childish manipulation.  You are dealing with a child that refuses to take responsibility and as long as someone is there to feel sorry for them and play parent.  They will continue to act like a child.  \n\nCalling her a dumbass?  That was you being honest with her.  Could you have said it nicer?  If I was to chop limp or pull a tooth.  You wouldn't even have a spine or jaw.  You would have no arms or legs and be toothless.  So I am not going to fault you for being honest.\n\nAs for your friend.

Uh huh...\n\nWell she's not going to get out of this easily either way. Emotional & mental abuse and manipulation does a number on a person.

You're a bad friend.

OP needs to set boundaries so she doesn't hear about their relationship troubles 24/7, help her make a plan to leave in a non-judgemental way, or take space from the friend if needed.
