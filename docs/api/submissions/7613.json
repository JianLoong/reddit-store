Hell, she's older than you. Expecting her to be mature enough to contribute to your expenses is not you being an asshole. You even said part-time is fine. It's not like youre badgering her to find a job that pays really well.\n\nI say, think long and hard whether you want to really be with someone who just wants to let you do all the work.

When she refused to go to work when the youngest was 2 I was done.\n\nSo much better off. More money and the kids and I are happier.\n\nI left her 5 years ago. She was with another dude within the week. She's been with him 5 years. Her only income is the child support I pay and it's 400 bucks and I have them 3 days a week during school and 5 days when they are out.\n\nNow my daughtersare complaining they don't wanna go back to their moms because all they do over there is listen to the guy yell at their mom for being lazy and not working...", "NTA you need to reevaluate this relationship. It will not get better after a wedding.", "NTA you have let her sponge way to long! She should be working full time no reason she can\u2019t. I can\u2019t stand women like this they make us all look bad", "NTA. And if this is how she is I doubt you want to marry that.", "NTA- she is using you as a cash cow.", "Question. Does she take care of things inside the home that you don\u2019t help with such as cooking, cleaning, laundry etc? Because if she does, then YTA because that is a full time job. If you split **all** household chores equally, then you\u2019re NTA and she absolutely needs to find a job.", "NTA dude this is your future.  Good news she showed her colors before you got married. If this is not what you want and she doesn't want to change.... is this a hard decision?", "NTA. You have clearly stated your needs/ expectations. Tell her no wedding without a job, give her six months to find one. Kick her out and break up with her if she doesn\u2019t comply.", "NTA. This is not going to work out.", "NTA throw the couch potat out before it grows spuds and roots to bind you to its useless being.", "NTA just ask her to move out. She is not contributing to this relationship", "So many questions....... NTA. You need to have a hard discussion. Hit her with the, \"we need to talk\". I think you need to drop this relationship. Thank God there is no child.", "The fun thing about supporting a spouse on a single income in today's world is it makes it even more difficult to retire, since you need to simultaneously make enough money to keep yourselves going *and* save enough for two people to live on for 20-odd years.  Our friend who has a nonworking spouse is constantly freaking out about how he's the only thing standing between his family and financial ruin.  It's shitty.", "That\u2019s why men should never get married in modern times. There is zero benefits, but many costs", "Nta.  Having a sahs is a terrible idea,  almost all of the time.   It destroys relationships because Resentiment destroys relationships.  \n\nThere\u2019s literally no reason she needs to not work.  She just doesn\u2019t want to.  Well fuck.  I don\u2019t want to either.  Where\u2019s my sugar daddy?  \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.\n\nYou're not telling her what to do, you're telling her what you won't do. Perfect.", "NTA. You have no obligation to support her just because she doesn't want a job. Make her start paying rent/utilities, and start re-evaluating your relationship. Seems like she might not be a reliable partner in the future, and you certainly won't want to be sharing your income with her down the road, especially if you get divorced.", "NTA  \n\n\nThere is this [Pearl of Wisdom](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi91u_6_dD8AhXDQvEDHaStAIsQyCl6BAgXEAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLH-i8IvYIcg&usg=AOvVaw1l_s01tJ5Kv_U20oGgJ6Lb)", "NTA you waited 2 years!!!!  Tell her there will be no marriage until she works and contributes to the home and bills. Otherwise you will live separately engaged or married (thats if you still want a relationship with someone this lazy).\n\nStop being used like this. You're not a doormat. How on earth have you tolerated 2 years whilst working 50-60 hrs?\n\nAlso dont link it to marriage- link it to the whole relationship - you will not have a stay at home partner anymore.  Its a partnership. She isnt your child. She hasnt become disabled. You aren't a trust fund millionaire who doesnt need to work for his money, and this is an actual relationship not transaction where she gets money in return of being with you.", "NTA.", "NTA, I would have said Y T A if she was cleaning and cooking and stuff, but just smoking weed is not a reason to let another person pay for you.\n\nGet ther f outta there.", "NTA, you wanted a partner, not a sugar baby.", "NTA but this is why you always discuss stuff like this before you move in and get married. Now you know and need to assess the relationship.", "she promised and didn\u2019t deliver then act a fool when you question why. Nta", "NTA\n I'm reading this and thinking to myself, \"This sounds like my daughters life.\"  Unfortunately, there is now a baby involved, and she is going through a divorce. \nMy advice to you is to run as fast as you can.  Find someone else who will work with you as a partner in life.  Remember this saying, \"You want a puller, not a rider, as a life partner.\"", "NTA. Y\u2019all need to get on the same page ASAP or seriously reconsider the engagement.\n\nINFO: Is \u201cnot having a stay at home wife\u201d a principled stance, or was that a reaction to her being stay at home?\n\nAn amazing stay at home spouse with no kids doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to me. However, she\u2019s not a great example with the two of you splitting chores 50-50 and her smoking week in the house during the day (normal?).", "Dude why are you in this relationship? She's freeloading off you and intends to continue doing this. Get out man. NTA", "Well she needs to go, for sure. She was probably raised to let a man take care of her. I was too, but I got over myself. You didn\u2019t phrase it that well, but you\u2019re NTA.", "This will end your relationship one way or the other.  If you think you resent her now, just wait a few years.  I was a SAHM but I always worked part time around the kids, and my husband grew to resent that I didn't bring in the same amount of money. \n\n GF isn't doing JACK, and there are plenty of jobs to be had. End it.", "NTA. You are looking for a partner not a dependent. She's an adult deciding without your consent that you will carry 100% of the financial responsibility for both of you.  \n\nWhat happens if you get injured on the job? What are her plans for saving for retirement or emergencies?\n\nOn the bright side, you aren't married yet so there's no alimony or further loss of savings/assets.", "NTA\n\n\nGirl is taking advantage of you. Things are not looking great for your relationship since you guys have opposite expectations. \n\n\n\nYou should just run as this is a major red flag.", "NTA the tradition of women not having a job is fucking weird. It's either oppressing or spoiled", "NTA some people have a vision of what it means/looks like to be a fiance/spouse/parent and it may not align with their partners's view/ expectations. This can end up being a non negotiable difference. Only you can communicate with each other to determine that. If you can't agree, it may be time to go your separate ways. ETA, her friends opinion don't matter a whit.", "NTA, I think you found yourself an entitled freeloader.", "NTA\n\nThere's no way I'd marry that. The attitude. The drugs. You can do a lot better. I doubt she'll suddenly become great marriage material.", "NTA. Time to look for a new girlfriend.", "Yea this is definitely things you discuss before you get married. NTA - You hit a nerve cause it\u2019s true. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you left out from the two years, what\u2019s she been saying to progressively stay this way without discussing it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I were her, people don\u2019t discuss this after marriage\u2026what was she expecting?", "NTA you need a partner, not a dependent. Don't marry her unless she is willing to be that.", "NTA. If there's no kids at home then there's just not enough to do around the house to have someone be a house spouse.", "Dude. Get out od that fast. Run .", "NTA\n\nDude you don't have a gf, you have a leech.", ">why, we aren't even married yet\n\nYour response should have been \"good point, why am I supporting you then? Everything 50/50 from now on or you move out\"", "NTA\n\nDid you communicate that 6 month expectation to her? Letting the situation go this long as left her feeling entitled to said situation. The two of you need to have a conversation about expectations, yours being she finds a job. \n\nGetting her friends involved is low. Are you sure this is the right girl for you, long term?", "NTA.   I couldn't carry an able-bodied man on my back and still have respect for him.   I just couldn't.     \n\n\nIf she does manage to find a job, she won't keep it.   She'll half-ass the job until they fire her, or she'll find some reason to quit.", "NTA. Be careful, OP, your gf is a taker, not a giver, and in some states, common law marriage kicks in after 2 years.", "Take a step back and find the why. Is it just the money, or other things that bother you. If she checks all the boxes, except for being a housewife. Compromise with her. A lot of remote jobs out there, she can do a few hours a day. If she completely changed when she moved in, run. People these days, value money over love. That is why divorce rates are so high.\n\nCommunicate with her on why. A few friends had housewives, but now they are the bread winner. The wives wanted to try it, both are teachers, and got their degree online.", "For real. She sounds like a total bum.", "my concern would be she'd play along until after the wedding then quit. I'd make sure she has no access to any of your money and has to find her own spending money.  bottom line, dump her", "But,  what\u2019s the point of staying with someone who expects to be a freeloader?  What\u2019s the end goal of staying in a relationship that is very clearly doomed?", "Disagree on the housework thing; even if she does all the housework, that's not nearly comparible to him working all day, 50-60 hour weeks. Would be different if they had kids, but the current circumstances, he's not the AH.", "There's not enough housework to fill a full work week.", "You\u2019ve got to put spaces or something between the Y T A so that the bot doesn\u2019t count it against OP when tallying up votes", "I don\u2019t think taking care of the house is a full time job if they don\u2019t have kids (different story with kids in the picture). \n\nAll single adults living by themselves manage to do both work and housework.", "\u2026seriously? Did you just completely skip over the part where OP HAS spoken up and gets met with outright refusal?", "Exactly. You want to be a SAHM and he doesn't want that, you can't agree on what to do for kids, don't get married. World views should be aligned with little to no difference.", "I disagree as well. Doing all the housework still wouldn't match with the 50-60 hours he puts into work. She still would have way more free time than him, especially if she's good at her time management.", "It seems like they're not having kids so she'd not even be a sahm. I get that working full time and doing all the cooking and cleaning and laundry seems like a lot to do, but this isn't that. He's asking her to... Be an adult who lives in the house as an equal adult? I personally don't understand how you can have no job and no kids and no major tasks and feel fulfilled but I guess each to their own? Op is nta though, obviously", "He must buy her weed too.", "NTA, you shouldn't do any housework since she's home and there's no kids.  Did she work before she moved in?  She sounds like a freeloader and i'd kick her to the curb.  You're being used, this isn't a partnership."]}
