Prior to moving she had a job and held her own.  Since she was the one moving I said to take your time and get situated.  I make enough to pay our bills.  I figured 6 months, maybe a year.  Here we are 2 years later.  I've been trying to gently push her to get a job.  Not full time, just part time.  I'm met with outright refusal now when I bring it up.  I've been getting sick of it since I work between 50 and 60 hours a week.  It came to a head last week.  I came home to a house that reeked of weed and I snapped and told her to get a job.  She got pissed and said why, we aren't even married yet.  That's when I said I will not have a stay at home wife.  She blew up on me and now I'm dealing with shitty messages from her friends.  Fyi, no kids I'm snipped and she's likely infertile.

If you aren't married yet and she's acting like this, I doubt if it'll get any better.   Might be good to re-evaluate this relationship.", "NTA\n\nWhat would make you an asshole? That you aren\u2019t continually finically supporting a fully independent adult for the rest of your life? Idk what her and her friends are smoking but it must be the good stuff.", "NTA.  You're allowed to decide that you don't want a relationship in which you're depended upon to be the sole breadwinner.\n\nBut you do realize that you'll have to actually take action and just end the relationship, right?  You can't force people to be who you want them to be, so at some point you need to live in the reality you have and realize you're just not compatible.", "100% NTA , actually I think you are too nice, I mean you\u2019re not even married and she\u2019s unemployed and relying on you for money for 2 years? If you marry her now she won\u2019t ever get a job, you were absolutely right saying you don\u2019t want a SAHW.", "NTA suggest you get her to move out as soon as possible. Would not chose the marriage route.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to decide you\u2019ll support her indefinitely. That\u2019s a two yes/one no situation. I suggest you two have a conversation about this where you either get on the same page or break up. Drawing this out won\u2019t go well for anyone.", "NTA:  she's using you man snd now using her friends to try to support her ridiculous wants", "NTA - your decision if she\u2019s worth being a free loader. I doubt she is since you\u2019re here. Kick her to the curb.", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you.", "NTA. Get rid, she's a mooch.", "NTA, you already know it. Obviously you like her if it\u2019s gone on for 2 years so I\u2019m not jumping on the \u201cdump her\u201d train", "Kick her out. Stay together but not live together. She can pay her own way. NTA.", "Definitely NTA! This was talked about as a temporary situation, you've been more than patient. She needs to find a job or get out.", "NTA. Is there any legitimate reason why she can't or why it would be harder for her to get a job? Like maybe a sickness or something?\n\nIf not, and the reason is merely because of outright refusal to work, then thats all on her.\n\nYoure her boyfriend and possibly future partner not her sugar daddy or parent. Hell, she's older than you. Expecting her to be mature enough to contribute to your expenses is not you being an asshole. You even said part-time is fine. It's not like youre badgering her to find a job that pays really well.\n\nI say, think long and hard whether you want to really be with someone who just wants to let you do all the work. There's really no reason either for a wife to be stay at home (provided she has no work at home arrangements either) if you dont even have kids, unless you both agree on it for some reason. Clearly you're not.", "NTA. You don't have to choose a lifetime of supporting someone else. Definitely don't marry someone who expects to be a SAHW if you don't want to be the sole provider. Sounds like you aren't compatible.", "NTA. Where is her drive? Your demands are not unreasonable. Although I do worry she could be depressed if she\u2019s that unmotivated. Might need to dig deep on the root feelings of why she is being so defensive but her response Isn\u2019t normal. my husband is currently not working due to health concerns but he wants to and he does so much for me around the house while we wait for a diagnosis. I can\u2019t picture him just sitting around for the fun of it. He desperately misses work. But your partner sounds like she\u2019s pretty healthy and just taking advantage of you and either being lazy or entitled. Neither is a good look", "NTA\n\nShe agreed to getting a job after she moved in with you and she needs to abide by that.   She needs to pull her weight and contribute.  \n\nHold off on any commitments until you see results", "NTA. And why would you continue to support this free loading woman for two years?  Apparently she sees you as an ATM and you have obliged her. \nShe believes that because you can support her, you should.  She isn\u2019t looking for a partnership, she just wants someone to take care of her.\nI don\u2019t know why, after two years, you think there\u2019s a chance in hell of her getting a job.  If you still want to continue this engagement give her an end date and if she doesn\u2019t have a job, pack her bags and put her out. I hope your house isn\u2019t in her name.  If she has access to your money, change it now.", "NTA, and tell her friends to fuck off.", "NTA. Well, maybe a bit for letting 2 years of your life go into supporting this mooch.", "NTA \n\nEvict her. Two years is more than enough time to find some kind of work. She doesn't want to work and she's not going to work.", "NTA. It also sounds like you\u2019re really here to find out if you should stay in the relationship.\n\nYou can\u2019t force change. Getting married isn\u2019t a light switch that will suddenly turn on her motivation and responsibility. Think about your future.", "What does getting married have to do with her getting a job? She's sponging off of you, plain and simple. Does she even buy groceries or cook and clean the house or do you do all that, too? \n\nYou have at least two things in your favor. You're not married and you don't have kids with her. Good thing, because she's showing you who she is loud and clear. \n\nNTA but perhaps you might want to reconsider what you're getting out of this relationship because it sounds like she views you as her ticket to freeload.", "NTA dude, get rid of her. I promise you can do better.", "You can do better than an indolent bedwarmer. Find a real woman. NTA", "INFO:  Is she taking care of the household chores?", "NTA but I'd seriously rethink the relationship.  Otherwise take her as she is, because she isn't going to change.", "NTA\n\nCut off all of her access to your money.  Stop giving her money and paying for her bills.  She needs a reason to work.  \n\nAnd you really need to stop any plans to marry this woman.  She's a mooch and just wants to be your long term dependent.", "NTA. She\u2019s a mooch. Don\u2019t get married", "NTA. At all, completely. I came here and saw \"I will not have a stay at home wife\" and thought 'hoo boy, this guy's a clown' until I read it. Wow. If she's been sitting around and smoking weed at home for 2 YEARS, I would be righteously pissed. And now her friends are after you? This isn't a fair situation to you. NTA.", "NTA....let her go. You want a partner and she wants a parent. Tell the friends to take her in once you boot her out. Then block everyone and move on", "NTA. You\u2019re well within your rights to determine how your money will be used. If you don\u2019t want to keep paying for a stay at home girlfriend, you don\u2019t have to. If this sort of situation comes up again in the future, though, you might want to give a timeframe upfront.", "Nta You need to run as fast as u can seriously and thank your lucky stars that you didn\u2019t actually get married to her what do you think once you get married that this is gonna change no she\u2019s showing you her true colors now and once you get married it\u2019ll get a lot worse run dude before she ends up getting pregnant by \u201caccident \u201c I would formally give her 30 day notice you\u2019re better off without her stop wasting time on her you guys obviously don\u2019t see eye to eye and she\u2019s expecting to sit on her ass all day", "NTA - I would suggest seeing someone to arrange a leech removal ASAP because this situation has \"does not end well\" written all over it in 48 pt. type.", "NTA.  With no kids and absolutely zero reason for you having to support her I'd be pissed too.  Who does she think she is expecting a free ride through life?  She's due for a massive wake up call and her friends are morons as well.", "YTA for being a pushover. How do you live like that? And if I was dating someone and her friends started texting me shit I would ghost them all instantly. The shit y\u2019all put up with us ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\n>She got pissed and said why, we aren\u2019t married yet\n\nI don\u2019t get what being married have to do with her getting a job. That being said, 50-60 hour weeks??? OP take a break, holy shit man. \n\nYour SO is pretty much just freeloading. However, if she does do housework then YTA. If not, she is just freeloading. Wait, y\u2019all don\u2019t even have kids??? Oh yeah, she is just using you for a free roof over her head", "INFO: Has it been two years since you asked her to move and proposed? \n\nShe might not feel like you\u2019re holding up your end of the deal either. Sounds like you two need to have a conversation.", "NTA. DTMFA.", "YTA, but only for the terrible communication skills you appear to have.  You've been 18 months past the agreed on time for her employment and if you haven't spoken up during that time, she might reasonably have concluded you were okay with the status quo.

It's all good if that's what both people want and can be equitable if the stay-at-home partner takes on a lot of the house work. Generally that does include raising kids but if she literally took care of everything some people might be ok with it. Still reasonable to not be cool with it.\n\nFrom the sounds of it she just decided one day that she can leech. Like no job and not trying to do all the chores is a great way for her to ruin things.
