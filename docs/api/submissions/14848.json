Despite this, they had never made me feel different or never made me feel like they were friends with me because of my money. We would go to dinners and outings and I would contribute as much as everyone else even though I can easily pay for everyone without any issues. Of course, I often felt bad and would give a little more or would offer to pay for drinks for everyone. But they never asked. They were always just happy and accepted when I offered to pay for something which was almost every time. \n\nThe other day, I got the opportunity to see 2 of them over dinner. It was all going well and we were all reminiscing our college days. We talked about a friend in the group that we were missing, \u201cLana\u201d. They all talked about how she was able to turn her life around by starting a new career in another country and how amazing it is. They kind of had an inkling that I helped finance her move so she can start a new life. Then \u201cDanny\u201d asked me if I helped her out financially. I said yes. He asked me exactly how much and I was honest with them. I explained that I made Lana sign a contract that clearly stated that she had to pay everything back within 1 year. She paid everything back within 6 months. The rest of the night went by and we all had a lot of fun.\n\nThe very next day, \u201cDanny\u201d asked me for the for the exact same amount that I helped \u201cLana\u201d with. He and his girlfriend wanted to borrow the money. But instead of 6 months, they wanted to pay it back in 2 years. I was shocked. Apparently he and his gf are heavily in debt and the interests are piling up and they are struggling to pay the bank back. I know that the amount isn\u2019t really that much to me but it could really help them out of a deep hole. \n\nI don\u2019t trust him I was happy to help my other friend because I had lent her a lot of money in the past and she always paid back in full on time or even earlier. Danny has been the complete opposite. He has never paid back the small or large amounts I let him borrow. The last one was when he borrowed 500\u20ac from me and he always gave a reason for why he couldn\u2019t pay it back yet. I kind of just stopped asking for the sake of our friendship then we all just kind of \u201cforgot\u201d about it. I never did though. From then on, I decided that I  would never let him borrow anything. \n\nSo I said no and gave him a reason that I didn\u2019t have the money at the moment. I do, I just didn\u2019t want to be honest with him about why I was saying no. I feel really bad. The guilt is eating me alive and I can\u2019t function properly. But I also know that if I let him \u201cborrow\u201d money, I would just be giving that money away and I would never see it again. Money I am working hard for every day. I may have grown up privileged but I am not relying on my parents anymore and I work hard for what I have. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681558391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mzbus/aita_for_not_lending_money/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It cost you more than 500E to find that out. Don't throw any more money down that hole.\n\n>he and his gf are heavily in debt and the interests are piling up and they are struggling to pay the bank back\n\nSee? It's a hole. The bank is about to find that out. Let Danny experience the consequences of his choices, along with the bank.\n\nAnd *never, ever, ever discuss \"finances\" with your friends again*. Especially loans you may have made to other people. I bet Lana would be simply *horrified* to learn that you blabbed her confidential personal financial details to mutual acquaintances over drinks. It's an even bigger betrayal given that she was respectful to you and paid your loan back promptly.\n\nNTA for not subsidizing Danny's bad financial decisions, now resolve to drop the subject of money FOREVER", "You made a significant mistake.  You NEVER talk about your finances with friends.  That's like Rookie Wealthy Move number 1. NEVER talk about your finances with anyone but your accountant.  \n\nYou are NTA. But you set yourself up for this. And it will color every relationship you have if you don't learn to stop talking about finances.  You do not owe anyone anything just because you have it.  Stop lending money to friends.  It's a power imbalance you can't overcome.  You're a friend, not an ATM.", "NTA. Keep future financial arrangements private and this will not become an issue. Just because someone asks doesn't mean you have to give out private information.", "NTA, he will never pay you back. And it isn't about can you affort to lose that amount of money or not. It is about what kind of \"friend\" he is. I don't think he is a real friend, just someone who wants to benefit from knowing you. You can't trust him.", "NTA\n\nLending money is a two way street. You were happy to lend your friend money because there was good honest history. \n\nDanny on the other hand has the opposite.   \n\nIf you lend him this money your friendship is over - you will never see it again and it will eat away at you more than this guilt. \n\nHe needs to not have this easy way out because that will mean he has to get the proper financial help he needs. \n\nI would be tempted to go so far as to tell him the real reason.", "NTA, your money, your rules. It's as simple as that.", "NTA\nYou are not lending him the money, because you already had a bad experience with him. He already proved, that he cannot be trusted regarding money. 500 EUR is a lot.", "NTA. You are not obligated just because they asked, even if they are responsible. In this case, it\u2019s worse cos the person has history of not repaying back.", "NTA.\nMy question is: would you trust him even if he had a contract? It sounds like he has screwed up on contracts having to do with money before. Trust your gut here. Offer to help in other ways? Maybe help him find a financial planner that can help him set up a budget and get out of debt", "NTA-you don\u2019t have to lend money. \n\nBut you are absolutely an AH. \n1) You violated Lana\u2019s trust. You are NOT supposed to reveal a financial relationship between you to others. You are the lender. She was the borrower. That is her story to reveal if she wants to. Even if she wouldn\u2019t care, it\u2019s still a violation of trust. \n\n2) You also told them how much she borrowed. That\u2019s insane to answer, especially to someone who has \u201cborrowed\u201d/stolen from you in the past. \n\n3) After all your claims of being honest, you don\u2019t want to be honest with you\u2019re so-called friend. Why didn\u2019t you say that you didn\u2019t want to lend because he had a history of not paying you back? That paying off debts is a behavior issue not a one-time need. That he has a SO involved in this mess. Really think deep down as to why that was hard for you to say. Stop letting this \u201cfriend\u201d beat you down. You\u2019re too non-confrontational. \n\nLastly, part of the problem here is that all you 20-somethings think it\u2019s appropriate to know each others\u2019 salaries and expenses. It is NOT appropriate. You shouldn\u2019t have any idea that you\u2019re the most \u201cwell off\u201d in your friend group, and neither should they. That\u2019s what leads to conversations like this, which you know don\u2019t like to handle, so make life easier for yourself and don\u2019t discuss money with anyone until you have a serious SO you\u2019re considering marrying.", "Obvious NTA, he\u2019s got a bad track record with money and you won\u2019t be well off for much longer if you flush money down the well", "NTA\n\nBut if you're struggling with the guilt,  I think maybe honesty is a better approach. Tell him that you have helped him in the past and he hasn't honored his commitment. You helping your friends is based on trust.", "NTA. It's called throwing good money after bad.  He hasn't paid you back the money he owes you and your only choice was to let it go or risk your \"friendship\". He literally has a contract with the bank and isn't paying them.\n\nI do think you should stop sharing  financial arrangements. If you want to say you helped her out, that's fine.  The details of your/her arrangement is really none of their business. I also think you need to stop lending money out outside of exceptional circumstances. I get wanting to help a friend out because your have more. You will eventually be seen less as a friend and more as a bank.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't have to lend or give it to anyone if you don't want to. You don't want to have to take this guy to court to get him to pay.", "NTA.\n\nRefuse. That guy has a terrible track record, it\u2019s like gifting him money, not lending him money.", "NTA. He is basically still in debt to you, so there is no reason for you to believe he would actually pay you back. It's normal to feel emphatic when someone you know is in trouble. But honestly it's not your problem. Just because you have more money doesn't mean that you're obliged to share it.\n\nHowever, if he is feeling up for open discussion about his debt etc and the loan you would give to him would get him out of it once and for all I would give it some thought. If he can pay all his debt at once and has a financial situation that allows to pay you back in 2 years, why not? But it would require for him to be honest with his situation, so you can determine if it's worth the risk for you.", "NTA For not lending money. However you should be honest and say you aren't lending money because he never paid you back in the past.", "NTA. You\u2019re very correct in not treating them the same. I had a colleague who would need some money occasionally because the company we worked for sometimes paid us late. So I would always help out with small amounts and he would always pay me back the second he got the money. (I know because my salary also got credited the same day) One day he asked for a much larger amount for a medical emergency and said he would pay me back in 3 months. I gave it without thinking twice. I got paid in 2 months. Those are the people who have integrity to pay you back no matter what and you can lend money with a light heart.", "YTA for discussing the terms of the loan with Lana, typically that's considered a private matter between the two parties. \n\nDanny is clearly not trustworthy, and if you're uncomfortable with his ask, you should trust your instincts. \n\nPersonally, I never loan money to friends, its always a gift. This way the friendship isn't changed by money.", "NTA. Your money to loan or not. You thought about it and decided what's best for you. Nothing wrong with saying no.", "NTA. Someone who borrows money with no intention of giving it back isn't a friend, they're a thief. Don't lend anything to them", "NTA, but I\u2019d tell Danny about how she always paid you back previously and he never has.", "NTA\n\nWarning: I suspect Danny will try to guilt-trip you by involving your friends in this situation. Be prapared. If they put you under pressure you should offer to lend a money... to them. Oficially and legally, of course. And they can lend it to Danny. If they want to be a part of this - let them, but on your terms.", "NTA. He's already shown you he can't be trusted with a small amount; why trust him with a large one?", "NTA. They want a lot more time to repay the debt and he hasn't paid when he borrowed before", "NTA - You're correct - Danny is trying to use you. There's a pretty good chance that if you loan him money, he'll spend it on \"fun stuff\". If you feel guilty, give him a couple hundred Euros and write it off. He'd come across pretty badly if he asked for more.", "Definitely NTA. You were right to not lend him that money, as he has already proved himself not to be trustworthy with you in the past. It would be one thing if this was something very important like hospital bills for a sick family member, but that's not the case. You are absolutely in the right for not wanting to put yourself in a situation where you could potentially lose more money and continue allowing him to mooch off you. You don't owe him anything and I don't think you should feel guilty for sticking to your principles", "NTA, though I think you should have told him the truth:  \"No loan for you because you haven't paid back the 500 I lent you before.\"", "NTA.  Stop beating yourself up about it. No one is entitled to your wealth,  and Danny's track record speaks for itself.", "This. Don't tell anyone what you make (except your partner or spouse). Don't get into details about your investments. Don't pick up the tab when you go out with friends (unless it's a special occasion and it's discussed in advance). Don't buy gifts that are more expensive than what is usually exchanged within the friend group. \n\nLending money to friends is ok, but only if you trust them to pay it back. It should be kept private (i.e. nobody else in the group should know about it). And there should never be any pressure. If someone asks and you decline, that should be the end of it, and any requests after that are a huge red flag.", "I would just add that OP could decide to help out their friend Danny by just giving them the money they're asking for or a portion of it. If it's not that much for them and it will be life-changing for the friend, it might be a worth move. Just don't le d any money expecting to be paid back.\n\nHowever, Danny's past behaviour seems to indicate that he has put himself in that position due to his own bad decision making, and will likely just squander op's money without resolving the underlying issues. OP shouldn't feel responsible for solving Danny's problems, since they are probably deeper than just immediate lack of money.\n\nAnd don't feel guilty, you're not at fault. Maybe consider donating to charity, as a way to share a bit of  your financial well being with the rest of tbe world."]}
