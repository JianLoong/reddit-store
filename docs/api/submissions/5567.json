I\u2019ll try to summarize and keep it as short and relevant as possible.\n\nThings really blew up after my post. There were multiple conversations between my husband and both his sisters and their mother. It did not go well. They basically told us they have had issues for years and this Christmas request was their final straw. We were shocked. We had no idea there were any previous issues or bad feelings from anyone. We just had a wonderful family wedding for one of his sisters in spring of this year and we all had a good time together. So to say my husband and I were shocked is an understatement.\n\nOf course, we asked about these previous issues to see what we had done and how we could go about fixing it. They were unable to offer any specific examples. Just said there was \u201ca lot\u201d they had kept in for years. No specific incidents or behaviors they could point to and say \u201cthis bother us\u201d or \u201cthis upset us\u201d. So we were still just as lost as ever as to why this seemingly happy family dynamic was now trash.\n\nThen the bomb was finally dropped and we were educated about the \u201cissues\u201d. Their main issue seems to be my race. I am white, my husband is black. His family apparently have a problem with this and with me because of this. I was floored. Out of all the issues I imagined, this was never one. Of course it was always a fear of mine, that I wouldn\u2019t be accepted into the family, I just never thought it would actually be true. I thought it was always my insecurity. It wasn\u2019t. Luckily, my husband is as amazing as I said in my original post. He defended me and us 100%. He has went LC and I have went NC. He also forbid them from trying to contact me after the things they said.\n\nSo that\u2019s it. No happy reunion or warm fuzzy feelings in this update. But at least we know the truth now and can proceed with the new knowledge. My husband, myself, and our kids will still have a wonderful Christmas. Thank you to everyone who read and commented on the first post.

I am so sorry that you and your family have to go through this. I hope you will still be able to have a wonderful Christmas with your husband and kids. Hope he's doing OK too.", "NTA-I went back and saw the original post.  Their issue is their issue so please do not let that impact you and your husband.  Some ppl have issues with race and will nit pick anything and twist anything to support their narrative. In this case the \"had issues for a long time\" bs.  I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and that you maintain whatever lc/nc that helps you to have peace and sanity.", "I'm sorry you learned such a disgusting truth about your in-laws.\n\nI wish you and your family a very merry Christmas!", "That is not the update I was hoping for you. May you and your family have a wonderful Christmas Day with plenty of your favorite traditions and lots of love.", "Wow- that took a turn!  Well, it is actually better now that you know.  You have a great holiday with the hubs and kids!", "Ahhh\u2026 so good ole fashioned racism", "Original Post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjqgx6/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_inlaws\\_for\\_christmas\\_morning/", "Yikes on bikes.\n\nSo their 'a lot' they 'kept in' for years was racist things they didn't say to your face for your grave offense of being white I guess??? and 'too far' was you asking to you know, spend time with your kids alone for an hour or two on Christmas???\n\nYeah, not people I would want around my kids, especially if your kids are bio kids so are mixed. Wouldn't want them to hate themselves by picking up on this type of judgement and hatred.\n\nAt least you have a truly amazing husband with a titanium spine. Only member of that family you really need.", "How sad we live in a world where something which should be as irrelevant as race is still such an issue to some people. Thankfully you have a great husband. Best of luck to your family.", "NTA - Normally when I think of racism, I think of it going the other way, in which your family does not accept him as black, but I guess it goes both ways.", "[deleted]", "Hmmm\u2026there\u2019s \u201ca lot\u201d of context missing between this post and the last. So your husband and his family has multiple conversations and they didn\u2019t give one example? They just said it\u2019s because you\u2019re white? Suspicious.", "I can tell you from personal experience it goes both ways.  To be honest any person can be racist/bigoted against any group (or perceived group.)", "I don't think that would have mattered in the original post if OP had said that or not.  I think putting it in this post helped up better understand how things unfolded, but it wasn't necessary in the first post.", "Agree wasn't needed in the original post as the sibling had issues with OP\"s tradition.", "Exactly!  It was an unnecessary detail until the update.", "I'm glad you two investigated deeper to try and get an answer the situation and found out the root issue. I am glad you and your husband have drawn boundaries to protect yourselves and your children from them", "No big loss. Out of sight out of mind. You never have to worry about what they think ever again. Enjoy the rest of your holidays!", "I\u2019m so sorry but at least you got your wonderful husband from them. I hope you and yours have a wonderful day tomorrow.", "I wish you and your family a very merry Christmas in spite of this.", "Yikes that\u2019s disgusting. They\u2019re gross.", "Thank you for your comment. He\u2019s definitely struggled. This has been very hard on him as he never expected this from his family. He\u2019s been very hurt and some days are still tough. But we are getting through it together and have enjoyed our holidays thus far. And plan to have an amazing Christmas just us tomorrow!", "Thank you! Peace and sanity is our main priority right now.", ">Yikes on bikes.\n\nI'm laughing more than I should about it.", "Yep. To their credit, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard holding in racism for over a decade so props to them for choking down their nastiness for the first 15 years lol. \n\nAnd yes, we have two bio daughters. I will definitely be in protect mode anytime we have to see them in the future. \n\nAnd that last paragraph nailed it!! I picked the best of the bunch and he has been amazing. He has also stated when we do have to see them again (weddings, funerals, reunions) he will also be in protect mode, for me and the kids. I wouldn\u2019t trade my husband for anything!", "I think the family was beating around the bush when they couldnt give the \"alot\" of things they didnt like. So the family had to finally come out and say it. There are many families that believe you should only marry your own race, some demand that. Some demand pre arranged marriages. I dont think it's suspicious at all.", "Not suspicious at all. I am mixed race. 1/2 Black 1/2 Latina. I see this all the time. My dad\u2019s side of the family (black) were this way with my Latina mom. \nMy dad wasn\u2019t as strong as OP\u2019s husband and it eventually was part of what drove my parents apart.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this was the result OP. I am happy your husband is so supportive\u2764\ufe0f", "Well sort of.  This is definitely exclusionary behaviour but it isn't racism as racism requires power.  OP has power and privilege over her in laws so even though they are excluding her, it isn't racism.  But a response to racism.\n\nEdit: lol, a bunch of r/fragilewhiteredditor going on here.", "You nailed it. There were multiple conversations with multiple family members where we tried  investigating to learn more about what we had done to upset the family. Every single member was only able to give vague answers such as \u201cit\u2019s just been a lot\u201d. We even had one sister say \u201cI understand y\u2019all want answers but we don\u2019t have any examples\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until the last conversation where the race issue was finally admitted and from there, everything spiraled into the dumpster fire it became.", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffethis", "No, it is racism. Racism can even exist within a single race. \"Not (insert color) enough\" This power dynamic is a new element, but it is not required. Otherwise, each case has to be geographic and historical specific.", " it's still racism. Can't preach what you don't practice. Yes, there's systematic racism that affects millions of minority, but you still have to be the bigger person and do what you ask others to do. Not judge ones being on their skin color.", "it absolutely is racism. not systemic racism but interpersonal racism. u r twisting the definition of racism bc it makes u uncomfortable to face the reality that sometimes black ppl can be racist against a white person on a personal level.", "I just don\u2019t believe you. I can\u2019t explain it but my gut is screaming that you\u2019re lying.", "I mean, you are wrong.  Plenty of studies agree that racism = prejudice + power.  Black people don't have institutional power over white people so this isn't racism.  This is just prejudice.", "Nah people of colour have been preached to enough by people like you who wants to negate their experience and get into the victim complex game.  White people have never experienced racism.  You can disagree, but then you are directly going against science.", "They can be prejudiced.  Simple as that.  If you cannot understand the difference between prejudice and racism then I cannot help you.", "\"studies have confirmed this new made up definition of the word\" LOL there is a difference between institutional/systemic racism and racism. No matter how many times you repeat the lie, doesn't change the original definition of the word", "Discriminating against someone based on race in any context sounds pretty racist to me.", "Agree.  This is racism.  Plain and simple.  Systemic racism is a different animal.  And within a family dynamic in-laws have Plenty of power.", "Ah yes because words have literally never changed definition in the history of our world.\nWe have a word for what is going on here.  Prejudice.  Prejudice and Racism isn't the same thing.\nJust because you want to be a fragile white redditor that think he can be a victim of racism doesn't make you correct.  Science disagrees with you, cope.", "Nah, it is prejudice.  Racism requires power.  Something that is lacking here from OP being white.  Her in laws are excluding her because THEY have experienced racism from white people and they defensively a prejudiced against OP for that reason.  They aren't racist, they are responding to racism woth prejudice.  But as people of colour they are by definition not racist.", "Your opinion is not science. And more like you have this weird need to gatekeep a word bc you are fragile. Next we will be saying only certain people can called \"murderer.\" Newsflash, it doesn't matter what word you use, it doesn't change their actions. Im going to keep calling it what it is, and you can try to change the word all you want, doesn't make it so. Cope.", "[k](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384822/)"]}
