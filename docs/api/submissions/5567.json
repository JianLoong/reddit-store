I\u2019ll try to summarize and keep it as short and relevant as possible.\n\nThings really blew up after my post. There were multiple conversations between my husband and both his sisters and their mother. It did not go well. They basically told us they have had issues for years and this Christmas request was their final straw. We were shocked. We had no idea there were any previous issues or bad feelings from anyone. We just had a wonderful family wedding for one of his sisters in spring of this year and we all had a good time together. So to say my husband and I were shocked is an understatement.\n\nOf course, we asked about these previous issues to see what we had done and how we could go about fixing it. They were unable to offer any specific examples. Just said there was \u201ca lot\u201d they had kept in for years. No specific incidents or behaviors they could point to and say \u201cthis bother us\u201d or \u201cthis upset us\u201d. So we were still just as lost as ever as to why this seemingly happy family dynamic was now trash.\n\nThen the bomb was finally dropped and we were educated about the \u201cissues\u201d. Their main issue seems to be my race. I am white, my husband is black. His family apparently have a problem with this and with me because of this. I was floored. Out of all the issues I imagined, this was never one. Of course it was always a fear of mine, that I wouldn\u2019t be accepted into the family, I just never thought it would actually be true. I thought it was always my insecurity. It wasn\u2019t. Luckily, my husband is as amazing as I said in my original post. He defended me and us 100%. He has went LC and I have went NC. He also forbid them from trying to contact me after the things they said.\n\nSo that\u2019s it. No happy reunion or warm fuzzy feelings in this update. But at least we know the truth now and can proceed with the new knowledge. My husband, myself, and our kids will still have a wonderful Christmas. Thank you to everyone who read and commented on the first post.

It\u2019s hard. And what you have to do going forward is raise your children to be better individuals.
