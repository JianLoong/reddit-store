I\u2019ll try to summarize and keep it as short and relevant as possible.\n\nThings really blew up after my post. There were multiple conversations between my husband and both his sisters and their mother. It did not go well. They basically told us they have had issues for years and this Christmas request was their final straw. We were shocked. We had no idea there were any previous issues or bad feelings from anyone. We just had a wonderful family wedding for one of his sisters in spring of this year and we all had a good time together. So to say my husband and I were shocked is an understatement.\n\nOf course, we asked about these previous issues to see what we had done and how we could go about fixing it. They were unable to offer any specific examples. Just said there was \u201ca lot\u201d they had kept in for years. No specific incidents or behaviors they could point to and say \u201cthis bother us\u201d or \u201cthis upset us\u201d. So we were still just as lost as ever as to why this seemingly happy family dynamic was now trash.\n\nThen the bomb was finally dropped and we were educated about the \u201cissues\u201d. Their main issue seems to be my race. I am white, my husband is black. His family apparently have a problem with this and with me because of this. I was floored. Out of all the issues I imagined, this was never one. Of course it was always a fear of mine, that I wouldn\u2019t be accepted into the family, I just never thought it would actually be true. I thought it was always my insecurity. It wasn\u2019t. Luckily, my husband is as amazing as I said in my original post. He defended me and us 100%. He has went LC and I have went NC. He also forbid them from trying to contact me after the things they said.\n\nSo that\u2019s it. No happy reunion or warm fuzzy feelings in this update. But at least we know the truth now and can proceed with the new knowledge. My husband, myself, and our kids will still have a wonderful Christmas. Thank you to everyone who read and commented on the first post.

Hope he's doing OK too.", "NTA-I went back and saw the original post.  Their issue is their issue so please do not let that impact you and your husband.  Some ppl have issues with race and will nit pick anything and twist anything to support their narrative. In this case the \"had issues for a long time\" bs.  I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and that you maintain whatever lc/nc that helps you to have peace and sanity.", "I'm sorry you learned such a disgusting truth about your in-laws.\n\nI wish you and your family a very merry Christmas!", "That is not the update I was hoping for you. May you and your family have a wonderful Christmas Day with plenty of your favorite traditions and lots of love.", "Wow- that took a turn!  Well, it is actually better now that you know.  You have a great holiday with the hubs and kids!", "Ahhh\u2026 so good ole fashioned racism", "Original Post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjqgx6/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_inlaws\\_for\\_christmas\\_morning/", "Yikes on bikes.\n\nSo their 'a lot' they 'kept in' for years was racist things they didn't say to your face for your grave offense of being white I guess??? and 'too far' was you asking to you know, spend time with your kids alone for an hour or two on Christmas???\n\nYeah, not people I would want around my kids, especially if your kids are bio kids so are mixed. Wouldn't want them to hate themselves by picking up on this type of judgement and hatred.\n\nAt least you have a truly amazing husband with a titanium spine. Only member of that family you really need.", "How sad we live in a world where something which should be as irrelevant as race is still such an issue to some people. Thankfully you have a great husband. Best of luck to your family.", "NTA - Normally when I think of racism, I think of it going the other way, in which your family does not accept him as black, but I guess it goes both ways.", "[deleted]", "Hmmm\u2026there\u2019s \u201ca lot\u201d of context missing between this post and the last.

Suspicious.", "I can tell you from personal experience it goes both ways.  To be honest any person can be racist/bigoted against any group (or perceived group.)", "I don't think that would have mattered in the original post if OP had said that or not.  I think putting it in this post helped up better understand how things unfolded, but it wasn't necessary in the first post.", "Agree wasn't needed in the original post as the sibling had issues with OP\"s tradition.", "Exactly!  It was an unnecessary detail until the update."]}
