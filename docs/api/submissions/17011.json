That's fine and all, but she can't expect me to sit and wait for her at any given moment. I asked her multiple times to give me a date and she refused. Well, I am now on a short vacation and when she called today and I mentioned it, she got upset, and finally admitted she was planning on coming this weekend - she'd bought the plane tickets for her and her family months ago for this date. \n\nI mean... not my problem. I booked the trip spontaneously sure, but it's my life and I had no previous engagements because she refused to give me a date. So her surprise is ruined and she's sulking about it, saying things like how it's so unfair and how much she was looking forward to seeing me. I feel a little bad, and I do have flexible tickets so I could change my return date to a few days earlier but I don't want to.
