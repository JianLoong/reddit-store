Even just a coffee some evening?", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re throwing a party for your friends and their significant others. You\u2019re excluding one significant other based on your view of their relationship, when you seemingly haven\u2019t met the person yet. Unless you have a reason to believe she would be an unsafe person to have around, there\u2019s no legitimate reason to exclude this person. \n\nYour friend wants to introduce you to his partner, this would hardly constitute being unsafe. What do you think she\u2019s going to do..?", "YTA. Unless you have reason to believe that she will be violent or destructive or wildly inappropriate, it's reasonable for him to bring his girlfriend to a party. That's a normal way for you to meet her. Let him bring her.", "So just to be clear....\n\nEveryone is allowed to bring their SO without any conditions?\n\nBut you are ok singling out this one guy?  \n\nINFO", "Completely YTA.\n\nWhat special power do you have to be able to approve of others SOs? That\u2019s ridiculous. You are a bad friend.", "YTA.  Perhaps his relationship is evolving or he was not being honest about his feelings.  Additionally, at a get together with couples, it's hard on some people to come alone.

How do you know what goes on behind closed doors? If your friend seems happy and says they\u2019re dating, then maybe be a grown man and respect that. What harm is it going to do by having her over anyway? Your friend is right. Big AH move.", "YTA based on the information you provided. Unless you have reason to believe this woman is going to cause a scene or act inappropriately then you shouldn\u2019t need to approve of the relationship before allowing your friend to come to the party/bring a date. So what if it doesn\u2019t last? If she sucks y\u2019all can joke about it later.

It's your house and you decide you comes and who doesn't. \n\nBut weather he is dating her or not isn't any of your business.. the way this post is written it seems like you don't want this person to attend just coz she isn't your friends girlfriend as per you yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
