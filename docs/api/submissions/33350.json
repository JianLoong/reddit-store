Sure yeah he is family. But this is not a \"family\" tradition - it's your wife's tradition, it's HER husband and HER children who take part in this. Is your SIL your wife's child? No. Who knows, maybe hes just insecure and hurt that he doesnt feel like hes considered \"family\".

And to be honest, sometimes things like this make me roll my eyes because it is almost like people are making themselves more important or elevating the event via exclusion. Like do you think yo ur wife would have liked knowing that visiting her grave was causing problem in her children\u2019s marriages? But I\u2019m taking you at your word that having your children\u2019s closest family - their spouses - present to put flowers on your wife\u2019s grave would be an imposition and that your kids agree. I suppose that exclusion will apply to any grandchildren as well? \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d take yourself out of the equation. This is between your kids and their spouses. If they don\u2019t find it a comfort to have their wife or husband present while they honor their mom, that\u2019s their choice. If they were in favor of including and you of excluding, I\u2019d have said you should let them do what they need to be comfortable. So I don\u2019t see why you should hav to take the heat for their preference. It\u2019s only re-emphasizing the idea that you three are a unit that excludes their spouses. Which is no good since I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you are trying to do.\n\nNTA", "Do your children want their spouses to come?", "NTA, but it's interesting that people are getting so worked up about a simple act that is meaningful to you.

Their being stroppy over not being included seems just silly and a bit childish. \n\nNTA\n\nHowever, traditions do change. Also what about grandchildren? I can see you wishing to include them in the future.

You should not say \"it's family\" because this is kind of not kind to them, but you're definitively allowed to grieve the damn way you want it and your SIL should be more respectful of his FIL", "We have a similar tradition, where we light a candle on my mom and grandparents grave, on Christmas Eve. But we include everyone, in-laws step children and grandchildren. Do you really think your children will want to exclude their children, when they have them? And are you sure your kids still agree that their spouse should be excluded? They may have changed their minds.

You're kind of holding the holiday hostage from an IL point of view (we'd never be able to visit my relatives instead, etc.).", "Sorry, but this is a hard boundary. It's not about anyone's interpretation of family. It's about the fact that I take my kids to see their mother. Period. It's a healthy, private,  and frankly non- negotiable occurrence. You both can either respect our wishes and be a positive, healthy support system or chose to add manipulation and narcissistic behaviors to your personalities.", "NAH \u2014 you have a right to grieve your late wife in whatever fashion you choose. But I'm leaning toward the notion that perhaps it's time to include your adult children's spouses. \n\nAddressing the \"but it's our private family tradition that doesn't include spouses\": *Every single tradition* from your kids' childhood was originally a family tradition that didn't include spouses. Now the kids are grown and married, so the family traditions have expanded and evolved to include the spouses because they're part of the family now. And those traditions will expand and evolve again when the kids start having kids of their own. It's the way of the world.\n\nAddressing the \"but why would they want to visit the grave of someone they never knew\": You said your wife died when your youngest was born, so really, your youngest never knew her either. Is your youngest excluded from this tradition?\n\nAddressing the \"but they're not part of the nuclear family\": Your son-in-law is now your daughter's nuclear family, and likewise your DIL is now your son's nuclear family. Why create ill will among these family members who will be the parents of your grandchildren? How will you feel if/when they exclude you from their family traditions for no reason except that you're not part of the nuclear family?\n\nAnd finally, I'd bet that your late wife would hate for this tradition to create strife within the family. I'd bet she'd much rather have her kids' spouses visit her grave than see the family split apart on Christmas Eve.

But I would go spend time with her, bring the baby by, help her do things, take her shopping, entertain more awkward fb posts from her etc. When she suddenly passed, my husband was too distraught, so I handled cleaning out her apartment and the funeral arrangements. I didn't really have my chance to grieve in all of that. So I found ways to do so privately while I did my best to support my husband. He maintains a private tradition with his kids where they go visit her on important days.

Because I can go on my own and I can take three younger two as well and make it something special for us. Perhaps open up an opportunity where the in laws can go other times,  maybe with your kids and sometimes with you as well. If they want to go alone, they shouldn't have to feel weird about it.

My family has a similar tradition- my grandparents, two cousins, and great grandparents are all buried close together. My family meets every Christmas Eve to honor them. My uncle puts wreaths and luminaries and an over-the-top display of lights and baubles. We toast the departed and say their names, light a candle for each of them. I've played Taps on my trumpet in years past. We've set off fireworks in big buckets of sand that disappear back into a car when we're ready to leave. It's become, as the kids used to say, a THING.\n\nMy family's attitude has always been the more the merrier, bring significant others, we're spending time together and honoring our people- bring everyone!

But, and this is a big but, if your kids want to bring their significant others, you might want to listen to them or you will likely be continuing this tradition on your own. I really like the hot chocolate with DIL after your visit- can you emphasize that and provide fancy snacks or contribute so that is the THING and is a tradition with your ILs and not just something your DIL does FOR you? \n\nWe used to go to a rich second uncle's for Christmas Eve (after church, after the cemetery) and when we came home, my mom's parents would come with shrimp cocktail and we would open one gift and have fancy appetizers before going to bed. It was the THING even though my grandparents weren't invited to the rich second uncle's.\n\nIt's not totally out of pocket that your ILs are upset to feel left out.

Sunshine and rainbows\n\nTwo years ago was bad but we got back in 30 minutes, she wasn\u2019t screaming at her moms grave for an hour", "According to another response from OP grandkids wouldn\u2019t be included either (should they have any). (Sorry, never could figure it how to link comments). It might be strange to you, but he and his kids like it this way. It\u2019s a \u201cthem\u201d thing. I find it strange that the spouses are making such a big deal out of it. No harm no foul in asking, but turning it into a whole argument is\u2026selfish.", "The kids can take their spouses and any future children at a different time. They aren't banned from ever visiting her grave or ever talking about her! \n\nBut this short moment? Is something that OP *and his kids* all want to keep between them.", "Because there\u2019s 364 days a year to do that, and the whole 24.5 hours of the rest of the day. Grief is private in this way to them.", "Then they can go learn about, and honor her any of the other 364 days when OP is taking his kids for their personal tradition. \n\nThey aren\u2019t banned from the gravesite. Just this short personal moment.", "I already explained why I deleted it, it\u2019s still there. I moved it to the info and it\u2019s also in another spot above it.\n\nIt just got moved", "And you don\u2019t think spouses would be interested in supporting their partners through these intense emotions?", "OP, I lost my dad young and I had a breakdown right before mt wedding when it hit me that he wasn\u2019t going to walk me down the aisle, that we weren\u2019t dancing to the song we had always picked. I cried some very ugly tears and had some very moments, so I understand exactly where you are coming from. I also understand that kind of grief is hard to share with people who aren\u2019t part of it. Who sympathize because they love you, but have no personal connection to that loss.", "If this is even anything other than bait\u2026"]}
