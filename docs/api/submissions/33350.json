My wife passed when my youngest was born. We live in walking distance to where she was buried and every Christmas Eve we will walk to her grave and put a flower on her tomb. It literally takes 20 minutes at most and is something my kids and I hold dear. \n\nWhen my son married we all had a conversation and agreed that we will keep it private tradition. My DIL understood and just chilled at the home when we went on our walk. She started to make hot cocoa for when we get back and now that is a little tradition. The issue is my SIL, my daughter has talked to him and explained that she doesn\u2019t want him during the traditions. \n\nI thought this was the end of it and I was so wrong. I got a call asking me why I am not family to him and that he needs to go to this tradition. I told him he is family but this is a private moment.  He called me a jerk and told everyone I excluding him. Now my DIL is in on it and she wants to go. That they are family so I need to let them go.\n\nI told both of them no and they are pissed. My kids are mad at their partners and I am wondering if the family is a jerk for keeping them out.\n\n\nEdit: I talked to DIL and ask if about he honest opinion about the tradition. She was confused and got a different story. She thought her and SIL were being excluded from the gift exchange/ ski trip. She is fine with the tradition and enjoys the hot cocoa tradition. I asked if she could rope SIL in on it and she said she will try. This was a misunderstanding which also explains the confusion from my son. \n\nMy daughter called me and told me she handled it. She made it very clear she doesn\u2019t want him at the event. I also contacted the rest of my kids and asked their opinion and all of them are okay with still keeping it with just us. My youngest has the strongest opinion on this. \n\nSo I just kinda solved itself, though I haven\u2019t heard my daughter that pissed off in a while.\n\n", "created_utc": 1703000216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m4q0n/aita_for_excluding_my_inlaws_from_an_important/", "score": 3208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seriously, wtf is wrong with them?\n\nNTA", "No... what the hell LOL you're NTA. It is entirely fine that you and your children take twenty minutes to acknowledge your wife's passing/visit her grave.

You get to choose how you want to remember your late wife.\n\nSIL is an asshole. It's absolutely not his place to insist to be included. If your daughter wanted his support, then that would be a conversation that could be had, but that doesn't seem to be what is going on here.

I make sure to participate fully in my husband's family and feel very welcome. I still allow for certain times when my husband just spends time with his parents and siblings. I don't join in on mothers Day, fathers Day, and even certain casual gatherings. Allowing that nuclear family bonding time without my presence is important even though they love the hell out of me. I also spend time doing things with my in-laws without my husband.", "Why in the world would anyone fight for the chance to go visit the grave of someone they don't even know?", "You are NTA and I hate for you that people are getting so wound up over something that takes up less than an hour and that you don't want it to evolve into a total goat rodeo.\n\nHow did your daughter put it to your SIL?

Sure yeah he is family. But this is not a \"family\" tradition - it's your wife's tradition, it's HER husband and HER children who take part in this. Is your SIL your wife's child? No. Who knows, maybe hes just insecure and hurt that he doesnt feel like hes considered \"family\".

I wish his wife (her daughter) had had the balls to tell him to stay home, but she doesn\u2019t have much intestinal fortitude in general. \n\nStick to your guns. This is a lousy hill for them to die on (please pardon the pun).", "NTA.  The tradition started before they even knew your kids and it honors a person that they have never met.

I\u2019m married to someone who lost a parent at a young age as well.

It's ridiculous that you and your kids are dealing with this.  It seems like they're just going to keep at it and make Christmas a living hell.

That way, you still be within eyesight of the assholes, and hopefully, that will appease their FOMO tendencies.", "I think they are interpreting this as being excluded from being \u201creal\u201d family. And to be honest, sometimes things like this make me roll my eyes because it is almost like people are making themselves more important or elevating the event via exclusion. Like do you think yo ur wife would have liked knowing that visiting her grave was causing problem in her children\u2019s marriages? But I\u2019m taking you at your word that having your children\u2019s closest family - their spouses - present to put flowers on your wife\u2019s grave would be an imposition and that your kids agree. I suppose that exclusion will apply to any grandchildren as well? \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d take yourself out of the equation. This is between your kids and their spouses. If they don\u2019t find it a comfort to have their wife or husband present while they honor their mom, that\u2019s their choice. If they were in favor of including and you of excluding, I\u2019d have said you should let them do what they need to be comfortable. So I don\u2019t see why you should hav to take the heat for their preference. It\u2019s only re-emphasizing the idea that you three are a unit that excludes their spouses. Which is no good since I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you are trying to do.\n\nNTA", "Do your children want their spouses to come?", "NTA, but it's interesting that people are getting so worked up about a simple act that is meaningful to you.  It also seems like they could all do this as well in separate groups, if they want.", "I\u2019d ask why they want to go. Their being stroppy over not being included seems just silly and a bit childish. \n\nNTA\n\nHowever, traditions do change. Also what about grandchildren? I can see you wishing to include them in the future. I personally don\u2019t understand why your SiL or BiL would want to visit your wife\u2019s grave, but you may need to reconsider how this (very sweet) moment plays out going forward.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t know your wife, why would this 20 minutes be the hill the want to die on? It\u2019s not \u201cfamily\u201d it is your wife\u2019s children and widowed husband bc it is her grave you\u2019re visiting.", "NTA. You should not say \"it's family\" because this is kind of not kind to them, but you're definitively allowed to grieve the damn way you want it and your SIL should be more respectful of his FIL", "We have a similar tradition, where we light a candle on my mom and grandparents grave, on Christmas Eve. But we include everyone, in-laws step children and grandchildren. Do you really think your children will want to exclude their children, when they have them? And are you sure your kids still agree that their spouse should be excluded? They may have changed their minds. I suspect there has been many conversations with their spouses that end with \u201cI want you there, but we do it this way because of dad.\u201d I\u2019m not saying your the AH, but it sounds like it\u2019s time to expand the tradition to include the people in your kids lives. The ones that matter as much to them as your late wife mattered to you.", "NTA...but i get it is a private moment but part of me thinks that it would be nice to show your wife that the family is growing despite the grieve of her loss and thriving. What happens when children come...would it be nice for the children to go and remember her? What happens when you are no longer there and it is just your children? Will they want their partners and children to go then?\n\nIs there no way you can do it twice? Once for the three of you and one for everyone else?\n\nI just think they'll come a time when no one will visit the grave...if you exclude people from going that will happen spooner and that is sad. \n\nWhat do your children feel? Would they like their spouses to go or not? Are they saying no to be polite to you?", "You're not the asshole but you have family members that are trying their best to prove that they are\n\n\nThis is a private time between you and your kids that's it.\nAn hour out of the day is nothing They need to respect this or move the hell on.", "Anything you do will piss off someone-guaranteed.

Visiting the grave of someone I\u2019ve never met doesn\u2019t sound like a good time. Maybe don\u2019t say family on, or just your kids.

They are being so selfish intruding on this, it\u2019s 30 mins they need to get over themselves NTA", "Nta. Your son-in-law is butthurt that his wife asked him to sit out of a longstanding personal tradition that began way before he was in the picture.", "I don't know. I wouldn't want to have to spend every Christmas Eve with my ILs (or at least with the schedule revolving around them) for a tradition I can't even participate in. You're kind of holding the holiday hostage from an IL point of view (we'd never be able to visit my relatives instead, etc.).", "Sorry, but this is a hard boundary. It's not about anyone's interpretation of family. It's about the fact that I take my kids to see their mother. Period. It's a healthy, private,  and frankly non- negotiable occurrence. You both can either respect our wishes and be a positive, healthy support system or chose to add manipulation and narcissistic behaviors to your personalities.", "NAH \u2014 you have a right to grieve your late wife in whatever fashion you choose. But I'm leaning toward the notion that perhaps it's time to include your adult children's spouses. \n\nAddressing the \"but it's our private family tradition that doesn't include spouses\": *Every single tradition* from your kids' childhood was originally a family tradition that didn't include spouses. Now the kids are grown and married, so the family traditions have expanded and evolved to include the spouses because they're part of the family now. And those traditions will expand and evolve again when the kids start having kids of their own. It's the way of the world.\n\nAddressing the \"but why would they want to visit the grave of someone they never knew\": You said your wife died when your youngest was born, so really, your youngest never knew her either. Is your youngest excluded from this tradition?\n\nAddressing the \"but they're not part of the nuclear family\": Your son-in-law is now your daughter's nuclear family, and likewise your DIL is now your son's nuclear family. Why create ill will among these family members who will be the parents of your grandchildren? How will you feel if/when they exclude you from their family traditions for no reason except that you're not part of the nuclear family?\n\nAnd finally, I'd bet that your late wife would hate for this tradition to create strife within the family. I'd bet she'd much rather have her kids' spouses visit her grave than see the family split apart on Christmas Eve. In fact, I'd bet that she'd be honored that her children-in-law want to participate in this tradition.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He maintains a private tradition with his kids where they go visit her on important days. Neither my daughter, who grew up calling her grandma, my son (who was a toddler when she passed), nor I are invited on those trips.  \n\nI don't understand what the in laws are seeking when they never even knew your wife and she had no bearing on the relationship they hold with your children. Perhaps they feel \"othered\" when they want to be with you to show your wife her legacy. I knew my MIL, so I can certainly understand and sympathize with the feeling of being othered, if that's the case. I don't get to go on those trips too, but that's ok. Why? Because I can go on my own and I can take three younger two as well and make it something special for us. Perhaps open up an opportunity where the in laws can go other times,  maybe with your kids and sometimes with you as well. If they want to go alone, they shouldn't have to feel weird about it.

My family has a similar tradition- my grandparents, two cousins, and great grandparents are all buried close together. My family meets every Christmas Eve to honor them. My uncle puts wreaths and luminaries and an over-the-top display of lights and baubles. We toast the departed and say their names, light a candle for each of them. I've played Taps on my trumpet in years past. We've set off fireworks in big buckets of sand that disappear back into a car when we're ready to leave. It's become, as the kids used to say, a THING.\n\nMy family's attitude has always been the more the merrier, bring significant others, we're spending time together and honoring our people- bring everyone!

I really like the hot chocolate with DIL after your visit- can you emphasize that and provide fancy snacks or contribute so that is the THING and is a tradition with your ILs and not just something your DIL does FOR you? \n\nWe used to go to a rich second uncle's for Christmas Eve (after church, after the cemetery) and when we came home, my mom's parents would come with shrimp cocktail and we would open one gift and have fancy appetizers before going to bed. It was the THING even though my grandparents weren't invited to the rich second uncle's.\n\nIt's not totally out of pocket that your ILs are upset to feel left out.

Because only OP and his kids are a part of it.\n\nThe SiL or DiL coming along would be also end the tradition of the three of them, the only three people who lived through the loss the way they did, sharing a brief time of remembrance alone together.\n\nBut that has no bearing on whether they or other family members can visit the gravesite at literally any other time for generations to come.\n\nThe family can create whatever additional traditions they please. There's just absolutely no reason to end this one for the three people it belongs to.\n\nThe SiL and DiL aren't being *excluded*. They're simply not *included*. That's an important distinction that seems to be getting lost here.", "This sounds like an issue between your children and their spouses.

If the former, it may be worth revisiting the rules of the tradition.  \n\nI'd ask myself if my spouse's memory is being honored properly if it's now bringing some discord to our family.", "I wonder if OP has considered whether he is choosing to hear that message from his kids, while his kids are saying something a little different to their spouses.

Do you agree?\" And the kids both nodded. \n\nIdk, some stuff is not adding up about this story bc it's hard to understand the motivationa.

My family all lives out of state; I'd be upset if my ILs had such a rigid holiday tradition that we either always spent Christmas with them or I always had to travel without my spouse to see my family. \n\nI also REALLY doubt it's actually just 20 minutes. Getting ready for a special moment like this, driving to Mom's house, walking, telling stories about the deceased, walking back, driving home ...that's going to be an hour or so even if everyone lives in the same town. \n\nOP also clarified they don't want future grandkids to join. That's going to cause even more conflict, imo.", "I did not say there was anything wrong with it.\n\nHowever, the post indicates that his children\u2019s spouses feel excluded, and are prepared to die on that hill.

I tell story to my kids (now adults) so that there is a connection and memory with my mom.  \n\nMy mom is not some random person to my children.  That said, I would never keep anyone away from going to a graveside visit - tradition is something that doesn't die out - it is something that continues, so yeah, I know you expect your now grown children to not have feelings of their own about their connection to their mom.

But I love hearing stories about him. I love realizing that the sci fi book I found and was enjoying reading, was actually his. The notes in the margins? That was his handwriting.

It was just I miss you, I wish we had more time.\n\nEmotions are not logical, their is a reason one of the stages of grief is anger. Even if we all accepted her death sometimes one of us with backslide go anger or bargaining. Espiclally after with a major milestone\n\nWelcome to complex emotions of death and greif", "God, it must be awful to be as cynical and full of suspicion and resentment as you are. Why are you arguing with OP over how he and his children grieve? WTF is wrong with you?", "Right? I'm starting to think the kids walk away from this tradition feeling somber, depressed and affecting their spouse at home so for all we know the DIL and SIL are actually advocating for their SO's and want to get to the bottom of this strange behavior.", "Do you really think we are going through all that in one trip. Last year we just had a quick talk about her horrible cooking and we were back. Sunshine and rainbows\n\nTwo years ago was bad but we got back in 30 minutes, she wasn\u2019t screaming at her moms grave for an hour", "According to another response from OP grandkids wouldn\u2019t be included either (should they have any). (Sorry, never could figure it how to link comments). It might be strange to you, but he and his kids like it this way. It\u2019s a \u201cthem\u201d thing.

Grief is private in this way to them.", "Then they can go learn about, and honor her any of the other 364 days when OP is taking his kids for their personal tradition. \n\nThey aren\u2019t banned from the gravesite. Just this short personal moment.", "I already explained why I deleted it, it\u2019s still there. I moved it to the info and it\u2019s also in another spot above it.\n\nIt just got moved", "And you don\u2019t think spouses would be interested in supporting their partners through these intense emotions?", "OP, I lost my dad young and I had a breakdown right before mt wedding when it hit me that he wasn\u2019t going to walk me down the aisle, that we weren\u2019t dancing to the song we had always picked. I cried some very ugly tears and had some very moments, so I understand exactly where you are coming from.

Who sympathize because they love you, but have no personal connection to that loss.", "If this is even anything other than bait\u2026", "NAH\n Because I agree it's okay to have certain things with just your kids.  \n\nYou said you daughter 2 years ago had a hard time.  Do you know if she ever communicated to your SIL that she would have liked him there?  Or maybe because of that hard time he feels a need to be there for her?  I doubt he is doing this to be a jerk.  Also if it was me I could see myself in a place I may want my spouse and (in the future kids) there.\n\nLastly only you can answer but are you sure your kids could be honest and tell you if they wanted spouses there?", "NTA but the phrasing \"family tradition\" isn't helping you here.

Hold on, I'll explain.\n\nWith respect, OP, *you* shouldn't be saying anything to the children-in-law. You are not their partners, and this is not solely your tradition. You're not the one who tells them \"no\".\n\n*Your children decide whether their spouses attend. Full stop.* They decide whether they want their partner to be with them in their time of grief.\n\nHere's the problem: by laying down the law directly, you've made it clear to your children that YOU set the rules with their spouses. Now your kids are gonna say \"no\" to their partners just to please you. You have no way to know what they really prefer any more. \n\nYou've taken your children's grief at the loss of their mother, and you made it all about your own preferences.\n\nThat may not have been your intent, but that's what you did. You had a prime opportunity to let your adult children settle the matter as adults to THEIR satisfaction, but you went in like a bull in a china shop.", "I'm wondering why your adult children don't deal with their spouses on their own.  If they don't want them coming along use their words and tell them that rather than making Dad take care of the issue.  Dad shouldn't be responsible for conveying the kids wishes.  Or is it that Dad doesn't want the in laws and the kids do or truly don't care if spouses go or not??", "Your tradition is beautiful and precious. Absolutely NTA. Your story brought me to tears and I can\u2019t imagine someone wanting to change it", "Shrug. If my wife went to her mother's grave every year to pay her respects I'd want to go to support her. Explicitly not allowing that seems like a dick move to me. The way the in-laws handled this is also shit. \n\nMild ESH. You all need to behave like adults not teenagers\n\nEdit: I get that it's your family tradition but your in-laws married into a relationship where their partners mum is dead, they might not have met her but they definitely have to live with the ramifications of that, being there to support their spouses during an emotional moment is something I feel is important unless they specifically want to be alone during that time, the OP's wishes should come second to their kids IMO", "YTA\n\nTraditions change and expand. Your late wife would likely love that her in-law kids came too and some day her grand babies.\n\nYour kids are grown and have partners who don't want to be excluded from honoring your deceased loved ones.

This annual tradition we have is the only thing that the 3 of us do together to bring us closer to her, and it is a very private moment for us where we feel just for a moment like the family of 4 that my children were robbed of. Please understand that it is not about excluding you or anyone else. It is a way for us to feel closer in a grief that only we can understand and share.\u201d\n\nNTA Perhaps in addition to SIL making cocoa for you when you return, you can add on another aspect of the tradition that includes SIL. Maybe when you get back, drinking cocoa, you could show them pictures of her, and tell some favorite stories as a way for them to get to know more about your late wife. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NAH - I get that you want to keep it private and I understand. Think about your answer to this question: if/when you become a grandparent will you allow your grandchildren to attend? Eventually you will no longer be around and your children will likely continue the tradition. Do you want to see them include their children when they visit both graves(presuming that your plot is with your late wife's)? Your grandkids will have memories of you even if they don't have memories of her.\n\nNow think about your dil/sil. If their spouses and children are going to visit your graves will they still be expected to not participate because they weren't immediate family? \n\nI don't have the answer, but I do know that family and traditions are ever evolving entities. What your dil/sil appear to be feeling is left out of something that is very important to their spouses. I can understand that feeling and I can also understand how you're feeling. It might be time to have a conversation with all parties and talk about it. If you can approach it with respect and care you might get a result where nobody is hurt.", "I don\u2019t get why they are taking this issue to you? Married people should discuss this with their spouse. If your daughter is putting you in the position to say no to her husband so she doesn\u2019t have to, that points to much different issues than the boundary stomping he\u2019s already engaging in.", "Tell your SIL that if he wants to be included in every single thing you will allow it this year, but he is to speak of nothing during the walk - from door to door - that is not a direct memory of your wife.  Then tell your daughter you are leaving it up to her to blast him if he speaks about anything during the walk.  Since he has no direct memories of your wife, he should stay silent the entire time.  It will take the mystery out of it for the SIL and bore him; next year he'll probably stay home.\n\nSeriously, ask your daughter if he demands to be in the bathroom when she showers or uses the toilet, because he sounds like a controlling AH to me.  I was married to one of those \"you can't have any traditions that don't include me\" guys; he changed his tune when I allowed him to make sausage with the rest of the women in the family because it was a \"tradition\" and we were being sexist by excluding him.  Made him put on the long gloves and mix all the ingredients, then stuff the casings.  He made 40 pounds of sausage that day and the following year wanted nothing to do it.  Sometimes giving in once will solve future problems.  NTA", "\u201cThis is between myself, my kids, and their mother. Are you any of those things? That\u2019s why you\u2019re not included.\u201d", "NTA. Suggest that they do their own trip to her grave without you. Just kids and the spouses? Maybe that will help them feel included? Either way I don\u2019t think you have done anything wrong, your kids clearly agree with you and seem to be trying to go to you versus their own spouse and that would make me uncomfortable.", "Obviously you should post a notice in the paper and alert everyone on Facebook so no one feels left out. How rude!\n\n/s NTA", "NTA...when I go to visit my Dad on Christmas my husband does not go with me he never met him. Starting last year he was there only because my Mom passed so going to visit Dad and Mom and my husband knew and loved my Mom so now he can go with me. They never met this woman...BUT we started a similar tradition when my Dad passed...Mom called us the \"core 7\" so on Christmas me, my sister, my brother, my 2 sons and my 2nd husband all met at Dad's grave...nobody that came after went or were invited on that visit it was about us 7 the grief we felt nobody else.", "NTA.  Tell them that you understand their love and concern for you all, but that it's important to you all to continue the tradition as it's always been.  It's your way of remembering your wife together.  It isn't that you're trying to say they're any less important to you as family because they're not.  Or that you don't want to share your grief, because you do.  What you're saying is that this tradition in its current form is as you wish it to remain.  You don't wish to add or take away from it.  You would very much like to share the rest of the day with them afterward and if they would like to add traditions to your own, that would be great.\n\nBasically they're worried about their partners and are feeling excluded.  I'm sure you all get that.  But they need to set aside their feelings of exclusion and focus on what you and your children want.  You are the ones who experienced the loss.  It's your pain that matters here first and foremost.", "It's a special moment for you & your kids.  Anyone else who comes is just being intrusive.  Why do they have to go & make it about them?  It's not about them.  It's about you & your kids & nobody else needs to be involved.   They don't get to decide they want to come.  It literally has nothing to do with them.  I would tell them all to fuck off.  You are not a jerk for keeping them out of it.  It is a tradition with just you & the kids & nobody else is entitled to be there.", "NTA\n\nYour kids need to handle their own partners, but if between you and your children you agree that this is something private you share, that\u2019s the end of the conversation in my view. This isn\u2019t about not being family, this is about you, your late wife, and your kids\u2019 mother. That is acceptable and very understandable to me. I don\u2019t get the entitlement of pushing in on this one thing that the three of you are in alignment about, especially because you aren\u2019t excluding one in-law over another.", "NTA. Yes they are family but they did not know your wife, she is nothing to them but a ghost. I\u2019m surprised they are not more understanding of their spouses needs/desires on this, it shows a selfishness and a self-centeredness in both of them.", "NTA: If they are too stupid and hard headed to understand that\u2019s not your problem.", "They never knew your partner, they don't gain anything out of this that they couldn't get from being the loving embrace on the return home.", "NTA and your son-in-law sounds like a real winner.  Geez.\n\nYour daughter explained to him that this is a private tradition.  He decides not to accept that and now he's calling you and arguing about it and complaining to everyone?  What a jerk.", "Nta. It's important to me that I'm there for my wife if she wants support. I would probably ask her if I could go and see once just the 2 of us. \n\nThat can be later though. I am overbearing and know it, therefore I make an effort to give my wife time with her friends without me.", "They are getting upset that they are not included in a 20 minute tradition to remember a loved one, I am presuming they never met. \n\nNTA and WTF is wrong with them. Even if invited, I would not want to intrude on a private moment.", "NTA. Seems like everyone who this is for agrees it should be kept to just the kids. The spouses needed to understand that some things you just can't be apart of and included in, and need to realize that their presence might disrupt what its trying to accomplish. Even though its been years, ya'll have the right to grieve and remember without an outside audience.", "NTA-Maybe it's time to end it and start going alone and let your children go with their spouses.", "NTA, it's really about what your kids want, not their spouses. I'd respect my husband's decision on something like this either way...and he'd respect mine. \n\nAre you sure that your kids don't feel differently? Like what about when there are grandkids in the picture? It's not about not being family, just about respecting tradition.", "NTA.  But confused about whether you are a widow or widower.", "NAH\nFamilies grow and change. Will your grandchildren be excluded? Or will you open your heart to that being a family moment for your kids families and not just for you? It\u2019s up to you, it sounds like, but it\u2019s clearly excluding people who would love to have met her, would probably enjoy hearing about her and would like to there to support their partners. You aren\u2019t an AH for wanting this not to change, but the more restrictive membership is, the more likely it will fall apart later.", "NTA. You and your kids are mourning someone special to each of you. You aren't really obligated to include people that didn't even know her in your tradition.", "NTA Jesus. They did not know her. They can go with their spouses on a different occasion. How can they make such a tragic event about themselves?", "I am so confused by the edit lol. Did SIL lie to your DIL? Did SIL really think it was the gift exchange you were discussing? When your DIL called and said she wants \u201cin on it,\u201d she said nothing about the \u201cgrave\u201d and didn\u2019t clarify anything?? Sounds like the worst game of telephone", "Good on you! So glad it worked itself out with no more drama. It sound like you have more than two children (adult or otherwise) so this might not be the end of it, just be prepared: as long as you and your offspring are all in agreement their SOs are just going to have to respect that.", "Nta. That's not just some family holiday event. It's an extremely personal, private, vulnerable thing. Please don't ever let anyone make you change how you do this.", "NTA.

The tradition is not about him but he seems to want it to be.", "Wording feels like the issue here.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t family, it\u2019s just that the spouses never met their mother, and you want to keep it as \u201cher\u201d family to go visit her.\n\nNTA, but you probably need to find a better way to phrase why you don\u2019t want them to come to their dead mother\u2019s grave if they adamantly want to come.", "NTA. I guess. I am so confused. What's wrong with the explanation followed by the word, no, you are not included ? If some inlaw doesn't get it, then it's up to your kid to deal with their SO.

I\u2019m a veteran and I have a few grave sites that I visit with specific people exclusively. Other family/SO\u2019s are definitely not included in those visits, so I get it. \n\nIt is something that I had to explain to a girlfriend before, and it was not something I could just say \u201cIt is what it is, get over it.\u201d Because it\u2019s not as cut and dry as \u201cwhy would you want to visit the grave of someone you never met?\u201d. It was a person of great significance in my life that played a huge role in shaping me into the man I am today. Not saying that\u2019s how you phrased it but, I see a lot of that in the comments.\n\nOnce I explained to her what it was we do. That, we have a couple shots, pour a couple shots for the fallen and share some funny, and inappropriate stories, we laugh and we cry. And that the main reason family or SO\u2019s don\u2019t come is because we were all there when they died and they didn\u2019t exactly die \u201cpeacefully\u201d, so it\u2019s a bit personal. And most importantly, even though it\u2019s a tradition that I am a part of, it\u2019s not mine alone to share.  \n\nI also told her I would  be happy to take her to visit their graves on a separate occasion, if that is something she would like. That, I would love to \u201cintroduce\u201d her to the homies so to speak, lol.\n\nLong story long, she understood and it actually opened an opportunity for her to learn more about me and my past, because before she didn\u2019t know how to ask without feeling awkward or inappropriate, because I don\u2019t talk about it all that much. It actually brought us closer together. \n\nShe said her biggest pain point with being excluded, was that it was something that was very significant in my life and very emotional for me, and she felt like there was nothing she could do to help or support me, and that left her feeling pretty useless. \n\nI ain\u2019t got no advice, but I wanted to share my experience with a similar tradition, that is never going to evolve or change over time.", "NTA and it\u2019s so weird that the son in law was so pressed about not being able to walk to the gravesite of a woman he doesn\u2019t know with you guys.

In that moment I was not \u201cmom me\u201d or \u201c spouse me\u201d or even really \u201cadult me\u201d. I was just the me whose dad was dead.. again\u2026still and I just needed that time to be mine. It\u2019s ok, sometimes/occasionally, for people to be selfish. To say \u201cno, this is about me\u201d. Grief is definitely one of those times and grief never really goes away. It changes, but it doesn\u2019t really end."]}
