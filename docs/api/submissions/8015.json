I am 8 months pregnant and have not one time sent my husband to get me anything. On top of that research shows outside of medical conditions like pica, pregnancy cravings are psycosymatic and not real. In that women who are pregnant have cravings not because they need anything but because we have been taught through media and culture that pregnant women have cravings. Mostly research shows craving are actually the result or women who finally feel like they can eat what they want and not be judged or because foods are labeled as not allowed making ppl want them more.\n\nIn studies they have found women in non English speaking countries report far far fewer instances of cravings than women in English speaking countries. \n\nBasically your wife is being ridiculous and if she wants something she should put on her big girl panties and go get it herself.", "NTA.

She can't lift heavy weights but unless the doctor has her on bed rest, she's 100% capable of doing housework. She can wash, dry, and fold laundry, make meals, go to the grocery store, etc. up until she's got labor pains. Is pregnancy tiring and uncomfortable? Yes. Is it debilitating? NO. I was 38 with preclampsia and an immune system that went haywire and guess who still worked 40 hour weeks and did my share of home care?

I was super tired during my first trimester with both of my kids, but I was still working and going to college with my first, and still doing household work and shopping with both pregnancies. She's out of the first trimester and should be getting some energy back. If she insists on a slushee at 12am, she is perfectly capable of getting it herself. I'd make late night runs for cravings (my husband and I would take turns running out), but there were also times that I'd wait a week during my pregnancies before getting something I was craving. It's not going to kill her to wait. She doesn't need it right then and there. Unless she's on bed rest or has a high risk pregnancy, she's being unreasonably lazy and entitled. NTA. You're such an awesome husband. Just try to set some boundaries.", "Neither of you is the asshole here. She's having hormonal , emotional reactions exacerbated by anxiety, and you're doing fine but feel you have to set boundaries. I think running for food once, even twice a day is within reason.
