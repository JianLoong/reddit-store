I respect my partner and the fact that he\u2019s the only one working at the moment.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get off her butt & clean the house. I have 3 children, 3 pregnancies. Not one single time did my husband have to take over the cleaning of our home. I was a SAHM. He was the breadwinner. As far as the wild cravings go, I never had any so I can't speak on that.", "At 8 months pregnant, I packed up our house and 2 year old twins, and along with my husband, moved across the friggin *world* to a foreign country.  At 4 months pregnant, your wife can go get her own damn slushie, *especially* since you're doing everything else. Being pregnant doesn't mean you're an invalid, ffs.  NTA", "This relationship is gonna work out just fine.", "NTA\n\nTime to set a time limit on fetching. Ask her how she would feel if you had an accident on one of these late night fetching trips. She needs to make requests at a reasonable time. Save the late night trips for actual emergencies.", "Definitely NTA!!! This post hurts my head. Your wife is a spoiled brat. I\u2019ve been pregnant twice. I worked full time up until the day my water broke, did all the household chores and all the cooking and shopping. I went camping, hiking, moved an apartment, shoveled snow! Pregnancy isn\u2019t easy but it\u2019s certainly not a reason to act like a princess. She can go get herself a cherry slushy!!!!!!", "NTA at all. I'm sorry but why does being pregnant exclude her from all the household chores? Is she having a medically difficult pregnancy? Because if she isn't, being pregnant isn't a disability and she should be more than capable of doing some things. I also hate pregnant women who act like pregnancy cravings are uncontrollable, like suck it up sometimes you can't get the thing you want? All throughout my last pregnancy I had intense cravings for burger King chilli cheese bites, but we don't have a burger King close enough to deliver and we'd have to drive like 25 to 30 mins to get to our closest one. I never once asked my husband to make the drive because I have some self control?? I'm pregnant again now and if I get a craving and I can't have the thing sure it sucks but I'm not going to die. \n\nJust because she's pregnant, she can still be a normal functioning human being that's capable of hearing the word no \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Your wife is crossing into abusive territory. Using pregnancy to justify the abuse.", "NTA\n\nPregnancy is a perfectly normal bodily function, it doesn't prevent the majority of women from doing anything, other than very heavy lifting. It definitely doesn't prevent most women from doing the usual household chores unless they have serious complications. Your wife is milking her pregnancy for all it's worth.\n\nGod help you all if she ever actually becomes ill.", "NTA. I felt pretty awful the first few months of my pregnancy and my husband definitely picked up the slack with household chores. He often cooked for me because I had no energy or appetite. But never in a million years would I send him out to by me food at midnight. Cravings are real but they don\u2019t make you treat your partner like a servant.", "NTA, has she started in on a \"push present\" yet?", "Been pregnant. Can confirm that cravings are really really hard to ignore, arrive at all times of the day and night, are SPECIFIC and unpredictable. \nAlso that hormones are a bastard for making you unreasonably grumpy at times. I can only liken pregnancy to being on a crazy concoction of drugs. \n\nThat said NTA, you done nothing wrong. But she may be unreasonable over the next few weeks. Not every pregnancy is the same, not every pregnant person is the same, but for me, this phase only occured through the second trimester.\n\nThe only time I have ever fallen out with my life-long best friend was a day when I was around 4-5mths pregnant and too hot/tired/hormonal to be nice in that exact moment. We laugh about it now, and I can freely admit I was completely unreasonable & being a complete bitch that particular day. But at the time it was instant red mist rage. Over nothing really. Hormones be like that. I don't know what else to tell you other than stay firm on your boundaries, she will understand deep down but may not always be rational or come across sounding less demanding about it in the moment.", "NTA. I\u2019m currently pregnant, my second one. Your wife is using her pregnancy as an excuse to not uphold her responsibilities and use you to do everything. I\u2019ve had cravings, and my husband only grabs what I want if he\u2019s already out, or if it\u2019s not an inconvenience. I would never send him out at midnight, especially since I know how important sleep is! \n\nAlso, during my first pregnancy and this one, I was still able to do housework, run errands, etc. I snowblowed my driveway at 9 months, and tonight, at 7 months pregnant, I drove myself to the store to buy what I was craving (items to make a banana split). The only time my husband took over all the responsibilities was when I had HG during the first 2-3 months of my pregnancy and was bedridden. Unless your wife has been told by her doctor that she shouldn\u2019t be moving, she needs to get up and get her own stuff if she wants it that badly.", "I think I heard slurpee/slushies are something you shouldn't consume if pregnant.", "NTA!  She doesn\u2019t work and can\u2019t even get stuff to satisfy her cravings?  She sounds entitled.  I wonder how she is going to handle the baby who will need a lot of attention!!  I am a lazy person who worked FT during two pregnancies and still did chores, too!  Good luck with her!", "NTA. Your wife is an asshole. You guys are a team and starting a family together. Sure she is carrying the baby, and you\u2019re carrying other work loads to try and balance things out a bit. It\u2019s not license to just be a bratty asshole and demand to be catered to in unreasonable ways. It\u2019s toxic as.", "NTA. Nah, she\u2019s taking advantage of you. She\u2019s capable of getting her own food. And unless the doctor says so, she can do chores as well. Tell her to stop using you.", "NTA.    Why can't she do housework?  Is she on bed rest?\n\nHusband was out and I really wanted fries, so drove to McDonald's  drive through in my pajamas .", "There's a difference in being hormonal and moody cause you pregnant and being a asshole. Your wife's simply just a inconsiderate asshole and you need to honestly sit her down and talk to her about this behavior.\n\nAlso your already earning all the money and doing all the chores. She does nothing for the home except grow a baby. Thats a big deal but she absolutely should still show gratitude for all your doing for her. Shes pregant not disabled. She absolutely could take on more and be fine yet you have taken everything on yourself despite that and she doesn't even have the courtesy to be nice and thankful. NTA", "I can\u2019t stand when people use pregnancy as an excuse to emanate entitlement and guilt their loved ones to jump when they say so. Practice a little self-control. Midnight runs when your partner has a full-time job are unacceptable, and every night is just unnecessary. I could see asking once but every night at a late hour is completely ridiculous. \n\nDon\u2019t let your wife manipulate you. She\u2019s acting like a selfish brat. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Tell her to get off her lazy pregnant ass and go get her own fucking slushie.", " NTA. Pregnant woman here - your wife is taking it too far", "Sacrificing her body for you? Did you force her to get pregnant; did you demand she have a baby against her will?\n\nIf she\u2019s accustomed to that kind of manipulation, I can only imagine how the rest of your life\u2019s going to be\u2026", "Absolutely NTA!", "NTA. Had a lot to say about my full term twin pregnancy, my despair that I only had food *aversions* except for salted French fries ... but nope. \n\nOPs wife is gonna be a *bear* of a new mom. And not in the good way", "NTA doctors now recommend that women stay at least as active as they were pre-pregnancy unless there is some super restrictive health condition. I am 36 weeks pregnant and have preeclampsia and I still clean and work a bit around the house. Your wife is being bratty and manipulative.", "NAH, entirely reasonable for you to say no! And as someone who is currently 5 months pregnant and cries over the stupidest stuff ever she is likely overreacting because of the hormones so can\u2019t exactly call her an AH either. \n\nIf she is anything like I have been the last month or so then in 24 hours she will be incredibly embarrassed of her response and apologise.", "Agree here. I\u2019m pregnant now, and have been pregnant before. Not only do I ignore unhealthy cravings, I only ask my husband to grab me something if it\u2019s been days and it\u2019s something moderately convenient for him. For example, last night I could only think about plain, red canned Pringles. I would never normally buy them or want them and didn\u2019t feel like going out anyway. Knew it was a pregnancy thing and had some chips and salsa. On the other hand, I\u2019ve been craving green olives for weeks. Can\u2019t get enough of them. Husband said he was grabbing milk from grocery store and I asked if he could grab a jar for me.", "She can clean the house, too.", "I don't think he's doing everything right at all.  His first mistake was immediately taking over all the chores from someone who was already a SAHW.  Pregnant women aren't invalids.  She is perfectly capable of doing the hour or two of chores a day it takes to keep house for 2 adults.  She is also deliberately pushing to see how high she can get him to jump because of her cravings.  Slushies at midnight every day?  He is NTA for his specific question, but he is definitely being an AH to himself right now.", "I agree OP is NTA. But you can't compare your wife to his. Every woman has a completely different pregnancy experience, just like every woman's period is different. This sort of comparison is what makes it so men don't believe their partners when they struggle with their pregnancies. I'm currently pregnant and mine is going pretty decently, but god knows I wouldn't set up camping gear like your wife, but I also have a decent handle on my cravings. The point is, we're different. There's no 'put it in perspective' by comparing women, when you can't physically feel their pain or experience. Pregnancy is known to have biological variance.", "People go through pregnancies in incredibly different ways. My mother and her sister/my aunt gave birth two weeks apart. My aunt was on bedrest from month 4. My mother completed her elite level slalom coach exam two days before she gave birth. That said, OP doesn\u2019t mention any medical condition so she\u2019s probably milking it for what it\u2019s worth. Completely agree he\u2019s NTA", "When I was in active labor I chased my 3 year old around the wooded trails on our property. I would have preferred not to but he thought it was so fun being chased by mommy.", "I hope OP sees this, it sounds like a lifesaver. \n\nNTA, OP. Sending you out on midnight runs five nights in a row is too much. Unless she\u2019s having issues that require her to limit movement, she can wait until the next day or get it herself.", "I agree with you about the manipulation and lack of consideration, but I am mostly upvoting due to the joy this Slush Puppy info has brought to my life!", "I can't tell if this is a product, or if you're describing ice pops.", "Currently pregnant and now I want a cherry slushy. Damn it OP. \n\nBut seriously, it\u2019s cute once to send your SO out for a craving. It\u2019s unnecessary the other million times.", "Yes! I have four I just bought. Raspberry", "Haha, that would be the cruelest disappointment if I was just talking about ice pops.\n\nBut, no, they're a real thing. Just search \"Icee pouch\" or \"Slush Puppy pouch.\" Both brands have their own official branded version. \n\nI promise, they are a real thing.", "Yeah, ngl, a slushee sounds really perfect right now. Might grab one at some point but still not sending my husband out rn.", "If you want to make it fluffy like the dispenser, instead of letting it warm up then hand knead it, cut the baggy open and use a blender. It'll be much more like the ones from the gas stop.", "This is so funny, because I just had one tonight for the very first time ever. Didn\u2019t know they existed until now. And yes, they do taste like the real thing!\n\nSadly, I feel like the wife would find a way to criticize these. Like she needs a straw or a cup or it HAS to come from the store at midnight type thing lol.", "Genius! I never liked the syrupy bit at the bottom, so this will take care of that too. Thanks so much!", "When I finally bought one to try, it literally hung out in my freezer for like six months. During that time, I must have consumed like two dozen Icees. I really had no faith they'd be good.\n\nAnd I do think she'll probably still complain about *something*. But if he cuts up a couple pouches and dumps them into a cup and just grabs some extra Icee straws from 7-Eleven...Then he's going to quickly realize she's being difficult solely for the sake of being difficult.", "If you like the Cola  ones, you can just freeze the Cola in an ice tray, and do the same thing. I drank a ton of homemade slushies this last summer bc it was too damn hot.", "Thanks for the suggestion! I never thought of it, will have to try it. Amusingly enough, some of the best slushies I've had were just made in my ice cream maker (basically the only thing it's been used for).", "I mean the slushie machines are basically giant ice cream mixers? Or at least use the same churning movement to keep the slurry from freezing solid.", "Yeah, it's really only the flavors that are hard to recreate with the ice cream machine. The texture always comes out great. \n\n...And this all just reminded me that I've seen Icee branded syrups somewhere that were created for some silly home Icee machine that had *terrible* reviews. And why it didn't occur to me sooner that the *obvious* solution to all of my problems is to just use the syrups in my ice cream machine sooner is beyond me, but....\n\n ***THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU***"]}
