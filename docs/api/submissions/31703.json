I like his fianc\u00e9 and have no problems with her, I just don\u2019t really know her that well. \n\nI\u2019m due to give birth to my second child in December. I told my dad that while I wanted him there the day I gave birth, I didn\u2019t want his fianc\u00e9 there, but she was more than welcome to come the day after. He said he understood, but got a little upset and said if she wasn\u2019t invited the day of then he wouldn\u2019t be coming til the next day either. \n\nNow while I get where he\u2019s coming from I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair he gave me an ultimatum seeing as that day wouldn\u2019t be about him and I should be able to have people I\u2019m 100% comfortable with at the hospital while I give birth. \n\nShould I just suck it up and invite her or tell him he can come the next day? He was there for my first time giving birth and it helped to have his hand to hold during contractions, but if he\u2019s going to act like this I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it. So, AITA?\n\nETA: before they were engaged he was fine with her not coming to the hospital.\n\nEdit2: my dad won\u2019t be in the room while I\u2019m actually pushing but with kid1 he was there before and after to hold my hand and tell me everything was gonna be okay.

Just to be sure we\u2019re on the same page going forward, Fianc\u00e9 is a nice person, but she\u2019s not your equal in my life. She is going to be your wife and I am hoping she makes you happy. But she is not a parent figure to me or a grandparent to my children, marriage does not instantly grant her any rights to my family. \n\nSo this will change our relationship if I can\u2019t have my parent present to support me without his future spouse.

You want your dad there to support *you*, not to hang out with his fiance and chat. If he can't see that, then by all means tell him then he's welcome to come the day after, but damn your feelings are hurt that he's not willing to be present just for you.", "NTA, Respect his decision and see him the next day as well. \n\nYou already know during birth you want to be rested and comfortable, you shouldn't have to worry about your dad being upset fiancee isn't there.", "NTA.

I wouldn't want someone who's practically a stranger seeing me at that time and in that state. Its not the time to 'get to know each other' either.\n\nI'd call his bluff personally, tell him the visiting hours and for him to let you know what time he's visiting so you don't have too many people at once.

The focus should be on Mumma and your needs and making sure support is given to get Bubba safety here. Only people you want and need should be involved.

Those who are telling the OP to ban the dad from coming at all if he won't come alone for the birth are in fact the ones calling for an ultimatum. OP is NTA for not wanting a virtual stranger at the birth. But Dad is also NTA for not wanting to come without his fianc\u00e9e. So I vote NAH. Dad can come the following day with his fianc\u00e9e.

Fianc\u00e9e is welcome to be in the waiting room with him during delivery, and she can wait for him while he\u2019s in your room with you.

I felt betrayed and you manipulated me into feeling guilty or bending my comfort during a shitty time.  You tried to manipulate me 8n one of my weakest times. We can get past it but forgiving it will be hard.\"", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but such a message is more likely to inflame the situation than actually solve anything.\n\nBest move is to tell the father to come the next day. Call his bluff.\n\nIf he follows thru with it, then meet that energy with the same energy in action and not rhetoric. \n\nOP is absolutely NTA though.", "Honestly I didn't even need to read the rest of the post after reading the heading (but I still did). Ask any delivery nurse...your delivery is your way. Want someone there? Great. Don't want someone there? You got it. No explanations needed. Birth is a super vulnerable moment. If someone can't respect how you want it, even if that person is a parent, then ok, don't come. \n\nI love how this person proposed the message. Gently asserting boundaries in a loving way. \n\nI'm sorry this is even something you need to think through right now.", "This message is very guit trippy and manipulative. It's not something I'd be comfortable sending. The commenter is correct. This hers is a petty position. Tell your father honestly and directly. That you want him there to hold your  hand, but that you aren't comfortable enough yet with his fiancee to have her present, although you have no dislike for her. Maybe liken her to someone who you both know but aren't close to so he understands. Tell him otherwise you'd like the two of them to come the day after the birth. No manipulation. No guilt trip.", "That\u2019s a super passive aggressive message.", "This is the perfect message! And honestly, agreed. If he isn't there the day of like you need him to be and he was fine with being before, \"I'm sorry, we aren't taking any visitors for a couple of weeks while our growing family settles in\"...if your daughter is no longer your priority, then you should be treated like you are not even close to a priority for your daughter.", "It's not just the actual birth itself that's vulnerable and private. Even once the baby arrives, emotions are running high, you're probably sleep deprived, you're a sweaty mess, you've just endured hours of pain, your legs are shaking and it's hard to walk on your own, you're still bleeding and there's lemon-sized clots coming out of your genitals... and that's if the birth went perfectly fine and you're recovering well. I wouldn't want anyone around me until I'd had a day to pull myself together, either.", "Agreed. This is what I was thinking. Is she wanting dad in the room while she pushes the kid out or just to visit her in the hospital? \n\nHonestly I am thinking NAH as I see both sides. That is dad\u2019s partner and they should be treated as a couple. While I wouldn\u2019t want my SM seeing me in active labor I wouldn\u2019t invite my dad without her. I also would never want my dad to be in the delivery room but I am a private person.", "No, dad IS an AH for wanting his fiance there during his daughter giving childbirth. I get that the dad is in a relationship, but he\u2019s still able to have a separate relationship with his own daughter. His fiance doesn\u2019t need to accompany him 100% of the time. Even though the daughter is grown, she should still be prioritized over his fiance. He\u2019s been a source of support for his daughter since the day she was born, and all of a sudden he\u2019s engaged and he can\u2019t be there for his daughter in a time of need? Screw that.", "The problem is OP was expecting him to be in the delivery room for support and doesn\u2019t want someone in there that she barely knows. Dad is giving an ultimatum, too. Unless his fianc\u00e9 gets to be there, he will not be there to support his daughter as he was for her first baby. \n\n\nTbh, I can\u2019t imagine having my father in the room with me while giving birth. Or my mother. Or anyone other than my husband and medical staff.  When did birth become a spectator sport?", "Dad said he\u2019d be there for emotional support, and is now reneging on that promise because he\u2019s mad that OP doesn\u2019t want him to bring a +1 to her childbirth.", "Prostate", "Betting there is no husband in the picture, because in AITA-world you just get pregnant by whoever and there\u2019s no such thing as a serious relationship or marriage.", "It\u2019s not a party. It\u2019s childbirth. Partners aren\u2019t given invitations to the delivery room. If OP wanted her mom there, she definitely would not invite her mom\u2019s husband or boyfriend to join. \n\nSo weird to even think a partner should be invited to accompany a support person to a birth. lol", "It was obnoxious for him to say he wouldnt come the next day.  But OP should stand her ground, or the Dad/Stepother combo will never back down.", "That was 100% an ultimatum, and who chooses a fiance over thwir child, you are a moron", "You are obviously a manipulative person", "Where in this post does it talk about dad or fianc\u00e9e being in the delivery room during the birth?", "It\u2019s ridiculous and narcissistic for anyone to get offended by this", "Whatever you decide, keep in mind that you (or really your Dad and Stepmother) are setting a precedent for the future. If they are a \"both or none\" package, at least you know it early and can decide which events you really want them both to be there for.", "This is good , I'd send a version of this OP", "> inflame the situation than actually solve anything.\n\nThe situation was inflamed when daddy dearest decided getting his wife front row tickets to a birth was more important than supporting his daughter.\n\nOP just wanted her dad there to hold her hand, but he has decided his future wifey being there was more important.\n\nFrankly if I was OP I would rescind all invitations to the hospital for both and just concentrate having people around me who actually support me and care. Daddy and future wifey can see the child later down the road. \n\nFrom the edit it sounds like the dad and the fianc\u00e9 are going to be the type of couple that can't do anything without the other involved too. Like they are being surgically attached instead of married.", "nah, fuck that childish bullshit. be upfront and clear with why you feel the way you do.", "Who cares if it \u201cinflames\u201d the situation. That message is 100% filled with truths. OP should be able to express herself openly, and if it causes a situation she should temporarily cut ties until her dad and his fiance realize they are AH\u2019s and apologize.", "So imstead of confronting the galighter you let thwm qin....", "It doesn't inflate the situation but clarifies it. If people don't want to hear how their actions upset their loved ones, then they shouldn't do hurtful things.", "I agree, and it\u2019s unnecessary to be so confrontational.", "OK, I can see your point too.\n\nThe thing is, the fianc\u00e9 could still provide some serious behind-the-stage-support: Grabbing food and drinks for the dad; providing emotional support to him since having your daughter give birth always comes with the chance that something might happen to her and the baby; being the non-essential person to make a run to OPs home in case she forgets to bring something important into the hospital.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 could do all that, completely without making OP uncomfortable by being around her.", "All of this is true and still doesn\u2019t answer why she can\u2019t wait outside.", "Having just had a baby myself (c-section), I now totally understand why the trend is going toward having zero visitors while in the hospital. The amount of time you spend topless, or sleeping, or topless and sleeping is not conducive to visitors. That first day I had a catheter, people coming to press my uterus, take my vitals, lactation consultants grabbing my breasts, constant skin-to-skin, hobbling to the bathroom in a hospital gown, etc. My husband wanted to let his mom visit the day after. I really didn't want visitors but told him he could have her an hour before visiting hours ended so there was a concrete time we could kick her out. I still wish I hadn't accepted any visitors.", "Actually OP doesn\u2019t want him on the room. She is opposed her her father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e waiting outside in the waiting room with him.", "In AITA world it\u2019s the same babydaddy for both kids, she let him back into her life for another go around.", "Yes, personal attacks instead of arguments... the usual.", "Do you know what gaslighting means? Doesn\u2019t sound like you do", "It\u2019s not letting them win. It\u2019s calling their bluff. Dad is banking on OP wanting him there no matter what, the suggestion they both come the next day likely isn\u2019t genuine. \n\nBut\u2026 I would absolutely be full of it if I was OP when they came round the next day, letting him know what he missed.", "Except OP is uncomfortable with her being there and all those \"helpful\" things you mentioned would likely be done by someone she knows and trusts. Like I don't know, her dad? I don't think OP would be happy with the near stranger marrying her dad going through her home for things. \n\nIf he needs emotional support, fine, but the birth is not about him. If he can't support his daughter without making her feel uncomfortable with his own support person then it just won't work.", "So she\u2019s there to distract dad by pulling him aside for \u201cemotional support.\u201d If dad doesn\u2019t feel like he can be there for his daughter the way he was the last time without needing his own amateur hallway therapy, he should just decline.", "What would she be there for? Delivery room doors aren't entertaining. It's hard enough to have a shit if someone's outside asking if you're going to be long. The birth of this baby has nothing to do with dad's fianc\u00e9e. Dads forgotten his role is to be a supportive father, not an excited grandpa. This isn't about anyone meeting the baby even. It's about providing the best possible environment for a safe birth. Anyone not on board with that is less than needed.", "If she wants to wait in the car in the parking lot, that\u2019s up to her. But OP doesn\u2019t want her on the delivery ward distracting her dad, who is there to support her.", "Right? I'm trying to figure out when anyone in this post was gaslighting anyone. Man, people love to throw around terms they don't understand!"]}
