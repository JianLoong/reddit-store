If I were her, I\u2019d tell sister that she needs to knock it off. Otherwise, her presence will not be tolerated.", "NTA - Do what\u2019s best for your family and sanity.", "Nta. Seems perfectly reasonable. At least you only have one difficult family member. My uncles are tossers.", "NTA - Its reasonable to not want to be about unpleasant people. You should communicate with your wife about your feelings concerning her sister's behavior.", "NTA.  You aren't totally excluding her.  She still gets one day.  It's too bad that SIL isn't getting the feedback that she needs that her behavior is inappropriate.  I would think that your wife should do that because that is her sister.", "NTA - you shouldn't have to spend your Xmas time off catering to someone like that. Do what's best for you and your family and enjoy your vacation.", "NTA. Smart move.", "INFO: Have any of these concerns been brought up to SIL?", "NTA \nMy stepdad\u2019s brother and his family used to visit at Christmas time. At first we liked it. But quickly realized it was no picnic. Suddenly there was a new set of house rules to follow. Even my dad would Fred his brother visiting. So we started to travel. Like a 2-4 hour car ride. He never got it and would follow us. Run for the plane and enjoy your holiday.", "Well, have you discussed this with your WIFE, whose sister it is?", "NTA- Sounds good to me. However, and I may be more confrontational than some, you'll work yourself to death trying to passively avoid this situation forever. You should definitely plan to address her behavior directly when she visits and being that it's your wife's sister- she should take the lead on this.\n\nSomething like- hey, sis, we definitely want to be able to host you but if you're going to stay with us, you're going to have to adapt to the way our house runs. If our household is too noisy or dynamic for you, then you may not want to stay overnight. Also, we don't have any servants here so everyone needs to be able to fend for themselves and clean up after.", "NTA but eh this is quite a petty way of dealing with it rather than telling her to act like a normal person. Are you going to book a holiday every year? You'll need to confront her sooner or later", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re limiting your contact with an annoying relative\u2026she still gets to be there for the holidays just less time than usual!", "I took a glance at your post history - this is just a reflection of a lot of much bigger issues between you and your wife.\n\nYou're going to have to be honest with yourself about whether you even want to be in this marriage - is it good for you? Is it good for your kids to see this example?\n\nI'm not going to pretend I know all the ins and outs of your life from just this tiny slice of it, so I'm not going to pass a judgment here or tell you what to do, but if you keep going down the path you're on you're going to build up a whole lot of resentment for a whole lot of things, and that means a life of misery. You either need to get right with it in your head or you need to find a new path.", "Dude, you are a hero. Sister in law sounds like a major AH. Have a Merry Christmas with your wife and kids.", "Info needed: is anyone accusing you of being TA?", "NTA, but why do you let her take over your house when she visits? You and your wife need to set boundaries with her if you want to continue the relationship.", "NTA. Feel free to leave and create new family traditions. There is no reason to subject yourself to an unpleasant houseguest. Just let her know on time so she can make alternate plans if she\u2019s expecting to be at yours for the duration.", "Considering your other comments, gonna say ESH.\n\nYou acknowledge its petty and intended to limit the sister's time, who also sounds entitled and rude.\n\nBigger issue is working this out with your WIFE. It's her sister and also her home as well. There's obviously going to be resentment arbitrarily making vacation decisions without her input.\n\nIt also just kicks the entire mess down to next year. Nothing got solved by this, it requires actual communication.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Christmas is a time for families to come together and spend time with each other, and it is not fair to exclude a family member just because they may be difficult to deal with. Instead of making plans to exclude your sister-in-law, you should try to find ways to compromise and make the holiday enjoyable for everyone. This may involve setting clear boundaries and expectations for her visit, and finding ways to include her in your family's activities. Excluding her will only cause hurt and resentment, and it is not the right way to handle the situation.", "I have once or twice and been on the receiving end of some pretty harsh words", "Yes and it hasn\u2019t gone well for me in the past", "It\u2019s actually my plan to book something every year from here on!", "Oh.
