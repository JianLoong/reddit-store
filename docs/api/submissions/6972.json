That was uncalled for and unproductive. However, you didn't seem to have done it to hurt him, you did it to stand up for your cousin. For that I'll stick to NTA instead of E S H.\n\nHowever, next time try to be productive in your criticisms and instead of attacking someone's character, maybe offer them help to do better in the future.

I said exaggerating. And if you don\u2019t think that a 16-year-old girl who two years ago was the center of her father\u2019s world and now has to share him with a stepmother and stepsisters might be prone to exaggerating about them getting \u201call the attention\u201c I don\u2019t know what to tell you, only someone unfamiliar with human behavior would take that stance. Of course she feels that way. She\u2019s no longer the center of his universe. That doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s an awful parent. And 16 is an age where it\u2019s not unusual for kids to want to have as little to do with their parents as possible. Is it possible she has an attitude? Is it possible she distances herself from the rest of the family? i\u2019d say it\u2019s more than possible. And now her teenage cousin who doesn\u2019t live with them is capable of understanding and assessing the situation and knows the truth about what goes on behind closed doors, she knows how her cousin acts when she isn\u2019t around, is that your position?

Family discord should be stirred up in families that willfully allow children to be neglected/abused. Harmony should not be built on ignoring a child's pain. If a question like, \"What kind of father does this?\" offends you it's because you KNOW the answer is not a good one and YOU'VE made a mistake. That kind of \"insult\" is sometimes needed for people to pull their heads out of their asses and realize that their actions are affecting other people. It's his own self reflection that hurts his feelings, not this teenager's attitude. When something is only offensive if you did something wrong, the only person you really should be mad at is yourself. \n\nI also disagree that it was pointless. Before, everybody was ignoring this child's neglect in the name of \"peace\". Now, there may not be peace but at the very LEAST this child's pain is being acknowledged and she isn't bearing the brunt of his failings alone. That is not pointless, that is the start to any semblance of justice. Discord is necessary when you're staring in the face of accepted cruelty. Keeping peace is pointless if it means allowing suffering.\n\nEdited to add: Forgot my manners! You're welcome and I hope you're not offended by our differing opinions, we're coming from very different viewpoints and it's all just a discussion on this end. :) I feel the need to say these things because people tend to assign me feelings I don't have here and I want to be clear!", ">Forgetting his teenager's current age was a cheap and especially poor target for OP to use, since in fact perfectly decent fathers can indeed misspeak or even temporarily forget their child's actual birth date\n\nIt just sounds like you took OP's comment personally, instead of looking at the spirit of her message.

OP is basically a child to him, there is probably nothing OP can say that would move him. Furthermore, it is not OP's duty to even *try* to do such a thing.

You read into my comments rather than reading the words themselves.\n\nAs for your second point that because someone is a 16-year-old girl we shouldn\u2019t necessarily think that they might exaggerates something, wrong. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m sure she\u2019s exaggerating, I just think it\u2019s possible, and I\u2019ve known enough 16 year old girls that you\u2019re not going to change my mind that this is not true.

I have a large family, came from a large family, and have worked my entire life in healthcare and have met literally tens of thousands of people under all kinds of conditions including extremely high stress. if you don\u2019t think that your average older teenage girl is someone who typically has a lot more \u2018drama\u2019 in their life as opposed to your average 50-year-old male, again I don\u2019t know what to tell you.
