Her dad's behaving like an entitled neglectful crybaby and your mom enables him.", "NTA. Your cousin needs someone to stand up for her - especially as her own father, her closest blood relative is the problem. \n\nThe fact that this behaviour has been ongoing from the ages of 11/12 - 16 is shocking.

For months in advance I think about what I want to get them as presents.  We plan ahead for what to do for their party.  I either get or make them a card.

Second comment was a bit harsh, but I guess he is accusing you of \u2018making up the situation\u2019 because Lily probably told him it\u2019s okay and she wasn\u2019t mad.

You\u2019re a good cousin for supporting her and hopefully your family feels enough shame to start working for her forgiveness", "I don't see anything wrong with what you said.

He's not going to improve, and your mum either has blinders on because it's her brother or knows and just ignores it.", "NTA, good for you for looking out for your cousin. It doesn't seem like any of the adults want to.", "I was leaning E S H but I'm giving an NTA because you seem like a good guy.\n\nYour uncle is a big AH, no questions about it.\n\nYou were right to correct him about the age, but the second part was an attack on his character as a father. That was uncalled for and unproductive. However, you didn't seem to have done it to hurt him, you did it to stand up for your cousin. For that I'll stick to NTA instead of E S H.\n\nHowever, next time try to be productive in your criticisms and instead of attacking someone's character, maybe offer them help to do better in the future.

He needs to get therapy and go to family counseling with his daughter to repair their relationship.    Being thrust into a single parent situation like that is hard, and he obviously didn't handle it well.   \n\nI'd go so far as to say that the circumstances of the mothers passing may also have played a part in setting this up.  If there was a long illness leading up to it, then the father may have been neglecting her while trying to deal with his wife's health.   If it was a sudden death, then shock may be a factor.\n\nWhile you weren't wrong to call him out on it, you might need to remind yourself that he hasn't had it easy, either.", "NTA.

Personally I don't care in most situations and I don't care about being \"perfect\". Everyone makes mistakes but some of them are worse than other. \n\n>Do you think it made him a better father?\n\nIt will be only his decision how he will process that.

There was a very amusing conversation I recall to this day, where an insurance agent asked him for my birthday and he forgot, while I was sitting next to him in the car. It doesn't change the fact that to me he is the best dad ever, as he proven over and over in other things.\nI have a hunch you are too, considering the fact that you still remember that incident. OP's uncle on the other hand is anything but.", "Did lily told you about what they were talking about? What did your uncle say to her?
