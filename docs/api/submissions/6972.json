That was uncalled for and unproductive. However, you didn't seem to have done it to hurt him, you did it to stand up for your cousin. For that I'll stick to NTA instead of E S H.\n\nHowever, next time try to be productive in your criticisms and instead of attacking someone's character, maybe offer them help to do better in the future.

Tell her what you've told us. Whether she accepts what you're saying is another thing. She may be stuck on \"you disrespected the adult!\"\n\nSo you can tell your mother this: If that adult is ignoring HIS OWN CHILD in deference to his new wife's kids, then he's a jerk.

It's very nice of you to care for and want more for your cousin, however, you need to be respectful and handle yourself in a way that reflects how you would like others to act.  Calling someone out in front of others just embarressed your uncle and made you look like an @$$hole.
