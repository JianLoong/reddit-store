If my fiance says \"the dress code is swim suits\", idgaf if old gammy feels disgusted with showing skin, this is mine and my soon-to-be-wife's day.

Also be aware, while probably 100% legitimate, most \"carnivores\" see throwing up as a reaction to something as very very dramatic, unless biologically necessary like poison.

Lastly, maybe I'm dumb, but how are they not going to question the lack of compromise with vegan meat options like BEYOND(tm) burgers or etc..\n\n\nEdit* while I'm sure you listed only a few of the options, one of the main arguments they'll use also is nutrition. It's one night so they can shut up, but none of those dishes have enough protein or amino acids to be balanced.

(Even those who love meat will at most talk among themself about how there is no meat, no one complains to bride or groom as it is their day and it would be rude)\n\nalso, Is meat the main part of meals there? like every single meal? (Even then I don't think it is worth skipping your kids wedding)", "My husband is pretty much vegan himself tbh. We cook together often and it\u2019s easier to just cook vegan. He likes it. He really only eats meat when we\u2019re out and about and what he eats and what I eat are different like restaurants (except not anymore bc meat makes me sick so we don\u2019t go out lol)", "Plus I am considering serving fish so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s not something they\u2019d eat. He\u2019s just pigheaded. I think eventually he\u2019ll stop his tantrum.", "I definitely have cleared any dietary restrictions or allergies. But yes, I can genuinely smell chicken in dishes. My nose is EXTREMELY sensitive.", "Also vegetables and fruits and curries", "The guests don\u2019t have to eat all of them??", "It's one wedding day.", "All the pasta dishes will have impossible meat alternatives in them, with the option to take them out except the lasagna lol.", ">. I think refusing to serve meat at the wedding puts a big downer on the occasion and can come off as alienating--in the same way that it's alienating when no vegetarian dishes are served. I think it can even come off as judgmental.\n\n Seriously? You think meat eaters will feel alienated when they're served a mushroom or spaghetti without meat? If you feel judged because a vegetarian served a veggie meal you've got bigger issues to deal with.", "She is going to throw up if she smells meat. I think that'd be a bigger downer then no meat. FFS", "How is there an exception for grandmother. Eggs aren\u2019t meat. It\u2019s not a vegan wedding, as OP clearly explained. Nobody spoke about any diet. It\u2019s just a meat free wedding.", "It\u2019s not the vegan issue. It\u2019s the fact that meat makes me throw up. If it didn\u2019t then we\u2019d have meat. Just bc im a vegan doesn\u2019t mean other people are. There\u2019s cheese on my menu too. I cannot smell any meat at all, like even just a little bit. I will hurl.", "It\u2019s not a weird diet though. It\u2019s just not with meat. There\u2019s plenty of normal options that come meat free. Plenty of people eat cheese lasagna and cheese tortellini and marinara sauce.", "Nothing I\u2019m serving is even weird. Do people not just eat cheese tortellini and marinara? Or potatoes? Some things are just like naturally meat free. I\u2019m not serving anything unusual.", "Just curious, have you never made a meal of grilled cheese and tomato soup? Never had a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast? Or daal? Fettuccine Alfredo? Every single meal you've had your entire life has included meat to the degree that you can't handle eating one vegetarian meal to celebrate a loved ones wedding?", "Don\u2019t eat tofu then babe", "There is plenty of vegan protein as well as natural protein with dishes involving chickpeas, beans, tofu and vegan meat alternatives. I\u2019m also considering serving fish.", "Tell him you\u2019ll have steak, then give him a mushroom steak", "They eat potatoes too right? That's on your menu. He's lying when he says there is nothing he can eat.", "More garlic? All the garlic in all the dishes. It's really important that OP's wedding not have vampires. (And definitely not that I have some major love for garlic.)", ">  So many folks also seem to take it as a personal insult I don't want to try their brisket/chicken/bacon\n\nDid they raise the hog and cure the bacon themselves? Because if not, I really don't see what there is to boast about. Bacon tastes good, but it's not like a super secret family recipe. So of all the silly things to get insulted about, that's the absolute silliest. (Like, getting insulted that you're not eating the brisket or chicken is also silly, but that takes the cake!)", "> Hormones and people pleasing\n\nAh, well, allow me to give you some advice.\n\nGo to the mirror, and practice this line: \"I'm sorry to hear that. We'll miss you.\"\n\nOnce you've got it down pat, don't say another word to their petty little threats.", "Your menu has a ton of options. If they can\u2019t find something to eat from that list, that a THEM problem. I have sensory issues with food texture so I don\u2019t eat vegetables at all and many other food items too and I thought the menu sounded fantastic! Also, I\u2019ve been to many events where I couldn\u2019t find a single thing to eat and that was my very own problem, not anyone else\u2019s. Meat at every meal is not a requirement to sustain life. Tell your in-laws to suck it. Happy wedding!", "Instead of doing that, try substituting with Beyond meat. The most stringent meat eaters I know can't tell the difference and its still vegan!", "> Honestly I think maybe I\u2019ll see if I can exchange one of the dishes for a seafood one. \n\nThat's very kind, and if they hadn't decided to be totally unreasonable about it I'd suggest it, in fact.\n\nBut in this case I'm not sure it's the precedent you want to set.", "the only thing that matters at your wedding is that you and ur husband are happy!!!", "Hopefully he will. Best wishes to you and your partner.", "The exception is that her grandmother specifically asked for them and OP agreed. I find it very odd that the only meat she is willing to compromise with are ones that vegetarians will occasionally eat. If it was no meat that would include fish and seafood, which OP is open to serving. It rings untrue to me that the smell of meat is that actual issue.", "So vegetarian options (like fish, eggs, cheese, and seafood) don't make you sick but anything beyond that does??? Sorry OP, I don't buy it. It sounds rather convenient that the smell of any meat makes you sick except for ones vegetarians will occasionally eat. You must have such a severe reaction that just going outside makes you vomit since people BBQ outside and most restaurants you pass will smell of cooking meat.", "It is odd you think anyone else cares about your diet, or that they should be vegan for the day just because you are. Once you start pushing goofy crap like that, you lose the right to complain when guests pass on your wedding. Weddings already suck as is without the vegan conversion therapy. \n\nHow you you feel if someone refused to offer a vegan option and expected you to eat a ribeye? My guess is, you wouldn't be too happy about going to their wedding.", "It is not about it being weird; it is about food your guests will enjoy. My culture is meat-heavy, and years ago, a teacher invited us for a dinner where she served meatless pasta and salad. That night, and the next day, all anyone could talk about was how much the food sucked.", "That would have been my own FIL. Adamantly refused to eat any sort of food that wasn't meat, potatoes, and boiled vegetables. Pasta was the invention of the devil. I suspect he thought it all tasted like Chef Boyardee. (For the fortunate souls who have never been inflicted with Chef Boyardee, it's various forms of utterly vile canned pasta in tomato sauce, very popular with little US children.)", "I'm an omnivore, and I think this menu sounds delightful! Seriously, who can't go without red meat for ONE meal?", "There is no such thing as too much garlic.", "I think it's part of a collective obsession with bacon specifically (which is definitely a thing in the U.S.). I wouldn't do pork products even if I ate meat (Jewish) but SO many people think bacon is the best food ever and cannot fathom that I'm good without it.", "I have seen it as part of  a carving station at weddings and other catered events...", "So he can eat a potato, just like how most veggies and vegans get stuck with salads at most meals. Who the fuck cares? It's one meal. I grew up in a hunting family and even they don't need meat and every single meal.", "No one would miss you.", "It\u2019s not an exception. Eggs aren\u2019t meat. She just added something her grandmother likes. It\u2019s not an exception, since there are plenty other non vegan options available. She didn\u2019t say she wants to compromise on meat that vegetarian sometimes eat. Fish and seafood aren\u2019t meats either. This has nothing to do with food being vegan or vegetarian but throwing up on your own wedding because of the smell of meat. It\u2019s very very common that you get very sick over de smell of specific things like specific drinks, food or even your own perfume. I\u2019m addicted to coffee but would literally throw up from its smell during my pregnancy.", "I\u2019m not sure what is difficult to understand? Yes, the smell of meat makes me absolutely puke and no, I can\u2019t go to restaurants unless they are vegan. I am pregnant and have an extremely sensitive stomach. Fish doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m not sure what to say. It\u2019s a different smell. I don\u2019t eat any meat whatsoever and that\u2019s my choice. But I do not want to throw up at my wedding, the one day about me. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t believe me, call me the asshole then.", "You clearly never have been pregnant. Pregnant women get sick over specific food items\u2019 smell all the time. Meat is a common one.", "She\u2019s not pushing anything. She\u2019s just not serving meat.", "Just curious, do you fry bacon or sausage for breakfast every morning? Never had a bowl of oatmeal or cereal? Never had a chickpea or lentil curry for dinner?\n\nYou've never had a tomato soup and grilled cheese, or Kraft dinner?", "My grandparents were similar, but even they would eat \u201cEYEtalian\u201d as my grandfather put it.", "LOL heyyy I still occasionally eat Spaghetti O's with meatballs. Always loved the  meatballs.", "For the Australians in the house, we call this Heinz Cans \ud83d\ude02", "I got sick every time I went outside during the summer I was pregnant so I do understand that. How is fish and seafood not meat? I just don't believe OP. She asked for opinions and I am offering mine. We can respectfully disagree, that's entirely the benefit of different perspectives.", "Its easy to understand, he doesn't believe you. As your \"only certain meats\" sickness sounds far fetched and abnormally convenient.", "LMAO \ud83d\ude02 I have actually and my daughter is an adult now. Specific smells yes, I don't deny that. What rings untrue to me is her willingness to compromise with meats that vegetarians will occasionally eat but nothing else. It's her wedding and she is free to serve whatever she wants. Just be real about the motivation behind it and not use her pregnancy as an excuse to only serve vegan and vegetarian dishes.", "You\u2019re wrong about almost every assumption you just made", "Me too, and then afterwards i remember why i dont eat that stuff anymore. And then will do it again.  Rinse and repeat.  LOL", "Same but not the ones with the meat. It's a nostalgia thing, like Kraft Mac n cheese. It's not good or healthy but it tastes like childhood", "I\u2019m going to be real with you, I didn\u2019t even know what prime rib was until he brought it up. I thought it was like a special type of ribs lol.", "Are you kidding me? Fish and seafood aren\u2019t meat but both things vegetarians don\u2019t eat. Op gets sick of the smell of the first (as many pregnant woman do) but not the latter. I got sick of coffee, not tea or hot chocolate. You can choose not to believe OP but there\u2019s no information in her post to warrant that conclusion. It\u2019s just your stomach feeling because of your personal reasons.", "Alright well, guess im the asshole then idk what to tell you lol", "It only sounds far fetched if you never been pregnant or near anyone pregnant. Getting extremely nauseous when smelling specific drinks or food is the most common thing during pregnancy. It can be coffee, your own perfume, meat, fruits, anything. Change of smell and literally getting sick of that smell is a very known and wel documented side effect of being pregnant.", "When my mother was pregnant she couldn't stand the taste and smell of red meats (so they were banned for the last 5 months of her pregnancy in our house). Chicken was fine and fish also fine. \n\nAfter she had me she went back to eating red meat. \n\nPregnancy nose can do strange things to different people. \n\nIt isn't that farfetched. It happens all of the time to pregnant women.", "You\u2019re not making sense. Fish is not a meat and has a very different smell. Fish is not a meat that vegetarians sometimes eat. Vegetarians don\u2019t eat fish. If they eat fish, they\u2019re not vegetarians. You\u2019re reaching here.", "You never are spaghetti, Mac n cheese, grilled cheese and tomatoes soup, Alfredo, gnocchi all on its own? You for real need meat including for any of those meals?", "What assumptions did I make?", "SOME religions do not see fish and seafood as meat. Strictly speaking, since it is the flesh of an animal, it is meat.", "Not at all. If fish isn't a meat, then how is someone not a vegetarian for eating it??? That makes zero sense.", "Mixing my salad and my pasta (like salad with leaves not pasta salad which is also yummy) was one of the most brilliant things I ever did. Balsamic vinaigrette mixed with tomato sauce and pasta is exquisite", "Even if you try to change the definition of meat because in some cultures, but not Western ones, they do, this couldn\u2019t be more irrelevant. OP isn\u2019t throwing up from the smell of fish and seafood but from the smell of meat. That\u2019s why she\u2019s excluding meat and not fish or seafood. It really shouldn\u2019t be this hard to grasp but I\u2019m done explaining. You just don\u2019t want to understand it. Have a nice day.", "Because vegetarians don\u2019t only not eat meat but any flesh of animals, including meat, fish and seafood.", "Like I said, this is the benefit of differing perspectives. How do Western cultures not consider fish meat? That's a religious perspective not a specifically cultural one.", "And SOME people who identify as vegetarians actually do eat fish occasionally.
