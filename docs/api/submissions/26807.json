I see absolutely no issue with it and I'm a carnivore.

Tell a bridesmaid to get you a plate please, because you don't want to smell the meat. As long as your head table isn't sitting a few feet away from the carving station at the end of the buffet, I really don't see the big deal having a meat option available.

It's YOUR day, they can shove off. Doesn't even matter if you would puke at the smell of meat or not, you shouldn't have to justify or explain your decision. At least not in my opinion. If my fiance says \"the dress code is swim suits\", idgaf if old gammy feels disgusted with showing skin, this is mine and my soon-to-be-wife's day.

If the bride and groom don't want meat, so be it.  It is not a big deal eating whatever is put before me. \n\nWhen I was pregnant,  I couldn't smell or eat barbecued food without getting ill.

Also be aware, while probably 100% legitimate, most \"carnivores\" see throwing up as a reaction to something as very very dramatic, unless biologically necessary like poison. I'm not saying it makes sense, just saying. Lastly, maybe I'm dumb, but how are they not going to question the lack of compromise with vegan meat options like BEYOND(tm) burgers or etc..\n\n\nEdit* while I'm sure you listed only a few of the options, one of the main arguments they'll use also is nutrition. It's one night so they can shut up, but none of those dishes have enough protein or amino acids to be balanced.
