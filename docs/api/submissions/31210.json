You're not asking for it to be banned completely i.e. Grace can still have a cross at her desk and talk about her own experiences etc, you are just requesting that it not be directed at you (is how I understand the post but please correct me if I have misunderstood). If Grace is taking your request as a personal attack that is entirely her problem. Don't let her make it your problem, have you relive trauma or get triggered just to make her feel better.", "NTA\nYou have as much right to request that as Grace has for her \"don't use the Lord's name is vain\" request.\nMaybe sit down with your boss and explain why it can trigger you \nHope you are doing well", "honestly, its not a good idea to constantly avoid triggers; youd lack the ability to deal with said triggers like an adult. its a very, very, common trigger so avoiding it is straight up impossible, to the point where requesting them never to talk about christianity is unreasonable.", "NTA. With your background it is a totally reasonable request. Grace needs to reign it in. Her needs and beliefs are not more important than those of other people. People with religious background often think they are. It is an unfortunate form of entitlement.", "You are respecting grace\u2019s religion, and are within your rights to clarify what your boundaries are regarding her expression of religion/religious beliefs around you - while you both work in your shared workplace. \nGrace\u2019s reaction and hostility show she\u2019s exactly the kind of \u201cchristian\u201d you\u2019re trying to avoid.\nNTA", "I'm a bit confused by your post.

Considering your work is about mental health awareness and sharing your own traumatic experience, Grace isn't exactly exhibiting much compassion for the mental health and trauma of others.\n\nYour request only pertains to her talking with you directly. That's a pretty small thing to ask for anyone, but even moreso given your background. Grace needs to learn how to show others the same grace she expects of them.\n\nYou're obviously incredibly strong for escaping a cult. You're even stronger for being able to share your experience to help others.

Fears need to be overcome in safe and controlled environments, it is not an easy disorder or an easy task.\n\nAs for the Christian girl, I'd say your request might have woken up a persecution complex a lot of Christians tend to have.

She could afford to be less insistent and more empathetic.", "ESH I think that her request is not really reasonable because \"not taking the Lord's name in vain\" is a rule for Christians, not non-Christians.

Grace is exactly the kind of person who thinks her religion is more important than your boundaries.", "NTA. Its like private parts. Grace can have hers, you can have yours, just no swordfighting in the hallways.

And your story is not uncommon that I would suspect others have similar triggers.\n\nGrace is going to have to accept she can't have it both ways - it's either everyone has to be able to acknowledge that everyone else has the freedom to express themselves and learn to walk away if they are trigfered by a specific topic, or everyone has to abide by some (pretty simple, clear cut) rules that allow everyone to work professionally and emotionally safely.", "NTA. Grace shouldn't be talking of her religion in the workplace anyway. tho 'god bless' and 'oh my god' are both phrases that are super common anyways and I feel like either phases shouldnt be banned, i guess if youre having negative emotional reactions to it then it is a fair request tho.", "Nta\n\nBelieving in an invisible space magician requires cult like indoctrination\n\nChristianity has no place in mental health spaces", "NTA but it is neither useful nor healthy to continually avoid topics and situations that stress you out. If you go down that path, you're basically setting yourself up for failure. Have you heard of the concept of ERP or Exposure and Response Prevention?

Everyone deserves to feel supported and respected at work, and it really isn't that difficult not to talk about a specific topic. \n\nIf you had an allergy to nuts for example, nobody would dare take offense to being asked not to bring nuts into the workplace so that it didn't trigger an allergic reaction, so why is this any different? It takes next to no effort at all.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou're showing respect for Grace & her boundaries & you deserve the same consideration back.", "Nta. Religious trauma is seen as a real thing in the mental health world so I\u2019m shocked that she does not know about it. You\u2019re in your right to not want to hear her talk about her religion when she\u2019s aware of your past. As a cult survivor myself it\u2019s taking years of trauma work to get over it but I know that one day I will. For her to go out of her way to nitpick your speech is completely ignorant of what you\u2019re going through and is pushing you back from your end goal. I hope you get through everything stronger and there\u2019s always a better day !", "ESH.  You are both taking things to the extreme.  I get that you have trauma, but your requests are just as ridiculous as Grace\u2019s.  You need to learn to deal with your trauma and still live in a world full of religious people.  I\u2019m an atheist with my own religious trauma, and I\u2019ve had those annoying Christian coworkers that mention God all the time and talk about church or whatever.  Sure it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s part of their identity.  As long as they aren\u2019t preaching at me or trying to get me to join in, there\u2019s no real harm to it.  Getting annoyed at Grace for trying to police people\u2019s speech while doing the same damn thing is downright hypocritical.", "ESH. It is patently inappropriate for Grace to *constantly* discuss her religious beliefs at work or to make *formal, company-wide* requests that others adjust their behavior to \u201crespect\u201d that. I say that as a Christian married to the son of a pastor. It\u2019s all well and good to exist in such a way that people know/assume you believe x thing or to have a small emblem like a cross or star or whatever else at your own desk. It\u2019s even alright to have a personal conversation with someone if they\u2019re making you really uncomfortable. But we are not at work to learn about everyone\u2019s spiritual beliefs. \n\nThe exact same thing applies to you. It\u2019s equally important to you, personally, to avoid displays of Christianity as it is to her to express them. Expecting that she and everyone else at work adjust their behavior to cater to your concerns is not appropriate. It\u2019s not \u201cokay\u201d because of the nature of your experience or because it\u2019s Christianity. How do you think it would go if your trigger was someone saying \u201cAllah\u201d or speaking Chinese so everyone was asked not to do that around you? Would you think someone was being ridiculous for feeling discriminated against by that request? Probably not. \n\nIt sounds like this work environment may not be appropriate for your healing process.", "NTA. Not your problem.", "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a good acronym for this. I\u2019m leaning towards ESH except I don\u2019t think anybody actually sucks. This is just a difficult situation because the same thing means two very different things to both of you. Sometimes things can suck and nobody is really at fault", "NTA. You are protected just as she is.

I'm sure you don't mean to come off this way but for people looking for drama, they're going to jump on you for this.\n\nFact is, you're in a judeo-christian culture, regardless of specific denominational popularity. You're gonna have a bad time if you cannot separate christians from Christianity, and yourself from christians as well.

You cannot make the argument that Catholic church bells ringing have anything to do with whatever you went through.", "NTA.

However, Christianity does place a strong emphasis on proselytizing and trying to convert non-Christians. A fairly substantial percentage of Christians seemingly go against most of Christ's teachings and yet still look down on and criticize anyone who doesn't believe the exact same thing they believe, and that occurs even between Christians of different denominations.

You're still not getting the point. Just because your school or denomination doesn't encourage it doesn't mean that it's not a common practice. It's also funny that you assume I don't know the basics when I was raised in a Christian home and went to religious schools all my life. \n\nGo to most any developing country in the world and you'll find a huge number of Christian missionaries.
