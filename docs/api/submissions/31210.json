You're not asking for it to be banned completely i.e. Grace can still have a cross at her desk and talk about her own experiences etc, you are just requesting that it not be directed at you (is how I understand the post but please correct me if I have misunderstood). If Grace is taking your request as a personal attack that is entirely her problem. Don't let her make it your problem, have you relive trauma or get triggered just to make her feel better.", "NTA\nYou have as much right to request that as Grace has for her \"don't use the Lord's name is vain\" request.\nMaybe sit down with your boss and explain why it can trigger you \nHope you are doing well", "honestly, its not a good idea to constantly avoid triggers; youd lack the ability to deal with said triggers like an adult. its a very, very, common trigger so avoiding it is straight up impossible, to the point where requesting them never to talk about christianity is unreasonable.", "NTA. With your background it is a totally reasonable request. Grace needs to reign it in. Her needs and beliefs are not more important than those of other people. People with religious background often think they are. It is an unfortunate form of entitlement.", "You are respecting grace\u2019s religion, and are within your rights to clarify what your boundaries are regarding her expression of religion/religious beliefs around you - while you both work in your shared workplace. \nGrace\u2019s reaction and hostility show she\u2019s exactly the kind of \u201cchristian\u201d you\u2019re trying to avoid.\nNTA", "I'm a bit confused by your post.

Considering your work is about mental health awareness and sharing your own traumatic experience, Grace isn't exactly exhibiting much compassion for the mental health and trauma of others.\n\nYour request only pertains to her talking with you directly. That's a pretty small thing to ask for anyone, but even moreso given your background. Grace needs to learn how to show others the same grace she expects of them.\n\nYou're obviously incredibly strong for escaping a cult. You're even stronger for being able to share your experience to help others. Don't let Grace be the one to dull your shine with self doubt.", "NTA\n\nI don't quite agree with the takes claiming that you're not facing your problems or being too sensitive, you're only requesting not to be bombarded with topics that trigger your *actual PTSD* when it can be helped. Fears need to be overcome in safe and controlled environments, it is not an easy disorder or an easy task.\n\nAs for the Christian girl, I'd say your request might have woken up a persecution complex a lot of Christians tend to have. She's being selfish, especially if she knows that you used to be in a cult. She could afford to be less insistent and more empathetic.", "ESH I think that her request is not really reasonable because \"not taking the Lord's name in vain\" is a rule for Christians, not non-Christians. She has to work on not doing it herself because she is supposed to have respect for her god. She does not have the right to demand that other's tip-toe around linguistically so that they are showing respect to her god by her religion's standards.\n\nIn your case, I think it would be fine to ask others not to try to engage you in conversation about Christianity, or at least to respect your refusal to do so, but I don't think you should have the right to demand that others not discuss Christianity in your hearing.\n\nIn both cases I think the idea that you should be able to control what other people say in your vicinity based on your personal idiosyncrasies, or the particular standards of the religion/ideology/etc that you belong to is asking for too much.", "NTA", "Nta at all", "NTA", "NTA. Grace is exactly the kind of person who thinks her religion is more important than your boundaries.", "NTA. Its like private parts. Grace can have hers, you can have yours, just no swordfighting in the hallways. It sounds perfectly respectable.", "NTA, Grace sounds exhausting to be around. \n\nJust a blanket rule of \"no religious talk of any kind\" would be best considering it's a mental health organization that I presume is secular-based? And your story is not uncommon that I would suspect others have similar triggers.\n\nGrace is going to have to accept she can't have it both ways - it's either everyone has to be able to acknowledge that everyone else has the freedom to express themselves and learn to walk away if they are trigfered by a specific topic, or everyone has to abide by some (pretty simple, clear cut) rules that allow everyone to work professionally and emotionally safely.", "NTA. Grace shouldn't be talking of her religion in the workplace anyway. tho 'god bless' and 'oh my god' are both phrases that are super common anyways and I feel like either phases shouldnt be banned, i guess if youre having negative emotional reactions to it then it is a fair request tho.", "Nta\n\nBelieving in an invisible space magician requires cult like indoctrination\n\nChristianity has no place in mental health spaces", "NTA but it is neither useful nor healthy to continually avoid topics and situations that stress you out. If you go down that path, you're basically setting yourself up for failure. Have you heard of the concept of ERP or Exposure and Response Prevention? I am of the opinion that it may be an equally valid alternative to avoiding triggers. \n\nThere is no rule that adult life will be kind or empathetic.

I'm sure with time OP will learn to handle certain triggers, but they need to do it in their own time at their own pace. I think it's valid, considering the work OP does, to ask their colleagues to not use their specific triggers towards them until they feel ok around them.", "Because that\u2019s what this sub does? Are you new?", "Agreed. A big reason that I quit the 90% black school I worked at last year was because the principal would constantly lead students in prayer at any assembly and expect staff to join in, and she tried to penalize me for taking a half day so that I could travel to my family for Passover one year, until I got the union involved.  I also experienced some pretty blatant and intentional antisemitic comments from students, and was told to \u201cdon\u2019t take it so personally\u201d.
