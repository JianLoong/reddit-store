Your mother's insomnia is her issue, and it is not your responsibility. You have a right to privacy and honestly, it's creepy to share a bed with your mother at 14 years old. \n\nYour mother needs to consult her doctor about her insomnia and figure out a solution that doesn't involve forcing her children to share her bed. She deserves some empathy. I have insomnia, and it sucks. But I deal with it on my own. I don't force anyone else to suffer because of it.", "NTA\n\nEveryone telling you to be nicer to your mom is off their rocker. Your mom's demand is completely inappropriate and a little creepy. She needs to be told NO in the strongest terms possible. You already tried telling her no and she refused to listen. So you had to escalate. \n\nIs there another trusted adult in your life that you can talk to about this?

Your mother should NOT be forcing you to share a bed. Emergency circumstances causing you to sleep with her are one thing, but these are not emergency circumstances. \n\nAsk your mom and dad this: what would happen if an adult at school learned of her behavior? What if it was reported to CPS? Her abandonment or attachment issues are for her to figure out.", "NTA - it sounds like you\u2019ve attempted to communicate with less vulgar language before, which to me makes the language choice understandable. You have the right to decline sharing a bed with people who you don\u2019t want to share a bed with. If your mom has issues with sleeping alone, that\u2019s something she should work on with a mental health professional.", "NTA, your mum sounds pretty controlling. just because she feels lonely at night by herself is not a reason to force her teenage son to sleep next to her all night, frankly that\u2019s a bit strange. maybe mention it to your dad and see if you can enforce your boundaries around her", "This is the definition of emotional incest. This is not okay. This is abusive behavior. Anyone telling you to tiptoe around her feelings is so far off base. NTA and you are fully within your rights to call the police if your creeptastic mother forces you into her bed tonight against your will. I can\u2019t even believe I have to type that sentence.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like your mom could benefit from therapy.

This is so weird and inappropriate. Is it that she\u2019s scared, or what? If she\u2019s scared, she should get some pepper spray and lock her door (which I have other thoughts, like in the absence of an immediate and credible threat, it\u2019s incredibly childish for her to be scared to sleep alone). If she\u2019s not scared, then there\u2019s nothing even remotely approaching an acceptable excuse for any of this.

Try a small light, a fan on, the tv on (these things help me and I particularly rely on Seinfeld because the picture isn\u2019t as bright and won\u2019t keep me up). Or maybe getting a dog or cat. Dogs are wonderful sleep companions!\n\nIt sounds like maybe psychologically there is an issue that may stem from childhood. Maybe a therapist could help her through it.

If not malicious compliance in this case may get her to listen, don\u2019t shower, use deodorant or brush your teeth that day, toss turn, huff and puff, pretend to snore, get up to use the bathroom a lot. I would ensure that she finds it miserable to share the bed. This is not a good life strategy for conflict but in this case it may necessary. She needs to fix her problem on her own.", "NTA but please ask nicely.. I'm going to assume you were justified because your boundaries were being pushed though.
