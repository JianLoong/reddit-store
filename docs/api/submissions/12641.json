Your mother's insomnia is her issue, and it is not your responsibility. You have a right to privacy and honestly, it's creepy to share a bed with your mother at 14 years old. \n\nYour mother needs to consult her doctor about her insomnia and figure out a solution that doesn't involve forcing her children to share her bed. She deserves some empathy. I have insomnia, and it sucks. But I deal with it on my own. I don't force anyone else to suffer because of it.", "NTA\n\nEveryone telling you to be nicer to your mom is off their rocker. Your mom's demand is completely inappropriate and a little creepy. She needs to be told NO in the strongest terms possible. You already tried telling her no and she refused to listen. So you had to escalate. \n\nIs there another trusted adult in your life that you can talk to about this? I'm worried for you.\n\nFor context, I'm a mom of teenagers and I would NEVER demand that they sleep with me. That would be completely inappropriate.", "The mods are gonna lock this for being about bodily autonomy, so I gotta be fast: tell your dad immediately, and if he does nothing (or if you have and he's done nothing), tell another adult family member you trust or a teacher you trust. The result should be someone stopping this or getting the cops involved. What your mom is doing is WRONG.", "Absolutely, 100% NTA. \n\nAt 14, you\u2019re a young man. Not a child. Your mother should NOT be forcing you to share a bed. Emergency circumstances causing you to sleep with her are one thing, but these are not emergency circumstances. \n\nAsk your mom and dad this: what would happen if an adult at school learned of her behavior? What if it was reported to CPS? Her abandonment or attachment issues are for her to figure out.", "NTA - it sounds like you\u2019ve attempted to communicate with less vulgar language before, which to me makes the language choice understandable. You have the right to decline sharing a bed with people who you don\u2019t want to share a bed with. If your mom has issues with sleeping alone, that\u2019s something she should work on with a mental health professional.", "NTA, your mum sounds pretty controlling. just because she feels lonely at night by herself is not a reason to force her teenage son to sleep next to her all night, frankly that\u2019s a bit strange. maybe mention it to your dad and see if you can enforce your boundaries around her", "This is the definition of emotional incest. This is not okay. This is abusive behavior. Anyone telling you to tiptoe around her feelings is so far off base. NTA and you are fully within your rights to call the police if your creeptastic mother forces you into her bed tonight against your will. I can\u2019t even believe I have to type that sentence.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like your mom could benefit from therapy. Forcing a teenager to sleep with her because she can\u2019t sleep alone is really wrong, especially since you\u2019ve told her you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA.  She is wrong.", "NTA. This is so weird and inappropriate. Is it that she\u2019s scared, or what? If she\u2019s scared, she should get some pepper spray and lock her door (which I have other thoughts, like in the absence of an immediate and credible threat, it\u2019s incredibly childish for her to be scared to sleep alone). If she\u2019s not scared, then there\u2019s nothing even remotely approaching an acceptable excuse for any of this. Regardless, it\u2019s oddly extreme and controlling behavior.", "Maybe she needs a body pillow she can sleep with and hold instead of you or sister.. very odd and creepy. Nta", "NTA. You could have used kinder words, but you have the right to say no. No mom should ask her teenage son to sleep next her, and yes you have the right to privacy.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nIf she has trouble sleeping alone that\u2019s understandable but also an easy fix. Try a small light, a fan on, the tv on (these things help me and I particularly rely on Seinfeld because the picture isn\u2019t as bright and won\u2019t keep me up). Or maybe getting a dog or cat. Dogs are wonderful sleep companions!\n\nIt sounds like maybe psychologically there is an issue that may stem from childhood. Maybe a therapist could help her through it. Regardless you guys are growing up and healthy boundaries need to be established. I wish you good luck in this and I hope your family is able to reach a solution that benefits everyone involved. \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nChildren should not call their parents \u201cfucking idiots,\u201d but this impingement on your autonomy is the greater sin.", "NTA for not wanting to sleep with your mother. I don\u2019t think kids should curse at their parents, but if that\u2019s what it takes to get her to stop that creepy behavior, so be it.", "Nta and since your dad won\u2019t help you then I would just tell her no and stay in your room no matter what. This is VERY inappropriate!  If they both keep insisting I may even say talking to a school counselor if you feel that\u2019s appropriate?", "NTA", "NTA.  Get your mother a teddy bear.", "NTA", "OP are there things you could be doing in your bed that would make it a hostile environment for your mother? NTA", "NTA. Your mom should go to therapy. It would help her greatly.", "NTA\n\nIf you, as a child, want to sleep in the bed with your parent(s) that's totally fine. As a parent, you shouldn't be asking, let alone demanding, your child sleep in your bed with you. This is unhealthy co-dependant behaviour.\n\nI'm sorry you're in this situation, it's really unfair to you.", "NTA her *forcing* you to do this when the rest of the family is away *screams* [emotional incest](https://psychcentral.com/sex/emotional-incest-when-is-close-too-close) to me. Is your dad or any other family or adults aware of this??? Anybody who might advocate for you?", "Norman?! NORMAN?!?!\n\nI get why people are saying you were over the top. However, I think your reaction is justified because this is not ok at all. Would people still think everyone sucks if it was a 14 year old girl with her dad?\n\nEdit* NTA at all", "NTA. While you shouldn't disrespect your parents like others have stated, she has crossed a line that is way more important imo. I'm sorry and I honestly would report her to cps yourself if super uncomfortable with your situation. It's not even if she is doing anything inappropriate but at your age you should have privacy without having to fight for it.", "NTA. I hope someone steps up to look out for you. If not malicious compliance in this case may get her to listen, don\u2019t shower, use deodorant or brush your teeth that day, toss turn, huff and puff, pretend to snore, get up to use the bathroom a lot. I would ensure that she finds it miserable to share the bed. This is not a good life strategy for conflict but in this case it may necessary. She needs to fix her problem on her own.", "NTA but please ask nicely.. I'm going to assume you were justified because your boundaries were being pushed though. Your mom might be going through some things and didn't mean harm, hopefully. Also having early bedtime is kind of ridiculous. But that just might be the rules of the house?\n\nInfo: How is your family's living situation? Do you know why your mother wants to sleep with you specifically? Is there alternate places for you to sleep?", "NTA \n\nYou were rude to a parent and that is never good.   But at 14 co-sleeping should be a mutual choice.  You\u2019ve said no nicely.  Perhaps it would\u2019ve been a better idea to ask your father to talk to her on your behalf first.  Your mother has to accept that you\u2019re old enough to decide that this isn\u2019t for you.", "NTA.  Your mom has issues.  A very unusual and abnormal situation to insist a teenage boy to sleep with his mom.  \n\nWould she let you sleep in her room but on the floor with a sleeping bag?  Even if no then maybe use a sleeping bag on the bed to cut down on the weirdness.", "NTA. you shouldn't be so harsh on her, but you have a choice to not sleep with her. she probably is just scared, so get her a nightlight or something.", "Call for Mr. Bates\u2014Mr. Norman Bates. ESH, just because you lashed out at your mother, but you\u2019re otherwise correct in feeling that your mother is overstepping your personal boundaries.", "Ever consider the possibility that your mom has experienced a trauma in her past and has not confided the details to her kids?\n\nWhatever it is, it sounds like your mom might have some serious issues and she needs -someone- she trusts in the room to help her sleep.\n\nThis is not your problem, however your reaction was extremely hostile and over the top. If she needs help with her issues, she might need someone she trusts to help convince her to get that help, not simply insults that shame her.\n\nESH", "ESH.
