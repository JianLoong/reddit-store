Your mother's insomnia is her issue, and it is not your responsibility. You have a right to privacy and honestly, it's creepy to share a bed with your mother at 14 years old. \n\nYour mother needs to consult her doctor about her insomnia and figure out a solution that doesn't involve forcing her children to share her bed. She deserves some empathy. I have insomnia, and it sucks. But I deal with it on my own. I don't force anyone else to suffer because of it.", "NTA\n\nEveryone telling you to be nicer to your mom is off their rocker. Your mom's demand is completely inappropriate and a little creepy. She needs to be told NO in the strongest terms possible. You already tried telling her no and she refused to listen. So you had to escalate. \n\nIs there another trusted adult in your life that you can talk to about this? I'm worried for you.\n\nFor context, I'm a mom of teenagers and I would NEVER demand that they sleep with me. That would be completely inappropriate.", "The mods are gonna lock this for being about bodily autonomy, so I gotta be fast: tell your dad immediately, and if he does nothing (or if you have and he's done nothing), tell another adult family member you trust or a teacher you trust. The result should be someone stopping this or getting the cops involved. What your mom is doing is WRONG.", "Absolutely, 100% NTA. \n\nAt 14, you\u2019re a young man. Not a child. Your mother should NOT be forcing you to share a bed. Emergency circumstances causing you to sleep with her are one thing, but these are not emergency circumstances. \n\nAsk your mom and dad this: what would happen if an adult at school learned of her behavior? What if it was reported to CPS? Her abandonment or attachment issues are for her to figure out.", "NTA - it sounds like you\u2019ve attempted to communicate with less vulgar language before, which to me makes the language choice understandable. You have the right to decline sharing a bed with people who you don\u2019t want to share a bed with. If your mom has issues with sleeping alone, that\u2019s something she should work on with a mental health professional.", "NTA, your mum sounds pretty controlling. just because she feels lonely at night by herself is not a reason to force her teenage son to sleep next to her all night, frankly that\u2019s a bit strange. maybe mention it to your dad and see if you can enforce your boundaries around her", "This is the definition of emotional incest. This is not okay. This is abusive behavior. Anyone telling you to tiptoe around her feelings is so far off base. NTA and you are fully within your rights to call the police if your creeptastic mother forces you into her bed tonight against your will. I can\u2019t even believe I have to type that sentence.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like your mom could benefit from therapy. Forcing a teenager to sleep with her because she can\u2019t sleep alone is really wrong, especially since you\u2019ve told her you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA.  She is wrong.", "NTA. This is so weird and inappropriate. Is it that she\u2019s scared, or what? If she\u2019s scared, she should get some pepper spray and lock her door (which I have other thoughts, like in the absence of an immediate and credible threat, it\u2019s incredibly childish for her to be scared to sleep alone). If she\u2019s not scared, then there\u2019s nothing even remotely approaching an acceptable excuse for any of this. Regardless, it\u2019s oddly extreme and controlling behavior.", "Maybe she needs a body pillow she can sleep with and hold instead of you or sister.. very odd and creepy. Nta", "NTA. You could have used kinder words, but you have the right to say no. No mom should ask her teenage son to sleep next her, and yes you have the right to privacy.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nIf she has trouble sleeping alone that\u2019s understandable but also an easy fix. Try a small light, a fan on, the tv on (these things help me and I particularly rely on Seinfeld because the picture isn\u2019t as bright and won\u2019t keep me up). Or maybe getting a dog or cat. Dogs are wonderful sleep companions!\n\nIt sounds like maybe psychologically there is an issue that may stem from childhood. Maybe a therapist could help her through it.

While you shouldn't disrespect your parents like others have stated, she has crossed a line that is way more important imo. I'm sorry and I honestly would report her to cps yourself if super uncomfortable with your situation. It's not even if she is doing anything inappropriate but at your age you should have privacy without having to fight for it.", "NTA. I hope someone steps up to look out for you. If not malicious compliance in this case may get her to listen, don\u2019t shower, use deodorant or brush your teeth that day, toss turn, huff and puff, pretend to snore, get up to use the bathroom a lot. I would ensure that she finds it miserable to share the bed. This is not a good life strategy for conflict but in this case it may necessary. She needs to fix her problem on her own.", "NTA but please ask nicely.. I'm going to assume you were justified because your boundaries were being pushed though. Your mom might be going through some things and didn't mean harm, hopefully. Also having early bedtime is kind of ridiculous.

Is there alternate places for you to sleep?", "NTA \n\nYou were rude to a parent and that is never good.   But at 14 co-sleeping should be a mutual choice.  You\u2019ve said no nicely.

She needs professional help.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mom has some insecurities about sleeping alone when your dad isn't there, but while I can sympathise with that, it really isn't your or your sisters problem to manage and she needs to find a way to deal with it, without burdening you.\n\nHave you spoken to your dad about this before, is he aware that this is happening? If he isn't, I would raise it to him.", "Refuse. Tell a teacher.", "NTA - your mother sounds batshit insane.\n\nThe only solution I can suggest is to eat all the beans, every night, and keep her awake with nightfarts", "Nta and this is odd and creepy behavior", "NTA\n\nYou mom isd creepy and an abusive AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk your dad for help! Tell him!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf nothing else helps, predtend to kick in your sleep: turn around, kick her hard, and pretend to be asleep.", "NTA. This is inappropriate and borders on abuse.", "OP - do you have a lock on your bedroom door? Is there anything stopping you from just going to your bedroom and locking the door? \n\nWill there be repercussions if you did that? \n\nIf it were me - I would just sleep with the door locked \nOr maybe if you have a really close friend, you could spend the night, at least it\u2019s one or so nights away \n\nLastly I would advice that you tell a trusted adult about this who\u2019s not your immediate family.", "If no trusted adult- Child Protective Services! May seem like an over-reaction, but this is an extreme violation of privacy.\n\nAm I the only one who got creeped out by the \u201cwhenever my dad & sister [aren\u2019t] in the house\u2026\u201d part?? Family counseling & parenting classes are needed here.", "My mom did this too. Same gender and still creepy. I wish she hadn\u2019t but no way could I say no to her. I\u2019d suggest doing it more politely but it takes time to learn how to be consistent, firm yet calm to an inferiorating AH who won\u2019t take no for an answer.", "My mum used to get my dad to call me down when he got up super early for work and climb in with her. When I was little it was a novelty being in their big massive bed but as I got older it became a chore and was annoying. I eventually just stopped doing it. But there was never anything other than her wanting the comfort of someone sleeping next to her. Yes he should have to do it for her comfort, but there doesn't have to be anything untoward going on here other than mother is so used to having someone next to her at night that she struggles to sleep at night alone. To be very clear, this is NOT op's problem, at all.", "ISTG, a post could be about unclipped toes and that\u2019s mods sometimes ban it for \u201cbodily autonomy\u201d.\n\n(No hate to mods, they do this undesirable job for literally free because they want to help the community, but come on now)", "Get her a f*ckin dog, right??", "Everything makes more sense now. I\u2019m gonna go feel weird for the next few weeks.", "I read that link, and is being nude infront of your child abusive? I bathe at the same time with my 2 y old, and in Finland ppl go to sauna nude with their kids, depending on age they go with same sex parent or sibling. How can just being naked be abusive, unless the parent has some sexual intentions to it of course.\n\nEdit: i think op's mom is horrible and absolutely incestuous. I hope op calls the cops and gets help.", "If not, option #2\u2026", "why did you feel the need to pull the reverse the genders card? everyone\u2019s alarm bells ARE ringing", "Lol.\n\nIf you would be happy swapping genders here if it's okay for a older man to demand his 14year old daughter in his bed. \n\nFuck if anything he should be escalating and shaming her more. \n\nI'd be posting on social media and tagging her friends I would be shaming her like it's Sunday school in the dark ages. \n\nThis is about as close to incest as it gets.", "Right, well at this point I think your only recourse is contacting child protective services, or publicly blasting her on social media (I don't know how much you are comfortable with this though). \n\nDoes she have Facebook? Make your own FB account and post this all over her page. Make it public. Tag CPS & the police. The down side of this is that other teenagers are jerks, and once something is online it's always online - don't know if you want people finding this in 5, 10, or 20 years.\n\nThe other thing you can do is tell a teacher. Or all the teachers. They are obligated to report on stuff like this. \n\nOr piss in her bed.", "This is AITA, I gave a judgment.", "What did that comment say?", "Asking if the judgement should be E-S-H if I found both parties to be somewhat in the wrong"]}
