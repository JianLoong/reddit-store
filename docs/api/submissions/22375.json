She's a very sweet girl and never asks for much so I always try to make sure she's taken care of. \n\nMy son and Isabella just got a job at a pool. I needed to buy my son a new pair of swim trunks and he needed some new shoes. Isabella was with us the day we went shopping so we took her with us. While we were in the car, my son told me Isabella's shoes were too small for her and he asked if I could get her shoes too. We got to the store and I told Isabella that her shoes looked a little worn out and to let me know if she sees anything she likes. \n\nShe came to me with a pair of sneakers off the clearance rack and asked if she could pay me back when she got her check. I told her not to worry about it and asked if there was anything else she needed. She said no, but when we were at target she came to me with a bathing suit, socks, and underwear and had the same promise that if I got it for her she'd pay me back when she got paid. \n\nI, again, told her not to worry about paying me back and threw everything in the cart. I knew she doesn't have a lot of clothes and what she does have isn't going to last much longer so I ended up taking her to the clothing section and to ross. I ended up getting her almost all new clothes. It's a pretty basic wardrobe (2 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of leggings, a few short sleeve shirts, a few long sleeve, a sweater, a jean jacket, a pack of socks, and a pack of underwear) but it should last her at least until Christmas. \n\nIsabella's mom reached out to me after we went shopping and berated me for buying Isabella's clothes and acting like they can't take care of their kids. I told her Isabella needed clothes and shoes. They weren't getting them for her so I did. It turned into an argument and Isabella texted me shortly after asking if I could pick her up. When I got there she had all of her new clothes and shoes in a garbage bag and asked to keep it at my house because her parents were mad.\n\nIsabella's mom and stepdad are still mad that I'm \"treating her like a charity case\" and \"refuse to make things equal for all of their kids\" (Isabella is one of 7).

No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA. You\u2019re a very kind person. I can understand her parents are probably insecure and embarrassed but if the girl needed clothes there\u2019s no ifs, ans, or buts about it. As a fellow girl whose family was not very well off when I was 12, I can say kids are absolute jerks and it\u2019s not an easy age. Also you\u2019re not creepy either, she picked out everything herself and you just acted like a parent that saw a child in need. You\u2019ve done a wonderful thing and your son and this girl  will always remember this kindness.", "NTA. Your son's friend was in need, you helped. Her parents are the asses. They are failing their many kids (seriously stop freaking breeding) and because of their insecurities they want the child to needlessly suffer, \nShe will remember you gave her something to feel normal, and she will remember her parents reaction.", "NTA. You did a kind thing. It is pretty shameful that two parents would deprive their own child purely out of their own self serving pride.", "I think Isabella and the rest of the kids deserve a better home. You\u2019re NTA at all. I get that they\u2019re struggling but they CHOSE to raise 7 kids and shouldn\u2019t anyone with common sense appreciate when someone helps them out especially with their children\u2019s well-being?? Thank you for actually stepping up and providing for the child like she deserves.", "NTA. Whether they could afford it or not isn\u2019t the issue. It was a gift, to her, and it was kind of you. Instead of being thankful they reacted prideful, selfish and embarrassed. You didn\u2019t help deescalate the situation by minimizing it was items on sale and you bought it because it was a good deal and instead kinda rubbed it in their faces that they aren\u2019t taking good enough care of their daughter, sooo sure it caused issues\u2026for Isabella and that\u2019s where there\u2019s a little bit of E S H. The adults are playing a game of pride tug-a-war but poor Isabelle is the one really caught in the middle. Poor kiddo.", "Nta but maybe just say the kids both went on a mini shopping spree instead if pointing out they can't afford stuff. Do you and the other parents have a good relationship other then what just happened? They might just be embarrassed. But it was still a nice gesture.", "The way you explained it is the only part that makes you TA. When people aren't doing okay financially, there's a certain element of shame involved - you basically said 'well, she needed new clothes, you guys couldn't afford to clothe your own kid so I did'. \n\nYou could have easily reframed it; 'the kids went on a shopping spree, I told them both they could spend X amount as my treat. I meant no offence, it was just an activity...a bit like taking them to the movies'. That way, you cause less hassle for the child, you don't offend the parents and the end result is the same.", "NTA however, I'm sure you can understand how this might have affected her parents pride. You did a good thing and I'm sure Isabella will remember it.", "NTA. \nYou did something kind for a child in need.\nYou're not responsible for the parents pride/shame.\nI don't blame you for being somewhat blunt when they called you out for supporting one of their children. As other have said. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NAH. You're not inherently wrong for wanting to help out Isabella, but I'll try and attempt to give you the struggling parent's perspective.\n\nI had a friend like this. I was organising senior jackets for my class, and my friend wanted one, but didn't have the money for it. I told my parents who immediately said they would buy her one, but they didn't want their names disclosed. So I told my friend an 'anonymous' parent was willing to buy one for her.\nShe was THRILLED and told her mom. \n\nBut her mom called me and got really defensive which made me feel small, since I was just trying to help out. I knew how much my friend wanted the jacket and explained this to her, to which she replied \"it's my duty to fulfil my child's needs and wants, so while I appreciate the intention I insist that you let ME pay for the jacket - even if it means I have to struggle to pay for it.\" After this interaction I realised one thing - NO parent wants to be reminded of the fact that they aren't doing enough. No one wants to feel inadequate and be reminded of the fact they aren't even able to finance basic requirements for their child. \n\n>I told Isabella's mom her kid needed clothes and shoes. They weren't getting them for her so I did.\n\nIn case you didn't realise it yet, this is extremely condescending. I understand that in some cases financial instability is the result of poor decision making but it is NONE of your business to berate another parent about it. Isabella's mom is feeling small that her life decisions have brought her to a point where she can't even afford basic things like clothes for her children. And you are arguing with this point, expecting her not to feel that you're doing charity? It doesn't work that way.\n\nYour intentions are great but you need to be more sensitive. Draw the line between charity and gifting. A pair of shoes is a gift. Buying multiple clothes including even underwear is basically providing her needs. This may differ from case to case depending on what people deem fit enough for a gift, but for a struggling mother; It's a slap to her dignity. So I can understand why she reacted that way. Did she have to be rude and ungrateful? Absolutely not, it was uncalled for - but there is some merit in what she's saying.\n\nMy advice to you is not to take her words to heart, she's just defending herself. She knows all her kids deserve better deep down, but I think you need to have a talk with her and explicitly ask her what she's ok with you buying for her daughter. And if she doesn't want you buying anything, respect her wishes. People deserve to feel like they're capable of at least attempting to financially stabilise themselves. I still commend you for being empathetic, just...be a little more sensitive.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold u/lovedeathrobots27 !!", "YTA.  I get it, your intentions were good.  But you went overboard, buying her a whole closet full of clothes.  She brought you shoes.  You bought them.  DONE.  If you'd have just stopped there.   By literally replacing everything she owns and then some, you have greatly insulted her parents who did not ask for your help.", "ESH. You stepped out of line without consulting her parents first before you bought the clothes. Her parents very well may have had certain standards for clothes for their children and you made an arbitrary decision without them. But they overreacted a bit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d be mortified if anyone had done that for me, but wouldn\u2019t think anything of doing it for someone else; some people just have different incomes, doesn\u2019t make them better or worse (or rather, in this case, the income does seem to have to go further).", "I agree, he isn't TA for buying stuff the girl needed but we don't know their story, maybe they could previously afford to get all their kids new clothes and everything maybe they've fallen on hard times and are struggling right now idk but rubbing that in their faces isn't the right way to help the kid out. \n\nI personally would be happy if that was the case and someone was kind enough to help out one of my kids but coming from a large family with 9 siblings of my own, i can absolutely understand that her coming home with a whole new wardrobe was probably really hard for her siblings.

So, while there trying not to disappoint the wife, my kids asked if we could get something for your daughter.  I figured, what the hell, can't be fun watching a grown man screw up and do a last-minute shopping trip with his kids. Might as well let all the kids have some fun trying on clothes.   Disaster averted, everyone had fun and the wife is happy, two birds, one stone, ya know?  I'm sorry, I probably should have called and asked, i didn't mean to overstep.\"  Good. \n\nYou don't have to be so honest about everything, especially if the other parents feel weird about being broke or struggling.

They are trying to provide for 7 children, which isn't going to be easy unless you are independently wealthy.  ONE of those children comes home with a whole closet full of new clothes.  That's a problem for many reasons.  First, you think the other six kids  won't notice?  Now the parents are the bad guys as  they can't give all 7 kids a whole closet full of new clothes.  You can't half-ass this shit.  If you want to help 1, you gotta help all 7.  Then there is the fact that the parents are very obviously struggling, as far as money goes.  To the  point where the girls' shoes are too small.  Yikes.  I don't know the specifics, but the parents sure do.  And they don't need to be reminded of their financial problems by someone rubbing their nose in them...\n\nYou could think of it this way.

My senior year of high school, my best friend told me she wouldn\u2019t be able to go to prom because her parents couldn\u2019t afford the dress, tickets, etc. I was devastated and told my mom and step dad, and they offered to pay for everything. \n\nWe were going to rent a limo, however since BFFs dad had a black SUV, he dressed in a suit and was our chauffeur the whole night.

Nobody wants to be told they're not doing enough for their children, and someone else buying clothing for their kids (with the obvious implication that they couldn't afford it themselves) comes off as extremely condescending. \n\nTo soften the blow, you could have told her parents that Isabella fully intended to pay you back once she was able to, that this was effectively a \"loan.\" (Even though you repeatedly told her it was your treat). \n\nAlso - you've got to understand the dynamic in a large (and not well-to-do) family. If one member comes into a windfall - however that windfall came - it generates hurt feelings, jealousy, etc. It is possible that Isabella's parents were making her return the stuff not only because they were embarrassed about not being able to adequately provide for their daughter, but because the other siblings were in an uproar and getting rid of Isabella's new clothes was the easiest expedient to rid themselves of the source of discontent.", "You were generous.

It's a beautiful gesture but just talking with the parents beforehand would have been the right decision.", "NTA but a little diplomacy would have helped Isabelle.  She needed help.  That means being sensitive to pride, often the only thing working class people have.  Perhaps you could have bought Isabelle the clothes and then found 'a job' in your home for her to do.  To save the situation, speak to her parents (only if Isabelle says okay) about 'hiring' Isabelle to do some chore (along with at least one sibling or family member present) that will pay for the clothing.
