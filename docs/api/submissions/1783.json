{"id": 1783, "submission_id": "ypi19l", "title": "AITA for refusing to delete a post off social media because my Grandmother says it reflects badly on the family?", "selftext": "This is my very first post on Reddit, so I hope I'm doing this right. Two days ago, I 23f shared a post on my page related to PTSD and issues raised living with a dysfunctional family. I did not tag nor target anyone specifically when I shared the post. Later in the day, I called my Grandmother (the only semi-healthy family member I interact with on both sides of my family) and was video chatting with her while prepping dinner. After a while, I could tell she was upset about something so I asked her what was wrong. She told me she was pissed off at me. I couldn't figure out what I had done so I asked her to give me specifics. She told me the post I shared in the middle of the night upset her and the whole family and reflected badly on her. She then remarked that my life was not that bad. I was taken aback and became really upset. She told me to delete the post and think about what I post next time. I was crying by that point and hung up on her. I have been going back and forth on whether I should delete the post but now I am refusing to do so. It's on my own social media page so why should I cater to others? So, AITA?\n\nETA-I think it may help if I add some background information on myself and generally my family. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Dissociative Disorders. I have been in therapy my whole life but now with my current therapist, I feel comfortable  enough to share my trauma. Currently I am learning how to set boundaries and express suppressed emotions; essentially processing my past now when I wasn't able to before. My parents are out of the picture as they were extremely abusive/toxic. My Grandmother raised me for half my life but there were still toxic and manipulative tendencies she displayed. These past few days have been rough emotionally, as I am now grieving for the last member of my family I thought I could lean on. But now I realize how toxic she is as well. I guess this is a semi update more than an ETA, but I wanted to share that I just had an emergency session with my therapist to process my physical and emotional reaction to these last few days, and I feel validated with how I feel and will be seeking a support group. Your comments have been helpful to get a 100% outside perspective to my current situation and I greatly appreciate it! I will continue to read your comments and reply to all I can/if I feel its necessary. Thanks again!\n\nI wanted to add another edit since some are stating I aired out my families dirty laundry. As I stated in my original post, I shared a from another page on social media. Perhaps I should've specified that this post was shared from a C-PTSD and Me page with the title saying \"Things you might miss when youre from a dysfunctional family\" with 10 things listed such as \"being able to express your emotions openly,\" having typical worries as a child, not one who had to grow up too fast\" etc. I did not write the post, only shared something I related to.

So when a mother or someone doesn\u2019t want anyone to post their child on social media, then that mother is in the right. But when a family member doesn\u2019t want to get posted, then it\u2019s not their right?  There\u2019s no reason for you to post about family trauma on social media cuz some people may not want you to talk about family problems.", "Nta, the truth hurts, but it not your problem op, she is just face with the reality and just wants you to hide it to make herself feel better,  your feelings and experience invalid, and if she doesn't like it tough sh\u00a1t.", "As you noted, your grandmother is also toxic. She waited to see if you would notice that she was mad and then made you fish for the reason why?? \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve lost this source of support. Unfortunately, when our parents behave badly, we can often find the roots of that behavior in our, *now* loving, grandparents. You deserve better OP, and I\u2019m glad this has helped you feel validated because YOUR FEELINGS ARE ALWAYS VALID. Period.\n\nSending you a million hugs. NTA.", "YTA Don\u2019t air your dirty laundry on socials. If you need support, talk with your friends or your therapist. Not every Tom, Dick nor Harry needs to know your personal business.", "NTA..the fact she took that post to personally is because she knows the family is guilty.", "Soft YTA - you can post whatever you want on your social media, this is very true.  However, you called out family in your post.  Anyone who knows you knows that this does includes your Grandmother.  Remember, YOU called her for something completely irrelevant to the post while you were cooking dinner when she brought up the post.  You have a connection with her as family or you wouldn't have called.  She might have her problems like you said but part of me believes that you threw that in there to convince us readers.  If you re-read your post and feel that what is said does NOT apply to her in any way shape or form, then you need to take it down or put a disclaimer in there so whoever reads it knows you are not talking about her.  Or not and invite her to have a discussion about it and why it is important to you.  Either way, she is family, you called out family on your social media, and now you're being held accountable for that.", "Honor your mother and father. Putting out dirty laundry for everyone to see is incredibly\nImmature. But if her upbringing is as bad as she says it\u2019s best to avoid that part of the family all together. Sharing it for everyone around you to see  is something I never understood about social media.", "I added another edit to clarify anything that may have been misunderstood from this post. I did not write a post blasting members of my family. I shared a post from a page called C-PTSD and Me that I related to. It had things listed such as being able to express your emotions openly, having a stable home to return to, feeling connected to others, etc. Idk if my reply helps at all but I understand your judgement and perspective in the situation.", "Agreed"]}
