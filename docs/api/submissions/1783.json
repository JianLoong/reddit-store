I'm sorry she made you cry, it's not worth your tears.\n\nWhat I find interesting, though, is that she felt personally attacked and insulted even though you said your post wasn't about someone specific. It's a topic many people talk about...\n\nIf my sister posted the same, I would see that as a new info, something to learn and not immediately jump to a conclusion that she's talking about our family or even wilder - me.\n\nShe felt called out and based on her reaction I can only guess it was deserved. I wouldn't delete anything. If it bothers her or anyone else, they can block you, or even better - try to figure out why they feel called out and how to fix it rather than police your posts.", "NTA. \n\nYou can post what you want on your social media. \n\nShe\u2019s just embarrassed because she knows there\u2019s truth in what you posted and doesn\u2019t want people to know.", "NTA.   \nFirst, she cannot decide if your life is/was or isn't/ wasn't that bad. That's not for her to decide.\n\nSecond, your social media is for you to post whatever you want. You've kept names out of it so people can't give you crap for that.\n\nThird, If she's so worried on 'how it would look' then maybe she should tak to those family members and their behaviour instead of yours.", "NTA but time to block family on social media. toxic families tend to try and edit the public version of what went down. it's your right to own your own story.", "NTA it's your social, not hers. Especially fine since, as you said, it wasn't targeted towards anyone specific, nor was it obvious who it was about. \n\nAe long as you're comfortable it being there it's fine.\n\nYour life not being 'too bad' in the eyes of someone else doesn't mean you should keep quiet about it.", "No. You are NTA. \n\nWe should be OK about talking about mental illness. Stigmatization is real and BS. Your grandma is following outdated social norms of hiding and stigmatizing mental illness, and that is NOT OK. It's understandable in older generations who grew up under different standards, but it is still wrong.", "NTA. Regardless of what she thinks or what is objectively true, you feel a certain way and she should not devalue your thoughts / feelings.", "NTA. You can post whatever you like. But, what did you expect? If your family is on your social media... of course they aren't going to be happy with that. Even if it's true. \n\nAlso, another thing to consider... if you didn't \"target anyone specifically\" then that means anyone who reads that will suspect everyone in your family. I'm a big fan of placing blame exactly where it should be. I grew up with a highly abusive brother. And in the rare instances I speak of him, I've *always* made sure to say, \"my brother was abusive.\" Not something like \"I have a close family member who is really abusive.\" Being ambiguous can reflect badly on the wrong person.", "ESH. For obvious reasons, your family sucks. But also, I\u2019m not sure how you expected to post dirty laundry about your family, knowing your family follows your social media, and then act surprised pikachu face when the family is pissed for airing out said dirty laundry on a public platform.", "\"It's on my own social media page so why should I cater to others?\"\n\nYou don't have to cater to anyone, but don't be surprised if you end up going from one healthy relationship to zero healthy relationships. \n\nThis attitude will just lead to being very lonely and angry.  \n\nNAH", "NTA. You didn't mention specifics just your truth. It's terrible she is trying to get you to erase your belief and truth just because it hurts the family. Well what about you? It's okay as long as no one else sees the hurt that your family put you through?\n\nDon't delete it unless you feel that it needs to be taken down. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Having a toxic family is bad enough but having to pretend they're not toxic is a step too far.", "NTA.  The fact that she was more concerned about your silence than your well being is a big giveaway.\n\nChosen families are valid too.  DNA means nothing.  Go out and choose your real family.", "NAH. It\u2019s your account to post as you see fit, but airing dirty laundry on identifiable social media  clearly has its consequences.  \n\n\nThink of it  like a shallow pond. Do you want to toss a pebble in there and enjoy the beauty of the ripples or do you want to throw the biggest rock you can find and splash everyone around you with muck from the bottom of the pond?  Most of the time I choose the pebble, but sometimes I pick the rock. I don\u2019t do it on social media.", "Nah. It is your account and you can post what you want.  But just like you want to remind them that actions have consequences so do yours. Whether you like it or not, this has upset your grandmother and that's a relationship you seem to value. If you truly do then I would delete the post because you love her not because it's not true.", "NTA\n\nShe cannot edit your experiences because talking about them reflects badly on the family. Just don't do stuff that reflects badly on your family if you don't want to look bad when those on the receiving end of your toxic behaviour talk about what they went through. Because you know you did something wrong if you're that worried about others finding out.", "NAH, you don't have to cater to others.\n\nThey don't have to cater to you.  \n\nYour free to share your personal experiences, but since your also sharing things others have done, it should be kind of expected that they will take issue with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why? They are actually proving my point. \n\nI am trying to figure out if you\u2019re actually upset or if you\u2019re simply responding to the outrage from other family members. Our relationship is important to me, but honestly it\u2019s more important because you\u2019re the best person in the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic that I am actually having really bad feelings over posting some thing honest because my families helping to prove why it\u2019s true. I\u2019m trying to be healthy and I\u2019m going to be honest. And I\u2019m not going to pretend in my own business and life that my reality was different than it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying that in order to continue being my grandma that I have to pretend? I didn\u2019t intend to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings and people should ask themselves why they are so offended? Maybe in a different family they would actually be expressing concern instead of feeling blamed?\u201d\n\nIf OP would consider unfriending her family that\u2019s another option or at least on Instagram or wherever this was posted so she can make her account private. \u201cYou guys are upset by general posts about my own mental health, it isn\u2019t good for my mental health to have you put pressure on me instead of expressing concern, it means you don\u2019t need to be looking at my social media.\u201d\n\nHaving come from a generation we\u2019re not everything is posted there may be another way to be honest without putting yourself in the crossfire. Until you get healthier and more independent it may be better not to post such things not because you\u2019re wrong but because it isn\u2019t wise for your health!\n\nNTA", "This, 1000x this.

Your post, your social media, take it down or leave it up as you see fit.\n\nBut also: your consequences of your actions.

You did the cardinal sin in a dysfunctional family and let the entire world know about it. She's embarrassed because she knows her family is a hot mess.

Sure technically you can post what you want, but the audacity and ridiculousness of airing your family\u2019s dirty laundry on social media, publicly shading them, and then being upset that they dare have a reaction or opinion on it is insane. \n\nTrying to dishonestly hide behind \u201cI didn\u2019t tag or directly mention anyone\u201d is also truly an asshole move. \n\nYou posted what you wanted and they reacted accordingly.", "NTA", "I\u2019ve been in that exact situation.

So I stopped hiding what they did and I started posting and adding the receipts (text messages, photos, etc) and from that I\u2019ve gotten so much love and support from my friends and the family that actually cared about me and didn\u2019t know.

It is your page, you shouldn't have to police yourself for others, but that means you also have to accept that others are going to react in a way you may not appreciate, like or agree with. There will always be fallout. They have their own perceptions of what happened in their lives with you which are also valid, and making public the darker parts may be something they're not ready to face, or feel. They may have a very different reason for their own trauma in those events, and you may not come out as clean as you perceive yourself from another's perception. There are always consequences to bringing your truth to light, both good and bad.", "I certainly agree that you can and should post what you want. If that's how you feel then by all means do it!
