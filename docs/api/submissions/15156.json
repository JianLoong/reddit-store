Last year I was the treasurer where I met \u2018Theo\u2019 (27M) who was the president at the time. We became good friends and even decided to live together with 2 other friends this year. \n\u00a0\nThis year started off great, however about a month in I noticed that Theo and a lot of the society started suddenly getting really frosty with me. It got really uncomfortable (eg. I got \u2018accidentally removed\u2019 from the group chat and never readded even when I asked). My best friend \u2018Katie\u2019 (23F) found out that some rumours had come out against me- that I had been insulting Theo\u2019s leadership last year and that I STOLE MONEY from the charity fund when I was treasurer. I panicked as this wasn\u2019t true and immediately messaged the charity officer. They replied and said there was no money lost and the rumour was false. I was still anxious as things like this could get me kicked out of the society but potentially university as well.\n\u00a0\nEventually I found out that it was Theo who was spreading the rumours. I didn\u2019t believe it until I was shown messages from him saying this stuff and telling people not to trust me. I was really hurt and that night I moved out of our house to live with my girlfriend. I haven\u2019t spoken to Theo since, but Katie told me that he made up loads of excuses saying that I was \u2018authoritarian\u2019 as a treasurer and that I was \u2018suspicious\u2019 with funds. I have no idea why he\u2019s spreading these rumours now but he has blocked me on everything and refuses to talk to me.\n\u00a0\nThis is where I might be TA. I talked to Katie about this and she told me to go to the student union and report him- he has accused me of so many lies and made it almost impossible for me to enjoy the society I loved and I am well within my right to report him for bullying. So I did. Theo is now going up for disciplinary with the student union and has a meeting with the university. He is in the last year of his degree and he already has a strike against his name when he was involved in a drunken night out (I don\u2019t know much about it but apparently Theo was just caught in the crossfire). Basically this means he could be kicked out. Most of my friends have taken my side but my old roommates are all calling me TA for putting Theo\u2019s degree at risk over just a few rumours. He has a really good graduate job lined up and being kicked out would mess up his life. I could pull back my complaint but I know Theo is involved in welfare right now and it just doesn\u2019t sit right for me for him to be in this position of authority when he\u2019s been spreading false rumours and kind of bullying me.

He showed no remorse and completely iced you out when you tried to talk to him reasonably. These aren't just rumors. He tried to jeopardize YOUR career and life. Those rumors cost you opportunities to network and could have cost you job opportunities. He has proven himself incapable to lead and he could hurt someone vulnerable in welfare", "NTA. Luckily no money was missing so you could clear the rumor. IF Theo hid money and put the blame on you, you couldn\u2019t have, that could have been the case easily.", "YWNBTA \n\nhe sounds like he's never had repercussions for being a dick. You'd be doing everyone in his future a huge favor", "WNBTA. You're not responsible for a grown adult male that has made his own decisions to put his own credibility and reputation on the line. People with power should know their actions have consequences if those actions are unjust. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, I say.", "NTA. The consequences of his actions are a whole lot of not your problem. He's a grown man who made decisions that could bite him in the ass one day. If you didn't bring that day someone else would eventually.", "NTA if you feel the bullying thing is worthy of reporting. If so, let it ride. I could be wrong, but I think it would be unlikely for them to kick him out. They might discipline him but let him finish out his degree since he's close to finishing. Plus, any disciplinary action would be passed along to said society so that they get back to the truth about everything. It's a lesson he might need to learn now before he takes such actions into the real world.", "NTA - you\u2019re reputation isn\u2019t less important than his, you can\u2019t start rumours and expect zero consequences.", "NTA - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. It is pretty foolish choice of actions by someone who already has a strike against their name. I'd comfort myself knowing that you're potentially preventing someone else from being impacted by his toxicity, and likewise who's to say he wouldn't do something else to get himself kicked out anyways.", "You won\u2019t be TA. He could come to you and apologize, if he isn\u2019t willing to swallow his pride, why should you care.", "You will not be the asshole OP, Theo is just facing the consequences of his actions.

Worst case scenario is that they tell Theo he can\u2019t return the following year and he applies to and enrolls at a different university.  His credits will transfer.

Theo is reaping the consequences of his own actions.", "NTA I would tell your former roommates that you will consider withdrawing the complaint if Theo apologizes to you both personally and publicly and if he gives up his society position and withdraws from the society as well, after making it clear to all members that you were completely innocent of all the accusations he made against you. If he really thinks he might get kicked out then he should be happy to eat some crow and give up the society to have you drop the complaint. I\u2019d probably insist that he put it all in writing and have his admission of his behavior and his apology notarized so you have proof in case it comes back to haunt you later. I would check with the Student Union to clarify that you making this deal won\u2019t get you in trouble first though. If making a deal to drop the complaint isn\u2019t okay or if they insist on having an official mediator there or something I would follow their rules carefully. I would probably ask them to have a mediator present regardless though when you give him your terms for dropping it. You can also see if this carries the risk of him being kicked out of school or not. If that isn\u2019t a risk from your complaint then I might just let him sweat and learn a lesson. Regardless, I wouldn\u2019t drop it without making him clean up the mess he made and making sure he gives you evidence that you can use to prove your innocence in case he decides to retaliate by filing a complaint against you as soon as you withdraw yours. He sounds like the type that would absolutely do something to get revenge so get some solid evidence of your innocence if you decide to drop it.", "NTA.

As long as you are telling the truth, unlike Theo over here, you\u2019re doing the right thing. He made his choices past and present, you\u2019re not responsible for covering for a man making false accusations against you, and even if it weren\u2019t against YOU, if you were aware of such a situation you should still go to the proper people.
