The mammographer commented it was a shame so many more people were getting cancer now due to poor lifestyle choices.

Please report her, that would trigger many women unnecessarily. If we knew the cause we\u2019d know the cure.", "NTA at all.  The mammographer was horribly unprofessional and insensitive for saying that.  I\u2019m sure they were talking generally and not suggesting that you caused your own cancer but they should have sufficient situational awareness to realise how that would sound and they absolutely should know better.  If you\u2019re in the UK (which I\u2019m thinking you may be by your terminology) you should report it to the PALS team at the trust involved.  If not then report it in writing to the manager of the mammo dept.  It won\u2019t get the person fired but they will be given a bloody good talking to and hopefully some communication as well as a warning against future incidents.", "NTA \nFellow breast cancer survivor here, and I say that the mammographer was unprofessional, as if she was accusing you of having a poor lifestyle and that's why you got breast cancer.  It's one step away from \"your fault\".\n\n Among other things, it's wrong: if today there are so many early cancer diagnoses in young women it's because there is more awareness and prevention.  Once upon a time, cancer was discovered at an advanced age because there were no checks before.", "NTA That was a really insensitive and unnecessary comment. She should be reprimanded for it. I\u2019m sorry she said that to you. Mammograms are bad enough without having to hear that kind of bullshit.", "NTA...if you felt emotionally sensitive,  then so do many others.  No matter what her intentions, that was an inappropriate remark. Everyone needs training and reminders on how to better serve their customers/patients.", "NTA\n\n>I know I can be a little more emotional around the cancer thing,\n\nMaybe I'm wrong but I would assume many, if not most, people in your situation are. Those people need to have some tact and certainty shouldn't be saying things to shame cancer patients.", "NTA.  Your anger is justified and you should definitely say something to a supervisor so they can, at the very least, make this tech aware.  It doesn't have to be a formal complaint, more of an FYI.  People in patient-facing positions in the medical field really need to be aware of what they say and sometimes, how they say what they say.  In this instance, especially, where you're there hoping for a clean bill of health.  The last thing you want to hear is someone's un-informed opinion of what may or may not be going on with your body and why.   Undoubtedly she was not trying to be offensive.  She just maybe needs a little sensitivity training to continue in a position like hers.", "NTA. Her comment was extremely inappropriate and unprofessional. You are not the asshole to report it.", "NTA, especially if you submit a polite statement saying that this simply bothered you. You don't want this person to lose their job, but yeah they should be aware that their comment was a little hurtful. Maybe this was just one awkward comment, but it's also possible that this person has a pattern of awkward comments that they need to start reconsidering!", "NTA. The person may have just had a dumb slip out, or really is misinformed and was rude. You could approach it gently to remind them that implying that it is the cancer patients fault is unprofessional.", "NTA. She needs to work on her bedside manner. Not a cool comment to make, especially because it\u2019s such a sensitive topic. She doesn\u2019t know what caused it, no reason to judge. Shame on her.", "NTA. Please report her. That\u2019s incredibly inappropriate. Not to mention factually inaccurate.", "NTA. She\u2019s flat out wrong and inappropriate. There\u2019s a rise in diagnosed cancer cases because medical science and technology has gotten better at detecting cancer.", "Fellow breast cancer survivor.\n\nIn the US, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nEff her and her \"bad lifestyle choices!\" Report it and maybe she'll smarten up before insulting more people.", "NTA. \n\nYou're right. It is off. Unfortunately cancer, it its various forms, affects lots of people, either by their own diagnosis/treatment and/or the diagnosis/treatment/loss of loved ones. I personally would be concerned by the potential impacts, both the more immediate emotional impact on a patient on the receiving end of a comment like that, and the longer-term physical impact if it put the patient off attending checks and a diagnosis was missed as result - maybe I'm reaching, but it is possible and I don't like that possibility. She at the least needs some sensitivity training.  \n\nNow, if you don't want to make a full on complaint, you could go down the 'feedback' route instead.", "NTA. It's not her boobs, it not HER life, fears, and all that awful stuff. She's doing a job, and while it is a hard job (being the first one to see \"yep, this is not going to be easy\" sort of stuff), she's not entitled to to pass judgement.", "NTA\n\nWhat even are the lifestyle risk factors for breast cancer because I don\u2019t think there are any.", "NTA OP if you report her as most people here are rec.\nMedical people are held to a higher standard.Only you can decide if she was just stupid or malevolent.I think the way you phrased this as her being more careful is very thoughtful .", "NTA.  Report it.\n\nYou were naked (or barely covered) from the waist up, having already survived a cancer battle.  I'm a cancer (not breast) survivor and from the moment of diagnosis to remission, I felt very vulnerable all the time.  At each scan I get, it all comes back.  It's an extremely delicate time for me, wondering if this scan will be normal or will this be the one that tells me the cancer has returned.  I suspect it's the same for you.  \n\nEither she knew this and didn't care, or she's ignorant.  Either way, she needs to be reported so she doesn't do this again, either by education or finding another field.", "YWNBTA. No one gets breast cancer from \"lifestyle choices\", and that comment was \\*completely\\* out of line.  Report them, and have a note put in your chart that you don't want her doing your mammograms in the future.", "NTA - but probably better addressed to the individual. I know you weren\u2019t in the emotional state to say that at the time, reach out to her and let her know now that you\u2019ve stepped back.", "YWBTA nobody does that so they take it more seriously when someone does exaggerating the problem into a bigger one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
