Please report her, that would trigger many women unnecessarily. If we knew the cause we\u2019d know the cure.", "NTA at all.  The mammographer was horribly unprofessional and insensitive for saying that.  I\u2019m sure they were talking generally and not suggesting that you caused your own cancer but they should have sufficient situational awareness to realise how that would sound and they absolutely should know better.  If you\u2019re in the UK (which I\u2019m thinking you may be by your terminology) you should report it to the PALS team at the trust involved.  If not then report it in writing to the manager of the mammo dept.  It won\u2019t get the person fired but they will be given a bloody good talking to and hopefully some communication as well as a warning against future incidents.", "NTA \nFellow breast cancer survivor here, and I say that the mammographer was unprofessional, as if she was accusing you of having a poor lifestyle and that's why you got breast cancer.  It's one step away from \"your fault\".\n\n Among other things, it's wrong: if today there are so many early cancer diagnoses in young women it's because there is more awareness and prevention.  Once upon a time, cancer was discovered at an advanced age because there were no checks before.", "NTA That was a really insensitive and unnecessary comment. She should be reprimanded for it. I\u2019m sorry she said that to you. Mammograms are bad enough without having to hear that kind of bullshit.", "NTA...if you felt emotionally sensitive,  then so do many others.  No matter what her intentions, that was an inappropriate remark. Everyone needs training and reminders on how to better serve their customers/patients.", "NTA\n\n>I know I can be a little more emotional around the cancer thing,\n\nMaybe I'm wrong but I would assume many, if not most, people in your situation are. Those people need to have some tact and certainty shouldn't be saying things to shame cancer patients.", "NTA.  Your anger is justified and you should definitely say something to a supervisor so they can, at the very least, make this tech aware.  It doesn't have to be a formal complaint, more of an FYI.  People in patient-facing positions in the medical field really need to be aware of what they say and sometimes, how they say what they say.  In this instance, especially, where you're there hoping for a clean bill of health.  The last thing you want to hear is someone's un-informed opinion of what may or may not be going on with your body and why.   Undoubtedly she was not trying to be offensive.  She just maybe needs a little sensitivity training to continue in a position like hers.", "NTA. Her comment was extremely inappropriate and unprofessional. You are not the asshole to report it.", "NTA, especially if you submit a polite statement saying that this simply bothered you. You don't want this person to lose their job, but yeah they should be aware that their comment was a little hurtful. Maybe this was just one awkward comment, but it's also possible that this person has a pattern of awkward comments that they need to start reconsidering!", "NTA. The person may have just had a dumb slip out, or really is misinformed and was rude. You could approach it gently to remind them that implying that it is the cancer patients fault is unprofessional.", "NTA. She needs to work on her bedside manner. Not a cool comment to make, especially because it\u2019s such a sensitive topic. She doesn\u2019t know what caused it, no reason to judge. Shame on her.", "NTA. Please report her. That\u2019s incredibly inappropriate. Not to mention factually inaccurate.", "NTA. She\u2019s flat out wrong and inappropriate. There\u2019s a rise in diagnosed cancer cases because medical science and technology has gotten better at detecting cancer.", "Fellow breast cancer survivor.\n\nIn the US, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nEff her and her \"bad lifestyle choices!\" Report it and maybe she'll smarten up before insulting more people.", "NTA. \n\nYou're right. It is off. Unfortunately cancer, it its various forms, affects lots of people, either by their own diagnosis/treatment and/or the diagnosis/treatment/loss of loved ones. I personally would be concerned by the potential impacts, both the more immediate emotional impact on a patient on the receiving end of a comment like that, and the longer-term physical impact if it put the patient off attending checks and a diagnosis was missed as result - maybe I'm reaching, but it is possible and I don't like that possibility. She at the least needs some sensitivity training.  \n\nNow, if you don't want to make a full on complaint, you could go down the 'feedback' route instead.", "NTA. It's not her boobs, it not HER life, fears, and all that awful stuff. She's doing a job, and while it is a hard job (being the first one to see \"yep, this is not going to be easy\" sort of stuff), she's not entitled to to pass judgement.", "NTA\n\nWhat even are the lifestyle risk factors for breast cancer because I don\u2019t think there are any.", "NTA OP if you report her as most people here are rec.\nMedical people are held to a higher standard.Only you can decide if she was just stupid or malevolent.I think the way you phrased this as her being more careful is very thoughtful .", "NTA.  Report it.\n\nYou were naked (or barely covered) from the waist up, having already survived a cancer battle.  I'm a cancer (not breast) survivor and from the moment of diagnosis to remission, I felt very vulnerable all the time.  At each scan I get, it all comes back.  It's an extremely delicate time for me, wondering if this scan will be normal or will this be the one that tells me the cancer has returned.  I suspect it's the same for you.  \n\nEither she knew this and didn't care, or she's ignorant.  Either way, she needs to be reported so she doesn't do this again, either by education or finding another field.", "YWNBTA. No one gets breast cancer from \"lifestyle choices\", and that comment was \\*completely\\* out of line.  Report them, and have a note put in your chart that you don't want her doing your mammograms in the future.", "NTA - but probably better addressed to the individual. I know you weren\u2019t in the emotional state to say that at the time, reach out to her and let her know now that you\u2019ve stepped back.", "YWBTA nobody does that so they take it more seriously when someone does exaggerating the problem into a bigger one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nobody does what? Complain about nurses being insensitive to their patients? Because I sure as hell would.", "NTA. I found out that I have a lesser known gene that increases my risk of breast cancer (and other cancers) so I have to get screened regularly too. I am 37, and have to be screened now for breast and skin cancer annually. I already get my kidneys tested every 6 months due to lupus and I start colon cancer screening at 40. I would have been very offended by those comments. Nothing I did caused me to be the only person in my family with this gene. There are a lot of things that are outside of our control. Blaming or shaming people who are already stressed, or flat out scared is not helpful.", "I will be downvoted heavily but I think YWBTAH.\n\nSociety really gets offended by anything nowadays. \n\nShe did not said that you deserved it or you caused it. She just said that nowadays we (generally and starting from young age) put sooo many cancerogenic substances in our bodies willingly or not that it is a real issue.

When I was four months pregnant I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and had a mass on my cervix about the size of a golf ball. I proceeded with my pregnancy and carried my daughter to term. 8 weeks postpartum they removed the mass- in the 10 years since I have had three additional incidents. It\u2019s in my medical history. I went to donate blood and there was a questionnaire prior to - have you ever been diagnosed with any form of cancer? I circled yes to be safe. The tech asked why I circled yes - I told her my medical history and that I was unsure if that qualified as a yes on the questionnaire and had marked yes just in case. She said - you\u2019ve never had real cancer and you need to stop claiming you have. I was so taken aback by it and just left the blood bus after donating feeling embarrassed and confused.", "YWNBTA at all. I say this as someone who works in healthcare complaints... please do raise this as a formal complaint. This person was unprofessional and out of line. Complaints aren't for punishment but for learning purposes so that employees can improve their behaviours and provide a better standard of care, which is important for you and other patients. Raising it formally also means there is a record of the incident in question.", "Congrats on 8 years! I\u2019m an 11 year survivor & I\u2019d be pissed if that was said to me. Please contact her managers so she doesn\u2019t do something like that to someone again. I can\u2019t imagine how I would have handled that only 1 or 2 years out. I would have been a mess!! NTA", "This 100%. You are NTA. My mom had to report the nurse who tried to shame her after she got her gall bladder removed. MOST people who need them removed are women around my mom's age who are alcoholics. Barring when we went on vacation (years after the surgery!) and she got drunk, she drinks maybe one glass of wine a month and once or twice a year goes to a winery for a tasting, definitely not an alcoholic. Anyways, as soon as the nurse came into the room, the nurse did not even ask her about her lifestyle, she immediately said women like her (my mother) need to take care of themselves and stop being alcoholics, it is a poor lifestyle choice, blah blah blah, and did not believe my mother when she told her how much she drinks. My mom reported her and got a new nurse, but definitely not the best way to meet her nurse. Even if she was an alcoholic, still not how you treat someone!", "My former female gynecologist told me that \"we are all going to pay for abortion\" by much higher breast cancer rates. The study claiming a correlation between abortion and the higher breast cancer rates had been firmly debunked by then, but she just refused to acknowledge it. She let her politics and theology get in the way.", "I mean some parents don't want to get their kids vaccinated against HPV...

[Here\u2019s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459171/) the StatPearls for cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), alcohol isn\u2019t even listed. Alcohol causes liver and pancreatic issues but it\u2019s not at all true that most people having a cholecystectomy are alcoholic. Also we say alcohol/substance use disorder now, not just call people \u201calcoholics\u201d all willy nilly.", "That\u2019s strange. I\u2019ve never heard of that being a risk factor for gall bladder issues. My mom, my sister, myself and my 19 year old daughter have all had ours removed and none of us drinks regularly!", "My dad went through this last year! Misdiagnosed with pancreatitis and was told to go to AA when it turned out to be gall stones. The ER  caught it but once admitted, that doctor ignored the gall bladder and went straight to pancreatitis.", "That is hilarious, my mom will get a laugh out of that.

I apologize for my use of the word, and that actually makes me more upset with the nurse now.", "To be fair, the same nurse told us that, so she might have been trying to help her case, but regardless, I\u2019m sorry you all went through that!", "I have chronic pancreatitis (only 32 years old), have been hospitalised 7 times in nearly 2 years with attacks and only found out last week the cause- genetics (the rarest type out of them all). Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. The pain with pancreatitis is like no other hell out there. I'm so sorry your dad went through that. If you or your dad need some support, I'm happy to be a listening ear.", "I am so sorry that happened to him!", "Oh yeah I definitely wasn\u2019t trying to admonish you for saying it! Just that the nurse was really showing their ass.", "My mom even asked for red jello if they had it, she is not a confrontational person and does not like to make demands, especially with health care workers because she understands how hard it is, but red jello is also her favorite XD and the nurse told her she will get what she grabs and she can deal with it. Mom got orange and neighbor got red, then got mad when neighbor offered to switch. We are glad that nurse didn't last long with her"]}
