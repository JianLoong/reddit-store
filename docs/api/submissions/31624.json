They need some discipline NOW, because it's only going to get worse. I suggest you and your siblings still living at home make your personal space \"off limits\" to them and enforce this by installing locks that need a key to open.", "NTA Spoiled children are the worst! \n\nBut reading this post without paragraph breaks was pretty rough too.", "YTA, sorry. \n\nShort explanation why: though I understand and sympathize with your emotional reaction, you were disrespectful to the kids and that's not ok, especially if you do it to criticize that they are being disrespectful. After all respectful behavior is not just for kids and kids will learn much more from the ways you behave than the things you say. So not only did you insult the kids, you also set a bad example, sorry. But hey, we're all humans and none of us are never ever an AH, so don't sweat it ;)\n\nLong explanation: I understand that you feel your sister isn't parenting her children right. I will even say that you have the right to communicate to your sister how you feel children should be parented, though I also wanna stress that just bc you think this or that way is the right way doesn't make it a fact and since you don't have children of your own you can't possibly know what it's like to be a parent. But my main criticism is the way you communicated bc unlike what you may think, you actually didn't just give an opinion, you were disrespectful. If you have valid criticism then voice it in a constructive manner at an appropriate time and be specific. Don't say \"punish the kids\", explain what you mean and why you think that this is the course of action that will benefit the kids the most, bc that's really the only metric that matters in rearing kids, whether or not it's good for them. Explain why you think that being told not is good, why you think long screen times are bad, why you think kids should be submissive etc... You didn't do that here and bc you didn't the context of the situation doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how many times you swallowed your anger or didn't say anything bc those are \"actions\" that by the very fact that you didn't do them, wouldn't have been noticed by anyone. You also didn't opt for what I would consider a good parental response, like telling the kids that that was hurtful and that you're sad that they'd wanna hurt you (trust me words like these are powerful!). \n\nPunishing isn't good parenting, since it has been shown to mostly result in the kids dislike the punisher rather than be an effective way of implementing certain behaviors. Kids will not implement the behavior bc they understand why it's good but bc they fear punishment and it means that they fear you and will try to avoid you and if they think that they won't get caught then they may exhibit the behavior again bc they actually never internalized the reasons why it's bad. And also I think teaching kids to obey every adult can be dangerous bc it makes them easy pray for all sorts of abuse, even then as an adult, bc they don't learn that it's ok to stand up for themselves. Now, kids also should be taught to be kind to others and your sister's kids clearly aren't but that's not gonna change if you demonstrate unkind behavior towards them. \n\nYour sister is right in one thing after all, and that's that they are just kids. They're not no blame for not being parented and it doesn't matter how they behave. \\*Your\\* actions are always still \\*your\\* actions and aren't justified just bc \\*they\\* misbehaved. This is especially true since you're an adult, who should be better able to regulate their emotions and behaviors than a child will. Therefore, especially if you're gonna criticize them for the way they speak to the rest of the family, you have to be a role model here. It's like when parents hit their kids for hitting other kids. It just isn't consistent and will not teach the kid the right lesson. And yes, if you are gonna criticize the way the kids get parented than you have to behave consistently with good parenting yourself, I'm afraid. Can't criticize your sister for something you're not willing to do yourself (not that I'm saying you aren't).  Don't get me wrong: I'm not judging you bc I understand that we all get angry and behave like AHs sometimes. That's just human. We make mistakes and behave in bad ways, but if you ask then yeah, this is one of those times you were the AH.\n\nAlso, just as a side note: I noticed that you never once mentioned the father even though you say she's married. Why isn't he doing anything? Why are you only talking about her?  It's not solely the mother's job to parent children, so do not forget about the father!", "NTA.  Someone needed to be blunt but it may be too late and your family may have two sociopaths on its hands.", "INFO: Could the kids hear what you said when you called them that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: NTA - They didn't hear but your sister needed to", "NTA\n\nyour sister is an AH for not parenting her little brats properly", "Yikes, your sister is in for a rude awakening with those two if she thinks any of that behavior is because they are small and not a lack of parenting, the kids run the house.", "YTA only because spawn of the devil would imply it isn't your sister's fault. \n\nThey weren't born or spawned like this.  She has failed to parent them.", "It sounds like your sister is much less strict with her kids than your parents were with either of you.\n\nYou are  N T A for being angry with your sister's kids for doing stuff  that's annoying.  \n\n\n>My niece has a problem for stealing. If she sees something she likes she will take it and on one occasion I found her in my room looking through my drawers picking out clothes and had a handful of my old stuffed teddies, when I softly explained to her that she couldn\u2019t do that she ran off and my sister got mad at me for \u2018punishing\u2019 her. \n\nThe girl is FIVE. Sure, she shouldn't be in your room and looking through your things, but claiming that means she has a \"problem with stealing\" is just so much BS? And honestly, OP, I don't actually believe you when you say you \"softly explained\" she  couldn't do that.  \n\nI'm going with very soft YTA.  To me it sounds like you were brought up strictly and your sister is moving away from this. I bet you heard \"devil spawn\" from your parents when you did normal kid things like running around and yelling and saying when you didn't like the food. Good to know your sister's kids \"talk back\" to their grandparents. Maybe you should try doing that too. Plus - you have to know that calling a mom's kids \"devil spawn\" and saying they should be \"punished\" for doing things like:  \n\n\n>when my \\[8 yeart old boy\\] and \\[5 year old girl\\] were jumping around in my younger sisters room and yelling at her, I walked into the room to ask what was going on and they looked at me and said \u201cwe don\u2019t love you you aren\u2019t our mum\u201d which genuinely hurt me so when I told my sister she said to let them be and that they don\u2019t mean it. From the corner of my eye I saw my \\[5 year old niece\\] standing there with a grin on her face and she ran off leaving me hurt and angry.  \n\n\nyou have to know that's not going to mend the situation. They weren't jumping around in your room and yelling at you. They just pointed out to you in standard kid fashion that you are their aunt, their moderately annoying no-fun aunt, and it's not your business to stop the, having harmless fun.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Sister sounds like the worst kind of indulgent parent. At some point those kids will need to learn respect and how to act in the real world.
