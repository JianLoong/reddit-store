My nephew is has a knack for picking on his sister especially when he has a friend over which leads to my niece crying and seeking comfort which is understandable but she retaliates by acting out. \n\nWhenever they visit the house they will run around and cause a mess yelling and screaming, they refuse to eat the food my parents make if they don\u2019t want it and will talk back to my parents with no hesitation.

From the corner of my eye I saw my niece standing there with a grin on her face and she ran off leaving me hurt and angry.\n \nI don\u2019t know what came over me but I let out everything that I had kept bottled up saying things that my family never dared to say and finished it by saying \u201cyour kids are the devil spawn and I suggest you start punishing them for how they act\u201d and left to my room where I\u2019m currently typing this out so reddit AITA? Because in the moment I didn\u2019t think I was but sitting here I\u2019m starting to feel like I am.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: hey there everyone I know it was posted not that long ago but I have an update for you! (I live in Australia) \n\nMy sister came over this morning to talk to me. But instead of it being a conversation it was more of her yelling at me for disrespecting her kids\u2026. I sat and listened for what felt like hours of screaming and once she finished she told me to \u201cgrow up\u201d and that \u201cmy kids are good kids\u201d. \n\nWhen I heard that it was like a wave of anger washed over me and I honestly told her that her kids don\u2019t respect me, the family or the house. The family prides themselves on respecting each other but she has failed to teach them respect and manners and that I shouldn\u2019t open my door to see my niece stealing from me. I apologised for the wording I used to refer to the kids but reiterated that if it wasn\u2019t going to be me to tell her the truth then it would be someone else. \n\nMy sister looked at me and said \u201cyou\u2019re not a mother so you can\u2019t judge my parenting\u201d which is true but I had to tell her that even though I\u2019m not a mother I can\u2019t just sit aside and watch my niece and nephew grow up to be disrespectful people because if they\u2019re willing to be rude and mean toward their own family then what\u2019s going to happen to them when they enter the real world or go to school everyday? I can\u2019t help but worry for my niece and nephew because they are getting worse and I don\u2019t want to just do nothing and that she (my sister) needs to be held accountable for her actions as well as her husband. \n\nI reminded her that if she was only here to yell at me then that shows me where the children got their disrespectful attitude from and I suggest that she tried new tactics like teaching them that stealing is wrong and to do things like limit screen time and learn to say NO to them. She looked at me with disgust and left. The entire family is on my side in the situation and have commended me on telling my sister what they\u2019ve all been wanting to say but I feel like my sister will never listen nor change especially her children.\n", "created_utc": 1700827513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182qnnk/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_kids_are_the_devil/", "score": 2606, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They need some discipline NOW, because it's only going to get worse. I suggest you and your siblings still living at home make your personal space \"off limits\" to them and enforce this by installing locks that need a key to open.", "NTA Spoiled children are the worst! \n\nBut reading this post without paragraph breaks was pretty rough too.", "YTA, sorry. \n\nShort explanation why: though I understand and sympathize with your emotional reaction, you were disrespectful to the kids and that's not ok, especially if you do it to criticize that they are being disrespectful. After all respectful behavior is not just for kids and kids will learn much more from the ways you behave than the things you say. So not only did you insult the kids, you also set a bad example, sorry. But hey, we're all humans and none of us are never ever an AH, so don't sweat it ;)\n\nLong explanation: I understand that you feel your sister isn't parenting her children right. I will even say that you have the right to communicate to your sister how you feel children should be parented, though I also wanna stress that just bc you think this or that way is the right way doesn't make it a fact and since you don't have children of your own you can't possibly know what it's like to be a parent. But my main criticism is the way you communicated bc unlike what you may think, you actually didn't just give an opinion, you were disrespectful. If you have valid criticism then voice it in a constructive manner at an appropriate time and be specific. Don't say \"punish the kids\", explain what you mean and why you think that this is the course of action that will benefit the kids the most, bc that's really the only metric that matters in rearing kids, whether or not it's good for them. Explain why you think that being told not is good, why you think long screen times are bad, why you think kids should be submissive etc... You didn't do that here and bc you didn't the context of the situation doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how many times you swallowed your anger or didn't say anything bc those are \"actions\" that by the very fact that you didn't do them, wouldn't have been noticed by anyone. You also didn't opt for what I would consider a good parental response, like telling the kids that that was hurtful and that you're sad that they'd wanna hurt you (trust me words like these are powerful!). \n\nPunishing isn't good parenting, since it has been shown to mostly result in the kids dislike the punisher rather than be an effective way of implementing certain behaviors. Kids will not implement the behavior bc they understand why it's good but bc they fear punishment and it means that they fear you and will try to avoid you and if they think that they won't get caught then they may exhibit the behavior again bc they actually never internalized the reasons why it's bad. And also I think teaching kids to obey every adult can be dangerous bc it makes them easy pray for all sorts of abuse, even then as an adult, bc they don't learn that it's ok to stand up for themselves. Now, kids also should be taught to be kind to others and your sister's kids clearly aren't but that's not gonna change if you demonstrate unkind behavior towards them. \n\nYour sister is right in one thing after all, and that's that they are just kids. They're not no blame for not being parented and it doesn't matter how they behave. \\*Your\\* actions are always still \\*your\\* actions and aren't justified just bc \\*they\\* misbehaved. This is especially true since you're an adult, who should be better able to regulate their emotions and behaviors than a child will. Therefore, especially if you're gonna criticize them for the way they speak to the rest of the family, you have to be a role model here. It's like when parents hit their kids for hitting other kids. It just isn't consistent and will not teach the kid the right lesson. And yes, if you are gonna criticize the way the kids get parented than you have to behave consistently with good parenting yourself, I'm afraid. Can't criticize your sister for something you're not willing to do yourself (not that I'm saying you aren't).  Don't get me wrong: I'm not judging you bc I understand that we all get angry and behave like AHs sometimes. That's just human. We make mistakes and behave in bad ways, but if you ask then yeah, this is one of those times you were the AH.\n\nAlso, just as a side note: I noticed that you never once mentioned the father even though you say she's married. Why isn't he doing anything? Why are you only talking about her?  It's not solely the mother's job to parent children, so do not forget about the father!", "NTA.

Sure, she shouldn't be in your room and looking through your things, but claiming that means she has a \"problem with stealing\" is just so much BS? And honestly, OP, I don't actually believe you when you say you \"softly explained\" she  couldn't do that.  \n\nI'm going with very soft YTA.  To me it sounds like you were brought up strictly and your sister is moving away from this. I bet you heard \"devil spawn\" from your parents when you did normal kid things like running around and yelling and saying when you didn't like the food.

It is important to remember that this is not the children's fault, it is your sister's fault.

She seems to not be teaching any boundaries at all which is just horrible.
