They need some discipline NOW, because it's only going to get worse. I suggest you and your siblings still living at home make your personal space \"off limits\" to them and enforce this by installing locks that need a key to open.", "NTA Spoiled children are the worst! \n\nBut reading this post without paragraph breaks was pretty rough too.", "YTA, sorry. \n\nShort explanation why: though I understand and sympathize with your emotional reaction, you were disrespectful to the kids and that's not ok, especially if you do it to criticize that they are being disrespectful. After all respectful behavior is not just for kids and kids will learn much more from the ways you behave than the things you say. So not only did you insult the kids, you also set a bad example, sorry. But hey, we're all humans and none of us are never ever an AH, so don't sweat it ;)\n\nLong explanation: I understand that you feel your sister isn't parenting her children right. I will even say that you have the right to communicate to your sister how you feel children should be parented, though I also wanna stress that just bc you think this or that way is the right way doesn't make it a fact and since you don't have children of your own you can't possibly know what it's like to be a parent. But my main criticism is the way you communicated bc unlike what you may think, you actually didn't just give an opinion, you were disrespectful. If you have valid criticism then voice it in a constructive manner at an appropriate time and be specific. Don't say \"punish the kids\", explain what you mean and why you think that this is the course of action that will benefit the kids the most, bc that's really the only metric that matters in rearing kids, whether or not it's good for them. Explain why you think that being told not is good, why you think long screen times are bad, why you think kids should be submissive etc... You didn't do that here and bc you didn't the context of the situation doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how many times you swallowed your anger or didn't say anything bc those are \"actions\" that by the very fact that you didn't do them, wouldn't have been noticed by anyone. You also didn't opt for what I would consider a good parental response, like telling the kids that that was hurtful and that you're sad that they'd wanna hurt you (trust me words like these are powerful!). \n\nPunishing isn't good parenting, since it has been shown to mostly result in the kids dislike the punisher rather than be an effective way of implementing certain behaviors. Kids will not implement the behavior bc they understand why it's good but bc they fear punishment and it means that they fear you and will try to avoid you and if they think that they won't get caught then they may exhibit the behavior again bc they actually never internalized the reasons why it's bad. And also I think teaching kids to obey every adult can be dangerous bc it makes them easy pray for all sorts of abuse, even then as an adult, bc they don't learn that it's ok to stand up for themselves. Now, kids also should be taught to be kind to others and your sister's kids clearly aren't but that's not gonna change if you demonstrate unkind behavior towards them. \n\nYour sister is right in one thing after all, and that's that they are just kids. They're not no blame for not being parented and it doesn't matter how they behave. \\*Your\\* actions are always still \\*your\\* actions and aren't justified just bc \\*they\\* misbehaved. This is especially true since you're an adult, who should be better able to regulate their emotions and behaviors than a child will. Therefore, especially if you're gonna criticize them for the way they speak to the rest of the family, you have to be a role model here. It's like when parents hit their kids for hitting other kids. It just isn't consistent and will not teach the kid the right lesson. And yes, if you are gonna criticize the way the kids get parented than you have to behave consistently with good parenting yourself, I'm afraid. Can't criticize your sister for something you're not willing to do yourself (not that I'm saying you aren't).  Don't get me wrong: I'm not judging you bc I understand that we all get angry and behave like AHs sometimes. That's just human. We make mistakes and behave in bad ways, but if you ask then yeah, this is one of those times you were the AH.\n\nAlso, just as a side note: I noticed that you never once mentioned the father even though you say she's married. Why isn't he doing anything? Why are you only talking about her?  It's not solely the mother's job to parent children, so do not forget about the father!", "NTA.

If she sees something she likes she will take it and on one occasion I found her in my room looking through my drawers picking out clothes and had a handful of my old stuffed teddies, when I softly explained to her that she couldn\u2019t do that she ran off and my sister got mad at me for \u2018punishing\u2019 her. \n\nThe girl is FIVE. Sure, she shouldn't be in your room and looking through your things, but claiming that means she has a \"problem with stealing\" is just so much BS? And honestly, OP, I don't actually believe you when you say you \"softly explained\" she  couldn't do that.  \n\nI'm going with very soft YTA.  To me it sounds like you were brought up strictly and your sister is moving away from this. I bet you heard \"devil spawn\" from your parents when you did normal kid things like running around and yelling and saying when you didn't like the food. Good to know your sister's kids \"talk back\" to their grandparents. Maybe you should try doing that too.

It is the responsibility of the people who care for these children to teach them boundaries and direct their behaviour into better directions. You are not an asshole though, you are tired and upset with the children's unacceptable behaviour and disrespect and it became overwhelming for you, which is understandable. It is important to remember that this is not the children's fault, it is your sister's fault. Your sister is right that you shouldn't get mad at or yell at children, however that DOES NOT MEAN that you shouldn't teach them boundaries and enforce them. She seems to not be teaching any boundaries at all which is just horrible. YOU on the other hand are in full right to set boundaries for yourself and your property as an adult in these children's lives. If your sister isn't going to teach them, then it is all the more important that other adults in the children's lives do.

And that no can come from anyone. \n\nIt\u2019s necessary that they learn the concept \u201cpersonal boundaries \u201c and \u201cprivacy\u201d. As another comment said: it\u2019s only going to get worse. I wouldn\u2019t wonder if no one wants tk help her out with them when she needs a babysitter.", "Thanks for the advice I\u2019ll be sure to use it :)", "Nta", "Well when it runs out of charge what else are they gonna do?", "Yeah, the whole thing reads fake. Also a 5yo going through her clothes? I doubt that a lot.", "I was thinking the exact same thing.", "Oh and on the subject of \u201cdevil spawn\u201d\u2026 yeah I would recommend not using that language again; try to be more constructive since you seem to be the only responsible adult here. But don\u2019t feel too bad; strong language spills out from time to time when people push us beyond our breaking points.", "Have fun in jail!", "Hey there! thank you for the comment I appreciate it a lot. I admit that I did criticise my sister for her parenting but I did also tell her about limiting screen time and teaching them how to treat other like they\u2019d want to be treated. I grew up in a household where respect and manners were of upmost importance so have never spoken down or raised my voice at anyone. This situation however, I let my feelings get the best of me and I let out all of the pent up annoyance I have kept bottled up over the years which wasn\u2019t responsible I\u2019ll admit. \n\nAlso My sisters husband doesn\u2019t care for how they act at all and encourages them like my sister too.", "So what you're saying is, next time he should punch the little shits in the face?", "Well, that\u2019s not true is it? The honour system only works if people care to be honourable. Your nephew and niece couldn\u2019t care less about your personal space and are trampling over your boundaries. Not getting locks at this stage is simply enabling them. I suggest you fit a lock and only use it when they are around. Your parents would be wise to do the same, especially if they keep anything valuable or private in their rooms that the little thieves might find. \n\nNTA. If your sister doesn\u2019t start disciplining them soon, they\u2019re in for some nasty shocks in life.", "If you\u2019re contemplating door locks because a child every adult refuses to discipline steals your stuff, your family does not respect others\u2019 space and has nothing to be proud of, sorry.", "Your parents need to foot the bill for any items your sister's hellions steal or destroy then, since they won't allow you to protect your own property and space with the most basic barrier to unauthorized entry, and you obviously cannot stay in your room to guard your things the whole time the brats are there.", ">I appreciate the comment :) unfortunately locks on our doors aren\u2019t allowed in my house as our family takes pride in respecting each others space so we don\u2019t believe in locks on doors.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>My niece has a problem for stealing. If she sees something she likes she will take it", "Well apparently the memo didn't reach your sisters kids, so in that light you may want to reevaluate that policy.", "Fucking bullshit, they let the little ones steal from you.", "Your immediate family might respect that but your niece and nephew don't.\n\nGet locks for your doors even if you only use them when your sisters kids are around.", "Yet your niece and nephew don\u2019t have to follow that rule when they are around? They disrespect your spaces all the time by stealing from you and being nasty to you and your siblings in your rooms! Your parents are hypocrites if they continue to enforce the no locks rule while also allowing these kids to run amok in the house.", "They need to start allowing locks in your home, even if it\u2019s just for the times those kids come over.", "But clearly your sister isn't teaching her kids about privacy, respect or personal space", "Edit: I can\u2019t read ignore this", "But your sister's kids don't respect personal space!", "Obviously they don\u2019t respect your space or else this wouldn\u2019t have boiled over the way it did.", "You understand that's an oxymoron thing to say. Cause clearly they don't.", "Well point out to your parents that your sister is not teaching her kids to respect other people's space. That the locks are not for people living in the house but to keep out your niblings.", "Maybe not their creativity (thinking of minecraft creative mode) depending on what they're doing, but yeah definitely their attention span", "Good luck.  I hope your parents can help you sort it out.  It isn't your responsibility!  But hopefully you can come to a solution together.", "That's too bad, sounds like they need to hear it.", "No, don't listen to that comment, it was an apt description. they sure as hell aren't angels.", "You should have been harsher.  They are feral animals and should be on leashes.", ">and are very kind and loving people who would never call people especially children insulting words.\n\nSo - you picked up \"devil spawn\" from WHERE? Who taught you it was okay to call children insulting words and accuse a little kid of having a \"problem with stealing\"?", "After the situation with my niece in my room my parents and I talked about it and decided it would be best to put a little barrier in front of my bedroom door  whenever they visit and take it down when they leave :)", ">if they keep anything valuable or private \n\nAs soon as one of the devils comes into the living room with grandma's \"massager\", locks will go in super-fast.", "\ud83c\udfb6one of these things, doesn't belong\ud83c\udfb6", "Dude the problem with stealing isn't that deep, if a kid keeps stealing there's clearly a problem there with them either unable to deal with impulse control or they're not being taught that's wrong. That IS a problem. And OP is 18 not 8, they can learn words without their parenting having taught them it. Devil spawn is used in popular media and books, it's not that deep and you're wildly reaching for a way to discredit an OP that has been nothing but polite in the comments. A single moment of anger where they used a very mild insult does not an arsehole make. The kids didn't hear. They didn't call them that to their face and stronger language might be the only thing to get through to the sister who is massively letting down her bairns. \n\nFeels like you're desperate for a reason to be mad here. Problem with stealing isn't an insult or a diagnosis or anything, it's a seemingly true statement and trying to act like OP lied about her parents because she used a mild insult is bonkers.", "Your niece has no qualms with outright stealing from you, you really think a little barrier will stop them?", "You realize that you're not required to love shitty children even if they're related to you, right?", "> put a little barrier in front of my bedroom door\n\nThat's basically lock territory.\n\nYour parents seem semi-reasonable. Talk to them about an actual lock, and maybe suggest they get them for the other bedrooms too. Let them know that you have no plans on locking it when sister/spawn are not there. Your sister's kids don't take  \"pride in respecting each others space\" so the old paradigm no longer works.\n\nThe other option is that your parents sit down sister/spawn and tell them which rooms are off limits, and if found there they **will be leaving immediately**.", "The barrier will only be seen as an opportunity to cause more drama. A lock is the best way to go, but be sure your parents are willing to enforce the preservation of your privacy. Your sister is going to be pressured by her children and will cave in quickly to their demands. The following hissy fit will be epic. If your parents don\u2019t support you all the way, nothing you own will be safe.", "Or booby trap it. I'm a little bit evil so I have LOTS of inventive ways to deal with thieves, most of which will get me put off of Reddit. One of my clients that is a disabled veteran (professional organizer) kept having people come to his windows and either trying to break in or just being assholes, so I came up with a nice little invention to put on the ground outside his windows and back door at night.....\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 I think it solved his problem.", "This made me laugh in a very evil way.", ">The kids didn't hear.

She didn't like it that a five-year-old kid was smiling when her mom told her 18-year-old aunt not to interfere.   \n\n\nAnd no, a five-year-old who takes things without asking is not \"devil spawn\".

Not \"little barriers\", not door wedges. *Locks*. Tell them that it's time for them to show the \"respect\" that *you* deserve by allowing you control over who enters your room at all times.", "Half-measures aren't going to work.\n\nIt will be taken as a challenge by the kids and an excuse for more drama by the sister.\n\nGet locks installed and just deal with the drama once instead of suffering dribs and drabs by taking ineffective measures that don't work.\n\nNTA."]}
