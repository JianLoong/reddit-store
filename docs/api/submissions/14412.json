I\u2019m assuming your son is well into adulthood here which factors into my judgement. He wasn\u2019t wrong to be curious, and It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s upset at the moment.

Sure. But your son is an adult struggling with trying to make the same decision you made and honestly it does a disservice to him if you lie, or softball it too much.

He asked a question and you answered it honestly while still making sure to let him know that you DO love him. I'm sure his feelings are a bit hurt but you didn't lie and that's important because you also said his problems at home stem from discussions about children. He should hear all different types of parental views of he's trying to decide if he wants children.

The fact that they deserve to exist should never be a question in their minds.

He didn't want to be your therapist listening to your traumas and issues. He needed to hear that he is loved, and how his fears about parenting relate to reality in general. That's all.", "YTA for the way you explained this. You told your son you didn\u2019t want to get pregnant with him & you told him that you thought about giving up custody of him after he was several years old. I have known several people whose parents told them that they didn\u2019t want them to be born, and none of them were ever okay with it. Some felt guilty for existing & ruining their parents\u2019 lives. Others focused on every parenting mistake as more proof that their parents never wanted or cared about them. It is possible to tell your kids difficult truths about being a young parent without telling them they were unwanted or that they were so difficult as teens that you regretted having them. In dark times, like when they\u2019re fighting with a spouse over a difficult issue, many people cling to the idea that even if they lose the marriage, their parents always love them.

He has asked many questions and I have been honest with him about my hesitations and the reasons behind it. \n\nHe wants to be a father and after seeing the difference it made in his life when I remarried and was able to stay at home with him, he wants to have a career which would allow his future wife to stay at home with their children. He also understands the importance of a retirement account for his future wife and giving her time for herself too. \n\nOp, you\u2019re nta because our sons need to hear from us how motherhood affected us so they can prepare and hopefully understand how to support the women in their lives who become the mothers of their children. \n\nIf we are not honest with them, who will be?", "NTA\n \nYour son is probably reflecting on a lot.", "YTA.\n\n\nI don't care what the situation is, you cannot say the words \"I regretted having you\" to your own child and expect them to be unhurt. \n\n\nI don't care that he asked.

You regretting your son's existence is not a teachable moment for YOUR SON. You have permanently altered his world. He will never look at you or his life the same way again. \n\n\nMy heart aches for your son.

Been in my stepkids life over a decade.\n\nA while ago I had a miscarriage a few months in. We thankfully waited to announce due to my health issues coupled with my MIL's cancer flaring up during that point. It broke me pretty bad. My SO not so much because he admittedly already had a kid. And he only had that one because his ex lied about being on birth control. He wasn't much for children.\n\nMy SO was willing to try for a baby again with me but I decided to wait and I'm kind of relieved I did. My stepkid was smooth sailing until more recently. Hit puberty and suddenly snapped. Refusal to bathe. Threatening texts to peers. Physical fights. Uncontrolled rage. And I've feared for my own safety more than once.  We've gotten them into therapy but it's been HARD.\n\nI feel way too relieved about not having my own kid now. And that makes me almost feel bad.

I never really knew her mother, but from everything I\u2019ve heard about her, she would have felt exactly the same although it was the late 1930s/early 40s and she didn\u2019t really have any other choices either. I\u2019ve never had difficulty understanding that my mother loves her kids very much but the fact that she had us changed her life and career path in some ways she really hated. \n\nI\u2019m sure the news was a shock to your son if he hadn\u2019t suspected it all along, but after some time to get used to it, he really should be able to handle it fine.

You lose all your free time, an obscene amount of money, you have physical and hormonal ramifications for your whole life (both parents if you're an actual involved dad who also loses sleep), and many of your friends will move on and abandon you. You will be sick every other week if you choose daycare, you will have to choose between work and keeping your child feeling safe and loved while they are sick. You gain more stress and anxiety than you even could have imagined. And that's with a fully functional child with no disabilities. \n\nAnd to some, it's worth it, SO worth it. On every level.

You have infinite patience even with every problem and ramification because that's your baby and it smiled at you and it's learning and it's happy and holy shit, nothing can compare. \n\nBut to many? It's not. And they don't understand that it's going to be hard when they ask around and people are like \"oh, teehee, it's hard, but so worth it! It was amazing!\" NO.

But truly, sometimes people (especially women, regrettably) react like I'm the worst mother ever by saying these things! As if I don't love him if I say one negative thing about parenthood.

I was traumatised. I had *zero* pain relief because I (foolishly) assumed that's how it was supposed to be as a first time mum... trust your body and all that shebang. Well, during contractions and hanging off of my incredible husband I *dislocated his damn shoulder.* My mother was in the room with me just telling me to breathe the gas which was doing sweet fuck all except make me feel sick, and my husband stood there helplessly with his arm half hanging, doing everything he could.  \n\n\nMy labour was short, less than 4 hours.

Not tell your child that their last remaining parent is low-key resentful of your existence and that they 'ruined' your body and were a 'difficult' teenager when their freaking dad had died! Maybe he was difficult because he was a grieving child and you were resentful of being a mother. There are ways to get across how hard and life-changing being a parent is, and how yeah it's not for everyone.

You really don't have to.\"  And she expressed her feelings about how, when she had me she'd been struggling with her fertility for years, when she got pregnant she was like 1/2way through the process of an adoption, I was a much much much wanted baby.  And raising me was so incredibly difficult sometimes, and she felt she had nobody she could turn to because everybody just wanted to talk about how lucky she was that the fertility treatments finally took, and she just had to act like she was so happy and grateful all the time.  I don't know, I didn't feel hurt at all that raising me was hard for her, or even the idea that she might have regretted it.  I know my mom loves me.  My mom's behavior through my decades of life have made it completely obvious that my mom loves me.  But hearing that was a hard pill for me to swallow.  Hearing that was what made me shut the door forever on the idea of having kids, and that was a really really hard thing.\n\nAnd I'm so incredibly grateful that she gave that to me.  She gave me my life as I know it today.  She gave me disposable income and free time and travel and keeping my body exactly the way it is.  She gave me a huge gift.

There shouldn\u2019t be shame about recognizing that the parenting career isn\u2019t for you, because it\u2019s extraordinarily taxing.

That seems a little manipulative. If his wife is saying that she wants children for nine years and changed his mind that is a big thing. Some people really want to be a parent and If any of them giving in to the other the resentment would likely Poison the relationship. I think YTA- because you could have said your opinion without pratically saying that you had your child for hold down a man and was thinking about giving up custody of him and that you reggreted having him a Lot of times because he was a \"dificult\" thing.

If that\u2019s the case, your trauma is valid, but it\u2019s abundantly clear that it\u2019s making it so you can\u2019t look outside your own hurt on this situation, hence your projection and your assertion in this comment that OP is \u201clying about loving her son.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your (presumed) hurt, but not every scenario that has some similarities to yours will be identical to yours.
