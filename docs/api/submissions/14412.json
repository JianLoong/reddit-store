People who aren't parents have a hard time understanding that mixed feeling of loving your child more than anything while simultaneously regretting having kids. \n\nHe (or his wife) may very well have the same feelings in the future but not realize that they aren't alone, and that having those feelings doesn't make you a bad parent.

He may have not realised how much it really affected you. How much you sheltered him from the moments of regret and negativity you felt at times.\n\nI would just give him time, maybe he just didn't realise quite how much it could and would affect his wife's life and why she might want to wait.

What could you have done, lied? Well that\u2019d definitely be an AH move. Softened the blow? Even that wouldn\u2019t have been right, to your adult son, looking to you for life advice.

It seems that he wants kids and his wife is uncertain, hence their fighting. A maybe isn\u2019t and should never be a yes when it comes to children.

I\u2019m assuming your son is well into adulthood here which factors into my judgement. He wasn\u2019t wrong to be curious, and It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s upset at the moment. That still doesn\u2019t make you an AH for having a truthful/earnest discussion regarding your own struggles as a parent. This is a sensitive topic but you handled it well imo, you weren\u2019t harsh at all with what you said. He pried for information and you were clear about you went through while reiterating your love for him. A lot of people go into parenthood uniformed and unprepared for the hard reality.

Sure. But your son is an adult struggling with the trying to make the same decision you made and honestly it does a disservice to him if you lie, or softball it too much.

He asked a question and you answered it honestly while still making sure to let him know that you DO love him. I'm sure his feelings are a bit hurt but you didn't lie and that's important because you also said his problems at home stem from discussions about children. He should hear all different types of parental views of he's trying to decide if he wants children. Not everyone has 100% positive experiences with parenthood and he should know that some WOULD make a different choice, if given the chance, so he at least considers all angles before making up his mind.", "NTA - i suspect he and his wife argued about having children.

This is a secret only revealed after women get pregnant !! does he know about calcium? how the organs move? how pregnancy affest her digestive system?

My dad really wasn't all that excited about the idea of having another kid to pay for. He was even a little hopeful that she would choose not to continue the pregnancy. He never once tried convincing her because he knew that it wasn't his choice to make. My first reaction was, \"Ouch.\" (I wans't even being serious when I said that) I am a parent, though, so I understand. Apparently, he changed his mind the very second he laid eyes on me. I love my son more than anything else in the whole world, but sometimes I wonder what choices I would have made differently had I known what kind of man his father would end up being.

Just know I always have and always will love you\".", "YTA.\n\nYou've told him, intentionally or not that he's ruined your life, your body, you didn't want him. \n\nI would ask how you'd feel if that happened to you, but, it'll come to you soon enough", "YTA.  Not all truths need to be spoken aloud. You hurt him deeply for no real purpose other than to unburden yourself at his expense.", "Holy shit, yes YTA. Imagine if your mom said that to you. Congrats, your son is now burdened with being not wanted.", "YTA. You can talk about how hard parenting is to your (now grown) kid so as to give him advice regarding his own kids and when to have them, but NEVER. make. your. child. feel like you resent them, regret having them, or would choose not to have them if you could go back. The fact that they deserve to exist should never be a question in their minds. Yes, it sounds like you had a rough go losing your child's father and having struggles thereafter, but that is in 0% way your child's fault.

You told him dealing with him as a person was a deal breaker for you.\n\nImagine how you would feel if someone told you that and then turned around with claiming to love you with all their heart.\n\nYour son isn't going to tell you he's hurt. He shouldn't have to in this instance. He didn't tell your boyfriend and your boyfriend was able to pick it up without issue.", "YTA.

However, it\u2019s not his fault you had to be convinced to have him. It\u2019s not his fault he changed your life in some difficult ways. You made a conscious decision to become a parent. Again, I don\u2019t think you were wrong for being truthful with your son about the hardships of parenthood, but there was probably a better way to convey that that didn\u2019t make him feel like you could either take him or leave him.", "Yta", "Well you probably managed to mess you all's relationship permanently by giving more detail than was necessary. YTA for the added details.", "YTA- You could have expressed how hard parenthood is without straight up telling him you wished he hasn\u2019t been born", "YTA\n\nTo put it bluntly, your son wanted to talk about him. He didn't want to be your therapist listening to your traumas and issues. He needed to hear that he is loved, and how his fears about parenting relate to reality in general. That's all.", "YTA for the way you explained this. You told your son you didn\u2019t want to get pregnant with him & you told him that you thought about giving up custody of him after he was several years old. I have known several people whose parents told them that they didn\u2019t want them to be born, and none of them were ever okay with it. Some felt guilty for existing & ruining their parents\u2019 lives. Others focused on every parenting mistake as more proof that their parents never wanted or cared about them. It is possible to tell your kids difficult truths about being a young parent without telling them they were unwanted or that they were so difficult as teens that you regretted having them. In dark times, like when they\u2019re fighting with a spouse over a difficult issue, many people cling to the idea that even if they lose the marriage, their parents always love them.
