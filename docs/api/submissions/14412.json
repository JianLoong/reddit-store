How much you sheltered him from the moments of regret and negativity you felt at times.\n\nI would just give him time, maybe he just didn't realise quite how much it could and would affect his wife's life and why she might want to wait.

I\u2019m assuming your son is well into adulthood here which factors into my judgement. He wasn\u2019t wrong to be curious, and It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s upset at the moment. That still doesn\u2019t make you an AH for having a truthful/earnest discussion regarding your own struggles as a parent. This is a sensitive topic but you handled it well imo, you weren\u2019t harsh at all with what you said.

Sure. But your son is an adult struggling with the trying to make the same decision you made and honestly it does a disservice to him if you lie, or softball it too much.

He asked a question and you answered it honestly while still making sure to let him know that you DO love him. I'm sure his feelings are a bit hurt but you didn't lie and that's important because you also said his problems at home stem from discussions about children. He should hear all different types of parental views of he's trying to decide if he wants children.

He never once tried convincing her because he knew that it wasn't his choice to make. My first reaction was, \"Ouch.\" (I wans't even being serious when I said that) I am a parent, though, so I understand. Apparently, he changed his mind the very second he laid eyes on me. I love my son more than anything else in the whole world, but sometimes I wonder what choices I would have made differently had I known what kind of man his father would end up being.

Not all truths need to be spoken aloud. You hurt him deeply for no real purpose other than to unburden yourself at his expense.", "Holy shit, yes YTA. Imagine if your mom said that to you.

You can talk about how hard parenting is to your (now grown) kid so as to give him advice regarding his own kids and when to have them, but NEVER. make. your. child. feel like you resent them, regret having them, or would choose not to have them if you could go back. The fact that they deserve to exist should never be a question in their minds.

However, it\u2019s not his fault you had to be convinced to have him. It\u2019s not his fault he changed your life in some difficult ways. You made a conscious decision to become a parent.

YTA for the added details.", "YTA- You could have expressed how hard parenthood is without straight up telling him you wished he hasn\u2019t been born", "YTA\n\nTo put it bluntly, your son wanted to talk about him. He didn't want to be your therapist listening to your traumas and issues. He needed to hear that he is loved, and how his fears about parenting relate to reality in general. That's all.", "YTA for the way you explained this. You told your son you didn\u2019t want to get pregnant with him & you told him that you thought about giving up custody of him after he was several years old. I have known several people whose parents told them that they didn\u2019t want them to be born, and none of them were ever okay with it. Some felt guilty for existing & ruining their parents\u2019 lives. Others focused on every parenting mistake as more proof that their parents never wanted or cared about them. It is possible to tell your kids difficult truths about being a young parent without telling them they were unwanted or that they were so difficult as teens that you regretted having them. In dark times, like when they\u2019re fighting with a spouse over a difficult issue, many people cling to the idea that even if they lose the marriage, their parents always love them.

He has asked many questions and I have been honest with him about my hesitations and the reasons behind it. \n\nHe wants to be a father and after seeing the difference it made in his life when I remarried and was able to stay at home with him, he wants to have a career which would allow his future wife to stay at home with their children. He also understands the importance of a retirement account for his future wife and giving her time for herself too. \n\nOp, you\u2019re nta because our sons need to hear from us how motherhood affected us so they can prepare and hopefully understand how to support the women in their lives who become the mothers of their children. \n\nIf we are not honest with them, who will be?", "NTA\n \nYour son is probably reflecting on a lot.", "YTA.\n\n\nI don't care what the situation is, you cannot say the words \"I regretted having you\" to your own child and expect them to be unhurt. \n\n\nI don't care that he asked. I don't care that you were being honest. You can give advice on how hard it is to have a child without saying that. You can say nothing. You regretting your son's existence is not a teachable moment for YOUR SON. You have permanently altered his world. He will never look at you or his life the same way again. \n\n\nMy heart aches for your son. He went to someone he loved, someone he thought loved him unconditionally, and instead of having that validated he was told that one of the people he loved most in the world at one point longed for a world without him in it.", "YTA.  He wanted and needed comfort, and you basically said, \"Don't have kids because they'll just fuck up your life.\"  And BTW, he's *not* okay.", "Yep... Too blunt.. although your reasoning wad sound.\n\nSo NTA because you went through a lot but it that wasn't your brightest move in a long time....", "NTA", "NTA my mom although she will never admit it I know 100% would have preferred to never have children and all 4 of her kids were accidents. I am by no means upset by this. My mom loved me and was a good parent and I didn't realize until I became an adult she didn't want kids", "Oof. This hits home. I'm not a parent but I am a stepparent. Been in my stepkids life over a decade.\n\nA while ago I had a miscarriage a few months in. We thankfully waited to announce due to my health issues coupled with my MIL's cancer flaring up during that point. It broke me pretty bad. My SO not so much because he admittedly already had a kid. And he only had that one because his ex lied about being on birth control. He wasn't much for children.\n\nMy SO was willing to try for a baby again with me but I decided to wait and I'm kind of relieved I did. My stepkid was smooth sailing until more recently. Hit puberty and suddenly snapped. Refusal to bathe. Threatening texts to peers. Physical fights. Uncontrolled rage. And I've feared for my own safety more than once.  We've gotten them into therapy but it's been HARD.\n\nI feel way too relieved about not having my own kid now. And that makes me almost feel bad. But I'm stepkids chauffeur,  cook, and maid during our days and I really relish the days stepkid is with Bio Mom because I can be selfish and look after my needs without feeling guilty.", "This is tough because no one wants their mom to tell them that they weren't wanted.", "That still doesn\u2019t make you an AH for having a truthful/earnest discussion regarding your own struggles as a parent.", "Yea if ops son want a to limit contact its probably for the best", "Yea she could have lied and said she didn't regret having him", "She doesn't have to lie and say she loves him", "You're wrong, massively. Someone who is debating whether to have kids needs to be able to face this. Otherwise, the same thing has the potential to happen.\n\nIf this was out of the blue, or to a child, you would be right, but context matters.", "If you can, try and talk to him about how hard it is for the woman, pregnancy isn\u2019t like they show on tv. He wants to be a dad, that\u2019s great, he gets the easy job.", "Hopefully your son gets the message and leaves. That way you get what you wanted", "Then I\u2019d think she was TA. You shouldn\u2019t lie to your adult children that are asking you questions. Your children, at any age, look to parents as a place to gain wisdom and knowledge about the world and how it works. Her son is wondering if he is cut out to be a father and he needs to know the hard truths about parenting so he isn\u2019t blindsided.", " and now her son will never forget that she regrets having him and will never look at op the same again and most likely will limit contact", "All of your suppositions about these people you literally don\u2019t know, aside, he shouldn\u2019t forget that fact. As I said, he needs to know the hard truths before he becomes a parent. In my original comment, I said that I think he will eventually be grateful that she was honest with him. Yes, she sometimes regretted getting pregnant, no that doesn\u2019t make her a monster. It makes her human. And more normal than plenty of parents would care to admit. You don\u2019t need to agree with me, have a great day\ud83d\udc96", "There's no resentment. Just truths. It doesn't matter how you say it and who's \"fault\" it was. This question is so dumb. The main point is, when you have a child, the woman's body gets altered. Only *you* want to give someone the fault", "No in just live in the real world and know how actual human beings respond. She's not a monster but her son is never going to think about that every time he sees op", "Of course, I seem to have forgotten that you\u2019re the Average Redditor\u2122 and you know how all people react to all situations. We shall all bow down to our all-knowing overlord that lives in the real world /s", "Yea I'm.a actual average human being who knows that a mother telling her child she regretted having him will act have some sort of affect on that son.", "Again, you don\u2019t need to agree with me and I certainly don\u2019t agree with you. Really, just move on", "Soft NTA, but DEFINITELY could have handled the conversation better to tell him the truth without hurting his feelings. Lying would have done him no favours when he was asking and on the verge of potentially repeating history with his wife. He needed to hear how rough it was, but definitely could have done it in a way to avoid the hurt feelings.\n\nMaybe clarify you don't regret it NOW, and definitely tell him what you told us as far as not being able to imagine life without him. Just that it was a lot of hardship to get to this point and wasn't something to take lightly.", "YTA, he is never going to forget that you told him you didn't want him it will always be there in the back of his mind don't be surprised if he goes no contact", "YTA, there's no scenario where you aren't.", "NAH. I think you handled this topic with care and it doesn\u2019t serve anyone well to believe that becoming a parent is all sunshine and roses.", "NTA. Your son is an adult and this is the kind of honesty you should be able to share with him. \n\nI\u2019ve never wanted kids myself. I\u2019ve also always pretty much known that my mother wouldn\u2019t have gotten married and had kids when she did, if she\u2019d had any other examples of how to live a full and happy life in the 1960s. I never really knew her mother, but from everything I\u2019ve heard about her, she would have felt exactly the same although it was the late 1930s/early 40s and she didn\u2019t really have any other choices either. I\u2019ve never had difficulty understanding that my mother loves her kids very much but the fact that she had us changed her life and career path in some ways she really hated. \n\nI\u2019m sure the news was a shock to your son if he hadn\u2019t suspected it all along, but after some time to get used to it, he really should be able to handle it fine. I promise, it\u2019s not difficult to understand that my mom loves me *and* she would have made different choices in a do-over. People are complicated and I think we/society are wrong to pretend that parenthood is simple.", "Yeah. Don't take it the wrong way but your son needs to spend more time on the internet.\n\nA lot of parents might not choose to be parents if given the choice.", "I\u2019m not sure why you expect him to confide his feelings after you told him that he wasn\u2019t wanted\u2014even into his teens\u2014and you would have gotten rid of him had his father not died. I doubt he will want to continue being a burden to you.\n\nAnd of course he\u2019s quiet - not only is he wondering what his childhood might have been like with a mother who wanted him, but he\u2019s also considering whether to divorce his wife because of the bait-and-switch and find someone compatible.", "YTA - he didn\u2019t permanently alter your body. You and your late husband did", "He can feel how he wants about it but he is considering a huge decision and knowing your truth should help him see the bigger picture. Both parents should eagerly want a child or they shouldn\u2019t create life. \n\nIt\u2019s easy for men to want children while the patriarchy continues to rage on. They don\u2019t have to sacrifice their body, career, or take on the brunt of the childcare in most situations. You are upset he feels badly because you love him but he needs the reality check *just as much* because you love him.\n\nIt would be almost criminal to not answer truthfully", "Heavily disagree. So, so many people fuck up their lives, the lives of their spouses, and the lives of their kids because so many people bullshit them like this. \n\nPeople need to know that having kids is HARD. You lose all your free time, an obscene amount of money, you have physical and hormonal ramifications for your whole life (both parents if you're an actual involved dad who also loses sleep), and many of your friends will move on and abandon you. You will be sick every other week if you choose daycare, you will have to choose between work and keeping your child feeling safe and loved while they are sick. You gain more stress and anxiety than you even could have imagined. And that's with a fully functional child with no disabilities. \n\nAnd to some, it's worth it, SO worth it. On every level. Like, the happiness from it doesn't compare to the sad times or hard times. You have infinite patience even with every problem and ramification because that's your baby and it smiled at you and it's learning and it's happy and holy shit, nothing can compare. \n\nBut to many? It's not. And they don't understand that it's going to be hard when they ask around and people are like \"oh, teehee, it's hard, but so worth it! It was amazing!\" NO. THEY NEED DETAILS TO MAKE A CHOICE. THEY DON'T NEED \"Five stars, food was good!\" THEY NEED \"Five stars, I love spicy food and this was so spicy my mouth almost melted off! I've been looking for a place this spicy and this was it! It had back of the throat spice, nose spice, slow burn spice, it was amazing!\" \n\nNEEEEEEVER sugarcoat having a child to people. It's how you end up with people abandoning children or in wildly deep depressions. All this hiding the truth of how hard kids are is absolutely detrimental to all fucking society. Stop tricking people into having kids, for fuck's sake, let them make genuinely informed decisions.", "Completely agree! Got an eight month old and I'm telling everyone how hard it is. But truly, sometimes people (especially women, regrettably) react like I'm the worst mother ever by saying these things! As if I don't love him if I say one negative thing about parenthood. I think that's one of the reasons people don't like talking about it: the judgement and the guilt that stems from saying anything negative about your little one.", "God yes all of the above and more.  \n\n\nMy mother painted giving birth naturally as the be all and end all and when I had my first kid (induced, thanks to pregnancy complications) it was a nightmare. I was traumatised. I had *zero* pain relief because I (foolishly) assumed that's how it was supposed to be as a first time mum... trust your body and all that shebang. Well, during contractions and hanging off of my incredible husband I *dislocated his damn shoulder.* My mother was in the room with me just telling me to breathe the gas which was doing sweet fuck all except make me feel sick, and my husband stood there helplessly with his arm half hanging, doing everything he could.  \n\n\nMy labour was short, less than 4 hours. For some women labour lasts 24+ hours. Its incredibly stressful and tiring for both parents-to-be.  \n\n\nAnd then after the baby is born the real \"fun\" begins.  \n\n\nI am brutally honest with my two best friends who are both my age and kids have been a consideration of theirs for a little bit now (we're all in our mid-30s now), but I also mention to them that my situation is not the be all and end all. Some women have easy pregnancies, easy births, easy babies. I was the unlucky sod who had the trifecta of all three being absolutely awful.  \n\n\nDoes it make me love my son less? Absolutely not, he's the most amazing, intelligent (oftimes trying) and loving 7 year old that I know of, and now that I'm pregnant with twins he makes my heart melt by cuddling my belly, and whispering how much he loves them.", ">Yes, she sometimes regretted getting pregnant\n\nThat's not what she told him though, is it? She told him she didn't want him, she told him she was essentially pressured into having him, she told him she straight up thought about abandoning him when he was a child, she told him she regretted having him. That's a whole lot of \"I wish you'd never be born\" for one conversation and none of it was said in jest. I'm not sure which part of it you think he'd be grateful for.", "The ONLY quote we get from that conversation is \u201csometimes while you were a teen yes\u201d so please, tell me more about what you know she told him :)", ">I admitted that I wouldn\u2019t have had him if not for his father. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I had been thinking of giving up custody to his father before he died.\n\nHere are the other quotes that you failed to read. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.", "Those aren\u2019t actually quotes though. We have no idea how she actually laid it out in conversation and there\u2019s a big difference between \u201cI was really struggling and was considering giving custody of you to your father\u201d and \u201cI was going to abandon you\u201d. There\u2019s nuance to the entirety of the conversation that you\u2019re ignoring.", ">Those aren\u2019t actually quotes though. \n\nThey are. Straight from the OP. Are you so desperate to defend her, you are doubting her own words?"]}
