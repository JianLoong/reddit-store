We live in a city with harsh winters and somewhat frequent vehicle thefts, so use of the garage is certainly a privilege. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to share this garage use at all?\n\nSome facts:\n\n* I bought the house we live in and pay for everything to do with the ownership aspect of it. We even have a legal agreement stating that it is my property alone.\n* He pays for half of monthly utility/grocery bills and not a penny into anything else for our home (no mortgage payments, property taxes, household supplies, renovations, maintenance costs, etc.).\n* I make significantly more money than him (but I'm far from being wealthy).\n* Our vehicles are very close in value.\n* His vehicle was given to him outright by a family member (used).\n* I saved up and bought my vehicle (used).\n\nI was really shocked when this came up in conversation because I figured that it's very fair that I use the garage given that I bought both it and the car inside of it, when he basically lives here almost for free and has a car of similar value that cost him nothing to acquire.\n\nI don't want to be one-sided on this so alternate views are appreciated. My initial response to him was an outright \"no\" when the suggestion came up to share use of the garage.\n\n**Edit:** I want to say a sincere thank you for all of your comments, whether they are shooting me down or supporting my stance - I am a bit overwhelmed by the response and don't think I'll be replying to each one of them if there isn't anything to clarify but I want to express my genuine appreciation. Some of what you are taking the time to share is really helping me organize my thoughts as I prepare to have a conversation about this with my partner.", "created_utc": 1667330677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjigs8/aita_for_using_the_singlecar_garage_for_my_own_car/", "score": 3914, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What does he expect re the garage, that you not park there during his time? I mean it just sounds ridiculous, what he's demanding, even w/o regard to who owns what. You've got a single-car garage, so there's really no effective way to share it.", "NTA It's your house. It's your garage. The question is why shouldn't you park your car in garage at the home you own?", "I own the place my partner and I live in. They pay half of everything except renos with the understanding that when we graduate our PhD programs and inevitably move, what I make from the sale of this place will supply the down payment on a home we purchase together. My property has a single carport, and my partner insists I use it. Since I paid the down for this place, pay for renos (it\u2019s a bit of a fixer upper), and it\u2019s in my name, my partner feels I should have the parking spot. I think your bf is getting an extremely good deal and if they don\u2019t like it they can rent a place with a garage. NTA\n\nEdited bc I saw your comment about him also not contributing to household chores equally. I\u2019d encourage you to think about how you are currently splitting the benefits of him living there. Financially he is clearly enjoying 100% of the benefits. It sounds like he benefiting unequally from the way housework is split. What benefits are you enjoying from this arrangement?", "NTA - I am not even understanding what he is proposing here.  Because, I suspect the second you start letting him park in the garage, you will never be able to park in there again.", "NTA\nYour home in which you pay all expenses. If he wants a private garage he could rent one. \nThat he is putting this issue forward shows he is not conscious of the fact that he is living for free and it\u2019s becoming a demanding partner. \ud83d\udea9", "I would say stick to \"no\". Since you are responsible for ALL housing expenses, you deserve the perk. \n\nNTA.", "NTA but you pay for everything for the house and you split shared expenses? What exactly does your BF bring to the table except demands?? Does he do more than his share of household chores? Does he do maintenance on your car like oil changes and keeping the tires full? Does he cook most nights? Those things matter bc if he is a really good boyfriend maybe you would want to let him park in the garage sometimes. However, if he contributes half or less in terms of cooking, cleaning, laundry etc., then He seems a bit entitled", "NTA\n\nThe alternative would be, he uses the garage and not you?", "NTA \n\nYou own the house, pay for the house and all its expenses. The garage is yours to use to protect your other major investment, your car. \n\nIf bf wants to garage his vehicle, he can make other arrangements.", "You should also consider your car insurance.  Mine asks me where I keep my car at night. My insurance is significantly less because I keep my car in the garage. Maybe check your policy and you can use that as another reason to keep your car in the garage.\n\nEdit to add judgement: NTA at all", "NTA it\u2019s your home he\u2019s barely a tenant. Half the utilities and groceries is a sweet deal, that he wouldn\u2019t get anywhere else he should at least be contributing some rent", "NTA.\n\nYou're already putting more into the relationship based on your comments. \n\nYou pay way more than your fair share on \"rent\". You do more of the chores. You contribute more money to shared stuff, sounds like.\n\nHe should be incredibly grateful he has a partner willing to support him so much. \n\nI would say.... offer to split the garage when he splits finances and chores. It's only fair, after all.", "NTA. I don't think how he acquired his car matters. but the fact that it is your house and you pay for most things directly relating to it does.

Let him rent a space somewhere or buy his own home with a garage. \n\nThink long and hard about staying in this relationship.

He can buy his own house and park his car in THAT garage.", "You are the landlord.  There is no rational for a tenant (and he is barely that paying only 1/2 of utilities and groceries) to oust the landlord from using the garage.  If he wants a garage, he can move to a place that offers one for each rental unit.  Your house does not offer that.  He is free to leave if this is such an important issue.\n\nI would like to know his reasons for thinking he is entitled to use the garage at your expense.  He only pays toward shared expenses, he doesn't pay any actual rent so he's already getting a damn sweet deal in housing, and he is claiming you aren't being 'fair' to him.  So what is he bringing to the relationship that makes him think you owe him more than you are already providing?", "Tell him you will split the garage when he:\n1. Pays half the mortgage (as he should anyway, or at least a % based on income)\n2. Contributes an equal share to chores\n\nFrankly I think you should reconsider the boyfriend altogether", "NTA\n\nThat's some real lack of awareness on his part.  Maybe he needs to go off and buy his own house if he wants to have garage parking?", "So, he pays for his own utilities and effectively rents half a room in your house? Unless his nonexistent lease agreement specifies garage access, his car can stay outside.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  If your boyfriend wants to use the garage on occasion, he ought to negotiate for it rather than accuse you of being unfair.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is lucky enough to be able to live in a home he couldn't dream about affording to live in if he wasn't dating you. He's truly lucky. It sounds like he could barely rent a room if he wasn't dating you, because he is already paying upto his limit with half the utilities and groceries. Yet he wants to think he's a homeowner now, without actually lifting a finger or paying anything to own that home. I would straight up write up the amounts you each pay to live in that home and why your contributions give you right to the garage. And I'm saying this, because you aren't married and he isn't contributing to your homelife through child care or doing more chores vs monetary compensation.", "NTA, this guy sounds like a leech tho", "NTA. You bought the house and pay for mostly everything. He only pays for utility / grocery. As far as I am concerned the garage is not grocery.", "NTA.  I specifically told my realtor \"If it doesn't have a garage, I don't even want to look at it\".  \n\nIt's your house that you pay for in it's entirety.  That's not even starting to look at the inequality of the the house and yard work going on here.  I am not really sure why you care about this relationship because is seem pretty one-sided to me.", "Once you stated that it\u2019s YOUR house I automatically decided you were NTA.

You are totally within your rights to keep the garage for yourself guilt-free.", "NTA \n\nSeems like you have a very clear agreement on who owns the garage so that should be the end of the discussion about who parks there.", "NTA. You own and pay for the property, and therefore it is yours to use.

We even have a legal agreement stating that it is my property alone.\n\n> He pays for half of monthly utility/grocery bills and not a penny into anything else for our home (no mortgage payments, property taxes, household supplies, renovations, maintenance costs, etc.).\n\nThese are the only two pertinent facts. He doesn't own the house. He doesn't pay for the house. He doesn't pay for anything related to the house itself. He pays for things that he uses while in the house. \n\nTherefore, it's not reasonable for him to expect to use the garage. He didn't pay for it, so it's not reasonable for him to expect to use it.\n\nIf you feel like being generous, you could work out a sharing agreement for the garage, but I personally would require him to essentially sign a lease agreement for that - he would be depriving you of the use of property that you are paying for, so you deserve to be compensated.\n\nDepending on how your property is set up, you might also look into having a carport built for his car (which he could contribute towards). \n\nBut on the surface of it: NTA. He can use your garage when he pays for it.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like he brings much to the table here. He does few chores, pays few bills yet wants to use the garage when you\u2019re the one that owns and pays for it. Why are you even in this relationship?", "Nta, you own the house and pay the full mortgage so you decide.\nIf he wants to share, he can buy in half the house value and pay half the mortgage", "NTA.  You're a Saint for even worrying about it!", "NTA\nI may be old fashioned but in the 31 years my wife and I have been together, she always got the garage. It's just safer.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is saving so much money from living rent free, he can rent garage parking elsewhere if he needs it.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nIm wondering what you are even getting from this relationship? He barely contributes towards anything, whether its money or chores. Does he treat you right? Do little gestures from time to time to show he cares for you? Has he ever even suggested helping out around the house more, or find a betterpaying job so he can helpmout more financially? Cook you a nice.meal after work now and then to give you a chance to rest for a bit?\n\nYou have the right to use what you have 100% paid for  to.protect something you have bought yourself. Hes got a free house to live in, a maid (sorry but if he doesnt do much cooking or chores then i cant help but feel thats what you are to him) a free car. And now he wants more? I feel thats a little bit entitled.\n\nYes relationships are built on compromise but this argument seems like the tip of an iceberg. Perhaps its time to re-examine everything between you two and come with a better compromise overall, and if you two cannot agree  then its time he finds his own place.", "Pshhhh\n\nWe\u2019re I him, I never would have broached the subject. lol \nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThe other comments are going kinda extreme with making him pay half the mortgage though.\n\nWith 0 equity that\u2019s just being a landlord.", "NTA. It\u2019s your house that you bought.", "NTA it's your house he's the guest. Has he been building resentment for that long? What's going on?", "NTA.  What is his rationale for thinking he should be able to park in the garage when he is not paying rent,when you had the property before you got together,and when he has signed an agreement stating you are the sole owner?  If he were contributing ANYTHING towards the mortgage, i could understand his position, but as it stands i don't understand his reasoning.\n\nIf he wont uphold the agreement, perhaps you can revise the agreement that he can park in the garage X amount of time in return for paying X amount of money per month to \"rent space\" in the garage.  You may want to check with an attorney first and assure that if he pays money to park in garage that he doesn't come back and tey to claim part ownership in your home.\n\nHe seems entitled and selfish.  He hasnt worked for anything he has of value (his car was given to him) and i fear he feels entitled to 1/2 use.of your property despite basically living for free \n\nTo contrast his behavior, i am in a relationship with someone who has a garage.  We split out time between our homes.  But when im there, he assures i have the closest and safest parking, and it.makes it easier for me to bring groceries and other things in.  He as a caring partner wanted me to be safe and more comfortable than he was, he though he owns the property.  Also,.i, not contributing to the mortgage, feel bad for him giving me the best parking and i want him to have it.

Don\u2019t put him on the house until you get married but be sure to see a lawyer first to draw up papers in case you divorce what percentage or amount you get for the house since you are paying all the upkeep. I hope you still have all the receipts and start keeping them. Use a safety deposit box.", "Nta. The only way I would agree to that in the circumstances that you described is if I was wfh and he got up early every day to go to work. Shoveling snow early in the morning definitely sucks. But he's paying $0 in rent. That's crazy. If he wants a garage spot then yall can look at houses to go into together with a 2 car garage.  He should have a nice chunk of change saved up after mooching off of you for so long.

In my opinion that would be the full stop. \n\nRegardless of that, though, there is only one spot, meaning either your car, his car or neither would be in the garage. Relationships are about compromise and this is a small issue that should be workable in a relationship. Does he get up much earlier than you (needs access to his car during colder temperatures)? Do you primarily work from home, so it makes more sense for him to park in the garage as he uses the car more? Do you get the groceries and have to carry lots back home! Aspects like this will determine the way you both feel about this situation and it\u2019s fairness.

No is a very appropriate response in my opinion.

If he is unhappy with the arrangement and it is a serious relationship that you both see a future in, then if a 1 car garage is a problem, perhaps it's time to look at jointly purchasing a home that you both contribute to and suits both your needs. \nIf it's not at that point, as the alternative to the current situation is you park outside, that's not really fair to you as the home owner at all, and it's something he needs to figure out how to mitigate of he has issues with it (ie him investing in a remote car starter/alarm etc). \n\nSide note: I know everyone here loves to stick to strictly what you \"have\" to do and not a touch more. It sounds like you do a lot for your BF and that's amazing. But sometimes just validating someone's feelings when you say no is enough.

A Garage can be kept secure from muggers or attackers, and if it connects to the house provides safe escape to your home.\n\nIf your area is know for higher than average crime, it's much safer for you as a female to have a secure place to both enter and exit your car. You are most vulnerable in that position since the car is off, you don't have free use of your arms and legs, and you're limited in the directions you can go.\n\nAnd attacker can easily over power someone getting out of a car, and as a woman, you have the general disadvantage physically that the average woman has compared to the average male (well, unless you're a trained fighter, MMA expert, or otherwise significantly above-average female physically).\n\nFWIW: I own a home with a one car garage and share it with my buddy who also helped buy it and our renter. Renter pays a full share of utilities and rent. Me and my friend split everything else 50/50. I got the big room and he got the garage.\n\nThere's no complaints.\n\nTo want the Garage, pay no rent, pay no maintenance, and only contribute the consumables (food and utilities) is a *huge* ask.

We even have a legal agreement stating that it is my property alone.\n* He pays for half of monthly utility/grocery bills and not a penny into anything else for our home (no mortgage payments, property taxes, household supplies, renovations, maintenance costs, etc.).\n* I make significantly more money than him (but I'm far from being wealthy).\n* Our vehicles are very close in value.\n* His vehicle was given to him outright by a family member (used).\n* I saved up and bought my vehicle (used).\n\nI was really shocked when this came up in conversation because I figured that it's very fair that I use the garage given that I bought both it and the car inside of it, when he basically lives here almost for free and has a car of similar value that cost him nothing to acquire.\n\nI don't want to be one-sided on this so alternate views are appreciated.

Not for someone to mooch off of all your hard work then complain when it doesn\u2019t go their way.", ">Some people have been talking about wanting to treat their partner equally regardless of how much they are contributing financially \n\nYes but it sounds like the contribution to the household would be unequal even if he WERE contributing financially in an equal way which is even worse!  \nBut like you say the energy being invested as a total is most important.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you are tough on yourself for some minor/reasonable abandonment issues you might sometimes display but he doesn't seem to analyse his own behaviour anywhere near as much.  \n\n\nI bet everyone else is with me in saying we'd love to see a positive update from you in a few weeks about how you're living your best life (with or without current bf, depending how it all goes). xxx", "Weaponized incompetence 101. He presumably is an adult human who is capable of doing things well, but chooses not to because he knows you'll do them if he does a bad job.", "im dissabled ,no job currently,live with my parents. and even i was like \"his dick cant be that good\"", "How does one \u2018baby trap\u2019 someone.

Truthfully I think if my partner were to ever abandon his passion he would be very, very depressed. And I see the joy his work brings to people and I don't want him to ever stop doing it.\n\nIt's funny that I started this post about the garage comment he made earlier today but my takeaway from most of the discussion so far is that I need to have a conversation with him about chores.\n\nThanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.", "I'm not sure, it was a comment made during a heated conversation today that hasn't been addressed further. It caught me off guard and I came here to see what others might think about it because I didn't want to be selfish.", "Thanks. I'm kind of overwhelmed. I made a little post hoping to see both sides of the issue and wasn't expecting such a flood of comments that are largely telling me that I'm not being treated fairly. There are a lot of tears flowing. The post was more about the garage and now I'm just thinking about my life in general and it's... a lot.", "Thanks for caring. For all the times that people shit on the Internet and forums like this, there sure are some genuine people out there that can make a difference.", "Thank you for making me choke on my gummy bears with your comment. Especially since you literally said what I was thinking after reading the last comment!\n\nAlso, NTA, OP!  How can he afford the audacity if he can't even afford half the roof over his head and how does he carry all that entitlement around if he can't carry his weight around under said free roof.....\n\nEdited to add:  he better love you, treat you like you mean the world to him, make you laugh, make you feel safe, and give you the O EVERY TIME because If he's not doing any of these, and nothing else as well... just no!  Know your worth, OP!", "Haha OMG I love this term better than freeloader\u2026 this describes perfectly one of my immediate family members.

My housemate has one and they are super if you get snow in your winters!", "You really are a gem and really care a great deal about your partner. He is very lucky to have you in his life.", "Thanks for answering my qs!\n\nSounds to me like he doesn't really *have* an argument then for why the garage should be a shared space outside of external conditions whereas you have several strong counter arguments for why even with those two factors, it's more imperative for the household that you store your car there more oft-than not.\n\nAs you're the breadwinner (on top of it being *your house*), you nor he(!) can afford for your vehicle to be out of commission the majority of the time versus his (if something horrible were to befall his car).", "You are not alone. Most of us have woken up in a relationship and said \u201cwait a minute, that isn\u2019t right. Wait a min, do they always treat me like this?\u201d \nSending all the hugs. You deserve to be appreciated. You deserve to use the garage that you fully pay for.", "For the entire car? He has one for the front windshield and side mirrors.", "Thanks for saying that. Days like today leave me feeling like he doesn't see it that way at all and it makes me sad because I try to be good.", "Thank you.\n\nHe's commented on not feeling appreciated and that's something that I need to explore as well because I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing that contributes to that.
