We have a 1 year old child named Dravyn.\n\nDravyn has alot of trouble falling asleep and is very restless, and he usually doesn't fall asleep unless he is held or rocked. I found out that for some reason he really loves indian lullabies, so every night, I put him to sleep with songs my mom used to sing for me when I was a kid.\n\nMy husband thought this was really cool, and wanted to get in on the action as well. So he spent a while trying to learn the song Muddhagare Yashoda. At first, I was really touched that he was so accepting of my culture, and that he really wanted to help and be involved as a dad. I thought that was so sweet, and I'll admit, the idea of my husband rocking my son to sleep was pretty sweet.\n\nThe problem is he's really not good. Like he gets the pitch completely wrong, it could be that Carnatic music is hard to learn, but now it's like the song is stuck in his head, and he's singing it everyday when putting Dravyen to sleep, and even humming it sometimes.\n\nI'm starting to go crazy, like the pitch or tune is just so off it's really grating at my ears. I finally told him that I think it's great that he wants to learn, but he should spend some time and effort actually learning Sangeetham, and that he's literally making my ears bleed. I guess that was a little mean, and I tried to apologize, but now he's gotten kind of annoyed, and he's stopped singing to Dravyen at all, when before he would sing american lullabies to him.

You should really just beg for forgiveness because the idea of criticizing your husband for singing to his child is just pathetic", "Yea YTA here. You hurt him in an unnecessary way and took something away from your child that was creating a bond.", "YTA. He's singing to your infant son, not at a concert hall. This is a bonding moment for them as father and son and he's also reinforcing in a positive way that he cares for your culture. Not many people would take the time to learn the song. \n\nAre you seriously having an issue as a grown up to not listen? Get some headphones or take a walk while he sings. This is something you really can't be critical of, because it's not meant for you. If it soothes your son to sleep and lets dad spend quiet time with baby, that's all that's needed for this instance", "YTA.\n\nAnd when you use the word \"literally,\" it means \"literally.\" So, did you really have blood coming out of your ears? No?\n\nThen don't use \"literally.\"\n\nExaggeration is not helping your case. \"Oh, I just couldn't take it any more!\"\n\nI've listened to awful singers before. But I can't imagine anyone singing a soft-pitched lullabye so horrendously badly that I literally couldn't take it. Have you thought about sending your husband to Gitmo? Maybe he could sing to the prisoners, since the Geneva Conventions haven't ruled against that particular kind of torture.\n\nThere are ways you could have helped him learn the song, been encouraging, played recordings of it, etc. But instead, you chose to hurt his feelings with all the nastiness you could muster. Congratulations. You have just earned yourself the sole position of lullabye-singer for your son, and just deprived your husband of a bonding experience. Has it never occurred to you that he might be self-conscious about his voice, and you just demoralized him irreparably? Well, at least you don't have to worry about your husband's off-pitch caterwauling that was \"literally\" making your ears bleed, and was such torture that you couldn't take it any more.\n\nAnd just a suggestion here. Since the only way he apparently learned the song is by listening to you sing it, maybe ***your*** performance is not up to snuff, since his is so terrible. Ya think?\n\nOr maybe you're just Sarah Brightman and he's Pierce Brosnan.", "YTA - my husband is completely tone-deaf but he sings to our son all the time, and the kid loves it.

It's wonderful he wanted to sing to his child especially from your culture. As someone who has spent a lot of time with babies, they don't care how we sound as long as we don't raise our voice.

My mother can\u2019t sing very well, but she is the reason why all of my siblings and I love lullaby\u2019s. Most of my siblings have sung the lullaby\u2019s my mother sang to us as children to their kids. It never mattered to any of us that she couldn\u2019t hold a tune very well, it was the action itself that soothed and comforted us. Granted, my mom sang us american lullaby\u2019s, but imo that doesn\u2019t matter.

How would you feel if he said your singing is horrible ?", "When our girls were infants, we both would sing to them, and I have to say that my wife is not particularly good at carrying a tune.

I\u2019d never tell her to stop because they\u2019re memorises growing up. YTA and a pretentious one at that. The baby will never remember how in tune anyone was, they\u2019ll just remember sharing those moments as they get older. I feel bad for your poor husband who wanted to just bond and share time with his son but instead is getting scolded cause his wife thinks he\u2019s not good enough. I wonder if women like this realise that attitudes like this is potentially why some guys just stop trying; if you\u2019re told over and over and over you\u2019re not doing it right or more accurately translated to MY way, then why keep trying.", "YTA.  I see posts on this subreddit every day, about fathers who do not engage with their babies and children, leaving the parental duties up to their spouses.

Go apologize and just tune it out.", "YTA - Yeah, that was a mean comment and you admitted it.", "I\u2019m afraid you are stuck because telling your husband not to sing lullabies is just pretty negative. \n\nMaybe you could go apologize and ask him to sing lullabies from his family tradition instead? I mean, YTA, but it\u2019s not too late here, I think.\n\nAnd yes, he\u2019s probably not distinguishing pitches properly, since the European based scale is so different.

Most people can't sing well, but it's still sweet to sing to a baby, assuming the baby likes it, so stop being such a snob.

The fact that you can't see that your husband is doing something he loves for your baby, and taking the time to learn and appriciate your culture, is really shitty and it seems to me that maybe you don't like him very much. He seems like a great man and a lovely dad. Shame on you....", "INFO: Is he singing as best as he can and sounding terrible or is he doing it half heartedly and disrespectfully ?", "NAH. Maybe the way you said it was a bit harsh, but it's ok to ask someone to stop doing something that gets on your nerves. Just because someone has good intentions doesn't mean you're obligated to like their behavior or put up with it if it irritates you. It might be a good idea to say that it's just that particular song that bothers you and not all of his singing, but I don't think you were wrong in saying it bothered you.", "I'll be in the minority by saying nta, but i go to karaoke. I know what it's like being stuck there with someone singing something wrong or awful (myself included)\n\nI get to leave though. I get breaks from it. While what your husband is doing is nice, relationships are supposed to be all open and honest. So saying you're singing a song wrong isn't bad, but it does sound like you said it harshly. Not sure why he stopped singing all together\n \nIs your husband tone deaf or has he not heard the lullaby on youtube? \ud83d\ude06 One might be fixable.

NTA, that sounds annoying just politely try and tell him to find another song, maybe in a joking way he will get the hint", "NTA. That would get really annoying! But it\u2019s also really sweet that he wants to be involved. What if he sang some of his own childhood lullabies so that your little one has even more loving memories?

Secondly , how are you and your husband handling cultural difference in your marriage? Your child is both biracial and likely bicultural or potentially bucultural. If he\u2019s being raised in the west he is likely to be very immersed in western culture and not yours. If it\u2019s important for your son to maintain aspects of Indian culture then it seems to me a supportive partner who is also trying to immerse himself in a culture not his own is a bonus and not a negative, even if he gets it wrong sometimes.
