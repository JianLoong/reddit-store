We had a big assembly with the entire school (K-5). It was some sort of play. A few of the actors came out into the crowd of students to select random kids to go on stage. I wanted NO parts of that, which OF COURSE meant I\u2019d be grabbed. I remember pulling my arm away and the actor grabbed me again. I pulled my arm away again and just said no. I remember him or her saying I was being a brat and grabbed a classmate, who went onstage. After the performance, we returned to the classroom and my classmate gleefully told our entire class that the actor told her I was such a baby for not going onstage. Like WTF? Looking back, I wish I had caused a scene because that actor was not cool and quite frankly, audience participation should be voluntary not forced.", "NTA!
