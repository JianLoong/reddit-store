I did make it a point to tell her she looked lovely but she went into panic mode after I told her she was overdressed as she thought my in-laws were the type of family to dress nicely even at home based on how they dress in public and my mother-in-law's personality.\n\nI told her it wasn\u2019t a big deal but she wouldn\u2019t calm down and she ended up fighting with my brother-in-law as he hadn\u2019t warned her and refusing to go to the dinner. He blamed me because he thinks I made her feel unwelcome with my unnecessary comment when I knew how nervous she was. I told him he could\u2019ve just taken her home to change quickly instead of arguing with her which has only made him more upset with me.

It's understandable that she may have gone into panic mode, and it's unfortunate that it led to a fight with your brother-in-law and their decision to skip the dinner altogether.  \n\n\n  \nIt may have been more helpful to offer to show her what you typically wear to these dinners so she could feel more comfortable and not out of place, or to suggest that it's a casual affair so she can dress accordingly. Alternatively, you could have just let her wear what she wanted without comment and let her make her own judgment about the appropriateness of her outfit.  \n\n\nIn this case, it seems like your comment may have contributed to unnecessary tension and conflict, so it might be worth apologizing to your brother-in-law and his girlfriend to try to smooth things over.", "YTA.

Telling someone they're overdressed is rude. All you had to do was tell her you weren't going to change. Suggesting she go home to change was also extremely rude.

I can see this whole event like a normal every day family get together and you said that you are doing this twice a month, which is honestly amazing to hear. Family is important and family relations require time and dedication. But I am really struggling to figure out the level of dress up here. I imagine the girlfriend wearing something like a very formal dress, high heels, elegant jewelry, having her hair put up... But it is hard to me to think that her boyfriend would not tell her to tone it down if she looked like she was about to go to a Great Gatsby party. The way you put it so far, it sounds like your remark was really unnecessary if she wasn't overdressed to the point of looking really ridiculous, and it seems to me that if that was the case her boyfriend would have said so.", "NTA You didn't say anything until she expressed confusion over how you were dressed.

Like if she wasn\u2019t so nervous; then telling her she\u2019s overdressed would\u2019ve just blown over and not been a big deal. And it sounds like you were being honest without thinking much of it. \n\nWhy is there dinner twice a month and it\u2019s such a big deal? It does sound intimidating af. And they only allow her to attend now that she\u2019s engaged? It\u2019s weird. All of it does sound very formal aside from the dress code", "NTA...

I don't understand why people are calling you the AH", "NTA\n\nShe would have realized she was overdressed the moment she got there.

No. Brother-in-law is the a-hole here. He could have warned her before hand or taken her home. And now he's trying to blame you.", "NTA. You took it too far by telling her she was overdressed.

She was nervous and wanted to make a good impression, and there is nothing wrong with dressing up. It's better to overdress than underdress. Same also applies to new job (always rock up on your first day in smart business attire and gage the dress code based on other employees). My husband's family are extremely casual and mine aren't so much, and I always dress up and wear some makeup. It's called making an effort and it's sweet she wanted to make a good first impression. I feel bad for her if she ends up marrying into the family because you've now given her self doubt.", "YTA-you knew she was nervous and put a lot of effort into her outfit when she WAS MEETING HER BOYFRIEND'S PARENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME, why on earth would you make her more nervous by making her think she was overdressed? Especially right before the dinner?? better to be overdressed at a casual thing than to be underdressed at a fancy thing in my opinion.", "YTA.  Perhaps a tad jealous, too?", "YTA better over dressed than under dressed. You needlessly causing  her anxiety by making her feel self conscious.", "YTA. Do you think she didn\u2019t realize she was overdressed and she needed YOU to point it out?", "YTA because she wasn't in a situation where she could have easily remedied the situation. Your heart was possibly in the right place but your execution wasn't great - if she'd had a change of clothes that was more appropriate and she'd asked you whether her outfit was appropriate I would have said N T A but telling an already nervous person they're dressed inappropriately when they don't have a change of clothes is just ratcheting their anxiety up to 11.   \n\n\nAlso is this something your in-laws would genuinely care about/judge her for? If so they kind of suck. If not then I think you made her more anxious for no reason.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t seem like you said it with any ill Intent nor negativity. She was really nervous so it\u2019s okay to tell her she would stand out if she really wanted to fit in. She may have been really uncomfortable being so dressed up with everybody else causal. Why does everybody here think you should have ignored or danced around her question?  She didn\u2019t ask it directly but obviously wanted to know. I don\u2019t get what you did wrong. Just because some people here like to be dressed up doesn\u2019t matter because she wanted to fit in for this occasion. It would be the same if she was underdressed. I agree better over than under but she didn\u2019t want either and it was seemingly obvious. Her bf should have handled it when he saw her getting dressed in the first place.", "Unless she had a full-length ball gown with opera gloves, tiara, and diamonds dripping from her neck, she was not overdressed. And even then, you should have kept your mouth shut. YTA", "YTA. So you're mad she put in effort when you don't? I don't understand the logic in this.

My sister and SIL will both be in jeans and I\u2019m there in a dress and I don\u2019t care.", "If someone told me I was overdressed, I could care less.

How was that the most socially adroit choice you could have made?", "Did you not think she'd be worrying the whole time? Maybe next time just leave it.", "People who value their comfort who enjoy being casual around family and consider this new girlfriend a new member of the family.

That\u2019s the part I think is weird. If your family is having frequent casual gatherings, how is this your girlfriend\u2019s first family dinner?\n\nI very much value my comfort and I hope my kids feel comfortable bringing their partners over for a sweatpants dinner long before marriage is on the table.", "Yes.

Who cares if she\u2019s dressed up.", "What was she wearing that you think she needed to change???", "How overdressed are we talking? A black tie gown to a jeans-and-tshirt event? Or just something slightly dressier than everyone else was wearing? If I want to make a good impression I always err on the side of overdressing rather than underdressing.", "Okay, so technically somebody is always going to be more dressed than everyone else. It's better to be that person than the underdressed one. She didn't need to change. Plus, it leaves a good impression. Gives the impression that she cares what her soon to be in laws think. Which is a positive thing.", "Was she wearing a ball gown and tiara?", "Not everyone needs to be a cookie cutter version of what you consider normal attire. Sometimes girls just like dressing up for dates even if it\u2019s BBQ, cuz it\u2019s fun! She was trying to make a good first impression. Or perhaps BIL was gonna announce engagement and she wanted to look nice.", "NTA. \nI think everyone is missing the forest for the trees. They see it as you policing a woman's right to dress how she chooses. Which is not what you said happened, AND she is the one that brought it up when asking if you were gonna change first (which by the way is extremely rude to me. Maybe I'm being petty but that sounds snobbish to me. TV shows have the Mean Girls saying that all the time trying to hurt feelings. But that could just be me reading too much into it. Anyhow). The funny thing to me is people are disagreeing with your comment here about her feeling worse realizing it upon arrival when that's exactly where my mind went. I mean this woman flips out at you when you answer politely a question she asked, flips out at her soon to be fianc\u00e9 for having the audacity to not say \"Hey you look too beautiful\" or whatever she expected him to warn her with, had a panic attack, then refused to go to the dinner like a toddler throwing a tantrum. To me, that says if she got to the dinner and realized it, she would have had a meltdown, caused a scene, and either stormed out or locked herself in a bathroom lol. Either that or based on her comment about YOUR clothing, may have made snobby comments all night about everyone else. Neither of which would have been great for her or your BIL when this is her first family dinner spent with the family. Not a great way to ingratiate herself tbh.", "OP cares cuz the girl probably looked better."]}
