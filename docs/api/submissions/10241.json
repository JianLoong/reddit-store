I imagine the girlfriend wearing something like a very formal dress, high heels, elegant jewelry, having her hair put up... But it is hard to me to think that her boyfriend would not tell her to tone it down if she looked like she was about to go to a Great Gatsby party.

Same also applies to new job (always rock up on your first day in smart business attire and gage the dress code based on other employees). My husband's family are extremely casual and mine aren't so much, and I always dress up and wear some makeup. It's called making an effort and it's sweet she wanted to make a good first impression.

Do you think she didn\u2019t realize she was overdressed and she needed YOU to point it out?", "YTA because she wasn't in a situation where she could have easily remedied the situation. Your heart was possibly in the right place but your execution wasn't great - if she'd had a change of clothes that was more appropriate and she'd asked you whether her outfit was appropriate I would have said N T A but telling an already nervous person they're dressed inappropriately when they don't have a change of clothes is just ratcheting their anxiety up to 11.   \n\n\nAlso is this something your in-laws would genuinely care about/judge her for?

Why does everybody here think you should have ignored or danced around her question?  She didn\u2019t ask it directly but obviously wanted to know. I don\u2019t get what you did wrong.

Which is not what you said happened, AND she is the one that brought it up when asking if you were gonna change first (which by the way is extremely rude to me. Maybe I'm being petty but that sounds snobbish to me. TV shows have the Mean Girls saying that all the time trying to hurt feelings. But that could just be me reading too much into it. Anyhow). The funny thing to me is people are disagreeing with your comment here about her feeling worse realizing it upon arrival when that's exactly where my mind went. I mean this woman flips out at you when you answer politely a question she asked, flips out at her soon to be fianc\u00e9 for having the audacity to not say \"Hey you look too beautiful\" or whatever she expected him to warn her with, had a panic attack, then refused to go to the dinner like a toddler throwing a tantrum. To me, that says if she got to the dinner and realized it, she would have had a meltdown, caused a scene, and either stormed out or locked herself in a bathroom lol. Either that or based on her comment about YOUR clothing, may have made snobby comments all night about everyone else. Neither of which would have been great for her or your BIL when this is her first family dinner spent with the family. Not a great way to ingratiate herself tbh.", "OP cares cuz the girl probably looked better.", "Info: When you made the comment , did she had enough time to go change her clothes?\n\nAnyway, I think I'm going with NTA, because it wasn't like your comment came out of nowhere. If she asked you if you were going to change your clothes, I can get a picture of the contrast between her clothes and yours. Yeah, maybe it wasn't the best thing you could've said, but she was going to feel uncomfortable/panic anyway if she was that nervous.", "NTA.

It would have created a bond between you two.", "Nta she asked if you were changing. It's pretty clear that she's trying to Guage the level of formality she needs to adhere to.

That\u2019s all that happened here.", "NTA. she asked, you responded. she overreacted when 1) she had time to go home and change 2) she could have just owned it. it\u2019s not like you up and told her out of the blue that she was overdressed, she asked if you were going to change and you didn\u2019t mean any harm by letting her know.", "I'm gonna go with NTA, TA being the BIL. He would have known his partner was over dressed and could have told her. He's also TA for blaming OP when it's not really anyone's fault.\n\nBIL's partner asked about OP's clothes, OP explained dress is casual and said she was a bit over dressed, which was clearly true if the partner noticed the discrepancy between the way they were dressed. I don't think that's a particularly bad comment. I've been told I'm overdressed before and I did not fly off into a panic and skip out on the event. I understand she was nervous, but this seems disproportionate and I don't think it's fair to expect OP to have predicted she'd react so badly. There are plenty of people who would prefer to be warned they're over dressed before they go to something.", "NTA you told her the truth, something BIL should have told her. I personally would have been embarrassed if I overdressed and nobody told me.", "Soft YTA\nShe DID broach the subject, however you could\u2019ve just said \u201ceh, it\u2019s a pretty casual vibe, usually!\u201d Or something along those lines.

Obviously she cares or the comment wouldn\u2019t haven\u2019t affected her.

I would. Why not look nice and make her feel good & welcome on such an important night?", "I completely agree with the ESH. Although, I can kind of see why the parents might be disappointed that she missed the first family dinner she was invited to. This whole situation seems to be messier than it needed to be. Him needing to be practically engaged to invite her and them normally dressing formally does seem to indicate these are more formal people and her choosing to dress up makes sense. Op should\u2019ve never called her overdressed just let her know they weren\u2019t changing because it was casual. I don\u2019t know why BIL didn\u2019t tell her the dress code or at least de escalate her panic by offering to take her to get changed really quickly instead of continuing the fight by arguing. And the girlfriend fighting BIL and missing her first family dinner is probably going to look worse than if she had just gone dressed as she was. Op should just reach out to apologize to smooth things over and learn to be more polite.", "Thank you.  These judgments are mindboggling.", "This is such a cute idea. Practical or not, I like it lol", "iWork in a public facing job and people constantly ask me why I\u2019m dressed up or why am I so fancy. I\u2019m not wearing anything spectacular or anything.

I'm always like, it takes a lot less effort to put this on than a Tshirt and jeans to be honest! And it's more comfortable half the time.", "I think it\u2019s clear that the clothes were a huge deal to her though because she\u2019s the one who brought up the difference in how they were dressed to op to begin with.

And who waits until they\u2019re ready to propose to finally have dinner with the family?", "Precisely.", "No that\u2019s true she didn\u2019t.

No one wants to be under or over dressed. It's not your fault for sure. I absolutely dressed up to meet in laws but my s/o didn't make me meet his whole family all at once.

There was no way for you to know that she would have a full-on meltdown because of nerves. Your BIL is the asshole for not stopping her from leaving like that!

You only said something because she commented on your outfit. Not because you were giving her a heads up or trying to be helpful like you claim. You literally say it right there in the post.

So, asshole, but in the gentlest possible terms, it's not like anyone's going to Hell for this.", "Did you miss the part where she initiated the conversation by accusing OP of being underdressed?", "But saying your overdressed isn't an insult? Especially when OP said whatever she was wearing looked good and was okay to wear. The GF shouldn't have acted like she did. I've been told I'm overdressed before, and i could have cared less. It's not that big of a deal. All im saying is imagine is the GF got and then realized. She would have thrown a bigger fit", "She only made a comment after she asked. Then proceeded to tell her that her outfit was fine and looked good. I mean, if she acted this way at just being told, imagine if she got their and then realized. She would have been more upset. Being told you're overdressed isn't an insult or anything. Like she blew it out of proportion", "She didn\u2019t comment she answered a question.", "She didn't make her feel crappy though. Saying your overdressed isn't really rude. It's not even an insult. She was even said what she was wearing was fine and looked good. Plus, if the GF throws this big a fit at just being told. She wouldn't be more upset if she got there and then realized? I mean, she could have gone this time and made a joke about it. Then, I know better for next time", "Actually she could have just replied \"it's not necessary, we can all dress as we like, fancy or not, don't worry about it\". OP was judgemental.", "I come from a country where high heels were a go-to until recently, you can meet a girl in high heels walking in a park (a big park). I also tend to dress nicely. It was very stressful when my ex always hinted that I was overdressed. We lived in Hong Kong where the standards are very different, and I totally accept that people are more relaxed but I still want to enjoy my a bit more elegant style...", "Right? Maybe that\u2019s just her style. Maybe that\u2019s how she feels most comfortable. It\u2019s always so baffling to me how often people assume everything about your personal appearance is for their benefit. \n\nYTA- you could have just said we don\u2019t really dress for dinner. There was absolutely no need to call her out on actually putting her best foot forward when having dinner with the in-laws.", "Well, for me personally, I'm usually comfortable dressed nicely, but when someone says it's too much, that makes me uncomfortable and too conscious", "Why isn't it the option to just be dressed however one likes?\nI spent years in an environment where people mostly wore sweats. Should I have thrown away my dresses and bought sweats to match? I don't think so, we can be different, no one has to parrot the others. OP could have gone with \"it's okay\" but she chose \"boo you're overdressed!\"", "Judging by her reaction, she would have flipped out  once getting to their house and realizing she was overdressed. If just saying it to her, set her off. Plus, she asked OP, and OP wasn't stuck up about it and even tried to compliment her. NTA, the GF blew it out of proportion.", "I genuinely can't imagine what world I would leave before being over dressed to something. Also, it isn't weird for her to dress up more than normal to meet her boyfriend's parent.\n\nGirl sounds like she has some anxiety problems.", "She didn't accuse she asked", "I see, thanks for explaining that perspective.", "If someone told me I was overdressed, whether I asked or not, I\u2019d just be like ah shit oh well. And I\u2019m notoriously a quite anxious person. This is a really weird reaction on the gf\u2019s part. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not just about her outfit.", "She didn't make it a big deal though? Only after being asked about her outfit she explained she was over dressed and then said she still looked good. She didn't try to bring her down. And saying your overdressed isn't a insult either. The GF blew this out of proportion. Imagine if she got their and then realized. She probably would of thrown a bigger fit", "My five year old loves to hang out in his \u2018fancy clothes\u2019. Waistcoat, blazer, bow tie etc, even if he\u2019s just chilling and watching tv ^_^", "You know you can just leave your OWN comment, right? That'd be easier than making the exact same comment to everyone you disagree with, surely?\n\nYou're acting like a little kid tapping someone on the shoulder, giggling, and running away. Not an effective way to communicate or get attention.", "I think if you put a forward slash before the carrot it won't automatically use the text formatting code, like this \\^_^", "I could have kept going too, so many people just failed to even read the post."]}
