I imagine the girlfriend wearing something like a very formal dress, high heels, elegant jewelry, having her hair put up... But it is hard to me to think that her boyfriend would not tell her to tone it down if she looked like she was about to go to a Great Gatsby party.

Same also applies to new job (always rock up on your first day in smart business attire and gage the dress code based on other employees). My husband's family are extremely casual and mine aren't so much, and I always dress up and wear some makeup. It's called making an effort and it's sweet she wanted to make a good first impression.

Do you think she didn\u2019t realize she was overdressed and she needed YOU to point it out?", "YTA because she wasn't in a situation where she could have easily remedied the situation. Your heart was possibly in the right place but your execution wasn't great - if she'd had a change of clothes that was more appropriate and she'd asked you whether her outfit was appropriate I would have said N T A but telling an already nervous person they're dressed inappropriately when they don't have a change of clothes is just ratcheting their anxiety up to 11.   \n\n\nAlso is this something your in-laws would genuinely care about/judge her for?

Why does everybody here think you should have ignored or danced around her question?  She didn\u2019t ask it directly but obviously wanted to know. I don\u2019t get what you did wrong.

Which is not what you said happened, AND she is the one that brought it up when asking if you were gonna change first (which by the way is extremely rude to me. Maybe I'm being petty but that sounds snobbish to me. TV shows have the Mean Girls saying that all the time trying to hurt feelings. But that could just be me reading too much into it. Anyhow). The funny thing to me is people are disagreeing with your comment here about her feeling worse realizing it upon arrival when that's exactly where my mind went. I mean this woman flips out at you when you answer politely a question she asked, flips out at her soon to be fianc\u00e9 for having the audacity to not say \"Hey you look too beautiful\" or whatever she expected him to warn her with, had a panic attack, then refused to go to the dinner like a toddler throwing a tantrum. To me, that says if she got to the dinner and realized it, she would have had a meltdown, caused a scene, and either stormed out or locked herself in a bathroom lol. Either that or based on her comment about YOUR clothing, may have made snobby comments all night about everyone else. Neither of which would have been great for her or your BIL when this is her first family dinner spent with the family. Not a great way to ingratiate herself tbh.", "OP cares cuz the girl probably looked better.", "Info: When you made the comment , did she had enough time to go change her clothes?\n\nAnyway, I think I'm going with NTA, because it wasn't like your comment came out of nowhere. If she asked you if you were going to change your clothes, I can get a picture of the contrast between her clothes and yours. Yeah, maybe it wasn't the best thing you could've said, but she was going to feel uncomfortable/panic anyway if she was that nervous.", "NTA.

It would have created a bond between you two.", "Nta she asked if you were changing. It's pretty clear that she's trying to Guage the level of formality she needs to adhere to.

That\u2019s all that happened here.", "NTA. she asked, you responded. she overreacted when 1) she had time to go home and change 2) she could have just owned it. it\u2019s not like you up and told her out of the blue that she was overdressed, she asked if you were going to change and you didn\u2019t mean any harm by letting her know.", "I'm gonna go with NTA, TA being the BIL. He would have known his partner was over dressed and could have told her. He's also TA for blaming OP when it's not really anyone's fault.\n\nBIL's partner asked about OP's clothes, OP explained dress is casual and said she was a bit over dressed, which was clearly true if the partner noticed the discrepancy between the way they were dressed. I don't think that's a particularly bad comment. I've been told I'm overdressed before and I did not fly off into a panic and skip out on the event. I understand she was nervous, but this seems disproportionate and I don't think it's fair to expect OP to have predicted she'd react so badly. There are plenty of people who would prefer to be warned they're over dressed before they go to something.", "NTA you told her the truth, something BIL should have told her. I personally would have been embarrassed if I overdressed and nobody told me.", "Soft YTA\nShe DID broach the subject, however you could\u2019ve just said \u201ceh, it\u2019s a pretty casual vibe, usually!\u201d Or something along those lines.

Now we know why your in laws don't like you... Right?", "YTA and there was no reason to make someone already nervous more nervous.  This jumped out at me \"My brother-in-law is planning to propose to his girlfriend so his parents said it was okay for him to start bringing her to them.\"  WTF?", "I don\u2019t really get this comment. Obviously she cares or the comment wouldn\u2019t haven\u2019t affected her. If that comment set her off, then turning up and being overdressed would also have set her off.", "Also not to mention if I, or anyone I imagine, walk into an event overdressed I immediately know about it. \"Hey you're overdressed\" meets \"Yeah no shit Sherlock\"", "Or be supportive and also step up your clothing to support her? I would. Why not look nice and make her feel good & welcome on such an important night?", "I completely agree with the ESH. Although, I can kind of see why the parents might be disappointed that she missed the first family dinner she was invited to. This whole situation seems to be messier than it needed to be. Him needing to be practically engaged to invite her and them normally dressing formally does seem to indicate these are more formal people and her choosing to dress up makes sense. Op should\u2019ve never called her overdressed just let her know they weren\u2019t changing because it was casual. I don\u2019t know why BIL didn\u2019t tell her the dress code or at least de escalate her panic by offering to take her to get changed really quickly instead of continuing the fight by arguing. And the girlfriend fighting BIL and missing her first family dinner is probably going to look worse than if she had just gone dressed as she was. Op should just reach out to apologize to smooth things over and learn to be more polite.", "Thank you.  These judgments are mindboggling.", "This is such a cute idea. Practical or not, I like it lol", "iWork in a public facing job and people constantly ask me why I\u2019m dressed up or why am I so fancy. I\u2019m not wearing anything spectacular or anything. Most of my dresses come from old navy or target, clearance sales etc.", "I am also perpetually overdressed, it's only weird when someone makes it a big deal because they're uncomfortable that I look nice and they look comfy", "I'm picturing a full tuxedo and top hat, Mr peanut style.", "Did you give her this heads up while she still had time to change if she chose to? Why do I feel that you didn\u2019t?", "Good point. What a kind opportunity to be like yes I am going to go change! Lol", "This \u2b06\ufe0f", "Maybe he didn't see her as overdressed. Maybe he knew she was stressed and her clothes weren't a huge deal. Maybe because he didn't know OP would make it a point to make her feel uncomfortable.", "I find that most of the time when I wear a dress, even if it's a plain cheap summer dress from Target, people will comment I'm dressed fancy. I'm always like, it takes a lot less effort to put this on than a Tshirt and jeans to be honest! And it's more comfortable half the time.", "I think it\u2019s clear that the clothes were a huge deal to her though because she\u2019s the one who brought up the difference in how they were dressed to op to begin with. And it was a apparently a big enough difference for her to ask op if she was changing. Op said she wasn\u2019t going to say anything until she brought it up. If the difference was significant enough for her to notice and say something she would\u2019ve definitely noticed that everyone in the party was dressed down but her.", "Well I do appreciate a man that likes overdressing!", "What exactly was she wearing?", "She was probably nervous about the entire situation and wanted to make a good impression. OP didn't need to add to the anxiety.", "Thankfully I disliked my in-laws from the day they called my fianc\u00e9 useless to his face, so I\u2019ve never felt the need to suck up to them.", "I  think Reddit made MIL seem like typical overbearing people ig. it just overrules your understanding sometimes.", "Overdressed enough that the GF realized she wasn\u2019t dressed like OP\u2026so that much overdressed that it was obvious to her.  And yes, OP specifically said they could have gone home and changed but instead gf and brother had an argument.  And who waits until they\u2019re ready to propose to finally have dinner with the family?", "Precisely.", "No that\u2019s true she didn\u2019t. But clearly the gf also felt BIL should\u2019ve given her the heads up and instead of calming down the situation, or taking her to get changed, he then started arguing with his gf and they ended up totally bailing on their family dinner. That\u2019s why I gave this an ESH .", "Pretty bad when your own folks say shit like that about their own kid.", "It sounds like that's the family's decision that she's only now \"permitted\" to come (it's okay to start bringing her)... which is a bit odd. I get not taking your SO to meet the parents after the first date, but presumably if it's proposal territory it's been quite a while of serious dating."]}
