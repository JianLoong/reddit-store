(Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they\u2019re conservative and christians but lovely people. \n\nAnd they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of \u201clet us dig and let the food keep us quiet.\u201d This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn\u2019t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.\n\nI dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y\u2019know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. \u201cThis is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!\u201d My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, \u201cLet the food keep us quiet.\u201d I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. \n\nAfter a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn\u2019t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn\u2019t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.\n\nMy boyfriend later told me that was an asshole move, that I should\u2019ve just kept quiet or eat alone in the kitchen. I understand their family traditions and rules, but it was so weird. I just couldn't take it anymore. Was I being an asshole though?", "created_utc": 1668362131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu8tm5/aita_for_leaving_after_being_told_to_be_quiet_at/", "score": 14589, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now, this may seem unusual to you, but we were being literal about the food keeping us quiet. In our household we like to take this time to be quiet and enjoy our food.

Do you think they feel free to talk when they eat at other peoples homes? Or maybe they don\u2019t get invited over?

Can you imagine what holiday meals would like? What about a BBQ? No thanks, that\u2019s just too much for me. You did nothing wrong since you went with the expectation that meal time would be a normal experience and your boyfriend did nothing to prepare you beforehand. \n\nAlso? Im not saying break up or anything, but picture a future where potential children would have to endure that. Again, no thanks. Keep your super creepy restrictive tradition to yourselves, thanks.", "I would be thanking my lucky stars that I'm still young and not tied down to this wierd family.

That\u2019s 100% on him.", "NTA \n\nThis is something your BF should have discussed with you beforehand. Anything that has strict rules should be discussed beforehand to give the new person the option of deciding if they want to participate.

If his family was that odd he should have warmed you before the meal. That was a really weird experience and I honestly can\u2019t fault you for your reaction.", "NTA - why didn't he warn you ahead of time? Kind of a thing you'd think to tell someone before introducing them to your family. \"Hey by the way, we don't speak at the table, like at all\"", "NTA - and now you know never to eat with them again!", "NTA. Your bf should have warned you that you were expected to be silent during dinner.", "NTA why didn't he gives you a heads up on how they do things?", "NTA. Your boyfriend should have warned you. But besides that, his parents were terribly rude to you. Their behavior was strange, because they acted like the \u201cno talking at dinner\u201d thing was some sort of sacred social rule, and you violated it. All you did was make a polite remark, you didn\u2019t recite a dirty limerick or spit in someone\u2019s food. But instead of simply saying \u201csorry, but we prefer not to talk while we eat\u201d, they treated you like a child, raised their voices to you, and tried to banish you to the kitchen as if to shame you. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019ve never hosted anyone from outside the family in their home and had to explain their rules for the table before. Being kind to a guest should be more important than strictly not talking during dinner.

Furthermore, he actually expected you to go in the kitchen and eat alone?  Ugh, no, I am sorry.  I think not.  That is utterly ridiculous AND appalling!", "Please update about your breakup. The relationship must be over. Your BF is terrible at communication and the way he just threw you to the wolves during this dinner without any advanced warning should be a deal breaker. NTA", "NTA. They're absolutely assholes for not explaining their rule to you in a clear way rather than passive-aggressively shushing you and threatening to send you to eat elsewhere like a child when it became clear that your boyfriend hadn't told you in advanced. Your boyfriend is an asshole for not warning you of this in advanced.", "NTA and it's just weird to me. Meals are when most people share their day with each other.

I get that people have different rules for dining at home, but there's such a thing as being a rude host and I would have just gotten up and left. It's not like any of them would have said anything lol.", "NTA your bf is though. He should of warned you !", "Your bf is TA for not explaining this strange/uncommon? eating ritual beforehand. You're NTA", "NTA.\n\nInvite them to dinner at your place and talk your ass off.", "NTA. The marinara flags are flying.

Like you are a 5 year old in a time out is utterly ridiculous! \n\nYour BF is a complete AH for not preparing you first.\n\nIt is their house and indeed their rules but that in NO way means you have to stay there whilst feeling uncomfortable. \n\nI grew up listening to that crap! \"It's my house and it's my rules if you don't like it there is the door!\" Was used as a weapon to control me until I grew up and got my own place. \n\nI would never in a million years try to implement my rules in someone else's home but you are in no way making me stay in someone else's home where I feel uncomfortable. \n\nYour house is your castle, have whatever rules you please but don't be surprised if I don't want to be there to follow your rules!\n\nI would seriously be considering how compatible your relationship is?", "NTA\n\nReally? Eat in the kitchen as punishment? Wow. I have nothing to say to that.", "Eat alone in the kitchen? Like you're a child being punished? Oh, hell no. This is on your BF. He should have told you ahead of time that his family doesn't talk at all during meals. He set you up to fail.

Also, run.   \n\n\nI keep turning this over in my head and there's just no way this ends particularly well.  Boyfriend did not tell you beforehand. Boyfriend didn't explain in the moment. Boyfriend allows his parents to scold you and banish you from the dinner table. Boyfriend gets mad at you when you removed yourself from an extremely uncomfortable situation. That is a hard nope for me, my friend. You're almost a year in to the relationship and you're just now meeting them? There's a reason for that and I'm betting this dinner table be silent fuckery is only the tip of a massive iceburg you do not want to run into. If I were you I'd chalk this glancing blow up as a learning experience and jump ship, because my friend, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.

He should have prepared you.\n\nThis reminds me of a time we had a guest staying at my parents' house. For dinner his first night it was a small gathering, just Mom, Dad, myself, and our guest. I'm the youngest of 5, and we usually had someone extra at the table, so this night it was quiet. \n\nAt one point the guest just sat back and looked at the three of us in amazement. \"You're having three different conversations and yet, you all are following all three topics!\"\n\nIn the six weeks he stayed with us he got the hang of it! To us, it was a quiet dinner LOL", "NTA. That is SUPER FUCKING BIZARRE. Why did your boyfriend not tell you his family are literal psychopaths?

He must realize it's unusual. Your BF should have warned you ahead of time that this was a strick rule in their home. \n\nHis parents were the hosts. Usually rules of hospitality say we should try to make our guests feel comfortable.This would include include any religious or familial traditions/rules. After your first comment would have been a good time since then it was obvious you didn't know what was going on. \n\nAfter your second attempt at conversation would have also worked. But a kindly explanation. Your BF could have also offered to eat in the kitchen with you. \n\nLeaving seems to be a bit of an extreme reaction. I can understand how uncomfortable you were but silence for 30 minutes is not that big of a deal once you realized what was going on. Is it odd? Sure, but it's there home, you are a guest and depending on how serious you and your bf are, might be seeing them for a long time. You said you got along with them before dinner. So for a first meeting, you could of muddled through and discussed how to handle it with your bf after. \n\nSo yeah ESH.", "Etah--your bf should have warned you ahead of time and you should have been grown-up enough to deal.", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriend is the biggest AH for not telling you beforehand what to expect.

It doesn\u2019t seem like they were specifically being mean to OP, it\u2019s just what they do.  I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s religious, and they sit in silence to think/contemplate the blessings of God, or something similar. But it would have been nice for them to explain this.\n\nOP is the AH because even after finally figuring out that they had some unusual customs, still couldn\u2019t contain themselves and sit for 10-15 minutes in silence.

(Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they\u2019re conservative and christians but lovely people. \n\nAnd they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of \u201clet us dig and let the food keep us quiet.\u201d This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn\u2019t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.\n\nI dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y\u2019know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. \u201cThis is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!\u201d My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, \u201cLet the food keep us quiet.\u201d I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. \n\nAfter a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn\u2019t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn\u2019t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.\n\nMy boyfriend later told me that was an asshole move, that I should\u2019ve just kept quiet or eat alone in the kitchen. I understand their family traditions and rules, but it was so weird. I just couldn't take it anymore. Was I being an asshole though?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I were you op, I would prep for the next dinner by learning sign language. That way you can communicate silently.", "NTA. This is very weird", "NTA \n\nbut your bf sure is for not letting you know what a freak show his family is. Lol. Wtf.", "NTA. That must have been excruciating. And wtf is up with the bf not giving you a heads up?\n\nYou need to discuss this with him. If you stay together, will he expect you to eat in silence? What if you have kids? Could you subject them to such grandparents?", "NTA. You said you were eating with a family, not a cult.", "NTA. How fucking weird. But to each their own. Your BF should have warned you. He's the total AH in this situation.", "NTA. He should\u2019ve warned you so that you knew what you were getting in to.

NTA but like RED FLAG. Don't marry into that family. The factbthry thought it was ok to shhh you. Big no", "NTA. You should have been informed what the families  rules and traditions were so you were prepared. His parents were very out of place to shush\u2019s you instead of simply saying \u201c our tradition is we don\u2019t talk when we eat\u201d. But your boyfriend is a major AH for them blaming the whole thing on you.", "NTA it\u2019s funny reading I would have laughed", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA.\n\nThat is extremely odd and your bf is the A H for not giving you a heads up. This is definitely something you warn a guest about.", "I\u2019m petty. I would have gone to the kitchen and blown up his phone with text messages.", "NTA, your boyfriend is for not making it clear the absolute insanity you were walking into.

Are there other people here that eat dinner like this? If so, do you warn newcomers?", "NTA. Instead of shushing OP like a child bf's dad could've simply explained that there's a no talking rule during dinner. OP is allowed to laugh, or leave, during an uncomfortable situation.

He should've definitely walked you through your parent's traditions. He should've also talked to his family and let them know that you're new to this tradition and to give you a break.   \n\n\nPerfectly reasonable for you to be confused by the scenario, and perfectly reasonable for the parents to have household traditions.

Ideally, your bf would've warned you ahead of time. But if he forgot, the polite thing for them to do would be to calmly explain \"In this household, we don't speak during dinner in order to \\[insert values here\\].\" Just shushing you is rude and ridiculous. I find it very hard to believe that they're not aware that plenty of other households don't practice the same silence during meals. \n\nAlso, your bf saying that it was rude for you to leave instead of going and eating in the kitchen is just bizarre. Like, if you weren't okay with being quiet during dinner, how would you eating in dinner in the kitchen change that at all? It really sounds like this isn't like a religious practice or a specific form of respect and really is about control. And they think that if you won't accept their control, you need to be punished by eating alone in the kitchen, so you were rude to not accept your punishment!", "NTA-I would break up personally", "nta. who eats in complete silence at a table full of people? i\u2019d be weirded out, too.", "ESH except you. Your bf has to know that his family eating in silence is unusual. I am old, conservative and Christian and I have never heard of this.  He should have warned you.

And once his parents suggested you should eat by yourself in the other room, he should have stood up for you. I don't blame you for leaving.", "INFO: have you and your boyfriend talked about why he didn't warn you about this tradition? I mean... presumably he's eaten with you and knows you talk during meals right?", "NTA, this is very weird and I\u2019m supposing a them thing not a cultural thing. I grew up in a family with 5 siblings, a quiet meal just doesn\u2019t happen. It would be very odd, then to be so rude to guests in your home? The whole thing is over the top imo", "NTA.  Because their non talking at all at the table rule, is so far from the norm, your BF should have told you what to expect at dinner. I hope you explained your understanding of that phrase and that other people you know do not take it so very strict.  Instead of saying \"Shhh\" when it was clear you weren't on the same page as them, either parent could have explained \"we don't talk at the table here\" but I guess that would have been too many words.", "NTA I would have done the same thing but then lit into his parents that I was not a child and they are not to dictate their rules to me and if talking is disrespectful I would no longer be enjoying their company. So rude and disrespectful to you as a guest they were. And my boyfriend would have been not my boyfriend anymore. I would not abide by that. I can see a monsters or something because that\u2019s expected but to be reminded and scolded like a child would have pushed me to the edge. I definitely would have bounced too. Good on you OP stand your ground with your bf and his parents.", "NTA. Your bf should\u2019ve warned you what was expected for you prior to accepting the invitation.

How the heck were you supposed to know about their dinner table rules when no one explained it to you?  Your BF didn't even give you the courtesy of a heads up. \n\nIt almost seems like he set you up for this.", "Wow, NTA. This has nothing to do with being Christian or conservative.  All to do with crazy, super controlling nut jobs.    No way I'd marry into that.", "OP is definitely NTA, but her bf and his family are. I understand there might be rules and traditions one followed at dinner time but those should always relax when there's a guest attending. I would have never shushed a guest in my house, let alone twice; and I definitely wouldn't have \"threatened\" to send them to eat in the kitchen. WTF kind of cult did you walk into OP? You better run now while you're not more invested in this crazy relationship.", "He didn\u2019t think to warn you about this before dinner?", "Why the hell did BF not tell you this?

Are they Catholic? \n\nThe reason I ask is because there is an extremely old school Catholic tradition of having what is known as a \"silent supper\" on November 1st, All Saints Day. After a prayer, the rest of the meal is eaten in silence, to honor all the saints and martyrs. \n\nAs a traumatized ex Catholic, this is the only explanation I can think of. \n\nNTA regardless. Your boyfriend should have warned you beforehand. It's still weird AF.", "NTA. The fact that the parents chose to shush you like a child rather than anybody explaining to you that the expectation is to eat in silence is a massive red flag.

And my aunt and cousin lived with her forever and a day. My two brothers and parents tend to be talkative at the table as well. We sat down said grace, did what we where thankful for. I went to ask my brother a question and got told by my aunt \u201cthat we don\u2019t talk at the table\u201d I looked up like \ud83d\ude2e. She then told off my middle brother.

I don\u2019t think you were wrong for leaving as you\u2019re an adult and don\u2019t deserve to be scolded like a child. I\u2019d consider this a huge red flag for your relationship with your boyfriend too. Remember that this has been his benchmark for how marriage works. If he hasn\u2019t been displaying any controlling behavior yet, it\u2019s only a matter of time.", "NTA \n\nWhat's the point of inviting someone to dinner if you're not going to speak to them ???

You\u2019re NTA at all. \n\nDinner is family time where we get to talk about each others day and enjoy each other\u2019s company I thought?? He could have definitely warned you and said \u201coh hey, by the way, we don\u2019t speak at all during dinner\u201d \n\nAnd then thinking you\u2019re an asshole because you were trying to be kind and stuff like that.\n\nI personally think this relationship should be thrown in the trash but that\u2019s just me.", "NTA because nobody warned you. If you have household rules that are out of step with mainstream culture it's on you to explain to people. Complete silence at meals is super weird. I've never heard  of that before. \n\nIf you had been warned, you'd be an asshole, but you were blindsided.", "NTA. your boyfriend could\u2019ve told you about this before as it\u2019s clearly something his family partake in whist eating.

Not only would it be awkward, but no one explained things to you beforehand.", "NTA", "NTA are you sure they\u2019re Christians and not Trappist Monks?", "NTA, that\u2019s a weird ass family dynamic and you probably need to evaluate how that impacts your BF and his behavior towards you.

Obviously different culture but before my grandpa dated my grandma there was absolutely no drinks at the dinner table. Not even water. Some Mennonites we do this to slow down to eat our food and also dinner is viewed as special family time! Where you talk and engage with each other. When my grandpa did date my grandma that\u2019s when THEY made an exception to their original rule and allowed drinks at the table but still you wouldn\u2019t get up until everyone else is done.

The fact that the bf didn\u2019t warn her that his family had weird rules, and then doubled down by telling her she should have just followed them, tells me he probably internalized other of his parents\u2019 rules and beliefs that he fully intends to subject her to, no questions asked.", "Agreed. Their house or not, guests are to be respected too. The BF should have given a warning ahead of time and parents could have been a little more forgiving/understanding.\n\nIt sounds to me like the Father is just a controlling asshole.\n\nThat said, being completely silent for the duration of a meal is completely foreign to me. Like, meal time is and should be a social event.", "As a Christian, it ain\u2019t that. We never did that. Always talked after prayer. Even Jesus talked while breaking bread. This family has just a strange rule.", ">Do they shush everyone who eats with them or do expect Op to follow this controlling behavior?\n\nMy mum lived in a convent for a couple of years after she finished school. Her family were extremely devout and sent all their kids to the church for a year or 2 of service after school. My aunt has remained with the church ever since. \n\nApparently this is a thing in some of the catholic church. The convent banned all forms of speech above a whisper during meals and absolutely no chatter was allowed at all. Basically, if you didn't have a reason to speak then you had to keep your mouth shut all they way through the meal and clean up afterwards. Once all that was out of the way everyone would let it all out at once and then about an hour before lights out they would have to do silent reflection in their rooms and they would get into trouble of they fell asleep during reflection time. \n\nLuckily, my mum hated this and raised us around a happy dinner table.", "I probably would\u2019ve eaten in the kitchen, just manically laughing so they could hear me. Like loud enough that I would NEVER be invited back again.", ">The only thing I knew about them is that they\u2019re conservative and christians but lovely people.\n\nExactly lmao. I read this and was like famous last words.", "These are the kind of people who would have made good Nazis.", "Almost sounds like a weird fucking cult.", "Yes! Thank you! That\u2019s actually what I was originally going to say in my comment, but thought it might be a bit extreme. But I totally agree that it has major cult vibes.", "Shushing her is an intentional act.", "Yep the fact that he didn't warn her is really bad", "Or dumped him at the dinner table so he couldn\u2019t reply", "She shouldn't have needed to ask. She should have been informed.", "I've told prospective partners that they must agree to always having the TV or radio on, or else we must eat in loud environments, or else it will never work out. Team Misophonia, unite! Let us never date OP's bf's family.", "Oh they\u2019d never be unsupervised around my children.  And I\u2019d seriously question ever having kids with the bf, at least until I was sure he wasn\u2019t going to physically abuse them.  Agreed, if this is how they treat a guest at dinner I\u2019d hate to see what happens behind closed doors if you break a random odd rule.  Bf is brainwashed to think they\u2019re normal. \n\nThat dinner scene OP described belongs in a creepy horror cult movie.", "I also wondered what if you wanted someone to pass something?  I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s not allowed, no seconds, and you probably have to finish your plate whether you are even hungry or not. Pretty sure sign language at the table would have gotten you beaten with a belt as a child there.  These people are messed up.   (I live in the Bible Belt and have never met anyone this over the top religious.  But they\u2019re pretty much all Spare the rod spoil the child people.)", "Hello, darkness, my old friend", "I grew up with conservative Christian cult parents and this sounds way too familiar. They believed that girls shouldn\u2019t be involved with politics, so for the first 17 years of my life I was literally required to sit with my back to the TV every night at dinner while the rest of the family watched the news. No talking, just watching.", "And May your mouth not open", "This comment wins the internet today imo", "Have you seen Candy on Hulu? She didn\u2019t like being Shushed.", "I suffer from this and I've even annoyed myself at the dinner table \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80", "I don\u2019t have misophonia but the sound of someone chewing with their mouth open drives me nuts. It\u2019s disgusting.", "I've come to talk with you again", "Lmao I totally did and didn't notice until you said it. I thought something looked wrong. Not gonna edit it everyone can see my shame.", "I immediately thought this. Like will everyone be expected to stay silent? This is honestly so weird to me.", "> and nobody shuts the fuck up at the dinner table.\n\nThat's how you can tell the food is <really> good - it's the only time it's quiet!", "Are you my sister? That is exactly what my sister would do. Then look sly and blame the dog", "This is why you always keep one chambered when meeting your SOs family.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Because a vision softly creeping", "Idk where OP is from but it also sounds like this behavior is bizarre for her own culture", "Honestly that's how you really know that shit is good. Kitchen parties and dinner tables are loud spaces I cant even fathom having dinner with my family in complete and absolute silence", "Thank you for explaining! This seems like a hyper-religious extension of that practice. Religious folks who disconnect themselves enough from society can take a norm and mutate it in this way. I've seen it in the states with other cultural norms. Like as soon as you start doing \"everything for the glory of God,\" it can be taken to the extreme of table manners suddenly become family doctrine"]}
