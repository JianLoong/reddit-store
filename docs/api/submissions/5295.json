Please take care of yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt's sad to let go of someone that you've been friends with for so long, but friends drift apart with time.

Tell her everything, how you feel, how does she seems to not care about your problems. And if she does not understand it or does not care about you - that's not a friendship, she is literally just using you as a venting tool.\n\nBut if you feel that you have talked about it enough times and nothing changes, you have to move on from it as it is toxic friendship which does not benefit you in any way or form.", "NTA friendship doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re allowed to use someone as a non stop emotional dumping ground. It\u2019s nice to vent to your friends, but there is a limit when it stops being venting and it becomes an emotional drain. Also the fact that she can\u2019t be bothered to reciprocate and inquire about you and how you\u2019re doing demonstrates a glaring lack of empathy. You will start to realize that when a friendship requires you giving waaaaay more than you\u2019re getting, it isn\u2019t worth it to continue the friendship. This isn\u2019t to say that friendships needs to be treated as transactional, but it is a series of exchanges between two people. If those exchanges are leaving you feeling net negative, then they don\u2019t seem worthwhile to sustain for your own sake.", "NTA - you aren't their therapist. That's that. And sometimes friendships are outgrown - it's natural.", "Ask her to repeat her point about friends being there for each other and let that sit for a minute.

Friends absolutely should be there for each other, but that's literally why you're not willing to be there for her anymore - she did not behave like your friend and give you the respect and support that she came to feel entitled to from you. It sounds like this friendship has run its course and letting it go is the healthiest thing for you right now.", "NTA.\n\nYes, friends are supposed to be there for each other, and she's not there for you. She's there to emotion-dump without helping in return. Especially now that she knows that you need space, her reaction isn't to apologize and ask you if you're okay, it's just anger and entitlement.\n\nDon't worry, I'm sure she'll find someone else to complain to about that!", "Nta. Friendships evolve. Sometimes people outgrow each other. That's what you feel here. Drop her, block her number & work on yourself.", "You are NTA!  She\u2019s an emotional vampire. Do not invite her into your life anymore. \nYou\u2019ve already explained it to her, now follow through and work on your own mental health.", "NTA, I was in the same boat. I left the relationship because of her neediness. And you know what? She rarely asked how I was doing.", "Info: Did you discuss the venting and insensitivity towards you diagnosis before ending the friendship?", "OP, you're also allowed to \"cancel\" toxic family from your life. So if she thinks you're family, family is there for you when you need them and not just there to only get help from you giving you nothing. Your friendship sounds like the relationship between a tick and a cow. She being the parasite. Work on your mental health and learn to uphold whatever boundaries you put in place. NTA.", "Other friends had pointed all of this out but I hadn't directly said anything before ending the friendship.", "NTA for exiting a friendship that was draining you, particularly given your own struggles. The way you ended it could\u2019ve used some work, though. By your own admission it was a 20 year otherwise \u201cincredible\u201d friendship. That probably deserved a direct conversation with you. Other friends might\u2019ve pointed out the issue, but they aren\u2019t you. Good luck.", "NTA.  Friendship is 2-sided.  To me, she has what I call \"Martyr Syndrome\" - her drama and misery has to be the center of everyone around her.    I dumped two 30+ year friends for the same reason and I don't feel guilty at all.  Her life consists of misery and she wants you to be miserable, too.  If she can't have happiness, neither can you.  Find a better friend and don't feel guilty!!!!", "She is or was your friend. Figure it out. Maybe it\u2019s best to move on.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were her therapist, not her friend.  If she is not willing to give, she cannot expect to take.", "NTA, I tried to gently ease out of a similar (right down to being close for 20 years) best friendship but she wouldn\u2019t even let me go quietly. So I completely cut her off and haven\u2019t missed her even for a moment in the past five years since then. She was exhausting.", "NTA - if friends are supposed to be there for eachother why isn\u2019t she there for you when you\u2019re struggling with depression? Her friendship is one side and it benefits her while having no regard for you. Cut this person lose, focus on your mental health.", "NTA, she is 'emotionally dumping' on you without allowing you to do the same in return. \n\nI have a lot of trauma and would 'trauma dump' on friends because I just didn't understand how to be a friend. I've met a wonderful friend group and we are honest with each other but we do it with kindness. I've addressed how not to do that with my therapist and be a better friend because I care about them. \n\nWhen you set a boundary with your friend, her first response is to attack you and that's not a good sign. \n\nSince you've been friends so long, if you want to, just talk with her and tell her how it feels to be dumped on like that every day without her taking your depression into consideration and even blows you off about it. \n\nPersonally, I don't think she will care but if you want more closure, it's worth it. I hope your depression gets better OP, I've been in some really dark places, people like your 'friend' don't help. You deserve friends who care about you as well.", "NTA \n\nFriends are supposed to be there for each other but it has to go both ways. It's not ok for you to sacrifice your own mental health and well being for the benefit of someone else. Be there for yourself first, it's ok to protect your own energy. And who knows, in the future you might be able to resume some sort of a modified friendship.", "nta, its OKAY to outgrow people.", "NTA OP. You were looking out for your own mental health and when you confided in her about it, she minimized it and cast it aside. What you did was brave and took real strength so you should be proud of yourself. \n\nToxic friends always start toxic, but the doses are so small at first it is hard to notice. Only over time does the toxicity build up. Well done in being the antidote to the toxicity.", "Agreed. I've had friends (& family) interrupt me mid sentence, repeatedly, because they felt what they had to say was more important & they all became shocked when I just stopped talking to them all together (after multiple times). Cut the toxic parrots out of your life that just want to talk about themselves but never listen to a word you say.", "Yes, I tried a direct conversation and it just turned into an argument. Toxic people aren\u2019t the type you can just talk it out with.", "If you tried to talk to her about the issues before ending it, then you did what you could. Relationships run their course. Best of luck.", "NTA. I had to cut off someone I considered my best friend of 10 years because of how one-sided it became. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was her telling me my depression was getting in the way of being a good friend to her and I needed therapy so I could be more present for her needs. \n\nThat was the moment it clicked for me, she didn\u2019t care about me. She needed me to validate her choices and existence. I was done. \n\n~5 years later, I am so much better off. You have to choose yourself first, no one else will.", "NTA\n\nHow is it you are supposed to have time for her problems but she can't manage time for yours.\n\nIt is entirely ok to outgrow friends.\n\nSaying about how people are in your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime.", "NTA.  Shes dense and self absorbed.", "NTA, my dude. I ask my friends if they can handle my emotional dumping and/or everyday rants before I start in and they do the same for me. If she can't even bother to ask if you're up to listening to her rant/vent, she's the one being a bad friend.\n\nAlso, her pointing out that y'all are more like sisters? That shit don't fly.  My actual sister emotionally dumps on me without asking if I am willing and able to listen and it has led to me letting her go to voicemail more often than not.", "Your friend is absolutely right: friends are supposed to be there for each other. But when was she there for you? Never, not once and she dismissed your admission of struggle with depression. That is just a huge NO that shows she is not your friend. She uses you as an emotional dump without ever reciprocating when you need her. You are NTA, please don't feel guilty about cutting this one sided relationship off because I suspect it was never really a friendship and she always, or at least most of the time, took advantage of you. Cut her out completely and focus on your healing. You will eventually find the right people for the next chapter of your life because we do outgrow people and even longtime friendships don't last forever, nor should they if they are toxic.", "Friends are supposed to be there for one another but in her case it's a one-way street. You are not her friend. You are her one-way stress dump. There is a reason you are relieved to end this so-called friendship. She gives nothing back, NTA.", "NTA.  You should have told her you can\u2019t be her therapist, that her emotional dumping on you stresses you further than you are already stressed and that her behavior is not fair to you.", "NTA\n\nThis", "NTA you\u2019re struggling with depression and she shrugs it off? You\u2019re right for prioritising yourself. That friendship seems very one sided anyways.", "Do not feel guilty. I had to cut off a 30 year friendship because she also seemed to attract drama, seemed to always have the worst luck. I was a doormat, she dumped her problems on me. For decades, I  listened to her, was there for her, until she attacked me for being a bad friend because I didn't want to listen to her rehash a romantic relationship that she had 8 years earlier. Don't do what I did.", "Would a symptom of that also be believing that your suffering cannot compare to theirs?"]}
