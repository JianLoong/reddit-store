I also ask that you please read the text before rushing to judgement, I\u2019ve seen too many posts where verdicts were clearly made off title alone. I also need to say that my fianc\u00e9 and I have an amazing relationship, this is the first real hiccup we\u2019ve had.\n\nMy (29M) fianc\u00e9 (27F) and I have been living together for 4 years. A piece of relevant info for later on: we share a car. We both have roughly an equal commuting distance. She takes the car every day, and until this situation unfolded, I had been taking public transportation\n\nI handle all of the cooking for dinner. Up until recently, we\u2019ve both done whatever for lunch. About 4 months ago, she decided she wanted to start cooking me lunches to take to work. She\u2019d make two portions, bringing one for herself and letting me have the other. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of her cooking at all. She\u2019s not a bad cook, my palate is just simply not in alignment with her style. \n\nOne day, after taking the meal out of the communal fridge at work, I let out an audible sigh. My friend/coworker asked me what was wrong. Instead of admitting I dislike my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cooking, I lied and said I bring leftovers to work and was getting tired of it. My friend (I\u2019ll call him David from now on) took a liking to it. David drives to work, and I\u2019m a bit out of the way for him. So I had an idea, I offered to let David have my \u201cleftovers\u201d every day, in exchange for him driving me to and from work. It was a win-win, he got free lunch every day, I got to save on transportation.\n\nThe problem came when David hung out at our apartment one day. He made a comment to my fianc\u00e9e about \u201cloving my leftovers,\u201d to which I could see she was visibly confused. Once David left, she asked me what he meant by \u201cleftovers for lunch.\u201d I tried to deflect and stall as much as I could, but she eventually got it out of me.\n\nShe blew up on me, asking how I could possibly do something \u201cso cruel.\u201d (I think cruel is a ridiculous word in this context, I\u2019ll concede the point though) I explained to her that I was saving money on transportation which would allow us to add a little more to savings, she hated that response. I told her that I did all the dinner cooking, so it evened out. She suggested she stop making David lunches, and instead we split dinner duties. That\u2019s when I messed up and confessed I don\u2019t like her cooking, and she went silent.\n\nIt\u2019s been three days, and she hasn\u2019t said anything to me other than good morning, good night, and other banalities.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1688070974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mfr9j/aita_for_trading_my_fianc\u00e9s_lunches_for_rides_to/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have communicated your feelings much earlier and found common ground as to what you two like.  Of course she is blindsided, hurt, and pissed off.", "YTA for lying to your fianc\u00e9 (and to a lesser extent, your coworker). Next time, try to have an upfront and honest conversation with her.\n\nThat said, I think this was a masterful sentence:\n\n>She\u2019s not a bad cook, my palate is just simply not in alignment with her style", "YTA more because you seem to have a pattern about deceitful over small things that could be handled very differently. \n\nYou said it\u2019s not her cooking you don\u2019t like but your palate is different than hers. After four years together, is she not aware of your food likes and dislikes, and did you ever attempt to have a conversation with her about this instead of just taking the food day after day and not wanting to eat it? There is a respectful way to have this convo. \n\nAnd then why didn\u2019t you tell your coworker the truth? It\u2019s weird that you felt the need to lie and call them leftovers. Why didn\u2019t you just say that your girlfriend was very sweet to make your lunch every day but it\u2019s just not food that you are into, then, if you did do the trade off for rides you wouldn\u2019t have ended up in that weird situation where you got caught in a bizarre white lie that you really never needed to tell.", "YTA. If you don't like your fiance's cooking but also never communicated that to her, then she has no chance to make food which you would like to eat.\n\nTALK to your fiance - better to be (painfully) honest upfront than to lie by omission for months.", "YTA for being so sneaky about this whole situation. Time to apologize and learn to communicate with your fianc\u00e9.", "INFO: when you give your co-worker your lunch, do you eat anything at all?  Because if you are buying lunch then your statement about saving money is complete bullshit and you know it.  Not only are you spending money on the food that you give to your co-worker but now you're double dipping by buying yourself a second meal.  Exactly HOW is that saving money?", "Good god, OP. Of course you\u2019re the asshole.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is taking time to make you lunch. And you\u2019re literally giving it away and lying about it.", "So here's the thing:\n\nIt truly does not matter if everyone on Reddit exonerated you here, bc your partner thinks you're the AH. Coming and asking was a mistake for the same reason hiding you didn't like your partner's cooking was a mistake...\n\nYou're avoiding potential conflict to an absurd degree, which is not just preventing y'all from resolving issues but actively preventing growth in your relationship\n\nPut your partner's feelings first, accept that you hurt her. Talk to her & make it up to her\n\nEveryone else's opinion here is just noise", "Soft yta.. I think you should have just been real about disliking her cooking from the start. You should be comfortable saying those things if you've been together for 4 years. She doesn't need to give you the silent treatment for it though, it's not like you were trading dirty secrets or worse, plus she gets the car all the time, and you don't. It's very workable but takes communication.", "YTA. Grow up and learn to have tough conversations.   Shes been wasting food and effort because you're passive.", "YTA. All you had to do was communicate with her. You had four years to tell her.", "Good night, OP.", "YTA. You were being sneaky because you knew it was messed up. You lied to your fianc\u00e9, you lied to your coworker, and then you try to lie again by saying \u201cyou are saving on the commute\u201d. I say this is a lie because if you aren\u2019t eating a lunch from home every day, what are you eating for lunch? Takeout? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s WAY more expensive than what you would pay for public transportation.", "My man, your heart is in the right place, but you kind of screwed the pooch by not communicating up front with your fiance. Like, I get what you were doing because it can be hard to voice your concerns when someone's doing something for you out of love, but in your effort to not be the bad guy...you kind of became the bad guy :( But also, it feels like you already know YTA here.\n\nEveryone's been there and it sucks.\n\nYou could have saved yourself a ton of grief by saying something as simple as \"Hey, I really appreciate you making me lunch, it means a lot to me! Would it be alright if we talk about and/or brainstorm some of the recipes?\"\n\nYou acknowledge the labor, you acknowledge the love, and you voice your concerns. \n\nBest of luck!", "YTA. If you like food prepared differently, different seasonings, or prefer to have certain things for lunch just say so. Instead you wasted her time preparing and packing food. I doubt she would have bothered if she knew she was feeding your coworker.", "LMAO this played out in my head like a sitcom episode. It\u2019s probably gonna end you being TA anyways but just to try and get some sympathy for you I\u2019m gonna go INFO: how did you express to her you didn\u2019t like her cooking? Sounds like it could\u2019ve been extra rude in the midst of an argument that was already setup for a nail in the coffin. Also, common sense would\u2019ve had you coming clean to your coworker before inviting them in! I\u2019m laughing writing this because i don\u2019t understand how that thought didn\u2019t occur to you, but I digress. YTA for now, all I can say is that I agree \u201ccruel\u201d is an overstatement, and 3 days is a ridiculous silent treatment if you\u2019re going to get married. I can\u2019t stress that enough. Doesn\u2019t matter what happened, this situation is not enough to act like a child for 3 days over (you\u2019re still the asshole just so we\u2019re clear though).", "Well, YTA to her, and that's what really matters here.

I give you props for making a beneficial trade. The problem was that it was build on dishonesty and a lack of transparency. I, too, have a husband who has a very different palette than mine. I gratefully eat everything he cooks for me EVEN THOUGH MOST OF IT DOESN\u2019T APPEAL TO MY TASTES because I am appreciative of his efforts and grateful not to have to cook. By contrast, my husband initially made his dislike of my preferences known. I found it hurtful and unappreciative. We still have distinct tastes. Sometimes, we cook to our individual tastes knowing it doesn\u2019t appeal to the other. Sometimes we modify our cooking to meet in the middle. But my husband has eventually come to see that it isn\u2019t all about him. It\u2019s about the shared labor, the effort and simple courtesy. \n\nApologize to your wife. Tell her you\u2019ve really appreciated her thoughtfulness even though you\u2019ve been trading the meals. It\u2019s okay to say your tastes are different than hers, but that\u2019s something distinct from \u201cnot liking her cooking\u201d. Be sure to tell her a few meals you really enjoy. And then give her helpful specifics about what makes a meal enjoyable to you versus not. Then\u2014suck it up and eat her meals, or go back to making your own.", "Yta. It's not hard to say hey I don't like this. I do the majority of the cooking at our place. There have been countless times over the last 20 years where one of us have gone this is shit, wont be making that again. Yes sometimes feelings can be hurt but overall it's better to say something sooner rather than later.

It happens we hot over it", "Yeah, show some YouTube videos on simple dishes.", "What's wrong with this sentence? She might be cooking  vegan women's food (hummus, chia, beet and other seeds and vegetables mixed together to feel healthy) while he prefers traditional food.", "I agree.  It might make sense on paper (not accounting for factors like if the fianc\u00e9 was trying to support healthy habits with a homemade lunch) but lying about it, even to the coworker, was a jerk move.  \n\nThe coworker may not have been comfortable with this arrangement had he known the truth.  It should\u2019ve been his choice to make and could\u2019ve prevented him stepping on this landmine in OP\u2019s home.

YTA", "So when is the right time to hurt her feelings? From the get go telling her that he doesnt like her cooking or now, that he doesn't like her cooking?  Instead of hurting her feelings back then he started cooking dinner, to spare her feelings. She decided to start making his lunch he didn't ask for it. So what should he do? Tell her that he doesn't like her food or throw it away every day to spare her feelings?", "I started skipping lunch, on occasion I\u2019ll grab something cheap from a street vendor. All in all it comes out way less than what the monthly transportation cost would be", "She's all feeling good about making his lunch. Does he take that away from her?  Now she know's that he doesnt like her cooking, what does she do next to give herself those feel good moments?  All the times he choked down her cooking and didn't say a word so she could feel good about doing something for her man. Eating her cooking isn't that one of those white lies that we tell to spare a persons feelings?", "It sounds like she's withdrawn but not giving him the silent treatment. She just found out that he's been lying very well to her for for 4 months about the lunches, and years about liking her cooking, instead of having a conversation with her. I'd be hurt and scared that he was lying about other things and questioning whether we were really in a position to get married if he wasn't willing to work through something as simple as this. Communication takes 2 people and honesty. If she's deliberately punishing him she's an AH, that's not ok. If she's keeping things surface level while processing, I feel like it's fair for her to take some time for that.", "this was my first thought too. made me think of Home Imrovement or Everybody Loves Raymond. it's funny but kinda sad. your moral compass is the same as a 90s sitcom dad, pretty automatic YTA.", "Al Bundy giving away Pegs food.
