If it was just alcohol or other substances she had asked you all not to consume, I\u2019d probably say N A H, because she has the right to have that boundary at her birthday party and you have the right to not go. But telling you all what you can and cannot eat? Nope, that\u2019s crazy!", "NTA\n\nShe changed the invite requirements the next day. You\u2019re respecting her boundaries. It would be nice if she respected yours. If it had just been because she didn\u2019t want alcohol there it would be different. But going to a restaurant and not being allowed to order specific food is way too much to expect from everyone.", "NTA. She made her position clear.

You were absolutely respectful and she has nothing to complain about. \n\nIf she wants to live her life by those strictures, she can, but she has to live with the fact some people won\u2019t want to socialize with her. \n\nThere are also shades here of \u201cI think homosexuality is wrong, so LGBT people shouldn\u2019t have rights\u201d (or whatever you want to replace homosexuality and LGBT with). \n\nNTA\n\nETA: I\u2019m unaware of any pescatarian religions, but Seventh Day Adventists abstain from all meat and Coptic Christians go vegan two days/week.", "NTA.

If she had made all of her rules clear in the initial invite and you still RSVP\u2019d yes, then you would be wrong.  But she kept everyone in the dark because she knew she would get some \u201cno thanks\u201d and she wanted people to come.

She should be aware that changing the rules would change the participation.", "NTA \n\nYou told her nicely, to her face, as soon as you knew, that you no longer wanted to attend out of respect for your differences (and also *your health*)\n\nShe's the one with the trauma to work through and it's unfair of her to *demand* people acommodate that, especially when she wasn't honest and upfront about her expectations from the get-go.\n\nAlso looking into being pescatarian due to a religion, couldn't find anything, so you might have to ask directly to find out.", "NAH.\n\nShe has the right to enforce boundaries at her party (particularly about substances), and you have the right to refuse to attend once informed.\nShe probably should have made her expectations clear on the invitation, however. \n\nYou had a very valid, medical reason to decline based on your shellfish allergy and her desire for a \"pescatarian meal\". I think using that as your reason for rescinding your attendance may have gone over better, instead of using religion and beliefs/values as the reason.\n\nJumping off of the idea of beliefs and values, in my opinion, showing up at a work acquaintance's birthday celebration with the intent on letting loose using substances...it seems presumptive. Getting crossfaded at a birthday dinner of someone you aren't super close with isn't necessarily the right time or place, even if this is your first night off in a while. \n\n It's probably for the best that you don't go. Obviously send your regrets and a gift if you'd like, and do your own thing with your night off instead.", "NTA.  You did let her know in advance that you weren't coming.

If not, then it\u2019s not okay to tell people that they have to order specific things.", "NTA at all.

If anything, it would be the one evening in MONTHS that Op has an occasion to indulge in alcohol and drugs (unless of course she does those things on a daily basis).

I kinda glossed over that because there are usually a few vegetarian options as well, it's not like she'd be forced to order seafood at all, but that could work as a polite way of bowing out!", "NTA.\n\nThe drugs and alcohol thing I get but you\u2019re within your rights to take a pass on those grounds.\n\nWith the food it would have been one thing if she had chosen a pescatarian restaurant. If you get invited out for a Muslim\u2019s birthday, expect a Halal restaurant. If you\u2019re invited out for a Jew\u2019s birthday, expect Kosher, etc.\n\nBut inviting people to a restaurant and telling them what they can and cannot order with their own money because of your religion is inexcusably rude. Decent religious people, regardless of their particular faith, know it\u2019s wrong to impose their beliefs on others.

This is a one time ask, and it seems she was respectful in asking. Sure she could, and should have, included those requests in the initial invitation, but it's not some crazy ask. You can absolutely order delicious food that aligns with her diet, so let's not pretend she's asking you to come out for a night of cold gruel and muddy water. I don't abide by any dietary restrictions, but some of my favorite dishes are vegetarian. \n\nAlso, your allergy excuse is pretty thin. I guess you never eat out anywhere that sells shellfish?

And having a boring, shitty meal (which is what salad is if salad is the only option) is *definitely* not fun.\n\nI'm going to assume that the pescetarian didn't pick a place where salad is the best veggie option though...\n\nWith that assumption in mind, OP still has a point. \n\n>So going to that same restaurant with that same surrounding fish but eating chicken is totally fine\n\nYep. Even if OP orders vegetarian...the rest of the table won't. So, no matter what OP does, they are going to be in close proximity to people ordering seafood. And the risk of this is much, *much* higher because seafood is the only acceptable meat option than it would be if meat was an option. If eating chicken/beef/pork was okay, it's much less likely that the rest of the table would opt for seafood.\n\nif you actually read OP's post, it's very clear that the refusal because they couldn't use intoxicants AND didn't want to take the risk of being around their allergen.\n\nSo yeah, it isn't great that OP seems to have substance use issues. **But OP is also completely right to recognize that this dinner sounds like an unsafe disaster too.** And that sounds extremely not fun.\n\nEdit: added quotes", "YTA, instead of doing that, you could have just said \"hey im allergic to shellfish, is it ok for me to choose smth else to eat?\".
