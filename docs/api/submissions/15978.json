I'm sure of it, I saw it clearly. It's not a situation where she didn't saw it. She read it and then asked if we have contactless payment. Some of you suggested that she might have wanted to check if the sign was still up to date. \n\nAlso, this got asked a lot : Yeah, she spoke the language written on the sign and understood it\n\nI know we should take contactless payment at the store.

Contactless payment is super common at this point so people often don\u2019t bring their card with them making this a common question.

The amount of \"city\" people who asked us if we had running water was ridiculous. We make food, of course we have running water.

I don't know anyone whose feelings wouldn't be hurt by that. \n\nAs you note yourself, she read the sign and clearly understood it. She wasn't asking you  because she was stupid. She was asking you to CONFIRM what the sign said . . . because sometimes stores have old signs up that are outdated, or that they haven't gotten around to removing. That's all she wanted, was confirmation that the sign was in fact correct and up-to-date, and that you hadn't perhaps recently updated your payment systems and absentmindedly left an old sign still up. And your response to her request for confirmation was to insinuate that she was clueless. Except she wasn't. You were just rude to her.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, I don't know if this applies to you, but many of us who are autistic have what is known as \"flat affect\" . . . our intent and mood doesn't always translate to our facial expressions or voice, and we can come across as far more serious or angry than we intend. Happens to me all the time - I can be in a great mood and feeling friendly and playful, and people read me as angry and annoyed because my intent does not translate well to my voice/expression. So you may not have come across as \"joking\" to her as you intended, you may have just seemed snarky.", "NTA. People just don't read. I remember when I worked in dorms during move in there was a moving cart. There were signs both on it and next to it saying it wasn't a trash can. It was full of trash, of course.", "NTA since it sounds like she did read the sign but didn\u2019t like the answer", "NTA I would love to have someone joke around with me if I made that comment or something, it is nice to go out in public and someone can joke around", "YTA, you work in customer service, you have to deal with dumb people kindly, it is a part of the job\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I have worked in customer service for 10 years, I agree it is annoying, but you learn quickly that there is no such thing as common sense", "NTA, see I would have taken your comment as a joke, laughed and probably tried to get a dig in at you (for fun) but thats because most people have the ability to banter back. She didnt, which shows her lack of social interactions, and she took it bad, because she wasn\u2019t swtiched on enough to come back at you. Mate, I would have said the same thing!", "I call it \"hidden in plain sight.\" it is right in front of you, but you don't see it, or it just doesn't register", "It's an unfortunate reality of working in the service industry. It's like when I wore a shirt with the store's name on it and customers still asked if I worked there. Or the whole, \"If it doesn't scan the first time, it means I get it for free, right?\" Heard that a thousand times. My bosses would have had my head if I said something snarky back.", "NAH.", "NTA. She was embarrassed for asking a rhetorical question and nobody was amused.", "NTA, as an IT support person, the urge to say stuff like this is strong.", "People get confused when you put things in the negative.  It would be better to have your sign say something like   PAY BY CASH OR CHECK ONLY  and keep the sign looking nice.  If the sign is ratty, they may think it just hasn't been changed.  It won't eliminate the idiots but will hopefully help", "Nta- people are totally oblivious. I work in retail and the amount of times people don\u2019t read things, repeatedly ask the same questions and don\u2019t listen to the answers, and overall just ask the dumbest questions ever is mind boggling. I work in a wine tasting room and the the biggest question I get is \u201cdo you serve wine?\u201d  \n\nNope, no wine at a winery, just a wonderful 2020 Pepsi aged in an oak barrel. And then the saddest part is that people will believe it. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know you aged Pepsi in oak barrels.\u201d \n\nYou almost have to joke with these kinds of people or just go bat shit crazy.", "NAH. Sounds like two people at the end of their ropes in different ways bumping into each other imo. You were sick of being asked and she was probably in a sensitive place for whatever reason even though you weren't mean about it. Maybe she wasn't even hurt, just a quiet person generally. I wouldn't let it keep worrying you.", "Exactly and when you tell them the policies stop asking a million reasons why. We didn\u2019t have a store policy saying you can pinch people so let it go or shop at a different establishment if you really don\u2019t like the store.", "10/10", "Every retail workers dream tbh lol", "When I worked a customer service job and people made this comment to me I'd say \"it's probably a good idea that machines all work a bit differently, this way we can all pay attention to the transaction at hand instead of just throwing our money around all Willy nilly\"", "NTA. Where I live a lot of places don\u2019t have contactless payment. Sounds like all these customers are entitled af. Your comment wasn\u2019t rude, it was just blunt (and rather funny too).", "Maybe she was just making conversation?", "Customers are just too ignorant to understand what the sign says I guess.  No, You are NTAH.", "NTA but also not really professional behavior. I\u2019m the same way and when I say something like that I also laugh and apologize and tack on that I think I\u2019m hilarious but sometimes I\u2019m the only one.  Basically saying I\u2019m trying to be funny and I\u2019m sorry if I suck at it.", "NTA I kinda wonder if you guys would be better off saying only cash or credit accepted though. The other one seems to be confusing a lot of people.", "NTA. Maybe kinda passive-aggressive, but I have worked in customer service so I know you'd usually be tempted to go more aggressive-aggressive. This is the kind of thing that as a customer, I'd forget within ten minutes. You're good.", "That\u2019s the sort of joke you can make to someone you know, but sometimes with strangers it can come off as passive aggressive. The customer must have just been having a bad day. NAH", "I in general don\u2019t have the best situational awareness (I\u2019m working on it,) so there\u2019s been once or twice where I missed a \u201ccash only\u201d sign or something. But when I got to the counter and they would tell me, I didn\u2019t get snippy at all. What I did was usually say \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry, my bad. Just give me an extra minute here.\u201d And then follow whatever policy I missed. Ain\u2019t the cashier\u2019s fault I have tunnel vision. NTA.", "This has been the norm for decades. My decade in retail (which started about 20 years ago) was full of similar stories. Hell, the original Clerks has a perfect scene. A woman holding up an item and asking, \"how much is this?\" when there are 20 signs behind her with arrows and flashing lights saying \"ALL ITEMS $4.99!\" People do NOT pay attention.", "Fr fr", "Nta. I work in retail as well, we still have plastic shields up from covid. We kept getting asked about opening times, so we taped pieces of paper that say the times in bright rainbow colours at head height, yet people still ask us.\n\nWe also give 2 year warranty and have signs legit everywhere stating so, and also don't read that and repeatedly ask.\n\nDon't you just love customers (:", "NTA. Sometimes the joke doesn't land. You were being light hearted about it.", "So I have worked as a hostess at different events.People either don't read the signs or think that the signs are a joke or just think it doesn't apply to them..At one of the events i worked at ,there was this pool filled with balls and there were signs everywere saying Do Not Jump In the Pool,not only that ,the worker there also warned people to not jump or they could hurt themselves..everyone jumped, like literally everyone.Guess what happened, a lady broke her ankle.Also there was this \"performance\" with intensive lights and loud noises..again there were signs warning people of this..Again all signs were ignored and a kid with epilepsy ended up having a seizure(the kid is fine).My friend and colleague on the other hand almost had a heart attack cause of this.\nGood times."]}
