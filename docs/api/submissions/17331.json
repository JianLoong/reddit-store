He needs to either make peace with what he has, or get a plan together to build the life he wants.

Why on Earth would you even WANT to diminish one of your children's accomplishments because his sibling hasn't found his niche yet? Some kids are late bloomers. Why would you not encourage Ed to be happy for his brother. Yes, college isn't everything for all folks. But, that still doesn't take away from John's accomplishment! Why are you not encouraging Ed to find his niche instead of trying to downplay and ultimately pit one bother against the other? Cause that's exactly where this is headed, along with John feeling like you really don't care what he does! You don't seem to care that John's resentment would grow because you are literally choosing one over the other.

Just because the other one threw in the towel doesnt mean one cant be celebrated.", "Wow YTA- Ed needs to learn that other people don\u2019t have to suppress their accomplishments to make him feel better.

What you are doing to your son is cruel and insensitive. If you want to help Ed, pay for therapy but don't sacrifice your son's happiness because your other son is jealous. You have some seriously messed up priorities and warped thinking.", "YTA\n\nI mean, part of me says this is where rock meets hard place. But the bigger part of me says that you\u2019re invalidating all of John\u2019s hard work to get himself to where he is, if you keep this up, and definitely if you don\u2019t attend his graduation. \n\nIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime thing. Something you should be there for, proudly watching your son take that stage. It should be an extremely happy time for him. But instead, he\u2019s going to have it tainted by the fact that his own father doesn\u2019t want to go. \n\nI get not wanting to hurt Ed. BUT, it seems you\u2019re okay with hurting his brother instead. Take your blinkers off and open your eyes. \n\nWhilst wanting to protect Ed, you\u2019re also mollycoddling him and everyone else is expected to walk on eggshells so as not to set him off. You\u2019re not really seeing things clearly here at all. All this soft soaping you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re (possibly inadvertently\u2014I can\u2019t speak to motive or intention) hurting John. \n\nWhen will you stop trying to soften the blow for Ed? When will John be allowed to speak proudly of his achievements? How far will you let this go? \n\nIf you keep going like this, you\u2019ll alienate John entirely. But at least then, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his brother seeing him succeed. Silver linings hey? /s", "YTA. And a big one at that. Do you plan on wrapping your son in a bubble for the rest of his life so he is never exposed to regret or disappointment?  There is nothing wrong with the fact that he dropped out of college. It just wasn\u2019t for him. But don\u2019t let his feelings about that negate the hard work and accomplishment of your other son. It doesn\u2019t mean one son is better than the other. It means they are different people experiencing different lives. As long as you encourage Ed to pursue what he likes and to become a responsible adult in his own right, then he should respect your EQUAL encouragement and pride in John.

If you enable this behavioral pattern, you're only softening the blow of reality on Ed, while also making John feel like all his hard work and accomplishments are meaningless in comparison to poor Ed. We are all responsible for our feelings, and if Ed is feeling that way, maybe he should focus on getting to understand why it bothers him that much, and reconcile with his decisions in order to move forward.
