She was married but her husband requested I handled everything bc my mother specifically requested I was the point of contact since my older siblings did not have a healthy relationship with my mom. My mom was a tough cookie but she loved all of us. After the malpractice she endured many health scares and I supported her in everything that I could, I was there for her physically, financially, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nWell 5 years later my mom passed away but prior to her passing she named me as sole beneficiary of her bank account and mentioned to me that she wanted to give money to certain ppl upon her passing (her siblings and her children for the benefit of her grandchildren)\u2026 well when she passed away I wanted to honor what she asked of me and gave everyone the amounts she had told me. My siblings disagreed, they said that it didn\u2019t matter what she wanted, she gave me everything and I should do what I want. I honored what she asked me to do and gave my siblings what she told me plus a tad more from my share and now my siblings don\u2019t speak to me bc they say I should\u2019ve just split everything even with them instead of giving to my moms siblings. Also they\u2019re upset bc I kept a larger share for myself.
