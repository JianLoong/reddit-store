It\u2019s super weird that your gf will tell you something specific almost like she\u2019s claiming to be uncomfortable, then tells you you are overreacting, and then you feel upset so you stop, and now you\u2019re the bad guy. She put you in a bad position either way. If you do get upset about this, it\u2019s \u201cshe\u2019s just a friend\ud83e\udd2a\u201d if you don\u2019t react at all, it\u2019s \u201cdo you not love me????\u201d A partner like this will do more and more things to get you to react. But bc she lives a boring life and there\u2019s no actual real danger, she resorts to shit like this. They want this big protective bf so they will progressively put themselves in harms way in an attempt to show you off. You can thank Twilight, and other shit with a toxic male lead, giving girls this ideation of a bad boy who\u2019s only nice to her\u2026", "NTA I beleive you\u2019re setting a boundary and you partner is crossing that, she doesn\u2019t have to be uncomfortable with the touching per se but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be considering this is you guys are dating and you\u2019d like for other people (even if it\u2019s the same gender) to not be touching her inappropriately. I just feel like she\u2019s trying to get a reaction out of you bcz idk why she would text that to you if she\u2019s fine with it, if she was uncomfortable I\u2019d understand why she would tell you. But beside that I also think you need to work on ur self esteem. I understand you might feel insecure and jealous at times but I wonder why you see yourself as replaceable in this relationship?", "Seems like you and your girlfriend have a pattern where you feel inadequate and she bolsters you.

Also, this is not something normal that girls do.", "NTA\n\nLets have it this way you have a gay homie that tried to be in a relationship with you and now is touching you in a sexual manner, its not really a fair comparision cus guys dont do that when we go out to party and get wasted but it could be considered sexual assault since they are grabbing you with sexual/erotic motives without your consent, she might not see it that way but her friend knows damn well what she was doing, but I do think that instead of ignoring her you should talk to her and try to make her understand your point in this situation and if that doesnt work its sad but maybe you should find someone else that understands and appreciates you from who you are", "Definitely NTA here\nShe comes to you ,tells you someone that had a thing for her touched her( already why would she think it\u2019s okay )\nN then she dismisses something so simple - your request to respect you n your relationship n tell her to back off\n+ u were being nice and respectful n u didn\u2019t wanna hurt her", "Info: is your girlfriend even bisexual?", "nta.  no girls do not do that and it's not normal.", "This is what is known as a shit test. Women will try to push men over the edge to get a reaction out of them, don't give her one. Next time, stop answering your phone and go out with your own guy friends. Remind her, that you do have value by having options, other than her. Yes, it may seem immature, but it's effective. She will not only respect you more, but she may even just invite the friend over one night, if you're into that sort of thing. ;)", "Just because her friend is a girl does not mean it can't be considered cheating, nor that you shouldn't feel threatened because of it. She needs to respect your boundaries and her jokingly mentioning it to you, while you have stated that you have issues with jealousy and feeling \"replaceable\" makes her the bad one here. NTA, feeling some type of way about this is completely normal. Her friend was making a move on her.", "Your gf is an AH", "NTA  If the other person had a romantic interest it would really be no different than if a guy did it who was also trying to get with her. A girl might do it once to be funny, to continue doing it and for your GF to continue to allow it, is cheating when she knows that the person touching her wants to bed her.

You\u2019re worried you\u2019ll come off as dry and disrespectful, which is actually very respectable. And I can completely sympathize with your worries on the situation, I would just recommend responding and letting them know how you\u2019re feeling, and then, waiting until your girlfriend is home so that you can discuss the matter with her in person with no one else around.", "Your insecurity is something I would recommend working on.
