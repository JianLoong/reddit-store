My boyfriend has had past girlfriends cheat on him so he also has some jealousy issues. It's something that we're working through as a couple and that he's addressing on his own.

Looks like you're both filled with insecurities. \n\nIf you value this relationship, communicate your issues calmly and be genuine. Explain that going forward, you don't wish for either of you to be uncomfortable. \n\nTry explaining privacy squares to your partner and her friends. It's super weird that the rejected friend keeps violating your partner, and she seems to want to utilize it instead of stopping it.

It's never fun to hear that word \"overreacting\" coz she'd feel differently if the roles were reversed.\n\nNow I don't agree with the ghosting part.

If she doesn't, yk what to do.", "NTA\n\nMy brother, this is not you being overly jealous.\nThis is not you overreacting.\nThis is super sus, almost would go as far as to say I think you have found the \"friend you don't need to worry about\".\n\nAsk your gf how she would feel if you had a friend, who had tried to get into a relationship with you before, and at a pool party was acting the way her friend was, how would she react to that?\nHer response will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nI mean like, letter by letter spell it out to her, in my experience that's the best way to deal with these types of things because frankly you have to remind people of basic empathy.\n\nI'm also willing to bet that your current gf has a lot to do with the way you see yourself if she is going to play games like this.\n\nAlso, if the friends are hassling you, do the same thing to them, \"what advice would you give her if I was letting someone who is obviously interested in me touch me like that and then belittling all of her concerns and my mates were texting her calling her insecure?\"", "Them doing it (the grabbing) is semi-weird. Her telling you might be cause she is trying to feed into your insecurities to make sure u won't leave her (due to her insecurities). I tell my bf all the time when a guy hits on me, cause he should know (not that it happens that often) but I never tell him about my friends, cause we do the exact same things when he is there (like flirting) and it's always for fun.\n\nIf she is mentioning it she knows there are feelings involved and she is telling you on purpose.", "Maybe your girlfriend is trying to get you into a 3way", "NTA.\n\nIt would be less uncomfortable for you if your gf was straight, but since she is bisexual as you mentioned below (by the way you should edit the post to give that info) it's nothing different than a guy friend touching her ass.\n\nAlso why is she texting you that if she was going to just dismiss your reaction anyway?", "NTA. She playing games with your feelings and knows this", "Idk everyone seems like the ass here. Y\u2019all need to break up and do a little growing. It doesn\u2019t sound like either of you are ready for a serious relationship if that is what this is supposed to be.

This a reasonable boundary and your partner isn\u2019t respecting it.", "NTA. If she was simply texting you and saying not to feel insecure that's one thing, involving friends and letting them message you treating you that way over a private issue is not okay, that's toxic. Also if she feels the need to mention someone there is grabbing her butt, male or female, she knows it's abnormal already and not just 'friends', otherwise she wouldn't've mentioned it.", "NTA. You mentioned your gf is bisexual so you're well within your rights to tell her to stop. This is kind of a red flag tbh. And op you need to stop the negative self talk because at the end of the day people treat you the way you treat yourself. I'd say speak to her and set out your boundaries hard and if that doesn't work do what feels right. good luck!", "NTA. Also, maybe I\u2019m not a traditional girl friend, but I have never grabbed my friend\u2019s ass or had a friend grab my ass? That\u2019s just weird in my opinion.", "I feel as though perhaps your girlfriend is feeling uncomfortable, and she is contacting you for reassurance. \n\nIf her friends are brushing off her discomfort she might just want someone to let her know that if she is really uncomfortable it's okay for her to set a firmer boundary, and generally be supportive of her (or perhaps help her to get out of the situation). She might not be getting that support from the other friends if they are busy laughing it off.

But I guess she\u2019d be cool with your gay male friends grabbing your ass and touching you inappropriately.", "Just got out of a two year relationship because of her guy friends not respecting the relationship but \"they listen and give sound advice\" so it kinda had to end right then and there especially after I had to \"force\" her to drop the guy friends and then she was emotionally unavailable.

That is a sexual assault.  It's a criminal act.", "I simply meant that you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not normal for ANY woman to touch each others butts or to be super feely. Obviously if it\u2019s not something that was discussed and okayed it\u2019s not okay! But I know quite a few women who are okay with slapping each others butts and they might kiss or whatever else. Again though, not even a high five is cool if the other person isn\u2019t okay with it", "No no! I meant that I know girls who are incredibly touchy feely and girls who don\u2019t like to be touched at all.

I have friends who wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with it, so none of us do anything like that with them and everyone is happy. The gf is obviously fine with it, so she is not being assaulted, she\u2019s just being an ass to her boyfriend by crossing his boundaries and then rubbing it in his face.\n\nStop minimizing actual sexual assault to argue your point.", "Yes, I can say that sexual assault is not normal.  Just like any other sexual crime. Stop trying to defend it just because you know some pervs.", "ESH. Being a jealous boyfriend isn\u2019t healthy and I would advise you to spend some time out of a relationship and in therapy to work on that. No amount of control you try to exert over a girl you\u2019re dating will keep her from cheating if that\u2019s what she wants to do. It\u2019s unhealthy for you to be that jealous all the time and it\u2019s unhealthy for your girl to be that controlled and it leads to an unbalanced relationship dynamic that is doomed to fail.\n\nAll that being said, your girlfriend knows you\u2019re jealous and is obviously trying to bring that out in you, probably because it boosts her own ego to know you\u2019re upset and jealous over her. It\u2019s rooted in making herself feel better about herself and she obviously does not care how what she\u2019s doing affects you. \n\nThis relationship isn\u2019t healthy. Get out of it. Spend some time single and working on your jealousy issues. Being in a relationship isn\u2019t worth sacrificing your mental health.

YTA.  \n\n\nFirstly, you need to work on your confidence.  If your default is jealousy because \"i know how easily replaceable i am\"  then you aren't ready for a relationship, because shit like this is going to come up from time to time, especially if it's long term.   \n\n\nSecondly, it's not inappropriate if she doesn't deem it inappropriate.  It's her body, it's not up to you to decide what is or isn't appropriate for her.  You can be uncomfortable with it, but you can't decide for her what she sees as acceptable.   \n\n\nLastly, you need to mature a bit.  Ignoring texts and phone calls is something a teenager does; it's a game.  You're subconsciously trying to make her feel bad/punish her for something you don't like.  That will land you nowhere but back into the world of single males. \n\nOverall, you're exhibiting narcissistic and territorial behavior that will get you nowhere in relationships.", "NTA.

I would leave that relationship as soon as I heard that because it is a giant red flag. If a girl kisses another girl in the club and the guy does not like that then that is cheating. Girls cannot assume that because it is a girl it is allowed to touch each others ass.

Therapy, non judgemental discussions about what triggers you, investigating what your role is in relationship issues. Not diverting blame here just that it takes 2 people.\n\nSome folks are grabby and open queer/non queer. I've seen friend groups who are handsy and others who aren't. As to what is 'normal\" you'd have to judge based on the people not some imaginary standard. Is it ok? Well that's a different question if the worries involved are ok with it? Then there's how the outside parties not involved feel about it...see where I'm going?\n\nLastly ask yourself an important question.
