My boyfriend has had past girlfriends cheat on him so he also has some jealousy issues. It's something that we're working through as a couple and that he's addressing on his own.

Looks like you're both filled with insecurities. \n\nIf you value this relationship, communicate your issues calmly and be genuine. Explain that going forward, you don't wish for either of you to be uncomfortable. \n\nTry explaining privacy squares to your partner and her friends. It's super weird that the rejected friend keeps violating your partner, and she seems to want to utilize it instead of stopping it.

It's never fun to hear that word \"overreacting\" coz she'd feel differently if the roles were reversed.\n\nNow I don't agree with the ghosting part. That's never healthy for any relationship, communicate your concerns if she understands, good. If she doesn't, yk what to do.", "NTA\n\nMy brother, this is not you being overly jealous.\nThis is not you overreacting.\nThis is super sus, almost would go as far as to say I think you have found the \"friend you don't need to worry about\".\n\nAsk your gf how she would feel if you had a friend, who had tried to get into a relationship with you before, and at a pool party was acting the way her friend was, how would she react to that?\nHer response will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nI mean like, letter by letter spell it out to her, in my experience that's the best way to deal with these types of things because frankly you have to remind people of basic empathy.\n\nI'm also willing to bet that your current gf has a lot to do with the way you see yourself if she is going to play games like this.\n\nAlso, if the friends are hassling you, do the same thing to them, \"what advice would you give her if I was letting someone who is obviously interested in me touch me like that and then belittling all of her concerns and my mates were texting her calling her insecure?\"", "Them doing it (the grabbing) is semi-weird. Her telling you might be cause she is trying to feed into your insecurities to make sure u won't leave her (due to her insecurities). I tell my bf all the time when a guy hits on me, cause he should know (not that it happens that often) but I never tell him about my friends, cause we do the exact same things when he is there (like flirting) and it's always for fun.\n\nIf she is mentioning it she knows there are feelings involved and she is telling you on purpose.", "Maybe your girlfriend is trying to get you into a 3way", "NTA.\n\nIt would be less uncomfortable for you if your gf was straight, but since she is bisexual as you mentioned below (by the way you should edit the post to give that info) it's nothing different than a guy friend touching her ass.\n\nAlso why is she texting you that if she was going to just dismiss your reaction anyway?", "NTA. She playing games with your feelings and knows this", "Idk everyone seems like the ass here. Y\u2019all need to break up and do a little growing. It doesn\u2019t sound like either of you are ready for a serious relationship if that is what this is supposed to be. A lot of insecurities and lack of respect for boundaries. \n\nYour insecurities are going to continue to drive a wedge and her inability to respect your wishes and the boundaries of your relationship is not a good mix. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA \n\nJealousy isn't a reason for you to be considered an asshole, but I am the exact same way and would get jealous even if there was never any romantic interest involved before so I could be biased.", "NTA. This a reasonable boundary and your partner isn\u2019t respecting it.", "NTA. If she was simply texting you and saying not to feel insecure that's one thing, involving friends and letting them message you treating you that way over a private issue is not okay, that's toxic. Also if she feels the need to mention someone there is grabbing her butt, male or female, she knows it's abnormal already and not just 'friends', otherwise she wouldn't've mentioned it.", "NTA. You mentioned your gf is bisexual so you're well within your rights to tell her to stop. This is kind of a red flag tbh. And op you need to stop the negative self talk because at the end of the day people treat you the way you treat yourself. I'd say speak to her and set out your boundaries hard and if that doesn't work do what feels right. good luck!", "NTA. Also, maybe I\u2019m not a traditional girl friend, but I have never grabbed my friend\u2019s ass or had a friend grab my ass? That\u2019s just weird in my opinion.", "I feel as though perhaps your girlfriend is feeling uncomfortable, and she is contacting you for reassurance. \n\nIf her friends are brushing off her discomfort she might just want someone to let her know that if she is really uncomfortable it's okay for her to set a firmer boundary, and generally be supportive of her (or perhaps help her to get out of the situation). She might not be getting that support from the other friends if they are busy laughing it off.  NTA.", "When you grow up and become a man you\u2019ll lose your childish insecurity.", "NTA, your comparison is exactly right. Her \u201cjust a friend\u201d excuse doesn\u2019t work when the friend has actively tried to romance her in the past.\n\nIt\u2019s also quite homophobic as she doesn\u2019t see it as real. \u201cIt\u2019s just a girl and that\u2019s just what girls do\u201d If it were a guy friend grabbing her ass, she sounds like she would see it differently. But I guess she\u2019d be cool with your gay male friends grabbing your ass and touching you inappropriately.", "Just got out of a two year relationship because of her guy friends not respecting the relationship but \"they listen and give sound advice\" so it kinda had to end right then and there especially after I had to \"force\" her to drop the guy friends and then she was emotionally unavailable. Now she's suprised the guy friends don't wanna date her but they wanna love bomb and sext her so I meannnnnn I'm losing more hope day by day in the game of relationships lmao", "Yep girlfriend is a manipulative little sh*t.", "It IS an insecurity but it's a valid one to have. concern is insecurity. Why is everyone demonizing being insecure about things? lol", "NF - The Search 2:55  \n07", "Gf in this story is giving me the ick", "Took me a long time to realise I dated men who treated me the way my mom treats me. I don't have any advice but if it is a recurring thing, maybe it relates to an issue with a parent.", "ngl i think you\u2019re both kinda the AH here. she was definitely inconsiderate of your feelings and boundaries but instead of sincerely communicating after, you\u2019re ignoring and being intentionally distant and dry bc of your own insecurities by the sound of it. you both need to do better for each other or the relationship is gonna suffer/maybe end. have hard conversations when you need to, good luck", "Yes, you are talking about sexual assault!  That is a sexual assault.  It's a criminal act.", "I simply meant that you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not normal for ANY woman to touch each others butts or to be super feely. Obviously if it\u2019s not something that was discussed and okayed it\u2019s not okay! But I know quite a few women who are okay with slapping each others butts and they might kiss or whatever else. Again though, not even a high five is cool if the other person isn\u2019t okay with it", "No no! I meant that I know girls who are incredibly touchy feely and girls who don\u2019t like to be touched at all. My touchy feely girl friends are all 100% okay with the level of closeness between them, and they totally respect the fact that I would not like to be touched in any way, ever. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where I went wrong but my comments definitely was misunderstood! I was referring to consensual and close relationships with previously agreed upon boundaries. There\u2019s no amount of healthy touching if it isn\u2019t consensual!", "My friends and I routinely slap each others asses, and it\u2019s 100% consensual, which means it\u2019s not sexual assault. If it\u2019s an established thing in a friend group and no one is uncomfortable with it, then it\u2019s literally not sexual assault. I have friends who wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with it, so none of us do anything like that with them and everyone is happy. The gf is obviously fine with it, so she is not being assaulted, she\u2019s just being an ass to her boyfriend by crossing his boundaries and then rubbing it in his face.\n\nStop minimizing actual sexual assault to argue your point.", "Yes, I can say that sexual assault is not normal.  Just like any other sexual crime. Stop trying to defend it just because you know some pervs."]}
