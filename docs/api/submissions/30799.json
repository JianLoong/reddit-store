{"id": 30799, "submission_id": "17tair5", "title": "AITA for Refusing to Use My MIL's \"Dream Name\" for My Baby?", "selftext": "Hi everyone! This is mostly a throwaway post because I\u2019m mostly looking for peace of mind.I (26F) am pregnant with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s (27M) baby. We just found out we\u2019re having a girl, and the whole family is over the moon about it. This is the first girl that his family will have in 3 generations, so it\u2019s kind of a big deal.Anyway, since we told his family 2 weeks ago, his mother (64F) hasn\u2019t stopped bugging me about what we\u2019re going to name the baby. She gave a name, we\u2019ll call it \u201cG,\u201d that she says she\u2019s loved since she was a child. It\u2019s the name of her mother\u2019s sister who died before MIL was born, and she always thought it would be a kind gesture to honor the memory. Because she had 4 boys, she was never able to use the name\u2026 so she\u2019s asked us to use it.Here\u2019s the problem. \u201cG\u201d was the name of my middle and high school bully. I hate the name. Thinking about naming my child this name makes me feel physically ill. My fianc\u00e9 likes the name, but he says he understands how I feel. He tried to talk to his mother about it, but he must\u2019ve said that I had the problem with it, so now, she wants to talk to me about it.I tried to tell my fianc\u00e9 that this is none of her business, anyway, but like I said, this is her first grandchild AND the first girl that their family has had in, like, 80 years, so he thinks that we should at least hear her out. So, I agreed to meet with her earlier today.When we spoke about it this morning, MIL told me that it was always her \u201cdream\u201d to have a child named \u201cG\u201d and that if I refuse to name the baby that, she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll ever forgive me. When I tried explaining my point of view, even offering a compromise of making a slight variation of \u201cG\u201d her middle name, my MIL started crying and saying that I was being irrational. She said because the name means so much to her, I should be able to get over my own personal feelings about it from \u201ca girl who was mean to \\[me\\] 15 years ago.\u201dHere\u2019s where I might be the AH. I told my MIL that this baby is mine and my husband\u2019s to name and she doesn\u2019t really get a say. She screamed at me about how I\u2019m trying to undermine her and I basically told her that if she was going to throw a tantrum, we couldn\u2019t have a conversation about this.Now, my fianc\u00e9 is upset. He thinks we should just give the baby 2 middle names or just make the middle name \u201cG\u201d to appease his mother, but I can\u2019t do it.\n\nThe main problem is that I haven\u2019t told him the extent of the bullying I endured. I don't like to discuss it, but \u201cG\u201d was essentially the reason that I ended up in a psych ward in the 8th grade, and to be reminded of someone so horrible when I look at my baby would be way too difficult for me to ever move past. I'm scared to tell him how bad it got because I don't want him to look at me differently. I know how it sounds, but I'm afraid.So AITA? Did I go too far with MIL? Should I just tell my fianc\u00e9 why I can't use the name?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nWow, thank you so much everyone for the responses! I really appreciate all the advice you're giving me, especially those who reached out with resources to help deal with situations like this. I didn't expect this outpour of support, and I really do appreciate it so much. \n\nI want to clear some things up quickly while I can, since my original post wasn't giving as much detail as I hoped!\n\n1. My partner didn't pressure me to talk to his mother after she was adamant about the name. I was stupid and I wanted to hopefully keep the peace if possible, so I suggested it. I was dumb enough to think she would have a rational conversation about it and I asked her to brunch and she was just... very crazy. I don't tend to have big emotional reactions and, because of other stuff in my past, when people react the way she did, I tend to shut down! So, I barely reacted and went into (former) nanny mode and scolded her a bit, which was why I was so conflicted about my response. I was worried I was being condescending or unkind, so I appreciate all of your responses telling me otherwise!\n2. Before I wrote this post, my partner and I hadn't talked about anything. His mom got to him before I did today, since I didn't want to bother him while he was coaching my nephew's soccer game. That was mistake number 2; I should've called him right away. \n3. When MIL brought up the name initially, I told my fianc\u00e9 that I didn't like it because of a kid that was mean to me in middle school and HS. So I think I didn't get the point across that this girl literally tried to ruin my life for YEARS. I didn't feel like it was necessary, since I said I hated the name and didn't want it attached. \n4. ALSO! Both me and my partner go to therapy individually. I really liked the suggestions that we should go together, and I think that might help a lot with sorting this out. \n\nOkay, that being said, after reading some of your posts, I talked to my partner. Taking some of your advice, my sister came over for dinner, and I sat us all down at the table to explain the situation. I told my sister the name that MIL wanted and she immediately looked HORRIFIED. She immediately started talking about all the awful things that \"G\" had done to me, thankfully stopping before anything got too deep, but my partner looked really confused. \n\nHe said he didn't know that I experienced stuff like that and that, because I didn't clarify how bad it was, his mom told him that it was just some girl that I didn't like in middle school. A lot of you called that, so good job lol\n\n I said the thing about how I was mad that he didn't automatically take my side. He basically said that his mom had been up his ass about it and he only went along with it because she seemed VERY passionate about it, while I seemed to care significantly less. \n\nI had to explain to him that just because I'm not having a breakdown actively in front of him doesn't mean I don't care about something. We talked about how his mom being so crazy about things and overreacting was his indicator that he had to fix stuff growing up, so he kind of slips back into it now. I told him that wouldn't work with stuff with the baby. He says he agrees. We're going to talk to MIL tomorrow together. I'll update if she does more crazy shit which, as many of you have said, she probably will.

And frankly if he sees you differently for it and/or still sides with your MIL ? I think it'll help you dodge a bullet.

It makes no sense. \n\nSecond, I wouldn\u2019t tell your fianc\u00e9 the full extent only because he will def pass that info on to his mother, and she will use that to hurt you when you do not name your baby what she wants.

You need to make sure he understands that he is not to repeat what you tell him. He can say that you were bullied traumatically by the bully, but he cannot give details. I'm being very specific on this because I have read over and over and over again how a wife tells her husband something and he's a mama's boy, and he promised not to say anything and the mother-in-law always finds out. Guess who told her? The husband aka Mama's boy.", "Only a narcissist would think they have the right to name another person's child and that dismissing the parent's trauma was justified. You say your husband is used to appeasing his mother's dramatic behavior, which means he has been trained by a narcissist to keep the peace. He can't see this for what it really is because he, too, has suffered trauma from the bullying of a narcissistic parent. \nBe honest with him about your childhood and trauma. At that age, bullying is so encompassing that we can't process it like a rational adult. That's impossible to ask of a child. But be prepared that he may not fully understand because he has been trained to 'get over himself' his whole life. This is why he thinks just giving your daughter that middle name is the right thing. Even knowing your trauma, because does not recognize his own, it will be hard for him to stand up for himself,  you, and your daughter. You will need to be patient and communicate your boundaries and needs regularly. \nHonestly,  counseling would be helpful for him but also for you. This will not be the last narcissistic attack your MIL throws at you, even if it's the first. Knowing that you're not misunderstanding her and you're not crazy will make it easier for you. \nCongratulations!

That she has to come help and that being the time that we should be bonding with baby will be her holding the baby and me catering to her. That she has to have so many visits a week.

This is mostly a throwaway post because I\u2019m mostly looking for peace of mind.   \nI (26F) am pregnant with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s (27M) baby. We just found out we\u2019re having a girl, and the whole family is over the moon about it. This is the first girl that his family will have in 3 generations, so it\u2019s kind of a big deal.   \nAnyway, since we told his family 2 weeks ago, his mother (64F) hasn\u2019t stopped bugging me about what we\u2019re going to name the baby. She gave a name, we\u2019ll call it \u201cG,\u201d that she says she\u2019s loved since she was a child. It\u2019s the name of her mother\u2019s sister who died before MIL was born, and she always thought it would be a kind gesture to honor the memory. Because she had 4 boys, she was never able to use the name\u2026 so she\u2019s asked us to use it.   \nHere\u2019s the problem. \u201cG\u201d was the name of my middle and high school bully. I hate the name. Thinking about naming my child this name makes me feel physically ill.   \nMy fianc\u00e9 likes the name, but he says he understands how I feel. He tried to talk to his mother about it, but he must\u2019ve said that I had the problem with it, so now, she wants to talk to me about it.   \nI tried to tell my fianc\u00e9 that this is none of her business, anyway, but like I said, this is her first grandchild AND the first girl that their family has had in, like, 80 years, so he thinks that we should at least hear her out. So, I agreed to meet with her earlier today.  \nWhen we spoke about it this morning, MIL told me that it was always her \u201cdream\u201d to have a child named \u201cG\u201d and that if I refuse to name the baby that, she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll ever forgive me. When I tried explaining my point of view, even offering a compromise of making a slight variation of \u201cG\u201d her middle name, my MIL started crying and saying that I was being irrational. She said because the name means so much to her, I should be able to get over my own personal feelings about it from \u201ca girl who was mean to \\[me\\] 15 years ago.\u201d   \nHere\u2019s where I might be the AH. I told my MIL that this baby is mine and my husband\u2019s to name and she doesn\u2019t really get a say. She screamed at me about how I\u2019m trying to undermine her and I basically told her that if she was going to throw a tantrum, we couldn\u2019t have a conversation about this.   \nNow, my fianc\u00e9 is upset. He thinks we should just give the baby 2 middle names or just make the middle name \u201cG\u201d to appease his mother, but I can\u2019t do it. \n\nThe main problem is that I haven\u2019t told him the extent of the bullying I endured. I don't like to discuss it, but \u201cG\u201d was essentially the reason that I ended up in a psych ward in the 8th grade, and to be reminded of someone so horrible when I look at my baby would be way too difficult for me to ever move past. I'm scared to tell him how bad it got because I don't want him to look at me differently. I know how it sounds, but I'm afraid.  \nSo AITA? Did I go too far with MIL? Should I just tell my fianc\u00e9 why I can't use the name?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Whether it be friends, family, or loved ones, I feel like in order for them to trust me, I have to trust them. And I don't know how else that can happen without being open about my own experiences.

Your baby. Your decisions.", "Thing is, can OP TRUST him not to tell Mommy, if she confides it all to him.\n\nAnd don't you just see how Mommy would use this against her.  I actually think your suggestion is brilliant.  \n\nIt is the truth, but it doesn't give him details that he will likely slip to Mommy(Based on him telling Mommy it was OP who objected to name--he's not willing private details to himself).", "Underrated comment. I quite like this advice. OP, as Live-Eye said, just disclose that \"G\" put you in the hospital because of the bullying and that you won't go in to more details because you don't want to relive the past/trauma. His reaction to this will either make you feel safe and consider disclosing more details, or make you rethink your and your fianc\u00e9's relationship a bit. 'No' is a complete sentence, and you deserve to be with someone who respects your boundaries and will put you first.", "This relationship is destined to end with divorce if OP is pressured into naming the little girl \u201cG\u201d.

Her having being bullied is so not the issue here. OP said no. Her baby daddy thinks his Mummy dearest saying \u201cyes, that name, it has to be that name\u201d somehow trumps OP saying no. The context is literally not important here. People need to stop getting bogged down on the bullying and start focussing in the fact that MIL doesn\u2019t get to name the child.", "But he doesnt NEED to know details to back up her No. She said No. She shouldn't need anything more than that to have him back her up. If she has to justify her No...thats so many levels of not okay.", "THIS. 100%. (Edit: Im actually concerned that grandma will take it upon herself to \"nickname\" the baby \"G\". Out of earshot of the parents, of course.)", "Exactly, so now you know what she is, no more need to worry or feel guilty about anything to do with her. You will never be good in her eyes.

I told my mom and she loved it, too. she was offended on my behalf for the sly comment and lack of support from my husband. probably felt offended herself as it was her father\u2019s middle name that was an issue. MIL had said the middle name should change. She had her chance to name 5 boys and a girl and made them ALL have B names so I ultimately took her opinion with a grain of salt but the comments and drama never stopped. it has only stopped now because she has set her sights on my brother in law\u2019s long term girlfriend. poor girl is having issues with my BIL not even believing the things MIL has said to/about her.", "I fear that this MIL might be as malicious as one of the ones on JNMIL, and actively start referring to the daughter as G whenever she's alone with her, to effectively gaslight the child into thinking that it's what their name should be.", "I wish I could do more than just upvote this.

Whoever puts in the work, gets to name the baby!", "Like I get why you'd say this, but being so vulgar about it is short-sighted and self-defeating. OP's partner should absolutely stand up for her, but it's complicated because he loves his mother, and being crass like this is an ineffective rhetorical strategy.", "I did this to my FFil. No more baby talk. Yay!", "It might feel good to say something like this (if you enjoy being vulgar and mean), but it\u2018s absolutely not helpful, neither in the short nor long run.", "Fair point, if OP can\u2019t be sure the partner wouldn\u2019t spill those details then that\u2019s a whole other problem, but yes she could also just tell him she ended up in the hospital and leave it at that.", "Yeah that's a good point there \ud83e\udd14 \n\nThanks, nicely explained, much better than those other commenters lol", "He doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s true.
