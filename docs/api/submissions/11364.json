It\u2019s just so incredibly shitty to use someone as a beard and while it is maybe understandable and forgivable as a teen when you are coming to terms with yourself and you risk being kicked out of your house by your parents, to do this serially and long into adulthood is beyond the pale. He\u2019s treating these women like they aren\u2019t real people. \n\nAnd it\u2019s shitty of the woman to out him when she said she wouldn\u2019t.

That\u2019s probably where you fucked up if you didn\u2019t realise she clearly was going to tell people. However, you are no longer friends with this person, you disapprove of his behaviour so much you haven\u2019t been in the friend group for years and as they have dated recently it shows he has NOT changed.

She goes to church. She isn't going to enjoy the loveless life until she's forty when he divorces her to marry the love of his life. That's what he is trapping her into. He wants to basically still her years of beauty and youth and fertility from her to make a broken home, where she's devoid of romantic life and has no idea. He is basically going to suck the life out of her.\n\nEvery one here telling you Y T A are dead wrong. It's the same as telling someone their spouse is cheating. If you don't believe me read stories of women who went through that. You my friend are a hero, but one that isn't recognized by society yet, because those women stories aren't widely known yet. I am friend in a religious feminist  groups and I read those stories every once in a while, and it's horrible what those women went through and are going through still. They find themselves religious single mother poor divorcee with a gay ex husband, no one wants to consort with them, with no emotional or community resources to deal with it, while their husbands are rocking it with their new husbands', and their entire memories from decades of marriage is them trying to suck out some love and physical attentions from their husbands to no veil, with out any idea what they are doing wrong or how it's supposed to be, being religious. So they actually never experienced romantic love after all their struggles and sacrifices, and after basically loosing everything.\n\nAnd the best part they usually discover that the religious leaders of the community they followed and believed, were actually *in on that.* They're complete methodical ruin of their life was actually done by those they trusted the most - their husbands and their leaders. And no one said pip, for decades.\n\nIt's one of the most horrible experiences, and it goes on forever, because there aren't enough people like you around.

The risks of coming out vary a lot depending on the area you're living in (in my area it's a lot more progressive for instance, and that wouldn't be a realistic concern).

Sometimes a straight person realizes they\u2019re not only attracted to the opposite gender. Sometimes someone who thought they were lesbian realizes they\u2019re bi. Sexualities are labels that only the people that owns them can dictate what they are and unless your friend actually did something objectively shitty, you are an absolute asshole for spreading personal information about someone you\u2019ve never met in and haven\u2019t talked to in 10+ years. \n\nHe might\u2019ve realized he was bi or pan. Maybe he hasn\u2019t. But you don\u2019t know whether he did or not now do you?

OP is assuming ill intent on his ex friend for what went on in their relationship with the woman OP went on a date with when OP hasn't known the person since high school.

I am a completely different person now than I was in my teens because I have more knowledge, experience, and introspection than I did at that time.
