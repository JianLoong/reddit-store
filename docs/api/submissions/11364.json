It\u2019s just so incredibly shitty to use someone as a beard and while it is maybe understandable and forgivable as a teen when you are coming to terms with yourself and you risk being kicked out of your house by your parents, to do this serially and long into adulthood is beyond the pale.

I am friend in a religious feminist  groups and I read those stories every once in a while, and it's horrible what those women went through and are going through still. They find themselves religious single mother poor divorcee with a gay ex husband, no one wants to consort with them, with no emotional or community resources to deal with it, while their husbands are rocking it with their new husbands', and their entire memories from decades of marriage is them trying to suck out some love and physical attentions from their husbands to no veil, with out any idea what they are doing wrong or how it's supposed to be, being religious. So they actually never experienced romantic love after all their struggles and sacrifices, and after basically loosing everything.\n\nAnd the best part they usually discover that the religious leaders of the community they followed and believed, were actually *in on that.* They're complete methodical ruin of their life was actually done by those they trusted the most - their husbands and their leaders.

Op should have spoke to the guy first to give him a chance to stop using women.", "Was specifically responding to \u201couting someone in any capacity is never okay.\u201d Not much to be misunderstood there, I just fundamentally disagree with you in the scenarios I listed.", "If someone was systematically lying to you about something big, and had been doing so for years, would you want to know?", "I would also add that maybe the gay friend now finds his sexuality more fluid than in his youth. Op is running on old information from a person he isn't in contact with, he doesn't know that she was just a beard.", "Maybe the friend isn't a good person. Other possibility is his friend was trying to be straight (or is more fluid). Prior to my own coming out process I dated the opposite sex when i was younger because I so wanted to believe (also religious background) that if I just met \"the one\" everything would be fine. It wasn't to have a beard. It was really trying. OP overlooks the struggle his friend may have been going through at the time, not using the woman at all but hoping he could fall for her (especially if they were compatible on other levels). Odd he immediately ascribes malicious intent to his good friend. OP is definitely TA in any case.", "Like you\u2019re right I\u2019m just responding to the idea that it was okay for this guy to use women like that (with perhaps no intention of stopping) and OP needs to just stay out of it. If it was one woman that\u2019s a pretty different scenario to if it\u2019s some guy like who continues to do this to other women because he can\u2019t sort his own life out. I think that is not okay but I think OP could have handled it much differently I agree. I think it would have been best to reach out to the friend and let them know that this isn\u2019t okay and that you\u2019re not going to continue to cover for them forever if you keep running into people that are being harmed by the lie.", "Yikes, that little rant reminded me of when I talk to TERFS.\nDid you really just call being gay a \u201csexual preference\u201d?\n\nIt is very clear that the gay person is in a terribly unsupportive situation, and you can get a very good perspective on this if you read the comment by ark3030 in the thread by kittieslove1.", "How about we consider what the post from OP is and only contemplate whether it was an AH vote or NAH vote as to what their actions were irrespective of their friend did or didn\u2019t do as the post is only about their own actions not the actions of the friend. The reason people aren\u2019t talking about your point is because it is irrelevant to the post itself. I think out of the comments the vast majority do agree with your point but because it doesn\u2019t have relevancy into the situation of OP and their action, they aren\u2019t commenting on it.", "You are clearly super, super damaged. I hope you heal from whatever made you this awful.", ">ur defending the guy.\n\nThis is the crap I'm talking about, I haven't even posted any other comment in this post.\n\nYou are just desperate for replies and attention, the least you could do is not make it so obvious lmfao.", "You literally said Nta. And OP did spread the info. It was not OPs place to say anything.", "Please don't try to defend homophobic language. Saying \"normal\" when you mean \"straight\" is plain old homophobia, regardless of the context.", "If the comments are to be believed you are right, but I am skeptical. \n\nWhy wouldn't OP have included information like \"my ex friend is a misogynistic asshole who defends rapists and believes women shouldn't be allowed in movies\" in his original post? \n\nWhenever the comments are so wild, I suspect the OP is either making up info after the comments turned against them, or exercising their creative writing chops.", "Were not defending the friend, is he a total ah? Yes. We have no idea how he's changed in the time since OP has known him, and OP is a biased narrator. So while we can dislike the friend based on what we hear this post isn't about him. \n\n\n\n\nBarring warning a woman who's about to get married that their partner is gay there is NO REASON to out someone. This relationship with this woman was over. There was no reason to tell her this secret. His friends sexuality was NOT impacting her life anymore. She would have chocked it up to just a short bad relationship with an AH and moved on. Yes, the friend is playing with women's emotions. Op RUINED A MANS LIFE and potentially put him in danger depending on the area. Both are AHs but were only here to judge OP today. We will have to wait for the friends post to judge him.", "Where did I say I was defending anyone? \n\nEdit, really downvoted for this? When I literally didn't defend anyone. People are weird on reddit sometimes. Lol", "Please edit the original post with this additional info. \n\nAs it currently stands every new commenter is starting new arguments with people who have read your replies offering more info. \n\nThis post will get deleted before long based on many of these comments going too far, better to include info now.", "Even with those details, YTA. This guy sucks, sure, but that doesn't give you a pass on outing him.", "I won\u2019t call you an asshole, but you made a mistake. You could have just told the girl that ex-friend is not a nice person. That\u2019s why you are ex-friends. You don\u2019t need to give details that cannot be corroborated (misogynistic comments, sexuality, etc.) You literally could have just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry he hurt you. I knew him. He was not a good person.\u201d \n\nYou were wrong to provide personal information.", "what do you mean \"identifies\" as gay? A person is either gay or not, you dont get to choose to change it. fucking delusional losers in this subreddit lmao", "Okay. So you\u2019re agreeing that OP is the asshole in this specific scenario?", "OP said in his comments, EX friend is a repeat offender, is extremely sexist and puts down women. He also defended a friend who attempted to rape.", "Absolutely and this is something I hadn\u2019t originally put thought to and could be a possibility. The justification in this area can be muddy in the best of circumstances but we can\u2019t discount that they may well be using women as a shield for their sexuality. My entire point would still be that OP doesn\u2019t get to out anyone for any reason other than a direct \u2018can you tell these people for me\u2019 from the person in question as that should be the only thing we\u2019re judging on the post itself.", "Sorry mate. I shouldn't have written that like I was attacking you. You make good points!", "I'm not defending anything. Your comments achieve nothing more than just patting yourself on the back. That's clearly the thought process of everybody involved in the original posy. It doesn't denote how people think. But if you want to keep it up go ahead. I couldn't care less.", "i agree, that is definitely important enough information that would be worthy of the main post. I too am always skeptical.", "Not telling the truth is lying.  Sorry but that's just how words work.  Being closeted is one thing, using and emotionally abusing others to serve your own interests is another.\n\nAt best your argument supports the possibility that he was also lying to himself. That is the kindest interpretation.\n\nHarm was done by OP and by the friend.", "Nah. There is a history of choosing to be celibate in Christianity. Dude could just say he\u2019s following the advice of Paul and avoiding marriage altogether. There\u2019s absolutely no need for him to be using these women.", "He never talked to this \u201cfriend\u201d. At least, not for 10 YEARS. Idk what OP was hoping to accomplish here cause it just seems to me like there\u2019s a personal vendetta here that they\u2019re not mentioning. Cut him out of OPs life cause of the stupid ass things said from over a decade ago? Sure go ahead. But there\u2019s gotta be more to it.", "Don't do it Op, let the chaos reign!", "I think it\u2019s hilarious you\u2019ve had this account for 2 years and yet it was the concept of people exploring their sexuality that finally got you to comment lmao", "He may have thought he identified as gay at the beginning, but found out later that he might be bi, but has a stronger preference for men", "I think it\u2019s an ESH. OP should\u2019ve given his former friend the chance to come clean/ change the behavior talked about in the comments.\n\nI don\u2019t blame the ex gf for telling her friends. That\u2019s a pretty natural reaction to finding out you were bearded by an apparent chauvinist.", "That's a lot of missing context from the original post.", "He can rot in hell, then. Being gay is probably his best characteristic.", "Totally agree. From the post, all u can say is OP is TA. If the friend is just using women to hide the he would also be TA. I just can't tell that from whats shared. Using people as a shield would be wrong. .", "Uh, no. They're completely right, it's homophobic language and there's no excuse for it. Straight is not normal, it's average. \n\n\"Normal\" in air quotes would have been acceptable.\n\nBut I'm glad the presumably straight person is here to correct queer people on what is and isn't appropriate language when discussing queer people. You know, not like our lived experiences mean anything.", "Actually, it's not 'patting myself on the back' it's standing up for myself to not be seen as something less than normal. But you keep being homophobic and perpetuating the use of homophobic language, good job.", "i love how you had to go through my profile to try and find some ammunition to respond rather then respond to the content of what i said...and you still didnt find anything, lmao", "This is indeed possible, but you see how this is literally just pure speculation? not conducive to the discussion to make wild assumptions like this", "It was literally six months and the relationship didn\u2019t work out. It happens. That\u2019s between his friend and the woman.", "You\u2019ve really never encountered people who explore their sexuality?

An assumption, yes. But it all comes down to OP not talking to this guy and getting all facts for himself. He too is also assuming", "I don\u2019t have to say anything about his intentions. I know for a fact that he dated a woman under false pretenses. When you deceive someone and play with emotions, you deserve whatever happens. The woman had a right to know that she was dating a man who is not attracted to women.", "There are probably lots of gay people who wouldn\u2019t mind dating a closeted gay person.", "Abuse is so much more variable than you are portraying.\n\n  Things don't need to be compared to being considered abuse, and your preference for one form of abuse over another doesn't mean your asinine comparison between what's a worse form of abuse matters.\n\nPurposefully misleading somebody and being sexually and emotionally absent because of that lie is emotional abuse.  It's contextual. Somebody who is not emotionally or sexually available due to prior abuse, mistreatment, etc is not being abusive in return.  Nothing is black and white.", "*6 months*\n\nThat\u2019s nothing! Do you expect to spend the rest of your life with every person you date?

But if all that happened is they dated for only 6 months and then broke up, I don\u2019t see what the problem is. \n\nObviously it\u2019s not great to knowingly string someone along for months, but anyone can do that, gay or straight. I know plenty of people who dated emotionally unavailable or immature or selfish people. Their lives continued.", "Oh my GOD it was only six months???", "You would've wanted to know that a woman you dated was lesbian more then you would've wanted to know she defended rapists?", "Maybe I'm understanding the word wrong, I'm not a native speaker. To my understanding, abuse is actually a crime. I do not think that it should be turned around to mean \"my partner is not doing enough for me\". There was a time not too long ago where married people could actually sue each other for not doing their \"marital duties\", including sex. Hopefully you'll agree that's not a good thing. If there is no active harm done, just a lack of interest, I will never consider that to be abuse (unless it's with regard to children or other dependants)."]}
