There was a kid in my class who I'll call Sean. Sean was the \"class clown\" type, always cracking jokes, but often at the expense of others. We were not friends and my friend group was one of his more common targets. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was a bully, but he was not a nice person.\n\n  \n\n\nIn class one day, he was feeling particularly jokey and the teacher had to keep correcting his attempts at \"contributing\" to the discussion. After a few corrections of some very stupid comments that were doing nothing but derail the class, Sean finally says \"Oh, come on Mr. C, you're making a fool of me.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI then said under my breath \"Well that's not hard to do.\" However I apparently said that louder than I intended and at a moment where the rest of the class was completely silent, so everyone heard. It resulted in half the class doing the typical high school teenager reaction of yelling \"Ohhhhhhhh\". The teacher did a good job of getting everyone back on track and it was never really brought up again. He never approached me later, nor did I approach him.\n\n  \n\n\nThat teacher has since passed away, which led to us reminiscing about their class during the reunion, and someone brought up what happened that day. Sean wasn't in the particular circle that was having this conversation, but he was close by and must have overheard, as I saw him dismiss himself to the restroom right after that story was brought up.\n\n  \n\n\nHe approached me later and demanded that I apologize to him for that comment 10 years ago. I told him \"Sure, but you need to apologize to everyone you made fun of first.\" He didn't appreciate that response and he walked away. He seemed to be in a sour mood whenever I saw him the rest of the reunion. I still don't know what prompted him to demand an apology after all this time.\n\n  \n\n\nI told my friend group about the interaction and they're pretty split about whether I should have just apologized or not, since it was something that happened 10 years ago. The thing is, if he had approached me nicely and simply asked, I probably would have apologized. Instead, he came up to me and just went right into saying that I \"needed\" to apologize to him. In my mind, I don't need to apologize for a single comment I made if he can't apologize for the 4 years of comments he made.\n\n  \n\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for not apologizing?", "created_utc": 1685794123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zaw21/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_something_i_said_10/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
