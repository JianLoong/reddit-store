There was a kid in my class who I'll call Sean. Sean was the \"class clown\" type, always cracking jokes, but often at the expense of others. We were not friends and my friend group was one of his more common targets. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was a bully, but he was not a nice person.\n\n  \n\n\nIn class one day, he was feeling particularly jokey and the teacher had to keep correcting his attempts at \"contributing\" to the discussion. After a few corrections of some very stupid comments that were doing nothing but derail the class, Sean finally says \"Oh, come on Mr. C, you're making a fool of me.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI then said under my breath \"Well that's not hard to do.\" However I apparently said that louder than I intended and at a moment where the rest of the class was completely silent, so everyone heard. It resulted in half the class doing the typical high school teenager reaction of yelling \"Ohhhhhhhh\". The teacher did a good job of getting everyone back on track and it was never really brought up again. He never approached me later, nor did I approach him.\n\n  \n\n\nThat teacher has since passed away, which led to us reminiscing about their class during the reunion, and someone brought up what happened that day. Sean wasn't in the particular circle that was having this conversation, but he was close by and must have overheard, as I saw him dismiss himself to the restroom right after that story was brought up.\n\n  \n\n\nHe approached me later and demanded that I apologize to him for that comment 10 years ago. I told him \"Sure, but you need to apologize to everyone you made fun of first.\" He didn't appreciate that response and he walked away. He seemed to be in a sour mood whenever I saw him the rest of the reunion. I still don't know what prompted him to demand an apology after all this time.\n\n  \n\n\nI told my friend group about the interaction and they're pretty split about whether I should have just apologized or not, since it was something that happened 10 years ago. The thing is, if he had approached me nicely and simply asked, I probably would have apologized. Instead, he came up to me and just went right into saying that I \"needed\" to apologize to him.

It\u2019s always nice when the other students realize this and help you out with the would-be clown.", "You said exactly the right thing. He is not better than the people he made fun of. \n\nBecause one person pointed out his crappy behavior, doesn't mean he is owed for it. People should have been pointing out his crappy behavior long before you did.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Sean hasn't changed. He doesn't see the harm he's done, but he can clearly see how he's been \"hurt\" and has the balls to demand an apology. He can pound sand. Poor baby Sean.", "NTA but only because sounds like the lamest game of tit for tat possible. He rolled up on you strong and wrong and there\u2019s a way to go about trying to get what you want that results in you getting what you want or ways to go about it that make you feel better in the moment. Didn\u2019t ANYONE ELSE GET RAISED BY JOHN WAYNE MOVIES? Stand for something or stand for nothing and yeah you are right to expect to be treated with decency, looks like it still isn\u2019t hard to make him look like a fool.", "Dude held on to THAT for 10 years? lmao fragile", "NTA- That wasn't even that mean what you said lmao.", "I would say you both wrong. Why are you still living in the past?. Move on!!!! Get rid of unnecessary weight.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA", "This\n\nNTA\n\nThose Jokesters tend to keep doing that into adulthood and never learn that what they do still bothers people. I'm 50. Same people, same jokes at 30 year reunion.  It is old.", "He **defo** can't take it, the little snowflakey class clown!\n\nDemanding an apology for something that was said 10 years ago, brought on by himself?! And it was quite a small thing! I was expecting some demanding an apology for years of bullying or something!\n\nNah, this poor boy had his wittle ego hurt and has been in his hurt feelings for over a decade?!?!!!! \n\nWild!", "Yes, perfectly put! He was very high handed demanding an apology after his behaviour to others.\n\nOP your response was golden about how you would apologise but only after he does to everyone he gave his smart remarks to. \n\nOP you burned him a second time - but with an even better retort.\n\nDude came to a battle of wits unarmed.", "I mean, that depends on what happened but in this case I agree.", "I'm not living in the past and I'm not carrying any weight? I hadn't thought about that moment or Sean in years. I just thought it was rude for his first words to me in 10 years was to demand an apology from me when he hasn't apologized for anything he's done/said. Like I said, I probably would have apologized if he had been nice, but his approach clearly showed he hasn't changed a bit.", "I feel like your comment was enough that it made the rounds in school, enough that it is being discussed a decade later.", "[deleted]", "That being said, if he didn't change his ways some, you are off the hook for an apology.", "You said exactly the right thing. He is not better than the people he made fun of.", "NTA", "huh? i\u2019m not related to this story at all.", "That's a Spam Harmful Bot.  It just copies and pastes others comments.", "ugh, of course \ud83d\ude44. thanks for letting me know", "NTA\n\nHe's not a clown. He's the entire circus.\n\n> \"Sure, but you need to apologize to everyone you made fun of first.\" \n\nHah! Consequences!\n\nI award thee with the title Karma, Beholder of Retribution", "Lol NTA. The fact that he even still cares screams \u201cI peaked in high school.\u201d", "The typical large and in unison group reaction of extremely loud and audible \"Ohhhhhhhhh\" \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32 when something interesting/crazy happens will never cease to amuse TF outta me. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nOP you are NTA. You didn't disrespect them and only spoke facts and they were only offended because they realized just how right YOU actually were when you said it. You didn't bully or humiliate them, just made an in general audible statement that everyone happened to hear. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Class clowns are something society told us was ok and we shouldn't complain because if they said something about us they \"were probably right\" or \"at least people know you exist\" or \"it's just a joke\" and all those thing we were told (I'm around the same age as OP) was normalised bullying. No-one should have to endure this. I remember one of the class clowns (F) kept trying to be funny in kit and the teacher kept on ignoring her. The play we were reading was hilarious if you understood the sarcasm. At one point I start laughing and even crying so everyone wondered what waddling me laugh so hard and CC said: don't bother people, it's \"smart humour\" to which the professor (who was sick and tired of CC\"s jokes) responded: and that's why you don't get them. Best teacher ever.", "NTA. On behalf of all who had to listen to losers like this disrupting discussions and, worse, keeping everyone longer after class had officially ended, thank you.", "NTA.  A bully doesn't deserve a damn thing.", "ESH everyone just needs to get over it already. Imagine being in your late 20\u2019s still thinking about a comment you made/was made about you 10 years ago.", "Are you sorry? If not, then NTA. He dished it out, he can take it.", "Is this an ad for the new season of The Afterparty?! Jkjk", " NTA.. he obviously can only dish it out", "NTA.", "I teach middle school and literally every school I've ever taught at has one in every classroom. School districts aren't gonna buy electric pencil sharpeners for teachers when they can just put one of these in and call it a day", "All the NTAs here (with which I agree) are very reassuring to me, because I had a very similar experience at my 50th high school class reunion. This guy who was a complete asshole to me all through junior high and high school came up to me at the reunion and demanded an apology for, as he put it, getting him into trouble after I reported him for destroying my property. I pretended I had no memory of that incident and laid some pretty sarcastic remarks on him. He threw up his hands in disgust and walked away. Still a dick, fifty years later.", "Some fools just never learn. NTA", "um i farted and no u r not ta", "Don\u2019t throw stones if ya can\u2019t catch \u2018em.", "I literally hadn't thought about that moment in at least 5 years. I wasn't even the one to bring it up at the reunion.", "ASCII ART LIVES!!!", "My dad had a similar sentiment when I was growing up: you have to be able to laugh at yourself before you try and take a run at anyone else.", "It might, but on my phone, this is just a misshapen mangled mass, gasping for breath. It's just a bunch of punctuation with no discernable shape. \ud83e\udd37", "NTA lmao, like you said if he couldn\u2019t apologize for everything he had said back then, you don\u2019t need to apologize for what you said.", "NTA, I thought what you did was gonna be WAY more serious than that. Was it embarrassing for him? Sure, but a normal person would have learned their lesson from that.", "Went to my 30th class reunion   First and last I ever attended \u2026this female classmate stated that I picked on her from first grade till graduation \u2026 so I asked her who she was\u2026 I had no idea! She left in a huff\u2026", "Solid, OP\nNTA", "NTA.  Sean created this situation and doesn't like being on the receiving end of the comments/jokes.", "Nta", "Great response", "Ass hats, some of us actually wanted to learn what was being taught. Maybe not eloquently but I\u2019ve called them out too. Nice to hear my teacher may have been okay with me piping up", "NTA. 10 years and that is all he had on his mind to clear up from high school?", "NTA", "Bully wanted to bully you into apologizing to him? Aww, hell no. Nta", "Oooh sick burn. You really hurt his feelings there, agreeing with his statement that he was being made a fool of. Definitely something worth holding on to for a decade. \n\nDemanding an apology, for a singular comment, made in high school, is weird, at best. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t laugh at him - I absolutely would have assumed he was joking. \n\nYou don\u2019t *need* to do anything. If he can\u2019t take it, he shouldn\u2019t have dished it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s a lot different kinds of bullies but the common feature is that they are cowards who dish it out but can\u2019t take any negativity back. You don\u2019t owe him anything", "He can serve but not eat the dish", "NTA, he was making jokes at the expense of other people, there is nothing to apologize for here. He was being an a**, and you just put him in his place.", "NTA", "NTA - the fact he remembers this from 10 years ago means it was right on point and true.", "NTA. He was acting like an ass and got called out. 10 years later, he is still acting like an ass. No apology is deserved."]}
