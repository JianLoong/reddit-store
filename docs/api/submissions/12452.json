I pulled her aside to see what was up. She expressed that she felt my gifts to the kids were sexist. She claimed that the gifts I got for my nephew promoted exploration and that they were more educational/interactive and cool. She said the gifts I got my niece \"reeked of gender stereotypes\" of women doing the cleaning, cooking, and caretaking.\n\nI was honestly in shock. I felt like I picked out good gifts for my niece and nephew, and I even made sure to include an ocean themed gift for each of them. I spent a similar amount on each of them and didn't really think there was an issue with any of the things I got.\n\nI told my sister that she should be grateful that I got them both lots of gifts. She called me an asshole and stormed off, didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.

You gave the girl toys that are about being a servant, doing chores for other people and looking pretty, and you gave the boy science toys and dinosaurs. Why didn't you get the boy cooking sets, vacuums, and dolls? Yeah, we know why.\n\nWorse, you refuse to even consider your sister's point of view. In response to her claim of sexism, you say \"I got an ocean themed gift for each of them\" and \"I spent a similar amount on each of them\". But neither is responsive to your sister's concern - you don't show any willingness to acknowledge the issue, which is stubborn and rude.\n\nYour sister is absolutely right to reject these unkind, stereotypical gifts. It sets a poor example for both children, especially the girl. It shows your mindset is very antiquated, and I would be frankly embarrassed if I were you.\n\nReconsider how you relate to children and their gender before engaging with your nieces and nephews, I'm sure being exposed to your stereotypes would negatively impact their development.\n\nEasy YTA\n\nEdit: OP, when asked why he didn't get the boy any cooking items, responds \"I know he wouldn\u2019t want to play with those things\" and when asked how he knows, responds: \"I assumed, because those were the types of toys in the girl\u2019s toy section.\" which I will take as a straightforward admission of sexist stereotyping.", "YTA\n\nYou bought them gendered gifts.

Yes, you threw some ocean themed gifts for your niece in there but the rest were really not it. Gender stereotyping at work! Let me tell you a story. When my little daughter stopped using diapers we told her she could pick any gift as a celebration. She chose a vacuum cleaner. I\u2019m a woman and the working parent. My husband is the stay at home. Imagine my shock to have a kid asking for a vacuum cleaner! I thought I gave her the example of powerful women in the workplace, going out and doing their thing and this child of mine wanted a vacuum cleaner? Well, I bought her one, much to my chagrin, because SHE ASKED FOR IT. Your niece didn\u2019t ask for it. Or the cooking set.

I\u2019m sure you were well intentioned and if the kid liked the gifts, honestly no big deal. But the mom is right, buying girls cleaning/caretaking toys (juxtaposed against \u201cnormal\u201d toys bought at the same time for a boy) is both a little sexist and very out of fashion.\n\nThink about it this way - you got her a makeup set and him a science set. What does this say about your impression of her future/her interests? Unless specifically asked for it illustrates your expectations for her.\n\nThere\u2019s a TV that deals with this a little, F is for Family.

This may not have been something conscious on your part, as we were ALL raised with gender-biased gifts.  \"Girls clean and cook; boys build things.\"  However - times have been changing, and enforcing those historical societal gender roles are no longer really approved of unless the child wants those things.  IE - boys playing with dolls, girls building rockets.  Just a lesson learned to either explore what your niece and nephew's interests are and feed those interests or stick to less gender-specific gifts.", "YTA. \n\nThey are sexist gifts.

Last Christmas I asked the 6 year old for ideas and the first thing she asked for was a chemistry set. My 4 year old nephew is the only one who plays with the giant expensive kitchen set my brother bought for the kids to share. He likes to pretend to cook for everyone. Why are you so concerned about which gender a toy is marketed to rather than what the kids might actually be interested in?", "In what universe are science toys, dinosaurs and trucks for BOYS only?\n\nThis is where you keep cementing the YTA judgement of most posters.\n\nI don't know of any stores where there are 'girls' and 'boys' sections anymore. There are just *Toys*, organized by category.\n\nLet me explain, in very, very clear examples:\n\nTrucks and Cars will be near each other. These are for Boys and Girls.\n\nPink vacuums and kitchen sets will be near each other. These are for Boys and Girls.\n\nScience Toys are near other STEM toys. These are for Boys and Girls.\n\nDolls will be near doll clothes and accessories. These are for Boys and Girls.\n\nThemed toys, such as Minecraft and Roblox will be near each other. These are for Boys and Girls.\n\nAll toys are for all kids. YOU chose to believe that only Girls play with cleaning supplies and want to raise babies while play cooking.  YOU chose to believe only Boys would want STEM activities and cool dinosaurs and trucks.\n\nThis is ALL ON YOU for making these gender assumptions. Stop blaming it on how the store categorized toys near other like toys.\n\nYTA.", "Your. Cousins. Are. Not. Genetically. Identical. \n\nTherefore, calling them identical is wrong.", "I think it\u2019s also just part of the Reddit mob mentality to do so. You guys do you though. For the record I agree with OP\u2019s sister.", "I guess she could have, but, I simply picked those for my nephew because I found them in the toy section for boys.", ">will the science kit explode if your niece touches\n\nThe absence of a penis causes any scientific or building toy to explode on contact, especially if it's blue", "Ok here\u2019s an example. The dinosaur truck had a picture of boys playing with it on the box. As did a lot of other toys in that section where boys were depicted playing with those toys. And if they were in the section that appeared to be for boys, then of course I\u2019m going to assume that the toys in that section are geared towards boys. It\u2019s really as simple as that.", " Wow. Absolutely horrifying. YTA. You said you got \u201ceach of them a sea themed gift\u201d. The gift you got the girl was a dress. A fucking dress while the boy gets an educational, fun, enriching kit. \n\nThat shows how you see women. You got her toys to teach her how to cook, clean, and do makeup at 6 years old. Because a 6 year old girl needs to start learning early to look pretty, right? \n\nAnd your comment replies are dense. Have some critical thinking skills. There\u2019s no reason that toys should be boy or girl and the fact that you think that way is already sexist.", "How is that the boys' section?", "Omg\u2026\ud83d\ude44", "You need to work out whatever issues you have around gender because it\u2019s pretty bad how you can\u2019t see how what you did wasn\u2019t ok. Men still cook and clean right? They can become teachers or parents and take care of babies right? So how was the cleaning and cooking toys and doll not ok for the boy? Oh because you have deeply rooted stereotypes ingrained into you and some toxic masculinity if you think your nephew shouldn\u2019t play with anyone of these things. YTA", "Well he also got her a dolphin themed makeup kit. So she can do her make up like dolphins do. /s", "Don't you know that the pink aisle is for girls and all the rest of the toy aisles are for boys?? /s", "OP is assuming the STEM toys are boys only toys, my guess."]}
