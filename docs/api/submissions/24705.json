I'm very happy with it and proud of my work. I have two employees who work part time and for the most part it's just me. \n\nMy SIL approached me at the beginning of the summer and asked if I would let my niece (F11) help out in the bakery over the school break. She has been getting really into baking and loves watching content creators baking and was apparently just dying to be able to job shadow/help out in a bakery. \n\nI was hesitant, but said yes. And I hated it. Every single minute that her niece spent in my bakery this summer was the only time I've ever had any regrets opening my business. Whatever the opposite of helpful was, that was what my niece was. My employees didn't enjoy her being there, and I didn't enjoy her being there at all. We were three very grumpy people all summer. I had hopes that she would get better, but she didn't. \n\nShe started back to school last this week and I have never felt so relieved. I thought many times about telling my SIL that she couldn't come back during the summer, but since I had made the promise, I kept up with it. \n\nMy SIL stopped by the house yesterday to drop something off for my husband. She told me my niece had absolutely loved her experience this summer and wanted to know if she could come back a couple Saturdays a month. I told her that unfortunately that wasn't going to work and that going forward I didn't think it was a good idea for my niece to help out. I told her it just wasn't productive for us. \n\nMy SIL was very unhappy. She told me that my niece had loved her summer at the bakery and was so looking forward to continuing. I told her that I was sorry, but I had a business to run and couldn't continue having her help out. This dissolved into a shouting match that my husband eventually broke up. My SIL and MIL have been sending me nasty messages about \"breaking a girl's heart.\" My husband said my niece called him and was very upset, but he stands by me and understands that I can't let this bring down my workplace. \n\nSo am I being the asshole?", "created_utc": 1692119430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ryj13/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_help_in_my_bakery/", "score": 8347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA *but* there are things from this whole ordeal that you need to learn from as while your actions were not AH behavior, they were stupid.\n\nIt was foolish to go along with this to begin with.  Idk where you live but an 11 year old working in that environment would almost certainly violate child labor laws in most places and it\u2019s kind of a miracle you survived the whole summer without someone making a phone call or review that could have put your whole business in jeoprady.\n\nIt also sounds like you *never* told your SIL or her daughther that there was even any problems and played along.

She really blew that and is a complete asshole for not simply speaking with her daughter to reassure her that it was good while it lasted, but how they need to respect others' time and business.\n\nIf this is really important, your SIL and MIL can bake with her daughter in her own kitchen.

Did you ever communicate your frustrations to her or her mother? Without not info, I'm going with slight yta for not communicating with anyone that she was doing anything wrong.

Unless she was running around throwing flour in the air or something, I don't even know lol.", "NTA.  Dude, why did you get into a screaming match?  Niece is costing you business, that's the one and only reason you need to tell SIL no, there's nothing else to talk about, the exit is right over there!

It could be that you can use that as a perfect excuse not to have her back for a few years!

Like, you should have let SIL it wasn't working WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY before now, so that declining your niece helping out any further wasn't a shock, because a shock feels like an attack. Blindsiding her with it... not a great move.\n\nAgain: you're not an asshole for wanting your work place to go back to normal. YTA because you completely blindsided a child and her mom, instead of addressing issues as they happened.

You probably violated child labor laws, health codes, and other laws as well.", "INFO What was your niece doing that was so bad? There are a lot of tasks that an 11 year old can do easily.", "NTA\n\nThere are definitely laws against having someone that young in the workplace. And even if she was old enough to have a job and be in the kitchen, if she's costing you money getting in your employees way and hindering the way your job works it's not worth it. It's an OSHA violation, it's a safety hazard, it's it's a health code violation. I've been cooking for 19 years professionally. You made the right decision", "I have no idea how it became one either. My SIL is super, super sensitive where my niece is concerned so she immediately went on the defensive.", "She really wasn't working. She was job shadowing. I didn't let her do much if anything and I made sure she wasn't there for very long.", "She probably was just in the way, as I can't imagine there would be much she could do in a fast paced environment.  If OP were having to stop to correct her or help her with something, it would slow her down, frustrating customers & everyone trying to work around her in the kitchen.", "I agree with you. We (my employees and I) really felt like it destroyed our image a bit. But we are in a smaller town and there are several shops/restaurants around town where that's tolerated so it's not 100% out of place where we are. But not something I personally like.", "I also want to know what exactly did she do to upset everyone?", "Oh yeah I am taking those saints out to a steak dinner next week.", "I had a few conversations with my sister in law about my niece and how she was acting. What it boils down to is my niece is EXTREMELY immature for her age. It was like having a 5 year old in our commercial kitchen. My SIL is very sensitive regarding my niece to the point that it's obnoxious.", "My niece is extremely immature for her age. She's 11 but honestly acts like a 5 year old. She was constantly underfoot, constantly throwing tantrums, constantly having to be watched and/or told what to do and what not to do (hundreds of times). She was also loud and demanding and entitled. She ate enough of my product over the summer that she put a dent in my profits. She just completely sucked to be around and drained our normally really fun and happy work environment.", "I'll burn my business to the ground before having her back. LoL. Yes we were very careful about labor laws. I never really had her do anything outside of a \"job shadowing\" capacity and never let her stay for more than a handful of hours but that was more than enough.", "Yeah, was it a \"she didn't care about what I was saying and almost burned an employee 4 times\" type of awful or just a \"she is 11 and obviously cannot work like an actual employee\" type of awful?", "To her credit, she does that as well! She just wanted her to get experience in a real business.", "That's the answer I was searching for: 11 is too young to work in a professional environment. Whether she burned the cookies or didn't keep up with the pace of the job, it was inconvenient for OP, who was running a business.\n\nSIL shouldn't have asked for her pre-teen child to work, and OP shouldn't have accepted.", "She was only there a handful of hours a week. I did not let her spend the whole summer there. LoL", "I will say that while I don\u2019t think I agree with a y t a verdict OP definitley screwed up in never communicating this beforehand, or better yet agreeing to go along with this to begin with. Depending on where she lives having an 11 year old work there could be illegal and jeaopradize her business", "Not this one apparently. LoL. I didn't really let her do much because I did not want to violate any labor laws. But even the tiniest tasks that I would give to her became a literal nightmare.", "Yep! We really didn't let her do anything because I didn't want to be in violation of labor laws, but she was STILL in the way.", "I didn't even think about the age part. Either way, NTA. Business is business, it is not your job to babysit an incompetent and underage employee.", "Well, what did your niece do that was so terrible while working for you. You didn\u2019t give any context or even 1 example.", "Well she shouldn't have been in the kitchen at all. She can help with frosting and be up by the counter, but an 11 year old has no place in a commercial kitchen. Beyond that, then nta because you shared the issues with sil and she just ignored them. It shouldn't have been a surprise that you didn't want her back after telling her the whole time that she wasn't productive or helpful.", "I would have sent her home after the first tantrum.", "IMHO the girl is too young to help out. Maybe in sever years if she still will be interested and then you can have rules and requirements. And still it can become nasty. \n\nYour SIL can find her some after school activities or groups related to baking", "I don't think OP would jeopardize their business by having a niece that helps out. She's not setting hours or anything and it's a voluntary thing the niece enjoyed, so I don't think it would have been a legal issue, but I'm an accountant not a lawyer, so grain of salt and all that.\n\nI stand by my verdict because of the kid involved. If OP's issues had been brought up sooner, niece could have been coached and maybe done better, or it could have been determined that she wasn't old enough to help out yet. OP's silence on these issues means that what niece thought was a great experience was actually her failing at something she really enjoyed doing, and the knowledge that no one even gave her the chance to do better. It's likely to taint the whole memory, and it will be a huge hit to her self-esteem. It's not OP's fault niece wasn't good at helping at the bakery, but the hit to niece's self esteem is definitely on OP... at least in my opinion, for what it's worth.\n\nI 100% back OP's right to have a workplace that is childfree and they have every right to not have niece back... but the way this was handled was just bad... and niece is the one that gets hurt because of it. It didn't have to happen this way, and for that, I vote OP is TA... I don't think they're malicious or necessarily bad people, but in this instance, they are the bad guy... doesn't make them a *bad guy* in general, though.", "I applaud you for trying to ne nice to your niece.  But business is business.", "According to labor laws and OSHA standards it would be about the age.  That's illegal AF", "I love how many people are like, \"wElL wHy WaS sHe So UnHeLpFuL? wHaT mAdE iT sO uNeNjOyAbLe?\" Dude, it's a 3 person staffed bakery and she's ELEVEN. I'm no pro-baker and I can figure it out, lol, you guys don't have time to be teaching a kid and fixing the errors that ANY eleven year old would understandably make on a learning curve... it's not like you have 20 more staff to pick up the slack. The stress levels must have been off the charts having to add babysitter and teacher to an already full time job, what could POSSIBLY have been enjoyable about that for any of you? NTA.", "NTA. You and your employees did not enjoy having your niece around. The weekends are probably busy for you and you can't have your employees leave. You are running a business.  An 11 year old in a commercial kitchen is not a great idea, labor laws aside.\n\nAnd lastly if your SIL needs a babysitter, she can hire one that bakes and your niece can make cookies at home.", "NTA. As per your comments, you did speak to SiIL about it and she doesn't care. Your niece is 11 but acts like a 5 year old....and you are right. A commercial kitchen is no place for a child.\n\nEdit to add: She threw tantrums, refused to help and ate everything in sight. Do not let her come back.", "NTA, it's a commercial bakery not a fuck around Gymboree. Sounds like they are mad the free babysitting is over. \n\nI've worked in commercial kitchens, it is not a place for 11 year old children.

Explain to your sister in law that at the moment it's not practical for you to be teaching an 11 year old your trade when your trying to run a business & that when she is older & more productive, then if she still wants too, you will consider taking her on a trial. Don't say it's a never again thing, just not right now.", "NTA this is a business, not a day care", "NTA, she's missing the free childcare.", "What does your insurance say?

Sometimes work like that is just intense and given the situation it can be hard to find your place or keep up.

That is more than enough time to load a dish washer, wipe down the counters, and, depending on time maybe* hand wash the big stuff.\n\n\n\n*I say maybe because the last bit of backing requires some watching, and a kid would be distracted with the sweets. The hand washing could be done during the cooling period.", "I guess 11-year-olds vary, but I'm surprised she couldn't clean or cashier. Then again, if she's a particularly immature or incompetent sort of 11-year-old, then I could see that being outside of her capabilities.\n\nLots of kids, at that age, could handle almost any sort of non highly skilled task, like retrieving things or organizing stuff etc, but then some others are just going to be a total disaster. Unfortunately, even if she thinks she likes baking, it seems like she's the latter.\n\nThen there's always the 12-year-old Wonder kid type who can make Instagram worthy decorated cookies without any help. Her mother probably thinks that's what she's got on her hands, even when it decidedly is not.", "Honestly, I think people are only reacting that way because they view a woman-run bakery as soft, women\u2019s work, rather than the professional workplace that it is.\n\nNo one would ask me those questions if I said an 11 yo couldn\u2019t hang around my office for entire workdays to try and help me do project estimates and run data through Excel and PowerBI. They\u2019d be like, OF COURSE A CHILD CAN\u2019T HELP WITH YOUR JOB AND CAN ONLY MAKE YOU LESS EFFICIENT BY BEING THERE.", "I run a small business and learned very quickly to set firm boundaries with anyone I was sharing a stall with.\n\nYes, I will mind your half while you grab lunch or have a quick look at whatever caught your eye.\nNo, I will not spend an hour or more running your stall as well as mine.", "Just give them the cash you would have spent on the dinner.", "My stupid ex used to let his 6 yr old serve customers and handle their food - it lost us so much business because it was slow, unsanitary and unprofessional.", "God i would be so pissed if you were my boss. Why on earth did you let her stay all summer if your employees were miserable? Idiocy.", "Yep, it's a business not a play kitchen.", "Throwing tantrums at ELEVEN?  Good lord.   That is so beyond inappropriate in a work environment, I can't even imagine your frustration.  And then her parents and your MIL have the audacity to try and guilt trip you because you don't want to turn your small business into a daycare for them?  Good god, no wonder your niece acts the way she does with those two as parents.", "Hence your niece\u2019s attitude. She really is doing her a disservice. But alas, not your responsibility, you\u2019ve done more than enough already! You\u2019re absolutely NTA and I love your username.", "She's eleven, she doesn't even NEED a sitter. Her mother just wanted time to herself and probably free baked goods.", "A sitter who likes to bake! Imagine that!", ">as long as a parent is with her to watch her and keep her out of your way.\n\nTHIS part! One of her parents needs to come with her to supervise. If they also observe how *not helpful* she is, it is a bonus to you.", "From other comments the kid wasn\u2019t actually around all that often \u201ccouple hours a week\u201d", "If OP had said yes, sis would probably have started a conversation about wages", "OP should send her a bill. The ingratitude and entitlement is insane.", "I just wonder of SIL asked OP to pay the niece.", "Oh no no no, don't open that can of worms.", "Honestly a nice dinner can be good as long as like you said there is a nice cash bonus also. Employers like it for the team building and it seems like everyone got a long well at ops place.", "The laws don't change the fact that in OP's specific case, having the 11yo niece in the bakery was doing more harm than help!!", "Most of those family business exemptions specify that the parents have to be the owners, not just any random relative.", "Did you later get chosen as tribute?", "Or, they could approach OP about paid private lessons at home, the first time.", "Also the cost of ingredients can really add up if a kid is experimenting, or trying to bake new things ever day. Much better if the niece can play around with ingredients her parents don't have to pay for.", "Who is surely losing money by her presence, could have lost her employees, and surely spent more on ingredients those months because the kid probably got it all over the place. Not to mention baking has to be done exactly the same every time because chemistry.", "Oh totally, but it need to be an \u201cand\u201dsituation, not an \u201cor\u201d situation. We know what the employees need. The employer also needs to do some good team bonding due to their actions so they should probably do both.", "Exactly. I worked for a catering company as a prep cook for a few years. Everything is big, huge, heavy, and has a real potential to hurt a little girl like that. Plus your ingredients are in bulk quantities.\n\nSo an 11 year old girl is at risk in commercial kitchens, even just if she's under foot and somebody is coming through with hot pans or a sack of flour. But she's also not going to be much \"help\" and if anything that is an extra burden on everyone, more than just being a little kid who you can't speak openly around or who some may think is annoying. She's there bc she wants to do the fun and age-appropriate stuff, while a majority of the work is *not* decorating or mixing batter. She should have parents teaching her or learning with her how to bake at her age, not professionals during their workdays. Plus, she's young enough that she can't possibly be doing everything safely and correctly, and I'd be willing to doubt that any decorating she does is nowhere near their usual product quality. So these people are trying to do their jobs, but they also have to: keep an eye out to make sure they don't accidentally run into her and maim her; spend time showing her techniques and making sure she can measure correctly and handle ingredients safely; handle most if not all of her hot line tasks (in/out of oven, making compotes on the stove, etc.); probably a fair bit of cleaning up after her; and only having kid-friendly conversations all day.\n\nThen, when she makes things you'd expect a little kid to make, even one with some extra experience and guidance, I can't imagine that they could display everything she's making, let alone sell it, so that's got a big potential to not just fail to make the business money, but to *cost* them the value of the ingredients and time that was used in making them. And this is all *on top* of their actual jobs making the same amount of items they always do, despite having niece there to \"help\". So she may be a wonderful baker for her age and I applaud her, her mom, and OP for wanting to grow that talent and passion, but I'm frankly shocked that OP allowed this in the first place. Maybe on days when the bakery is closed (and even that'd be super generous of OP to give up their off days to basically be doing their normal job + babysitting), but having this kid there ALL day, ALL summer, is dangerous and burdensome. \n\nAnd SIL had so much gall to put all of that on OP, ask them to keep having her back to play \"apprentice,\" and then to blow up at this generous person who'd already given SO much for this kid just in this few months of what is surely a GREAT 11 years-long aunt-niece relationship and sic the flying monkey-in-law on them.\n\nI got way beyond the scope of y'alls replies but I just got so mad thinking about this more. I worked at that caterer from 14-18 and as I got older, the new 14 y/o hires really made my job more difficult even if they were competent, bc there's still a TON of babysitting you have to do while they learn. I would have lost my absolute *gourd* if I had anyone younger than that (essentially) under my charge and I applaud OP for their patience and the other bakers' patience in letting that go on so long!\n\nEdited bc I hit post too soon lol", "\ud83e\udd23 Probably it would be the height of an average counter, the only thing I\u2019d be scared of are the pots and pans hanging above counters (my 13 y.o. Body that\u2019s only 5,4 can\u2019t even reach cabinets)", "Yeah I was cleaning up my dad\u2019s construction sites since I can remember. By the time I was 10 I was using power tools and framing walls. We built different \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24"]}
