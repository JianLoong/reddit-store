I'm very happy with it and proud of my work. I have two employees who work part time and for the most part it's just me. \n\nMy SIL approached me at the beginning of the summer and asked if I would let my niece (F11) help out in the bakery over the school break. She has been getting really into baking and loves watching content creators baking and was apparently just dying to be able to job shadow/help out in a bakery. \n\nI was hesitant, but said yes. And I hated it. Every single minute that her niece spent in my bakery this summer was the only time I've ever had any regrets opening my business. Whatever the opposite of helpful was, that was what my niece was. My employees didn't enjoy her being there, and I didn't enjoy her being there at all. We were three very grumpy people all summer. I had hopes that she would get better, but she didn't. \n\nShe started back to school last this week and I have never felt so relieved. I thought many times about telling my SIL that she couldn't come back during the summer, but since I had made the promise, I kept up with it. \n\nMy SIL stopped by the house yesterday to drop something off for my husband. She told me my niece had absolutely loved her experience this summer and wanted to know if she could come back a couple Saturdays a month. I told her that unfortunately that wasn't going to work and that going forward I didn't think it was a good idea for my niece to help out. I told her it just wasn't productive for us. \n\nMy SIL was very unhappy. She told me that my niece had loved her summer at the bakery and was so looking forward to continuing. I told her that I was sorry, but I had a business to run and couldn't continue having her help out. This dissolved into a shouting match that my husband eventually broke up. My SIL and MIL have been sending me nasty messages about \"breaking a girl's heart.\" My husband said my niece called him and was very upset, but he stands by me and understands that I can't let this bring down my workplace. \n\nSo am I being the asshole?", "created_utc": 1692119430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ryj13/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_help_in_my_bakery/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA *but* there are things from this whole ordeal that you need to learn from as while your actions were not AH behavior, they were stupid.\n\nIt was foolish to go along with this to begin with.  Idk where you live but an 11 year old working in that environment would almost certainly violate child labor laws in most places and it\u2019s kind of a miracle you survived the whole summer without someone making a phone call or review that could have put your whole business in jeoprady.\n\nIt also sounds like you *never* told your SIL or her daughther that there was even any problems and played along. That was a mistake, you should have said something FOREVER ago and not blindside her when she asked for Saturdays.

Maybe offer to spend some time baking with her, or maybe just have her clean surfaces in the front, & greet customers?  Either way, I've worked in food service enough to know that the kitchen is no place for an 11 yr old, specifically when you have a rush.  SIL & BIL should understand that.", "What kinds of things was she doing to make it not enjoyable/productive for you?", "I need more information as to why it wasn\u2019t enjoyable.", "NTA. Was your SIL looking for a bit of free babysitting? Because your place of business is no place to run a child care service.", "NTA. At the end of the day, you have a business to run. Not sure what made the girl unhelpful, but if it was negatively impacting your ability to conduct your business then you make the call. You weren\u2019t rude about it.

Also, this is pretty vague. Did she make a lot of mistakes, or did she have tantrums and throw cake on the floor? Was she badly behaved or just incapable of doing anything useful?\n\nSince you let the entire summer pass without addressing the issues, I'm inclined to say ESH. But if I had to pick the bigger AH it would definitely be your SIL who sounds unbearable.", "NTA.\n\nYou clearly gave this an honest chance, and you can rest easily knowing that your niece loved her time there (even if you didn't - that's still a nice bit of consolation).  \n\nSIL is completely out of line for demanding more, she needs to graciously accept your \"no\". She really blew that and is a complete asshole for not simply speaking with her daughter to reassure her that it was good while it lasted, but how they need to respect others' time and business.\n\nIf this is really important, your SIL and MIL can bake with her daughter in her own kitchen. I'm guessing they've already tried that and much prefer it done where someone else is responsible.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t safety/liability also effect things?", "NTA.  There are more age appropriate ways to nurture a love of baking in an 11 year old than trying to strong your SiL into accepting an unpaid (and woefully unqualified) intern.\n\nEdit: That said, OP probably should have said something over the summer.", "Info: why was she unhelpful? Did you ever communicate your frustrations to her or her mother? Without not info, I'm going with slight yta for not communicating with anyone that she was doing anything wrong. If you just blindly pretended everything was great just to make her feel good, it's on you that she didn't improve and now you're forcing her to deal with the consequences instead of giving her a chance to improve.", "INFO: What were the behaviors that weren't helpful? You need to be specific with SIL to help her understand.", "You're kind of vague with the details of how exactly she \"wasn't helpful\". What did she do that was so terrible to warrant this much of a strong reaction? You're allowed to say no of course, it just seems really weird how angry you are about her presence there. Unless she was running around throwing flour in the air or something, I don't even know lol.", "NTA.  Dude, why did you get into a screaming match?  Niece is costing you business, that's the one and only reason you need to tell SIL no, there's nothing else to talk about, the exit is right over there!  Don't get into debates, let alone arguments, with family that are trying to take money out of your pocket AND create an unpleasant work atmosphere.

It could be that you can use that as a perfect excuse not to have her back for a few years! Child labour is generally frowned upon.", "NTA - Its a business and not day care, also staff should not suffer.", "NTA. You have a business to run. You shouldn't mix family and business anyways, and this is exactly why", "Well nta but you didn\u2019t say anything about why she was so awful?", "NTA. If her mother is so keen to foster her interest, why does she not buy her some baking supplies and bake with her at home instead of dumping her on you for free childcare while you're trying to run a business?", "INFO: How did the girl behave?", "11-years-old in a work place is absolutely never her helping you, it's you babysitting her. Nice experience for the kid and parents, I'm sure, and cheaper than any hobby...\n\nNTA.", "NTA unhelpful is unhelpful, I probably wouldn't have let her stay thru the summer.", "NTA.  You are running a business, not a school, charity, or daycare.", "NTA.to be honest if you were hesitant from the start you could have just said no and this all wouldn't have happened", "NTA. You run a business, not a middle school. It\u2019s okay to let a kid spend a couple hours shadowing you, but a whole summer was over the top.

Like, you should have let SIL it wasn't working WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY before now, so that declining your niece helping out any further wasn't a shock, because a shock feels like an attack. Blindsiding her with it... not a great move.\n\nAgain: you're not an asshole for wanting your work place to go back to normal. YTA because you completely blindsided a child and her mom, instead of addressing issues as they happened. It's poor communication.", "NTA for saying no now, but you kinda were TA for saying yes in the first place. You probably violated child labor laws, health codes, and other laws as well.", "INFO What was your niece doing that was so bad? There are a lot of tasks that an 11 year old can do easily.", "NTA\n\nThere are definitely laws against having someone that young in the workplace. And even if she was old enough to have a job and be in the kitchen, if she's costing you money getting in your employees way and hindering the way your job works it's not worth it. It's an OSHA violation, it's a safety hazard, it's it's a health code violation. I've been cooking for 19 years professionally. You made the right decision", "I have no idea how it became one either. My SIL is super, super sensitive where my niece is concerned so she immediately went on the defensive.", "She really wasn't working. She was job shadowing. I didn't let her do much if anything and I made sure she wasn't there for very long.", "She probably was just in the way, as I can't imagine there would be much she could do in a fast paced environment.  If OP were having to stop to correct her or help her with something, it would slow her down, frustrating customers & everyone trying to work around her in the kitchen.", "I agree with you. We (my employees and I) really felt like it destroyed our image a bit. But we are in a smaller town and there are several shops/restaurants around town where that's tolerated so it's not 100% out of place where we are. But not something I personally like.", "I also want to know what exactly did she do to upset everyone?", "Oh yeah I am taking those saints out to a steak dinner next week.", "I had a few conversations with my sister in law about my niece and how she was acting. What it boils down to is my niece is EXTREMELY immature for her age. It was like having a 5 year old in our commercial kitchen. My SIL is very sensitive regarding my niece to the point that it's obnoxious.", "My niece is extremely immature for her age. She's 11 but honestly acts like a 5 year old. She was constantly underfoot, constantly throwing tantrums, constantly having to be watched and/or told what to do and what not to do (hundreds of times). She was also loud and demanding and entitled. She ate enough of my product over the summer that she put a dent in my profits. She just completely sucked to be around and drained our normally really fun and happy work environment.", "I'll burn my business to the ground before having her back. LoL. Yes we were very careful about labor laws. I never really had her do anything outside of a \"job shadowing\" capacity and never let her stay for more than a handful of hours but that was more than enough.", "Yeah, was it a \"she didn't care about what I was saying and almost burned an employee 4 times\" type of awful or just a \"she is 11 and obviously cannot work like an actual employee\" type of awful?", "To her credit, she does that as well! She just wanted her to get experience in a real business.", "That's the answer I was searching for: 11 is too young to work in a professional environment. Whether she burned the cookies or didn't keep up with the pace of the job, it was inconvenient for OP, who was running a business.\n\nSIL shouldn't have asked for her pre-teen child to work, and OP shouldn't have accepted.", "She was only there a handful of hours a week. I did not let her spend the whole summer there. LoL", "I will say that while I don\u2019t think I agree with a y t a verdict OP definitley screwed up in never communicating this beforehand, or better yet agreeing to go along with this to begin with. Depending on where she lives having an 11 year old work there could be illegal and jeaopradize her business", "Not this one apparently. LoL. I didn't really let her do much because I did not want to violate any labor laws. But even the tiniest tasks that I would give to her became a literal nightmare.", "Yep! We really didn't let her do anything because I didn't want to be in violation of labor laws, but she was STILL in the way.", "I didn't even think about the age part. Either way, NTA. Business is business, it is not your job to babysit an incompetent and underage employee.", "Well, what did your niece do that was so terrible while working for you. You didn\u2019t give any context or even 1 example.", "Well she shouldn't have been in the kitchen at all. She can help with frosting and be up by the counter, but an 11 year old has no place in a commercial kitchen. Beyond that, then nta because you shared the issues with sil and she just ignored them. It shouldn't have been a surprise that you didn't want her back after telling her the whole time that she wasn't productive or helpful.", "I would have sent her home after the first tantrum.", "IMHO the girl is too young to help out. Maybe in sever years if she still will be interested and then you can have rules and requirements. And still it can become nasty. \n\nYour SIL can find her some after school activities or groups related to baking", "I don't think OP would jeopardize their business by having a niece that helps out. She's not setting hours or anything and it's a voluntary thing the niece enjoyed, so I don't think it would have been a legal issue, but I'm an accountant not a lawyer, so grain of salt and all that.\n\nI stand by my verdict because of the kid involved. If OP's issues had been brought up sooner, niece could have been coached and maybe done better, or it could have been determined that she wasn't old enough to help out yet. OP's silence on these issues means that what niece thought was a great experience was actually her failing at something she really enjoyed doing, and the knowledge that no one even gave her the chance to do better. It's likely to taint the whole memory, and it will be a huge hit to her self-esteem. It's not OP's fault niece wasn't good at helping at the bakery, but the hit to niece's self esteem is definitely on OP... at least in my opinion, for what it's worth.\n\nI 100% back OP's right to have a workplace that is childfree and they have every right to not have niece back... but the way this was handled was just bad... and niece is the one that gets hurt because of it. It didn't have to happen this way, and for that, I vote OP is TA... I don't think they're malicious or necessarily bad people, but in this instance, they are the bad guy... doesn't make them a *bad guy* in general, though.", "I applaud you for trying to ne nice to your niece.  But business is business.", "According to labor laws and OSHA standards it would be about the age.  That's illegal AF"]}
