I'm very happy with it and proud of my work. I have two employees who work part time and for the most part it's just me. \n\nMy SIL approached me at the beginning of the summer and asked if I would let my niece (F11) help out in the bakery over the school break. She has been getting really into baking and loves watching content creators baking and was apparently just dying to be able to job shadow/help out in a bakery. \n\nI was hesitant, but said yes. And I hated it. Every single minute that her niece spent in my bakery this summer was the only time I've ever had any regrets opening my business. Whatever the opposite of helpful was, that was what my niece was. My employees didn't enjoy her being there, and I didn't enjoy her being there at all. We were three very grumpy people all summer. I had hopes that she would get better, but she didn't. \n\nShe started back to school last this week and I have never felt so relieved. I thought many times about telling my SIL that she couldn't come back during the summer, but since I had made the promise, I kept up with it. \n\nMy SIL stopped by the house yesterday to drop something off for my husband. She told me my niece had absolutely loved her experience this summer and wanted to know if she could come back a couple Saturdays a month. I told her that unfortunately that wasn't going to work and that going forward I didn't think it was a good idea for my niece to help out. I told her it just wasn't productive for us. \n\nMy SIL was very unhappy. She told me that my niece had loved her summer at the bakery and was so looking forward to continuing. I told her that I was sorry, but I had a business to run and couldn't continue having her help out. This dissolved into a shouting match that my husband eventually broke up. My SIL and MIL have been sending me nasty messages about \"breaking a girl's heart.\" My husband said my niece called him and was very upset, but he stands by me and understands that I can't let this bring down my workplace. \n\nSo am I being the asshole?", "created_utc": 1692119430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ryj13/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_help_in_my_bakery/", "score": 1094, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA *but* there are things from this whole ordeal that you need to learn from as while your actions were not AH behavior, they were stupid.\n\nIt was foolish to go along with this to begin with.  Idk where you live but an 11 year old working in that environment would almost certainly violate child labor laws in most places and it\u2019s kind of a miracle you survived the whole summer without someone making a phone call or review that could have put your whole business in jeoprady.\n\nIt also sounds like you *never* told your SIL or her daughther that there was even any problems and played along.

Also, this is pretty vague. Did she make a lot of mistakes, or did she have tantrums and throw cake on the floor?

She really blew that and is a complete asshole for not simply speaking with her daughter to reassure her that it was good while it lasted, but how they need to respect others' time and business.\n\nIf this is really important, your SIL and MIL can bake with her daughter in her own kitchen.

Did you ever communicate your frustrations to her or her mother? Without not info, I'm going with slight yta for not communicating with anyone that she was doing anything wrong.

Unless she was running around throwing flour in the air or something, I don't even know lol.", "NTA.  Dude, why did you get into a screaming match?  Niece is costing you business, that's the one and only reason you need to tell SIL no, there's nothing else to talk about, the exit is right over there!

It could be that you can use that as a perfect excuse not to have her back for a few years!

Like, you should have let SIL it wasn't working WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY before now, so that declining your niece helping out any further wasn't a shock, because a shock feels like an attack. Blindsiding her with it... not a great move.\n\nAgain: you're not an asshole for wanting your work place to go back to normal. YTA because you completely blindsided a child and her mom, instead of addressing issues as they happened.

You probably violated child labor laws, health codes, and other laws as well.", "INFO What was your niece doing that was so bad? There are a lot of tasks that an 11 year old can do easily.", "NTA\n\nThere are definitely laws against having someone that young in the workplace. And even if she was old enough to have a job and be in the kitchen, if she's costing you money getting in your employees way and hindering the way your job works it's not worth it. It's an OSHA violation, it's a safety hazard, it's it's a health code violation. I've been cooking for 19 years professionally. You made the right decision", "I have no idea how it became one either. My SIL is super, super sensitive where my niece is concerned so she immediately went on the defensive.", "She really wasn't working. She was job shadowing. I didn't let her do much if anything and I made sure she wasn't there for very long.", "She probably was just in the way, as I can't imagine there would be much she could do in a fast paced environment.  If OP were having to stop to correct her or help her with something, it would slow her down, frustrating customers & everyone trying to work around her in the kitchen.", "I agree with you. We (my employees and I) really felt like it destroyed our image a bit. But we are in a smaller town and there are several shops/restaurants around town where that's tolerated so it's not 100% out of place where we are. But not something I personally like.", "I also want to know what exactly did she do to upset everyone?", "Oh yeah I am taking those saints out to a steak dinner next week.", "I had a few conversations with my sister in law about my niece and how she was acting. What it boils down to is my niece is EXTREMELY immature for her age. It was like having a 5 year old in our commercial kitchen. My SIL is very sensitive regarding my niece to the point that it's obnoxious.", "My niece is extremely immature for her age. She's 11 but honestly acts like a 5 year old. She was constantly underfoot, constantly throwing tantrums, constantly having to be watched and/or told what to do and what not to do (hundreds of times). She was also loud and demanding and entitled. She ate enough of my product over the summer that she put a dent in my profits. She just completely sucked to be around and drained our normally really fun and happy work environment.", "I'll burn my business to the ground before having her back. LoL. Yes we were very careful about labor laws. I never really had her do anything outside of a \"job shadowing\" capacity and never let her stay for more than a handful of hours but that was more than enough.", "Yeah, was it a \"she didn't care about what I was saying and almost burned an employee 4 times\" type of awful or just a \"she is 11 and obviously cannot work like an actual employee\" type of awful?", "To her credit, she does that as well! She just wanted her to get experience in a real business.", "That's the answer I was searching for: 11 is too young to work in a professional environment. Whether she burned the cookies or didn't keep up with the pace of the job, it was inconvenient for OP, who was running a business.\n\nSIL shouldn't have asked for her pre-teen child to work, and OP shouldn't have accepted.", "She was only there a handful of hours a week. I did not let her spend the whole summer there. LoL", "I will say that while I don\u2019t think I agree with a y t a verdict OP definitley screwed up in never communicating this beforehand, or better yet agreeing to go along with this to begin with. Depending on where she lives having an 11 year old work there could be illegal and jeaopradize her business", "Not this one apparently. LoL. I didn't really let her do much because I did not want to violate any labor laws. But even the tiniest tasks that I would give to her became a literal nightmare.", "Yep! We really didn't let her do anything because I didn't want to be in violation of labor laws, but she was STILL in the way.", "I didn't even think about the age part. Either way, NTA. Business is business, it is not your job to babysit an incompetent and underage employee.", "Well, what did your niece do that was so terrible while working for you. You didn\u2019t give any context or even 1 example.", "Well she shouldn't have been in the kitchen at all. She can help with frosting and be up by the counter, but an 11 year old has no place in a commercial kitchen. Beyond that, then nta because you shared the issues with sil and she just ignored them. It shouldn't have been a surprise that you didn't want her back after telling her the whole time that she wasn't productive or helpful.", "I would have sent her home after the first tantrum.", "IMHO the girl is too young to help out. Maybe in sever years if she still will be interested and then you can have rules and requirements. And still it can become nasty. \n\nYour SIL can find her some after school activities or groups related to baking", "I don't think OP would jeopardize their business by having a niece that helps out. She's not setting hours or anything and it's a voluntary thing the niece enjoyed, so I don't think it would have been a legal issue, but I'm an accountant not a lawyer, so grain of salt and all that.\n\nI stand by my verdict because of the kid involved. If OP's issues had been brought up sooner, niece could have been coached and maybe done better, or it could have been determined that she wasn't old enough to help out yet. OP's silence on these issues means that what niece thought was a great experience was actually her failing at something she really enjoyed doing, and the knowledge that no one even gave her the chance to do better. It's likely to taint the whole memory, and it will be a huge hit to her self-esteem. It's not OP's fault niece wasn't good at helping at the bakery, but the hit to niece's self esteem is definitely on OP... at least in my opinion, for what it's worth.\n\nI 100% back OP's right to have a workplace that is childfree and they have every right to not have niece back... but the way this was handled was just bad... and niece is the one that gets hurt because of it. It didn't have to happen this way, and for that, I vote OP is TA... I don't think they're malicious or necessarily bad people, but in this instance, they are the bad guy... doesn't make them a *bad guy* in general, though.", "I applaud you for trying to ne nice to your niece.  But business is business.", "According to labor laws and OSHA standards it would be about the age.  That's illegal AF", "I love how many people are like, \"wElL wHy WaS sHe So UnHeLpFuL? wHaT mAdE iT sO uNeNjOyAbLe?\" Dude, it's a 3 person staffed bakery and she's ELEVEN. I'm no pro-baker and I can figure it out, lol, you guys don't have time to be teaching a kid and fixing the errors that ANY eleven year old would understandably make on a learning curve... it's not like you have 20 more staff to pick up the slack. The stress levels must have been off the charts having to add babysitter and teacher to an already full time job, what could POSSIBLY have been enjoyable about that for any of you? NTA.", "NTA. You and your employees did not enjoy having your niece around. The weekends are probably busy for you and you can't have your employees leave. You are running a business.  An 11 year old in a commercial kitchen is not a great idea, labor laws aside.\n\nAnd lastly if your SIL needs a babysitter, she can hire one that bakes and your niece can make cookies at home.", "NTA. As per your comments, you did speak to SiIL about it and she doesn't care. Your niece is 11 but acts like a 5 year old....and you are right. A commercial kitchen is no place for a child.\n\nEdit to add: She threw tantrums, refused to help and ate everything in sight. Do not let her come back.", "NTA, it's a commercial bakery not a fuck around Gymboree. Sounds like they are mad the free babysitting is over. \n\nI've worked in commercial kitchens, it is not a place for 11 year old children.

Explain to your sister in law that at the moment it's not practical for you to be teaching an 11 year old your trade when your trying to run a business & that when she is older & more productive, then if she still wants too, you will consider taking her on a trial. Don't say it's a never again thing, just not right now.", "NTA this is a business, not a day care", "NTA, she's missing the free childcare.", "What does your insurance say?

You know, you\u2019re using the word \u201cidiotic\u201d pretty liberally for someone who clearly lacks basic reading comprehension.", "I mean, there\u2019s only so much an 11yo can do without being next to an adult in an actual bakery w all the equipment. Not to mention the differences in capabilities to carry out labor tasks\n\nAnd chances are the niece thought it was a little fun activity and having a kid behind you constantly slowed down the work carried out by only 3 people", "This. She wanted free childcare, the bakery was a convenient excuse.", "In my province I was working at our government building as a page at the age of 12, so it is possible for younger pre/teens to work at a job & be expected to act professionally.  There were 22 of us working as pages & it was an administrative job which required a lot of work, (we had school onsite in the early morning).", "Yeah I was getting paid to break down cardboard boxes and crush cans at 10-12, that\u2019s it", "At 11, it\u2019s babysitting. And that\u2019s why mom cares.", "I volunteered at local non-profits from age 10 on.  Honestly I thrived in those spaces and they loved having me. They were fully adult workplaces, and I was expected to behave and work accordingly, but I definitely credit the adults for being able to break larger projects down into tasks I could do and actually be helpful. But it was also NOT food prep/service, which is a challenging profession even for many adults. All that to say: it\u2019s likely not an age thing, but a personality/interest/ability/maybe maturity? thing. OP definitely NTA regardless.", "If you can't haul 50 lb sacks of flour, you are a liability in a commercial bakery. I'm not surprised an 11 year old failed miserably.", "Lots of kids whose parents run a restaurant start very young.  I was cooking commercially at 10, but doing prep in the back.\n\nBut an 11-yr old in a small bakery who wasn\u2019t raised in it?  Sounds like a nightmare to me.  Definitely NTA.", "I'm having trouble coming up with tasks that an 11 year old could do in a professional bakery, tbh. Even removing tasks that deal with heat or machinery, everything at that scale is either too heavy or too high up. Unless the kid enjoys folding cake boxes for hours.", "Children can work at younger ages in family owned buisnesses.  Laws differ in diffrent states.  I know a local chinese place that had 10 year olds taking orders and handleing money. Thwy just couldnt be in the cook area around hots and sharps.", "It\u2019s too bad this is a throwaway account", "I don't think it matters honestly. It's a child, not her child, and it didn't work for them. That's more than enough of a reason not to have a child in a commercial kitchen.", "That's exactly the error I had to correct when I was 15. My adult manager (owner, actually) at Baskin-Robbins had decorated a $35 ice cream cake as \"Hapy Brithday Boby.\" The father picking it up was a trifle displeased.\n\nThat was in 1978,  so my Googling just informed me it was the equivalent of a $164 cake today!\n\nI imagine having an 11-year-old in a professional bakery would be like having multiple large house cats perpetually underfoot and in the way. Constantly having to stop moving the hot pans because there's suddenly a HEAD in front of its destination.\n\nYeah, let's just bump up the stress a little.", "Who tf can't spell happy birthday at 11? Have you forgotten what it was like being 11 or what", "I have literally no idea. She would cry if I told her \"no.\" She would cry if I would ask her not to do something.

Did they even try to teach her anything?  Did she cause damage?  Did she not understand instructions?  WHY is the question I want to know.", "How do you even know that OP is in the US?", "Could've, but didn't. And the time has now passed. So all a moot point and not relevent to the question.", "Yikes! Getting to shadow in your bakery is a privilege and her behavior wasn't up to it.", "Yeah this is why I said ESH\u2026 like it sounds like it was obviously very clear from the get go that this was not going to work\u2026 why put up with it all summer? That\u2019s an AH thing to do to your employees, yourself, and to the niece for getting her hopes up.\n\nAlso, why agree to a full summer to begin with? I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that an 11 year old in a bakery is likely to be problematic. Why didn\u2019t OP tell SIL they would \u201ctry one shift\u201d, or something like that? It\u2019s a pretty misleading way to go about this whole thing\u2026 I can definitely see why SIL and niece are now confused and hurt.", "\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "I agree.

She's answered all of those questions already", "lol she doesn\u2019t have time during her work day to mentor an 11 year old\u2026 it\u2019s just not feasible. she owes no explanation in my opinion, but perhaps you\u2019re right", "Not saying 11 is a good age to be working in a bakery, but 50lb sacks were nothing to me at that age and I wouldn't be surprised at an 11 year old being able to haul them around. I raised goats as a kid and we had 40lb bags of feed and I could carry two at a time with a bit of effort. We had 50lb bags too, and I couldn't carry two of those at once but one was easy.", "I think a small bakery might not necessarily have the largest-scale professional equipment on-hand. An 11 year old can definitely prep stuff, measure stuff out, add sprinkles to cupcakes, fold boxes, wrap packages, some general tidying, some dishwashing. Like yeah, she's only 11, but that's also a kid about to go to Jr. High so not exactly an invalid lol. \n\nI don't think OP is an asshole for not wanting the niece to come back, but I almost feel like she just expected an 11 year old to work like a regular adult employee. But again, not enough info.\n\n*I did read OPs comments now. Kid does sound like a nightmare if we are taking everything at face-value. I don't think she's an asshole, but she needs to learn to nip things in the bud and maybe communicate a whole lot better.", "If the other employees weren\u2019t happy with the niece being there that should be enough.   OP wouldn\u2019t want her regular employees to be unhappy.", "I think it matters. Especially if this person is going to Reddit to seek validation for their actions. If they want an opinion, they should give all the context. I have a feeling that they aren\u2019t given examples of the child\u2019s behavior because the child actually behaved well.", "NTA. Curious about what your SIL\u2019s response is to 1) her daughter doing all of that for 2-3 months (I\u2019m assuming her answer was you and your entire staff should just be ok with it because she\u2019s a kid) and 2) how she or her husband would appreciate that at their jobs.", "Maybe it's because you just had her standing there for the whole summer? Bad aunt.", "I don't think it even matters why she doesn't want her back. It's her business, it didn't work out for her, and she needs to look out for herself and her employees. It's hard to find employees that you gel with and that are reliable etc. End of the day, she doesn't want her back. I completely understand. I bake for a living. The amount of people that say they want to help and it turns into me taking too much time out because they are asking a million questions. I just need to work. I am losing money the slower and slower I go. Having someone hanging around when you are working is annoying. Especially when it's a regular thing.", "Since OP isn't responding, I'm guessing the kid was probably just extremely annoying. Which, like, plenty of 11 year olds are extremely annoying, and I can understand if she doesn't want her back for that reason. However, it seems like there are better ways to have handled this rather than waiting till she was gone and then saying \"no I don't want her back\". Accepting an 11 year old as an employee will naturally mean having to mentor them. Kids don't come perfect, they need to be taught. Seems like OP wasn't prepared for that.", "It matters because it\u2019s an argument against allowing the niece to continue coming on Saturdays, which is what this post is about.", "No, I have very little sympathy for both SIL and the niece. OP told SIL about her daughter's behaviour and nothing was done about it, so she was aware of how much of a nuisance her daughter was. There's no reason for her or her daughter to be confused. \n\nOP was being too nice to both of them, she should have kicked the niece out after the first day instead of giving her chance after chance. At 11 years old you know when you're being bratty.", "I think things would have gone better had you given her something to do. Don't you know kids act out when they are bored. She could have done dishes, swept, etc. Doesn't seem like this was ever going to be a good arrangement since nothing was planned for her to do.", ">I initially agreed to the job shadowing because I thought it would just be for a couple hours\n\nSo when SIL kept dropping her off for extended periods of time, why didn't you tell her the girl needed to be picked up in no more then 2 hours or she wasn't allowed back?\n\nListen...  I understand a lot of people don't grow up being taught how to be assertive, but in your case you're taking it to the extreme.  If you can tell her she can't come back now, why couldn't you tell her that then?\n\nAlso - is your niece diagnosed with ADHD?  Obviously I can't diagnose someone from just what you've told us, but everything you've said about it, lack of situational awareness, lower maturity than her age would presume, (her mother being sensitive about \"crushing her spirit\", hints at ADHD.\n\nThen again, you gave her no structure, no instructions except \"stay over there\", and apparently she ate so many bakery items as to affect your bottom line (again, why didn't you just say \"No, you've had enough for today\", did she not bring a lunch with her?) that all of this could just be regular 11yo behavior.\n\nEither way this is one of those classic situations where you're not the AH for what you want, or the boundaries you're setting...  but you shot yourself in the foot by trying to be \"nice\" for so long that you eventually wore out all your patience.\n\nIf you want to salvage this relationship (which you may not want to, reasonably), you can tell your SIL that you will give your niece 1 hour of \"teaching\" time, once a month.  Niece should tell you what idea/technique/concept she wants to learn a week ahead of time, you'll tell her what she needs to bring (like a small cake ready to be frosted, or 8 cupcakes to practice piping on or whatever) and you'll spend an hour teaching her that technique!  \n\nAnd when she's 14yo you can discuss her taking an actual job washing dishes and mopping the floors a few hours a week, if she's still interested.", "I do think that's enough that's why it's weird OP agreed on the first place and focuses on the child being \"terrible\" when I'd think it'd be easy to say \"It was dangerous to have her there\" \"I could t watch her while working and neither couldn't my colleagues\". OP has framed it as the child was a bad employee when in some ways, of course she was, she wouldn't need to be taught and she's 11. Seems easy to say \"SIL it's too dangerous, health code violations, I can't babysit. I can maybe work with niece on a few weekends\"", "Farm kids and suburban kids age different.", "Even if she was well behaved that doesn\u2019t mean having her there wasn\u2019t an issue. We\u2019ve all had that coworker who is incredibly nice but incredibly useless at their job, and it the effects the whole team.\n\nThis is an 11 year old, she\u2019s likely not trained in foodsafe, not mature or responsible enough to be handling cash and if she required any kind of handholding for basic tasks like sweeping or putting stuff away that\u2019s going to slow down productivity and create frustration.\n\nThe niece could have been an absolute angel but if her being there wasn\u2019t helpful, it wasn\u2019t helpful and it clearly impacted the staff that are trained and OP does pay as employees.", "Even if her niece was an angel, an actual bakery isn't a place for an 11 year old. This isn't helping out auntie in her kitchen as a side hustle. She has a legitimate business with four employees (including herself). An 11 year old shouldn't be there at all. The fact that four adults, including her aunt who loves her enough to have said yes to the offer initially even though she didn't want to, had a terrible time is already proof enough she shouldn't be there. A 5th grader has no business in a commercial kitchen. Come on now.", "> the child actually behaved well.\n\nI believe that too, and *it doesn't matter* because she's losing money babysitting when she should be baking. \n\nAn 11-year-old is not capable of doing a good enough job to compensate for the time it takes to have them in the way at a job site.", "There's no reason why the kid should have been coming back. OP just thought she had to get through the summer. What good would it do to tell the SIL how frustrating her child is? She was just trying to get to the end. And then her SIL expected her to offer an ongoing weekend job to her daughter, and perhaps even told the daughter about it (based on the \"breaking a little girl's heart\" chatter).", "She's explained in replies what the kid was doing", "Where did OP say she told SIL about the daughter\u2019s behavior? In the post OP only told the SIL \u201cit wasn\u2019t productive.\u201d\n\nOP definitely should have just ended it rather than focusing on \u201csince I had made the promise\u201d. That would have just led to a different AITA post, but at least her employees would have been happier.", "I have literally no idea. I'm never around kids.", "Honestly I put most of the credit in me just wanting to prove I could carry as many as my older brother. It was less lifestyle and more competitiveness. I was not a particularly ripped child.\n\nBut anyway, I'm just saying that kids are stronger than they look and physical strength is probably the last thing I'd worry about with a child working in a kitchen. I'd be worried about them remembering to follow proper hand-washing protocols, injuries from burns and knives, just general childish carelessness causing accidents (kids don't think to call out \"behind\" or \"corner\"), and the liability of having child labor in my business.", "Did I say she needs to come back? Obviously it's fine if OP doesn't want her back, I'm only commenting on how the situation was handled. If OP had communicated about how the daughter was doing at the job, then everyone would be in mutual understanding. Instead the mom and kid both seem blindsided.", "She said this in a reply.", "Here's a link to the comment that says OP told SIL:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/vzG2YyWMYG\n\nHoping you don't get downvoted just because OP decided to spread across in the comments relevant details that should've been mentioned in the post.", "You don't like your niece we get it.", "I'm not saying you said she needs to come back. But the fact that not accepting a further imposition is seen as blindsiding them is silly, IMO. The mother should have had absolutely zero expectation of this being an ongoing situation! So I think they blindsided OP by coming in with an assumption that she would continue to do a massive favour for them. I think the SIL is the one who handled the situation horrendously.\n\nShe could have told SIL that her child was a PITA, useless and an obstruction to her job. And maybe she should have, for the sake of herself, her staff and her business. But she took on the responsibility she had been asked to take on. Unless she was hoping to get the girl to leave early, there would have been no purpose to telling the mother and creating a rift.", "I really appreciate that you provided a link. \n\nAgreed that they should have been included originally and should be edited in now.
