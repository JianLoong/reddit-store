Your GF's mom clearly doesn't understand So Cal traffic!", "NTA - that's ridiculous. Airlines even tell you to be there 1.5-2 hours before depature. She was being way dramatic.", "NAH\nExplain the math. Some people just dont understand how to be on time.", "I live near sea-tac Airport where you need 4+ hours to be sure you'll make it lol. Nta.", "NTA - boarding starts 40 minutes prior, check bags + security can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour depending on the airport though long beach is definitely on the shorter side and it takes 1.5 to get there so if my math is right that leaves up to 30 minute emergency buffer. While that is more extreme of a buffer than I would leave for myself, I wouldn't find it offensive if my host wanted to do that.", "NTA. Maybe she has no experience with LA area traffic, but I do. Leaving for the airport 3 hours ahead when it takes 1.5 hours to drive there *with no traffic* (hahahaha) is the best idea. They'd be horrified if you planned poorly and caused her to miss her flight. You can always hang out a while near the airport if you arrive early.", "So, you were trying to get her to the airport on time and she took issue with it? Definitely NTA. Next time leave 2 hours before her flight and allow her to miss her flight\u2026but make her stay at the airport and deal with it on her own.", "NTA, she can get an Uber next time.  It\u2019s not worth a 3 hour round trip drive for you to take someone to the airport.  Especially when they are unreasonable and rude.", "NTA- All you did was plan ahead and take into account travel time versus traffic.. you actually did her solid but she doesn\u2019t live there so she probably didn\u2019t understand how bad traffic can be there.. next time just let her pick the time and be late then she will understand", "NTA, it was thoughtful of you to think ahead time-wise, and super generous of you to do the round trip drive to take her there yourself.", "NAH, it sounds like she just doesn\u2019t know where Long Beach is.", "NTA, she\u2019s going to learn the hard way about traffic, timing and airports.  She obviously doesn\u2019t get it.  Sorry.", "Sometimes it's not what you say but how you say it. NAH", "NTA on a good day driving in LA it can take half an hour to go a few miles.", "NTA, Tell your girlfriend to drive her to the airport.", "NTA. She needs to understand that traffic is horrible in LA", "NTA. Maybe she didn\u2019t realize the airport was so far away?  Don\u2019t know, but arriving at the airport 1.5 hrs before her flight seems pretty normal to me.", "NTA, let her leave late and miss her flight.

Only way her comment makes sense.", "NTA! \n\nMaybe she doesn\u2019t understand how far it is and you always need extra time (especially when covering this much distance) to allow for any traffic issues.", "NTA traffic over there can be crazy so obviously if it\u2019s 1.5 hours out with no traffic + going through security at the airport you would want to give yourself enough time to not be rushing", "Uhhh NTA, I live 30 min from the airport and head there 3 hours before my flight \ud83d\ude05", "NTA-as someone who travels a lot it\u2019s understandable to leave early especially if its an international flight and in Cali the traffic is bad I think your gf\u2019s mom comment was unnecessary", "Get her an Uber for whatever time *she* thinks she should leave, then grab some popcorn.", "NTA.", "NTA. She can always take a cab or uber if she wants", "NTA, traffic is a massive variable and if you have to kill time airports are generally well equipped places if you did end up early", "NTA. Long Beach basically has no lines which is the only reason 3 hours is enough. If she was going to LAX I\u2019d add on another two hours lol", "NTA You're supposed to be at the airport 2 hours before a domestic flight. If you left 3 hours before and subtract the drive time she would arrive at the airport a half hour later than she should. She was totally overreacting.\n\nTraffic is bad there and you also could have easily been delayed by that. She should be thankful that you trying to get her there with time to spare so that she didn't have to rush through the airport. It's always better to get past security with plenty of time to spare and chill at the gate.", "Wait, I lived in the SF valley. In what realm are you that there are 5 other airports within 15-30 minutes of you with LA traffic? I couldn\u2019t make it to Beverly Hills at 6am within 30 minutes. Driving back at 2am was a god damn nightmare.", "That drive can take 3 hours if traffic goes to shit. NTA at all.", "Nta - Frankly, 3 hours before departure was cutting it rather close, traffic being what it is. And why Long Beach? If the motive was to avoid LAX (valid), Burbank is much more convenient.", "NTA... she wants to miss her flight ... \n\n\"Start the car!!!\"", "omg this is so true... my girlfriend has this handicap.", "If LA traffic takes 1.5 hours without traffic, drive time is gonna be at least 2 hours, more like 2.5 for any time an airplane is scheduled to leave.", "She was actually aware of how far it was, but she had definitely underestimated how bad LA traffic can be. I even leave that early when it\u2019s LAX or Burbank", "NTA \n\nFirst there is the possibility of traffic. Then when my sister was flying out the airport told us to be there a minimum of 2 hours early for security checks or they might not let her on her flight.", "3 hours from San Fernando Valley to Long Beach to make a flight, totally reasonable.\nNTA", "I aim to be at the airport 2h before departure time. I once left 6h early for a 2h drive, and I spent every single fucking minute of wriggle space stuck in a standstill on the M25, and made it with minutes to spare. \n\nI\u2019d leave earlier than OP. \n\n(I\u2019ve also missed a flight, which was not fun.)", "You know OP would be getting blamed for the missed flight, right? It's always the driver's fault, no matter how late the passenger decides to leave.", "That's when I'd reimburse her for a lyft. She is in charge of arranging her ride and OP doesn't have to sit in 4 to 5 hours of traffic. I live in the Valley and it's a loooooong drive to Long Beach.", "Yes, but at least OP will be able to enjoy some malicious compliance/petty revenge.", "I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm ALWAYS early, so this is an easy NTA for me. But since the airlines ask you to be there at least an hour before your flight, you weren't even going that much earlier than you needed to, so NTA in any way.", "NTA. Also fuck that. She's saving money for herself on the flight by donating a minimum of 3 hours of your time and gas money.\n\nThat's some bullshit. She didn't even ask ahead of time like hey is a 1.5hr trip out to there okay, has she done so you could say okay but we'd need to leave at least 3 hours early to get there in LA traffic. Or you could have said err, that's a very long drive, how about you uber that or just go to a closer airport.\n\nShe probably saved under $100 by spending ops time instead.", "NTA because traffic anywhere in the world is unpredictable! But I\u2019d like to know what time you actually did leave at, and whether or not you arrived on time \ud83d\ude42", "NTA  \n\n\nBut I'm guessing she didn't do the math at all. 3 hours early seems late if it's 1.5 hours with no traffic.  That can jump to an easy 2.5 hours in a hurry-which leave half an hour to clear security and board.   \nPlus if the ticket shows flight time, the doors close before that, so that's 15 minutes.   \n\n\nJust the thought gives travel anxiety. Unless the airline will book you on the next flight for free (rarer and rarer these days), that's just too close.   \n\n\nLeaving 4 hours in advance seems safer. Hell, if it's a small airport, park and have a coffee/lunch together in the airport before security.", "NTA - tell her to get a taxi then.", "Tell her to make her own way there.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Yeah. When you take someone to an airport and they miss their flight, you always end up being on-call to usher them around. At least that\u2019s my experience.  It\u2019s frustrating.", "I feel like this almost negates the purpose of flying...to save time.", "NTA. \nI have taken 4 hours to reach the airport on time, so definitely relatable. Why\u2019d she act this way tho? Do you have a rocky relationship with your gf\u2019s mom?", "That time frame gives her zero wiggle room (assuming traffic and security are both running smoothly) idk why they\u2019d assume the worst of you, but just explain the math, and that even with perfect conditions between LA traffic and airport security.. reality is you should have left 4-5 hours before boarding time (not departure time). But I come from a German family that\u2019s paranoid about missing flights and such. But hey, we\u2019ve never missed a flight!", "NTA - if this woman can book the flight herself she can organise transport herself and deal with the drama if she misses her flight because of traffic", "NTA - Im awful for being late to places or thinking I have way more time than i actually do (thanks ADHD) and I would still be AT the airport 3 hrs earlier than my departure time, never mind setting off from the house 3 hrs early. especially with airport security and such. NTA", "NTA . Next time just wait on her and then drive slowwwly.", "NTA\n\nLeaving home 3 hours ahead of the flight when there is a 1.5 hour drive (hmmm did the money she saved on the flight by any chance help towards fuel for the 3 hour trip to drop her off for it - thought not!) means *without traffic* she would arrive 1.5 hours before the plane takes off.  Allowing for a speedy check in etc she would have maybe an hour to wait, so time for a coffee without rushing.   How long before a flight do you have to check in?  Guessing it is not just 5 minutes.  Throw in traffic hold ups, diversions, queues at the airport that would soon be eaten into. \n\nWhen did they want to leave - 1.5 hours before the plane was due to take off?", "Women and logic dont coexist in the same place. That was your first failure to understand. Just treat all of them as different levels of crazy and you might stand a chance.", "I fly out of Newark airport all the time it's about 1 1/2 hr drive, then security could take an hour or so, walking to the gate, stopping to get a snack with a line.. I easily leave about 4  hrs early...  Better safe than sorry.", "NTA. You\u2019re being considerate in making sure she\u2019s in plenty of time for her flight and not putting yourself under pressure should there be traffic problems/RTA to slow you down", "NTA drop her to the bus station next time", "Nta.  This is how you handle it.  \nLeave when she wants.  And when she\u2019s running or misses her flight. It will be obvious you were right.  You win and she looks like a idiot", "So what time did you leave and what time did you arrive at the airport? We need the \u201cI told you so\u201d follow up.", "Traffic plus any potential problems you may run into at the airport.", "This!! Traffic is so unpredictable... NM the chronic construction. I don't even live in Cali and know this from traveling there and being stuck in absurd traffic situations that made us way late to things", "As long as the drive is more than 4 hours that's true no? Or maybe they don't want to drive.", "I possess this problem as well, it's irritating.", "She's complaining about getting \"thrown out\" half an hour early. Tossing her into Lyft would have gone awesome"]}
