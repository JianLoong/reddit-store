However, I\u2019ll say that with the assumption that the household does not need $6k. \n\nI get that they were a gift. You should go have a good time. If there was a household situation where the $6k could be better used\u2026.like to pay off credit card debt, repair a car problem, etc. \n\nI\u2019m a practical person, so as long as the $6k isn\u2019t needed by the household for the good of the family, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about going to the concert.", "NTA it\u2019s illegal to resale tickets.

We went on family holidays for 1500 and would usually be on holidays for two weeks. You can literally have 8 weeks of holidays or one night concert (probably 2 hours tops) to an artist you have already seen and will be able to see for atleast another 10 years.\n\nIm doubting the succesful business part if your husband wants cash out.\n\nBut its your present so I understand you aswell. I just know I would never ever go to this concert for this amount of money unless we had 10mil in the bank lol. 6000 for 1 night of maybe 2 hours is just ridiculous. Maybe if you were dying and never saw her in your life id understand.", "NAH\n\nI think a lot depends on your personal finances.\n\nIf you have a relatively high income; no credit card debt; a very reliable car etc.  so that $6000 is not a huge amount in terms of your income versus your expenses, then enjoy it.\n\nI am not sure that this is a black or white question. There might be things that OP would enjoy equally as the concert or there could be a splurge on something else that didn't cost as much. I didn't get the sense that the husband wanted the money to be spent on something that would be only for husband's benefit. \n\nIs there truly nothing else that $6000 would be better used for - most people could fund a really nice vacation for that amount.\n\nI understand why you want to go - on the other hand I understand why someone would think there are better ways a family could use $6000 - both practical and fun.\n\nOn the other hand, it is technically your money - to spend how you want.
