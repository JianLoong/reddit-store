T-Swift tix or otherwise, I\u2019d be mad if my husband (if I had one) wanted me to get onboard with selling my birthday present to make some fast cash. \n\nPlus, if money isn\u2019t a problem, he\u2019s just being greedy. \n\nHowever, you also might want to point out to him that just because people are *asking* that much for them, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re actually *selling* at that price.", "The tickets were a gift to you, and therefore yours.   Your husband has no grounds - financial or otherwise - to demand you sell them.     \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Concerts are not business opportunities. Thank you for not being a scalper. Have a wonderful birthday show!", "He be a huge jerk a present is a present", "I get his POV as I had tickets for the first performance of Hamilton post-racking up so many Tony Awards, and wow, could I have made bank! But I took my 16yo son and we had the most joyous trip. Go see TS!", "NTA concerts are experiences you can\u2019t relive, he\u2019s be fine without his 6k profit. Ridiculous he\u2019d even ask.", "NTA .\nPretty crass of him to even suggest that you sell your tickets and skip a show you're excited about, especially when the tickets are your birthday gift.", "NTA - Go take one of your friends and leave him at home with the toddlers since he is acting like one.", "NTA\n\nHe gifted the tickets to you, you can do what you want with them. If you sold them the 6k would be yours to do what you want with.", "So\u2026 he buys you the tickets and now wants to sell them for a profit but at your personal cost? Wow what a dick\n\nNTA, how dare you want to go the concert!", "why are you even asking? theyre tickets for YOU", "NTA. Its your gift, it's wrong and greedy for him to sell it.

However, I\u2019ll say that with the assumption that the household does not need $6k. \n\nI get that they were a gift. You should go have a good time. If there was a household situation where the $6k could be better used\u2026.like to pay off credit card debt, repair a car problem, etc. \n\nI\u2019m a practical person, so as long as the $6k isn\u2019t needed by the household for the good of the family, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about going to the concert.", "NTA it\u2019s illegal to resale tickets.
