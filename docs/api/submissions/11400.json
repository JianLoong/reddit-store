They were supposed to leave this afternoon but unfortunately, 2 people tested positive this morning and the 3rd was exposed so the trip has been cancelled.\n\nI have not been able to take any type of vacation in over a year and it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019ll be an option anytime soon so when my husband told me about the trip, I thought it would be an excellent time to also take Friday/Monday off and have a staycation for myself. I went on a mini shopping spree at Lush, bought special groceries for myself, planned a hike and a girls craft night/cocktail party and found my favorite old movies for a movie night. Ryan and I like a lot of the same things but I wanted to take this opportunity to do and cook all the things that I like but he doesn\u2019t. \n\nRyan suggested that since he now has the weekend free, I could rearrange mine and we could have extra time together. I love my husband and will absolutely make time to spend with him but I still want to keep all of my plans. \n\nHe\u2019s upset because he feels I\u2019m being selfish, especially on the food aspect. I do all of the cooking and cleaning and the way we share our finances reflects that (80/20) so he feels like me cooking things for only myself for 4 days is breaking our agreement and unfair to him. He also doesn\u2019t want my friends drinking here because I told them that they could stay the night and we\u2019d have brunch in the morning. he wants me to cancel the cocktail part of the evening and only have the craft night because it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d for an adult to have a sleepover party when their spouse is home and the potential for us to be loud and obnoxious is inconsiderate to him.\n\nI\u2019m prepping eggplant parm and arugula salad right now for my dinner tonight (he despises both eggplant and arugula) and I suggested he take himself out for dinner as a treat and he got really annoyed with me and left the house. I don\u2019t know if I should feel bad or not. I think he\u2019s expecting too much from me to always be on.", "created_utc": 1677876006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11he860/aita_for_not_cancelling_my_own_plans_when_my/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But wait!  Since you don't contribute enough cash, it should be YOU cooking.  Aw, how cute.  He's an asshole. \n\nNTA.", "**NTA** OP, I'm sorry, I missed the part of the post where *your* plans got cancelled because your friends had the 'Rona. \n\nIt sucks that your husbands plans got cancelled, but why would you reneg on *your* plans and agreements with *your* friends to do these things? \n\nHim being inconvenienced does not mean you and other people have to be inconvenienced.", "NTA. I agree, he should take himself out to dinner. Your weekend sounds like a lot of fun!", "NTA. I hope this is an unusual toddler tantrum from your husband and not the norm. Have fun eating, drinkig, and crafting!", "NTA. Would he have cancelled plans if it was the other way round? He\u2019s being ridiculous, doesn\u2019t want your friends drinking a sleepover party is inappropriate?! The more I read the more stupid this sounds, enjoy your night with the girls.", "NTA, he is the one beiy selfish here. He needs to make other plans and let you proceed with yours. It's unfortunate his trip got cancyely, but you shouldn't suffer aftermath as well", "NTA- I think he\u2019s just upset his plans fell through and is taking it out on you- misery loves company. You made a good suggestion for him to take himself out as a treat. You need your time with the girls.", "NTA he is jealous his sleepover got cancelled and yours didn't and totally going to spoil the mood so you need to find someone who isn't sick to hang out with him and send him out.", "NTA. He's being completely unreasonable about the food. That said, it might be worth seeing if someone else can host the overnight so he doesn't act like a sully jerk the whole time.", "NTA you were supposed to stay in stasis and not have a life outside of him when he was away obviously./s\n\nHe\u2019s going to ruin your girls night be being sulky and complain about the noise and be disruptive.  You know that right?", "NTA. Not your fault your husband\u2019s plans fell through. I think he\u2019s being a big baby.", "Hope you enjoy your weekend!!! Drink brunch do it allll you\u2019re not the a hole", "NTA So because his plan got ruined, you should drop everything you had planned and cater him?! Just nope! Why can he have time for himself (that just doesn't work out) but when you want the same, he gets huffy and puffy? And you can't eat something that he doesn't like - when he shouldn't even be there?! And YOU should be selfish? WTF?!", "NTA. If you're feeling particularly arsey and want to provoke a fight, the following may help.\n\n\"So, if I hadn't found any eggplant and cancelled my weekend as a consequence, would you have cancelled yours too and come home to have a romantic weekend with me instead? You sound very self-centred, and it's very telling that you see me as a servant who now needs to cancel her days off because the master is back in residence.\"", "NTA.   \nWould he have cancelled his plans if roles were reversed? While it\u2019s unfortunate his plans were canceled, he knew the two of you were doing seperate things this weekend.\n\nEnjoy your weekend.", "NTA. You have plans. I keep seeing this on this sub- people make plans and expect their partner to just drop everything when their plans fall through. That\u2019s so insane to me. You made PLANS. If he doesn\u2019t want to be around when your friends are there, he can leave.  It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that his plans fell through, but his misfortune doesn\u2019t need to be yours because he\u2019s sad. He needs to grow up and figure out how to survive on his own for a weekend.", "NTA\n\nJust because he contributes more financially doesn't mean you're 'not allowed' a break from cooking and cleaning - you're his wife, not his housekeeper.\n\nDo you ever get a day off cooking other than when he's away?\n\nYou're supposed to he a partnership, which means he should respect your plans even though his fell through, and he can fend for himself for a day or two.", "NTA his weekend got ruined, yours doesn't need to.  It doesn't sound like you get much down time (why do you do ALL the cooking and cleaning???) and you planned this out, you should get to do it.  He can go find something else to do for the evening.  My friends' husbands always make themselves scarce when we're at their houses.", "NTA - Ryan is being spoiled and selfish.  The fact that he didn't encourage you to keep your plans and didn't offer to vacate the house while your friends are there is disappointing.  He seems super entitled - and I'm sorry he's unable to put your first this one time.  His childish temper tantrum at the end is also quite emotionally manipulative.  If he's unable to put your wants and plans first THIS ONCE you've got a spouse issue that you need to seriously address.", " NTA. If your plans had been can\u2019t, would he have not left and stayed home with you?  There\u2019s your answer.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry his plans fell through last minute. Big bummer. But this was a planned weekend apart, and your plans haven\u2019t fallen apart. He needs to respect that.", "NTA.  Not your fault his plans fell through.  He\u2019s old enough that he ought to be able to figure out how to feed himself and find something else to do.  If your plans had fallen through, would he have cancelled his trip?  Don\u2019t think so.", "NTA\n\nYour weekend sounds fun! Enjoy it and don\u2019t let him ruin it because his own plans got ruined", "NTA. I don't see why the fact that you earn less means that you should do all the cooking and cleaning, unless he works a lot more hours than you do. But it's unfair that he's pressuring you to give up all your plans; it isn't even just one of the things that you want to do because he wants you to give up EVERYTHING you want to do. And that's selfish.", "you man is insecure and controlling.... wtf", "NTA, Ryan is bang out of order, mate.", "NTA. Why would you change your plans when someone else's plan is canceled? Just go and enjoy and let him dwell in his own sorrow.", "NTA.\n\nHe needs to make some different plans for himself.", "NTA.  His plans were ruined but yours were not.  The only thing you may want to change is having your friends at the house because it sounds like your hubby will be a killjoy and downer moping about making everyone uncomfortable, lol.", "NTA. Not your fault his plans fell through. That being said, if I were in your shoes, I\u2019d try to be a bit flexible just because I would understand his disappointment. If possible, I would move the \u201cgirls night\u201d to someone else\u2019s place and maybe compromise on the meals with either 1 meal together or 1 meal for only me each of the days. That being said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to do any of that, and if you keep your plans exactly as before, still NTA.", "NTA. Does he always behave like a child when he doesn\u2019t get things his own way?", "Keep,the girls night.  If he insists on crafts, tell him ok - then to craft cocktails (that was how I read your plans anyway and it sounded like so much fun.\n\nNTA.  He has an opportunity to go do things with friends that are not sick, but the food you bought would get wasted if you don\u2019t get to cook/eat it.", "NTA! Your husband is acting like a self centered asshat. He\u2019s selfish, juvenile, and inconsiderate. This can\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s shown his colors. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should cancel but his angry presence in the home may cause trouble with your friends or make them uncomfortable. It is kind of sad that you haven\u2019t had a vacay and had to wait til he went out of town to plan something. \n\nBtw, you should be able to eat foods he doesn\u2019t like anytime you want. There\u2019s a lot of unnecessary drama going on with your hubby and your relationship. Good luck", "NTA. Your husband is a d**k.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is there any risk that he\u2019s also been exposed since all of his friends are sick/exposed?
