They were supposed to leave this afternoon but unfortunately, 2 people tested positive this morning and the 3rd was exposed so the trip has been cancelled.\n\nI have not been able to take any type of vacation in over a year and it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019ll be an option anytime soon so when my husband told me about the trip, I thought it would be an excellent time to also take Friday/Monday off and have a staycation for myself. I went on a mini shopping spree at Lush, bought special groceries for myself, planned a hike and a girls craft night/cocktail party and found my favorite old movies for a movie night. Ryan and I like a lot of the same things but I wanted to take this opportunity to do and cook all the things that I like but he doesn\u2019t. \n\nRyan suggested that since he now has the weekend free, I could rearrange mine and we could have extra time together. I love my husband and will absolutely make time to spend with him but I still want to keep all of my plans. \n\nHe\u2019s upset because he feels I\u2019m being selfish, especially on the food aspect. I do all of the cooking and cleaning and the way we share our finances reflects that (80/20) so he feels like me cooking things for only myself for 4 days is breaking our agreement and unfair to him. He also doesn\u2019t want my friends drinking here because I told them that they could stay the night and we\u2019d have brunch in the morning. he wants me to cancel the cocktail part of the evening and only have the craft night because it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d for an adult to have a sleepover party when their spouse is home and the potential for us to be loud and obnoxious is inconsiderate to him.\n\nI\u2019m prepping eggplant parm and arugula salad right now for my dinner tonight (he despises both eggplant and arugula) and I suggested he take himself out for dinner as a treat and he got really annoyed with me and left the house. I don\u2019t know if I should feel bad or not. I think he\u2019s expecting too much from me to always be on.", "created_utc": 1677876006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11he860/aita_for_not_cancelling_my_own_plans_when_my/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that his plans fell through, but his misfortune doesn\u2019t need to be yours because he\u2019s sad.
