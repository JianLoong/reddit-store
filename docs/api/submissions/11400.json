They were supposed to leave this afternoon but unfortunately, 2 people tested positive this morning and the 3rd was exposed so the trip has been cancelled.\n\nI have not been able to take any type of vacation in over a year and it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019ll be an option anytime soon so when my husband told me about the trip, I thought it would be an excellent time to also take Friday/Monday off and have a staycation for myself. I went on a mini shopping spree at Lush, bought special groceries for myself, planned a hike and a girls craft night/cocktail party and found my favorite old movies for a movie night. Ryan and I like a lot of the same things but I wanted to take this opportunity to do and cook all the things that I like but he doesn\u2019t. \n\nRyan suggested that since he now has the weekend free, I could rearrange mine and we could have extra time together. I love my husband and will absolutely make time to spend with him but I still want to keep all of my plans. \n\nHe\u2019s upset because he feels I\u2019m being selfish, especially on the food aspect. I do all of the cooking and cleaning and the way we share our finances reflects that (80/20) so he feels like me cooking things for only myself for 4 days is breaking our agreement and unfair to him. He also doesn\u2019t want my friends drinking here because I told them that they could stay the night and we\u2019d have brunch in the morning. he wants me to cancel the cocktail part of the evening and only have the craft night because it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d for an adult to have a sleepover party when their spouse is home and the potential for us to be loud and obnoxious is inconsiderate to him.\n\nI\u2019m prepping eggplant parm and arugula salad right now for my dinner tonight (he despises both eggplant and arugula) and I suggested he take himself out for dinner as a treat and he got really annoyed with me and left the house. I don\u2019t know if I should feel bad or not.

But he is taking it out on you by trying to ruin yours! What a selfish AH. He is being entitled and childish. Not to mention controlling and manipulative! \n\nYou have to change/cancel all your plans for him, cook him what he wants, cater to him? \nHe doesn't get to order you around and dictate what you do or how you interact with your friends. \n\nIt's inappropriate for a group of gown women to sleep in the same house after drinking? \nHim condescendingly classifying it as such is an attempt to infantalize you and invalidate your feelings. \n\nAnd he had the nerve to call you selfish and inconsiderate?\nWow. I'm guessing he doesn't really consider your wants, needs, or feelings very often, and he's especially not considering them right now. \n\nThere are a lot of things you've said here that are kind of concerning. The fact that you feel like you can only do these things you enjoy when he's not around. The fact that you feel like you need to \"always be on\" around him. It's all about what he wants and what is most convenient for him. Someone who truly loves and respects you would want you to have/do the things you like. They would want to give you the space to do the things that make you happy, at the very least. Ideally, they would want to share in those things and experience that happiness with you, if only to see you happy. \n\nI'm not going to jump right to \"dump him\", but you should take some time to really examine the things about this relationship that might need fixing. Think about how often you prioritize him vs. how often he prioritizes you. Think about how often you each compromise and how much emotional labour you each carry. Think about what you need out of this relationship, and tell him. Set firm boundaries, and set aside space and time for you to take care of yourself. You need that. Consider couples counselling to help navigate those changes if needed.\n\nAlso, I really don't think you're going to get to enjoy your staycation with him at home. Unless he has a change of heart rather quickly, he's going to spend the weekend sulking and whining and ruining your plans and happiness.
