Couldn't begin to recall how many times I've gotten some form of \"I fucking hate you! I want a divorce!\" ....and that's on the *mild* end of the spectrum.\n\nGood on you for doing it.

Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nYou can\u2019t just talk about divorce to your SO and then be all shocked Pikachu face when it happens.\n\nNTA", "NTA You can only take so much abuse.", "NTA  \nArmchair analyst perspective:  \n\nIf she says she wants a divorce but also says she doesn't; then it's about something else - and in this case it sounds like she is looking for help with her own issues.  \n\nQuestion is:  What do you want?  If you want to remain together, than some 3rd-pary intervention (counseling/medication) is likely the next step.  If you don't want to remain together for whatever reason, then you shouldn't.\n\nBased on this very limited amount of information; it seems that you both want to be together but don't know how to make that happen.  If this is the case, don't try to solve it between yourselves.  If you are not in a place where you are wanting/willing to make the effort to identify and fix the issues at hand, you should not feel guilty about going your separate ways.\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. You're married to a depressive alcoholic that isn't happy and you're not happy either. She's not doing anything to change and it's been nine years. You gave her enough of your life. You wouldn't be the asshole to leave her even if she hadn't brought up divorce. It's your house, I don't see any issues with telling her that she needs to vacate, especially since you gave her a reasonable amount of time to do it. You lit yourself on fire to keep someone else warm, and they kept complaining it was still too cold. Time to put the fire out and leave.", "NTA. Let her go. Also, you should consider if she has Borderline Personality Disorder.", "She needs to want to get better for things to change.

Pushing a partner away and then demanding that they continue to demonstrate their love under horrible circumstances is quite typical BPD behaviour.\n\nI would give her the ultimatum that the only way you'll stay with her is if she agrees to go to counseling. And not just marriage counseling, but a licensed psychologist.\n\nI don't think you're an a**hole for taking her seriously. I actually think it's an act of love. You are showing her that she cannot continue to manipulate you like this anymore. You are treating her issues seriously and taking action. But true love will also give her another chance if she's willing to actually work on getting better.", "NTA, only so many times you can have the same thing happen with no changes. You\u2019ve tried to arrange therapy, she\u2019s not willing to change.", "ESH- Maybe some details are left out, but it seems that there is a communication issue and/or lack of boundary setting here. Having to manage someone else's emotions and behavior is a huge energy suck and what she's doing is not OK.  Based on her age, parimenopause could also be a factor.  \n\nDid you set a boundary at some point?  e.g. \"I feel emotionally drained when you talk about divorce and project your issues onto me. In order for me to feel safe, I need you stop projecting and to learn about yourself and your needs through counselling or other means of self discovery or we'll have to separate\". She probably thinks that you blind sided her because you've always talked her down.", "Edit: updated to NAH after some clarification from OP.\n\nESH - I highly doubt you are confused, and you know exactly what you are doing. Why not talk to her about getting help or explain you can't continue the relationship like this? This calling out the bluff will only work if you actually do leave her.

Would you want to remain married if she didn't project on to you in this way? Because that is something that could be addressed in therapy. The fact that you don't appear to have tried that kind of sucks.

If she isn\u2019t making an effort to manage her disease, then you need to leave. \n\nI have treatment resistant depression. 4 decades with it now. Her behavior is a symptom of the disease. She\u2019s self-sabotaging her relationship, probably the sole relationship that\u2019s acting as a support right now. We do that a lot. She likely isn\u2019t doing it with clear cognitive function. Her mind is probably not allowing her to be happy, because her mind is likely saying, \u201cIf you embrace this, if you let yourself be immersed in happiness with him, the moment you do, the universe will take it all away. Better to stay in this mindset. That way, you\u2019ll be ready when life gets shittier than it already is.\u201d She sounds lost in the mental maze of the disease. And it is very much like that - a maze. :( \n\nHowever, it\u2019s not your job to make her well. It\u2019s hers. The thing I\u2019ve learned with this disease is that the only person who can really battle this war is yourself because the battlefield is your own mind. And she isn\u2019t fighting. She isn\u2019t doing her homework. You have tried to get her to fight, and this is all you can do because you can\u2019t experience her mind. \n\nThis shit is like type 1 diabetes. It\u2019s with you for life, so you can\u2019t skip your insulin and expect to not get sick. You need to be vigilant as fuck, yet she\u2019s doing things she knows will make her sicker, especially abusing substances. On top of this, she\u2019s wielding the disease like a weapon, and this is never okay. It\u2019s like her depression has become overwhelming, and she\u2019s trying to transfer some of it to you. If she were serious about fighting this, she\u2019d be in therapy, you would have had sessions with that therapist too, and you two would have ground rules around what\u2019s acceptable and healthy support and what isn\u2019t. \n\nI think you can keep doing this with her and grow resentful and miserable when nothing changes, wondering where your life went, or you can move on and start nursing your own well being back to health. You can\u2019t help a person like this. She has to want to help herself. You spent 9 years trying. That\u2019s more than enough. You are not a bad person. She isn\u2019t either. The disease is just a bitch. Maybe you leaving is exactly the catalyst she needs to get well.", "Alright then NTA. I apologize, I tend to be skeptical of people who post relationship problems on AITA.", "She's depressed and needs professional help. Have you talked to her about getting help?", "I am a she sorry", "See the replies, I've changed my verdict.\n\nAnd the reason for my initial verdict is OP knows she is very depressed.

Let's do it!\" When they know she is saying it out of depression is what would make him an AH.
