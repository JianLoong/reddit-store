I might even spend a night or two with a friend or at a hotel to enforce strong boundaries.  I would simply not do it.\n\nCare-giving is extremely exhausting and extremely expensive.  Caregivers often are blackmailed/emotionally 'guilt-tripped' into doing this work for free (both monetarily and emotionally).   Women are frequently volunteered by husbands and other family members to do care-giving.  These ideas are old-fashioned and outdated and simply need to die.   Don't fall for it!  \n\nCreate strong boundaries for protecting your health (both mental and physical).    Don't allow your husband or anyone else to guilt-trip you into any care-taking that you do not want to do.\n\nI want to say that your MIL might be a very kind, loving person---and most deserving of all the care one can give her.

Stand your ground.  Enforce your boundaries with ACTIONS, not just endless conversations (see above about spending a few nights away from home).  \n\nWishing you all the best.

You shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice your mental and physical well being or your career/income for his mum especially when he\u2019s not willing to do the work himself and is asking so he can go back to work. Him being resistant to pay to get carers to help his mum or out her in a care facility that can accommodate her needs and have the appropriate equipment needed to clean/move her with putting a strain/damaging your body doesn\u2019t negate the fact that it has to be done or he has to leave work to care for her himself.

Siblings? Aunts? Even if it was keeping her company or bringing her a meal. \n\nCarers do often burn out because the responsibility is so huge and the level of work is unexpected. It is too much for one person alone. When my grandmother was ill, she lived with my Dad, my siblings all helped out doing different things on different days. My Dads siblings and their children helped out too and we still had to get outside help so she could have the best care possible and we didn\u2019t get burnt out.

We couldn't take care of him at home, and if I had tried it would have caused great sacrifice to my health.

Wearing yourself to the bone does not help anyone long term. He needs to hire someone or keep doing this himself.", "You may need to have the big sit-down conversation again, now that things have changed. Making it formal can take some of the tension out, and it gives you both a chance to organize your thoughts before you hash it out. \n\nIt's okay to find that caretaking is more than you can handle! It's exhausting, constant work. And you've expressed this to your husband but he's not being responsive, so maybe he's trying to coast and needs something bigger to catch his eye here.", "You need to reach out to someone. Whether that be a therapist, a friend, or a member of your family or his, you need support for yourself. You are actively burning out and this is not going to get better by him ignoring it. Does he not have any other family that can come by and help if he doesn't want to hire someone? Or hire a cleaning service so at least that is dealt with? He needs to help remove something from your plate before the whole plate breaks. \n\nYou are not the a\\*\\*hole for needing help/not being able to handle so much. Caring for someone like that IS a full-time job, hence why we have home nurses and hospice care. You are essentially working two jobs AND managing the household work. That's going to take a toll on anyone, and if husband can't see that, I would make him switch for a few weeks. Have him do all of what you're doing and see how quickly he changes his tune.\n\nAnd just so you know, if he continues to refuse to budge on his stance, you are not the a\\*\\*hole for walking away. You can only do so much, and he is ignoring that. If you need to protect yourself by walking away, that's okay", ">accused me of not caring enough for his MIL\n\n\n\nBut he doesn't care enough for his own Mom! That's worse!! \n\n\nWHY are you the one to essentially work 2 full time jobs? One as your job and the other as her full time caregiver? He should be the one to come home during the day and tend to his Mother. Maybe if he did it for a few weeks he'd see how much of a strain it puts on a person, and hire a professional.  You are NTA.", "I love my grandmother. My whole family does.\n\nAnd you want to know what makes it easier to love her every day. Her having full-time aides.\n\nWe don't have to be the people helping her shower and eat and taking care of her. Instead we can be the people who pop in, check the she's okay, update her on what's going on in our lives. Basically, we can continue- for the most part- the relationships with her that we've always had.\n\nIf your husband wants to be the full-time 24/7 aide. That's his choice. But it's HIS choice. Not yours.\n\nAnd he needs to the one to talk with his siblings about who is going to provide coverage so he can have breaks. So he can get out of the house. So the two of you can have time as a couple.\n\nYou get to say this doesn't work for me. And it's also okay to say that you love him and his mother but that you aren't sure if this will work for your relationship long-term.\n\nAnd that's okay.", "He's only considering his inheritance & doesn't want to fritter it away on paid nurses when he can just dump it all on OP"]}
