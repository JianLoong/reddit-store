After a bunch of agents told me they love it but don't know how to sell it, I got frustrated and decided to self-publish instead. Right now, it's just a manuscript on my computer while I sort out my cover and other stuff that is part of the process.\n\nBackground bit 2- My mom is dying of cancer. Based off how fast she's deteriorating, she will pass in the next few weeks. Everything sucks. Dad died when we were kids.\n\nAfter mom's diagnosis, I moved in to help. My brother (M40) has been pitching in sporadically, but he has a couple of kids, so most of it is on me.\n\nI was sitting on the back porch yesterday having a break from it all when my brother came out. It started as a nice chat but then moved on to the topic of wills, because mom has been getting her papers in order over the last few days after the doctors told her the fight was over. It's has been a bit of a touchy subject because mom wanted to leave me more, because my brother won the lottery about 20 years ago. Not the insane jackpots we see these days, but it would have been enough for him and any family he had to be comfortable forever, if he was careful. But he wasn't careful, and as far as I know is still fairly well off, but is being *much* more careful these days. He doesn't have a regular job, mostly just sits in front of his computer and plays with stocks. I've been battling mental health issues my whole life, and have only ever worked minimum wage because I live very simply and it allows me enough time to pursue my hobbies, which is pretty much all I want to do.\n\nHe asked whether his kids were in my will (I'm childfree and single). I said yes, but my friends were in there too, and he asked what I was leaving to my friends. I mentioned that I was leaving the rights to my (unpublished) book to a good friend, without whom I would never have finished. My brother took offence to that, and said I should leave everything to his kids. To keep it in the family.\n\nI kind of played it down, and right now have no intention of changing anything about my will. My friend told me I could do whatever I wanted with the rights, but he was the one that let me endlessly bounce ideas off him, or read parts I was unsure about. Besides all of this, with the sheer amount of content published these days, the book is more likely to be drowned and never make more than a few thousand dollars.  But on the off-chance it does well, I feel like my friend deserves to be acknowledged because they were my rock for that part of my life, and the book wouldn't exist without them. But when my brother points out that once mom dies, he and the kids are the only blood family I have left, I just feel so damn guilty for not doing as my brother asks.

My brother just kept going on about how family is more important, where was I planning to go for Christmas after Mom dies, yadda yadda.
