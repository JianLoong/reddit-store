So after the post I took the suggestion of a few people and had here do the whole process to get an appeal from the school. So she did the paperwork and prepared to plead her case to the heads of the program.\r  \n\r  \nShe did pretty well and wrote a pretty good essay on why she wanted to appeal and why she believes she should be in the program. She also did well when she was pleading her case to the heads of the program which was a science teacher. She is a strict women and I didn't expect much when it happened, and my daughters appeal did not go through. The science teacher when asked broke down why she was not accepting the appeal, I wish she was nicer (she was professional, just a tad blunt) about it but it boiled down to they do not trust her to not distract other students or trust her to behave during labs. She basically was a safety risk that the teacher did not wish to put up with and it would be unfair to the other student. I agree with this.\r  \n\r  \nMy daughter did not take it well when that happened and hurled some insults at the teacher which proved her point. She was punished for that, and was quite upset about missing the program. It really helped her to mature though. She stopped being the class clown, started to focus on stuff and just behaved. I wasn't called in for the rest of the year. I was worried her attitude would change during the summer but that didn't happen.\r  \n\r  \nSo we sent her to a STEM camp during the summer since she was interested and she was good, the people gave her glowing reviews and she has a real talent for engineering. She is also happier in general, and her missing the program helped her make friends outside of her friend group. She is still good friends with her friend group that went to the program\r  \n\r  \nNow she will be starting highschooler soon and she is going to take some classes with her friends that went to the program. She is going into the chemical and engineering track, which she is really excited for.\r  \n\r  \nThank you for everyone that responded on the post when it first came up, everything really seems to be looking up", "created_utc": 1690230968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158m9q4/update_aita_for_not_appealing_to_the_school_to/", "score": 330, "replies": ["It so nice to hear great updates!!! Continue encouraging her and remind her that actions have consequences.  Good luck to you all!!!", "[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz8o0u/aita_for_not_appealing_to_the_school_to_get_my/?ref=share&ref_source=link)", "Sounds like things worked out really well! And good on you for rewarding her improved behavior with that STEM camp.", "This is a great update! Honestly, it's great that that teacher was very blunt to her - it sounds like she wouldn't have gotten it if it were sugar coated.", "That's an awesome update. I hope she continues to do well! Keep encouraging her, seems she can go far if she just puts her mind to it.", "I love when updates are like this! Congratulations to your daughter on growing up a little and good job supporting her appeal but not doing it for her. That\u2019s some A+  parenting!", "Great update though I've been surprised no one has mentioned getting her diagnosed for add/adhd. She is exhibiting the same symptoms I have personally witnessed. One example is my bfs nephew was diagnosed at 6. He's a piano player, soccer player and child model. My bfs sister mentioned that he has the same behavior as his nephew sometimes so he was eventually diagnosed. He was a good kid and talented and is very successful but he wishes he had been diagnosed and medicated sooner. It's worth a try. She sounds like a good kid just very distracted and anxious. It is always unfortunate to have to deprive a child an opportunity at higher learning, both the distraction and the distracted lose in that situation", "You, OP, are a fantastic parent.  Look at how your daughter grew and matured thanks to your guidance!", "Sometimes consequences are the best teacher.", "Thank you!", "Yeah, one of my 8th grade teachers explained what track level they all decided I should be in for all of my high school classes (we took a test, but then they consulted with our teachers\u2026 us catholic schools) and was sorta blunt. She was like we put you in the highest tracks for a few subjects, but if you are struggling you can ask to go to the middle range. I was affronted. Which is what she wanted me to be. I put little to no effort in school and she damn well knew it and by acting like she thought I couldn\u2019t do it lit a fire of spite under my ass. I got deans list the whole year. Then I was like I showed her (I didn\u2019t) and went back to just doing the minimum. \n\nI wasn\u2019t the class clown, but it was easy for me and I can understand the daughter a bit. I wouldn\u2019t have done well moving up bc it was effort I didn\u2019t want to extend especially on a regular basis.", "happy cake day <3", "Wow, I didn't notice! Thanks!"]}
