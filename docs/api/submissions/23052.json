So after the post I took the suggestion of a few people and had here do the whole process to get an appeal from the school. So she did the paperwork and prepared to plead her case to the heads of the program.\r  \n\r  \nShe did pretty well and wrote a pretty good essay on why she wanted to appeal and why she believes she should be in the program. She also did well when she was pleading her case to the heads of the program which was a science teacher. She is a strict women and I didn't expect much when it happened, and my daughters appeal did not go through. The science teacher when asked broke down why she was not accepting the appeal, I wish she was nicer (she was professional, just a tad blunt) about it but it boiled down to they do not trust her to not distract other students or trust her to behave during labs. She basically was a safety risk that the teacher did not wish to put up with and it would be unfair to the other student. I agree with this.\r  \n\r  \nMy daughter did not take it well when that happened and hurled some insults at the teacher which proved her point. She was punished for that, and was quite upset about missing the program. It really helped her to mature though. She stopped being the class clown, started to focus on stuff and just behaved. I wasn't called in for the rest of the year. I was worried her attitude would change during the summer but that didn't happen.\r  \n\r  \nSo we sent her to a STEM camp during the summer since she was interested and she was good, the people gave her glowing reviews and she has a real talent for engineering. She is also happier in general, and her missing the program helped her make friends outside of her friend group. She is still good friends with her friend group that went to the program\r  \n\r  \nNow she will be starting highschooler soon and she is going to take some classes with her friends that went to the program. She is going into the chemical and engineering track, which she is really excited for.\r  \n\r  \nThank you for everyone that responded on the post when it first came up, everything really seems to be looking up", "created_utc": 1690230968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158m9q4/update_aita_for_not_appealing_to_the_school_to/", "score": 213, "replies": ["It so nice to hear great updates!!!
