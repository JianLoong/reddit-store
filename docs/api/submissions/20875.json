I told him to save that in his savings in case it was wrong.  He then got another refund and told me the same story.

He blatantly lied to you, and used you. I would make him start paying back every single penny he manipulated you out of. That's so disrespectful.", "NTA.  Could you imagine if he pulled this scam with someone that wasn't family?  You're doing him a favor by teaching him now.", "No, do it and don't give him a thing. You are not an idiot but you will be if you let this slide. Until you get back every cent, he gets nothing from you. That's how it should be.", "NTA; he lied in a big way. Get reimbursed for everything and then send him into the real world with nothing so he can learn about consequences.", "NTA. Your son took advantage of your generosity.", "NTA\n\nOP, you need to his ass down and get to the bottom of this. It sounds like he has ditched school and is living on his own with what I\u2019m assuming is thousands of dollars at his disposal.\n\nCharging him rent doesn\u2019t make sense. The whole point of setting him up with an apartment was for school, so if there is no school then there should be no apartment. Find out what he did, and where *your* money is/went.", "YWNBTA. You had a deal that you would pay his tuition and his rent if he was in college. He chose not to hold up his end of the deal, so he owes you both tuition and rent.

However he is working full time and he isnt in your basement.  SO....\n\nSUGGESTION\nSo I'd cut the financial support completely and see how he does in being selfsufficiant. \nLet him know that you have deducted all schooling related costs from his inheritance but you will forgive the lying and stealing. Your trust will need to be earned back.\n\nTell him not to expect any financial assistance in the future until he has given you a written apology that explicitly details his deceptions and the ways he imagines it has impacted you and his family.\nThis includes no moving back in or gas money ......

He lied and took your money under false pretenses, which is stealing. \n\nThat\u2019s great he\u2019s working because he should now be fully supporting himself. Hope he has car/health insurance. If he wanted to ever actually go back to school, don\u2019t contribute a dime. Maybe offer to let him live at home and work if he\u2019s also paying with his own money to be a full time student and actually attends classes, after he pays you back every cent. But time to learn some tough love lessons about character and consequences and being an adult. Ywbta if you gave him another cent.", "YWNBTA! He lied about what he was using the money for and took your money. He's an adult and in a way that is actually illegal. Get it all back.", "NtA. Get the refund . The money was for school and rent to be near the school . He didn\u2019t do school so no need for the rent .", "Wow.  NTA.  The only silver lining for you, is this happened the first semester!  Can you imagine if he faked his way like that for four years, blowing all that money?    \nSo, if you're saying you want the rent AND the tuition, does that mean he didn't \"save\" it the way you asked him to?   I would not pay another penny towards college or apartment, nor would I have him move back in with you.  He obviously figured out how to enjoy a work/life balance vs an academic program, so be it.  He should work and live and enjoy his life, but not in your home anymore.  He's now a working adult.   Many, many people f up or don't finish college the first time.  But some then decide a few or more years later that they're ready and they pay their own way through and are the better for it.  Of course you love him, emotionally support him and want him to do well, but coddling and propping him up now, after he lied so easily to you for a full semester and blew your money, will see him repeating this lying pattern over and over the rest of his life.  You gave him a chance to go to college, he showed you who and how he is.  Believe him.", "NTA\n\nDepending on how you look at it he either stole or committed fraud.", "I guess as a mother I was hoping he would eventually tell me the truth and I was a little bit hoping he was being truthful about the tuition I paid.", "You know you'll never get it back right? He's going to have to get a job to pay his bills, it's unlikely he will have anything to give you.\n\nWrite it off and learn from it. He gets no more. And he's got to prove himself to be a trustworthy member of society if he wants back into the will. He's had his inheritance. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut I don't know what you are going to get back.  At minimum it should be the tuition because that was refunded because he withdrew.  The rent is a gray area.  Yes it was contingent on him going to school and he reneged on that.  But he's your child and if he doesn't have the capacity to pay it back, it's like getting blood from a stone.\n\nWhat's the plan going forward.  Obviously stop paying the rent but is the lease in your name and does someone need to keep paying till it ends.  If it's in his name and he's not paying, he'll be evicted.  But if it's in your name, you'll still be expected to pay it.  He either needs to give notice or your name off the lease and his replacing yours if he wants to stay.\n\nIs the plan for him to come home?  Does he have a job?  Was he going to now go to community college if he comes home.\n\nIt's a catch 22 for you really.  He comes home and if he doesn't get a job (and pay some board) or go to school... what are you going to do?\n\nRegardless of whether he moves back, he still needs a job and he needs to support himself.", "NTA exactly but demanding he repay the rent as well as the tuition does not seem to me to be the best move.  He\u2019s not going to have access to enough funds to repay the rent, pay the current rent and buy his own groceries. Okay, you haven\u2019t said you\u2019re cutting off all financial support but OP, you have a problem beyond your son scamming you and taking advantage of you.  Sadly, I fear that this is just the beginning of an adulthood as as a sleazy conniver who does what he can get away with.  Perhaps consulting professionals - psychological, legal, etc. - can get you some guidance about how to proceed. It\u2019s heartbreaking.  I suppose it\u2019s possible that now that he\u2019s had his fling he\u2019ll straighten himself and become honest, but\u2026. It\u2019s heartbreaking.", "NTA but stop letting your awful son take advantage of you. If your name is the one on the lease, give notice to the landlord and let your son know when the gravy train ends and stop providing him any additional money. If your son\u2019s name is on the lease just immediately stop financially providing for him full stop, let him know that should he be evicted that the cost of returning home is returning the tuition and rent  money he swindled you out of and let him sink or swim. Just because he is your son doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept being treated like shit."]}
