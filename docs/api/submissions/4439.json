If friend doesn't like it, that's their problem.", "If you're vegan, you should be prepared to bring your own food. Is it nice when people cater to us? Does it give us warm fuzzies that someone cares enough to make sure we're fed? Yes, absolutely! Does that mean we should expect it or think we're entitled to that, particularly if we're so picky about the already limited selection of plant foods? No. If we don't like the food choices our friends are willing to offer, we're perfectly capable of making decisions about whether to keep those people as friends. Your friend is TA for acting entitled, refusing to help, and making negative comments about a good faith effort on your part to accommodate them. \n\nBut, I sort of agree with your friend that it's a little rude to ask them to bring something and not ask anyone else to bring something. Planning the whole meal for that many people definitely sounds stressful, but would it not also reduce your stress if someone else took care of drinks, or a side, or brought a non-vegan dessert? Are there non-vegan dishes you could easily veganize for everyone's enjoyment, thus reducing your workload? I'm not entirely sure here if the goal is to passive aggressively call out this person for being an insufferable moocher, or if you're really just trying to reduce your stress levels. \n\nI don't think your little-rude rises to asshole levels, therefore NTA, but I think there are more effective ways to both reduce your workload and address your friend's crappy attitude, up to and including not inviting them to future dinner parties.", "NTA\n\nI have to wonder why you invited this friend to a turkey dinner.
