You did nothing unreasonable.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, your friend sounds exhausting, entitled, and more effort than their company is worth. I'd be rethinking inviting them next year.", "NTA - Stop inviting this demanding difficult person over!", "NTA, \n\nheck, just uninvite them.\n\nIf picky eaters don't like what is being served, they don't have to eat it.

I just bring a veg meal, side, or dessert from a local restaurant or bakery.\n\nPoint being: Making others feel responsible for your dietary choices is the exact opposite way to be a responsible vegetarian/vegan.\n\nFrankly this friend is probably undeserving of the graciousness and hospitality you seem to give them.", "NTA...

This is a variant/inverse of another common post here, which is the vegan guest who wants to bring their own plate of food, but is worried (or it has been made clear to them) that the host would be upset with this, and ends up leaving or not eating.\n\nIn this situation, the poster is generally NTA, so in this case you being a willing host must also be NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf they aren't a pleasant guest to have over, you could just stop inviting them.", "Stop inviting this \u201cfriend \u201c.", "NTA. But, OP, why do you keep inviting this woman? I would straight out tell her you're exhausted from making her special dishes that she complains about, so she can bring her own food, or she can not come to the event. Those are her choices moving forward.", "NTA.  I can only cook a certain number of things, so I\u2019m terrible at dealing with dietary restrictions for guests I\u2019m cooking for.  If I can\u2019t cook it, others need to bring it or not be surprised when it\u2019s not edible.- or be happy with the raw vegetables in the fridge.", "YTA for inviting someone you don't actually want at a dinner party. This problem is entirely your fault. You know the friend has food issues. If you don't want to accommodate them don't invite that friend in the first place.", "NTA Just buy a package of Oreos, they're vegan and a dessert. If friend doesn't like it, that's their problem.", "If you're vegan, you should be prepared to bring your own food. Is it nice when people cater to us? Does it give us warm fuzzies that someone cares enough to make sure we're fed? Yes, absolutely! Does that mean we should expect it or think we're entitled to that, particularly if we're so picky about the already limited selection of plant foods? No. If we don't like the food choices our friends are willing to offer, we're perfectly capable of making decisions about whether to keep those people as friends. Your friend is TA for acting entitled, refusing to help, and making negative comments about a good faith effort on your part to accommodate them. \n\nBut, I sort of agree with your friend that it's a little rude to ask them to bring something and not ask anyone else to bring something. Planning the whole meal for that many people definitely sounds stressful, but would it not also reduce your stress if someone else took care of drinks, or a side, or brought a non-vegan dessert? Are there non-vegan dishes you could easily veganize for everyone's enjoyment, thus reducing your workload? I'm not entirely sure here if the goal is to passive aggressively call out this person for being an insufferable moocher, or if you're really just trying to reduce your stress levels. \n\nI don't think your little-rude rises to asshole levels, therefore NTA, but I think there are more effective ways to both reduce your workload and address your friend's crappy attitude, up to and including not inviting them to future dinner parties.", "NTA\n\nI have to wonder why you invited this friend to a turkey dinner. Anyway, you asked if this friend could bring a vegan dessert, yet the friend seemed to believe you wanted them to make the dessert. What happened to the possibility of buying a ready-made dessert?\n\nThe dinner will be a lot of work, but the cuisine of the 1950s gives you a quick and easy solution for a dessert: A Jell-O (to use a brand name) mold. There must be thousands of recipes online; many are dairy-free and vegan; it can be made in advance; it doesn't take long to make; and the ingredients are inexpensive. \n\nIn the future, don't invite this friend to any meal involving meat.", "And I would bet he has not reciprocated in hosting any events!", "Jello has gelatin. It isn't vegan. It isn't even vegetarian. Or kosher for that matter.\nI would just accept her refusal and not provide a vegan dessert. She can do without."]}
