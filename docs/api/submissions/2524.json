She was still in diapers at the time, and she woundup doing a blowout poop.\n\nAll parents know what that means.\n\nLuckily, the inlaws had a mattress cover. and most of the poop was contained in the diaper, with just a bit spilling out. But it got on a family quilt that my MIL had for decades.\n\nThey were out at the time, so I had my husband bath our daughter while I washed all of the bedding (even the stuff that had no poop on it, but I was worried about the smell) in the washer, but I got a toothbrush and very carefully cleaned each and every spot that was touched by poop.\n\nI'm talking, I was as careful and methodical as an art restorer. I was not going to let any damage come to that quilt. I was too worried about my MIL being upset about it. She wouldn't have gotten mad at us, but she cared about the quilts and things that were made by her family.\n\nI told her what happened, but by then everything was clean and dry and you couldn't tell anything bad had happened.\n\nTHAT's what you do when a member of your party poops in the bed.

This demented reaction is precisely how you know you're doing the right thing by giving Annie even a chance at having a remotely pleasant holiday. Annie was never going to spend Thanksgiving with Carol and Cathy because, obvs, they're miserable trolls. Effectively what Carol is saying is that she'd rather her daughter spend Thanksgiving alone than with you, which is a pretty good indicator of why her family is avoiding her like the plague. Either way, Carol is acting like a lunatic because you were kind to Annie after she opted to remove herself from that lunacy. Yep, it all sounds pretty predictably par for the Carol course, but it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong. Don't let Carol & and Cathy's shrieking needle its way into your brain and cause you to perceive this situation any differently than it really is. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nenjoy the holidays with the family who care about you.", "NTA\n\nAnnie had no plans with them, so she accepted your invite. Good for you and your husband (and Annie) that you still have a relative you  get along well with. \n\nAnd it's not your place to school MIL why she has this outcome with her kids, that's Annie and your husband's.", "I hope you got the scat pic or just say you don\u2019t approve of scat play in your home by anyone not willing to clean up after themselves, and how you support people into alt lifestyles but scat play shouldn\u2019t be something forced upon you.

You and your husband aren't going to spend the holiday with your ILs.  Your SIL Annie isn't going to spend the holiday with her family either. Y'all do get along with each other.\n\nOf course you're NTA for inviting Annie to join your family. Carol and Cathy have no say in what you are going to do regardless. But in that you aren't spending it with them anyway, they really don't have a say.\n\nFrom the sounds, all they're trying to do is guilt trip all y'all into isolating yourselves from each other. They know that together you have community and fellowship... without them. But if you're by yourselves, you (really your husband and Annie) might miss family, \"repent the error of your ways\" and go back to them.\n\nIgnore them and enjoy your Thanksgiving with your family and your SIL. May your turkey be moist, your gravy without lumps and your company convivial.", "NTA\n\nYou were gracious towards Annie.\n\nIf Annie feels more comfortable spending the holiday with your parents instead of her own, that's a reflection on them.\n\nContinue your NC and LC with Cathy and Carol, and enjoy your drama free holiday.", "NTA. Annie is old enough to make her own decisions. Also, I think it\u2019s kind of you to invite her and her family to your side\u2019s thanksgiving.

However, I'm so over them, I don't care. Which is why I wanted to be sure I was thinking clearly. Family is a messy business. Thank you!", "Nice!  \u2018Lint in your drier\u201d.", "Haha! It is a cluster. If you want more details, check out my profile. In regards to the honeymoon, my husband and I are more financially stable than everyone else. Cathy's car broke down, so she spent her honeymoon funds on a new car. That's why she asked us to pay for her honeymoon. I declined, and was told I was sabotaging her wedding and marriage. \ud83e\udd37", "You are right! Both view themselves as victims. It's exhausting to be honest.", "Ha! I have ignored every single message they have sent for a few weeks. It just puts my husband in a horrible spot with his family.", "Oh! That's a good idea. Lol", "Ha! Carol didn't quite believe Cathy left poo until my husband confirmed it. Carol swears there must have been a reason...", "As a parent, I have been there before too! My BIL was the one to explain \"there was an accident on the bed\" when they were leaving to go back home. I honestly thought it was \"the time of the month\" not poo. I had to throw out my brand new duvet. After that, I went NC.", "Thank you. You make an excellent point. My hubby really should be dealing with why he is NC.", "Haha! I did take a pic. My hubby was there too. I made him take out the duvet to the trash since he thought the visit went well. \ud83e\udd28", "Yeah, they are definitely trying to guilt trip.

My hubby does.", "Pardon my language but fuck Cathy.....and of course by being a normal human you were sabotaging their wedding....\n\nEdit: Now I\\`m intrigued I\\`ll have to go take a look at past posts", "Block them and hubby should too.  It\u2019ll really push their buttons.  He needs to realize they brought this on themselves.", "Your husband needs to learn no is a complete sentence.", "Yeah, the reason is Cathy is batshit crazy. Unless you're a baby or someone with continence issues, there's never a reason to leave poop anywhere but in the toilet.", "There was.  They pooped in your bed.", "Ha! Enjoy! They have been cathartic for me to get out. It's been exhausting dealing with it.", "Yeah, he does. I think he is getting guilty because of the holidays. I get it, but our kids deserve a good time too.", "She said she was \"too sunburned\" to wipe.", "Pardon me for being crude, but if her butthole is sunburnt she may need to wear more clothes. Sheesh.", "That is total bs.", "Ha! No we went to the beach the day before, Ave she didn't apply sunscreen.

Your doing whats best for your family and not creating drama where there is none. Plus calling your nana? She IS family, so it IS her buisness especially when they are bringing her into it by calling.\n\nNTA.\n\nI also read your previous Cathy post. 100% agree on avoiding at all costs.", "I\u2019m in awe that they were upset with you for not paying for THEIR honeymoon.

Please don't take away her opportunity to have a sane Thanksgiving.", "Uh, looking at your other responses, how was her *intentionally choosing not to wipe her butt* an \u201caccident\u201d? She knew she had poop all over her butt.\n\nAlso, how tf do you get poop all over sheets after not wiping unless you\u2019re either shoving the sheet up your crack or somehow\u2026getting it all over yourself as you poop ????
