That was entirely unnecessary.  You can validate the choice to be child free without being an insensitive jerk. That was not your information to share.  Fyi, all that extra info about the circumstances of her pregnancy did not make your case better.  Its so much worse that you were party to this nonsense and then had the gall to say that to her child.", "YTA. I understand this was sort of an unfortunate slip up, but you need to apologize to both of them. \n\nFirst of all, no kid wants to hear that they were not wanted - your sister now has a ton of emotional work to put into her relationship with her kid.\n\nSecond, you have not business suggesting to a 9 YEAR OLD CHILD that they might change their mind about kids later on. She\u2019s 9. Leave her alone. I didn\u2019t want kids when I was 9 either. Many people in their 20s still don\u2019t want kids only to change their mind a few years later.\n\nGo apologize and do something to make your family feel extra loved.", "Yta.

Apologize over and over, your probably traumatized this poor kid. Goodness", "YTA from what it sounds like, your sister was possibly assaulted and family guilted her into an unwanted pregnancy. She will hold that trauma forever, regardless how much she loves her daughter. You telling niece she wasn't wanted is kicking your sister while she's already down. Not to mention, your niece doesn't need that feeling projected onto her. Pro-life should mean your family is pro-loving and caring of your sister, too.", "YTA, softly though.\n\nIt was a slip up, but still. Kids are impressionable,  they learn from and through us. Being a parent you should know this.\n\nI never believed i wanted kids either. Was adamant about it when younger. But i met my ex wife and just like that my views changed. I could go on about how wonderful she is but pointless.\n\nI make it a point to never lie to my kids. So first time they asked me if i wanted kids and how many i phrased it that i never \"thought\" i would have any. Never \" thought \" i would marry. I don't blatantly say i never wanted kids, they can't grasp my perspective of that, my mindset or circumstances behind the reasoning.

Wtf is wrong with u", "Yes, yes, yes YTA. There is so much more going on in this post than what you\u2019re saying. I get the feeling you judge your sister harshly for her choices, which you have no right to do. And when you say \u201cunfortunate circumstances\u201d, are you really referring to r*ape? If that\u2019s the case, you are so far over the line of unacceptable that there\u2019s no coming back.", "That's definitely not something you should have told her. Now, my aunt did tell me the same thing, but a) I was an adult and b) it was to correct the lie my mom had been spreading about my dad not wanting kids (he desperately wanted kids, was an amazing father). Otherwise my aunt would have taken that information to her grave. I processed it well because I already suspected the truth and because I was an adult. I can't imagine how I would have felt as a 9- year old.", "YTA and deserve whatever no-contact situation you end up in.

No doubt you love your children but sounds like you have a distinct lack of empathy and sensitivity when it comes to your niece.\n\nSounds like your sister had post natal depression and you haven't. PND is a serious mental condition which your sister was very unlucky to get. It was not her fault.", "YTA that\u2019s not something you tell children. How would you feel if someone told your child that?", "Yeah, YTA.", "YTA. Such an incredible asshole. You don\u2019t tell a child that her mother didn\u2019t want her.

Of course she didn\u2019t want a baby at 15.", "At a visit with extended family when I was maybe 14, my father said \"Who would have kids if they had time to think about it?\" I'm 35 now, and that still hurts.

Control your words better for heavens sake, you\u2019re an adult. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m pro-choice as well and you\u2019re still an asshole, this isn\u2019t about your beliefs, just your words alone.", "YTA.

Its bad enough your niece will one day find out she's the child of **** but you go and say this? Geesh", "Yes, YTA.", "YTA 1000x.....sounds like you shouldn't have ever been around kids at all!!! Who in their right mind says that to a child?? Especially in relation to violent, adult acts. \n\nYou are just a hurtful and spiteful person, who enjoys harming others.

That\u2019s something she\u2019s not going to forget.", "Wow. YTA. What person on Earth, especially a child, wants to hear that they weren't wanted?", "as someone who\u2019s mom had them conceived while on birth control and had her tubes tied after giving birth to them, YTA. you know how many times ive thought she didnt want me and i didnt have disrespectful aunts like you telling me to my face? YTA YTA YTA. \n\ni still got it from my siblings, but it\u2019s kinda an unspoken rule that regretful things get said by siblings that fight growing up. i wouldnt expect my aunt to say something like that to me", "YTA why would you ever think saying that to a child is acceptable? Congrats, she\u2019s never going to forget you saying that.", "YTA. And yeah, people are going to make assumptions about you based on that comment, because it is SUCH a sh*tty and awful thing to say to a 9 year old, something that most people would never DREAM of saying, that it feels like there HAS to be something more going on. Do better.", "Are you just being purposefully ignorant to hurt a 9 year old or what? YTA", "YTA. You're prolife but rub in your niece's face that she was not wanted. What is the logic?", "YTA\nYou don't say these things to children, especially when they are not yours. \n\nHeck even I was hurt at 18 when my mother told me I shouldn't start with children because they mess up your life. And yes I know how she 'meant' it and she 'forgot' she was talking to her actual daughter, but it doesn't make it less hurtful to hear.", "YTA. Holy shit dude, why put those thoughts into a kids head at all? There's no reasonablility to what you did", "The audacity you have to even justify it\n\nUndoubtedly YTA", "YTA you\u2019re doing a lot of blame shifting to your sister. It\u2019s ok to not want kids. It\u2019s ok to also change your mind. Your niece is far too young to have that conversation with. You\u2019re just trying to ease your guilt but you\u2019re 100% in the wrong here and this is not a situation where a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d will fix it. Although I doubt you\u2019ve even offered an apology that didn\u2019t include blaming others.", "YTA. That\u2019s a horrible thing to say to a child.", "Yep YTA. My sister told me when I was 9 or 10 ( she was 19) that I was an accident, my parents didn't want another baby, and that my mom was pissed about being pregnant again. That hurt and insecurity stuck with me for a couple decades, and I had some hate for my sister for saying that to me. It's a gut punch to hear, but especially from someone you love.", "YTA Yes. A thousand times yes. Any thinking person would know beyond doubt that this was a terrible, terrible thing to say to any child. And frankly, your excuse of speaking offhandedly is lame, and as a mother, you know that you always have to think before you speak when you're talking to a child.\n\nI'll be straight with you OP, your post comes across as you feeling like you are somehow a better mother because you have always wanted children, while your sister is somehow inferior for not having wanted children when she herself was a child. And yet, your sister loves her daughter even by your own admission.\n\nWas it necessary for you to have to tell us that the circumstances of your niece's conception were unfortunate? Or that your sister fell into post-partum depression after your niece was born? I am a woman who wanted children for as long as I can remember, but I was hit hard with postpartum depression after each of my children was born. So I can say without reservation that the issue of PPD has absolutely no connection with how much a mother wants or love a child.\n\nIt feels to me as though you were just waiting for a moment to say this nasty thing to your niece, whether consciously or subconsciously, and you finally got your moment. I don't know how you can sleep at night. Imagine if your sister ever said something equally as horrible to any of your children. You should be ashamed. And you also need to look in the mirror and ask yourself honestly if what I have guessed about you is correct. I hope not. But sadly, I don't think that I'm wrong.", "YTA\n\nThats not a slip of the tongue or back handed comment, that is a absolutely atrocious thing and deliberately thought out thing to say to a 9yr old.\n\nI think we can all take a good guess what the unfortunate circumstance is/was. But your sister was 15. A child herself. \n\nShe didn't have to go along with YOUR narrative on HER situation to make YOU feel better. What she tells HER daughter about her conception is your sisters business.", "YTA the comment you made is going to be in your nieces head for a very long time. shame on you.", "YTA, and I\u2019m pretty sure you already know it. I get the the sentiment of the comment, but that\u2019s not at all how you should have phrased it.", "YTA and a huge one.  You told a child in essence that her mother didn't then nor now wants children and what a 9 year old heard was you are a burden on your mother and she doesn't love her.  On top of it you said you had the opportunity to change the narrative, but you CHOSE not to.  The discussion about people's choice to have children is NOT yours to have.  \n\n\nBeing Prochoice has NOTHING to do with this.  you are straight 100% an AH", "Not buying you didn't say that on purpose. Willing to bet you are one of those people that are pissed your sister had a kid and it isn't all about just yours. \n\n1000% the asshole and I hope your sister cuts all contact with you.", "YTA", "YTA, christ on a bike. So many little 'offhand' comments that adults make to children can be absolutely devastating, for years they can stay in your hea, and can contribute towards low self-esteem and self sabotaging behaviours amongst other things. Don't fall for the narrative you're telling yourself that your niece is over it, your behaviour is super shitty. Children often aren't able to understand adult perspectives or circumstances.  \nIt's not your sister's job to explain your comment and makes things ok (assuming your niece hasn't taken what you said to heart), you should be apologising profusely to the both of them, and frankly, you should learn to control what comes out of your mouth.  \nAlso, not sure why your options are either saying hurtful things or convincing a 9 year old everyone should have children... no amount of circus tricks in your mind should convince you that you're not a massive asshole in this.", "Even the way you meant to say it is not ok to say to a child because no matter what they\u2019ll take it as \u201cmy mother didn\u2019t want me\u201d and the fact that in your explanation you say:\n\n>it may just been easier to say the joke was a joke or to apologise at this stage\n\n1\u2022you should have a apologized *immediately* because you never should have said it\n\n2\u2022the fact that your first thought is to say it was a joke and your second thought is to apologize says a lot about the type of person you are. Learn to own up to it when you\u2019ve done something wrong and apologize first, not make up lies and excuses. YTA", "In these circumstances, I feel like intention means a lot. And it sounds like you didn't INTENTIONALLY say what you said to hurt your niece. Sounds like it was just an absent-minded slip. And that happens. We all make mistakes. We've all said things we probably shouldn't have, at some point in our lives. \n\nBut, that being said, it doesn't erase the damage that could be done by what you said. Even if you didn't mean for it to be hurtful, kids internalize everything. So, when you said her mom didn't want kids, what she heard was that she wasn't wanted, her mom didn't want her. And even if that was initially the case, a 9 year old doesn't need to know that. And even though she's \"over it\", that could have been (or still could be) very damaging to a child's self-esteem, etc. So, I'm torn with my ruling.   \n\n\nYou didn't mean to say something hurtful, but you did end up hurting her and you upset your sister in the process. So, I guess I have to go with YTA for this one.", "Yeah YTA and a major one at that.

This means I hadn't been allowed to eat for 2 days, while my body is being physically assaulted by the birthing process. I started to get an infection and had a fever. Also, it's difficult to sleep while actively in labor so no sleep either. Add the pain of childbirth and you can see that I was soooo miserable. Then include my health issues that had caused my doctor to require an induction... When my son was finally born I said \"it's over, tale him away\". They had to take him anyway because he had a fever... which was just transfered heat from me. That said, after 20-30 minutes of sleep and a quick taco later, I was ready and excited to see my newborn son. Do you think I *ever* just blurted out to him that my first words after he was born was \"Take him away?\" Eventually he was told but I told him carefully. \n\nYTA because you have to watch what/how you say things to kids. It's easy to make them feel unwanted/unloved. As a mom, you already should've known that. Think about how you would feel if someone had said something like that to one of your children. I don't think you would be so nonchalant about it.", "YTA what the hell is wrong with you? You have done irreversible damage to that child and you're trying to justify it away. You obviously think you hold some moral high ground over your sister. Get over yourself", "Open mouth and insert foot....\n\nI don't think there is a way to fix that.

But honestly, just telling a 9 year old her mother didnt want them, YTA", "NTA plenty of people don\u2019t want kids and then change their minds and end up being great parents.", "YTA. Your sister not wanting kids as a child doesn't mean shit. I don't think a lot of children think oh I want kids when they're kids. Girls are obviously conditioned into the concept of motherhood from a very young age but regardless of that, in my experience, I've never heard anyone say ooohh I wanted kids since I was a child. Becoming a parent or not isn't a stable idea even in adulthood much less in childhood. It depends a lot on circumstances, timing, attitude, mental health, etc. I don't necessarily know what you mean by 'unfortunate circumstances', like do you mean she wanted an abortion but because your family is pro-life, she felt forced to have the child or was the conception a result of trauma like SA, so I'm not really sure about the circumstances but regardless of the circumstances, her going into a depression after having a child doesn't automatically mean that didn't want her daughter. Postpartum depression is real, sucks and isn't limited to cases where the mother didn't want the child. Also, are you assuming that she didn't want the child because as a child herself she didn't want to have kids, due to the unfortunate circumstances, or because you actually had a conversation with her during her pregnancy where she told you straight up that she didn't want the child? Because if it's either of the first two scenarios, you don't actually know if she didn't want her daughter and now you've created trauma for her daughter where there didn't need to be any. Also, you saying that niece is 'over' it doesn't mean anything. Children don't operate like that. A lot of the trauma can manifest later on in life, especially if you're led to believe that you were unwanted by your parents. So yeah, YTA, not just because it was a thoughtless comment but you don't seem to realise why your sister is justifiably mad at you and seem kind of dismissive about her anger towards you for saying things that are absolutely not your place to say. She's nine. I can't understand what made you think that a nine year old had the emotional or mental maturity to take that comment in any way other than hurtful and harmful. Especially as you say, you're pro-choice. Your response could have been limited to 'That's fine. That's your choice'.", "NTA id say but the phrasing might have just been a bit off.  \nAs you said I think your sister also knows how you meant but didn't take it as that never the less.", "NAH.

Especially since her sister had PPD after.\n\nBesides, the unfortunate circumstances might be \"sister had a one night stand and got pregnant\" or \"sister's teenaged boyfriend jumped ship and refused to be a father\" or simply \"sister was a teenager and had to drop out of school to have kids\" or \"sister and niece ended up poor because sister dropped out of school and parents couldn't support them\".   \n\n\nNot every child in a single parent household is a product of rape - it's a possibility, yes, but there are also many other reasons it might have been unfortunate.  But if it WAS SA, OP is even more of an asshole for being passive aggressively snarky about it all.", "The sister was a minor.

We ASSUME that there was pressure from the parents (and there probably was), but OP is doing a good job of making the situation about herself and her scruples and not her sister's feelings or needs.   \n\n\nIf I'd been pressured into having a baby that I now adored, the LAST thing I would want is for my holier-than-thou sister to be bringing it up sarcasitcally to my kid.", "Yeah purple is fear.

I think people are projecting their own childhood trauma into this situation, or they\u2019re triggered because you mentioned politics in your post.

I totally agree OP is TA for making such an insensitive comment (and for trying to justify that she\u2019s not an AH because she didn\u2019t mean to be one), but have none of you ever said something offhand that you didn\u2019t think through all the way? You always think thoroughly and tactfully before speaking? There\u2019s no reason to assign malice to this; OP spoke without thinking and said something hurtful. You do not have to be willfully evil to be an asshole.", "Possibly, though it may have been consensual sex where the condom broke.", "People love to say they're pro-choice until the women they're talking about make the 'wrong' one.", "the edit just makes it look like it was tit for tat.", "Yeah, OP should get the good stuff.

But an apology and a kind gesture can go a long way. You know, do a little bonding? Make some happy memories? Maybe the kid can sit on mom\u2019s lap while they watch the movie.

A mistake like this is an opportunity to learn.\n\nAll adults accidentally say dumb shit to their kids (or kids that they babysit) at some point.

If you take issue take it to the parents of the teen. Let the mom enjoy the child she clearly wants NOW damn, not every single feeling ends up being followed with action.

I've said and done some AH-level things in my life; I'm sure we all have. It doesn't mean you're the worst person ever and you need to beat yourself up for the rest of your life.

It's irrelevant to this current situation but I think a teenager would be better equipped to actually have a conversation like this and take their mom's perspective in a more accurate way (e.g. \"maybe she thought she didn't want kids/worried she wouldn't like being a mom, but clearly she loves me\") without being hurt by it", "Exactly, the only comment needed was 'and that's completely your choice!'", "She was really expecting a 9yo to stop and listen/ think trough and rationalize it like an adult?  \nMy mom once said I made her life dificult when I was around that age and i ONLY got to process this at 24 when i went to therapy...you should think 5 times about what you're gonna say to children", "\\*hugs\\*", "It\u2019s a 9 year old.
