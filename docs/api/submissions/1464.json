{"id": 1464, "submission_id": "ymjply", "title": "AITA For Yelling at My Grandpa?", "selftext": "So my grandparents Joan (f60+) And Roger (m72) came to visit us we got a new kitten last year (stray) and she turns one in a few days. Everytime our family friends kid comes to our house to pet/hold all of our animals (we have a lot 1 turtle, 1 dog, 1 cat and we are fostering 2 ducklings and 3 fish) he always wants to come over when we are napping and or don't want company, he decides to try and scare our cat. This triggers her instincts and she thinks we're playing. I always let her know when we play and when we don't I properly discipline (I e. I give her a snack on the butt and she lets go) well when she reacts and jumps forward he runs and she chases him. She a kitten and doesn't know better because he does this everytime. Well my grandpa sees this and the kid gets scared and he yells her and says things like, \"you do that again and I'll throw you outside by the scruff and you'll live outdoors again!\". My grandparents don't live with us and we live in Hawaii she isn't old enough to live on her own outside and doesn't know how to properly take care ( I know she's a cat but she's very spoiled). My Grandpa thinks that she is old enough to remember the streets and that she's always gonna be like this. Well I (f14) am extremely protective of all of them. My dog is my best friend and  my car is super sweet but super energetic and my turtle and I sometimes take naps together. The two ducklings are going to a duck rescue this weekend. I hear this all of the time from him specifically when my grandma isn't there and it's just us three. I started yelling at him and saying things like \"she isn't your cat and you have no say in what happens to her!\" And \"you throw her out and you might be staying in a hotel!\".\nWell my mom came against me and smacked me for yelling at my grandpa. My grandma hasn't made a specific stance In this. If my dad was here he'd yell at me for speaking like that. I don't regret anything. He's always comparing my cat to my dog. My dog is an angel but he's also 11. She's not even 1.

You sound like quite the animal person.  I'm glad that you are there to advocate for the animals.  Remember that you can say almost anything if you say it in a neutral tone of voice."]}
