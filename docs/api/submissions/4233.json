I'm proud of you standing up to him!!", "NTA.  Your grandmother would have a point if that was actually what your grandfather objected to.  It would be understandable if he was hurt by not being invited to the \u201creal\u201d wedding.  \n\nAnd, yes, ideally you wouldn\u2019t have lost your temper.

I really hope your grandfather gets over his tantrum and joins everyone for the big church ceremony! It\u2019s sad when people get so twisted up about traditions that they neglect what matters most. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how old he is but if this kind of behavior isn\u2019t normal for him, maybe he should be evaluated by his doctor for dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s. Even if you think he\u2019s too young, it could be early onset. If this is typical behavior from him, unfortunately, he might just be a jerk. \n\nCongratulations to you and your husband!! May you have a lifetime of love and happiness!!", "NTA. Old people don't deserve respect just because they are old. They need to earn it just like everyone else.", "Even IF you needed someone's blessings, it would be your parents. You had that from your mother. Grandpa is SOL. Good for you standing up to him. That's some major overstepping on his part. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour grandfather is obviously still living in the past back when women were considered property (Aren\u2019t we glad those days are over!) \n\nThese days you DON\u2019T need his permission to marry and if he respects you as a person he should respect your choices \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t and continues to vocalise this you may have to reconsider his invite for the official family ceremony\n\nCongrats by the way!", "NTA.\n\nYour grandparents live in another era, where everything goes through the patriarch, and that elderly people deserve inconditional respect. At this time of their life, they won't change their paradigm.\n\nWhile you don't require your grandfather's blessing and don't owe him anything, your reaction could have been similar to your mother's: ignore him, let him talk and enjoy your life with your husband\n\nEDIT: typo", "NTA, your life, your decisions. The audacity that he needs to give his blessing first.", "NTA. You DON'T need or want his blessing and if he and your grandma don't like it they can lump it.

Sounds like you have your grandfather's temper but are otherwise a much nicer person!", "NTA\n\nYou don't need anything from him. He needs to get with the times. The one other thing I'll say is it's strange that he thinks you need his blessing. If anything, you'd \"need\" your father's blessing. I've never heard of someone going to their grandfather for a blessing/permission to get married.", "NTA. So often old people just suck, with their ridiculous demands for preferential treatment. I would probably have told him that yes, he is old, but if he keeps up this behaviour he won't be getting any older! Just for spite I'd seriously consider inviting neither of these grandparents to your church wedding unless they apologised and agreed to keep their mouths shut on the day. I'm seriously sick of the geriatrics acting like dicks and being allowed to get away with it. Don't be the bigger person...be the bigger dick!", "NTA. You\u2019re not his property to give blessing and the whole \u201cyou can\u2019t speak to old people like that\u201d is a massive pile of bullshit and the reason most OAPs are entitled AH", "NTA \u2026. It\u2019s not up to him whether he thinks so or not . It is your special occasion with your partner . He should be happy he\u2019s even invited to the church wedding because with his attitude I\u2019d be telling him he\u2019s not welcome until he changes his tune .", "Nta: it's a generational thing your grandparents aren't wrong for their beliefs either I think it's just what they were taught to believe. \nThey probably have been taught by their parents that eloping is bad but like you said times change and today that's not a bad thing as you were probably taught and have learned. \nYou stood up to your beliefs and your husband's and that's all you can do and it's a respectable thing.\nIt's a gray area where you and your grandparents will probably have to have a long conversation on how you agree to disagree. \nBut I don't think either one of you is wrong you just hold different beliefs.", "You did this one already. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zex403/-/iz8wmai", "I encourage you to not think that people with opposing views than yours as either wrong, or your enemy.  While it is your decision how and where you get married, its helpful to consider that some choices you make may cause reactions.  People of different generations will see things differently than you sometimes.  He could soften his critique.  You could resist the urge to react and tell him to buzz off.  Ratcheting up the tension almost never pays off.  You may not care, but it will spread through the family connections.\n\nNot reacting to his expressed standard puts you in calm control of the entire situation - including the family view .  Reacting at his level puts you at his level.  Not all slights requires a response.  To refuse to respond keeps you on a calm, higher plane.
