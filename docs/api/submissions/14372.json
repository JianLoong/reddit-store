The guy whose room it was pulled out a Go board. For reference, Go is a Asian strategy board game. \n\nHe asked if anybody knew the rules or had played before. I did, and am actually pretty good, but didn\u2019t say anything because I was curious where he was going with this. He explained the rules, and he said he would play anybody for 20 bucks. It was obvious he was trying to make some quick cash from this, but I decided to roll with it.\n\nI played one game, let him beat me easily, and made a show of being frustrated. He suggested another game for 50 dollars. I accepted, lost again, and acted super upset. I said that I was getting the hang of it and was close to winning (I wasn\u2019t, because I still let myself lose spectacularly). I demanded we play a third time, and as a show of how confidence I was, said I\u2019d bet 200 dollars. \n\nHe clearly saw dollar signs, so agreed. This time, I easily beat him, and demanded the 200 dollars. He was incredibly angry when he realized I was playing him the whole time. I told him that he didn\u2019t need to give me 200 but rather just the money he took from me, and he gave it back but then called me TA for conning him like that.\n\nThe way I see it, he deserved it; he started out trying to take money from somebody who thought had no chance. Once he thought he knew I was a horrible player, he doubled down by trying to take more money from me. In essence, he was predatory towards somebody who in his eyes had no experience. He deserved to be taught a lesson, and ultimately, I didn\u2019t even take his money.

You just took the money that he took from you, correct? You literally gave him a taste of his own medicine, and instead of being like him and taking money, you just asked him to return yours. More than fair in my book.", "NTA He was taking advantage of someone he thought they didn't know what they were doing. Regardless he was more than happy to take your money. He's lucky it was you because if it was me I would have taken the money.", "Yeah, it was more about teaching him a lesson for trying to rip people off than the money", "I think he was too blinded by greed to see the obvious con he was walking into", "> Sucks to be him.\n\nWould\u2019ve even more if I hadn\u2019t let him off easy", "You know what else gets you stabbed in some places? Hustling strangers lmfao", "If I deliberately manipulated him for money, how come I didn\u2019t ask him to pay up the money that I won from him? It was about the message, not the money", "\u201cDeliberately manipulated this guy for money\u201d sorry, what money? The 70 bucks that originally belonged to OP? Also you trying to post this on \u201cam I the devil\u201d is so funny.", "> you get kicked out of bars for hustling\n\nNot exactly, but something would get kicked in that bar", "The only lesson he was taught is that he can welch on a bet and get away with it.

Losing the money was the draw, to get his opponent to bet higher and higher until OP could make it all up in one final huge bet. That's how it works??? And thanks, I like to think I'm a funny guy", "Yeah, the person who hustled a stranger lmfao?", "Well it could've cause trouble for the OP considering the attitute of the person , so I think it was a safe bet to not insist.", "Sure, if you\u2019re trying to con people out of money I\u2019ll fuck around with you a little bit.

And he would have a profit of 130 bucks. Instead he has 0 profit because the point was to make an example on trying to earn money off of unsuspecting people.

I cannot believe I have to explain this. Accepting said challenge when you know you're better than the other person, losing on purpose a couple times to lull them into a false sense of security, and then making a bet that makes up for all the money you lost plus a bunch and winning that one *is* hustling. Like, there's nothing to argue here. That's just the definition. Even the OP admits that he hustled somebody. Lmao", "> Not sure it's conning people out of money when you just challenge them to a game, when everyone knows both sides' proficiency lmao, but you do you ig\n\nDoes it really matter if you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s a con when it obviously is?", "I have no idea what you could possibly be trying to communicate with this sentence lmao, but I'm done arguing with people who somehow think they're morally in the right for hustling a stranger out of money, and who continue to argue about it.

What a lesson.", "how is he 'earning money off of unsuspecting people' by offering to play people at Go for money? i don't really understand how any part of his behavior is deceptive? wouldn't somebody who doesn't know the game just not play", "Living for the drama here maybe I should pop some popcorn. Does harping on OP make you feel better about how the majority of people are on their side?", "So I basically called myself a scammer in my title and when somebody else calls me one I\u2019m mad?
