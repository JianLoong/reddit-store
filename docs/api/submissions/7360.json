We volunteered to pay for all lodging for everyone if they could pay for transportation and incidentals.  We invited everyone last July for an April vacation.  We wanted this to be a chance for our immediate family to be together and enjoy the experience and each other. We did not invite any friends or other relatives including my oldest daughter\u2019s (43 F) stepson (20M). This was a hard choice but we knew we had to make some determination otherwise we would be trying to find a place for my in-laws, and some of our friends and a lot of other people we love \n\nLast week my youngest daughter M (35F) and her wife (35F) told me that they had promised their nephew L( 10M) a tropical vacation that was canceled due to Covid. L is a nephew on my daughter-in-law\u2019s side and we have met him a few times, but he is not our relative and not someone any of the other kids or grandkids have a relationship with \n\nAfter my wife and I talked, we told M that we really want them there, but we want this to be \u201cour family\u201d and that we wouldn\u2019t feel right about adding L. L would have slept in the room with M\u2019s kids so there would have been no expense, just a child guest that nobody knows outside of M\u2019s family.\n\nWhen we told M that, M told us that she can\u2019t see taking this vacation without L, and that if we can\u2019t change our minds then they won\u2019t be joining us. \n\nTwo of our kids are saying we did the right thing, otherwise we open the trip up to whoever decides to join. One of our kids is saying we are TA because L would have fun with his cousins and wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden or a time burden on us. \n\nMy wife and I are struggling. We have already excluded people we are close to, when we sent the original invitation. And they had 7 months to bring up L and just told us this week. \n\nTo complicate things, M and her wife have been semi-estranged from us off and on. They tend to drift out of our lives for months at a time until they need something, then they stuck around for a little bit before drifting off again. So I really wanted this to be an experience that all of our kids and grandkids could share. Now my daughter, her wife, and their two sons, who we are least close to, will miss out. \n\nSo should we stick to our guns or are we TA and need to let them bring L?", "created_utc": 1673739677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10c4dm8/aita_for_excluding_my_daughter_from_a_trip_of_a/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Awful. Truly evil step-mother tier BS.", "NTA\n\nThe nephew of your daughter in law, while family, isn't a direct family member and doesn't fall under what you made plans for. It's the DiL's sibling's kid, if you brought him then it could open the door to a bunch of extended family members getting upset for not being invited too or others being like, \"let's bring XYZ too!\" You have to draw the line somewhere and it being with your direct family and their partners / kids is fine to me.\n\nWhat baffles me is why not your daughter's step son? That's more direct connection to your direct family, sure it's not her biological child but still her son, and YTA for that unless I am missing something with that.", "NTA it's one thing to bring their kids. That's still immediate family. And a nephew of the DiL doesn't fall under this. And with all the time they had to bring it up, it's ridiculous to make an issue of it now. \n\nThey made the promise to L, so they can fulfill that promise on a trip they organize.", "No brainer, firstly happy 30th wedding anniversary \n\nYou deserve to enjoy this trip, NTA as L is trying to coerce you into a guest that you don't want there as it will upset the dynamics of who you extended an invite too.\n\nIf L drifts in an out of your lives, I say let them decide if they want to join in.

Like you said you can't invite everyone and you don't even really know this child.", "Definitely NTA. \n\n1. You're not specifically singling out one person to not invite. Many people were not invited. \n\nB. Tell the one kid who said you should invite L that they are welcome to treat him and his parents to a tropical vacation another time, at their own expense.", "[deleted]", "Good thing you used a throwaway. This super-specific scenario will certainly blend right in.", "Info: what's the relevance of not inviting your step grandchild?\n\nAs far as I can tell it just does nothing but make people think less of you right before you ask them for a judgement on not inviting a *different* person?", "Nta....you set up rules and boundaries and they waited until the last minute. Being enstranged until they need you and then ghost....yeah its a no for me...they can plan their own trip if that's the case.", "Have the vacation you want, and invite who you want.  you guys were pretty clear about your criteria for the guests.  I\u2019d bet that if L came along, somehow you would end up with extra expenses for him.", "NTA for not bringing the nephew, I see no reason why you should have to pay for somebody else's promise. You already know what you are for dismissing your daughters stepson though, great way to say you're not our family.", "NTA and idc what anyone says, NTA for the stepson.  NOWHERE in here does it say that daughter raised this child infancy and child is being deliberately excluded.     It's for their nuclear family.   If daughter and her husband (Father of stepson) don't have a problem with it, it's no one's else's business.

He's still close family, not some \"distant relatives.\"", "NTA it's your anniversary and your financing the trip your allowed to invite and exclude whoever you want.

If they really want the kid to tag along they can book and pay for it themselves.", "Nta\n\nThey saw a cut price opportunity to fulfil a promise they made. You said no.\n\nAs for the stepson, given your daughter, his step mother isn't bothered he's not invited, it's probably because He doesn't consider himself part of his step mother's family.", "First, you exclude your step grandson for no reason than he\u2019s not \u201cfamily\u201d which is a dick move. Then you refuse to let a young child. That would not cost you a dime to come on the vacation and alienating your daughter even further. You say you don\u2019t know this kid, but damn, wouldn\u2019t this be an opportunity? If your daughter and her wife are close enough to this child to be taking him on vacations, then most likely they spend a lot of time with him and he would maybe be at other family functions with you.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Here\u2019s your asshole trophy.", "Your mindset on excluding a stepson makes it really obvious why your daughter doesn\u2019t have a relationship with you.", "I think the whole premise of \"I'm going to pay so I can dictate the vacation\" is flawed at the outset. There's nothing wrong with picking a less affordable vacation so everyone who wants to go can go and no one has bad feelings.", "YTA for stepson", "Yta. \n\nI don't understand why you didn't invite your oldesr daughter or stepson. When you are inviting spouses of your other kids.", "NTA (although you are about the stepson unless maybe he was already an adult when they married) and I doubt they won\u2019t come if you put your foot down. Then they\u2019d have to explain it to their kids, which I doubt they are willing to go through.", "I\u2019m confused as to why the stepson wasn\u2019t included in this. Last I checked, a stepchild is considered a grandkid, no? Or do you know see yourself as a grandparent to this young adult? I really hope your oldest daughter rips you a new one. Such an AH thing to do", "YTA", "I don\u2019t think you are an A H for not including your DIL\u2019s nephew.\n\nI do think you are the A H for excluding a step child.

Maybe there is a reason the stepson wasn\u2019t invited. We don\u2019t even know how long OPs oldest child has been a step parent. Y\u2019all need to chill until there is more info.

Makes a huge difference here", "You should reorder it if you want them marked as YTA; my understanding is that the bots take the first vote (but I can be wrong!)", "They did invite the daughter, just not the stepson.", "Our daughter and her husband are invited and are coming. Her husband\u2019s son from his first marriage isn\u2019t coming. 3 of our 4 kids have stepfamilies and we had to exclude all of them for financial reasons and ability to find places (and 1 stepgrandson is getting married in May and wasn\u2019t  going to be able to make a vacation, a wedding and a honeymoon happen back to back to back anyway)", "[deleted]", "OP posted a comment that they\u2019ve also included multiple other step-children because it was \u201ctoo expensive\u201d.", "\"I'm paying for a vacation for all my kids and their kids, my grandkids. Well, except for my oldest daughter's stepson.\"  \n\n\nFuck that noise.   \n\n\nI had a step-grandparent whose doting on their \"first real\" grandchild caused significant mental trauma.

Grandparents in general don\u2019t have a say whether their kids have kids biological or otherwise. Grandparents can pick which grandkids they accept as family, but that makes them AH. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not a relation just because someone is in their life. It\u2019s a legal relationship via marriage. It\u2019s not like, \u201ca buddy\u201d or something.

Wonder why they drift in and out\u2026.why?", "Excluding people\u2019s family members just because they\u2019re not blood related makes YTA. A huge one as a matter of fact. If the price was too much to include ALL of your family, then you should\u2019ve gone just the two of you or picked a different location.", "This all depends on how long their daughter has been in stepsons life.
