We volunteered to pay for all lodging for everyone if they could pay for transportation and incidentals.  We invited everyone last July for an April vacation.  We wanted this to be a chance for our immediate family to be together and enjoy the experience and each other. We did not invite any friends or other relatives including my oldest daughter\u2019s (43 F) stepson (20M). This was a hard choice but we knew we had to make some determination otherwise we would be trying to find a place for my in-laws, and some of our friends and a lot of other people we love \n\nLast week my youngest daughter M (35F) and her wife (35F) told me that they had promised their nephew L( 10M) a tropical vacation that was canceled due to Covid. L is a nephew on my daughter-in-law\u2019s side and we have met him a few times, but he is not our relative and not someone any of the other kids or grandkids have a relationship with \n\nAfter my wife and I talked, we told M that we really want them there, but we want this to be \u201cour family\u201d and that we wouldn\u2019t feel right about adding L. L would have slept in the room with M\u2019s kids so there would have been no expense, just a child guest that nobody knows outside of M\u2019s family.\n\nWhen we told M that, M told us that she can\u2019t see taking this vacation without L, and that if we can\u2019t change our minds then they won\u2019t be joining us. \n\nTwo of our kids are saying we did the right thing, otherwise we open the trip up to whoever decides to join. One of our kids is saying we are TA because L would have fun with his cousins and wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden or a time burden on us. \n\nMy wife and I are struggling. We have already excluded people we are close to, when we sent the original invitation. And they had 7 months to bring up L and just told us this week. \n\nTo complicate things, M and her wife have been semi-estranged from us off and on. They tend to drift out of our lives for months at a time until they need something, then they stuck around for a little bit before drifting off again. So I really wanted this to be an experience that all of our kids and grandkids could share. Now my daughter, her wife, and their two sons, who we are least close to, will miss out. \n\nSo should we stick to our guns or are we TA and need to let them bring L?", "created_utc": 1673739677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10c4dm8/aita_for_excluding_my_daughter_from_a_trip_of_a/", "score": 2370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
