He could do no wrong in my parents eyes they would always bail him out of any situation. For example, he got in trouble with the law a lot as a teenager and in early 20\u2019s my parents would always bail him out more than once. He totaled his car and my parents just bought him another. He would steal my savings that I kept in my room and have no consequences. He\u2019s never had consequences to his actions from my parents. \nMy brother met his then wife through me. (No I didn\u2019t introduce them I told any female friends to stay away from my brother) They married when she was 18. They moved away shortly after due to his legal issues. They had two kids together. His ex would fly home to her mothers often to visit spend time here then go back to my brother. The last time she came she planned to stay about 6 months. At this point they\u2019d only been together about 4 years. Long story short she was cheating ended up pregnant. They divorced she got custody my brother was a mess afterwards. He eventually moved on. \nSo present day he\u2019s been with his new wife almost 8 year they have a kid now (7f). Recently I found out she moved out to her mothers essentially leaving my brother but still married they\u2019re \u201cworking\u201d on their differences. Yesterday he calls me frantically looking for our parents. They were both working. I ask him what wrong tell me how I can help. He tells me he has an emergency. I tell him to tell me what it is and I\u2019ll try to help. He asks me for money. I tell him no. He pleads and begs. I tell him if he tells me why he needs the money I\u2019ll let him borrow it. Long story short while his wife was at her mothers he\u2019s been cheating and now the mistress found out he\u2019s married and is now threatening to tell his wife. She\u2019s asking for money and he doesn\u2019t have it. My parents support him and his family there. Here\u2019s where I may have been the ahole I lose it on him. Asking him why he cheated. Asking him if his wife deserves the same pain he went through. Asking if he wants his child there to suffer like the ones here. He tells me I\u2019m making him feel bad he\u2019s going to cry. I tell him to grow the hell up. He\u2019s not young to be doing this. That he\u2019s a disappointment as an older brother. I tell him he deserves any pain and suffering he\u2019ll get for his actions. He begs me not to tell our mom. \nI tell my mom everything including what I told him. My mom tells me I was too harsh on him and he makes mistakes just like everyone else. She tells me if he gets divorced it\u2019ll me my fault again (I was blamed for \u201cintroducing the first wife) and I should help him because he\u2019s family. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision not to help him and feeling slightly guilty. \n\nSo Reddit AITA for telling my brother to grow the hell up instead of helping him?", "created_utc": 1668786455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyn7gc/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_grow_the_hell_up/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother got a good kick in the nuts from karma here. Why would you give your childish, irresponsible brother money to pay an extortionist?  That just sounds dumb. Your parents may be the biggest assholes in this whole family. Constantly covering for your brother, paying for his mistakes and letting him suffer no consequences has done your brother no favors in life. Trying to blame you for his first divorce just lets me know how far gone they are. Being family doesnt mean you let each other get away with murder. So tired of seeing that shit on here. Honestly I think you should go NC with your brother and let him know when he gets his life together and starts taking responsibility then yall can talk again.", "NTA and your family is toxic...", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents tell you it\u2019s your fault again apologize to them for not being a better parent to your brother as you were clearly the only one raising him.\n\nThey are always more than welcome to bail out their friend who is biologically their son.

I would be petty and tell his wife myself.", "NTA, but your parents and brother are.", "No NTA and don't second guess yourself! You can't fix his maladaptive behavior BUT you can have good boundaries and not support his shitty selfish behavior. Your parents are the reason he continues this shit at almost 40 years old...its sad and I'm sorry you had to grow up witnessing that.", "NTA - play stupid games, win stupid prizes. This is a problem that is entirely of his own making. I would recommend to him that he get a video or text msgs discussing this with her to try and get evidence of blackmail.", "YTA. **You can certainly deny him the money.** You can even ask him what the \"emergency\" is before you decide.  Remember: he called for your parents, he didn't ask for your help at all until you offered.\n\nUsing the call as an excuse to read his beads about his whole life is asshole behaviour. (Do you want your kids to suffer, you deserve any pain and suffering, you're a disappointment, does your wife deserve this pain, etc.). He honestly should have just cut you off immediately, there's no point to that discussion.\n\nYour mother is out of line for blaming you for anything wrong in your brother's life, so there's that.

I would just tell Mom- well, you forgive him for all his faults and mistakes, so if you think this one is on me, I guess you'll just have to forgive me.

It was a little callous to ask him what's wrong and how you could help when it sounds like you already entered the situation thinking he receives too much help, but overall you didn't do wrong.
