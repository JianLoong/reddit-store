He could do no wrong in my parents eyes they would always bail him out of any situation. For example, he got in trouble with the law a lot as a teenager and in early 20\u2019s my parents would always bail him out more than once. He totaled his car and my parents just bought him another. He would steal my savings that I kept in my room and have no consequences. He\u2019s never had consequences to his actions from my parents. \nMy brother met his then wife through me. (No I didn\u2019t introduce them I told any female friends to stay away from my brother) They married when she was 18. They moved away shortly after due to his legal issues. They had two kids together. His ex would fly home to her mothers often to visit spend time here then go back to my brother. The last time she came she planned to stay about 6 months. At this point they\u2019d only been together about 4 years. Long story short she was cheating ended up pregnant. They divorced she got custody my brother was a mess afterwards. He eventually moved on. \nSo present day he\u2019s been with his new wife almost 8 year they have a kid now (7f). Recently I found out she moved out to her mothers essentially leaving my brother but still married they\u2019re \u201cworking\u201d on their differences. Yesterday he calls me frantically looking for our parents. They were both working. I ask him what wrong tell me how I can help. He tells me he has an emergency. I tell him to tell me what it is and I\u2019ll try to help. He asks me for money. I tell him no. He pleads and begs. I tell him if he tells me why he needs the money I\u2019ll let him borrow it. Long story short while his wife was at her mothers he\u2019s been cheating and now the mistress found out he\u2019s married and is now threatening to tell his wife. She\u2019s asking for money and he doesn\u2019t have it. My parents support him and his family there. Here\u2019s where I may have been the ahole I lose it on him. Asking him why he cheated. Asking him if his wife deserves the same pain he went through. Asking if he wants his child there to suffer like the ones here. He tells me I\u2019m making him feel bad he\u2019s going to cry. I tell him to grow the hell up. He\u2019s not young to be doing this. That he\u2019s a disappointment as an older brother. I tell him he deserves any pain and suffering he\u2019ll get for his actions. He begs me not to tell our mom. \nI tell my mom everything including what I told him. My mom tells me I was too harsh on him and he makes mistakes just like everyone else. She tells me if he gets divorced it\u2019ll me my fault again (I was blamed for \u201cintroducing the first wife) and I should help him because he\u2019s family. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision not to help him and feeling slightly guilty. \n\nSo Reddit AITA for telling my brother to grow the hell up instead of helping him?", "created_utc": 1668786455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyn7gc/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_grow_the_hell_up/", "score": 324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
