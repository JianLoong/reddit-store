She is just refusing to take it because it makes her feel \"shameful\". All things considered, your parents' house is currently the best option.", "She feels shame about moving into her parents' huge house but no shame about potentially sharing a single bed in a 190 square-foot one-room apartment that is her sister's dorm, study space, and office?  And she has no job, so she expects a student to support her.  This is incredibly shameful, utterly clueless, and stunningly impractical.  I'm starting to see why she hasn't been hired.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have room for her, period. It will be much more detrimental to you for her to move in (disrupting your work and life) than it would be detrimental to her to move back in with your parents (just making her feel ashamed about something that happens to lots of people)", "NTA. I used to live in just a slightly bigger, 20 sqm apartment, too. Now, I was extreamly close to my twin sister, so I let her come and live with me but: 1. I was used to small spaces 2. She's my twin 3. She had no other choice but me. \n\nYour sister has a way better option if she could just swallow a meaningless pride. So many ppl nowadays can't afford a place of their own. There's no shame in asking help from parents, that's what family is for.", "NTA you're both adults.\nSis can pay for her own studio and then get to decide who can live there and for how long.\nNo money, but ample space at parents' house?

Additionally, it is completely impractical given the amount of space you have.", "NTA she can choose to get over it and decide to remain butthurt over this. Bottom line is, it is her choice.", "NTA!

In most cultures/countries there\u2019s no shame about living with your parents and intergenerational households are the norm. Helping each other through life is seen as a good thing not a failure. I\u2019m always shocked by these posts where family members are charging each other or their children \u201crent\u201d (in a very transactional way as opposed to everyone contributing what they can and according to need). So I do not blame your sister for feeling shame because it\u2019s part of the hyperindividualist neoliberal culture but she does need to get over it since she\u2019s fortunate to have options.

Actually those living arrangements are taking a beating because a lot of young women are opting out, and the Son's aren't going to do the housework. My Wife is froends with a bunch of young Chinese Women. They are professionals and have their own money and don't seem to want to marry at all. They are definitely not marrying some only son so they can take care of his parents.", "Who wants to move in with your parents if it's going to cause more mental stress on you? It's not OP's sisters fault she doesn't want to move back in with their parents. I've met lots of people who don't want to do that because they enjoy their independence. I moved in with my parents for around 1.5 years in my 20's after being independent since I was 12yo (boarding school+college in a country far far away from my parents) and I hated that I couldn't live the way that I wanted and my parents demanded to spend time with me when all I wanted to do was decompress after work alone in my room.", "He probably also doesn't know Asian girls don't really want to live with our parents because we love our freedom/s!!\n\nMy 37yo sister lives with my parents and he still does the dad-sigh if she's not home by 10pm. I mean she managed to survive living in two different European countries alone when she was completing her Masters!!\n\nSeriously though, who wants to move back in with their parents if it's going to cause more mental stress?", "Im an american and I feel hurt for you", "exactly!! the comment sounded like every other culture other than white americans/ europeans LOVE living with their parents as an adult lol haha", "Because sometimes they don't have a choice. Or they have a different dynamic and get along with their parents. Some people take in their family to look after them. I definitely get along better with my mom ever since I moved away, so I get you, but different homes different situations.", "I bet he's male. If you ask any female to be honest, no one wants to live in the same house as the in-laws. Same compound maybe but never in the same house.", "I get that but the redittor who made the comment way above sure doesn't. Also there are too many post on reddit about regrets moving back in or taking in family."]}
