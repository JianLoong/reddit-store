She is just refusing to take it because it makes her feel \"shameful\". All things considered, your parents' house is currently the best option.", "She feels shame about moving into her parents' huge house but no shame about potentially sharing a single bed in a 190 square-foot one-room apartment that is her sister's dorm, study space, and office?  And she has no job, so she expects a student to support her.  This is incredibly shameful, utterly clueless, and stunningly impractical.  I'm starting to see why she hasn't been hired.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have room for her, period. It will be much more detrimental to you for her to move in (disrupting your work and life) than it would be detrimental to her to move back in with your parents (just making her feel ashamed about something that happens to lots of people)", "NTA. I used to live in just a slightly bigger, 20 sqm apartment, too. Now, I was extreamly close to my twin sister, so I let her come and live with me but: 1. I was used to small spaces 2. She's my twin 3. She had no other choice but me. \n\nYour sister has a way better option if she could just swallow a meaningless pride. So many ppl nowadays can't afford a place of their own. There's no shame in asking help from parents, that's what family is for.", "NTA you're both adults.\nSis can pay for her own studio and then get to decide who can live there and for how long.\nNo money, but ample space at parents' house? Well beggars can't be choosers.", "NTA. Her embarrassment does not entitle her to live in your space. Additionally, it is completely impractical given the amount of space you have.", "NTA she can choose to get over it and decide to remain butthurt over this. Bottom line is, it is her choice.", "NTA! There is simply not enough space.

This is a completely unreasonable request.", "nta", "I\u2019d bet money these are white Americans/Europeans (though more likely Americans). In most cultures/countries there\u2019s no shame about living with your parents and intergenerational households are the norm. Helping each other through life is seen as a good thing not a failure. I\u2019m always shocked by these posts where family members are charging each other or their children \u201crent\u201d (in a very transactional way as opposed to everyone contributing what they can and according to need). So I do not blame your sister for feeling shame because it\u2019s part of the hyperindividualist neoliberal culture but she does need to get over it since she\u2019s fortunate to have options.

Actually those living arrangements are taking a beating because a lot of young women are opting out, and the Son's aren't going to do the housework. My Wife is froends with a bunch of young Chinese Women. They are professionals and have their own money and don't seem to want to marry at all. They are definitely not marrying some only son so they can take care of his parents.", "Who wants to move in with your parents if it's going to cause more mental stress on you? It's not OP's sisters fault she doesn't want to move back in with their parents. I've met lots of people who don't want to do that because they enjoy their independence. I moved in with my parents for around 1.5 years in my 20's after being independent since I was 12yo (boarding school+college in a country far far away from my parents) and I hated that I couldn't live the way that I wanted and my parents demanded to spend time with me when all I wanted to do was decompress after work alone in my room.", "He probably also doesn't know Asian girls don't really want to live with our parents because we love our freedom/s!!\n\nMy 37yo sister lives with my parents and he still does the dad-sigh if she's not home by 10pm. I mean she managed to survive living in two different European countries alone when she was completing her Masters!!\n\nSeriously though, who wants to move back in with their parents if it's going to cause more mental stress?", "Im an american and I feel hurt for you", "exactly!! the comment sounded like every other culture other than white americans/ europeans LOVE living with their parents as an adult lol haha", "Because sometimes they don't have a choice. Or they have a different dynamic and get along with their parents. Some people take in their family to look after them. I definitely get along better with my mom ever since I moved away, so I get you, but different homes different situations.", "I bet he's male. If you ask any female to be honest, no one wants to live in the same house as the in-laws. Same compound maybe but never in the same house.", "I get that but the redittor who made the comment way above sure doesn't. Also there are too many post on reddit about regrets moving back in or taking in family.", "NTA. You're a student in a studio apartment. Your sister's request is not practical.", "NTA you don't *really* even have space for yourself!", "No. Just no.  There's barely room for you.

That could put you at risk for being kicked from housing too, or even worse. She has a place to go, she can't stay with you, end of discussion.", "NTA you simply don\u2019t have room, I need your space and your quiet to work. She\u2019s just gonna have to get over it and move back home for a while, there is a housing crisis everywhere, she is certainly not the only one in that position.", "NTA. You do not have the space and there is probably something in your lease about only 1 person living there. Sister needs to figure something out or suck it up and move back in with parents. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. A lot of people in their 20s still live at home.", "Nah. She asked and you declined because you can't. Nothing wrong with that", "NTA!!! You don't have enough space to host a cat much less a full human sister who is going to have thoughts and feelings and opinions.", "Don't let her visit even just for a few days. She won't leave. Also you could get in trouble with your landlord if more than one person is living there. NTA", "If this is student housing as your title implies, she would not be allowed to move in with you. Even a regular apartment often has rules in the lease about how long a guest can stay. Violating the housing/leasing rules will cause you to lose your place. Even if this does not apply, you can still use the information to smooth things over with your sister. It creates the idea that it's not that you don't want to live with your sister, but instead, you are prohibited by your lease. NTA. If you don't want to give your sister an excuse, No is a complete sentence.", "NTA She needs to suck it up and accept help from the people who are equipped to give it.", "NTA. Small quarters create pressure.Pressure leads to flare ups. 200 square feet isn\u2019t enough.", "NTA  \n\n\nSpace is irrleivant. You don't want her there and that's your right.", "NTA.  You don't have the space and you also don't know how your landlord would have reacted to her moving in.  Your landlord might have evicted you because you let her move in.", "Exactly, she will come and never leave.", "OP barely has room for her period.", "Most of the time intergenerational households suck. I lived in one as a kid and it was horrendous. Stop portraying it as it's such a good thing when it's not. \n\nMy mother in law also fought hard to escape such a household. Her own mother in law disrespected her, tried to turn her husband against her, made her feel like she wasn't welcomed there. \n\nIt might work for a very small percentage of people, but let's not pretend that it works for everyone.", "White people help each other. It\u2019s extremely common to have a grandparent living with family members when they can no longer afford or handle caring for themselves. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to be independent. My grandmother lived alone for 25 years after my grandfather died (he died at 54).  She loved her independence and her own space. She reluctantly moved in my aunt for the last 15 years of her life when her house became too much to maintain.  \n\nThe vast majority of parents do not charge their kids rent.  The few friends I had that were charged rent, were given their rent back as starter money for their own place when they moved out. I don\u2019t see that as a bad thing. It teaches them responsibility for their own living situation, and gives them a realistic expectation for what they can afford when they do move out.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that everyone would like their own space to have privacy and do their own thing, and that living in huge multigenerational homes is born out of necessity rather than desire (for most people).   That being said, just because many white people want their own space does not mean they value their families any less or help any less than cultures where people are living in the same house. \n\nYou sound pretty racist tbh.", "I\u2019m American. The derisive snottiness of your post is ridiculous. You could engage in a discussion with people instead of lumping everyone into the same category.", "I\u2019m an American mom and I don\u2019t get it either. People ask me constantly if I charge my kids (23 and 20) rent. Wtf, no, I created these two humans and it\u2019s my job/joy to help them out while they figure out who they are and build their lives.\n\nYour blanket cultural claims are weird though.", "Angry and hurt much? Who hurt you??? Was it mommy? I bet it was Mommy. I mean, cool. If you want to be 40 years old living with mommy and daddy, that's on you. If you're cool sharing a studio apartment that is less than 200sq ft and ruining your own mental health, that's on you. But chill with the ignorant, bigoted, and hateful comments. If you're not in Europe or the United States (which I assume is what you mean by American), don't come to live or visit. If you're in Europe or the United States, leave.", "...Tell me you've never lived in a bedsit with another human being for more than 24 hours without saying so.", "Uhh, not even the same compound. I\u2019m a good 20-30 mins away from my in laws and I still think I\u2019m too close to them."]}
