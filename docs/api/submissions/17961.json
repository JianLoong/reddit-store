In most cultures/countries there\u2019s no shame about living with your parents and intergenerational households are the norm. Helping each other through life is seen as a good thing not a failure. I\u2019m always shocked by these posts where family members are charging each other or their children \u201crent\u201d (in a very transactional way as opposed to everyone contributing what they can and according to need). So I do not blame your sister for feeling shame because it\u2019s part of the hyperindividualist neoliberal culture but she does need to get over it since she\u2019s fortunate to have options.

I\u2019m not saying people have to live in intergenerational households nor that all intergenerational households are perfect, any more than all nuclear families are perfect. What I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s no shame in it in MOST places. In North America there tends to be an idea that if you\u2019re not independent and living on your own at a very young age you\u2019ve somehow failed. That\u2019s a very corrosive idea and it\u2019s clear that this is affecting OP\u2019s sister who would feel shame about living into her parent\u2019s spacious 4-bedroom house to such an extent that she wants to cram herself into OP\u2019s dorm room.

I moved in with my parents for around 1.5 years in my 20's after being independent since I was 12yo (boarding school+college in a country far far away from my parents) and I hated that I couldn't live the way that I wanted and my parents demanded to spend time with me when all I wanted to do was decompress after work alone in my room.", "He probably also doesn't know Asian girls don't really want to live with our parents because we love our freedom/s!!\n\nMy 37yo sister lives with my parents and my dad still does the dad-sigh if she's not home by 10pm.

The few friends I had that were charged rent, were given their rent back as starter money for their own place when they moved out. I don\u2019t see that as a bad thing. It teaches them responsibility for their own living situation, and gives them a realistic expectation for what they can afford when they do move out.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that everyone would like their own space to have privacy and do their own thing, and that living in huge multigenerational homes is born out of necessity rather than desire (for most people).   That being said, just because many white people want their own space does not mean they value their families any less or help any less than cultures where people are living in the same house. \n\nYou sound pretty racist tbh.", "I\u2019m American.
