He is a lawyer with a small law firm earning more than I did working. He had been covering the rent while I pay for anything our son needs, anything I need, about half of the groceries, as well as doing the lion\u2019s share of the cooking, cleaning and childcare.\nHe came to me this morning demanding I pay \u00ab\u00a0my half of the rent\u00a0\u00bb but I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair in our situation. I am planning to go back to work in January and we would then split the rent, household and childcare accordingly.

You've been married for 8 years, why are you still acting like a couple of students sharing a house instead of a team with a shared child and (presumably) plans to spend your future together?", "ESH. Why on earth are you two dividing your finances like this? \n\nWhen the chance arises, is he going to throw that he pays full rent in your face? When you disagree about how to raise the child, are you going to throw the fact that you pay for everything baby related in his face? Because that is the kind of behaviour your current arrangement incentivises you both towards.", "ESH. Your husband is an asshole, for sure. What kind of man demands money from his wife and the mother of his child? Then again, you are thinking exactly the same way he does - his and your half, what's monetary fair and what is not. You've been together for 8 years and have a child, you should not even think in the terms of separate finances. You should be a team.", "ESH\n\nI have to admit, I really don't understand completely separate finances when people are married. (A separate account for each person for fun money, sure, but not entirely separate finances.)\n\nHowever, as you do have separate finances, you should be contributing to rent. It should be proportional. If he makes 100k and you made 75k before and 40k now (just making up numbers), then you should have paid about 40% of the rent before and should pay between 25 and 30% of the rent now. If you were a stay at home mom, you'd make 0, so proportionately wouldn't pay rent, but that's not the case here.\n\nI feel you are TA for wanting to keep all your money despite being in a split financial situation, and he is an AH for wanting you to pay half when you are making substantially less than he is.\n\nWhy can't you just talk and reach a compromise?", "YTA - are you two a combined, married unit or are you just two people who had a kid and live together?\n\nHe is obviously asking you for rent because he doesn't have enough money and is financially stressed. You admit yourself you're \"bad with money\" yet you just... you just don't have a team mindset here\n\nthis whole post just gives me the icks\n\ngood luck with your life", "You should divide expenses so that each of you increases their savings by the same amount each year.

You are in an unbalanced relationship with someone who groomed younger teens while he was in his 20s. Now he is trying to keep the relationship off balance by taking control of you financially.  I suggest therapy and financial counciling.  Some day you may need out, so build the tools you will need now.\n\nNo, as the SAHP you should be supported financially or at least your contribution to the finances should be based on your reduced income as well as the sacrifices you are making to stay home and do the majority of parenting", "NTA and he is. He gets all the perks of having a wife and mother to his child, AND gets to coomandeer your money. Why are you paying for all the babys needs? Isnt it his child too? \nSmall piece of advice: this is not \"happuly married\", you are being  abused. Go to couples therapy, try and work it out, and if it doesnt work out, so be it .", "NTA, you're on reduced money while looking after his child, why does he think only you should suffer financially when you both are parents now?", "ESH It sounds as though you need to sit down together and discuss how you are going to manage your finances moving forward - you earn different amounts, you now have a son who has needs and financial requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are still getting 60% of your normal pay - how does that amount compare with your husband's salary? It might make more sense to look at an arrangements where you pay according to your respective incomes so (for instance) if he was earning E2,000 a month and you were earning E1,000, it might make sense for him to pay 2/3 of the rent and bills (including those for your child) and you 1/3 .\n\nOr for you to both pay your full salary into a joint account, pay all the outgoings from that, and maybe have a set amount transferred back to your sole accounts for personal spending each, so you both have some 'fun money\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt present, if you pay nothing to the rent, how much do each of you have after the rent, bills, food and essentials for your son are all covered? If you have more at that point hen it sounds like you should be paying something to the rent, even if it's less than 50%. If he still has more at that point, it's more reasonable for you to keep what you have and for him to continue to cover the rent", "Nta and he's red flags", "As the other commenters say, there is a good way to avoid this fight.\n\nGet a joint account and put everything you both earn there. Everything you spend, rent, groceries, the baby's things etc is taken off this account. Then you both get monthly \"allowances\", generous ones if you can, to buy your own fun stuff.\n\nProblem solved.", "NTA. He's out earning you and you're still paying part of the bills while caring for your child and taking care of the house. He's got all the benefits of a sahm right now but expects the joint income of a working mom. He's your husband not your roomie and needs to realize what your contribution is rather than grabbing for rent money on top of all the other things you're doing right now.", "You have a child together but you do not have a common account for money ? Why ? You live together and are married, wouldn't that be much more simple ?   \nAnd if he thinks that you are bad with money, he could then see where you spend too much and give you advice on what to do to prevent bad spendings", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
