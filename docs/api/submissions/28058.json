It should be proportional.

You make a lot less than half the income and are taking on the full financial burden of your child as well as the majority of the household burden, while recovering from a major medical event. It's wild to expect you to pay half the rent.

These comments are UNREAL.", "NTA. He's a lawyer, he should know child support in Germany doesn't fuck around and will put a far bigger dent in his finances than paying all the rent. It's a percentage of income, so good luck getting a good deal when you're making a lawyer's salary and the mother has a nurse's salary. Literally unheard of.

Your new share of the rent should have been agreed upon before your leave started.

Normally the stay at home parent picks up more of the household chores because they aren\u2019t contributing financially.", "Serious creepy vibes from that alone.", "So you're saying that because OP's husband expects OP to pay rent, that OP ought to divorce the husband and royally screw over his life?", "He wants her to pay half the rent when she's  making less than 60% of what he is and she's also solely paying for all of their child's needs and doing most of the childcare and housework... But you think *she* doesn't have a team mindset?", "If the husband wasn't royally screwing her over now she wouldn't need to divorce", "Lolno, where'd you get that idea? If anything, I said she should take what she's owed and what he's obligated to provide. Having legal obligations isn't having your life screwed with by someone else. It's past you screwing over present and future you. You accepted the obligation to care for a child when you helped conceive it. Why should my taxes pay for his actions, when he has income to spare to raise the child? They obviously shouldn't, that should come out of his income. And if that's high, the child got lucky and gets to go to private school. Just wait until you find out it's also going to inherit everything unless he has other children or draws up a will.\n\nAs a lawyer, it's literally his job to know and understand all of this. Instead, he's paying pattycakes over a few hundred bucks of what should be their common household funds. The only reason why he could ever want those funds separate is because he's considering divorce himself. And if that's not the case, the guy is just ruining his marriage unpromptedly.\n\nIn both cases, how is she not better off without the guy that's either looking for an exit or a complete tool with no consideration for his partner?", "She probably is better off without the guy. But that doesn't change the fact that your advice for OP is to divorce the guy, label him a deadbeat, and put his career at risk. All over him asking her to contribute to rent while she's still making an income. \n\nImo the correct way for all this to be handled is that OP has 60% her normal income, and that means she contributes 60% of what she normally would. If her portion of rent is 1000 euros, she pays 600.  That said, the husband also needs to contribute equally or roughly equally to chores.\n\nI agree the husband is a tool. I just found the suggestion of divorce to be over the top. There's nothing in the post that suggests the husband is preparing to divorce her either."]}
