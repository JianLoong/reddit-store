Today I was bit again this time resulting in an urgent care visit that sent me to the ER all day due to nerve damage. I have several puncture wounds on both hands, wrist and one forearm. \n\nPrior to this I have expressed my concerns with the dogs constant barking disrupting my work from home, and his having accidents all over the house that we just remodeled. Those were annoyances, but things that we could have worked around. The aggression on the other hand is a real issue for me. I\u2019m scared of the dog now and our work schedules place me around the dog alone often.\n\nI have said that I am no longer comfortable living with the dog and my fianc\u00e9 is acting like I am lacking compassion for the dog and unwilling to find a compromise such as training. My school of thought is that training isn\u2019t a 100% guarantee and if we did that I would be living on eggshells just wondering when the next attack would be. He\u2019s a GSD so very capable of doing serious harm. I grew up with GSDs and love the breed but no longer feel safe around him. My fianc\u00e9 is saying I am asking him to give away a family member but all I want is to feel safe and secure in my own home. I feel like he is asking me to be repeatedly put in harms way.

You could start with simply refusing any and all contact with the dog, which is logical because you are literally being attacked. He will have to figure out how to feed the dog and get it outside for bathroom. He cleans all messes. But that is so basic it's almost painful, and he's likely going to complain about it. So yeah, this step isn't good enough. Frankly he is putting the dog's aggressive behavior above your life. The dog is more important than you. I'm so sorry, but that is what he showing you. You are at a point where asking him to rehome or get training or else you leave - STILL ISNT ENOUGH. I hate saying this to random people, but you just need to leave. Pack up some things, stay with a friend or family member. When (if??) he asks, you are tired of being attacked and going to the hospital. He seems to value an aggressive animal so much, then he can have it. \n\nIf he had a brother staying with you who smacked you around for doing normal house stuff and then breaking your arm for cooking dinner, how should he react??

This particular dog is aggressive and while there may be ways to address this, it is also not okay for you to have to live in a home where you do not feel safe.  \n\nI had a huge mongrel dog whom I raised from puppyhood and with age he became irritable and aggressive. He came to bite everyone in the family (and I live in a family compound with eight people.  He bit every one of us). We tried our best because we loved this dog, but one day when we had guests, he was put in the back yard (we have a fenced in part of the back yard with space to walk around, grass, food and water). When I let him out (it was about 3 hours later), he attacked me, biting all over my arms. My father and brother came to help and were attacked too. He was too dangerous, we had to have him put down. We had children in the house! And to this day, I have a phobia of large dogs. I can now only be around small dogs. And to think I raised this dog from the time he was newborn!  I wish there was a way for us to have helped our dog with his aggression, but there is a point when the safety of family and children cannot be risked. \n\nYou may very nearly be there.

I believe that pets are family, but an aggressive German Shepard is an extremely dangerous dog. I'd be shocked if you could rehome him. The two bites are within a month if each other.

Regardless, you are not safe with that dog in your home. The dog will sense your unease and fear, possibly triggering another attack. I also think you will resent your fiance for not prioritizing your safety over a dog that has really hurt you and 99% will again. I couldn't imagine feeling comfortable rehoming a dog with that level of aggression. Next time, what if it's a child, what if he overpowers ___ and kills them, or another dog??? He is a liability.

Getting rid of the dog without even trying to resolve the issue with training is not unreasonable given that you have been seriously injured but neither you nor your fianc\u00e9 have bothered to nip this problem in the bud with training at the first signs of anxiety (like the accidents) or aggression.\n\nIf you had started earlier you could probably have averted this problem altogether - and you shouldn\u2019t own a dog if you can\u2019t spot the early warning signs of discomfort in the dog and either address them yourselves or know when to ask for professional help. Rehoming an aggressive dog with a history of biting at home isn\u2019t easy so you\u2019re almost asking to have him put down.\n\nIf you just remodelled the home it\u2019s likely that there have been a lot of unfamiliar smells/sights/people in the house and that could be what started this off, and with training and time it could settle down - but whatever triggered the aggression if you\u2019ve been around GSDs all your life you should be aware of when to take yourself out of the room/give the dog some space, and you and your fianc\u00e9 should be working together to prevent the dog getting dangerous, regardless of who the owner is. If you can\u2019t manage to do that then you aren\u2019t ready to live together.\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 are both turning this into a power struggle between the two of you instead of working together to resolve the issue and protect the dog from becoming dangerous and getting destroyed.", "Training can work, but it takes commitment from both owners.

Bites like that may have the dog on the dangerous dogs list but more than likely PTS. \n\nIm a huge advocate for dogs and also say that at least the dog should see a vet to rule out medical issues and see a trainer. However, you can not be involved in this. Honestly, there is no going back for you now. You can not stay in the house with this dog. Even with the training, you will always have that fear of him and no trust (which is fair), and the dog will pick up on that. \n\nIt's interesting that you said in the last 6 months that the aggression has upped a notch. Has fiance taken the dog to the vet? Has the dog been seen by a vet behaviourist? Has he got a trainer? Has your fiance done any of those things? Has your fiance done anything since the food aggression started?  If he hasn't done anything and this has been going on for some time, and you keep getting injured, then you have a fiance problem too. Your fiance should not be owning a dog at all, and he should be protecting you.\n\nThe dog can not be rehomed in good conscience, giving the severity of the bites, even with a family member, its extremely risky. If he was to go to a shelter or pound, he would not be rehomed because of this. He would be PTS.

You have been brutally attacked, and your fiance is doing nothing to ensure your safety. Sure, he wants to do training now, but it's too little too late. You can not be around that dog  during his rehabilitation. Given how your fiance has approached the situation, i do not have high hopes that rehabilitation will even work. If you put the dog to sleep or manage to rehome him, then your fiance will resent you. It may even be the end of your relationship. In my opinion, that's okay as your life is more important\n\nOut of curiosity, why do you keep getting attacked? I'd figure if the dog is food aggressive, your fiance would be feeding him. Was all the instances you were attacked regarding the dogs' food? Are you the one feeding him? Is he aggressive around food you or your partner are eating?

You said the dog had training before but the issue now is different & more serious. There seems to have been a few different changes for the dog that could be contributing to his behavior. But rehoming the dog now wouldn\u2019t be safe for the new family. You need to sit your fianc\u00e9 down & say what isn\u2019t negotiable to you regarding the dog if he wants to keep him: serious training, being in a crate when you\u2019re home alone with it (or outside if possible), & whatever else makes you feel safe.

There is ALWAYS a reason for any behavior in dogs. If the dog is showing agressive behaviors towards the food theres a reason for it. This is not an uncommon behavior and it's completely treatable.

He has a 4 year old German shepherd that as of the last 6 months or so has shown increased aggression around his food. 3 weeks ago I was bit which resulted in a puncture wound and severe bruising. Today I was bit again this time resulting in an urgent care visit that sent me to the ER all day due to nerve damage. I have several puncture wounds on both hands, wrist and one forearm. \n\nPrior to this I have expressed my concerns with the dogs constant barking disrupting my work from home, and his having accidents all over the house that we just remodeled. Those were annoyances, but things that we could have worked around. The aggression on the other hand is a real issue for me. I\u2019m scared of the dog now and our work schedules place me around the dog alone often.\n\nI have said that I am no longer comfortable living with the dog and my fianc\u00e9 is acting like I am lacking compassion for the dog and unwilling to find a compromise such as training. My school of thought is that training isn\u2019t a 100% guarantee and if we did that I would be living on eggshells just wondering when the next attack would be. He\u2019s a GSD so very capable of doing serious harm. I grew up with GSDs and love the breed but no longer feel safe around him. My fianc\u00e9 is saying I am asking him to give away a family member but all I want is to feel safe and secure in my own home. I feel like he is asking me to be repeatedly put in harms way.

You mentioned training isn't a 100% guarantee and you're right it can be a hit or miss! Would a compromise be possible where the dog stays with family he knows AND gets training? this way you don't have to be around the dog and he's still gonna get training to see if it works for him? My thinking with this suggestion is that it gives you a sense of peace in your home and the dog can potentially come back with you two IF 1. you feel safe to do that and 2. the training works ! The worst outcome with his is just that he stays with a family member or friend in which case your fiance can still visit his dog and won't be completely separated from him?", "I immediately assumed I was going to be going for AH, but so NTA.

My recommendation would be that bf either needs to be willing to put in some pretty strict and intensive training, possibly even hiring a trainer to come to the house to work with him and the dog, or rehome the dog to a person who has the time and experience, and probably no other dogs. My thought is that his resource guarding is getting worse because of too many changes in his life, and he might not be as ok as he seems with your other dog or you.\n\n\nMost importantly, though, is that you do not feel safe working with or around this dog. So bf needs to take over all feeding duties immediately at the very least. A shut door between the dog and you whenever food is present. Also, having a can of citronella spray on hand might not be a bad idea for your safety.\n\n\nI think this behavior can be changed since it's pretty predictable, but not if it puts you in harm's way. Without serious commitment, rehoming is probably best.", "I also will add that I work in an environment 3x week  where I am unable to enter my lab with an open wound from elbow down. So it\u2019s not just the injury itself it\u2019s also affecting my work.", "I feel like you haven't read a single line of what I wrote.\n\nA dog is like a child. They are dependant on you, just like a son or a daughter would.\n\nWhen things get messy, you don't just throw them out. Like you said : you try to fix it yourself. When it doesn't work, you get people involved and get counselling. If that doesn't work, you send them to a place where they can get the help they need. That works for children AND for dogs.\n\nAnd then when the work is done... you take your child back. You never stop seing them. You are with them every step of the way. \n\nIf your son becomes too much, you let him do as he pleases until he gets too far... would you just dump him to another family so someone else can \"give him the life he needs\" ?! Of course not. Why would you do that with a pet ?!", "Have they? Yes they have. Your anecdotal evidence  based on a friend of a friend, doesn\u2019t make compelling objective evidence.\n\nI find it odd that you would make claims about something without being knowledgeable about the topic.", "Extremely important info. The dog has caused serious bodily injury and effected your livelihood. Why does your husband want to keep it at this point?", "Haha. It's not a friend of a friend. I said it was a couple of friends, as in people I'm close to and talk to on a regular basis and seeing firsthand the differencein the before and after of the dogs. I was speaking from what I've heard and seen for myself, not from statistics.\n\nI also didn't make claims about anything, it was just a suggestion for an avenue that might be considered.", "Does it seem wise making suggestions about a situation involving a dangerous dog by pulling ideas out of the air that you have no personal knowledge or evidence about?"]}
