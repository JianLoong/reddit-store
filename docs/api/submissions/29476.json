Today I was bit again this time resulting in an urgent care visit that sent me to the ER all day due to nerve damage. I have several puncture wounds on both hands, wrist and one forearm. \n\nPrior to this I have expressed my concerns with the dogs constant barking disrupting my work from home, and his having accidents all over the house that we just remodeled. Those were annoyances, but things that we could have worked around. The aggression on the other hand is a real issue for me. I\u2019m scared of the dog now and our work schedules place me around the dog alone often.\n\nI have said that I am no longer comfortable living with the dog and my fianc\u00e9 is acting like I am lacking compassion for the dog and unwilling to find a compromise such as training. My school of thought is that training isn\u2019t a 100% guarantee and if we did that I would be living on eggshells just wondering when the next attack would be. He\u2019s a GSD so very capable of doing serious harm. I grew up with GSDs and love the breed but no longer feel safe around him. My fianc\u00e9 is saying I am asking him to give away a family member but all I want is to feel safe and secure in my own home. I feel like he is asking me to be repeatedly put in harms way.

You could start with simply refusing any and all contact with the dog, which is logical because you are literally being attacked. He will have to figure out how to feed the dog and get it outside for bathroom. He cleans all messes. But that is so basic it's almost painful, and he's likely going to complain about it. So yeah, this step isn't good enough. Frankly he is putting the dog's aggressive behavior above your life. The dog is more important than you. I'm so sorry, but that is what he showing you. You are at a point where asking him to rehome or get training or else you leave - STILL ISNT ENOUGH. I hate saying this to random people, but you just need to leave. Pack up some things, stay with a friend or family member. When (if??) he asks, you are tired of being attacked and going to the hospital. He seems to value an aggressive animal so much, then he can have it. \n\nIf he had a brother staying with you who smacked you around for doing normal house stuff and then breaking your arm for cooking dinner, how should he react??

This particular dog is aggressive and while there may be ways to address this, it is also not okay for you to have to live in a home where you do not feel safe.  \n\nI had a huge mongrel dog whom I raised from puppyhood and with age he became irritable and aggressive. He came to bite everyone in the family (and I live in a family compound with eight people.  He bit every one of us). We tried our best because we loved this dog, but one day when we had guests, he was put in the back yard (we have a fenced in part of the back yard with space to walk around, grass, food and water). When I let him out (it was about 3 hours later), he attacked me, biting all over my arms. My father and brother came to help and were attacked too. He was too dangerous, we had to have him put down. We had children in the house! And to this day, I have a phobia of large dogs. I can now only be around small dogs. And to think I raised this dog from the time he was newborn!  I wish there was a way for us to have helped our dog with his aggression, but there is a point when the safety of family and children cannot be risked. \n\nYou may very nearly be there.

I believe that pets are family, but an aggressive German Shepard is an extremely dangerous dog. I'd be shocked if you could rehome him. The two bites are within a month if each other.

Regardless, you are not safe with that dog in your home. The dog will sense your unease and fear, possibly triggering another attack. I also think you will resent your fiance for not prioritizing your safety over a dog that has really hurt you and 99% will again. I couldn't imagine feeling comfortable rehoming a dog with that level of aggression. Next time, what if it's a child, what if he overpowers ___ and kills them, or another dog??? He is a liability.

Getting rid of the dog without even trying to resolve the issue with training is not unreasonable given that you have been seriously injured but neither you nor your fianc\u00e9 have bothered to nip this problem in the bud with training at the first signs of anxiety (like the accidents) or aggression.\n\nIf you had started earlier you could probably have averted this problem altogether - and you shouldn\u2019t own a dog if you can\u2019t spot the early warning signs of discomfort in the dog and either address them yourselves or know when to ask for professional help. Rehoming an aggressive dog with a history of biting at home isn\u2019t easy so you\u2019re almost asking to have him put down.\n\nIf you just remodelled the home it\u2019s likely that there have been a lot of unfamiliar smells/sights/people in the house and that could be what started this off, and with training and time it could settle down - but whatever triggered the aggression if you\u2019ve been around GSDs all your life you should be aware of when to take yourself out of the room/give the dog some space, and you and your fianc\u00e9 should be working together to prevent the dog getting dangerous, regardless of who the owner is. If you can\u2019t manage to do that then you aren\u2019t ready to live together.\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 are both turning this into a power struggle between the two of you instead of working together to resolve the issue and protect the dog from becoming dangerous and getting destroyed.", "Training can work, but it takes commitment from both owners.

Bites like that may have the dog on the dangerous dogs list but more than likely PTS. \n\nIm a huge advocate for dogs and also say that at least the dog should see a vet to rule out medical issues and see a trainer. However, you can not be involved in this. Honestly, there is no going back for you now. You can not stay in the house with this dog. Even with the training, you will always have that fear of him and no trust (which is fair), and the dog will pick up on that. \n\nIt's interesting that you said in the last 6 months that the aggression has upped a notch. Has fiance taken the dog to the vet? Has the dog been seen by a vet behaviourist? Has he got a trainer? Has your fiance done any of those things? Has your fiance done anything since the food aggression started?  If he hasn't done anything and this has been going on for some time, and you keep getting injured, then you have a fiance problem too. Your fiance should not be owning a dog at all, and he should be protecting you.\n\nThe dog can not be rehomed in good conscience, giving the severity of the bites, even with a family member, its extremely risky. If he was to go to a shelter or pound, he would not be rehomed because of this. He would be PTS.

You have been brutally attacked, and your fiance is doing nothing to ensure your safety. Sure, he wants to do training now, but it's too little too late. You can not be around that dog  during his rehabilitation. Given how your fiance has approached the situation, i do not have high hopes that rehabilitation will even work. If you put the dog to sleep or manage to rehome him, then your fiance will resent you. It may even be the end of your relationship. In my opinion, that's okay as your life is more important\n\nOut of curiosity, why do you keep getting attacked? I'd figure if the dog is food aggressive, your fiance would be feeding him. Was all the instances you were attacked regarding the dogs' food? Are you the one feeding him? Is he aggressive around food you or your partner are eating?

You said the dog had training before but the issue now is different & more serious. There seems to have been a few different changes for the dog that could be contributing to his behavior. But rehoming the dog now wouldn\u2019t be safe for the new family. You need to sit your fianc\u00e9 down & say what isn\u2019t negotiable to you regarding the dog if he wants to keep him: serious training, being in a crate when you\u2019re home alone with it (or outside if possible), & whatever else makes you feel safe.

There is ALWAYS a reason for any behavior in dogs. If the dog is showing agressive behaviors towards the food theres a reason for it. This is not an uncommon behavior and it's completely treatable.

He has a 4 year old German shepherd that as of the last 6 months or so has shown increased aggression around his food. 3 weeks ago I was bit which resulted in a puncture wound and severe bruising. Today I was bit again this time resulting in an urgent care visit that sent me to the ER all day due to nerve damage. I have several puncture wounds on both hands, wrist and one forearm. \n\nPrior to this I have expressed my concerns with the dogs constant barking disrupting my work from home, and his having accidents all over the house that we just remodeled. Those were annoyances, but things that we could have worked around. The aggression on the other hand is a real issue for me. I\u2019m scared of the dog now and our work schedules place me around the dog alone often.\n\nI have said that I am no longer comfortable living with the dog and my fianc\u00e9 is acting like I am lacking compassion for the dog and unwilling to find a compromise such as training. My school of thought is that training isn\u2019t a 100% guarantee and if we did that I would be living on eggshells just wondering when the next attack would be. He\u2019s a GSD so very capable of doing serious harm. I grew up with GSDs and love the breed but no longer feel safe around him. My fianc\u00e9 is saying I am asking him to give away a family member but all I want is to feel safe and secure in my own home. I feel like he is asking me to be repeatedly put in harms way.

You mentioned training isn't a 100% guarantee and you're right it can be a hit or miss! Would a compromise be possible where the dog stays with family he knows AND gets training? this way you don't have to be around the dog and he's still gonna get training to see if it works for him? My thinking with this suggestion is that it gives you a sense of peace in your home and the dog can potentially come back with you two IF 1. you feel safe to do that and 2. the training works !

My recommendation would be that bf either needs to be willing to put in some pretty strict and intensive training, possibly even hiring a trainer to come to the house to work with him and the dog, or rehome the dog to a person who has the time and experience, and probably no other dogs. My thought is that his resource guarding is getting worse because of too many changes in his life, and he might not be as ok as he seems with your other dog or you.\n\n\nMost importantly, though, is that you do not feel safe working with or around this dog. So bf needs to take over all feeding duties immediately at the very least. A shut door between the dog and you whenever food is present. Also, having a can of citronella spray on hand might not be a bad idea for your safety.\n\n\nI think this behavior can be changed since it's pretty predictable, but not if it puts you in harm's way.

If he was immediately apologetic and doing research etc maybe but I feel like he\u2019s saying \u201csounds like a you problem\u201d if I\u2019m honest.\n\nRehoming after a bite can basically only be done most places to rehabber or if you have proof it\u2019s a child that they\u2019re impacted by and they go to old couple for example. \n\nHe\u2019s a terrible partner but also a terrible dog owner. Dogs biting are stressed, anxious, angry etc. Essentially he\u2019s letting his dog suffer so he doesn\u2019t have to admit there is a problem", "This is exactly what I thought, too. It sounds like something could be medically wrong and causing this drastic escalation. \n\nOP, if your boyfriend is unwilling to look for solutions to help you feel safe in your own home again, it is a huge sign that it is time for you to walk. I am a dog lover and have a GSD myself and while it would take a whole lot for me to ever even just think of rehoming her, if she was acting like this, I would be trying everything to fix the issue. Vet evaluations, more training, and routine changes at home to immediately help, such as him taking over all feeding duties and ensuring that the dog is in a different room or kenneled whenever you have food.", "Yes let\u2019s reward the mauler for its shit behaviour", "Sounds like the way to solve this problem is for fewer people to buy pets, not for people like the OP to continue to put themselves in danger in the hope that training will work. Her safety is more important than the dog.", "Our dog had multiple tumours when he started acting like this. It was to late to do anything and we had to put him down.", "It\u2019s like you didn\u2019t even read the comment you\u2019re replying to. Ditch the weirdo who doesn\u2019t respect your safety.", "#GET RID OF THE FORTYSOMETHING MAN IN YOUR HOME FFS.\n\nYou are in your twenties, the home owner, and his dog continues to bite you without him caring. Snap out of it for christs sake and serve him an eviction notice: this is an abusive and coercive relationship.", ">How do I handle the dog by myself in the house in the meantime?\n\nYou don't. The dog needs to be rehomed asap (start researching GSD rescues in your area). And he needs to be muzzled anytime fiance isn't around. This dog needs someone that actually understands GSDs and has the time and dedication to exercise, train, and maintain that dog.\n\nY'all need to never get another working breed if you aren't going to work it. GSDs need a LOT of training, exercise, mental stimulation, obedience work, etc. They are wicked smart dogs. Smart dogs often turn aggressive when they are bored, understimulated, and under exercised.", "NTA but your passiveness is enraging. What are you waiting for, to lose a part of your hand or face or worse??\n\nIt's your house, grow a backbone and tell him to get the dog the fuck out TODAY.", "If he wants to go down the training route he needs to maintain your safety in the meantime. This might mean sending the dog away to get an extensive residential training course. There is room for compromise here but it\u2019s *minimal*. GSD bites are not joke. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to to rehome the boyfriend, and he doesn\u2019t want to rehome the dog, I would as a first step make sure the dog is fully vet checked to make sure the isn\u2019t any pain that is aggravating his aggression. Then straight off to a reputable boarding school.", "Plus he wants to quit his job and live off of her money", "It\u2019s actually one of the main reason why animal get agressives :/ fear and pain\n\nWe had a dog that was the loveliest animal in the planet and one day he became super agressive to the point where he was coming into our rooms for no reason, showing teeth at us. \nI think that was his way to tell us he really was in pain as we discovered he had a massive stomach issue. As soon as we fixed his pain (thanks vets) he was back to his normal fluffy lovely behaviour \ud83e\udd70\n\nNot saying that\u2019s the case here but it kind of make sense. How many humans become massive dicks when they are sick or in pain ? Yes they don\u2019t bite but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t fight back by bitting anymore. We mostly yell and act bad. Dogs don\u2019t, they bite and scratch :(", "I mean, if it didn't like the noise, it could. Like, there are definitely noises that dogs don't like. Humans snap at each other all the time over minor things like that, especially when they're in pain, and crossing the room to attack someone is like the dog equivalent of snapping. Not the harmless kind of snapping of course, but the kind of snapping that for a human would be like yelling at someone and throwing the closest object to hand at them.", "\"Don't buy the pet\" is not an actionable feedback when you already own the pet.\n\nThere is not reasons why OP would be in any danger while training. Some trainers can keep the dog at their home while they start the training. They can also isolate the dog from OP, either by keeping him in different part of the house, either by putting him in a cage when the fianc\u00e9 is not there.\n\nOP just didn't bother trying to find solution. They are just sitting there, waiting for the dog to be more an more agressive until they have a \"justification\" to euthanize him. That's not a responsible attitude.", "I\u2019m a huge dog fan. I\u2019m typing this with an enormous lab draped on my lap.\n\nGSDs are gorgeous dogs. But dogs are like people. Most are awesome. Some are assholes. They\u2019ve all got their own personalities. And training can only do so much. If I were OP I\u2019m not sure I could ever feel safe around that dog again. Regardless of how much training. And let\u2019s take this for a spin. The dog is known to be aggressive. What if he attacks someone else? Imagine the guilt. \n\nIt\u2019s like those news stories where some dog (or dogs) attacks someone and they were already known to be aggressive. And you ask yourself \u201cwho the hell would keep an aggressive dog?\u201d", "> He hasn\u2019t done anything. I\u2019m in the house now with him and the dog and he has the dog roaming free won\u2019t even put him in a crate until I go up to bed\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t making any effort to keep the dog confined to a space away from the OP even in the wake of her nerve damage. The OP is at risk. It is too big a risk to take if the fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t lift a finger to protect her. Anyway, I\u2019m done going around in circles with you."]}
