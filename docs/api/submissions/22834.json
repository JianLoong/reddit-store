She was a single mom and it was a sudden accident, so custody of her two sons (Adam 12, and Nathan 8) is up in the air. My surviving sister Amber (34) is looking like the top pick for custody, but the thing is, she\u2019s kind of a terrible mother to her own daughter already. She\u2019s ultra strict, doesn\u2019t respect her privacy (her daughter is 13), and her husband is an alcoholic who doesn\u2019t have a job and spends all day watching TV and yelling at their daughter.

You should look into getting them a Guardian Ad Litem, who can represent their interests in any legal proceedings. They would talk to you, your sister, your parents, etc as well as the boys and make recommendations.", "NTA, but 8 and 12 is old enough to have a say.  Has anyone asked them what they want?  Where is their father?\n\nA single parent household is miles better than a two-parent household with an abusive alcoholic as one of the parents.  Children do not need mothers specifically, they need PARENTS who love and parent them.  If you can do that, then you should continue your fight.  And maybe consider a room for your niece, who sounds like she's in a terrible situation, too.  \n\n\nSo sorry for your loss, and the continued stress of figuring out the best future for your nephews.", "NTA, but have you considered asking the kids what they would like?

Your nephew's well-being is what matters most here. Not Amber's belief that she's a great mother, or your parents' opinions.\n\nMake sure your lawyer knows about what Amber's home life is like for her own daughter.\n\nEDIT: and you might consider moving to be in their old school district if you get custody.", "NTA you are wonderful for wanting this keep fighting those boys need a stable home and lots of kindness and love.", "Your intentions are honorable. I absolutely understand why you think your home is better than your sister\u2019s. But I need more INFO:\n\nDoes your attorney legitimately think you are likely to win? I ask because custody battles are rough on kids, and there are judges who like a strict parent, and you might not be able to demonstrate the effect the alcoholic has on his daughter in a way that\u2019s admissible in court. \n\nShe has things in her favor on paper, things she can spin: she\u2019s already a mom, she has a two parent house, etc. \n\nIf your attorney really thinks you can win, keep fighting. But if this is a losing battle, you might be making things worse for the kids rather than better.", "NTA- keep fighting. Especially if you have proof that the father in Ambers home is an alcoholic and verbally abusive.", "NTA. I agree that a child does need a mother-figure in their life, but they have to be a *good* mother figure. Clearly, your sister is not it. Do *not* quit fighting for custody.", "I\u2019m sorry your parents are so sexist but NTA", "NTA. \n\n1. Your intentions seem good.\n2. It's easier to make new friends and adjust to a new school than it is to have to come home to a dysfunctional family.", "NTA my suggestion is get the boys into counseling. Let the therapist access you in which would be the better environment.\n\nMy guess would be for you. No kid should be raised with an alcoholic. \n\nBut make sure you are prepared before you go down this road. My guess this will get ugly. If your sister doesn\u2019t give up the idea of taking the boys you will have to call her parenting into question and raise the issue with her husband being an alcoholic. This will tear your family apart. And your sister may need reminded that fighting this in court could cause her to loose custody of her own \nChild. This doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do what is best for the boys but you need to walk into this willing to fight and the consequences be damned. You will be hated by your family.", "NTA. Has Ambers husband agreed to this? I just don\u2019t see that a court would give custody to a family where 1 person is an alcoholic, although I\u2019m assuming the others involved don\u2019t know about this otherwise I can\u2019t see why anyone would think it a good idea they go to Amber.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give up!", "Main thing what do the boys want ? Adults can fight forever about this ask what the boys want first", "NTA. Kids need a fatherly figure too, so that is just grade A bs.

Can you move to their school district?", "NTA but please, if you don't win, stay in these boys' lives. They're still your nephews and will need a stable sober presence in their lives.", "NTA keep fighting!  Boys need a good father figure and your BIL does not sound like one.", "NTA. Do not let those kids move in with an alcoholic. What is your family thinking? You're doing a good thing here. Keep fighting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
