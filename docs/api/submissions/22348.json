Classmates notice.\n\n\nFeeling like an outsider, even if (!!) the other kids aren\u2019t cruel, really sticks with a person.  This is a chance for your kids to have better versions of a basic need, clothing, with no cost to you.  The only potential price is your pride, which only applies if you let it.", "YTA. Matt went about this in an extremely kind and respectful way. He made an excuse of them needing clothes for the event in order to get them clothes they needed and you weren\u2019t able to buy, to save you some embarrassment. Would you really prefer your kids go without new clothes because you\u2019re too proud to accept help?", "YTA here\n\nYou admit they need new clothes and things are tough. He is trying to help you out.\n\nIf he's buying them deodorant and body wash it's also likely a hygiene issue is going on that you should probably address.", "YTA. \n\nYour kids NEEDED clothes. Not eventually. Now. And someone was gracious enough to purchase them and ensure they were presentable for the preview event. \n\nYou need to set aside your pride and both apologize and thank him. Now your kids have some of things they need.", "YTA and you owe Matt an apology. You admitted yourself you\u2019re on hard times. Someone went out of their way to do a kind thing for you and your children and you\u2019re being mad about it??? Suck up your pride.", "Is this a serious question? You admit you fell on hard times but instead of thanking this man for doing you a favor you chose to put your pride over your kids. If I was in your situation I\u2019d give him a big apology and a huge thank you. Put your kids above your pride. YTA", "YTA. Imagine getting mad at someone for helping your kids. Grow up.", "Your sons will always appreciate what kindness a neighbor like \u201cMatt\u201d is showing.", "I think what he did was so sweet!  I know how hard it is to ask for help and to want to do everything on your own. At the end of the day, your kids had a great time AND got presents. It's not like he bought them something you would never be able to afford. I do think you need to apologize, to be honest. I don't want to say anyone is the ah, because I know it was a pride thing and it hurts. Sometimes you just have to accept help. Have yourself a good cry, take a few breaths, and go over to tell him you're sorry for your reactions because it's so hard to not be able to do things for them like you wish you could. Unless he chastised you for not being able to afford things, it was from his heart.", "Soft YTA- Set aside how *you* feel about Matt buying things for your kids for a moment and ask yourself how *your kids* feel about it.", "YTA, your mom is right, because you are valuing your pride over concern for your sons. If Matt bought your son 4(!) deodorants and body wash, it probably means your son has problems maintaining hygiene. Matt might have also been using the movie as an excuse to buy some decent clothes for the boys without embarrassing them and you. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a bad parent, you may be doing the best you can, but right now you aren\u2019t cutting it. Part of your duty as a parent is to provide the basics for your kids. It\u2019s not Matt\u2019s job to look after your sons, it\u2019s yours (and by the way, where is there father in all of this?) and if you aren\u2019t able to do that you should be grateful that someone is helping.", "If your children are walking around in socks with holes and the best they can wear to an event is sweats please put your pride away for their sake. I won\u2019t say YTA, but your pride needs to stop where your children\u2019s benefit starts. Okay, I changed my mind. YTA.", "YTA. Stop letting your ego get in the way of your kids receiving they help they need.", "Your pride got in your way. Apologize. YTA. He did something nice.", "Sorry but YTA here. You seem to be letting pride get in the way of letting someone help when it's needed.", "Someone performed a mitzvah for you. Be gracious.", "YTA. Your kids come first, not your pride.", "YTA. He was being kind.", "YTA. Show some gratitude. Your kids deserve to have nice clothes and socks without holes.", "I can kinda understand where you are coming from but.... this person decided to make a gift to you and your sons out of the goodness of their heart.\n\nI can see where you might be coming from but definetely YTA", "YTA.  You're putting your children's benefit, well being, and self confidence behind your own pride. \n\nIt's a hard situation to be in, and you can feel free to deny yourself things for pride, but don't make that choice for your kids.", "YTA my parents were poor and our neighbors gave us hand me downs but our parents didn\u2019t let us have them. It was cruel as we had very few clothes and we were bussed to a well to do area high school. Tell the person thank you and have the kids bake them some cookies or something. They were being kind and they obviously care about your kids.", "YTA - this man is doing your family a giant favor and if you are ungrateful then yes your mom is right\n\nHE IS DOING YOUR BOYS A FAVOR.\n\nYou are just feeling ashamed. You should appreciate his generosity toward your boys.", "YTA in this situation you are puttning your pride before your kids", "YTA.\n\nSomeone is willing to help out with clothes and other things and you're complaining? Apologize and start figuring out how to be more humble.", "YTA I understand your pride is hurt, but your kids know your going through a hard time and that what Matt did for them was huge and I\u2019m sure they loved it and it felt good for them to have new things. You should apologize and thank him for being so kind and generous. You should look at this as having someone else in their life that cares about them and is willing to help you out. If you\u2019re down and out right now I think you could use all the help and support you can get. Just one more person in your corner!", "YTA. i know it can be hard to accept help but don\u2019t consider this help just consider it a gift from the universe through ur neighbor Mark and when you are in a better financial situation you can pay it forward somehow", "Soft Yta. I know you feel hurt and embarrassed that a neighbor provided what you struggle to provide yourself. You can still salvage this by apologizing. It\u2019s ok to feel the way you feel and I bet Matt will be understanding. It\u2019s ok to feel overwhelmed and hesitant to accept charity because that may make you question yourself as a parent. \n\n It can be hard to accept help but it will be ok and you got this!", "YTA\nBe proud of yourself, hold your head up high, have an ego\u2026 when it\u2019s only yourself.\n\nWhen you have kids you think of them and then only.  They needed new clothes, they got new clothes.  Be grateful", "YTA.  Learn to accept gifts and pay it forward when you are able.", "YTA put away the pride and say thank you. They did a kind thing, it's just clothes.", "YTA, sorry OP but you let Pride get in the way of someone who was just trying to do a good deed. I\u2019m sure your kids really fucking appreciated what he did for them and will always remember his kindness and pass it on down the road. Take this as an opportunity to thank him and apologize for letting your Pride speak for you and not your gratitude", "Soft yta you definitely over reacted. Matt was just tryin to be a nice guy he clearly adores your kids. Ever heard it takes a village? Because it does. The kids like him and id much rather have my kids surrounded by people that love them. You should apologize. I don't even know a single man who would do something so sweet just because. And this poor man is not asking for nothing in return. Just to help.\n\nEdit to add As far as the hygiene products i think he was just trying to get him prepared for teenager life style its so much easier from man to pre man. Just like if Matt had a daughter and you took her to get feminine products. I know women who don't even explain deodorant or pms products to their kids.", "YTA. He was helping you and your kids. Be thankful when people go out of their way to help you. Say thank you. Tell him you appreciate his kindness and generosity. Stop complaining.", "YTA. Accept the favour, it made your kids happy.", "YTA. He was helping your children out by providing what you're not. You should be appreciative.", "YTA. Don't let your pride deprive your kid of necessities like clothing and hygiene items.", "You're TA, but it's also an understandable and common reaction to be mad about it.  Ultimately, being insecure about accepting help like this can often come from feeling shame about your ability to provide or spite that you think other people are insinuating that you do not have an ability to provide. Both of those things are entirely understandable, and yet, at the same time, both those things are a result of projection and pride, and putting that over what's best for your son is what makes you TA. \n\nYour kid could use new clothes. Not just in the future, but by the sound of it right now. You, by your own admission, cannot meet that need imminently. And someone else has helped you and mostly your son to meet that need. The end result is that the need was met, and that's what should be the most important thing. Not your bruised ego or feelings of insecurity. Just because people help you doesn't mean they feel like you're a bad parent. They do it because they want to help. Should they have asked you first? I guess so, maybe. Then again, maybe they figured that you may be the type of person to say no, and figured it would be better to ask forgiveness than permission, given your son's need of clothes.", "YTA", "YTA. He was generous. You have too much pride in this situation. I really don\u2019t think he meant to hurt or embarrass you.", "YTA. Grow up.", "Do you believe Matt had any malicious intent?", "YTA\n\nYou would have your kids go without some nice extra clothes because of your pride?", "YTA if you let your pride hurt your kids. They need these clothes. I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I get that it\u2019s hard to accept help", "YTA\nSo\u2026your kids should go without because of your pride?", "Info: how well do you know this person? Did you check with your sons to see if they felt comfortable with this shopping trip? Did they try on clothes by themselves? Or did Matt help them? If at all. My immediate concern would be for their safety over charity if my children came home with all this stuff.", "He should have asked your consent first.  There is nothing wrong with people wanting to help but one should always ask.", "Idk, a grown man taking so much interested in a boy rings lots of alarms for me. Maybe the guy had good intentions but if I was the mom it wouldn\u2019t feel right for me either. Maybe if the guy had given a heads up about the event and how the boy needed to dress nicer and THEN offer to buy some clothes, but he did it without permission so I\u2019m gonna say NTA", "You are NTA, but I do think your pride is clouding your response. It sounds like this person is a kind neighbor who wanted to help out and there is nothing wrong with accepting help when you fall on hard times. Someday, when you\u2019re back on your feet, you can pay it forward.", "My first thought is why does this grown man want to spend all this time with your sons? It could be completely innocent but it raises some red flags with me.", "NTA bc as mothers, we can be protective of our children and wonder if someone is trying to groom them using kindness. However, do you know Matt\u2019s story? Maybe he went through it as a child and feels a need to help out. Talk with your neighbor, and your children about receiving gifts. Matt should\u2019ve at least texted you about going shopping with your kids.", "NTA, that's actually pretty weird. He is just a neighbor but he goes around spending a non-insignificant amount of money buying the kids clothes without even asking you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
