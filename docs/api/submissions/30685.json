I live in a traditional dorm room that I share with another girl. \n\nMy roommate (19F) is a second-year international student and we\u2019ve gotten along well enough up until a few weeks ago. We were never best friends or anything, but we were cordial and would regularly go eat together if we were both free. With that being said, she has a complicated love life situation that I don\u2019t ask questions about. Since she\u2019s international, her (ex?) boyfriend lives back in their home country and as far as I know, they\u2019re broken up but still talk pretty much every day. \n\nSo the story. The weekend of Halloween, I was out with my friends on the \u201cparty avenue\u201d of our college campus (for lack of a better term). Towards the end of our night, my friends walked me to the shuttle stop so I could get back to my dorm. On the way, I got a text from a random number which I then realized was her (ex?) boyfriend. He was spamming me telling me that she isn\u2019t answering his calls and she told him beforehand that she was hanging out with me (which was not true). After a few minutes, he sent me a wall of text telling me every bad thing she\u2019s said about me. That she hates spending time with me, that she dislikes that I always go out on the weekends, complaining about how my boyfriend\u2019s name is \u201creligious.\u201d Mind you, he has a very common name that just happens to be biblical. Think \u201cElijah\u201d or something similar. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s important to mention that earlier in the semester, he kept requesting to follow my instagram account (which he somehow found) and I kept declining it. I told her about it and she just told me to keep declining and ignore it. He kept doing it and I eventually blocked him. So him having my number made me super uncomfortable. \n\nAs it was happening, I sent her the screenshots of what he was saying and she denied telling him any of that, which I obviously don\u2019t believe because how else would he know these details about my life? Anyway, I felt uncomfy spending the night there after that so my boyfriend picked me up and took me to his place. When I came back on Sunday, she acted like nothing ever happened. I do not interact with her whatsoever unless I have to because that entire situation just rubbed me the wrong way. She\u2019s been acting frustrated at my distance and I\u2019m starting to worry that I\u2019m being unreasonable. AITA?\n\nedit: typo\n\nTLDR: My roommate\u2019s (inappropriate) boyfriend texted me telling me how much crap she talks about me and I distanced myself but don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reacting the right way.", "created_utc": 1699573910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rqr7k/aita_for_giving_my_roommate_the_cold_shoulder/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she gave it to him or just was careless and let him get the number I'd be furious.  \n\nHer minimizing and brushing this off is a bad idea and keeping your distance from her will ensure you're not collateral damage.", "NTA that was very inappropriate. How the hell did he get your number and she should be tripping over herself apologizing for his creepy stalkerish behavior and for using you as an alibi; never mind the awful things she said. See if you can find a new roommate next semester; show the screenshots to housing and say you don\u2019t feel safe.

She just wants to twist the situation to not make herself look like a crap roommate, but it is what it is.\n\nNext year, try to get a solo room.", "NTA. I would ask for a new roommate, and I would provide the school with all the proof you have (texts, etc.). She is obviously feeding her unstable bf info about you and it was especially wrong of her to give him your number (assuming that's how he got it). This doesn't sound like a safe situation for you to be in.", "Listen you do what you gotta do to feel safe.\n\nBUT do you really think those things he mentioned couldn't have been \"innocent\" comments.\n\nIe Where's your roommate?(since he seems to have an unhealthy interest in you).   \"Oh she's out with Elijah, she goes out with him most weekends.  (how much of this info is public on Instagram?  Could he have got your boyfriend's name that way?)  \n\nJust a thought.\n\nThis could be Not AH or No one(meaning you and roomie, creepy ex is AH on all counts).", "I don't know if she gave him the number or not but you need to talk to her!\n\nAlso it's very easy to find people phone number in the Internet using Spokeo or Truthfinder", "Her Ex is an absolute asshole. That is really uncomfortable behavior from him. \n\nI think it may be NAH for you and the roommate though. If you guys previously had a good relationship I think it's likely that he is either making things up or twisting her words to try and create drama. I'm sure if they were close there has been some level of complaining about her roommate to him, not in a bad way, but in the way that everyone occasionally moans about that kind of thing especially at a young age when it's the first time having one, and with potential cultural differences included. \n\nFrom the examples you gave of things she reportedly said, nothing was super specific or hard to work out from innocent conversation or normal level roommate complaints.   Knowing that you go out on weekends could easily come up in innocent conversation,  as could knowing your boyfriends name, and saying she hates spending time with you is a fairly easy lie to tell. \n\nI think immediately cutting her off may be an over reaction, if you guys previously had an ok relationship then it would be worth sitting down and having a talk.  Roommates don't always have to be the closest of friends but it really does help if you get along to some degree.", "NTA and I feel you've overthought this. You never knew him, ended up blocking him, yet he stalks you down again. He's certainly not trustworthy so I'd question anything he says. But, you were never really close friends with her regardless, she's done nothing to make you want to get closer with her, she may have been talking smack on you, and hasn't apologized for his bizarre behavior. Just ignore her and move on.", "Ask her, point blank, if she DOES have any issues with you (ones that you should care about, anyway - like who is she to be upset if you go out or what your bf's name is so don't worry about that, etc.). Otherwise, write it off as her venting stupid shit to her friend as she tries to adjust to a new environment. And definitely tell her anything she does that bothers you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I understand, you found out some info and now you\u2019re protecting yourself by distancing from a potential source of harm. However the ex could be mixing some facts up. As in, sprinkling in some truth into his lies to make it believable. \n\nI would have a second conversation with this girl. If she\u2019s a good person she\u2019ll understand your distance and appreciate you trying to make amends. I say this only because your source (the ex) is super unreliable. However if this second convo doesn\u2019t go well or she still rubs you the wrong way, I\u2019d just continue to keep distance. Not worth the worry tbh. \n\nIt all really depends if this girls friendship will add or subtract from your own life.", "Probably NTA.\n\nI might be wrong about this, but I suspect your roommate's ex-boyfriend is not a great guy. He sounds very possessive and controlling, and I'm wondering how much of her being in contact with him every day was something she was reluctant to do. From what you're saying, he could have been trying to keep control of her despite the distance... including through you. If that theory is correct, then nothing he says should be believed. He could be driving a wedge between you two to get back at her, to get you to snitch on her. You know better than us what your roommate might have told you about the guy or not, though. That said, if she encouraged you not to give him access to you \\*and\\* tried to stop communications with him, it's worth asking her upfront : WHY ?\n\n>she has a complicated love life situation that I don\u2019t ask questions about\n\nAsk the question you're afraid to ask.\n\nMaybe some of the stuff he knows, he didn't get from her. Maybe he got bits and pieces from her by calling/texting her all the time, and the rest he extrapolated. Maybe she really told him (but then there could be several reasons why).\n\nHave that conversation with your roommate. Maybe I'm wrong about this. But also maybe it's more complicated.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. It is completely understandable that you are uncomfortable and are giving your roommate the cold shoulder after her boyfriend texted you in such an inappropriate manner. It is not unreasonable for you to distance yourself from her after that, and she should be understanding of that.", "Well that's why I asked for outside opinions. I considered the possibility that I was being narrow minded/thinking about it the wrong way. And in my defense, when you get bombarded with messages telling you the mean and specific things your roommate said about you, you proceed with caution. I don't really think I was wrong for initially feeling hurt by that.", "OP clearly said she was thinking that it\u2019s impossible for the ex bf to know certain details about her and her life unless her roommate shared them with him. So I think OP is NTA, she has a right to feel hurt, but I don\u2019t think she should let it get to her too much. It\u2019s clear the ex is just trying to punish the roommate, and is likely exaggerating and twisting a lot of the things she said. OP and roommate should have a convo and clear the air, it\u2019ll be stressful for *both* of them to be so at odds when they have to share a space!\ud83d\ude05", "So about a month and a half ago, she told me they broke up but they still talk pretty much every day. I\u2019m frequently also in the room when they talk on the phone so I can confirm that. And no, there is no other way for him to have gotten my personal phone number.", "Thank you for replying! And yeah that\u2019s where a lot of my worry comes from. Although I don\u2019t like that she gave my number out/used me as an alibi, I did ask myself *why* she felt the need to use an alibi in the first place. So that\u2019s what\u2019s making me second guess whether or not I\u2019m going about this the wrong way.", "Then yeah NTA. That's weird. You're not an emergency contact lol", "Definitely have a talk with her, text her and schedule it so you don't just put it off forever. Communication is key to every relationship even if it is uncomfortable sometimes.", "It's easier to ask, than to try and guess :)"]}
