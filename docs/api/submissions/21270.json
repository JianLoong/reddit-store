Toward the end of my reception, my husband's brother proposed to his girlfriend. I was a little irritated because he didn't ask my husband or me beforehand if it was ok, but overall, it was the very end of my reception, so I didn't say anything and let them have their moment. She said yes, and my husband's family celebrated it for a bit before we all said our goodbyes and headed home.\r  \n\r  \nfast forward to a couple of weeks ago, my husband's brother has his wedding, the reception happened and everything was going great until about an hour and a half in. I and the new bride were talking and my husband's youngest brother comes up to us and asks the bride if he can propose to his girlfriend. She said absolutely, seeing as the same thing happened at my wedding, it's like a brotherly tradition. About 20ish minutes later he got on one knee and popped the question. She said yes, then suddenly the new husband came over and started yelling at his brother, stuff like \"How could you\", \"This day isn't about you\", and overall causing a scene. the two of us rush over and tried to explain. The new wife told him that she gave her blessing but he didn't seem to care at all, still pissed.\r  \n\r  \nThen I said, \"You have no room to talk, as you proposed at MY wedding, without asking me or your brother.\" His response was \"That doesn't count as it was my husband's second wedding, so it doesn't matter as much\". His brother's comment cut pretty deep, he got married to someone who told him she was pregnant but turned out she never was. I responded in a way I now regret, \"So you want your younger brother to wait till you get married again to propose?\" I didn't mean it but I certainly see how it comes off, I was just pissed that he would say that, my brother-in-law I think saw my point, but walked away seemingly still angry.\r  \n\r  \nThe bride was visually upset and that's when I realized what I said and immediately started apologizing. She told me she understood why I said it, and that her husband was being a bit overboard, but after we all went home, my husband's family, including his brother (older one) were saying I was an asshole for defending \"bad behavior\". I received a text from his youngest brother, thanking me for standing up for him, and that a lot of the family is mad at him too. I kept apologizing to the bride and she seems fine now, but can't know for sure what damage my comment did, and that sucks. I am genuinely sorry about my comment, it just pissed me off when he said he thought my wedding was less important than his.

You made a mistake in the moment, after a comment that would hurt anyone\u2019s feelings, and after realizing that mistake you have since apologized.", "ESH\n\nIt's hilarious as a storyline for a soap opera though.", "NTA - you were reacting to the brother\u2019s comment, not trying to insult his new wife. When you realized how it came across, you apologized.", "Haha NTA. I think your response was perfect IMO. He basically said your wedding was less important than his because the girl before you tricked your husband? You simply pointed out his hypocrisy here. Even if I was the bride/SIL when you said this, I wouldn\u2019t have taken it as an attack on me personally. \n\nAlso, as far as the proposing at people\u2019s wedding thing goes, I\u2019ve seen it done where the bride was in on the plan and execution. Basically during the bouquet toss, instead of her just blindly throwing it, she turned around and handed the bouquet to the girl being proposed to. The girl was standing there for like half a second confused before the guy came out of nowhere with a ring and got down on one knee. So maybe try that next time if any of your other family members decide to propose during *their* wedding, may prevent any confusing or hard feelings lmao.", "ESH\n\nYou and the brothers all sound terrible.

I'm a firm believer in if you want to come at me, you're getting it back in spades. Nice job. And  I'm sure your friend understands.", "She and I have been close since middle brother introduced her at a family gathering. I was a bridesmaid. I've apologized profusely ever since, she's said on multiple occasions she forgives me and she understands why I slipped up like that. She knows I think highly of their relationship since every other moment other than the outburst at the wedding middle brother has been super sweet and kind, especially to his new wife", "my husband actually joked about that a few nights later when we had his youngest brother and his new fiancee over for a little celebratory dinner (we would have invited the middle brother and his wife over but they were on their honeymoon)", "thank you. I've apologized many times since she's gotten back from her honeymoon and on the night of the wedding. she's said she forgives me, I'm just worried she's holding back how she feels", "yeah, that was one of my worst moments. she and I are really close, and she's said she's forgiven me multiple times, I'm just worried she's holding back how she actually feels. I love her and she's been a part of the family since before she was even proposed to.", "I didn't mind other than the fact he didn't check with us if it was alright, and my SIL approved of it in front of me so I don't think she did either. though youngest probably should've checked with his brother in hindsight, he told us he thought it was alright since he was just doing what his brother did at my wedding.", "Oh sorry, my comment about her accepting your apology may have come off a little snarky\u2014but it was meant to be sincere. I\u2019m glad to hear she forgave you.", ">  but can't know for sure what damage my comment did, and that sucks. I am genuinely sorry about my comment, it just pissed me off when he said he thought my wedding was less important than his. So Reddit, do you guys think I'm the asshole?\n\nYour comment did no damage. You apologised, a lot. \n\nPeople shall not forget the wedding any time soon unless youngest brother's wedding is an absolute corker of a season finale.\n\nI wasn't even there and it's my favorite wedding ever.", "There's an almost infinite demand for drama... perhaps you could become the next Kardashians!\n\nI mean... don't but ...", "It probably bothered her when she heard it, like you were bothered by the proposal at your wedding. But you got over it, and she did\u2014or will, too. We all say stupid things, especially when reacting to something hurtful said to us. Give yourself a break, she will be fine.", "NTA  Not at all. The brother who proposed at your wedding is a hypocrite and he insulted you and your wedding. Your comment back was perfect.  Snarky but perfect.  I wish I was that witty as quickly. \n\nThe SIL should not be offended. If she is mad at anyone, it should be at her own husband for creating drama at their wedding.  She consented to the proposal. He shoujd have just shut up at that point but didn't.  \n\nLet it go.  The sil got over , if her husband doesn't,  that's his problem.  \n\nSeriously, he made such a rude comment to you about your wedding so deserved what he got.", "You, younger and middle brother are ashhole . I would have kicked the younger brother out of the wedding. He has no common sense. Biggest asshole.\n\nYou are just enabling his behaviour. You and husband should have been kicked out as well. Asshole\n\nMiddle brother had no right to bring your personal information while speaking. Asshole .", "Lol bonus points for the new account explanation.", "ESH. There needs to be two yes's for proposals at the wedding. It doesn't matter if the bride said yes when the groom says no. Both parties should have been asked and both should've been given permission.\n\nObviously, Groom was not okay with this so it makes Bride's approval moot. And he has the right to be upset about the proposal happening.\n\nHowever, his doing the same at your wedding as well as his comment about your wedding not counting was an AH move as well.\n\nYour comment was unnecessary and cruel to not only the Groom but also the Bride. But you seem to have awareness on that and it's great that you apologized.\n\nBride is also a bit of an AH for not clearing the proposal with Groom as well before just giving him a blanket okay.\n\nOther Brother is also an AH for not getting approval from Bride and Groom and going based off only one person.", "Let me get this straight you feel the younger brother who literally asked for permission is more of a asshole then the middle brother who did the exact same thing with no permission at all? And why should op and her husband been kicked out? Cause they called out the hypocrisy? The actual fuck?", "The middle brother literally proposed at your wedding with no permission and had the audacity to get mad at his brother for doing the same except the brother asked the bride for permission first? Yeah your NTA for calling out his hypocrisy.", "It is not like she can be truthful and be angry at you as it will cause unnecessary drama. I am guessing she will distance herself from you .", "NTA:  IATA because I think that was a great response.   It wasn\u2019t against the wife, it was against his bs statement about your wedding.   She says she forgives you, hopefully she sees the statement for what it was.", "NTA, and honestly, you could have meant it as a dig just to him - you are part of the family because of his brother - sooooo you could be going to his second wedding because his awesome first wife decided he was an a$$hole and she left him.  You wouldn\u2019t get to go with her, you\u2019re stuck with the a$$hole. Yes, I know, I know, still deserves an apology to the bride (which you more than covered), but you were saying *a lot* more about him than her.  What person wants to be married to that kind of insensitive hypocrite?", "NTA.  The one comment was a little bad but the bride was okay with it so it is what it is.\n\nMiddle brother sounds like a horrible hypocrite.", "NTA. Yeah shitty thing to say but you apologised and understood the repercussions of the comment. \nYour BIL is an absolute hypocrite and the fact that the family is defending him shows who the favourite is. So he\u2019s allowed to not ask permission at all but younger brother asked permission from the wife and still gets the flack, did he not realise it was your wedding too. Yeah he should\u2019ve asked his brother but guess what he actually asked. \nFor him to blow up like that is just entitled behaviour, you are not in the wrong. If the family keeps giving you shit for defending younger BIL just ask them where that energy was when he proposed to his wife and YOUR wedding.", "Your comment was not okay, but you realized that and apologized.\n\nYNTA for defending the youngest brother, besides he at least asked if he could do that. \nThe middle brother is the real AH. \nEven if it was your husband second wedding, doesn't mean it was ok for him to pop the question without asking (especially if it was your first wedding, but even if it wasn't, it was not ok for him without permission)", "Younger brother did not ask permission from brother. He only asked his wife for permission.", "And?\nIf he felt closer to her or felt it was something she will communicate with her husband... ??? \n\nBesides, karma is a bitch."]}
