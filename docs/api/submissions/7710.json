You sacrificed ONE DAY to be with hers. It\u2019s a fair compromise and it would\u2019ve been doubly unfair to her and her family to have it by your family\u2019s instead. It\u2019s a catch 22", "My goodness, no. NTA. You sound like a very considerate husband and son; you found them cheap flights and accommodations *and* had a home celebration for everyone who couldn't attend the wedding. What more could you have done, really?? Your parents are being mean.", "100% NTA.\n\nIt is your wedding. It's an event for, and to celebrate, YOU and YOUR Spouse. They were being shitty and more than a little bit entitled.", "NTA absolutely NTA. not much else to add. \nI thought that the family is in another country, but this isn't the case, so I don't see any reasons to be mad.", "NTA. It was your wedding, you had every right to do as you and your wife wanted.", "NTA you chose it based on what was best for you and your wife. They should let it go. Especially since none of them dropped a single red cent to make your wedding happen.", "NTA. \n\nY\u2019all\u2019s wedding, your choices. There\u2019s no easy decision when families are split like that. Everyone won\u2019t be pleased but if they love you they should understand. You just gotta make one and roll with it. I was in same situation. My wife\u2019s family was about 700 miles from most of my family with my dad being even farther. We discussed options and quickly I decided to get married by her family down near the Texas/Mexico border.  It meant most of my coworkers and family wouldn\u2019t be there but everyone understood and no feelings hurt.", "NTA.  First, its yall's wedding, not theirs.  Second, its traditional in much of the US of the wedding to occur where the bride's family lives.  Third, their whining is unwelcome and rude.  They need to get over it.  They made choices, they get to live with them, they don't get to keep complaining and expecting you will remain around them.", "Absolutely NTA! You went above and beyond by arranging free accommodations and local transportation. You also had a big get together with your own family afterwards. This was a very good compromise and your family should stop grumbling.", "NTA", "NTA. You have every single right to do whatever you and your wife want. It is YOUR day. Not theirs. They had their days. If they aren't happy with your decision as a couple, then they will have to either overcome their feelings and travel to support their family.

Traditionally (in the US, anyway), the wedding takes place in the bride's hometown, unless it's a destination wedding. \n\nYour family is being extremely rude and disrespectful. They don't get to dictate where someone else's wedding is held.", "Some people are never content unless things are done their way and events such as weddings seem to bring forth a lot of opinions. People tend to forget though, that the wedding is about the bride and groom and THEIR choices.\n\nNTA. You sound like a great husband", "NTA. Had you sided with your family, it would be her family grumbling. You can't make everyone happy in wedding decisions and just have to do the best for yourselves, which it sounds like you did.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s pretty common to get married in the bride\u2019s home town.  I\u2019m not sure why your family is so surprised by this.", "NTA. It's your soiree. You determine the time and place. You've already shown you understand if someone cannot make it. You've accepted this consequence. I see nothing wrong here.", "NTA. My brother and SIL had a similar situation, except they live in her hometown and got married in ours. Just like you, they tried to make things as convenient as possible for family/friends who traveled, including all of her family and some friends staying with our family and scheduling the wedding during a school break (for the parents/educators), Her family stayed with ours for an entire week and by the end of it we were all one big happy family. Just last summer, my brother and SIL came to visit with my SIL's sister and husband, along with both of their kids. All 5 of their kids were in and out of my family home, just like my cousins and I did as kids. I'm sorry that your family didn't appreciate that this wedding was about two families, not just theirs, and they missed an opportunity to get to know the people who created the woman that you love.", "NTA.", "NTA. You celebrated with both families, and arranged for free accommodation for your immediate family at the actual wedding. Your family should grumble and complain about the location of the desert and the ocean and how you didn't magically bring them together on your wedding day. It would make just as much sense.", "NTA. You were both reasonable and generous. And it also seems fair that you would get married closer to her family, since the rest of your lives are near your family.", "Most people don\u2019t contribute to weddings they are invited to", "Oh I get that. My point is that they don't get a say on where they have the wedding. I can see when a parent is paying for it. Then I can see where they have business commenting."]}
