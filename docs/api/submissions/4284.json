I grew up with mom and step dad and dad and step mom. My kids call them grandma and grandpa and papa and dee dee. They understand the dynamic because we have always been open about it but, I would never diminish the love and affection by making it a qualifier that my kids had to call them \"step\" anything. My step dad and my step mom have always treated me and my siblings as their own and my kids as their grandkids. My husband has had a best friend for 30 years and we call him uncle to our kids, because 30 years is as good as blood to us.

Your bio dad abandoned you, his family forgot about you, and then he died. **Now** ***they want to step in and try to tell you how to run your family?*** No. No, best fren, that is not how things work.

My mother remarried when I was about 12, my parents having gotten divorced when I was 5 or so.  While me and my stepfather weren't super close (I always called him by name), he never failed to offer to include me in his interests. He always helped me financially if I needed it, and never asked for repayment. The guy wasn't a saint, but he was definitely my dad. My bio father also got remarried, and became more interested in that family, as well as being a workaholic and becoming reborn Christian. Between work, his new family, and religion,  we became NC for a long time.\nWhen my daughter finally came along, my stepfather was her grandfather. No doubt about it. Blood didn't matter. And he really was a great grandfather to her. Sadly, he passed away when she was six. Four years later, I live next to my bio-father, and my daughter just knows him as my father, not her grandfather. \nSo if you say that your stepfather is your child's grandfather, I believe you.", "NTA. \n\nI didn't realize til college that my maternal grandpa was technically my mom's step-dad although she did call him by his first name.

Bio dad might be dead now, but when he was alive he never took the time to ever get to know you. By the sound of your post even when he was dying of cancer he never bothered.

They call my bio dad grandpa too. Even if your bio dad were around and also being a grandfather, there's not actually a limit on how many grandparents you get to have. My kids are super lucky to have my stepdad as a grandfather; he's awesome. \n\nAlso, \"step grandparent\" is super clunky. I only ever referred to my stepdad's parents that way if I was trying to explain the familial relationship and why I had 3 sets of grandparents. I think I was a bit too old to ever really adjust to calling my stepdad \"dad\" (my younger sister calls both him and our bio dad \"dad\"), but I definitely saw him as a parent, a father figure, and also my family, and that extended to his family - his parents are my grandparents. His brothers are my uncles. I'm lucky to have these additional family members, a lack of shared DNA just doesn't matter. And outside of explaining to a third party who everyone is, I don't find that \"step\" designation particularly useful. It may be for people who don't have strong bonds with their step families, but I do. It would feel silly to teach my kids to think of them as separate from other family somehow when that's not how we function and relate to each other.", "NTA\n\npeople act like the dead were saints when most of them were actually horrible people\n\nblock then and move on, wish you the best \u2764", "NTA, it takes more than blood to make a family.

Who wrestled with me when i was little to WWE, who taught me to bleed brakes, who i have too many memories to fill here.  Point- some family would call him by his name. Nope. Grandpa.

Neither of the new partners are a parent to me (I was too old) but both are grandparents to my sons", "Your stepdad is your child\u2019s grandpa. Said as a mom who has a dad that\u2019s not really around and a stepdad that I think of as my dad who I call him by his first name. My dad is papa my stepdad is grandpa, my mom is grandma (my son says myga) and my stepmom is grandma first name (myga first name lol) and that only because both grandma\u2019s are called grandma by all their grandkids. My stepsisters kids call my mom grandma first name and her mom grandma. And my stepsisters kids call my dad and stepmom papa/papa first name and grandma. Lol blended families are not rare and in almost all stepparents that came around years before grandkids are called some for of grandparent name by the grandkids and if both sides use the same thing for a grandparent usually they just tack on the stepparents first name at the end. I myself have three grandmas and a mama, all three grandma\u2019s get their first name used when I\u2019m talking about them to the other side of my family the only one that has always been grandma first name is my stepdads stepmom and that because I was introduced to her by her first name and decided to call her grandma. I also have three grandpas and a papa, and only 1/4 was I related to by blood and he got called he grandpa nickname well the other two were grandpa first name. It just made life easier and my mama and papa were my stepdads mom and stepdad I never needed to use their first names because I never needed to clarify who I was talking about to either side. Your biodad isn\u2019t in your kids life but your stepdad is this is your choice not your biodads family\u2019s. I will also add that my sons father isn\u2019t around at all but I\u2019m still in contact with his mom even though she hasn\u2019t seen my son in over two years I refer to her as grandma first name to my son. My son is 3 he doesn\u2019t care who is blood and who isn\u2019t he just knows who is around more.", "Do you have long ears?   :)   hehehe."]}
