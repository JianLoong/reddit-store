I told my wife I was surprised and upset that she didn't give me a heads up that she was taking 3 months off, so that we could make the most of the time and maybe take a trip somewhere fun together. She apologized but then seemed to shrug it off. \n\nFor context, her lack of \"us\" planning and her withholding of plans she makes with friends and family (w/o discussing anything with me) was a major issue when we saw a couples therapist a couple of years ago. Her vacation time was consumed by friends and family plans. My partner's reasoning for not making plans for the two of us was that she's worried I won't like what she suggests. Our therapist told her she needs to overcome that and start prioritizing quality time as a couple. To date I've initiated all of the \"us\" trips, so the therapist set her the task of making plans for a change. 18 months later it still hasn't happened. \n\n4 weeks after leaving her job, with her going to visit family, and making plans only with friends, I asked her if she wanted to do something together and she said \"yes\" but didn't have any ideas. I then asked if she'd already made plans to travel with anyone else during her time off work. She said \"no\". \n\nI suspected she was lying so I asked her three more times and she eventually admitted that she was trying to plan a trip to go away with an old college friend the following month but that her friend hasn't confirmed her availability yet. I was neither informed prior to this, nor invited at that point. \n\nI then felt very hurt and shared that I felt that after years of us not taking any fun couples trips away (we met travelling and had several fun trips together years ago) that she was still prioritizing plans with friends and family. This is after her working at the same place for 6 years and using it as an excuse for not travelling together because she is \"busy\" and isn't sure if she will be available. Only to then tell me \"Hey, next month I'm taking a trip to Sun Valley with my friends\". \n\nI got pissed and she is acting confused and saying I'm being a jerk about it.

Who takes off work for months without discussing it first with their partner? Who makes solo plans when they are in a relationship? And is shady and cagey about it?

You're stable, unchallenging, easily brushed off. She goes and does what she wants and makes unilateral decisions that affect you both(the household) by taking months off without discussion. \n\nIt's not the first time you've had issues. You've had the therapist \"on your side\" but it just sounds like you never actually got HER on your side or agreeing with you or the therapist. \n\nSimply put. You're not a priority to her. \n\nI have to assume you simply enable her lifestyle and so I say convenience rather than a relationship. She finds you easy, she gets what she wants from you and doesn't contribute back, she deals with you not only on her terms, but only when you present yourself as an obstacle and only when you can't be avoided. \n\nYou're not her partner. You're being treated like \"the help\" or her assistant to which she has no consideration beyond what she needs. She considers everyone else before you including people she's not spoken to in years. \n\nIf I asked you \"what do you get out of this relationship?\" Or \"what does she contribute or bring to the table?\". I would want an answer beyond your feelings. I.e. \"but, I love her\" is how you feel, but it's not what she contributes or brings to the table. \n\nIf it's \"she pays half the rent\" that's also expected, she needs somewhere to live, like anyone, needs to pay rent. \n\nBeyond her most basic life necessities and beyond how you feel. What does she give you back. \n\nI hope the answer is more than just placations and unfulfilled promises. \n\nI ask all of that, coz it sounds like you OP are pouring everything in, and she's sucking you dry.", "Making travel plans without one's partner seems a pretty clear signal though, doesn't it?", "To me it does"]}
