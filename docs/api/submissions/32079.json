Thanj you for taking the time to read this.\n\nI (25F) have been with my girlfriend (Rita - 27F) for 10 months. I've always known I was bi, but for a long time, I used to date casually. So in a sense this is my first serious and healthy relationship, and the only time I fell head over heels in love with someone.\n\nI live in a different state than all of my other family members and my job is very demanding so I don't really get to see them much throughout the year. I would like to introduce Rita to my family, and since my mom hosts us all for Christmas, I thought maybe that would be a good time. Also, while I did somerimes talk to my family about my previous parrners, I never brought anyone home. So for me, to feel like this is a huge deal.\n\nI even asked Rita to keep her schedule clear for a few days at that time (which is extremely hard for her because she's a medical resident and she rarely gets to be off for that long). When I told my parents that I would like to do that, they said Christmas was for family members only, and that my brother (Charlie - 35M) and his wife (Emily - 32F) are finally expecting a baby after several failures over years, and that he told my parents multiple times that he would like the entire attention to be on them, not me, for once.\n\nI argued that I literally had no other time available for me or Rita to travel, and that I was serious about her and she may end up being family sooner than they think. My parents didn't agree. So I called Charlie and asked her about this nonsense. He went on a 15 minute rant saying he felt he was invisible when I came around and would like to share this huge moment in his life and I would be a huge AH bringing a girl home for the first time ever and overshadowing him.\n\nIt escalated into an argument, and I hung up saying I'm too tired to have this conversation now and we'd talk later. So I called my mother and said I won't be coming home for Christmas if Rita isn't coming, because I don't want to leave her alone for the holidays. My mother told me I was being petty because Rita couldn't care less about this (she is Jewish).\n\nI said I was giving my brother all the spotlight in the world. I got several messages from Charles after this saying it would create even more drama. Am I being a petty AH like they all say I am?", "created_utc": 1701380009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187ttqe/aita_for_not_going_home_for_christmas_and_being/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately parents often have children that they favor more than the other intentionally and unintentionally and makes things more complicated in the sibling relationships as adults. I\u2019m not saying this is the case or accusing anyone but I will say that your brothers feelings of wanting to be seen more could be fine if that\u2019s the case. Regardless this is no doing of your own and it sounds like this is a new sudden rule they just through out there so you not wanting to go without your girlfriend is also very valid. You aren\u2019t being petty, you want to spend time with your gf for the holidays and this will be your first holiday season together as a couple.", "NTA. Let them spend all their attention on your brother, since that's what they explicitly want. Enjoy your time off with your girlfriend!", "NTA\n\nI always like the view that family is not only blood-related people, but also important people close to you (and sometimes even animals like dogs/cats or smth). Like Emily, she isn't blood-related either but apparently still considered family. So if you're serious about Rita, how is that any different? Imo it is exactly the same, so Rita is as much family as Emily is.\n\nThat being said: Seems like they have decided that ur an ass either way. If you bring Rita you take all the spotlight, whatever that means, if you don't bring her you a) leave Rita alone and b) every comment will be held against you like \"ur just acting like that bc you couldnt bring Rita), and if you don't go it \"creates drama\" as well (whatever that means).\n\nChristmas nowadays is way more than a christian festival (atleast imo). There are lots of people that celebrate it that aren't christian, so making the argument that she won't care anyway cuz she's jewish is just wrong without actually asking her (I mean maybe its true, but its bad to just assume it).\n\nImo, sticking with Rita is the best approach. Shows that you're actually serious about her, and also removes yourself from any drama (cuz if it creates drama at ur familys christmas party - you aren't there, so doesnt affect you as much).", "NTA...You're not being petty. Your parents are being petty with their family only rule,  which seems to serve no purpose other than keeping your girlfriend away. Stay behind and create your own traditions together and have the best time. Your family is free to bask in your brother's newfound visibility. Merry Christmas!", "I feel we are missing a lot of INFO here: Do you feel the underlying reason Rita is unwelcome is because she is a woman? Why does Charlie think you are an attention hog? Is Rita still eager to go meet your family if she is not welcome/only there at your insistence?", "NAH:  But truthfully, I would 2nd guess your decision unless you're planning on cutting your family out your life.  Because all you would be doing is making a pretty awkward moment when your family does meet your girlfriend.  \n\nI get you're excited for them to meet her but at the same time you shouldn't feel you get to dictate when they do.  You can ask them....you can't demand they accept.", "Honestly? I think you're kind of proving his point. This whole \"I didn't get my way so I'm not coming\" shows me you pull those kind of antics whenever you don't get your way. It sounds like you were (at least to him) the golden child in your parents eyes, or the classic youngest of the family who gets a lot of the spotlight. I say this as an older brother to a middle golden child sister and a younger sister who was very much the baby of the family in a \"look at me\" sense of the term. Both have insisted on things with the same \"or else I won't come\" stunt. The fact he had to ask to be the center of attention for a very momentous occasion says to me he's had previous moments downplayed because of you. Hell, you immediately downplay his feelings in your post without a second to think about it from his side. You come at him combatively not compassionately. It's all about you and what you want. You WANT the spotlight, you don't even try to share. you call his major life news nonsense and his feelings a rant not him pouring out his soul. \n\nMy birthdays were the ones that happened to get work scheduled during, my Xmas gifts always were less than my sisters, their concerts or recitals  or games always took precedent over mine. I learned to not expect gifts that I actually wanted, and to just accept being second fiddle to whatever my sisters were doing. I get where he is coming from. You've known her 10 months, haven't even had a year anniversary, vs YEARS of miscarriages (NOT failures, Jesus it's a human life not a drivers test). There will be other holidays. She can get time off well in advance for another gathering. YTA.", "Info: If you are being honest with yourself is there any truth to what your brother said about you being an attention hog.", "NTA. Totally stay home with your gf and enjoy the holidays without having to walk on eggshells, terrified you'll be stealing someone's attention. I don't like people like that (It's MY turn for attention!!! Wah!).", "I'm going against the grain here with a slight YTA.\n\nYou've been with your gf for 10 months, which is fantastic, but it's (imo) not long enough to *insist* she come to Christmas. Especially since your family hasn't even met her yet (not even over video call? Come on.) Do you expect her to just sit there doing nothing while everyone else opens presents?\n\nInviting someone to a family event that you are not hosting needs to be done a certain way. You need to *ask* the host well in advance whether it would be okay to invite someone. Then, you need to be okY with their answer.\n\nAlso, it sounds like your brother has a chip on his shoulder as far as you're concerned. Whether his complaints about feeling invisible have any validity, I don't know, but clearly, he has always felt upstaged by you. And he has important news to share, so I understand why he'd feel like you'd overshadow him if you brought a partner home for the first time.\n\nObviously you don't have to go to Christmas if you don't want to, but this is a stupid reason, and you're being dramatic.", "NTA\n\nChristmas isn't supposed to be a spotlight on any particular family member.", "NTA but I suggest that you have a proper talk with your brother and parent; maybe there's just a big miscommunication going on here.", "NTA this isn't petty. Petty means unimportant or trivial, and this isn't unimportant to you. Rita taking time off is a big hassle but she made the effort. You rarely get to see your family and tried to make effort. It's not trivial.\n\nI would not go home either but I would maybe (at another time when tempers have cooled) dig into why your brother feels overshadowed by you. This is what you two should work on in general IMO.", "There\u2019s more than you are putting in the post. What kind of stuff was he allowed to do in school? Or were you the only one allowed extracurriculars?", "Yta  you asked to bring a guest, was told no, and are now throwing a temper tantrum. \n\nIf you don't get your way, you won't do it at all!   That'll show your brother that *you're* not the one causing drama /s\n\n*Does* Rita even give a shit?  Maybe she'd like to relax on her few days off.", "NTA, don't want to meet my significant other? Fine then you don't get to see me. I've cut off family that didn't want to meet my wife, \"it's important to me, if it isn't to you, that's your choice.\"\n\nI wouldn't go either, fuck 'em.  \n\n\nAnd just adding to this as I am one of 6 siblings, some are complete bums and some are successful, it's not my fault if my achievements overshadow yours. His only achievement is the fact he can fuck, slow clap for the winner over here (/s)", "NTA\n\nIf you're not welcome then there's no reason to force yourself", "After all this, even if your family agreed that Rita could come, do you really think this is now the best way to introduce Rita to your family?\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s your parents\u2019 event and you don\u2019t have to attend it. \n\nINFO: can your parents travel to meet Rita? Does your brother have a point about attention on you and feeling invisible? Did Emily ever attend Christmas as Charlie\u2019s partner in the early stages of their relationship? Have you expressed your joy about Charlie and Emily\u2019s conception? \n\n(On that note, it wasn\u2019t your question, but YTA for \u201cfailures\u201d. Attempts at conception? Miscarriages? Both? Failures is an awfully dismissive word choice, and makes me wonder how much empathy you\u2019ve had for their struggles.)", "NTA \n\nBoth you AND Rita would have a miserable time if just you went. Just go have fun with Rita. \n\nPlus, as a bonus, that way all of the attention will on your brother\u2019s family! \n\nHowever, Rita will never forget how your family treated her and future get togethers will be much more tense than the would\u2019ve been.\n\nAnd your mom calling you petty is definitely like the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nThat said, your brother\u2019s comment about wanting their attention does imply you were likely the golden child that your parents doted on - maybe as their little princess? He\u2019s 10 years older, so he may have seen and felt like you took his parent\u2019s time and attention away from him. Especially if he had to babysit you sometimes. Not your fault or your problem, but it would explain your brother\u2019s ridiculous demands.", "NTA Maybe ask your mother and father to come visit you in the springtime or summer\u2014that way you won\u2019t be \u201cstealing\u201d ANY attention from your brother\u2026", "Nta", "NAH.
