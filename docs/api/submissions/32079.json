Thanj you for taking the time to read this.\n\nI (25F) have been with my girlfriend (Rita - 27F) for 10 months. I've always known I was bi, but for a long time, I used to date casually. So in a sense this is my first serious and healthy relationship, and the only time I fell head over heels in love with someone.\n\nI live in a different state than all of my other family members and my job is very demanding so I don't really get to see them much throughout the year. I would like to introduce Rita to my family, and since my mom hosts us all for Christmas, I thought maybe that would be a good time. Also, while I did somerimes talk to my family about my previous parrners, I never brought anyone home. So for me, to feel like this is a huge deal.\n\nI even asked Rita to keep her schedule clear for a few days at that time (which is extremely hard for her because she's a medical resident and she rarely gets to be off for that long). When I told my parents that I would like to do that, they said Christmas was for family members only, and that my brother (Charlie - 35M) and his wife (Emily - 32F) are finally expecting a baby after several failures over years, and that he told my parents multiple times that he would like the entire attention to be on them, not me, for once.\n\nI argued that I literally had no other time available for me or Rita to travel, and that I was serious about her and she may end up being family sooner than they think. My parents didn't agree. So I called Charlie and asked her about this nonsense. He went on a 15 minute rant saying he felt he was invisible when I came around and would like to share this huge moment in his life and I would be a huge AH bringing a girl home for the first time ever and overshadowing him.\n\nIt escalated into an argument, and I hung up saying I'm too tired to have this conversation now and we'd talk later. So I called my mother and said I won't be coming home for Christmas if Rita isn't coming, because I don't want to leave her alone for the holidays. My mother told me I was being petty because Rita couldn't care less about this (she is Jewish).\n\nI said I was giving my brother all the spotlight in the world. I got several messages from Charles after this saying it would create even more drama.

Unfortunately parents often have children that they favor more than the other intentionally and unintentionally and makes things more complicated in the sibling relationships as adults. I\u2019m not saying this is the case or accusing anyone but I will say that your brothers feelings of wanting to be seen more could be fine if that\u2019s the case. Regardless this is no doing of your own and it sounds like this is a new sudden rule they just through out there so you not wanting to go without your girlfriend is also very valid. You aren\u2019t being petty, you want to spend time with your gf for the holidays and this will be your first holiday season together as a couple.", "NTA. Let them spend all their attention on your brother, since that's what they explicitly want. Enjoy your time off with your girlfriend!", "NTA\n\nI always like the view that family is not only blood-related people, but also important people close to you (and sometimes even animals like dogs/cats or smth). Like Emily, she isn't blood-related either but apparently still considered family. So if you're serious about Rita, how is that any different? Imo it is exactly the same, so Rita is as much family as Emily is.\n\nThat being said: Seems like they have decided that ur an ass either way. If you bring Rita you take all the spotlight, whatever that means, if you don't bring her you a) leave Rita alone and b) every comment will be held against you like \"ur just acting like that bc you couldnt bring Rita), and if you don't go it \"creates drama\" as well (whatever that means).\n\nChristmas nowadays is way more than a christian festival (atleast imo). There are lots of people that celebrate it that aren't christian, so making the argument that she won't care anyway cuz she's jewish is just wrong without actually asking her (I mean maybe its true, but its bad to just assume it).\n\nImo, sticking with Rita is the best approach. Shows that you're actually serious about her, and also removes yourself from any drama (cuz if it creates drama at ur familys christmas party - you aren't there, so doesnt affect you as much).", "NTA...You're not being petty. Your parents are being petty with their family only rule,  which seems to serve no purpose other than keeping your girlfriend away.

Because all you would be doing is making a pretty awkward moment when your family does meet your girlfriend.  \n\nI get you're excited for them to meet her but at the same time you shouldn't feel you get to dictate when they do.  You can ask them....you can't demand they accept.", "Honestly? I think you're kind of proving his point. This whole \"I didn't get my way so I'm not coming\" shows me you pull those kind of antics whenever you don't get your way. It sounds like you were (at least to him) the golden child in your parents eyes, or the classic youngest of the family who gets a lot of the spotlight. I say this as an older brother to a middle golden child sister and a younger sister who was very much the baby of the family in a \"look at me\" sense of the term. Both have insisted on things with the same \"or else I won't come\" stunt. The fact he had to ask to be the center of attention for a very momentous occasion says to me he's had previous moments downplayed because of you. Hell, you immediately downplay his feelings in your post without a second to think about it from his side. You come at him combatively not compassionately. It's all about you and what you want. You WANT the spotlight, you don't even try to share. you call his major life news nonsense and his feelings a rant not him pouring out his soul. \n\nMy birthdays were the ones that happened to get work scheduled during, my Xmas gifts always were less than my sisters, their concerts or recitals  or games always took precedent over mine. I learned to not expect gifts that I actually wanted, and to just accept being second fiddle to whatever my sisters were doing. I get where he is coming from. You've known her 10 months, haven't even had a year anniversary, vs YEARS of miscarriages (NOT failures, Jesus it's a human life not a drivers test). There will be other holidays. She can get time off well in advance for another gathering. YTA.", "Info: If you are being honest with yourself is there any truth to what your brother said about you being an attention hog.", "NTA.

Wah!).", "I'm going against the grain here with a slight YTA.\n\nYou've been with your gf for 10 months, which is fantastic, but it's (imo) not long enough to *insist* she come to Christmas. Especially since your family hasn't even met her yet (not even over video call? Come on.) Do you expect her to just sit there doing nothing while everyone else opens presents?\n\nInviting someone to a family event that you are not hosting needs to be done a certain way. You need to *ask* the host well in advance whether it would be okay to invite someone. Then, you need to be okY with their answer.\n\nAlso, it sounds like your brother has a chip on his shoulder as far as you're concerned. Whether his complaints about feeling invisible have any validity, I don't know, but clearly, he has always felt upstaged by you. And he has important news to share, so I understand why he'd feel like you'd overshadow him if you brought a partner home for the first time.\n\nObviously you don't have to go to Christmas if you don't want to, but this is a stupid reason, and you're being dramatic.", "NTA\n\nChristmas isn't supposed to be a spotlight on any particular family member.", "NTA but I suggest that you have a proper talk with your brother and parent; maybe there's just a big miscommunication going on here.", "NTA this isn't petty. Petty means unimportant or trivial, and this isn't unimportant to you. Rita taking time off is a big hassle but she made the effort. You rarely get to see your family and tried to make effort.

Does your brother have a point about attention on you and feeling invisible? Did Emily ever attend Christmas as Charlie\u2019s partner in the early stages of their relationship? Have you expressed your joy about Charlie and Emily\u2019s conception? \n\n(On that note, it wasn\u2019t your question, but YTA for \u201cfailures\u201d. Attempts at conception? Miscarriages? Both?

He\u2019s 10 years older, so he may have seen and felt like you took his parent\u2019s time and attention away from him. Especially if he had to babysit you sometimes.

She came over all the time. They got engaged when he was 24. Then she started coming over for Christmas too, even before being officially married. However, the key difference is my brother lived in the same town. I don't.", "Truer words have never been spoken.\n\nIntroducing new partners during major holidays is rather iffy aswell.", "It is Christmas though, if they want to celebrate the pregnancy (rightfully so) then have a celebration for that. Don't go around gate keeping Christmas.\n\nAlso, if the parents are favouring one child over the other that makes the parents TA not OP. Charlie should be having these conversations with his parents instead of punishing OP for simply existing.", "As I\u2019m reading I\u2019m thinking the exact same thing. OP definitely eats up all the attention. \nYTA", "This is the kind of thing that will follow OPs family for a long time.  When my wife and I were first dating her mom pulled the \"Can't come unless FaMiLy\", and graciously allowed me to pick her up and spend some time after all the festivities had finished.  Wife didn't live with her mom (she lived with her dad, parents divorced) and we were both legal adults and out of school. Mommy dearest then complained to wife later on that I didn't spend any time with them and we left shortly after I got there and why didn't I want to visit?\n\nThat will be 20 years ago next month and it was definitely a sign of how things would go with her mom moving forward.  We're low contact currently.", "> Also, why would you want \"Christmas\" to be when you introduce someone, whether you're serious about them or not?  That seems like it would just add extra stress and pressure on everyone.  I'm not saying that this is or isn't a hill worth dying on...but why is Christmas the time to do this?\n\nOP lives in another state, and Rita has a job that doesn't allow for a lot of time off.  Holidays in general are a convenient time to do the infrequent trips.  It's a predetermined date that many workers already have off.  It's also an easy way to get a mass introduction done since everyone is already together.", "How many girlfriends has he brought over the years?  How long were him and his wife together before she came to Christmas?  Feels like the family is hoping her first real relationship will fall apart by the following year and the the brothers pregnancy is a handy excuse to not say \"you're not bringing the gay into the house\" as they hope OP maybe dates an acceptable male the following year.", "OP has had many holidays with her family, this is her first holiday with Rita.  Even if they don't do Christmas together, they could do a mix of each other's traditions, or OP could partake of Rita's Hanukkah traditions.  Or they could start their own traditions.  \n\nAlso, this \"Family Only\" seems to have taken OP by surprise so it's not like it's a longstanding tradition and there was reasonable belief that OP could have brought their serious SO without it being an event.  Op isn't obligated to attend, and if the restrictions on attendance mean OP doesn't go, that's a perfectly fine decision.  NTA", "Does he live close to your parents? If so it\u2019s pretty common for the out of state sibling to get more spotlight when they come to visit.", "I can see where you have some golden child aura where your brother's successes seem more mundane.  I am not saying you consider them less, but I can see where he feels they are considered less noteworthy.  This adds to my belief that you should support his success for this holiday season.", "YTA. Sounds like you're the golden child and not getting your way for once.", "I think the difference is the need to travel.  It\u2019s not like they can go by after work.  It seems ridiculous to require them to travel to a different state so you can introduce them so they are allowed to travel there for Christmas.", "Not to mention OP has basically been told they are expected to just sit there and not do anything but give attention to Charlie and also had to receive an earful from her whole family. Christmas sounds like it will be a shitty day this year.", "I can understand that too\u2026", "Of course she's not obligated to attend. It's her ultimatum I had a problem with.", "Yes they even live in the same neighbourhood", "If OP were the golden child the parents wouldn\u2019t be asking her to not bring Rita. Certainly her brother might ask her not to, but the parents would prioritize OP over all else if OP were indeed the golden child.", "Lol source? Not in my experience. In my experience the pregnant scapegoat was told \"don't make a big deal of your pregnancy, your older sister is at the end of her pregnancy\" despite gc being in another state and the sg being in their state. Then when gc got pregnant at the end of the sg pregnancy, it was very \"what sg?\"", ">  Still a guest.   \n    \nThe OP is the only one that can make that definition.  They are in a relationship, this is their partner, mom, dad, Charlie, none of them get to define the relationship.    \n     \n>  but its vitally important that she be introduced at Christmas?   \n    \nIf it is important to OP, it is important.  This is their relationship, this was an opportunity to introduce the family to someone that is important and has a huge place in the OP's life.  And mom shit on it.  Was it vitally important for mom to exclude the significant partner of one of her children.  No, but she did.   \n    \nI would find it personally insulting enough that the last Christmas I spent with them would be the last one they ever saw me.  Insult my SO, you insult me.  Exclude her, you exclude me.  And if you exclude me once, why the hell would I put myself out there for you again?", "Frankly, I don't even see it as an ultimatum, just facts.  Op wants to spend the holidays with Rita first, family second.  Family says Rita can't come, so OP says fine, I'll spend them with Rita.  It's a package deal, family gets both or none because Rita is important to OP.  That's not an ultimatum, just informing the family that their choices have consequences.", "Hate to break it to him, but you\u2019re going to be getting a \u201cspotlight\u201d any time you come visit. That\u2019s just how it is. I live about 5 minutes from my parents\u2019 house and we have dinner together most Saturdays. My sister still lives in town but on the other end of the city, and comes over much less frequently, so she tends to get more attention. When you don\u2019t see someone as often it\u2019s just natural to be more interested in catching up with them than it is with someone you see frequently.", "100% agree with you. I've seen that happen over and over over the years. A shitty toxic Golden child's demands/wants always trump a grandchild's needs.", "I'm not even saying it never happens that a grandchild might upset the 'normal' system and the golden child is set aside for the sake of the grandchild, but I very very much doubt that is 'usual' or even happens often. I could be wrong (but I'd like some proof, even anecdotal)."]}
