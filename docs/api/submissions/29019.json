{"id": 29019, "submission_id": "1790cfo", "title": "AITA for not accepting my boyfriend\u2019s \u201cGerman-ness\u201d?", "selftext": " I (20F) have been together with my boyfriend (22M) for about a year and a half. For some context I am a Japanese-born American, and my bf is German. \n\nThe issue first started when we were getting to know each other. We would send each other songs we both really liked, and would give our own opinion on said songs. When faced with a specific song he disliked, he said that it was \u201ctrash and disgusting\u201d and no one should be listening to it. It was certainly whiplash for me to hear such harsh things about a song I was nostalgic about, so I contested. It is totally fine to have different tastes in music, I clarified, but I believed his statement to be a bit harsh. He then proceeded to completely disregard my argument, and said it\u2019s simply because he is German.  \n\nThe German people are known for being quite blunt, he further noted. He also added that if I wanted him to be dishonest, he would lie to my face if that is what I prefer. I thought there were some sense in his words, and although I was still bothered by it, I told him it was just quite a culture shock. I began to try to look past it from then on. \n\nFor the entirety of the length of our relationship, his \u201cGerman bluntness\u201d never stopped. He would insult everything from my hobbies, the games I play, how I carry myself, right down to the way I dress. He made sure his opinion is ingrained in my head by always saying I have a shit sense of fashion, or that it\u2019s embarrassing that I am so fidgety when I have to socialize with new people. I have to be honest, it truly got to me after awhile. I tried my hardest to just suck it up, and see his honesty as a good trait. But I honestly started feeling like he was more of a bully than my boyfriend. \n\nFast forward to last week. He told me that I seemed quite distant, and that I never share the things I like with him anymore. That\u2019s when it became too much for me, I suppose. I went on a tangent and told him that I became afraid of his judgement on the things that makes me, me. I told him I can\u2019t tolerate his \u201cGerman-ness\u201d anymore, and that I am unhappy. He audibly gasped, and said that he never stopped me from doing things I enjoy. He just gave his VERY honest opinion on it. \n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, he said that how come he could tolerate my \u201cJapanese qualities\u201d (by this he refers to how I eat most of my meals with chopsticks, and I celebrate certain traditional holidays that the typical westerner wouldn\u2019t), but I can\u2019t love and accept him for being German. I just told him that no way in hell are those the same things. He then sarcastically said sorry for being himself, and just ended the argument there. \n\nSince then, his parents have reached out to me and confirmed that the German people are indeed just very blunt, and his actions did not deviate from that. My boyfriend, however, have been barely contacting me at all. I\u2019m starting to think that I\u2019m purely ignorant, and that he only means well. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: People are calling me a white d!ck rider, and to be frank outside of this situation race isn\u2019t relevant to who I choose to be with. I\u2019m not some dumb, naive, and sheltered Asian girl that worships white dudes. Just stop. You are the problem. \n\nEdit 2: I really appreciate all the Germans chiming in with their perspective on the situation. I honestly just need that final push to end it with him.\n\nEdit 3: Lots of people began suspecting him of being a wannabe German, and I regret to inform you that he indeed is born in Germany and lived there for the first 19 years of his life.\n\nFinal edit: I broke up with him as of an hour ago. I know it looks like I\u2019ve ignored a sea of red flags, but of course he wasn\u2019t a berating machine 24/7 and actually was capable of complimenting and being nice to me sometimes (believe it or not). I shouldn\u2019t have held on as long as I have though, and deep down I knew it was some shitty ass excuse that he\u2019s just acting \u201cGerman\u201d. Thank you for confirming my suspicions, and for all your advice and perspectives. They truly opened my eyes and made me come my senses. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to give too much bias into the post and include my personal feelings, but I am as baffled as you all are. I\u2019ve tried to break it off with him in the past, but every time it ended in him threatening suicide.

Yes German people can be blunt, but this isn\u2019t him being blunt this is him being abusive and vile. And his parents are no better. Leave him.

And his parents are enabling it. \n\nEspecially as he is dating someone who is not German and is maybe even living outside Germany even he should've learned to be more considerate and polite around others. Polite is something that is possible albeit not natural to many Germans. His behaviour would be regarded as harsh from many Germans as well. \n\nWhen I lived in the US for a short while I never told anybody anything like your BF did with you. Knowing Germans are oftentimes too blunt I just asked when in doubt \"do you want an brutal honest opinion, do you want a nice answer, do you only want to smalltalk?\". For me it was just joking to break the ice. Oftentimes people only wanted smalltalk. Rarely they wanted the brutal opinion. And nope I did not do this always. \n\nSo as we Germans are very aware that others can't cope with our brutal honest opinions often we also can adjust. Your BF plays the \"I'm only honest\"-card which translates to \"I'm disguising my AH behaviour as honesty and think I can get away with it that way.\" \n\nHe's just a d!ck.

There is an important difference between being \"German blunt\" and an outright offensive asshole. He is trying to keep you down and break your sense of confidence and gaslighting you. This is a toxic and disrespectful relationship at best and he is justifying his shitty behaviour with \"being German\" plus being enabled by his also asshole parents. Run, girl and never look back. It will only get worse from here.\nEdit: typos", "NTA.\n\nGerman here. There is still a difference between being an ass an being a german. We are blunt and direct.

But these are accidents, not a pattern).\n\nFor example: when a friend of you tries a dress and she looks thick in it, an american (tends to) say: \"it does not match your eye\" or some code like that. A blunt german says: \"it makes you look thick.\" We dont say \"you look fat\", and if someone does, the other person is right to be angry. \n\nSo It might be he is just a dick and trues to hide it by trying to tell you it is german. German bluntness is a bit more complicated than that. \nHe also sounds like a gaslighter when he compares insulting you to you eating with chopsticks. \n\nGenerally, having a relationship bridging different cultures requires some work and compromises i would say.

No matter what we were talking about he allways would contradict everything I said.\n\nWhen I said I liked movie X he would rant how bad it is, when I say the sky is blue he would tell me that it is actually more of a turqoise color.\n\nI think for him it is kind of a mentally challenge to discuss with me but as you described it the other person slowly starts to stop telling things that make them happy with this person.\n\nEventually I just agreed to everything he said just to make him shut up.

There is no overlap there.", "Yea, being blunt and rude like that is not a German trait.\nHe is controlling and manipulative that gaslights you when he makes these offensive comments.\nBut even if we accept that this is a  ' cultural' thing, there is no reason to prefer his culture to yours, where insults are not a regular way to communicate.

This guy is just a bully", "NTA, but why and how did you ever agree to a relationship in the first place with someone like that?", "Uhm, no. I'm german. Germans are not blunt. They are way more direct that others and also their way of showing affection, interest, or joy seems different especially to Americans who tend to be super outgoing and extroverted. They seem more quiet and their reactions to anything will be less exaggerated. Some older people might also flat out tell you when they think that things you enjoy or efforts you made for them were super unnecessary, which is not very nice. (But I feel like Americans don't differ much, only Germans will look grumpy and muffle a few sentences, while Americans wave at you and loudly dismiss you).\n\n'Bluntness' is only used to describe this directness. However, calling something shitty or not worth listening to is simply not part of that. A stereotypical german would simply say that it does not match their taste. That alone is quite rude in other countries. But using blunt phrases or even shit talking what you like has nothing to do with being german. Your bf would be considered a super rude, uncomfortable person here, too.\n\nAlso. It's an older people thing. Like the grumpy grandpa kind of thing. If your bf is under 60, excusing himself with being german is super cringe and also kind of concerning. He does not sound like he reflects himself at all or is open minded towards a normal social life. Also, no german would act rude and say it's because they're german. We don't feel rude, our way of talking seems normal to us and we consider ourselves welcoming - for someone who had little contact to foreigners, it would actually come as a shock that we are considered rude.

For some context I am a Japanese-born American, and my bf is German. \n\nThe issue first started when we were getting to know each other. We would send each other songs we both really liked, and would give our own opinion on said songs. When faced with a specific song he disliked, he said that it was \u201ctrash and disgusting\u201d and no one should be listening to it. It was certainly whiplash for me to hear such harsh things about a song I was nostalgic about, so I contested. It is totally fine to have different tastes in music, I clarified, but I believed his statement to be a bit harsh. He then proceeded to completely disregard my argument, and said it\u2019s simply because he is German.  \n\nThe German people are known for being quite blunt, he further noted. He also added that if I wanted him to be dishonest, he would lie to my face if that is what I prefer. I thought there were some sense in his words, and although I was still bothered by it, I told him it was just quite a culture shock. I began to try to look past it from then on. \n\nFor the entirety of the length of our relationship, his \u201cGerman bluntness\u201d never stopped. He would insult everything from my hobbies, the games I play, how I carry myself, right down to the way I dress. He made sure his opinion is ingrained in my head by always saying I have a shit sense of fashion, or that it\u2019s embarrassing that I am so fidgety when I have socialize with new people. I have to be honest, it truly got to me after awhile. I tried my hardest to just suck it up, and see his honesty as a good trait. But I honestly started feeling like he was more of a bully than my boyfriend. \n\nFast forward to last week. He told me that I seemed quite distant, and that I never share the things I like with him anymore. That\u2019s when it became too much for me, I suppose. I went on a tangent and told him that I became afraid of his judgement on the things that makes me, me. I told him I can\u2019t tolerate his \u201cGerman-ness\u201d anymore, and that I am unhappy. He audibly gasped, and said that he never stopped me from doing things I enjoy. He just gave his VERY honest opinion on it. \n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, he said that how come he could tolerate my \u201cJapanese qualities\u201d (by this he refers to how I eat most of my meals with chopsticks, and I celebrate certain traditional holidays that the typical westerner wouldn\u2019t), but I can\u2019t love and accept him for being German. I just told him that no way in hell are those the same things. He then sarcastically said sorry for being himself, and just ended the argument there. \n\nSince then, his parents have reached out to me and confirmed that the German people are indeed just very blunt, and his actions did not deviate from that. My boyfriend, however, have been barely contacting me at all. I\u2019m starting to think that I\u2019m purely ignorant, and that he only means well.
