My MIL has been horrified every time he made that suggestion and shoots it down. \n\nMy husband is very picky and doesn\u2019t like to repeat certain dishes in quick succession of each other (eating the same dish twice in a month or so). So when I made a casserole my husband really liked for Thanksgiving, my MIL asked that I make it again for Christmas, because she was making stuffed cabbage for Christmas and my husband doesn\u2019t eat that. At the time, I didn\u2019t realize what I was saying and said sure. Last week we saw my in-laws at a party and my MIL wanted to confirm I was bringing the casserole. I predicted my husband wouldn\u2019t want that since I just made it for Thanksgiving and he confirmed it. He said he would just bring a frozen pizza with him for dinner. My MIL protested right away and turned to me to ask why I couldn\u2019t just make it and my husband only reacted that way because I protested against making it. I clarified that wasn\u2019t that case. In fact, I had everything at home to make it but he hadn\u2019t wanted it lately. She said I couldn\u2019t let him eat frozen pizza on Christmas so I told her I was sure he would want something else by then.  I told him, whatever he wanted for Christmas, I\u2019d make for him and he said he would let me know but he didn\u2019t see the big deal with the pizza idea. Well, today he came home with the frozen pizza he\u2019s taking over to my in-laws. I sent a message to my MIL and she asked how I could let him do that and she didn\u2019t understand what kind of wife wouldn\u2019t make something special for her husband on Christmas. It seems she wants me to feel bad, but it\u2019s what he wants, why should I tell him no? AITA here?\n\nEDIT: To clarify: It\u2019s not a big Christmas dinner. It\u2019s just the 4 of us. Making the casserole doesn\u2019t make sense since the three of us (my in-laws and I) would be eating the stuffed cabbage and the mashed potatoes she always makes with it, so the casserole would probably go untouched.", "created_utc": 1671907754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zug1m3/aita_for_letting_my_husband_eat_frozen_pizza_for/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
