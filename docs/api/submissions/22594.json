I'm here with an update at her suggestion.\n\nThe Good:\n\nA year later she's a year into an Engineering degree, she's been playing lots of hockey, raised a couple of steers all on her own and at her therapists recommendation she's down to monthly sessions after a brief stop at bi-weekly after starting with weekly.\n\nShe's the same sweet kid but without the extra unneeded stress of being treated like an \"also ran\" alongside her younger siblings.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nHer dad showed up about a month after my original post and there was a confrontation of sorts that ended with a peace bond being issued with restrictions on how Bill and Tanya could contact Alice, myself, my missus or a couple other family members that got involved. After the 6 months required by the peace bond, Tanya started getting back up to her old tricks but Bill seems to have smartened up a bit.\n\nThe peace bond meant she has had limited contact with her siblings which has been tough. The oldest (15M) started out pretty hosting but some of the other cousins filled him in on what was going on (I got blamed for his sudden shift in attitude, because we've established that I am just the worst with jazz hands and everything)\n\nThe Silly:\n\nGossipy family mellowed out when they realized that the literal gravy train wasn't going to stop at the station for them. Thanksgiving last year was 26 people compared to the 60+ that came the last year I threw it prior to COVID restrictions. Easter this year was back up to an even 40 so we're probably going to plateau a little short of the old numbers.\n\nAs for resolution to the problem, Bill has been texting Alice every couple of days to check in. They've gone for coffee a few times after the peace bond expired. \"I'd go to his funeral but not his birthday party\" were Alice's words when I asked her about where they're at. I'm hoping time can heal that wound but she's been really good at setting boundaries.\n\nTo quote one of the great warrior poets of our time, John Cougar Mellencamp, life goes on.\n\nI'll answer questions if it's allowed, otherwise, here's some closure guys.", "created_utc": 1689714805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153alim/update_aita_for_taking_in_my_problem_cousin_and/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Not All Heros Wear capes!

You are your wife are seriously good people, and should not have had to endure the criticism from the extended family. As someone else pointed out on the other post, Bill & Tanya just didn't want their mistreatment of Alice to be exposed by her \"behaving\" after being treated like an actual human being.
