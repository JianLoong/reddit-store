I'm here with an update at her suggestion.\n\nThe Good:\n\nA year later she's a year into an Engineering degree, she's been playing lots of hockey, raised a couple of steers all on her own and at her therapists recommendation she's down to monthly sessions after a brief stop at bi-weekly after starting with weekly.\n\nShe's the same sweet kid but without the extra unneeded stress of being treated like an \"also ran\" alongside her younger siblings.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nHer dad showed up about a month after my original post and there was a confrontation of sorts that ended with a peace bond being issued with restrictions on how Bill and Tanya could contact Alice, myself, my missus or a couple other family members that got involved. After the 6 months required by the peace bond, Tanya started getting back up to her old tricks but Bill seems to have smartened up a bit.\n\nThe peace bond meant she has had limited contact with her siblings which has been tough. The oldest (15M) started out pretty hostile but some of the other cousins filled him in on what was going on (I got blamed for his sudden shift in attitude, because we've established that I am just the worst with jazz hands and everything)\n\nThe Silly:\n\nGossipy family mellowed out when they realized that the literal gravy train wasn't going to stop at the station for them. Thanksgiving last year was 26 people compared to the 60+ that came the last year I threw it prior to COVID restrictions. Easter this year was back up to an even 40 so we're probably going to plateau a little short of the old numbers.\n\nAs for resolution to the problem, Bill has been texting Alice every couple of days to check in. They've gone for coffee a few times after the peace bond expired. \"I'd go to his funeral but not his birthday party\" were Alice's words when I asked her about where they're at. I'm hoping time can heal that wound but she's been really good at setting boundaries.\n\nTo quote one of the great warrior poets of our time, John Cougar Mellencamp, life goes on.\n\nI'll answer questions if it's allowed, otherwise, here's some closure guys.  \n\n\nEdit was to fix spelling.", "created_utc": 1689714805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153alim/update_aita_for_taking_in_my_problem_cousin_and/", "score": 2767, "replies": ["Not All Heros Wear capes!

Like they haven't done worse stuff to her throughout her childhood. I feel bad for her real mother as well.\n\nNow op,\nYou are such a sweet lovely person I would have hugged you and kissed your hands if we met in real life. You are an angel and never change for anything or anyone. You are one the last of a rare species. It has been simping since I saw someone like you online. Don't regret even if that girl doesn't have a good life or respect you in the future. Don't hurt her. Just remain  the angel that you are. Your wife is an angel too for letting  you  do this.", "I hope Bill doesn't manipulate Alice into accepting them after which they can emotionally abuse her even further.

I hope you and your wife are proud of yourselves (and of Alice) because you should be.

Their expectations were simply that we were doing something with our lives (working, studying, just something). If they had threatened to throw any of us out, I would have gone full no-contact. It's such bullshit that some people think that once a child turns 18, they're no longer your responsibility. You are a parent until the day you die, in one way or another. Kick me out at 18, and I'm not finding you a nursing home.", "I\u2019ve had a recent falling out with a friend who\u2019s seriously unwell, but has now completely unchained his lifelong vindictive arse behaviour and  let it run loose.

So there\u2019s a bar they were able to get over without stumbling. You don\u2019t mention if Alice was kept away from her brothers as much as possible or if she was the main babysitter for them.

(Just read the original now) the most hurtful thing was the fact that she was continuously excluded from her \u201cfamily\u201d. If I were Alice I would\u2019ve cut ties as soon as I was 18. I wouldn\u2019t bother having a relationship with my \u201cdad\u201d he didn\u2019t want one with me all those years.

This is wild. Not content with neglecting her for most of her life and kicking her out on her 18th birthday, they also wanted to ensure that her future was a hard as possible. What absolute scummy people. Well done for taking Alice in and ignoring the vile family members who wanted to see her as destitute as possible. I really hope that she finishes her degree and has a really bright future.", "My heart still breaks for Alice. She sounds like a wonderful young woman and she has a bright future ahead of her thanks to your support.   \nI grew up with a shitty dad and it has scared me for life. He is dead now, I didn't go to his funeral and I never went to his grave. I know what Alice is feeling now.  She will never trust Bill again and she shouldn't. He will only let her down again.   \nBig hugs to you and your wife. You are fantastic people and please don't underestimate what you are doing for Alice. Even when she has a bad mood, she knows she is safe with you and that you will not let her down. You are her rock, her anker, her shoulder to lean on. Kuddos to you also for not taking the crap from the family. You stand your ground and it's separating the wheat from the chaff, if you understand what I mean.", "What a bas**** to abuse his child because he has produced some new replacement children. If I were Tanya I hope she realizes that if anything happened to her, Bill will discard and abuse their children as easily as he did Alice, and she can only hope that in such a situation, their new stepmother isn\u2019t a bi*** like she is.\n\nI wonder if the cousins who wanted OP to throw Alice away wanted to be able to threaten to throw away their own children who are getting older and seeing independence as an option.", "Love it!  She sounds like one very bright cookie. Thank all the powers that be for you and your wife. Too many unhappy people in the world.

Just like football being played with feet, not hands...", "Yes, even \u201cmad, bad and dangerous to know\u201d Byron was not able to openly admit that he made his new wife to take in his pregnant sister just because he was the father. I don\u2019t think that can be admitted anywhere at anytime. If I remember right, wife showed the proof to his doctors?", "This was 1815, what proof?", "Then again: she was able to fully separate from her husband. She had to have some really damaging evidence!", "Very hazy memories, I was reading about this some time ago. I think it was letters between Byron and sister? It was something written on paper because she was able to take it with her when she escaped", "Given that her husband never questioned the child's paternity, I'm not sure any of them were right. (Well, I guess one of them must have been, but you know what I mean).\n\nAnd I guess \"ran off with her (half?) sister's husband\" is about as much an unkind stereotype as \"became a gambling addict\", so the joke works either way..."]}
