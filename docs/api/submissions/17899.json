This is very childish of her not to realize.", "NTA, she wasn't even listening to you. Sorry that happened... Good luck!!", "NTA. Girls snapping her gum at you while you\u2019re trying to work! The hypocrisy\u2026", "NTA - she should be able to differentiate between when you're working and when you aren't. Maybe she's lonely or just struggles with boundaries, but it's something she needs to learn to respect or it's going to cause issues between you. Did you two recently move in together or did you recently start working from home? What has changed? If it's just her and her respect for boundaries, then maybe something is wrong. It reminds me of how my dad was as his dementia progressed, he had more and more trouble understanding boundaries and why I didn't want to be disturbed at times or why it wasn't okay to just open my door and start talking to me. Losing the ability to understand and respect boundaries can be a sign of mental health issues, so if this is something new, that's something to think about.\n\nDo you hang out in your office when not working? If so, maybe stop doing that so that it becomes \"when I'm in my office I'm working and can't be disturbed.\" Otherwise maybe a sign on the door might help.", "NTA. For some reason people think WFH means you\u2019re not really working and they can bother you or ask you to babysit kids or do chores. Which is ridiculous you\u2019re still working. And of course someone taking out loud in the same room is going to be distracting.", "NTA... working hours is work.... tell her dont  distrub u... lock the door while ur working", "NTA.

I WFH full-time by necessity, as does my wife, in separate office spaces within our home. \nWe understand two ground rules between us:\n\n1. If the door to the space is closed, it\u2019s closed for a reason. Do not disturb (unless there\u2019s been a death in the family - and it better have been yours).\n2. If you wouldn\u2019t pick up the phone to call about something if we weren\u2019t WFH, then don\u2019t bother barging in with it.\n\nHaving had my share of tense moments in the home office, I get it.

My SO and I do this when we're working at home. Then we can focus when we need to or talk a bit when we can.", "Yup. Over the years we've grown sensitive to when the other can and cannot be disturbed, as I expect you two have, but it's easier to have defined spaces and/or times.", "NTA but you're dating a woman who thinks being pretty, fashionable and well groomed is a big priority.  I bet this is something you look for in women.\n\nI often see couples walking down the street.  He is in comfortable shoes and she can only walk at half the speed because she is wearing painful fashionable but high and perhaps too small shoes.  Men want the gf who is a credit to them, the gf other men envy but  then there are consequences.  That kind of person, who is focused on nails / hair / style doesn't just turn it off.  The amount of money she spends on all these treatments to be well styled and groomed, the time she invests, they are all things you benefit from.\n\nYou look for this kind of woman specifically but then judge her for focusing on and prioritising what you find attractive.", "NTA.", "NTA. My husband works from home. If he\u2019s on work hours, I don\u2019t disturb him.

Work.\n\nThe only thing that might blur the lines is if you call out to her or you chat with her throughout the day.  Or ask her for things while you're working.  \nBecause that can lead to the assumption that it is okay to talk to you while you are working if you are able to talk to her if that makes sense.\n\nBecause it goes both ways.", "NTA, tell her, during your off time, that you weren't trying to be an AH but between your work hours (not lunch or breaks) that you can't be disturbed because you ARE WORKING. It's not that difficult to be respectful of someone trying to do their job. She was being an AH by continually coming in to disturb by talking to herself.", "NTA I'm also working from home currently and have to remind my family on a semi regular basis that just because it looks like I'm only clickity clacking with a podcast going doesn't mean I'm not in flow and if I get interrupted I have to add that time to what should have been the end of my workday.", "NTA.  I work from home and working from home is still working.  In fact, a lot of people work from home to avoid the distractions of the office and constant chatter around them/people interrupting them\n\nClearly there\u2019s some boundary issues there so I would sit down and have a talk with her, put up a Do Not Disturb sign or lock the door if it keeps happening, and then honestly\u2026 rethink if you\u2019re willing be with someone who can\u2019t understand something that literal children do about not disturbing their parents while they\u2019re working from home\n\nDoes she also not work?", "I don't know why you'be made a load of random assumptions tbh. No being fashionable isn't something I look for in a women. You've decided that because my gf showed me an outfit she was planning to wear that I specifically look and expect her to spend a lot of money on treatments and be well styled which is a massive leap to make and it's just incorrect.", "Lol wtf", "Projection, magical thinking and a bunch of stuff you pulled out of your ass. None of that bullshit is contained in or even implied by the text of the opening post. Which, in case you didnt read it, is about working from home and the need to be allowed to concentrate on it.", "Wow, what a weird, non-helpful, judgmental comment. If you're going to offer an opinion, why not stick to the question asked instead of making wild assumptions?", "You made a lot of assumptions about something that wasn't even the topic of the post.

I am fortunate enough to have a job that I can do from anywhere, which I originally thought would afford me the ability to see family more. This idea was dashed the first time I tried to visit my father. I told him my schedule every day: \"I have meetings from 12-2 and 3-5 today so I'm going to be locked in at that point, let's plan around that\", but somehow every time I was in a meeting a knock came on my door and he was \"Just checking in\".\n\nIf I'm going to work from anywhere but my home, I'm going to go and do it all by myself. \n\nNTA", "My daughter was 16 when lockdown started in 2020. It took her about a week to understand that if I was in the boxroom I was at work. She could knock on the door and if I didn't answer she'd go away. Mostly. Occasionally she's heard me laughing and shouted \"you're supposed to be at work, Mum\" which just makes me laugh more.\n\nMy husband was 67.

He has to step over junk to do so, but he makes the effort!", "Did you read an entirely different post than the rest of us??", "Yeah.

He was weird about it for a little bit, and I had to keep reassuring him that I still care about him and the things he\u2019s interested in, but that I cannot get things done when he just interrupts like that.", "I know.

Do you really need a sign to not knock on a door your SO is working behind? I don't really get it. I do, but i don't.", "My hubby and I do this - mainly because we like to make each other cups of tea or make sure the other person has eaten lunch or have a friendly chat etc. The sign is usually on during meetings (my husband installed a light system by the door).", "During meetings only already makes much more sense. That i can get behind."]}
