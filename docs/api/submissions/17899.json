She needs to realise that working from home doesn\u2019t mean chilling, you are still busy and need to concentrate.", "NTA - My husband works from home and used to have to remind me to stay out of his office when he\u2019s concentrating. It\u2019s an easy thing to forget when someone\u2019s always available for chatting but suddenly needs to go heads down in their work. He uses red headphones now to let me know he\u2019s too busy to talk, maybe you can have something visual like that for your girlfriend so she knows to leave you alone when you need to concentrate at work.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is very childish of her not to realize.", "NTA, she wasn't even listening to you. Sorry that happened... Good luck!!", "NTA. Girls snapping her gum at you while you\u2019re trying to work! The hypocrisy\u2026", "NTA - she should be able to differentiate between when you're working and when you aren't. Maybe she's lonely or just struggles with boundaries, but it's something she needs to learn to respect or it's going to cause issues between you. Did you two recently move in together or did you recently start working from home? What has changed? If it's just her and her respect for boundaries, then maybe something is wrong. It reminds me of how my dad was as his dementia progressed, he had more and more trouble understanding boundaries and why I didn't want to be disturbed at times or why it wasn't okay to just open my door and start talking to me. Losing the ability to understand and respect boundaries can be a sign of mental health issues, so if this is something new, that's something to think about.\n\nDo you hang out in your office when not working? If so, maybe stop doing that so that it becomes \"when I'm in my office I'm working and can't be disturbed.\" Otherwise maybe a sign on the door might help.", "NTA. For some reason people think WFH means you\u2019re not really working and they can bother you or ask you to babysit kids or do chores. Which is ridiculous you\u2019re still working. And of course someone taking out loud in the same room is going to be distracting.", "NTA... working hours is work.... tell her dont  distrub u... lock the door while ur working", "NTA. I feel like, by this point in time, most people understand that WFH is still work.", "NTA - she doesn't seem to realize it's a privileged position to be able to work from home. And that it's contingent on you actually being able to do your work.", "NTA - work from home is still work.       \nIf you went into the office she wouldn\u2019t be able to visit you and talk crap", "NTA lock the door.", "NTA. I WFH full-time by necessity, as does my wife, in separate office spaces within our home. \nWe understand two ground rules between us:\n\n1. If the door to the space is closed, it\u2019s closed for a reason. Do not disturb (unless there\u2019s been a death in the family - and it better have been yours).\n2. If you wouldn\u2019t pick up the phone to call about something if we weren\u2019t WFH, then don\u2019t bother barging in with it.\n\nHaving had my share of tense moments in the home office, I get it. Working from home implies *working*. The gf needs to comprehend that.", "NTA, even my young kids know better.", "NTA", "I work in the spare bedroom", "Seriously, was she under a rock the last 2-3 years?", "I suggest putting a \"Do not disturb\" notice on it, when you can't be disturbed.  She can talk to you in your scheduled coffee breaks, lunch, and other such 'water cooler' moments.", "Than clearly NTA", "Sounds funny but this does work. My SO and I go this when we're working at home. Then we can focus when we need to or talk a bit when we can.", "Yup. Over the years we've grown sensitive to when the other can and cannot be disturbed, as I expect you two have, but it's easier to have defined spaces and/or times."]}
