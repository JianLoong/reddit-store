We get along fine. \n\nOur mom died when we were 8 and 9 and our dad remarried about three years later. While my step mom isn\u2019t a bad person at all, she\u2019ll never be my mom. Ryan does see her as mom though and eventually stopped talking about our real mom.\n\nHe like completely stopped mentioning her, even on her death anniversary and birthday. Not even dad does that. While I understand that we all grieve differently, it makes me sad sometimes. I know mom\u2019s dead and has no idea, but it still hurts. I don\u2019t say anything though.\n\nRyan had some friends over after one of his baseball games and they were all hyper because they won so I was sitting in my room, just looking through pics of my mom. It was one of those days.\n\nBut one of his friends knocked on my door, then another appeared, then another and then eventually my brother. They were all joking around and I was laughing along because why not. Anyways, the boys came into my room and one of them noticed the pictures I had out of my mom and jokingly asked if Ryan had another sister. I was like \u201cnah that\u2019s our mom.\u201d \n\nThe boys were all confused but Ryan distracted them and they all left the house after a bit.\n\nRyan came back a couple hours later, high as shit btw, and just started yelling at me. He was like \u201cwho gave you the right to talk to my fucking friends\u201d, said I made things real awkward for him and apparently I\u2019m a massive loser for still being hung up on HER. I didn\u2019t really care about his yelling but the fact that he called our mother \u201cher\u201d and was yelling at me for literally nothing pissed me off.\n\nI told him that he could pretend all he wants but \u201cher\u201d is still our mom and while he\u2019s okay with pretending she never existed and treating her like dirt, I\u2019m not. Unlike him, I\u2019m not ashamed of our fucking mom and I\u2019m never going to replace \u201cher\u201d like he did. \n\nHe went \u201cfuck you\u201d and ran to his room. My dad and step mom talked to me after they got home and lectured me about \u201cgrieving differently\u201d and said I went too far. He was literally insulting me for going \u201cnah that\u2019s our mom\u201d\u2026 he never told me I couldn\u2019t tell people and what\u2019s the big fucking deal? Like did it really warrant that big of a reaction? And also he and his friends knocked on my door and talked to me first??? But idk, my dad wants me to apologize and Ryan glares at me every time he sees me now.

He overreacted. No question, and he shouldn't have attacked you the way he did.\n\nIt's hard to judge him as it's clear you both never recovered from your mom's death. Both of you need therapy.\n\nYour dad and your step mom are the ahole for ignoring your feelings and taking your brothers side. \n\nBottom line get therapy. I'm sorry you are going through this.", "NTA\n\nYou're not the one disrespecting someone else's grief here, your brother is. You have every right to talk about your mom, and he has absolutely zero right to try to pretend that you don't have the right to speak honestly to another human being, just because he happens to be friends with them.\n\nHonestly it sounds like your brother may need some therapy around this issue. As that reaction is extremely disproportionate for the circumstances. \n\nAs for your step mom, and dad, I can't say I'm impressed with their stance. Your brother was being belligerent, controlling, and abusive, while also disrespecting your grief, and their response is to tell you that you're the problem? That is just straight up gaslighting, and it's abusive.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your father, and step mom are just enabling his unhealthy behaviour, because it's easier for them than addressing the uncomfortable reality that you are allowed to still see your mother, as your mother. \n\nY'all need some serious family therapy, because their responses are incredibly toxic.", "NTA, but this is probably beyond Reddit.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYour dad and stepmom need to have a serious conversation with Ryan and maybe get him some additional help.", "NTA \n\nFirst of all, you made things awkward by being in your own room? They're the ones who interacted with you first. Not only to mention that you totally have the right to grieve. If he doesn't care about it that's one thing but he should not get mad at you for acting how most people would act after they lose their mom.", "NTA and he needs therapy", "NTA\n\nSounds like you really hit a nerve. It could be that your brother has never processed his grief at losing your mom.\n\n\n Or he's just a shallow teen who doesn't want to be \"different\" from his friends by not having a mom alive.", "NTA.  He is clearly hung up on her as well if you mentioning her at all riles him into a tirade", "NTA \n\nI feel like he is though for disrespecting the fact that you choose to keep her memory alive and grieve how you see fit for yourself", "NTA\n\nHis friends came to you, his friends asked. You did not bring these things up. It is not your fault that your brother has not told his friends. You should not be expected to lie for him.", "NTA. You didn't insult your brother for grieving differently, he insulated you. You responded after he insulated you for being \"hung up\" on the person who gave you life. I wouldn't apologize, but I would tell your brother to keep his friends and himself out of your room.", "NTA. Your bro needs therapy because suppressing grief that deeply is unhealthy. Meanwhile, don't attack him but you can't pretend your mom didn't exist because he isn't ok with it.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.  You were in your room.  I lost a parent when I was 3 and I grieved him when I was a teenager and looked at pictures all the time too. Everyone does grieve differently.  Your brother took the exact opposite root than you. But that doesn't give him a right to yell at you for mentioning her or looking at pictures.  Obviously, he's never told his friends your stepmom is his 2nd mother.  And he got embarrassed. But again not an excuse to take it out on you.  You did not go after him. He went after you.", "I\u2019m gonna go NAH, because it\u2019s true. Everyone grieves differently. \n\nYou both lost your mom at a young age. Ryan started burying his feelings and not talking about your mom. Probably because it\u2019s painful. The more he does this, the deeper down the grief gets and the more painful it becomes when bubbling to the surface. \n\nAfter the incident with Ryan and his friends he left and got high with them as was probably the plan in the first place, but by (and you were not wrong for this!!) mentioning your mom you probably brought up his feelings about her in front of his friends AND revealed to his friends that his real mom died.\n\nThis is likely not something he shared with them. He treats his step mom like an actual mom, and guys don\u2019t talk about that stuff. But they did after they found out probably. Making Ryan super uncomfortable. \n\nMen can have friends for YEARS and not know how many siblings they have if it\u2019s not relevant. \n\nSo after this incident, Ryan left, got high with his friends, and then (because weed makes you feel your feelings HARD sometimes, especially if you\u2019re alone) he came back emotional, took it out on you, and you had a fight. \n\nNo one is completely right or wrong here. I think you both could benefit from therapy. \n\nApologize to your brother, and maybe if you\u2019re up for it talk to each other about her sometime. He hasn\u2019t forgotten her. He\u2019s burying her in his mind to cope. \n\nNAH. Good luck! I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I'm a lot older than Ryan. And I still miss my dad who passed some years back. I don't talk about that a lot because the hurt sometimes can still take my breath away. Ryan had no right to lose his snit on you like that. But, don't convince yourself this means he did not love your mother. \n\nGrief is no contest. And his feelings may not even be something he can talk about. Accusing him of pretending someone else is his mother is just you being mean. You can't know what he feels truly. You only know what you feel.\n\nYou all act right and play nice with each other. Wouldn't that be honoring your mom's memory and celebrating the life she gave you?\n\nYou are neither of you ass holes - just really immature it seems to me?", "ESH.

Him not talking about her isn't disrespecting her.  You're a woman, he's a young man.  In my experience, girls have stronger relationships with their mothers.  It's just how the world is.  Not saying he never needed her, but it's probably a deeper wound to you than him, he was also a year younger than you at the time.  It's pretty telling he's using drugs.  I've been numbing my own pain with the loss of my fiancee with copious amounts of alcohol and weed.  It's possible he does indeed miss her, but it's hard to talk about.  As men, we are told to stfu and keep our feelings inside.  He may have cried in front of his friends when they brought up your mother and he felt embarrassed by it so he lashed out at you. You BOTH need therapy.", "NTA.  As a fellow woman, I, too, would not want to be replaced and forgotten if I died.

Maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re different now. Therapy isn\u2019t like a one size fits all type of thing right. Maybe he needed something else? Or maybe he just never cared idk.
