It was one of those days.\n\nBut one of his friends knocked on my door, then another appeared, then another and then eventually my brother. They were all joking around and I was laughing along because why not. Anyways, the boys came into my room and one of them noticed the pictures I had out of my mom and jokingly asked if Ryan had another sister.

I didn\u2019t really care about his yelling but the fact that he called our mother \u201cher\u201d and was yelling at me for literally nothing pissed me off.\n\nI told him that he could pretend all he wants but \u201cher\u201d is still our mom and while he\u2019s okay with pretending she never existed and treating her like dirt, I\u2019m not.

I'm sorry you are going through this.", "NTA\n\nYou're not the one disrespecting someone else's grief here, your brother is. You have every right to talk about your mom, and he has absolutely zero right to try to pretend that you don't have the right to speak honestly to another human being, just because he happens to be friends with them.\n\nHonestly it sounds like your brother may need some therapy around this issue. As that reaction is extremely disproportionate for the circumstances. \n\nAs for your step mom, and dad, I can't say I'm impressed with their stance. Your brother was being belligerent, controlling, and abusive, while also disrespecting your grief, and their response is to tell you that you're the problem? That is just straight up gaslighting, and it's abusive.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your father, and step mom are just enabling his unhealthy behaviour, because it's easier for them than addressing the uncomfortable reality that you are allowed to still see your mother, as your mother. \n\nY'all need some serious family therapy, because their responses are incredibly toxic.", "NTA, but this is probably beyond Reddit.

It could be that your brother has never processed his grief at losing your mom.\n\n\n Or he's just a shallow teen who doesn't want to be \"different\" from his friends by not having a mom alive.", "NTA.

I wouldn't apologize, but I would tell your brother to keep his friends and himself out of your room.", "NTA. Your bro needs therapy because suppressing grief that deeply is unhealthy. Meanwhile, don't attack him but you can't pretend your mom didn't exist because he isn't ok with it.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.  You were in your room.  I lost a parent when I was 3 and I grieved him when I was a teenager and looked at pictures all the time too. Everyone does grieve differently.  Your brother took the exact opposite root than you. But that doesn't give him a right to yell at you for mentioning her or looking at pictures.  Obviously, he's never told his friends your stepmom is his 2nd mother.  And he got embarrassed. But again not an excuse to take it out on you.  You did not go after him. He went after you.", "I\u2019m gonna go NAH, because it\u2019s true. Everyone grieves differently. \n\nYou both lost your mom at a young age. Ryan started burying his feelings and not talking about your mom. Probably because it\u2019s painful. The more he does this, the deeper down the grief gets and the more painful it becomes when bubbling to the surface. \n\nAfter the incident with Ryan and his friends he left and got high with them as was probably the plan in the first place, but by (and you were not wrong for this!!) mentioning your mom you probably brought up his feelings about her in front of his friends AND revealed to his friends that his real mom died.\n\nThis is likely not something he shared with them. He treats his step mom like an actual mom, and guys don\u2019t talk about that stuff. But they did after they found out probably. Making Ryan super uncomfortable. \n\nMen can have friends for YEARS and not know how many siblings they have if it\u2019s not relevant. \n\nSo after this incident, Ryan left, got high with his friends, and then (because weed makes you feel your feelings HARD sometimes, especially if you\u2019re alone) he came back emotional, took it out on you, and you had a fight. \n\nNo one is completely right or wrong here. I think you both could benefit from therapy. \n\nApologize to your brother, and maybe if you\u2019re up for it talk to each other about her sometime. He hasn\u2019t forgotten her. He\u2019s burying her in his mind to cope. \n\nNAH. Good luck! I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I'm a lot older than Ryan. And I still miss my dad who passed some years back. I don't talk about that a lot because the hurt sometimes can still take my breath away. Ryan had no right to lose his snit on you like that. But, don't convince yourself this means he did not love your mother. \n\nGrief is no contest. And his feelings may not even be something he can talk about. Accusing him of pretending someone else is his mother is just you being mean. You can't know what he feels truly. You only know what you feel.\n\nYou all act right and play nice with each other. Wouldn't that be honoring your mom's memory and celebrating the life she gave you?\n\nYou are neither of you ass holes - just really immature it seems to me?", "ESH.

Not saying he never needed her, but it's probably a deeper wound to you than him, he was also a year younger than you at the time.  It's pretty telling he's using drugs.  I've been numbing my own pain with the loss of my fiancee with copious amounts of alcohol and weed.  It's possible he does indeed miss her, but it's hard to talk about.

Op is clearly still held up on her mother. And so is Ryan. They clearly both have some stuff to work through. Like to reiterate OP is not the asshole. Neither is her brother though. Yeah he was acting like a jerk. But, he is clearly working through his issues about his mother as well.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your brother might not be grieving at all, but rather trying to ignore the significance of your loss so he doesn't have to feel it. Naturally, he would get irritable and short tempered when confronted with the memory of your mom because it would well up feelings and thoughts that's he's probably learnt to lock away. And anger is one of our go-to responses when our mind perceives that something isn't sitting well with us. Rationality comes after.\n\nI've experienced loss and didn't deal with it properly. It got to the point where my mind couldn't spend too long thinking about a memory from before the loss. My brain kept building walls, my mind would jump to morbid memories, and I'd just hit the mental eject button. I built a wall around the problem instead of addressing it. If the pile under the rug gets too big, you'll keep tripping over it until you do something about it.\n\nTry take your brothers reaction with a pinch of salt. It may take a while for him to reflect, but I think that was more of an emotionally charged response than anything deliberate. He possibly feels that he now has to talk about an uncomfortable topic with his friends and more people will find out, he'll have to explain why he hid that from them, and so on and so on until he perhaps realizes that this did indeed impact him and he could benefit from offloading his thoughts onto a therapist and getting help with sorting out the clutter.\n\nSorry for your loss as well. Time passes so quickly, mine was also over a decade ago. Dad and sister.", "Yep this. When my friend passed away suddenly (she had a terminal illness but was doing well), I didn\u2019t handle it well. I cried for a little bit with my friends and then push the pain down and went back to work (BTW, being told you friend died at work sucks). I continued to push it down, had a beer that night since I was so pissed off and continued to push it down. It\u2019ll came back to bite me at her wake and I had to leave and go hangout with my coworker and her two year old son. That year fucking suck, my friends brain tumor had decided to reappear after 30 plus years and then she dies.", "Reach out to them.", "NTA. \n\nBut your brother thinks that if he can convince himself that your stepmom is his actual mom, he can convince himself he doesn\u2019t feel that pain anymore. He\u2019s trying to bury that shit as deep as he can, plant showers on top and pretend there isn\u2019t trauma underneath. He\u2019s trying to protect himself by pretending it never happened, that mom never existed. Does that hurt you? Yes. But it hurts him more. I promise you it\u2019s clawing at his throat. It\u2019s deteriorating him, based on how harshly he reacted when mom was pointed out to his friends. And he\u2019s mad at *you* because you\u2019re not playing along with his plan to hide his pain. If you unravel it, how is he meant to continue to survive? \u201cIf sister pulls on this thread, I drown.\u201d None of this is your issue to deal with, it\u2019s your dads.
