First, contact your second job manager and let them know that girl and her daughter will no longer be allowed, and it was the first and last time you let her come. As for your mutual job, omg this girl is a nightmare Co worker and mom. Right disrespectful. My kid was always always great at restaurants and I can't imagine letting my kids do any of that. I also wouldn't bring her to an adult dinner. I'm not even sure on this one .. it can go either way with talking to her. Maybe avoid her for a while and just not include her in your plans ever again. I wouldn't get her in trouble, however, if she EVER talks violently about your refugee Co worker, that needs to be addressed. That's crazy", "YWBTA if you DON'T confront her. Someone needs to!

It sounds like her and her kid ruined everyone's night, and you might get in trouble because your description sounds like no one actually stopped the minor from having alcohol and playing with knives. Your kid or not, whether you work there or not, her parent wasn't stopping her so you or any adult at the table has the responsibility to step in and act like an adult and TAKE the knife from the child, and definitely not to leave your cups where she can reach.
