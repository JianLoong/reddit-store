Just because you tell the cop that you want to drop the charges doesn't mean the cop has to listen to you the state can pick up charges whether you say anything or not. That was a horrible thing to do to your aunt.

That makes you an asshole too.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him to stop lending your car. He did it anyway. Your car was taken without your permission which means it was stolen.

It wasn\u2019t like you haven\u2019t been patient. Your dad was trying to parent you by telling you that you didn\u2019t need the car that you bought and are paying for with your very own money. That car was not his to lend out and the key was not his to copy. Your aunt should\u2019ve been smarter than to assume otherwise, but it seems as though neither of them have any respect for you, your property, or your feelings. To this, I simply say the tired and overused phrase \u201csorry not sorry.\u201d Since dad doesn\u2019t have a job, why isn\u2019t he chauffeuring his sister around instead of \u201clending\u201d her something that\u2019s not his?

HELLO? You're putting your dad up and taking care of his affairs! He meant *\"OP, I get to decide what you do with your possessions, even when you tell me No\".*\n\nYour father said he was sorry and \"wouldn't do it again\". You set up a (very simple) boundary.

You've already played it his way (wait until the car is returned, then listen to him say he won't do it again, but then he does it again, rinse and repeat).\n\nFrankly, I think you did the right thing. **Your aunt is no innocent** **here** \\- you told her NOT TO USE YOUR CAR!! Why can't SHE Uber to her appointments - her schedule is not your responsibility.\n\nNow you have your car, and your dad is moving in with her. I'd say that's win-win.

You made that explicitly clear to **her** previously, and the person who ended up \"giving\" her permission did not have the authority to do so, as you had made abundantly clear.\n\nThis absolutely was a car theft, family or no family. \n\nNTA.", "NTa, your father completely ignores your boundaries and if he\u2019s so concerned about your aunt needing transportation why doesn\u2019t he drive her in his truck, it\u2019s not like he has anything better to do.", "NTA.  Your aunt isn't innocent here either.  You told her she couldn't borrow your car, yet she still took your dad's word for it when he loaned it to her.  She should have called to check with you before she took it.\n\nDid you get the copy of the key that your dad made?", "NTA. Warnings were given.", "NTA\n\nYou communicated with BOTH of them. Your aunt needed YOUR permission to borrow YOUR car. And since you'd already told her that she wasn't welcome to borrow it any more, she knew when she took it that last time.\n\nShe's lucky you had the charges dropped.", "ESH, It's against the grain, but you acted out of anger and frustration and caused your aunt to be arrested.  You left them to suffer while you shop, knowing that your car wasn't stolen.  This is not a criminal case, or you would have pressed charges.  It was an AH move, and while you made your point, it was a petty way to do that.  Technically, you may not have been wrong as you didn't give explicit permission. You're still an AH because of how you went about it.  What if your aunt panicked and was tased or shot for running from the police?  Would you still be pleased with it?  What if the police had overreacted and injured her while arresting her?  \n\nIt was a petty, vindictive move, and for that reason, you're the AH, and so are your Father and Aunt.  But you're bigger because you knew better.", "Info: was your aunt aware that you did not want her taking your vehicle?", "YTA, but only for wasting police resources to settle a family dispute.", "Wasting the cops time? Your car was stolen, that's not wasting their time.\n\nNTA.", "Not only that but he had a key made! That is so pre-meditated of him cause he KNEW he was going to do it again. The audacity of her Dad is astonishing  \nNTA OP", ">He had had a key made. \n\nDon't forget this line.

And instead of asking OP she knowingly went behind her back. She got what she deserved", "I bet Auntie will soon be done OP's dad living in her house xD", "This. OP, you're being manipulated. You did everything and more. These people were stealing your car. They're lucky you didn't press charges. But, now, don't let them guilt trip you into letting your dad stay. Get him OUT the door and let your aunt enjoy your dad stealing from her.\n\nFrankly, they deserve each other, and you deserve space from them.", "\"Family helps family\"\n\nThe dad should have helped the aunt out himself. She's uncomfortable driving? Dad chauffeurs.", "Also\u2026 if the dad is not working and \u201cfamily helps family\u201d why can\u2019t his father drive the aunt to appointments in his truck?!", "Or she finally gets hers fixed.", "NTA\n\n> Your aunt KNOWINGLY took your car without asking your permission. \n\nIt's worse than that. He made it clear he did not want the aunt to borrow the car. So she knew the answer was no.", "They went as far as making a separate key. That's the thing that stood out to me. I feel bad for OP.", "Exactly. Why is the aunt asking the father for OP's car and not OP themselves. The aunt knew exactly what she was doing.", "All of this, I would not have dropped the charges, OP you TOLD your Aunt she is not to even ask to use your car. She KNEW and did it anyway because her and your dad think that family won't press charges, and you didn't. \n\nI'm sorry your dad is depressed but that doesn't give him the right to do this. I'm also depressed and I don't pull these kinds of stunts. Mental health issues are NOT an excuse. \n\nNTA", "Yeah I mean it was reported stolen because it was stolen. Aunt shouldnt steal cars if she doesnt want to deal with cops", "I never got any. He gave me money.", "No, I\u2019m sorry, but OP told Auntie directly that the car was not available to be borrowed. Unauthorized taking of the car took place anywhere. Auntie was not unaware.", "Auntie was told no too. Her and dad played a game of f around and find out and found out.", "I don't have keys for it and it is huge.", "She drove her car into a curb and messed up her axle. I think.", "I told him that.", "Oh please, any reasonable adult after being told not to use the car would've reached out to at least confirm it was OK. The only reason she didn't is because she knew the answer was no...", "Except for the fact the aunt took it more than just this one time after op talked to her and told her not to. They both knew what they were doing and figured that op would not stand up for herself", "> For all you know your father told your aunt that you changed your mind and said it was fine to use the car as long as she was careful with it.\n\nThat's on OP's aunt for trusting the father then. He has shown himself to be...well, not trustworthy.", "The aunt _shouldn't be communicating with the father!_  It's not his car, it's not _his_ permission she needs; it means jack shit what he tells the aunt. The aunt needed permission _from OP_ and OP alone. She went through the father _because she knew_ OP didn't want her taking the car. Both are disrespectful AHs.", "> I spoke with my aunt and told her to stop asking for my car.\n\nAunt already had the air cleared even if OP's Father was telling a different story. Any reasonable adult would have reached out and double checked it was OK to take the car. The only reason she wouldn't check is because she knows the answer would've been no.", "If aunt is getting conflicting messages, she either needs to follow whatever OP, the actual owner, is saying, or at least explicitly confirm with her.

How would I know it wasn't stolen?", ">It was a petty, vindictive move, \n\nGood. \n\nNow Op can live knowing no one in her family will steal her car again. \n\nAnything else?", "Definitely an unpopular opinion, but I think I'm with you here. What gets me is OP went shopping and shut off her phone, causing more panic and distress. She could have waited for the aunt to return, take the key, and kick the dad out in front of the aunt. I know OP told the aunt to stopping asking dad to borrow the car, but we're not sure what dad told the aunt afterwards or on this particular day. I feel like calling the cops in this particular situation was overkill.", "I put in the post that I asked her not to borrow my car.", "Both of my keys were in my possession. How would I know it wasn't stolen.", "\"Family helps family\" does not mean \"Family helps themselves to family's  belongings without asking\".\n\nYou demonstrated helping family when you let your dad move in and arranged for him to have a monthly income while he grieved. Your dad demonstrated that he is willful, childish, selfish, larcenous, and lacking in integrity.\n\nDad's not working. He could have drove his beloved sister around.\n\nYou might want to tell \"everyone\" in your \"family\" who is now sticking their nose into this that your aunt did not have your permission to use the car. You didn't waste the police officer's time. She and your father both knew he had no right to give permission and you did not give her permission. She committed felony auto theft and there is no \"but I'm a relative of the owner\" exception to theft laws. The aunt is damn lucky you, in your benevolence, dropped the charges, and if your larcenous aunt didn't want to be traumatized like the felon she is, she shouldn't have violated the law and therefore, all of these random relatives who cared not one iota about your aunt's transportation difficulties while only you were being imposed upon should be thanking you profusely for your benevolence. Feel free to add that you would love if they expressed that through some nice gift cards.\n\nNTA.", "Ding ding ding, OP!", "Yeah and Daddy has a nice new truck he could trade in for a couple of used vehicles. You know, since he's so adamant about family helping family.\n\nAnd then there's the whole thing where he doesn't have the money to live on his own but has a brand new vehicle? Time to kick pops out.", "Yeah plus OP would be liable if aunt turned out to be Darrell Brooks... I followed the lawyer commentary of the trial and they said the mom who owned the car could face consequences.\n\nI know auntie isn't Darrell Brooks it's just on my mind. If u lend out ur vehicle u are liable for it too. It's in OP's name. Dad was out of line.", "Maybe she couldn't afford one. Besides, OP car is available for her anytime through her brother and she doesn't pay anything! I'm willing to bet they never even put gas back.", "Because she didn\u2019t think she would have to, she would simply use his for free. There is a shocking number of people who would take a family members car and not buy their own in this circumstance. I always now separate anything involving money or business away from family and friends because of what ppl who are supposed to be close to me have done.", "Or married if Aunt is his dead wife's sister. He needs a woman he can control to look after him.", "Exactly.\n\n>everyone started calling me to tell the cops that my aunt has my permission to take my car. \n\nShe didn't have permission, aunt knew it, dad knew it. Car was stolen.", "No, he is paying towards utilities and food.", "Doesn\u2019t give him any rights over the ops personal property the car.", "It still doesn't excuse this bullshit behaviour, right?\n\nHe might be dismissive like this because as the father he is used to being in charge, however it doesn't excuse the DISRESPECT towards OP", "That\u2019s true\u2026 hmm so maybe she deserved a little scare", "Yea that\u2019s what someone else said\u2026 I guess I kinda assumed aunt thought it was back to being ok", "All the more reason to never let her borrow your car", "Don't feel bad about it. You are not ta despite what this other poster has said. Your aunt took your car more than this time after you told her to stop.  Neither of them had the intention to stop because they thought you would never do anything about it.  They fucked around and found out", "Don't listen to this person OP. You told your Aunt and your dad to not use YOUR car. They are both adults and understand what you said, they also knew the consequences but didn't care because they knew you wouldn't press charges. \n\nThe fact neither of them are groveling at your feet right now proved neither of them feel what they did was wrong. They think YOU are wrong for calling the cops but you weren't wrong for doing that. They STOLE your car, just because you know them doesn't mean it's not theft. \n\nStop letting family use you and disrespect you.", "Not necessarily,  many people would assume if their being told they can borrow a vehicle their doing so with the owners consent. Aunt didn't steal the car or go out of her way to take it. The dad put the obstacles in place. Why would she assume her brother is lying to her over a car", "Your assuming the aunt asked and the dad didn't offer after that. Dad was clearly manipulating the situation and it shows with him blocking the ops car in. Op has also already stated she rang the cops knowing her aunt would bear the brunt despite it being her dad she was pissed at as he is the one who instigated the whole thing", "Op, dont mind this one. Keep sticking on those boundaries", "As I said, technically, you may not have been wrong, but it was an AH move.   You're arguing semantics and if that were the case, why didn't you phone the police every other time?   The fact is that you wanted to escalate the situation to prove a point which you made.  But you made it with an AH move.  If YOU didn't think it was an AH move, what are you asking if you're the AH in the sub?", "You can't convince me that you didn't know your dad lent it to your aunt. You dad's truck was blocking where you had parked your car and your car had been parked in the garage. You also turned off your phone after reporting your call stolen so you couldn't be reached with news of the crime you reported.", "true enough", "FYI: OP said \"nice,\" not new. But you're still right.", "I mean otherwise valid points, but a new car costs a lot less than ongoing rent.", "\\*gasp!", "Let him move in with the aunt. Older folks who think alike might do better living together like that.", "Change your locks immediately. Box his things up and tell him to schedule a time to collect them.", "Mate. He literally gave away your car. He's stomping on what few boundaries you've set up- you're better than this. You don't have to put up with this.", "Change the house locks NOW.  And the car locks if it isn't too expensive.\n\nHe left willingly.   He lost the chance to try and squat in your house for the next 6 months to a year while he continues to try and ruin your life.", "- that\u2019s what he said he was doing?\n\nNope, you need to help pack his shit up and get him out.  He SAID he wasn\u2019t going to cross your boundaries and did again anyway.  This man\u2019s word means nothing!  Pack his stuff and make sure you get the extra key he had made to your car back.  Oh, and change the locks on your house.", "Tell him to stay there. Pack up his stuff, put it on the front porch. You gave ONE boundary and he repeatedly crossed it, and is now trying to punish YOU for it!!!!", "Change the locks at your home", "Either he does not view you as an adult, some parents have a hard time with this especially when they move in with their adult children or he just doesn't respect you in any way. Both scenarios lack respect for you and you really need to think about that. \n\nIf he does stay, make therapy something he must decide to do. I won't say mandatory because therapy only works if the person is open. However, he may see that he messed up so much that therapy is something he is willing to give a shot to keep your relationship from falling apart.", "CHANGE YOUR LOCKS", "It says the rent from dad's home covers the mortgage and other expenses.", "The aunt should have been asking OP all along since it is OP's car.  The dad has no right to l9an out things that his.  The aunt knew how OP felt, and still went to the dad and not OP.  The aunt went to the dad because she knew OP would say no, and the dad wouldn't.", "She __assumed__ a lot. Let's list what we know.\n\n1. She assumed being warned by op meant nothing.\n\n2. She assumed op's father is the person to ask instead of op. \n\n3. She assumed there would be no consequences when she stole the car _again_.", "I\u2019m not, no. Even if aunt didn\u2019t explicitly ask herself, from the fact that she was told not to ask for the car again she knew she wasn\u2019t intended to be using it. So if OP\u2019s dad offered the car, she should either just have declined, or checked with OP to make sure. Dad is obviously the main culprit here, but aunt is still complicit.", "You seem ready to condemn OP, But what would you solution have been?", "> If YOU didn't think it was an AH move, what are you asking if you're the AH in the sub?\n\nYou know it's possible that you're in the minority, right? Everyone else agrees that OP is not TA.", "If I had all the keys to my car in my possession and my car is missing, I would assume someone stole it and would inform the authorities. \n\nOP was nicer than me. I wouldn\u2019t have dropped the charges.", "OP told the Aunt no herself, so the Aunt knew and took the car anyways. Try again. I would have pressed charges, the Aunt is so lucky OP didn't after she STOLE the car.", "I was pretty sure.  But not 100%.", "Either way sounds like he's got the funds to get Aunt an Uber.

I can't see their dad paying a large sum to copy the key \ud83e\udd14", "Ah, okay I misread that.", "Yeah I saw that. The point is, dad himself has plenty of ways to help. The only wants to help family is if he can mooch off other family to accomplish it.", "Ah yeah, I missed that. There's a good chance that it has an immobilizer, which can still be copied, and is still gonna be expensive to reprogram, but there are still some lower end cars that don't have those, in which case, shouldn't cost much.\n\nI'm still in favor of calling the cops again.", "You can get a key cut at the hardware store for chipped keys of the most common models. Ace does it for certain, pretty sure all the other big ones support it as well now. Its way cheaper than going to the dealership for a spare.\n\nRe-keying the car though, that will still be ridiculously expensive.
