Just because you tell the cop that you want to drop the charges doesn't mean the cop has to listen to you the state can pick up charges whether you say anything or not. That was a horrible thing to do to your aunt.

That makes you an asshole too.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him to stop lending your car. He did it anyway. Your car was taken without your permission which means it was stolen.

It wasn\u2019t like you haven\u2019t been patient. Your dad was trying to parent you by telling you that you didn\u2019t need the car that you bought and are paying for with your very own money. That car was not his to lend out and the key was not his to copy. Your aunt should\u2019ve been smarter than to assume otherwise, but it seems as though neither of them have any respect for you, your property, or your feelings. To this, I simply say the tired and overused phrase \u201csorry not sorry.\u201d Since dad doesn\u2019t have a job, why isn\u2019t he chauffeuring his sister around instead of \u201clending\u201d her something that\u2019s not his?

HELLO? You're putting your dad up and taking care of his affairs! He meant *\"OP, I get to decide what you do with your possessions, even when you tell me No\".*\n\nYour father said he was sorry and \"wouldn't do it again\". You set up a (very simple) boundary.

You've already played it his way (wait until the car is returned, then listen to him say he won't do it again, but then he does it again, rinse and repeat).\n\nFrankly, I think you did the right thing. **Your aunt is no innocent** **here** \\- you told her NOT TO USE YOUR CAR!! Why can't SHE Uber to her appointments - her schedule is not your responsibility.\n\nNow you have your car, and your dad is moving in with her. I'd say that's win-win.

She could have been hurt. The police could have assumed she was a danger and hurt her. Literally over a thousand people have been killed by police in the last year.

But they way you got it done was probably not the best, although I totally sympathize with why you did it. Again, you used the police and their valuable time to settle a family issue and you probably shouldn't have.

When your own father is sabotaging you, it then manifests in trust issues not only with him but with others.   Does he not realize the situation he's causing?  One wonders how your mom coped when she was living if he felt he could stomp all over people's boundaries.    It's good that you have asked him to find another place to live.

Or why you didn't just use his own set of keys to move his truck and get your car out.\n\nRegardless, the bridge has been burned, and us deciding if you were an asshole or not won't get the rest of your family to speak to you again or agree with us.\n\nNo judgement offered.

You gave way more chances for them to shape up and act right than was deserved, and they still refused. They f'ed around and found out. They are at fault, not you. NTA", "NTA. They all FAAFO. \ud83d\ude11", "Taking something without permission is what stealing is.", "NTA, why did you drop the charges? Your aunt literally stole your car!\n\nTime to stop being a doormat kick your dad out of the house, don't give another cent and change the lock on your car and send your dad the bill.", "This is legit why when I went out of town I decided to leave my car at my house (my dad was taking me to the airport) because I knew in my gut that my sister would drive it. She lives with him and doesn\u2019t have her own car anymore and I couldn\u2019t get a solid promise on hiding my spare keys from her. NTA. I\u2019d call the cops too if my car kept getting taken when I need it.", "NTA, is you aunt on the insurance, is she putting in gas and paying for tyres ..", "NTA. Your father and aunt conspired to\u2026checks notes\u2026STEAL YOUR CAR. I\u2019m sorry your father is behaving this way, it must be very concerning.", "You are NTA and she did not have your permission. Your dad is abusive and I would either make some huge changes in the dynamic there or follow through on him needing to live out.", "NTA. You set a reasonable boundary and your father violated it. He made a promise to you and broke it. He's the AH, not you.", "Every time parents move into their kids homes they think they make the rules still, absolutely not and the way you handled this was *chefs kiss* absolutely deserved Nta", "NTA. The Aunt KNEW you didn't want her to use the car. As well as Dad. I hope they enjoy living together. I bet it won't last long.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA.  You told them both that she couldn't borrow your car anymore.  They both disrespected you.  I'm glad he's moving out.  To me, this falls under \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\".", "No!  Great job!  You handled that exactly the way you should.  You have what some people wish they had, a BACKBONE", "NTA\n\nThe moment he threatened your lively hood, where you do not have 4 walls, utilities or even food on the table, is the moment he has to go.  And then to make a spare key and lend out your car, that is theft pure and simple.\n\nYou were kind to drop the charges, and I think you need to take the car back to the dealership, talk to them and get them to change the locks, and ignition as well, where the spare keys he made no longer works.  And if it happens again OP, do not drop the charges.", "I give you permission to be mad at both. They are treating you like a child, like your belongings are less yours because you are a kid. NTA", "Nta . You said stop taking my car directly to her. You told him to stop. It\u2019s YOUR car. Not his. He probably won\u2019t let her use his. So, you did the right thing in my opinion. And you didn\u2019t waste anyone\u2019s time. I would however find a way to get your key changed. Might need a dealership or something to do it but who knows how many keys he made.\n\nEdit.. spelling.", "NTA. If your aunt was traumatized by being arrested for stealing a car, maybe she shouldn't have stolen a car.  \n\n\nGood on you for not only being clear on your boundaries but backing them up. Dad needs to stop helping himself to your belongings. Also, if you haven't, change your locks.", "NTA. And don\u2019t feel bad that your aunt bore the brunt. She was not innocent.\nYou told her to stop asking to use it. She didn\u2019t listen.", "I wouldn\u2019t have dropped the charges personally, she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to be using your car but she did anyway and your father knew you didn\u2019t want him pending out your car. They played stupid games and won stupid prizes. NTA", "Nta", "Nta, she did not have your permission therefore she stole it. She knew you didn't want her to take it and she still did. Maybe your dad should live with her", "Totally NTA. Your aunt was just as responsible as your dad. Let them be mad. They weren\u2019t mad when that duo was taking advantage of you.", "Nta you already told aunt she can't have the car you told dad more than once stop messing with your care. They had their chance now they have to pay.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nThe AUDACITY of both your aunt and your father is astonishing. They\u2019re both terrible people.", "You told your aunt to stop taking your car. Every time your father gave her the after that she was actively stealing it. NTA", "NTA\u2026sounds like the situation is now resolved. Lesson here for him is don\u2019t treat other peoples property like it\u2019s yours\u2026", "You gave your Dad a final chance with clearly spelled out consequences. He made his choice. You also told your Aunt to stop borrowing your car and she continued to do so. This is theft, even if you didn\u2019t press charges.\n\nNTA", "In America we call this, \"Fuck around, and find out.\"", "NTA. Petty and abusive family with no boundaries.", "NTA. Your aunt knew that she needed to ask you if she wanted to borrow the car. Your dad knew that you didn't want him lending your car without your permission. They pushed it and learned a lesson!", "And car isn't fully paid off, so what if something happened while ain't had it? She's probably not on the insurance, so OP would be screwed there as well. \n\nNTA", "Stealing is a crime. They got the discount of not having charges pressed. Honestly not sure there is much conflict here. It\u2019s all already happened. You weren\u2019t in the wrong. NTA", "Not only press charges against the aunt, but also the father. He provided the key, one he made in advance. Aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit felony theft.", "Best comment I\u2019ve read all day!", "The money from the rental of my father's house is paying HIS mortgage.", "Yes. You should be just as mad at your aunt. Why did she never ask you to borrow the car? She knew if she asked you, you'd say no. Getting a key from someone else and driving a car you know the owner doesn't want you to have is theft.", "Because think of how much money Aunt saves. No car payment, gas, insurance or maintenance.  She just uses it when she needs it, so why would she contribute to it?", "Well not me personally. Just my car.", "I'd do with no remorse. Steal my stuff after I've repeatedly asked you not to, get arrested and banged up. I'd have pressed charges against them both, no question.", "Dang tell your dad to get her a bus pass. Hide your keys and get the copy your dad has back!!", "If I were OP, I'd damn sure get that spare key back, and make sure the garage is kept locked to prevent this from happening again. \n\nAlso, on the chance it did happen again, I sure as hell would NOT drop the charges. Let dad and family deal with auntie having a felony arrest record. Yes, harsh I know, but sometimes life lessons ARE hard.", "Car keys aren't cheap these days! Ask me how I know.", "OP doesn't just have to change their house locks. Now OP had to get the car locks changed too.", "She should make sure to get the copy of key back because even though he has moved out I bet they will still come and take her car.", "Well said!", "They will be quite upset if it's not done through the dealership. There's nothing against having a replacement key made, but you have to show a good bit of paperwork to get it done if you can't prove you are the individual on the lease.", "Love this", "This! Exactly what I was thinking, how OP would be liable if Aunt had gotten into an accident. My son in law is still paying off a lawsuit from over a decade ago when he let his previous girlfriend use his car and she had gotten into an accident and he was sued.", "Ohhh okay! I was like holy f*ck! Still bad that he kept your car hostage like that. How was he able to do that?", "OP should make sure family is made aware of this. I'm guessing they were lied to by Aunt and Dad about whether she had permission from OP.", "Yep. You are right. Old school key, chip key, doesn't matter wherever you can go to get them copied, no ID or proof of ownership is required.", "He also said he wasn't going to lend out your car. Color me skeptical.", "I did.  I feel a lot better.", "And my in-laws wonder why I was livid when my BiL borrowed our truck without my permission and refused to accept no as an answer from my partner. I told my partner after it happened the first time that he should shift the question to me. I can say no all damned day. Why did I blow the family up over this? The truck is in my name, the insurance is in my name, and my partner is only listed as a driver. My BiL had **totalled** four trucks in the five years previous to this event. All listed as his fault.", "He parked his truck in front of the garage.", "Make sure to be ready to call the cops to evict because I don't think he will get out until he doesn't get a choice and make sure to change the locks after he leaves.", "You\u2019re a better person than I am. I would have sent him to your aunts right then.", "It wouldn't fit.  It is about 4\" too tall to get into my garage."]}
