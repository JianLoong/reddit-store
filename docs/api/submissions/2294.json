You told your dad not to lend out your car.  You told your aunt to stop asking for it. They both decided to FAFO.\n\nAnd your dad moved out! win/win", "NTA. He is living under your house, being taken care of and the only thing you asked is that he respected your property, and he failed to do it.

And the aunt is at fault too, because you also talked to her and she still took the car.\n\nHe planned this, they made their beds and now can lay in it. What about YOUR trauma of having your stuff stollen from your own home?", "YTA. Holy balls. For all you know your father told your aunt that you changed your mind and said it was fine to use the car as long as she was careful with it. The only person you should have been taking that out on was your dad and not your aunt. You could have gotten her charge for the felony and put in prison. Just because you tell the cop that you want to drop the charges doesn't mean the cop has to listen to you the state can pick up charges whether you say anything or not. That was a horrible thing to do to your aunt. I understand you told her not to ask to use the vehicle anymore but like I said for all you know your dad could have said hey I talked to my daughter and it's okay for you to use the car now we got everything worked out she would have no reason not to believe your father.", "You didn't waste the cops time, your car was literally stolen. Just because it was stolen from someone you know doesn't mean it wasn't stolen. You specifically told them both to stop taking the car. \n\nI wouldn't have dropped the charges, and I would have evicted father, but I've got no problem getting toxic people out of my life. \n\nSit them both down and tell them that if they ever do this again, you won't drop the charges and you will evict him. \n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nYou were totally justified in kicking your dad out. Involving the cops was a waste of cop resources and unnecessarily terrifying for your aunt. Not to mention cops have been known to shoot people with little provocation? \n\nYou were too much of a coward to kick your dad out, so you used the cops to do it for you, knowing he'd want to leave after you did this. That makes you an asshole too.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him to stop lending your car. He did it anyway. Your car was taken without your permission which means it was stolen. Yes you had a good idea as to who stole it but it was still stolen. They then wanted you to LIE to the police about her having permission to use it.", "Your Aunt was not blameless in this situation. She should have been contacting you directly regarding any requests to borrow the car \u2014especially since the last time you addressed the situation, you told her borrowing the car was off the table. It doesn\u2019t matter what your dad told her. Only talking to your dad about the car is not normal and is honestly very disrespectful. Your property. Your decision. \n\nAlso\u2026 what about insurance? As you stated, you need the car to be available for your work appointments \u2014but what if your Aunt took the car and got into an accident? I don\u2019t let anyone drive my car if they are not on my insurance policy.\n\nNTA.", "Your family is a bunch of boundary-stomping thieves. \n\nKick dad out, cut him and aunt off (as well as their flying monkeys), and do not feel any guilt because *you've done nothing wrong*. \n\nNTA", "NTA - your dad went against your wishes, repeatedly. \nI think you did the right thing. You asked him not to and he continued to do it. \nI hope you and your dad can work through this, grief changes people. You are right to set boundaries because you don\u2019t deserve to be disrespected by anyone.", "There should be proportionality between action and reaction. Action: your dad lend your car to your aunt even though you forbade and he said he won't. Reaction: you caused your aunt is arrested. Result: your father lives with your aunt now. Anyone can have his/her opinion whether OP's reaction is justified or not but I don't think it is proportional. He can have the same result (his father moving to the aunt) could be obtained without traumatizing aunt. So, YTA.", "NTA.  She knew you didn't want your car being lent to her and she still borrowed it.  I won't say what I think about your father other than that he's incredibly ungrateful and entitled.", "Totally NTA. It wasn\u2019t like you haven\u2019t been patient. Your dad was trying to parent you by telling you that you didn\u2019t need the car that you bought and are paying for with your very own money. That car was not his to lend out and the key was not his to copy. Your aunt should\u2019ve been smarter than to assume otherwise, but it seems as though neither of them have any respect for you, your property, or your feelings. To this, I simply say the tired and overused phrase \u201csorry not sorry.\u201d Since dad doesn\u2019t have a job, why isn\u2019t he chauffeuring his sister around instead of \u201clending\u201d her something that\u2019s not his? SO totally NTA and if your family thinks you are, then maybe they should imagine how they\u2019d feel if dear ol\u2019 dad had been doing this to them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You made it abundantly clear that you needed the car. It wasn't his to loan. You sat you ignored calls to confirm your aunt had your permission to borrow the car but that's not true. She didn't!", "What sticks out to me is you did ask your aunt to quit borrowing the car. She was not innocent in this. \n\nI hope she and your dad finally learn to respect you and your right to control your own property. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour aunt KNOWINGLY took your car without asking your permission. that is YOUR car, not your father's.\n\nI had to LOL at \"family helps family\". HELLO? You're putting your dad up and taking care of his affairs! He meant *\"OP, I get to decide what you do with your possessions, even when you tell me No\".*\n\nYour father said he was sorry and \"wouldn't do it again\". You set up a (very simple) boundary. He broke it (again). So, what else were you supposed to think when your car has vanished? You've already played it his way (wait until the car is returned, then listen to him say he won't do it again, but then he does it again, rinse and repeat).\n\nFrankly, I think you did the right thing. **Your aunt is no innocent** **here** \\- you told her NOT TO USE YOUR CAR!! Why can't SHE Uber to her appointments - her schedule is not your responsibility.\n\nNow you have your car, and your dad is moving in with her. I'd say that's win-win. You've done way more than your share.\n\n**ETA: INFO:** do you think aunt will now somehow find it within herself to drive your dad's truck, and not feel \"uncomfortable\" (now that it's her only option)?", "NTA \n\nI love that you called the cops on them. You tried to help your dad and you gave him plenty of chances, he blew it over and over again. Also your aunt knew what she was doing.\n\nAwesome that they are living together now. Something tells me that they will be getting on each other's nerves constantly.", "The biggest thing to me is that you also took the approach of speaking to your aunt. She's not an innocent bystander here-- she was aware you didn't want her borrowing your car. Even if your dad is struggling with mental illness-- which is not an excuse for bad behavior in most cases-- she is aware and should have done better. NTA, she didn't suffer the consequences of your father's actions, she was complicit in them.", "NTA you told both of them your car was not available to borrow. They did steal it.  You had every right and could have your aunt in jail.  They didn\u2019t care and f*** around.", "NTA. You asked, you demanded, you pleaded. You also spoke to your aunt, so she should not have kept taking the car in any case.  It is just as much her fault as your Fathers. Let your dad move in with her and over step majorly there instead of with you. It had to come to a head and it did. They got what they deserved and learned a mighty lesson.", "Definitely NTA. You did the right thing, if someone takes your stuff without your permission it's stealing. I can't believe how disrespectful your father and aunt are, especially your father. You gave him a place to live and multiple chances to change his behavior and he still choose to be complete AH.", "Aunt was specifically told NOT to take the car again. She did. OP did nothing wrong.", "however, OP did tell his aunt to stop asking for his car. She was not completely clueless and innocent here", "Aunt was told to stop asking to borrow the car, she's not blame free", "Except that it's *not the father's fucking car*. \n\nAunt is a fool for not checking with the actual owner of the vehicle.", "She directly told the aunt no so she should be talking with her not her father. Yeah he could have told her she changed her mind but that\u2019s obviously onus on her as well to check that as he has obviously lied about this many times before. The aunt just decided to conveniently not question it because it benefitted her. She knew lending this car was not ok with the owner and kept doing it over and over.", "I know. I feel terrible about it. Thanks for your honest judgement without being rude. I was scared I was going to be attacked.", "The aunt could have and should have asked OP.  She didn't because she knew OP would say no.  The aunt is just as much to blame as the dad is.  They both knew what they were doing.  They both tried to take advantage of OP and stomp all over their boundaries.   If the aunt got charged it would be her and the dad's fault.", "Don't agree. Aunt should have checked with OP since OP was the one who told her it was not available.", "They didn't listen, she did what she had to do. The dad was warned and yet still did it."]}
