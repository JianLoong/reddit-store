Just because you tell the cop that you want to drop the charges doesn't mean the cop has to listen to you the state can pick up charges whether you say anything or not. That was a horrible thing to do to your aunt.

That makes you an asshole too.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him to stop lending your car. He did it anyway. Your car was taken without your permission which means it was stolen.

It wasn\u2019t like you haven\u2019t been patient. Your dad was trying to parent you by telling you that you didn\u2019t need the car that you bought and are paying for with your very own money. That car was not his to lend out and the key was not his to copy. Your aunt should\u2019ve been smarter than to assume otherwise, but it seems as though neither of them have any respect for you, your property, or your feelings. To this, I simply say the tired and overused phrase \u201csorry not sorry.\u201d Since dad doesn\u2019t have a job, why isn\u2019t he chauffeuring his sister around instead of \u201clending\u201d her something that\u2019s not his?

HELLO? You're putting your dad up and taking care of his affairs!

You've already played it his way (wait until the car is returned, then listen to him say he won't do it again, but then he does it again, rinse and repeat).\n\nFrankly, I think you did the right thing. **Your aunt is no innocent** **here** \\- you told her NOT TO USE YOUR CAR!! Why can't SHE Uber to her appointments - her schedule is not your responsibility.\n\nNow you have your car, and your dad is moving in with her. I'd say that's win-win.

Neither of them listened to you with regards to your own property & neither of them intended to stop taking your car whenever aunt wanted it nor felt any remorse for the inconvenience they were causing you. Personally I'd have reported it stolen after the blocking you in incident & I can't believe the sheer audacity of making a copy of your car key without your permission. \n\nTell family giving you grief you told them both repeatedly aunt could not take your car because you need it for work & they had already put your job in jeopardy by blocking you in & then taking the car. Dad made a copy of your key without your knowledge so they could take it whenever they liked so what were you meant to think when your car was missing but you still had your keys? No you didn't take it to far & if either of them had any respect for you at all you wouldn't have been in that position in the first place.  \n\nI know you think your dad is more to blame but your aunt is just as complicit here if not more so because you specifically told her she wasn't allowed to borrow your car because you need it available for work but she kept asking your dad for it & kept taking it without your permission.

Your dad really AHed himself out of your life, didn't he? You gave him a sweetheart living arrangement and he messed that up completely. Your car WAS stolen and you reported it.

They\u2019ve been swiping the use of you car and taking advantage,", "OP I am infuriated for you. Why is your family acting as if you only exist in the abstract? Like you're an object to be used.
