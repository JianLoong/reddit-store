You're not rejecting him as an employee because of the ink, you're rejecting him because he shows a lack of maturity.", "NTA. While you may be very judgemental towards your nephew you are also trying to run a business. If your clients are more old-school they won't want to work with someone with facial ink. \n\nMy tattoo artist friends call non cultural facial tattoos \"unemployment stamps.\" \n\nBody modification acceptance is coming along but face ink and extreme mods are not helpful in customer facing roles.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA because it seems like the tattoo on his FACE and his previous behavior is the reason you\u2019re not wanting to hire him. Not just because he\u2019s got tattoos. You also don\u2019t want to give him the same position his sister has already put in the work for, it\u2019s basic business. She\u2019ll be pissed if he\u2019s paid the same and hasn\u2019t put in any work. He should accept the custodial role and you guys can talk about his role in the company going forward when he proves he wants to be there for real", "Actions have consequences. One of the consequences of tatoos is that it will make some employers uninterested in hiring you. The reality is, the world doesn't owe you anything.  NTA as an employer, you have to look out for your business interests.", "Nta. Tattoos on the face are have a certain bad vibes to them for many people. Depending on your type of business - that might not be the look you are going for. People have the right to get tattoos - but they don't have the right to expect people to just ignore the fact they have them.", "NTA. Getting a face tattoo is a *choice*, and I definitely agree that people are likely to see your company as less legitimate if they are dealing with someone who has a face tattoo. If it was some kind of deformity or scar that he had no control over, that would make you a bit of an AH, but this is not the case. You also said you offered him a non customer-facing role, so I don't think you are being unfair here.", "Info: What exactly is your business? You say things like front facing and custodial so is this business a restaurant or retail establishment?", "NTA. Choices have consequences. You will not be the only potential employer who passes on an applicant with a jobstopper. You at least were honest with him about it and offered him a position he could work up from.", "NTA\n\ntbh he sounds like the kind of person you should never employ, just not worth the drama", "NTA. And I say this as someone with many tattoos. Tattoos may be becoming more popular/ commonplace, but a face tattoo is always a stupid idea that is going to hurt your chances for employment except in a few niche markets. Very few businesses want to put a face tattoo in a customer facing position because it looks unprofessional. Behold the consequences of his shitty decisions.", "NTA for me. Face tattoos do still have stigma, so business wise, it could be a bad decision to place him in a customer facing role. Putting aside the tattoos, he just hasn't put in the work to deserve to be in a similar role to his sister. I think you've gone the right way with things by still offering him a role where he can prove he has a work ethic before any chance of moving up.", "NTA that\u2019s a legitimate standard. His loss stand your ground a face tattoo is very different than any other tattoo", "Nta.   You were giving him a job.   It's just not exactly what he wanted, so he went crazy.  That shows that he has a really shit personality.  And I would not trust him at all as a face role.", "NTA. First of all, its plain stupidity if you recruit family into your business, especially stupid family members who become a liability to everyone around them. If there is any fallout you end up with double the damage.\n\nSecond, you are a businessman in your business, you don't look out for family, you look for efficiency and profits. By not recruiting your cousin you are NOT discriminating between him and rest of your employees.\n\nLastly, being a mentor doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your future to recruit mentee. Also you have already recruited his sister, so that means \"YOU HAVE helped family already\".\n\nHis reactions show he is going to still fool around and drive you to unnecessary stress and failures both in business and family relationships. Best ask yourself if you actually need it. Him having ink is secondary, that is just your personal opinion.", "NTA - if that is your standard, then you are treating him the same as everyone else.", "It depends on the culture and if the tattoo is significant culturally. If it's just a random tattoo on someone's face, even tattoo artists call them jobstoppers.", "NTA, having someone with a face tattoo in a customer facing position is pretty embarrassing. I wouldn't do it either.", "NTA - This is your business to do as you wish. Why would you be the asshole? He sounds entitled. \n\nYou built something lucrative and his choices are a barrier to work at your company. This is a shared view across many industries. Best to him as he finds his niche and thrives.", "NTA. It sounds like you're not hiring him because of his work ethic and criminal background, not because of his tattoos. However, it does sound like you are being prejudical about tattoos.Tattoos are much more socially acceptable than they used to be. I work at a law firm and my boss has sleeves - it's never been an issue and they can be covered if a conservative client is in the office. Unless they're offensive, imo, tattoos are usually not a reason to disqualify someone from a job. That being said, hand and face tattoos are a deal breaker in a lot of industries because they cannot be covered up easily (ex: I've never seen a lawyer with hand/face tattoos). They're called \"job stoppers\" for a reason.", "nta. you're the employer, you get to set the requirements/standards, as long as it's not illegal discrimination. After his storming off, I wouldn't hire him even if he came back and agreed. He needs to learn that he has act like an adult. Imagine him doing that to any other employer...", "My nanny had tattoos all over her arms and hands. Most of them can be covered and none of them are weird. On the face would have been a deal breaker for hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve even had conversations about how some people don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s a line of professionalism that if you cross with tattoos or piercings you\u2019re going to severely limit yourself. \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nIt's not rocket science, tattoos make you unemployable in a whole lot of jobs that deal directly with customers. \n\nYou aren't required to give him a job, and you were exceptionally kind in offering him a position", "NTA", "INFO: Are we talking about gang tattoos? Vulgar tattoos? Otherwise inappropriate tattoos? Or are you just opposed to any tattoos?\n\nAlso, you say you\u2019re five years older than they are, but how old are you and they?", "There's a lot to unpack here.\n\n*He got loud with me... and it\u2019s not fair cause we are family.*\n\nHe needs to get something straight: **you don't owe him a job just because he is family.** You don't owe his sister a job either.\n\nHis sister has demonstrated she is worthy of the job because of her natural aptitude and/or attitude towards the job. He has not.\n\nAll you owe your nephew is to treat him exactly the same as anyone else who applies for a job with you.\n\nI presume that anyone else, not related to you, who showed up looking for a job while sporting a face tattoo would not be hired.\n\nWhile tattoos on the arms, legs, and torso are much more acceptable generally than they used to be (with some exceptions, such as Japan), it is a fact that in many industries, in many countries, tattoos on the face, neck, or hands carry a stigma, and people who have them tend not to be employed in customer-facing roles. Same with excessive facial piercings.\n\nI am giving you the benefit of the doubt, and assuming that your line of work is one of those. As long as this type of discrimination is legal and commonplace where you live, and that you have a reasonable belief that you would lose business if you hired him for a customer-facing role, then you can legitimately refuse him a job.\n\nSo, for that, you are NTA.\n\nHowever, I'm sensing a rather controlling vibe in your post:\n\n*All these things I advised him not to do... the one thing I told him not to do above all is mark his body...*\n\nHis **body**?\n\nYou don't like tattoos, I get that. I don't like them either. But I don't dictate to other people what they can do with their own bodies. As long as the tattoo can be easily covered in situations where it would be socially or professionally unacceptable to show it, then hey, go for it. It's your body, do what you like.\n\nYou could have reasonably said to him \"If you get a tattoo on your face, neck, or hands, your employment prospects will plummet. I urge you not to do that, to keep your options as open as possible.\"\n\nBut you seem to have told him not to get a tattoo **at all, anywhere.** You don't actually have a say in that, and it's not at all surprising, given his rebellious nature, that he pushed back against you.\n\n*even after he told me he wouldn't get anymore... I can't trust him.*\n\nThat was not a promise you had any right to expect from him. I am unsure whether \"*I can't trust him*\" is related to his tattoos specifically or some other situation where he demonstrated his untrustworthiness, such as stealing from you or lying to you. But if it's only the tattoos, then \"*I can't trust him*\" is quite a leap.\n\nYou also seem oddly fixated on his tattoos to the exclusion of all else. At the start of your post, you listed a bunch of reasons why he's not a good fit for your business. He has been in trouble with the law. He has hung around with gangs. He apparently has no skills to offer you or any interest in acquiring some. He has never shown the slightest interest in working for you, until he realized there was money to be made. He sounds uninterested in your line of work, except for what he can get out of it for himself.\n\nAll of those are valid reasons to refuse him a job, without ever even mentioning the tattoos.\n\nI urge you to take a step back, stop trying to be a mentor to him, and stop offering him advice, unless he comes to you, says he wants to change, and sincerely asks for your advice. No matter how well-intentioned you might be, you're coming across as very controlling.", "You listed many valid reasons- the tattoo being the least of them. You don\u2019t owe him an excuse, but if you are going to give one, the tattoo is the most ignorant one you can give.", "I have tattoos, but I put mine where they can't be seen, for precisely this reason. And a lot of people are creeped out by face & neck ink.", "Half YTA half NTA\n\nYTA for making it about his tattoos when there are better reasons to not hire him. \n\nNTA for not hiring him in general.", "NTA  He spent years going against your advice and making his own choices now he has to live with those choices. He should realize the odds are very low that he will ever get a job that deals directly with customers with a face tattoo of a religious symbol.", "Nah NTA here", "YTA. I just hate people who judge people with tattoos, it makes you an asshole!", "Depends on the business and how covered is his face", "ESH. It's not about the tattoos. It would be YTA if it were just his skin. Not horrible, but an asshole because you are judging all tattooed people. Look around, it's very common, even visible ones. I work in a more conservative field and it's been blown wide openn by some pretty gifted people that are very tattooed. One of the most sought after experts I work with is covered from hands to chest. Get over that because most people have.\n\nThat said, he's being an entitled jerk. His behavior is enough for me not to hire him even if he wore 3 piece suits.\n\nNot trusting him because he didn't follow your antiquated advice on his body is ridiculous, but not trusting him because he has demonstrated criminal and behavioral issues... yes.\n\nEdit: for years I put off my dream tattoos because I was worried about what people thought. It was beyond stupid. I'm very good at what I do and no one cared.", "NTA\n\ntattoos, even on face, are really no big deal anymore \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to hire him to work with clients with his history of bad decisions and poor judgment \n\ngiving him a chance to prove himself in a custodial role is something he should jump at\n\ntoo bad he stormed off", "YTA. You're being judgmental by saying that tattoos \"send the wrong message\". I have many and I teach at university. Welcome to 2023.", "Is your business truly going to be affected by tattoos? I know doctors with full sleeves of tattoos. It wouldn\u2019t stop me from getting surgery by them. So does he have truly offensive tattoos? \n\nYou have every right to make him prove himself. But blaming the tattoos? Come on. That sounds like a BS excuse. If he proves himself, will you let him be front facing? If so, the tattoos are actually irrelevant and you need to remove them from your reasoning.", "YTA for focusing on the tattoo yeah. This isn't the 80s pops. Tattoos aren't taboo. I wouldn't hire him either for the other reasons but tats got nothing to do with it.", "Your attitude is insufferable.", "NTA but you also sound like a really mean person and like you just don\u2019t like this kid. So like you\u2019re an A but not The A", "Some of the nicest people I know have tattoos and usually they don't reflect the real personality of the person who has them.  But society still has a pre-existing notion of what people with tattoos are like, for right or wrong.  Heck the hospital I worked at still doesn't allow anyone with tattoos on their head, neck or hands to hold any positions in patient care.  Of course it has nothing to do with whether or not they have the skills necessary, but again, perception.  It is YOUR business, you have to do whatever it takes to make it successful.  If his tats would cost you anything at all, you can't have him in any direct customer interactions.  You don't say what your business is which COULD make a difference, but you need to make the best decisions for your business that you can.  He made the decisions to get the tats and has to live with it.  NTAH.", "NTA but I would have focused on all the other details you provided rather than just the face tattoo (honestly it sounds like hiring the nephew would be extremely risky regardless of the face tattoo). By focusing on that you\u2019ve given him something to blame you for now, as depending where you live it could be considered discrimination especially if you said specifically that was the reason.", "Yeah kinda are... it's a tattoo.. sounds like the other reasons should be talked about more instead of some ink.", "INFO\n\n>  Visible tattoos send the wrong message\n\nAnd what message is that, exactly?", "YTA for punishing your nephew for making life choices you don\u2019t agree with and behaving like you\u2019re the parent. You\u2019re not. A decent role model and mentor would understand we aren\u2019t all our past and we can make choices to better ourselves. You see him making that choice and assume he just wants in for money. Well, maybe a good job with family is what he needs to get on track. How\u2019s the guy get a chance to get up when you keep reminding him he\u2019s down?", "INFO:  Does the country you are working in have a cultural stigma against tattoos?  The US used to but that has mostly gone by the wayside.", "Tattoos are legal and cause no harm to anybody, so yes I think you\u2019ve been unfair here", "[deleted]", "YTA - tattoos are expressions.  I don\u2019t judge people by the way they look. It\u2019s by the way they do their job.", "Going against the grain here, yes, YTA. If it was genuinely just because of the tattoo at least. People keep mentioning face tattoos are likely to make you unemployable, but you have full choice in this matter. You\u2019re terribly judgemental and you\u2019re hiding it behind it being a business decision when it\u2019s so obviously an ego thing. Your nephew didn\u2019t listen, so you\u2019re punishing him, everything else is just fluff. Do you actually think you\u2019ll lose clients because of a little cross? \n\nAlso, if it is what it sounds like, the face tattoo could be covered with a little bit of makeup if it really mattered. In general it seems like him having tattoos in general is a problem for you which is ridiculous, I work in a business, in office and everyone has tattoos. Might just be a cultural thing in that Americans are typically uptight and people have actually grown up everywhere else. If you\u2019re not American than I genuinely don\u2019t know, can\u2019t even assume it\u2019s cultural at that point", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While some tattoos have become more acceptable in recent years...facial tattoos are too closely associated with gang behavior.", "If he was judging his nephew as a family member in a family setting in their personal time I would agree with you. But this is business not personal. Whether it\u2019s fair or not is a matter of opinion but the reality is face tattoos send a wrong message in business.

It depends on the business and the clientele. I work in a field where a lot of people are still holding onto the traditional ideas of what looks and doesn't look professional.

I know I\u2019m projecting because I see my older sisters in his behaviour, and how they treat one of my nieces for making choices they wouldn\u2019t make.

New recruits can be turned away for tats on face, neck and hands; branch depending.", "[deleted]", "I do agree w/ that, which is why I reiterated if it is genuinely just because of the face tattoo.\n\nTo me at least I was having a hard time figuring out if it\u2019s the face tattoo and all the other problems are just backup that he ultimately wouldn\u2019t have cared about if not for the tattoo, which if that\u2019s the case does just come off as punishing him for making decisions he doesn\u2019t agree with, as opposed to having legitimate qualms that would make him not want to take his nephew on. \n\nBut if all the other issues are the primary problem and the tattoos are the \u201cfinal straw\u201d so to speak then that makes more sense, but it seems to me that the other issues aren\u2019t as big a deal as the tattoos, coupled with the way OP talks about his nephew in general. I\u2019m open to the idea I\u2019m wrong though, either I am and OP can largely ignore me amongst a million NTAs judging people for the act of getting ink on their skin in a place that they think of unprofessional, or I\u2019m right and maybe he takes my comment into consideration. Either way I do hope the best for him and his nephew, and that maybe OP could calm the judgement on people who don\u2019t do things the way he does by like, 30% for the sake of being a better person because in general the way he talks comes off as incredibly rude and egotistical", "And he is successful, and gets to make those determinations, which is how the world works.", "Absolutely they can.", "Right?

Successful people are fucking around living life for the lols, dude. You're kind of making OP's point for him.", "OP isn't judging in general tattoos. OP never said she/he personally hated tattoos. Op just warned nephew not to get any tattoos that are visible, like on the hands, arms, neck and face. Then afterwards, nephew did exactly that, and has lost the chance given to him. He was even offered a job regardless and he got upset for the mistakes and choices he's made.  All in all, it sounds like it's not about the tattoos, but how the nephew lives and makes poor choices no matter how many times OP tried to help.", "If you think the corporate world gives a fuck about you or really anyone else for that matter?
