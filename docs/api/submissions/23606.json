He doesn\u2019t have a record thank goodness but the one thing I told him not to do above all is mark his body. So what does he do? Inks up his arms, hands, and most recently his face with a \u201clittle\u201d cross even after he told me he wouldn\u2019t get anymore.\n\nI can\u2019t trust him.

He got loud with me and said I was discriminating against him and it\u2019s not fair cause we are family.\n\nI just said everyone who works with me I treat as an extension of myself so they represent me.

You're not rejecting him as an employee because of the ink, you're rejecting him because he shows a lack of maturity.", "NTA. While you may be very judgemental towards your nephew you are also trying to run a business. If your clients are more old-school they won't want to work with someone with facial ink. \n\nMy tattoo artist friends call non cultural facial tattoos \"unemployment stamps.\" \n\nBody modification acceptance is coming along but face ink and extreme mods are not helpful in customer facing roles.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA because it seems like the tattoo on his FACE and his previous behavior is the reason you\u2019re not wanting to hire him. Not just because he\u2019s got tattoos. You also don\u2019t want to give him the same position his sister has already put in the work for, it\u2019s basic business. She\u2019ll be pissed if he\u2019s paid the same and hasn\u2019t put in any work. He should accept the custodial role and you guys can talk about his role in the company going forward when he proves he wants to be there for real", "Actions have consequences. One of the consequences of tatoos is that it will make some employers uninterested in hiring you. The reality is, the world doesn't owe you anything.  NTA as an employer, you have to look out for your business interests.", "Nta. Tattoos on the face are have a certain bad vibes to them for many people. Depending on your type of business - that might not be the look you are going for. People have the right to get tattoos - but they don't have the right to expect people to just ignore the fact they have them.", "NTA. Getting a face tattoo is a *choice*, and I definitely agree that people are likely to see your company as less legitimate if they are dealing with someone who has a face tattoo. If it was some kind of deformity or scar that he had no control over, that would make you a bit of an AH, but this is not the case. You also said you offered him a non customer-facing role, so I don't think you are being unfair here.", "Info: What exactly is your business? You say things like front facing and custodial so is this business a restaurant or retail establishment?", "NTA. Choices have consequences. You will not be the only potential employer who passes on an applicant with a jobstopper. You at least were honest with him about it and offered him a position he could work up from.", "NTA\n\ntbh he sounds like the kind of person you should never employ, just not worth the drama", "NTA. And I say this as someone with many tattoos. Tattoos may be becoming more popular/ commonplace, but a face tattoo is always a stupid idea that is going to hurt your chances for employment except in a few niche markets. Very few businesses want to put a face tattoo in a customer facing position because it looks unprofessional. Behold the consequences of his shitty decisions.", "NTA for me. Face tattoos do still have stigma, so business wise, it could be a bad decision to place him in a customer facing role. Putting aside the tattoos, he just hasn't put in the work to deserve to be in a similar role to his sister. I think you've gone the right way with things by still offering him a role where he can prove he has a work ethic before any chance of moving up.", "NTA that\u2019s a legitimate standard. His loss stand your ground a face tattoo is very different than any other tattoo", "Nta.   You were giving him a job.   It's just not exactly what he wanted, so he went crazy.  That shows that he has a really shit personality.  And I would not trust him at all as a face role.", "NTA. First of all, its plain stupidity if you recruit family into your business, especially stupid family members who become a liability to everyone around them. If there is any fallout you end up with double the damage.\n\nSecond, you are a businessman in your business, you don't look out for family, you look for efficiency and profits. By not recruiting your cousin you are NOT discriminating between him and rest of your employees.\n\nLastly, being a mentor doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your future to recruit mentee. Also you have already recruited his sister, so that means \"YOU HAVE helped family already\".\n\nHis reactions show he is going to still fool around and drive you to unnecessary stress and failures both in business and family relationships. Best ask yourself if you actually need it. Him having ink is secondary, that is just your personal opinion.", "NTA - if that is your standard, then you are treating him the same as everyone else.", "It depends on the culture and if the tattoo is significant culturally. If it's just a random tattoo on someone's face, even tattoo artists call them jobstoppers.", "NTA, having someone with a face tattoo in a customer facing position is pretty embarrassing. I wouldn't do it either.", "NTA - This is your business to do as you wish. Why would you be the asshole? He sounds entitled. \n\nYou built something lucrative and his choices are a barrier to work at your company. This is a shared view across many industries. Best to him as he finds his niche and thrives.", "NTA. It sounds like you're not hiring him because of his work ethic and criminal background, not because of his tattoos. However, it does sound like you are being prejudical about tattoos.Tattoos are much more socially acceptable than they used to be. I work at a law firm and my boss has sleeves - it's never been an issue and they can be covered if a conservative client is in the office. Unless they're offensive, imo, tattoos are usually not a reason to disqualify someone from a job. That being said, hand and face tattoos are a deal breaker in a lot of industries because they cannot be covered up easily (ex: I've never seen a lawyer with hand/face tattoos). They're called \"job stoppers\" for a reason.", "nta. you're the employer, you get to set the requirements/standards, as long as it's not illegal discrimination. After his storming off, I wouldn't hire him even if he came back and agreed. He needs to learn that he has act like an adult. Imagine him doing that to any other employer...", "My nanny had tattoos all over her arms and hands. Most of them can be covered and none of them are weird. On the face would have been a deal breaker for hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve even had conversations about how some people don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s a line of professionalism that if you cross with tattoos or piercings you\u2019re going to severely limit yourself. \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nIt's not rocket science, tattoos make you unemployable in a whole lot of jobs that deal directly with customers. \n\nYou aren't required to give him a job, and you were exceptionally kind in offering him a position", "NTA", "INFO: Are we talking about gang tattoos? Vulgar tattoos? Otherwise inappropriate tattoos? Or are you just opposed to any tattoos?\n\nAlso, you say you\u2019re five years older than they are, but how old are you and they?", "There's a lot to unpack here.\n\n*He got loud with me... and it\u2019s not fair cause we are family.*\n\nHe needs to get something straight: **you don't owe him a job just because he is family.** You don't owe his sister a job either.\n\nHis sister has demonstrated she is worthy of the job because of her natural aptitude and/or attitude towards the job. He has not.\n\nAll you owe your nephew is to treat him exactly the same as anyone else who applies for a job with you.\n\nI presume that anyone else, not related to you, who showed up looking for a job while sporting a face tattoo would not be hired.\n\nWhile tattoos on the arms, legs, and torso are much more acceptable generally than they used to be (with some exceptions, such as Japan), it is a fact that in many industries, in many countries, tattoos on the face, neck, or hands carry a stigma, and people who have them tend not to be employed in customer-facing roles. Same with excessive facial piercings.\n\nI am giving you the benefit of the doubt, and assuming that your line of work is one of those. As long as this type of discrimination is legal and commonplace where you live, and that you have a reasonable belief that you would lose business if you hired him for a customer-facing role, then you can legitimately refuse him a job.\n\nSo, for that, you are NTA.\n\nHowever, I'm sensing a rather controlling vibe in your post:\n\n*All these things I advised him not to do... the one thing I told him not to do above all is mark his body...*\n\nHis **body**?\n\nYou don't like tattoos, I get that. I don't like them either. But I don't dictate to other people what they can do with their own bodies. As long as the tattoo can be easily covered in situations where it would be socially or professionally unacceptable to show it, then hey, go for it. It's your body, do what you like.\n\nYou could have reasonably said to him \"If you get a tattoo on your face, neck, or hands, your employment prospects will plummet. I urge you not to do that, to keep your options as open as possible.\"\n\nBut you seem to have told him not to get a tattoo **at all, anywhere.** You don't actually have a say in that, and it's not at all surprising, given his rebellious nature, that he pushed back against you.\n\n*even after he told me he wouldn't get anymore... I can't trust him.*\n\nThat was not a promise you had any right to expect from him. I am unsure whether \"*I can't trust him*\" is related to his tattoos specifically or some other situation where he demonstrated his untrustworthiness, such as stealing from you or lying to you. But if it's only the tattoos, then \"*I can't trust him*\" is quite a leap.\n\nYou also seem oddly fixated on his tattoos to the exclusion of all else. At the start of your post, you listed a bunch of reasons why he's not a good fit for your business. He has been in trouble with the law. He has hung around with gangs. He apparently has no skills to offer you or any interest in acquiring some. He has never shown the slightest interest in working for you, until he realized there was money to be made. He sounds uninterested in your line of work, except for what he can get out of it for himself.\n\nAll of those are valid reasons to refuse him a job, without ever even mentioning the tattoos.\n\nI urge you to take a step back, stop trying to be a mentor to him, and stop offering him advice, unless he comes to you, says he wants to change, and sincerely asks for your advice. No matter how well-intentioned you might be, you're coming across as very controlling.", "You listed many valid reasons- the tattoo being the least of them. You don\u2019t owe him an excuse, but if you are going to give one, the tattoo is the most ignorant one you can give.", "I have tattoos, but I put mine where they can't be seen, for precisely this reason. And a lot of people are creeped out by face & neck ink.", "Half YTA half NTA\n\nYTA for making it about his tattoos when there are better reasons to not hire him. \n\nNTA for not hiring him in general.", "NTA  He spent years going against your advice and making his own choices now he has to live with those choices. He should realize the odds are very low that he will ever get a job that deals directly with customers with a face tattoo of a religious symbol.", "Nah NTA here", "YTA. I just hate people who judge people with tattoos, it makes you an asshole!", "Depends on the business and how covered is his face", "ESH. It's not about the tattoos. It would be YTA if it were just his skin. Not horrible, but an asshole because you are judging all tattooed people. Look around, it's very common, even visible ones. I work in a more conservative field and it's been blown wide openn by some pretty gifted people that are very tattooed. One of the most sought after experts I work with is covered from hands to chest. Get over that because most people have.\n\nThat said, he's being an entitled jerk. His behavior is enough for me not to hire him even if he wore 3 piece suits.\n\nNot trusting him because he didn't follow your antiquated advice on his body is ridiculous, but not trusting him because he has demonstrated criminal and behavioral issues... yes.\n\nEdit: for years I put off my dream tattoos because I was worried about what people thought. It was beyond stupid. I'm very good at what I do and no one cared.", "NTA\n\ntattoos, even on face, are really no big deal anymore \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to hire him to work with clients with his history of bad decisions and poor judgment \n\ngiving him a chance to prove himself in a custodial role is something he should jump at\n\ntoo bad he stormed off", "YTA. You're being judgmental by saying that tattoos \"send the wrong message\". I have many and I teach at university. Welcome to 2023.", "Is your business truly going to be affected by tattoos? I know doctors with full sleeves of tattoos. It wouldn\u2019t stop me from getting surgery by them. So does he have truly offensive tattoos? \n\nYou have every right to make him prove himself. But blaming the tattoos? Come on. That sounds like a BS excuse. If he proves himself, will you let him be front facing? If so, the tattoos are actually irrelevant and you need to remove them from your reasoning.", "YTA for focusing on the tattoo yeah. This isn't the 80s pops. Tattoos aren't taboo. I wouldn't hire him either for the other reasons but tats got nothing to do with it.", "Your attitude is insufferable.", "NTA but you also sound like a really mean person and like you just don\u2019t like this kid. So like you\u2019re an A but not The A", "Some of the nicest people I know have tattoos and usually they don't reflect the real personality of the person who has them.  But society still has a pre-existing notion of what people with tattoos are like, for right or wrong.  Heck the hospital I worked at still doesn't allow anyone with tattoos on their head, neck or hands to hold any positions in patient care.  Of course it has nothing to do with whether or not they have the skills necessary, but again, perception.  It is YOUR business, you have to do whatever it takes to make it successful.  If his tats would cost you anything at all, you can't have him in any direct customer interactions.  You don't say what your business is which COULD make a difference, but you need to make the best decisions for your business that you can.  He made the decisions to get the tats and has to live with it.  NTAH.", "NTA but I would have focused on all the other details you provided rather than just the face tattoo (honestly it sounds like hiring the nephew would be extremely risky regardless of the face tattoo). By focusing on that you\u2019ve given him something to blame you for now, as depending where you live it could be considered discrimination especially if you said specifically that was the reason.", "Yeah kinda are... it's a tattoo.. sounds like the other reasons should be talked about more instead of some ink.", "INFO\n\n>  Visible tattoos send the wrong message\n\nAnd what message is that, exactly?", "YTA for punishing your nephew for making life choices you don\u2019t agree with and behaving like you\u2019re the parent. You\u2019re not. A decent role model and mentor would understand we aren\u2019t all our past and we can make choices to better ourselves. You see him making that choice and assume he just wants in for money. Well, maybe a good job with family is what he needs to get on track. How\u2019s the guy get a chance to get up when you keep reminding him he\u2019s down?", "INFO:  Does the country you are working in have a cultural stigma against tattoos?  The US used to but that has mostly gone by the wayside.", "Tattoos are legal and cause no harm to anybody, so yes I think you\u2019ve been unfair here", "[deleted]", "YTA - tattoos are expressions.  I don\u2019t judge people by the way they look. It\u2019s by the way they do their job.", "Going against the grain here, yes, YTA. If it was genuinely just because of the tattoo at least. People keep mentioning face tattoos are likely to make you unemployable, but you have full choice in this matter. You\u2019re terribly judgemental and you\u2019re hiding it behind it being a business decision when it\u2019s so obviously an ego thing. Your nephew didn\u2019t listen, so you\u2019re punishing him, everything else is just fluff. Do you actually think you\u2019ll lose clients because of a little cross? \n\nAlso, if it is what it sounds like, the face tattoo could be covered with a little bit of makeup if it really mattered. In general it seems like him having tattoos in general is a problem for you which is ridiculous, I work in a business, in office and everyone has tattoos. Might just be a cultural thing in that Americans are typically uptight and people have actually grown up everywhere else. If you\u2019re not American than I genuinely don\u2019t know, can\u2019t even assume it\u2019s cultural at that point", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You owe no one a job, not people with tattoos, not family, no one. They have no case. Nta.

And who is getting divorced?", "He could get tattoo covering make up I don\u2019t see how tattoos are supposed to prevent you from customer facing rolls I\u2019ve worked with doctors and nurses who had visible tattoos it didn\u2019t stop them from doing their job.

You have no right to police other people's bodies. There is a significant difference between advising somebody not to get face tattoos due to employment issues and being annoyed that they get any tattoos at all. You may have had some valid reasons for not hiring your nephew, however your general attitude towards him makes it clear that you would never have considered hiring him unless you could look down on him while doing so. Nothing wrong with custodial work, but the way you talk about your nephew, sounds like you'd delight in it.\n\nYTA\n\nAnd you seem to have a habit of giving your opinion where it's not wanted. You've been going into Islamic subReddits and pushing them to join Christianity, or straight up arguing with people on there. Why am I not surprised at your tattoo stance now?", "YTA\n\nIf it were his past, and the way he messed up in his past, then you would be fine. But you're literally discriminating because of tattoos. That's gross. YTA", ">Not horrible, but an asshole because you are judging all tattooed people.\n\nWrong. This affects his business. You're just in your feelings over your own personal situation.\n\n> Not trusting him because he didn't follow your antiquated advice on his body is ridiculous\n\nIt's not antiquated advice in the least bit.

The OP wasn't fully clear if they were gang tattoos but a lot of gangs are into facial tattoos, and apparently the kid was in a gang, so I wouldn't be surprised.", "No, but if I did that shouldn\u2019t be a problem because it\u2019s not about how I look.", "If I knew this about your business I would not use it. To me it says you are pedantic and unable to focus on the important issues in favor of securing control.\n\nAgain this might be a cultural difference so things could be different where you are.

The biggest one is on my leg; it sparse from the bottom edge of my bikini line to halfway down my calf. All my tattoos are easily covered (with the exception of the small one on my wrist).

It is known.", "Me too! I saw the first tattooed police officer in Vancouver almost ten years ago. Suuuper friendly (well, he was Canadian) and helpful.

However, the motive could be a dealbreaker.", "A lot of departments still don\u2019t allow it or require cover ups. Most of the ones that allow it now are doing out of necessity because of difficulty recruiting.", "Yeah I was hesitant to vote NTA for this reason. OP is RIGHT in this case, but the way they go about it isn\u2019t cool. There\u2019s a very controlling vibe to their language in general, almost as if they\u2019re pissed they have no influence on the nephew and take that personally. It does conflate the issue.", "Your comments show otherwise.

I will say that it sounds like your nephew has made some mistakes and is trying to recover, but your \"opportunity \" feels insulting. \"He can clean up my trash and earn his way if he so chooses\".\n\nYou told your nephew that you're not putting him in a better position because of his tattoos, but if I were your nephew, I wouldn't believe it for a moment. From what I'm reading, were I your nephew, I would believe you're punishing me because I didn't obey your \"advice\" like a good little drone.\n\nYTA for how you treat your family.

I\u2019m saying, \u201cwas the skill set she brought to the company her looks?\u201d If it\u2019s no, then be careful, because you unintentionally absolutely implied it.", "1. I mean all the things that are in OP's post and that point to narcissism.\n2. YOU used the word first in this thread. So what the fuck ?? If you recognized narcissism in OP, and narcissism in the comments, why do you defend that OP isn't a narc ? You're acting erratically.\n3. Narcissim is a personality style, not a diagnosis. What this means, is there is no need for a diagnosis, when only a diagnosis stands between the personality disorder and its recognition. When people like Dr Ramani say it's not a diagnosis, what they mean is that they don't need to diagnose it for it to be a thing, and it's not a sickness according to the DSM-5, it's a personality style. This doesn't mean that narcissists aren't dysfunctional, broken, perverted, mean, assholes, entitled, cruel, oblivious to their own flaws and unforgiving of other's shortcomings. In other words, although I know the good Dr Ramani wouldn't get behing that, Narcissism is very much a mental illness, only you're not allowed to say it. You are illustrating this bullshit taboo. The same Dr Ramani made an hour-long video explaining that as long as you describe the degeneracy without saying \"narcissist\", then people won't object to discussing problematic behaviour, but as soon as the cat is out of the bag, you get lambasted and gaslighted and enablers do their thing. This isn't normal. OP is narcissistic, and there's plenty evidence to show it in his speech and the way he talks about himself and others, which have no bearing on the situation he's describing. It's never about interpersonal conflict, it's about what people speak like how they react emotionally, it's about personality, not the nature of conflict. Conflict might indicate a difficult personality, however.\n4. It's very much still used in psychiatry, the notion that it wouldn't be is ludicrous.\n5. Just because you show narc traits, doesn't mean you are a narc. **But just because you're not diagnosed, doesn't mean you're not one. In fact if it squawks like a duck, swims like a duck, and takes a shit on people's good reputation and their life, it's probably a narc.**\n\nAnd just because your narcissism doesn't warrant a diagnosis of NPD doesn't mean you aren't a narcissist by the DSM-5 standard either. Personality styles can be identified based of objective clinical aspects. And the only difference between a narc who's diagnosed with NPD and a narc who's not diagnosed, is if the narc suffers from being an asshole. **Employers and people who enjoy wealth and control aren't in that category, but they are very much sick, still**. A narc who doesn't suffer form his condition isn't sick according to psychiatry and psychology. That's bullshit, by the way.\n\n**The only difference between a narc and an NPD sicko, is the diagnosis. Please keep that in mind when trying to come up with fake distinctions between a colloquial narcissist and a real one, because there is not such difference. Either one is a narcissist, or one isn't.**\n\nOP seems to be a narcissist for all the reasons many people who are not blind or oblivious to that personality style have pointed out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is nothing more blatant than an entrepreneur with a self-made story who derives his sense of identity and pride from just being the boss. OP expresses fantasies of control, and rivalry with nephews only 5 years younger than him which are undissociable from his sense of achievement as an entrepreneur.\n\nOP never states what the job offer to his nephew was, and seems to offer a job but not give it. He's toying with his object. OP treats people like extensions of himself. That's narcissism.\n\nTo him, image is more important than money, but only when it benefits him. When it comes to being exploitative, then his values are reversed : **He's heavily implying that he's willing to pay his nephew not in money, but in experience**. An abusive behaviour that he doesn't out and admit to flatly, but that discerning redditors also spotted.\n\nWhat we truth tellers see, other people may not. Hypotheses : \n\n* \\- OP promised a job, then retracted his offer when the nephew needed it (perverse toying).\n* \\- OP offered a job, but it must have been a janitorial position or something extremely low paying and low grade (humiliation).\n* \\- OP offered a job, but didn't offer pay (exploitation).\n\nWe don't know the whole story.", "I don\u2019t see how those things I listed make me toxic. Seems like a universal standard.", "Looks are not a skillset.", "Your post and your comments have shown that you have a mindset of \"I'm right, anyone that doesn't listen to me is wrong. I'm a winner, listen to me or be a loser.\" You've shown this by essentially telling your nephew he's only useful as a janitor when it appears that he has the same amount of skills as his sister, and that you're punishing him because he didn't follow you like an obedient drone.\n\nIf you had actually read the comment you replied to, you would've read this already.", "Something about your language is off. Answer yes or no: did your nieces appearance play a role in your hiring her?\n\nYou sounds like your choosing your words to avoid directly answering, so just say yes or no if her appearance was at all, in any way, a factor in your decision to hire her?", "He doesn\u2019t have the same skills as his sister not even close. He\u2019s essentially incompetent and not a good fit for the role he wants so I offered something he could start off with and work his way up from should he meet my conditions. His ego got in the way of that. His refusal to humble himself is on him, he\u2019s not special."]}
