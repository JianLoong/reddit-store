The NP (M50) had given her a breast exam (with her breast fully exposed) to further evaluate her complaint. \n\n(Not to mention, I have chaperoned several female exams and before his comments, this particular exam made me cringe). \n\nOnce the patient left the room, he made several comments to me about the largeness of her breast/implants and then said that he was \u201cjealous of the attending doing the CT scan because he got to touch and squeeze them\u201d. \n\nNot only as a woman with a larger chest, but this supposed-to-be professional healthcare worker, sexualizing a patient, did not sit well with me. I spoke with a few of my co-workers to see if I was overreacting and they all said I should file a complaint, because my thought process is, if I was that patient and being sexualized by a provider, I would want someone to speak up for me too. \n\nMight I add, I have NEVER gotten an unprofessional or creepy vibe from any one of the physicians I have worked with, but when I worked with this man, It felt like I had a wrench in my stomach, to the point of  not feeling safe going anywhere alone with him. \nAITA?

That's creepy and inappropriate.  Also an NP here and I've worked in the ER as a nurse.  I know that nurses and medical professionals tend to have dark senses or humor.  We cuss. We make inappropriate jokes. We talk about and laugh about gross things. We make bets on blood alcohol levels and how long before this patient dies and who will break the first ribs during CPR. Healthcare workers are a SALTY bunch. But his comments are WAY over the top. You should report it. At the very least...say something to the attending that was on duty.", ">\u201cjealous of the attending doing the CT scan because he got to touch and squeeze them\u201d.\n\nNTA - yes everything he said was clearly way beyond inappropriate. Reporting him is the ONLY thing to do here.", "i work in an obgyn. absolutely not appropriate behavior from his at ALL. that is disgusting and you definitely need to speak up. NTA", "NTA. If he is now comfortable talking to a female coworker about his unprofessional behavior, its gone to an extreme place and he should have been removed a long time ago. Please report him before he continues to assault women under the pretense of his position as a healer.", "NTA \n\nHe was completely inappropriate", "NTA. Reproductive healthcare is already so difficult for women without objectification by their medical profession. You\u2019re doing the right thing, and other women will be safer for it.", "Absolutely NTA. Women have the right to receive medical care without the fear of being subjected to it becoming a sexual experience. You\u2019re helping to protect that right. His behavior towards his patients and his coworkers is disgusting and needs to be addressed.", "You did good! Keep up the good work. \n\nI remember being young and my doctor making a joke when I needed to get my privets checked. I can remember it bugging me in the moment but luckily I have loving parents and a good sense of self worth even at a young age so I was able to shake it off. But I can only imagine what impact the comments would have made if it where a more insecure child. Things like this need to be addressed and can effect anyone at any age. There is already so much mistrust in our healthcare we don\u2019t need doctors getting of on a quick squeeze and feeling entitled enough to do so.", "NTA\n\nHe has overstepped, and does need to be reported.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely file a complaint, his behaviour is highly unprofesional, towards the pacient and towards you too.

Report!", "NTA. \n\nHis behaviour is unacceptable.", "What would make you think you were an asshole in this situation?  Clearly you did nothing wrong.", "NTA x100000.", "NTA.

Idk why he thought the comment was gonna fly.", "**NTA**\n\nThank you for reporting. As a healthcare professional myself it can be very uncomfortable to report a colleague but it is vital that such behaviours do not go unchallenged. Thank you for being brave, for realising your discomfort, for observing and for fulfilling the exact role of the chaperone to protect the patient and the clinician. In this case that NP is WAY out of what I would consider acceptable.", "NTA\n\nWhoa! I'm sure this goes on but WHOA! How wildly inappropriate. Women hate doing these types of exams for this exact reason. Please report him if you haven't already.", "NTA and please report him!", "NTA. \n\nFrankly, I think you would lowkey have been TA if you hadn't reported it. You did the right thing. What he said was creepy and gross and SO beyond inappropriate. Don't even worry about him losing his job because if he does? He deserves it.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t report it. I\u2019m a student nurse myself and even I know how grossly unprofessional and disgusting that comment is. This is a man that\u2019s in a position of power and trust around vulnerable people and those are his thoughts??? It\u2019s extremely concerning. This needs to be reported immediately.", "NTA. You would be TA if you didn\u2019t. As a side note, there are so many cases of health professionals performing unnecessary exams or doing them unprofessionally, on a patient\u2019s chest/groin. It is absolutely necessary to report him.", "NTA, Nta at all, you absolutely did the right thing, it makes me feel good to know that their are some medical professionals who are actually professional, and willing to do what is right in order to assure that patients aren\u2019t violated. He was creepy, perverted, and out of line.", "Nta it is your job to care for the patient.  What he has said and done is sexusl.abuse. It is you duty to report him. Who knows what he will do next if he is allowed to continue.  This gut is in the wrong profession. Protect your patients by reporting him.", "NTA. I have a large chest too and can totally see drs making comments about why it\u2019s obvious my back hurts or something like that.
