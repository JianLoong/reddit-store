Truth hurts. Don\u2019t dish out what you can\u2019t eat.", "NTA. Not only is there nothing wrong with being submissive, but couples sometimes say flirty things like that to each other even when there isn't a D/s dynamic. Your friends should never mock you, or make fun of you for who you are. (They are also probably envious of your relationship and taking it out on you.) I'd suggest making new buddies, more open-minded ones.", "NTA. Glass houses, stones, that kind of thing. You have a happy relationship; they don't. It's just stupid to tease someone about something where you're worse off.", "NTA and you weren\u2019t even being disrespected, your wife praised you.

Calling a grown man \"good boy\" can certainly be disrespectful and condescending, even in the context on praise.\n\nIt is diminishing and belittling, diminishes masculinity, maturity, and the power dynamic.\n\nImagine telling an adult employee \"good child\" for doing a task at work. Now see how the content is only marginally different.\n\nOp was also very young when he got together with his wife and probably doesn't have much experience or understanding of power dynamics in relationships other than his own.\n\nMen often get put down or told to man up, or not be \"whipped\". Sometimes it's an insult, sometimes it's friends telling you to have self-respect in the relationship....", "It\u2019s not even about \u201cdealing with a woman\u201d it\u2019s basically the friend being so adamant that a woman\u2019s place is below a man\u2019s. He got so offended that OPs wife somehow disrespected him, when clearly OP is into it. I said in another comment that his viewpoint is probably why a lot of his relationships don\u2019t work out. He might just need to find a woman who\u2019s into being dominated. Or just open his mind that certain people like certain things romantically or sexually.\n\nOr maybe the friend is secretly into being a sub as well and is just super jealous that op has a woman dominating him lol", "Ya normal friends would tease Op maybe for 5 seconds with an unoriginal \u201coh ho ho who wears the pants here\u201d and then drop it. Not tore into op and said they were embarrassing and then not letting it go for days. The friend was also the one who called op submissive, op never brought it up and tried to shut the friend down.\n\nIn a different context if a friend made fun of anything else, for example (not related to op) like acne, or his laugh, or the way they dress, and kept poking after being told to stop, then that\u2019s annoying and they deserve to get pushed back too", "You\u2019re a bland person if you\u2019ve got nothing to do but tease somebody\u2019s relationship for over a week.", "A day of jokes? Sure.\nAfter a week of the same however it's no longer a gentle joke and requires a bigger response", "But it wasn\u2019t a work relationship, it\u2019s a husband and wife relationship that op is clearly on board with. OP wasn\u2019t upset at all about what his wife said to him, even if it was said in a \u201ccondescending manner.\u201d\n\nOP didn\u2019t have beef with his wife he got annoyed that the friend kept making it an issue after op told them to stop. If the friend was truly concerned they wouldn\u2019t have kept teasing op about it and insulting him and actually voiced concern as a friend", "Um I think OP knows his wife and their relationship better than you  or his friend does", "Someone\u2019s projecting", "Ya the friend and this guy clearly have some issue against women being in charge. Maybe they should try it out sometime they might like it"]}
