Your friend would probably be mad if you told her she wasn\u2019t your type lol. Don\u2019t worry about her. If she wants to be mad, that\u2019s on her. The point is you told her on your timetable, not hers.", "NTA\n\nYour friends are acting like bigots and you deserve better. Your sexual orientation is not their business, you're allowed to have privacy, and it's pretty narcissistic of them to assume that you'd be attracted to them at all.", "NTA.  Did they tell you their sexual preference when you meet them?  So I guess now you say hello my name is Dangerousprinkles and I'm a lesbian.  Just get a name tag made.  This is too weird.  Do they think you hang out with women just to see their goodies?", "She\u2019s not entitled to know your sexuality and sh\nes wildly homophobic. Drop her NTA", "NTA. You came out and they were extremely shitty and are just plain homophobic. I'm sorry it went that way. You did absolutely nothing wrong!", "NTA make new friends, preferably non homophobic ones. And let them know that just because you're a lesbian, doesn't mean that they are your type. That's a bit conceted.", "NTA. Screw those people.", "NTA - coming out is hard and they reacted in a repulsive way. Unfortunately your \"amazing friend group\" is also highly homophobic. You deserve much better.", "In a pub once, a woman came up to me & said \u201cCan I sit next to you - I\u2019m a lesbian?\u201d. I simply asked \u201cWhy, is it contagious?\u201d. I may have been tipsy at the time, but I thought it was sad she assumed she\u2019d get a horrible reaction. NB she sat down, it\u2019s not contagious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni", "NTA - in fact, total opposite.\n\nThat is straight up homophobia right there. And frankly, people like them are the reason coming out as gay is so hard for some people. Their friends might react exactly like that.", "NTA. They're homophobes and you don't want them in your life. Simple.", "NTA \u2014 As an older lesbian who also came out my first year of university \u2014 these girls you speak of are not your friends, they are homophobes. I know it is hard to say goodbye to old friendships, but any friendship that holds judgement against you for simply being your happiest, most authentic self is NOT a friendship worth having. I, too, lost several friendships upon coming out, but I gained many more throughout university that I cherish on a much deeper level than I ever could have imagined was possible with the \u201cfriends\u201d I had before. Be true to yourself, unapologetically, and surround yourself with people who celebrate the true you. It will get easier, and you will be better for it, I promise.", "NTA but They probably already have an idea. I've had several friends or people from work cone out over the years and not one ever suprised me.", "NTA. Did they have the courtesy of telling you that they\u2019re straight?", "NTA\n\nThis is a them problem and a them hangup. I've changed in front of people who are gay before and they never made me feel uncomfortable. They never creeped on me or stared inappropriately. The fact that they assume you did so, when clearly you didn't, because if you had, they would have noticed, just because you're gay, is just so bigoted of them.", "You will find that about 80% of people who claim to be \"progressive\" or \"allies\" suddenly become insanely homophobic once it hits close to home.", "NTA - everyone has covered how your \"friends\" are the AHs, and pro-tip from a fellow lesbian who didn't/doesn't announce their sexuality upon making new acquaintances, if your university has an LGBTQIA society, join it! It isn't just one big dating club, they tend to have movie nights and bar outings and chat corners, so usually something for everyone. I was very lucky to go to a uni with one. If you do have one, go for it!", "You need new friends, I'm straight and I wouldn't have a problem getting changed in front of any lesbian friends, I don't know any straight women who would feel weird about this, those people are just ahs", "NTA. Their reaction is proof that you were right to wait and they couldn't be trusted with that info. I'm sorry you found out your friends were AHs. I hope you are able to find kinder, more empathetic people that don't make your coming out about them. Is there a LGBT group in your school?", "They would have acted homophobic the friend said that to her by saying \"if I had known at the beginning I would have acted different\". When did it become the norm to tell people when you first meet them hi I'm a lesbian or hi I'm straight. Ridiculous!", "Wow queen, you hit the nail on the head right there. She is too good looking for a lesbian not to lust after her. Such garbage people. Op, fuck these homophobes and go meet some nicer people. X", "Lesbian here, and I've been lucky enough to have friends like you!  The response of OP's 'friends' is completely odd, I've been lucky enough that no one has ever accused me of lurking on them in changing rooms and whatnot.  \n\nMy wife came out to her friend in the 90's and, sobbing, my wife says \"I'm gay, but I promise I haven't looked at you that way, just as a friend\" and her friend says \"First of all, obviously you're gay. I know.  And secondly, how dare you not be attracted to me, I'm quite good looking!\"", "I have a similar story. Lifelong friend of mine, been in all sorts of situations together, and after 20 odd years of knowing each other, he comes to the realization he is gay. He videocalls me (we live far away now unfortunately), and tells me veeeery carefully that he is feeling attracted to guys. My reaction is rather neutral, good for you, how is life otherwise? You could see it was what he expected. Big smile, gave me an update about his life. Most of his close people reacted with a similar reaction (ranging from \"good for you\" to \"it was quite clear\" (tbh, I always thought he was some sort of queer). \n\nHonestly, I never felt uncomfortable with him. I have changed in front of him, slept in the same bed, been alone... he is a great guy, I love him, that's all that matters to me. And the people that reacted weirdly... well, garbage takes itself out I guess", "Yep. This is just as bad as the men that don't like to be around gay men because \"they'll get hit on\" (and, to be fair, it's usually the men that aren't exactly the pick of the litter). \n\nDo these girls like all men they see because they're straight? No, obviously not. Works the same way for girls that are gay. They aren't attracted to every woman they see. FFS. Why is that so hard for people to comprehend?", "I\u2019m confused. What\u2019s the difference?", "That would be the homophobe's worst nightmare. How dare you being a lesbian? And even worse! How dare you not being attracted to me? I am the epitome of attractiveness!", "A preference is, there are five things I\u2019d eat on this table, but I want to eat the fourth one most of all.\n\nOrientation is, this is the table.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle nuance that honestly I wouldn\u2019t have bothered to call OP out on, but there you go.", "I was genuinely curious after your comment. Thanks for explaining. I googled it, but your explanation was better.", "I don't think it is a subtle nuance. People don't choose to be gay. They just are. It's an important consideration in the face of discrimination and oppression. The persecution of homosexuality is persecuting people for things they can't change about themselves. \n\nYou can avoid preferences. I prefer to eat roast beef but I can live on turkey. For a lot of people who see roast beef as morally wrong, why not just eat turkey? If I can ONLY live on roast beef, making roast beef illegal becomes a very different experience for me.", "I think \"trope\" would be the better word here, it is fairly common in rom coms and dramas where the male protagonist pretends to be gay to get closer to a girl he's crushing on. Then it comes out he's straight, and at first the girl thinks, how creepy, but after he explains he's just some \"poor, shy, introverted, middle class white boy\" it's actually a \"really sweet, romantic gesture\" and she realizes she's loved him all along! And then they kiss in the rain for some reason\n\nEdit: spelling mistake", "It\u2019s a subtle nuance in the context of the comment being corrected. While your points are absolutely valid for the issues overall, in this particular case the swap is irrelevant, because both your sexual preferences *and* your sexual orientation are nobody\u2019s business but your own. Picking at the word choice detracts from the positive message and serves no purpose beyond pedanticism."]}
