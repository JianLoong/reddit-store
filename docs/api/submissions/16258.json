He videocalls me (we live far away now unfortunately), and tells me veeeery carefully that he is feeling attracted to guys. My reaction is rather neutral, good for you, how is life otherwise? You could see it was what he expected. Big smile, gave me an update about his life. Most of his close people reacted with a similar reaction (ranging from \"good for you\" to \"it was quite clear\" (tbh, I always thought he was some sort of queer). \n\nHonestly, I never felt uncomfortable with him.

Thanks for explaining. I googled it, but your explanation was better.", "I don't think it is a subtle nuance. People don't choose to be gay. They just are.

The persecution of homosexuality is persecuting people for things they can't change about themselves. \n\nYou can avoid preferences. I prefer to eat roast beef but I can live on turkey. For a lot of people who see roast beef as morally wrong, why not just eat turkey? If I can ONLY live on roast beef, making roast beef illegal becomes a very different experience for me.", "I think \"trope\" would be the better word here, it is fairly common in rom coms and dramas where the male protagonist pretends to be gay to get closer to a girl he's crushing on. Then it comes out he's straight, and at first the girl thinks, how creepy, but after he explains he's just some \"poor, shy, introverted, middle class white boy\" it's actually a \"really sweet, romantic gesture\" and she realizes she's loved him all along!

The stat is only counting reported rape from one specific study (U.S. Dept. of Justice, Violence Against Women Report, 2002) that focused on women. Men don't report rape anywhere near as often as women do for a myriad of reasons, chief among them the ridicule and negative social stigma they may perceive to have to endure afterwards. Crime stats are only accurate if people are willing to report them. Just like there are men who don't report rape, there are also women who don't. These studies are great to get a feel for how pervasive a problem is, but due to how many go unreported, they aren't the slam dunk this person thinks they are.", "Yes I do, because it\u2019s one study.
