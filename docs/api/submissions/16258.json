If they think gay immediately means predator no wonder you didn't come out to them immediately, because you were fearful of *exactly* how they reacted when you told them.  Your friends need to get over their homophobia, I'm sorry you decided to come out to people you cared about and they rejected you in such a disgusting way.  Awful.  And if you *had* come out to them when you first met, would they have still been as close to you? or acted just as homophobic but more fake about it?", "NTA. Your sexual preferences are *nobody's* business but you're own. If they felt comfortable inviting you to what they consider private situations they wouldn't invite a straight guy to, that's on them.", "Nta\n\nI never felt the need to tell people I meet that I'm straight, so it's weird she makes such a big deal out of this. As if she's so irresistible that she should safeguard her virtue cuz you must be attracted to her luscious hips.", "NTA  \nNo one is entitled to know what your sexual orientation is. Coming out is a very personal journey and nobody has a say in when that happens but you.  \nThey aren't the people you want to be friends with. They are ignorant and immature.", "NTA.\n\nA lot of times friends feel honored that you would tell them at all. The problem seems to be that your friends are homophobic.", "NTA. It's shit like this that made you not share.\n\nGood luck in the future.", "NTA. Unless you told them you are \"straight\", it is an assumption they made. You are under no obligation to disclose your sexuality.", "Wowwwww. Sorry you had to find out this way that your friends are raging homophobes!

And anyone who tells you that they would not have changed clothes in front of you presumes you to be a sexual predator. These are **NOT** friends. \n\nI basically outed myself to my mother and therefore the rest of the immediate family at twenty.

It\u2019s as if they think you will get aroused seeing them pee or change clothes.

You aren't obligated to tell someone you're a lesbian any more than you would be obligated to tell someone you're straight if that were the case. I would probably have excused myself from being around people changing just out of courtesy but I think I would do that regardless of my sexual orientation. And sexual orientation most definitely shouldn't impact going to the bathroom, as if being a lesbian means you'd get some sort of sexual kick out of seeing a girl pee in a club bathroom, wtf. If a guy asked me to accompany him to the bathroom at a club (and it was clear they just wanted to use the bathroom), sex would be the last thing on my mind. Don't worry, you didn't deceive your friends because they aren't real friends. I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope you find some better people!!", "emphatically NTA   \n\n\nfellow lesbian here. this is just blatant homophobia and it's time for new friends. i'm so sorry you're going through this, i know how badly it hurts when a friend assumes you're some sort of predator just because you like women.   \n\n\nluckily, i can also tell you there's a lot of really caring and understanding friends you can and will make out there who won't make these gross sweeping generalizations and you'll be better off for it.", "NTA, it's none of their business", "NTA.

I know it's easy to say move on and make new friends, and that the reality of that is harder, but they're not nice people.

They can be very superficial and over time you weed out the fake ones.  I always told my lesbian friends (I had 3 in my sorority), as long as you don\u2019t hurt anyone, you do you love!", "NTA and fuck that person honestly. \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, nobody is entitled to that information, and there's nothing wrong with changing in front of someone no matter what sexuality. \n\nYou absolutely do not have to disclose your sexuality just to be okay going into a changing room where there's other people. It has zero to do with sexuality and everything with basic human decency and respect. \n\nYour friend is just homophobic. You really didn't do anything wrong. \n\nIf someone ogles other people in changing rooms that isn't because of their sexuality, it's because they're creeps. You're not a creep. You do not have to out yourself to anyone and you absolutely can change together with other people or go to the club bathroom or whatever else you want without outing yourself first. \n\nI'm so sorry you had to experience this when trusting someone enough to tell them this, but this is 100% your friend being an asshole and you being NTA", "When my friend came out to me i was supportive, told them I was happy and proud they came out to me and that it must have been hard keeping it a secret or not having someone to talk to.

You need better friends, ones that aren\u2019t homophobic.", "NTA I don't understand this \"I'd act differently if I knew you were gay\" just because someone is attracted to the gender you are doesn't automatically mean they are attracted to you like not all straight people are attracted to everyone who is the opposite sex? It's weird Ur friends seem secretly homophobic", "Ugh, you are definitely NTA. These aren\u2019t safe people and I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this.", "NTA, the fact that people react like them is why we stay closeted in the first place", "They wouldn't have become friends in the first place if she'd come out then", "Was it Michael Stipe that said, \u201cunless you are naked sitting in my lap you don\u2019t need to know my sexual preferences\u201d \nOr something like that.

And surely you'd say a man doing this is doing something wrong: lying and manipulating women to get some sexual thrill. This is what OP's friends are accusing her of. \n\nHowever the crucial difference is that OP didn't lie so they could be in intimate situations with their friends, she was just afraid to come out because she actually is gay.", "\u201cMeme\u201d being the operative word though? I\u2019ve never heard a real life anecdote of this happening. I\u2019m sure it has because wild ass shit happens out there - as we regularly see on AITA - but that\u2019s not a normal assumption. I would think it\u2019s more common for a guy to think he\u2019s gay and come out and then realize there are exceptions and some girls he finds attractive and reassess himself as bi. Sexuality is messy and weird. \n\nIt\u2019s very weird for OP\u2019s friends to base their entire worldview on a super uncommon scenario.", "Yeah I totally agree, the friends are being ridiculously weird.", ">  the friends are being ridiculously weird.\n\nThe word you're looking for is *homophobic*."]}
