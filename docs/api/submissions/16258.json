If they think gay immediately means predator no wonder you didn't come out to them immediately, because you were fearful of *exactly* how they reacted when you told them.  Your friends need to get over their homophobia, I'm sorry you decided to come out to people you cared about and they rejected you in such a disgusting way.  Awful.  And if you *had* come out to them when you first met, would they have still been as close to you? or acted just as homophobic but more fake about it?", "NTA. Your sexual preferences are *nobody's* business but you're own. If they felt comfortable inviting you to what they consider private situations they wouldn't invite a straight guy to, that's on them.", "Nta\n\nI never felt the need to tell people I meet that I'm straight, so it's weird she makes such a big deal out of this. As if she's so irresistible that she should safeguard her virtue cuz you must be attracted to her luscious hips.", "NTA  \nNo one is entitled to know what your sexual orientation is. Coming out is a very personal journey and nobody has a say in when that happens but you.  \nThey aren't the people you want to be friends with. They are ignorant and immature.", "NTA.\n\nA lot of times friends feel honored that you would tell them at all. The problem seems to be that your friends are homophobic.", "NTA. It's shit like this that made you not share.\n\nGood luck in the future.", "NTA. Unless you told them you are \"straight\", it is an assumption they made. You are under no obligation to disclose your sexuality.", "Wowwwww. Sorry you had to find out this way that your friends are raging homophobes! You are NTA.", "NTA, and you need new friends.\n\nThey are not owed this information and the fact that they would\\will\\started to treat you differently because of it has a name, \"homophobia\". \n\nI mean, imagine they trying to explain that.\n\n\"are you a homophobe?\" \"no\" \"why did you block her then?\" \"because she's lesbian\"... like... what?", "NTA, not by a long shot. \n\nComing out is a personal process. And anyone who tells you that they would not have changed clothes in front of you presumes you to be a sexual predator. These are **NOT** friends. \n\nI basically outed myself to my mother and therefore the rest of the immediate family at twenty. But the rest of my extended family, friends and business associates were a gradual process over years. \n\nYou owe no one else any explanation for your personal behavior.

Your friend is one though, lose her.\n\nAlso sort out if there are any assholes in the rest of the group, and lose them too.\n\nIf it's an asshole conference, lose the group.", "NTA!   Her response was ignorant and telling.  You have the right to disclose that information as you see fit, when you see fit.", "NTA?? at the end of the day you were doing what you felt comfortable and safe doing. i like girls as well but don\u2019t view my girl friends in that way at all. like we can do the same things without me eyeing her because i\u2019m able to separate those relationships. i want to say theyre assholes bc they\u2019re not understanding and being dramatic, but i\u2019d ask to meet up for coffee or something and explain how you feel", "NTA - and actually these people might be a tad homophobic. It\u2019s as if they think you will get aroused seeing them pee or change clothes. To them I say grow up.", "NTA\n\nComing out is very complicated, and no one has the right to shame you for how long it takes you.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to tell someone you're a lesbian any more than you would be obligated to tell someone you're straight if that were the case. I would probably have excused myself from being around people changing just out of courtesy but I think I would do that regardless of my sexual orientation. And sexual orientation most definitely shouldn't impact going to the bathroom, as if being a lesbian means you'd get some sort of sexual kick out of seeing a girl pee in a club bathroom, wtf. If a guy asked me to accompany him to the bathroom at a club (and it was clear they just wanted to use the bathroom), sex would be the last thing on my mind. Don't worry, you didn't deceive your friends because they aren't real friends. I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope you find some better people!!", "emphatically NTA   \n\n\nfellow lesbian here. this is just blatant homophobia and it's time for new friends. i'm so sorry you're going through this, i know how badly it hurts when a friend assumes you're some sort of predator just because you like women.   \n\n\nluckily, i can also tell you there's a lot of really caring and understanding friends you can and will make out there who won't make these gross sweeping generalizations and you'll be better off for it.", "NTA, it's none of their business", "NTA.

I know it's easy to say move on and make new friends, and that the reality of that is harder, but they're not nice people.

It's homophobic to think that someone is entitled to knowing someone's sexuality period, especially on the basis that they assume that she's into them. It's also pretentious.
