She should have been doing this from the start, but it seems that she is too stubborn and lazy to do so.\n\nYou're also 100% right that as your brother grows, his hitting and tantrums will become increasingly dangerous to others. The fact that he hits you, your sister and your friends is abuse. Someone, maybe your father, should call Child Protective Services and report that your mother is allowing your brother to physically abuse you and your sister. \n\nBecause of your mother's neglect and enabling, your brother might need to go to a treatment facility, both to teach him skills, and to protect others from his behavior.\n\nCan you and your sister go live with your father? It would be safer for you.\n\nI hope things work out,", "NTA\nWonder, does he hit mom? How's she going to handle it when he is bigger and stronger and lashes out on her, and you have moved out. Who's she going to blame then?", "NTA shes using autisum as an excuse to not parent him and its going to get much worse.  hopefully you are saving money to move out with your sister so mommy can have her adult tantrum child all to herself.", "NTA. Had a much longer response but lost it so I\u2019ll just say I have an autistic 7yo and from personal experience, your mom can literally improve the situation by going to therapy and having him do so too. I assume she doesn\u2019t mean to do this, but she is currently setting him up for failure in the future. Good luck, and best wishes, sincerely!!", "NTA - I don't think it's fair for your mum to say it's your fault if your brother eats your pizza. However, I don't think telling your mother that your father is a better parent to your brother is a good idea- you may want to approach this part more diplomatically.", "NAH.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert on autism as a diagnoses but I have experience supporting people with autism and those with autistic traits through my job. I\u2019m saying NAH as it sounds like your mother is struggling and in relation to that, you are all struggling. I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re trying to teach her to parent, but offering different alternatives for supporting your brother through his more tough times.\n\nI\u2019d say now he is getting older, it will become more concerning for you all as he will be getting bigger and stronger. You are right in saying you cannot discipline behaviour as a lot of people with autism do not understand what they have done \u2018wrong,\u2019 but you can certainly support people through their emotions. There are communicative tools you can use to help your brother communicate his thoughts and feelings - social stories, talking mats - and I\u2019m wondering if you have access to services where you live who can help you? Social workers, charities, respites. It may help trying to communicate with him to learn his triggers, likes and dislikes, sensory issues etc. There is also medications that can be prescribed to help your brother when he is past the point of no return and needs something to help him calm down.

My father has no interest in CPS since he\u2019s kind of hiding away for child support charges and he doesn\u2019t want to cause more family issues, even though he has been financially absent he is a great father figure emotionally. \nThank you for your suggestion, I\u2019m still looking for other options to maybe help the situation", "Unfortunately I live in an area in Texas which is very far from all the cities and places with resources, whenever we did live in the city a lot of the providers would quit and claim that it was too hostile of an environment which I guess I can understand. My brother is currently on meds and we\u2019re trying it out to see how it goes, we\u2019ve had many different experiences.\nOne medication made him more aggressive and caused him to have panic attacks. Another would calm him down but it made him lose interest in everything he enjoyed doing. It also made him kind of just stare off into space, he would rarely eat, rapidly lose weight, and looked like he didn\u2019t know what was going on around him. So we stopped those meds and are still trying to see what works for him, it\u2019s a process but I\u2019ve tried to talk to my mother about the possibility that the meds just don\u2019t work for him and that we can try to adjust things here and change some things", "You and your sister are old enough to choose which parent to live with, regardless of any custody agreement. You both need to get away from your brother and mother for your own *physical safety.*  Much as I hate to say this, there is also the risk that your brother might turn to s-@-- as he gets older. \n\nCouldn't your father just let the two of you live with him *temporarily* until you finish school and can get a place of your own or go away to college?  If not, are there any relatives who might let you and your sister live with them for a year or two? Can a school counselor help you?\n\nI am seriously worried about your situation. Please look for ways to get out of there and away from your brother as soon as possible.", "This isnt just child abuse for you but child abuse towards your brother. Never getting a child with serious developmental delays due to autism counseling, school support, nursing staff due to his lack of potty training is child neglect. I worked at an autism center for some time and kids with autism can absolutely be taught. As he gets bigger the fact that he never got help will get dangerous. I've had concussions and broken ribs from kids with aggression behaviors. And those are kids that have the occasional bad sensory day, not kids that were never given the opportunities and resources they need.\n\nI would talk to your school counselor. It's possible that the school itself can intervene to get everyone the help they need.", "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. I really feel for you! \n\nAnother thing I can think of is having green, yellow and red cards? Sometimes when someone is overwhelmed with emotion they find it hard to listen to anyone, their comprehension is out the window, but a visual can help them as it\u2019s easier to understand. Pictorials in general seem to benefit those with autism. Perhaps you\u2019re already using a system like that. \n\nIn terms of medication, perhaps something like an \u2018as and when\u2019 could be beneficial, like when someone is feeling super anxious and needs an extra med to take the edge off.\n\nI hope things improve for you all soon \ud83d\udc99", "You're NTA, but there's a very good chance your mother never changes. She hadn't until now, she may never.\n\nSometimes you can be totally right but also unable to change or fix a tough situation. You may find this is one of those.\n\nYou're 18. You need to be focused on establishing your own life and getting out of there. Yes, this will mean leaving your mom and dad on their own with brother.\n\nWhatever you do, don't let your future be put on hold by this situation.", "ia, when puberty hits OP's brother the situation could become very dangerous.", "Hey op, autism *is* genetic but it's usually caused by a combination of genes from both parents, not from one \"autism\" gene. It can also be caused by completely random mutations that show up in the sperm and/or egg that neither parent has (this may be as much as 10-20% of cases). Neither parent is \"at fault\", and I wonder if this contributes to why your mom babies him - that she feels guilty in some way for him having autism and so doesn't discipline. \n\nBut regardless of the cause, you are right that people with autism can indeed be parented, which is what is not happening at your mom's place. She's not setting him up for a life outside of her care, which he will eventually face. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Also I'm autistic but my presentation of it is very different from your brother's and my support needs are very different so I can't and won't try to speak for your brother. I only mention it because even as an autistic person I agree with you, it sounds like your parents never wanted to actually help or teach your brother anything and take his autism into account. Autistic people can and do learn things. Have they ever tried giving him an AAC device to communicate with? A lot of his emotional dysregulation could stem from not having a way to communicate. A lot of nonspeakers are neglected in this wat. It sounds like he needed not only AAC, but occupational therapy as a younger kid to help him with learning some skills for self care and emotional regulation. It's a form of neglect that your parents didn't try to do this for him. I feel for him and all of you who now can't have nice things now.", "NTA. You need to call CPS on this and/or go life with your father without your brother.", "Absolutely! I'm an autistic adult with 2 parents who aren't diagnosed officially but are totally on the spectrum. They raised me and my sibling and we both struggle of course bc the world isn't set up for us, but we are both doing well. It can totally be done.", "I would even argue that the different rules at each parents house, which is totally enough to unsettle a neurotypical kid, may be even more unsettling for a kid on the spectrum. Every kid is different but in general people with autism benefit from clear schedules, rules, and expectations (neurotypical kids do too ofc). \n\nBut I'm not an expert on treating kids with autism so op should take that with a grain of salt.", "You're actually pretty spot-on. Having to recalibrate to different rules at different adult homes is difficult for ND kids.", "NTA she\u2019s doing him more harm than good. And you might want to get rid of some parts. It violates the no violence rule", "NTA>  She is setting him up to be dependent his whole life.  People with Autism are often very teachable--especially routines.", "NTA wtf", "Yes she can call CPS on mom herself to report the abuse..", "You raise a very good point. The brother is obviously badly neglected and needs help.", "Also where a lot of kids like me (except even when my parents tried, I still didn't get a real diagnosis in a red state in the late 80s since I wasn't 'acting out') was when switching from a single classroom to jr. high and several different teachers who all taught differently.\n\nIn a single classroom, after the first couple months, I was generally able to figure out the cues and \"learn how to learn\" from the teacher. When it was suddenly understanding seven or eight teachers? Pain, anxiety (also undiagnosed, but I have quite the talent for it and have from at least 10-11 years old)...\n\nIt sounds like OPs brother might be able to improve quite a bit with a solid structure, but at his age and likely physical strength, I want OP and her sister the hell away from him, and I don't think his Mom has the brawn to take him on, he needs a professional facility at this point, but those aren't an easy find.", "NTA.  Can you move in with your father?  Your brother is becoming a physical threat to you and your things.", "NTA\u2026 is your brother at least getting the services he needs\u2026like speech therapy, ABA, etc?", "My brother is autistic and he is a very big guy. When I was 15, and he was 13, he punched me in the shoulder when my parents weren\u2019t home. He was taller and heavier than me and I had had enough. I called the police on him. They came and talked to him. I got in a lot of trouble with my parents BUT to my knowledge, he has never hit anyone since. \n\nUnfortunately, my parents have to deal with him the rest of their lives. He lives at home, throws tantrums when they can\u2019t afford to buy him whatever he wants, punches holes in walls, smells like he\u2019s not potty trained, smokes inside even when told not to\u2026 He\u2019s almost 7 feet tall and throws super scary tantrums. He will never hold a job. They can\u2019t even get him into a group home (I can\u2019t imagine he would fare well around people who won\u2019t give him anything he wants.) There is so much worse I can\u2019t even go into because I am not writing a book for a comment. \n\nI am so sorry. Your mom is probably going to pay for her lack of discipline for the rest of her life. My parents are both declining in health because of the stress my brother causes.

He is getting violent and it will get worse as he gets bigger.  You need to talk to your father about you and your sister\u2019s safety.  If he hits you and leaves marks, go show it to a school counselor if you are in the US as they should be a mandated reporter.  Your mother is doing all of you a disservice.  Next time he causes a problem you may want to ask her what is going to happen to him when she is no longer around?  What does she think will happen to an aggressive person with no income?

I love my brother and know he\u2019s very capable of learning because I\u2019ve seen it myself. He can be very loving and understanding but he doesn\u2019t cope well here since he knows he doesn\u2019t have to behave. \nI\u2019m only 18 but I constantly worry about the future and what will happen to my brother once my mother is unable to care for him, I told her I can\u2019t take on that responsibility if he\u2019s still this way when he\u2019s older. She just guilt trips me and says \u201coh so you just want him to go to a home?\u201d, I have many years until then, but it still lingers in my mind on what will happen.", "What plans have your parents made for your brother as they get older because they\u2019ll expect you to take him in. Watch out!", "Please don\u2019t listen to her guilt trips. Also be upfront and say \u2018yes I do. He needs specialist support and you need therapy as you cannot cope now already.\u2019 The more you (and your sister, get her in on this too) keep enforcing it vocally the easier it will be for you to keep the boundary.\n\nWhatever you do, keep saving money and make plans for your life as soon as you can. Even if it\u2019s community college first before going to a university to cut your debt or costs down. Same for your sister. Both of you need to hold the line and make plans for your futures. Your mother chooses to make a rod for her own back.\n\nYour mum will start piling on more guilt as she gets more and more burnt out from her inability to properly care for your brother (who really needs various therapies to engage him).
