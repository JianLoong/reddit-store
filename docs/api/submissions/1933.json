I've shared a profile with my girlfriend for several years and don't see any reason that I would need my own seperate profile.", "NTA. She sounds like a moocher. She should\u2019ve asked.", "NTA. That was so creepy of her", "NTA\n\nI share my Netflix account with my family... I'd be pissed if any of them tried to share it with someone else. I pay for the account because I want to do something nice for my family. Them inviting randoms in would make me feel like I'm being taken advantage of.", "NTA.\n\nShe just ran with it and didn't care. You can delete the profile.\n\nIt is weird not to ask first before making an profile. Entitled in my opinion. Only moochers does this and then expects just everyone else to deal with it.\n\nShe knows what she did, but calls you an AH.", "NTA. \n\nIt's incredibly weird and entitled to make your own profile on someone else's Netflix account without asking for and being granted permission. Like... I can't even imagine what went on in her mind that made her think that's okay. It's just basic etiquette NOT to do that. Is your girlfriend usually this entitled?", "NTA. It's pretty presumptuous for her to make her own profile on someone else's account", "NTA. My policy when it comes to this is that if you're not paying, you get no say in whether or not you have your own profile", "NTA. That's presumptive on her part.

Weird she did it. But just to clear up some of the comments, the number of profiles has nothing to do with the number of people who can watch at the same time.

We just have the name be (my name) + (his name)...", "NTA she could\u2019ve easily made the profile yours and hers together, my in laws Netflix has the whole family on in including my husband so we changed his account to both our names and picked out a funny profile character together.

I couldn't care less who sets up a profile.", "This might sound weird but.... ESH.\n\nIf it's not a big deal for you to have your own, then... Why not just have your own? Also, since it's not your account, shouldn't your brother be the one to say whether it's a problem? \n\nOn the flip side, profiles make sense to not mess up people's viewing history, or influence their suggestions (my former SIL was using mine to watch a lot of BS reality shows, and alllllll my suggestions or recommendations were messed up from it). However... For her to not confirm with either you or your brother that it was cool is a little forward, though.\n\nBasically the whole thing is a shit show", "YTA. It's such a small, minor thing to get pissy about.\n\nIf your brother doesn't want her to have a profile then just delete it. It really isn't worth making a big deal over.\n\nIt's just a separate watch history and recommendations list. It hurts no one to have a profile.", "NTA.  I'm not sure why she goes the \"petty asshole\" route and can't understand your reasoning.  She seems to be the one being petty.", "By weird do you mean entitled, rude,full of audacity?", "I had to physically make one for my MIL because she didn\u2019t want to impose. Please impose. You\u2019re ruining my queue.", "Surely if that profile stays there, the very next thing that happens is the account-holder-brother deletes both profiles and changes the password?", "My boyfriend and I have separate profiles because I enjoy some genres that he doesn't, and it's a lot easier to find the shows I'm watching without having to wade through all of his or our stuff.", "It keeps from interrupting someone\u2019s place if you watch the same stuff.

It's not like it changes my price, plus it keeps my stuff the way I want it", "All of that too, but also just plain weird.

That's the part that's missing from the story to me.", "I guess that's fair and I've ran into that issue with my girlfriend I just don't find it all that difficult to remeber what episode I was on and I've never heard her complain about it either. So I still stick with my stance that there is no way his gf needs her own profile on an account she isn't paying for.", "I asked my own sister before setting up a profile on her account. And unlike OPs girlfriend, I have met my sister.", "I haven't even made my own profile on my wife's netflix. Mostly because it's fun to occasionally pollute her profile with sci-fi b movies, but also because she hasn't invited me to do so.", "She\u2019s making him put to be a petty asshole. This  is only the beginning.", "Eh even if the brother doesn\u2019t care, I think it\u2019s fair for OP to care. That\u2019s just such a weirdly entitled thing to do \u2014 not major, but definitely bizarre.", "Right. OP told her she could use the account, why wouldn't she think OP's brother is ok with her using it?  I definitely wouldn't say it's inherently clear that permission to use it didn't include setting up her own profile to use while at his house. It's not like she took the login and added it at her own home, too.", "I take big breaks when binging shows so I need the reminder of where I was\n\nAlso your recommendations won't get flooded from people watching stuff you would never", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I\u2019m sure your bro will delete them moment he notices it", "Umm just delete the profile yourself and deny her access. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. You don\u2019t need her permission, the account is not hers. Or even have your brother delete it and reset the password. Geez it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nNTA", "NTA but she is.", "This. If I have a SO, and while at their house, they invite me to use their netflix account, I wouldnt think it weird to set up a profile, so I don't pollute their recommendations.   \n\n\nThat being said, I also wouldnt call somebody an asshole for asking me to use their profile and delete the one I set up.", "NTA your gf is an entitled B. It\u2019s your brothers account. You better handle this gas lighting bull \ud83d\udca9 cause she will turn you into a soggy dirty bath mat. Wet and stinking\ud83d\ude33", "NTA your gf is being very entitled. i think its even worse as she has never even met your brother.", "NTA", "My aunt does this to us instead of sharing with my uncle. She even has the nerve to have ago when you rent a film and delete it because she hasn't watched all.of it.", "YTA she wasn't messing with your view history, what's the problem...", "If I were to let my boyfriend use my Netflix profile, my algorithm would be ruined and stuffed full of WWII documentaries.", "She is crossing line and is acting like she own everything that's not her account and shouldn't do that! She show you her real personality so believe it ,talk to your brother that he must change his password, delete her profile and be sure she can't do it again behind your back !!\n\nMy own cousin give me his Netflix & Amazon account ,he create a profit for me and still I'm shy to use it!!", "NTA! As someone who pays for streaming services this pisses me off. I had Hulu and my SIL asked to watch a show. I said yes and before the week was out my husbands whole family had profiles. By Sunday I had changed the password. Your GF is rude and inconsiderate.", "NAH - what she did was certainly from a social perspective weird and a faux pass however it doesn\u2019t sound like she deleted anyones profile and as far as I\u2019m aware creating extra ones doesn\u2019t cost extra money it\u2019s extra screens that does so I\u2019m not sure what real harm was done here, equally having your own profile on Netflix isn\u2019t essential and asking someone to delete theirs when they\u2019re not paying isn\u2019t a big deal either. (so basically it\u2019s just very cringe)", "NTA. You\u2019re a petty asshole? No. The person who is complaining is though. Maybe she needs her own Netflix instead of poaching someone elses.", "My brothers tried this on my partners account so I changed the password and didn't let them back in. The audacity.", "Nta. When I give someone permission to use one of my streaming accounts I make them a profile. They use that profile and not one of them has given my password out. I know because I get an email everytime my info is used on a new device. Your gf sounds entitled and manipulative. Watch your back with that one. Gaslighting over a netflix profile, damn.", "Ppl still pay for netflix these days when theres torrents and smart tv apps to watch movies & tv shows for free?!", "NTA", "NTA. If she won\u2019t delete it put a password on the account so she can\u2019t use it if she says anything tell her your brother did it.", "Why spend money on a separate account when your brother is letting OP use it for free?\nIts a respect thing. You don't just create a profile on someone elses account. That's rude.", "It\u2019s not a big deal so she should just delete it. I wouldn\u2019t want my brother\u2019s first impression of my girlfriend to be that she behaves like a precocious little child - it\u2019s just a bit embarrassing for him and her.", "My sister has my Hulu account. So I think there were 4 profiles on it: me, her, her husband, and guest (so that way no one screws up my suggestions). She had a dog sitter stay at their house and instead of using the guest profile she made her own! Like you, my first thought was \"well that's weird\" and then also \"who the fuck is this\".", "My brother asked me if I wanted to join his and then created it for me.", "Yeah, nta.\nShe was rude. You don't make a profile on a streaming or gaming account that's not yours. You don't even ask to. Now, if the account owner makes you one, that's different. We've done that for fil on our streaming services. \nYour gf is being entitled. Log out of the service,  don't give her the password. Tell her she can get her own.", "NTA I wouldn't dream of just setting my own account up", "NTA. \n\nWhat she did was rude and entitled.", "Yta but not for asking her to delete the profile. Yta because you let someone else use the account your brother let you use for free.", "Have you met my 5yo niece? She has managed to set herself up with profiles on streaming services that I did not realise that I had.", "She didn\u2019t ask?
