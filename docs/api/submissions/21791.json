Pretty sure this is one of those areas where any well adjusted person would\u2019ve lied. But, that aside, did you even try to help them keep their venue?

You broke your cardinal rule of not working with family to do her a favor. Behavior such as this would never be acceptable under any professional circumstances.

But once you said yes, I think you could\u2019ve made a better effort to say,  I think you two  are a great couple and will last forever in a really convincing way. My guess is he said it somewhat sarcastically and your sister knew something was up. That said, I can see, stepping away from the planning, but still being the go-between for the venue. That could be your gift to her, even if she\u2019s being a jerk.", "INFO why did the argument with your sister instantly lead to you stepping down as wedding planner (knowing the venue situation)? Genuinely asking for your perspective. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest it seems a bit rushed being heat of the moment which makes it seem like a *potentially* petty move (as opposed to giving it a night to be sure of your course of action).

She pushed when you deferred.  The venue, however, was possibly something you could have still helped with as a wedding gift.  Now you need to be clear with your parents about your sister\u2019s behavior.", "ESH.

If she truly believed that your first answer in \"forever\" was true, she wouldn't have pushed to hear another answer.

Dumb as a post for giving her an honest answer to that question but not in the wrong. You gave her a palatable answer, she insisted on a different one, and you gave her what she asked for. Unwise but not in the wrong.\n\nAs for pulling out of the wedding, how could you possibly work with her now? So NTA for that either.", "NTA. Your sister pushed until she heard something she didn't want to hear. You tried avoiding it, tried telling her it would last forever, and tried changing the subject, no luck. She got mad when you told her the truth, which confirmed she's not ready for marriage. You handled yourself as gracefully as possible in a no-win situation, and no way should you have continued working with her.

No longer your problem.", "You probably shouldn't have even taken her as a client but she sounds pushy as hell so it makes sense. And whether she was a client she would have pushed you for an answer to that question. If you aren't great at lying she would have pushed and pushed until she felt she got a real answer from you so that was a no-win scenario as well. It's just a bad situation all around. I don't blame you for pulling out. How can you represent her if the relationship has turned this toxic? You can't so this is the only thing that can be done. The best you could do is communicate to her that you don't truly have the ability to predict how every relationship will end up and that she is acting ridiculous pretending that you have cursed her future marriage. It's also on her for pushing you to give an answer to that question. She sounds exhausting.", "I'd say you're only the AH if you deliberately made sure the venue wouldn't work with her-- since they'd already had her on the books, that is the \"existing relationship\".\n\nMore importantly, please share your compatibility indicators for us plebes.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a playful question. She was badgering you.", "Oh, you know you're here because YTA. \n\nSeriously dude, you work in event planning and you haven't learned how to graciously lie? This is not the  \"Was I Correct?\" Sub. This is AITA. \n\nI did 20 years in hospo and ran a wedding venue for a couple of those years and you and I both know that a positive lie trumps the truth with every bride when it comes to this kind of question. \n\nIs this really the bridge you want to burn with family? Because you are being an AH here.", "NTA she was childish and annoying. She can tell whatever lie she wants to others oh well.", "NTA she really wanted to know so can\u2019t throw a toddler tantrum when she gets the answer.  She screwed up her own plans and you are under no obligation to supply your professional services to her.", "Never ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer.", "YTA, that's your sister, you fucking lie about your dumb \"party trick\" \nits a judgey asshole thing to do to anyone, bite your slithery little tongue", "NTA.  But I really would like to know the behaviors and incidences that led to the 1.5 yr prediction. Please?", "YTA\n\nDid it occur to you that your sister might have had worries or concerns and was questioning you about it because she thought you might be able to help?\n\nInstead of handling it with empathy you drop 1.5 years on her without providing her any support.\n\nYou could have kept lying if you didn't want to get drawn in, or said something like \"you know I think you'll be together long enough that my predictions get inaccurate.\"\n\nAlso when you noticed all these 'signs' that mean she wouldn't last more than 2 years did you think to raise any of those concerns with her? I get not doing that for a regular client but she's family.\n\nLastly YTA for even making predictions about your clients at all. If I had learnt my wedding planner was known for doing that I wouldn't hire them and would advise anyone else to steer clear.

I can sympathize with this person, and I do, but laughing about this story is how I cope with the utter terror of being helpless behind that door.\n\nAnd you\u2019ve never mentioned - without identifying details - any of these things to close confidants or family? \n\nWhen I was in school, we were taught that this is why therapists need therapists.

But I\u2019ve also been on the other side of terrible bedside manner and even medical treatment from doctors who were human and maybe having bad days. But there\u2019s a line of what\u2019s acceptable. I also grew up starting in the medical field in a small town before my disabilities took over, so I\u2019ve also heard horrible shit from former classmates who\u2019s care I\u2019ve been under (and then removed myself from their care) because I also could figure out some of the people they were talking about", "I think when the industry is marriage, discussing when you think the couple will divorce counts as bad mouthing", "Also, you just reminded me of the time where I went to talk with a patient in their room and they told me \u201cI don\u2019t even know who you are but FUCK YOUUUUUU\u201d LOL I just remember standing there like \ud83d\ude00", "Agree! Nothing is better than having a pt really make you question your own sanity and going to therapy that week to let it all out. The best part for me is getting the wisdom my therapist has from her many many years of experience. Like you said, every psych professional seriously should have their own therapist. It\u2019s an extremely emotionally demanding profession \u2014 and you can\u2019t care for your patients if you yourself aren\u2019t doing so hot.", "Gossiping about a client and talking to therapists about clients are two entirely different things.", "Then do it in therapy. That's what therapy is for. I have tons of friends in the medical field, and those who have trouble dealing with the emotional toll it takes are in therapy. They don't just rag on patients to other people. \nThere are ways to keep your sanity in healthy and productive ways that don't involve airing out client/patient info, even anonymously.\n\nThe problem is that people who resent their patients tend not to be good doctors. Bedside manner and the ability to empathize is a HUGE fundamental part of being good in those types of jobs. That's why that whole group of nurses got fired for randomly bitching about patients on tiktok. It doesn't matter that they didn't name the patients directly. It's wildly unprofessional and disrespectful and sets up a basis for their patients not to trust them. And if patients can't trust you, then you can't be good at your job.", "She probably wouldn\u2019t have been happy with that either", "I'm def agreeing with everything you've said. Also in my line of work firing a client we would still at least try to set them up with someone else.", "I don't know. Account has top tier comments on the page. Made my spidey senses tingle, though.", "Either way the person I replied to was saying it should be \"her parents\" instead of \"his parents\", and I was just pointing out why that's silly", "Came here to say exactly this, and I don't think it's a bullshit answer either. I've got a pretty good read on people right after I meet them, but don't ask me to do the same read on my fam--even if I were so inclined, the lack of perspective makes it a difficult read indeed.", "Because for OP it's his real life and not us anonymously armchair judging?? Giving the actual answer was never going to be a not stupid thing to do.", "If he doesn't know how to talk to stressed out, unreasonable brides, he's in the wrong line of work", "Its still a professional setting, even if it is the sister. Say you were a wedding planner, would seriously give a real answer to your client if they asked you that question?", "But also, don't answer questions in a way that could destroy your relationship with your sister/ client.  Seriously, there are better ways to handle this.", "OP don't you think you're kind of putting your livelihood at risk here? You say it's your \"party trick\" meaning you've gained a bit of a reputation for it among your friends. If this spreads and you become known as such in the industry, I can very well see you losing clients because of this. No one actually *wants* to work with someone who says such tacky things. This is something you confide in maybe your spouse or just one other person. Not to a group so much so that you develop a reputation for it as your party trick. I think both you and your sister are equally immature and short sighted.", "\"this is something I've shared with close friends and family only\" \n\nI believe that about as much as your sister believed \"forever\".", "Then you\u2019re also very unprofessional", "Yeah I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s in the right here what so ever, but even if this situation didn\u2019t happen the way he conducts himself regarding his clients is still AH behavior.", "True, but I was specifically referring to the other commenter saying he should have used tactful dishonesty, as though he hadn't tried that already. Personally, I prefer your idea. No dishonesty and very tactful.", "Equally as easy for the sister to stop pushing the question? This was a business relationship and as such should be held to business etiquette", "What is tactful dishonesty if not a lie?", "\"No\" is a full sentence. \n\nOr don't have conversations bad mouthing your clients in front of your friends and family in the first place. \n\nImagine if a realtor went back from closing a house and said \"I bet they'll lose it to foreclosure within five years.\" \n\nImagine if a doctor let a patient out and turned to her nurse and said \"I bet he'll have diabetes before the end of the year.\" \n\nImagine a teacher with a difficult student, in the teacher's lounge betting on who will end up in prison. \n\nI am sure shitty realtors, doctors and teachers all do this. But it's pretty awful. Just because you see awful things happen in your profession doesn't mean you need to joke about it. \n\n(I was a teacher with many students who ended up in prison. It breaks my heart, I know the education system sets them up for incarceration, and I don't take that lightly. On my worst day, when I had students assault me, scream at me, steal from me, I didn't joke about who was going to prison. In fact I had to file a police report for the student who stole from me, and it was really awful to know that I might be the first in a LONG line of interactions with the justice system. And that former student is in prison. And so I'm especially glad I didn't take it lightly)", "He literally did lie, and then she kept pushing.", "I have a child with severe cognitive and physical disabilities, who is also medically fragile. If it helps her nurses to joke about us, so they take better care of her tomorrow, I\u2019m okay with that. I need them to take good care of her, and being in a good place mentally is an important part of that. \n\nI do think doctors/therapists/etc need to be very careful about privacy. And should be extremely careful that it never gets back to clients/patients. But venting is important for mental health. That\u2019s why therapists have therapists; no one can carry that burden inside forever and still function.", "The person I initially responded to did not indicate such a differentiation. If I missed such an implication, I apologize.", "He said it would last forever first! After that, there's no good answer. What could he possibly have said that would have made her happy?", "As someone who has worked in wedding-adjacent fields: Dealing with stressed out, unreasonable brides *who you are related to* is a whole different thing.", "Appreciate the advice, really. I think people are getting the impression from this short snippet that I'm known among at least a dozen people for this \"trick\" of mine, when it's really just my husband, my immediate family, and  two other friends. It's on the same level as an inside joke or some sort of trivial fact about my life only people close to me know. I have never been worried about it getting out or hurting me professionally until this situation, where I broke my own rule and took on someone I know personally as a client. I don't think my sister would ever try to hurt me like that, but you never know. \n\nLuckily, I'm very trusted by those who I work with. Someone spreading some kind of negative information about me would, thankfully, be counteracted by the many people who have had overwhelmingly positive experiences with me in the past, who have recommended me to their friends.\n\nStill, I can see why people might assume that this is in poor taste. It's not something that comes up often, it was genuinely just me being surprised that my intuition was right multiple times. I don't think there's any way for my reputation to be hurt over it, but I also can see why it comes across nasty when it's being read as me boasting about this 'talent' of mine, like I whip out my phone to show it off whenever I'm in a group setting. That certainly isn't the case. It's my bad for not thinking up a more accurate term other than party trick. I hope this clears things up.", "Right. Depending on the size of their client pool, all it takes is one friend with a propensity for gossip to drop a story about OPs 'party trick' to the wrong ears and boom they have a reputation.\n\nEdit- pronoun", "You sound very naive. People talk; that is the nature of human beings.\n\nYou made your point to OP, and that is normal. The way you keep following up with OP to make the same point over and over and over and over and over again is not normal. It's like your mind can't process that people talk (even professionals).", "Do you think it is proper business etiquette for a wedding planner to tell his client her marriage will fall apart in 18 months? \n\nIf that\u2019s OP\u2019s genuine opinion, he should be trying to keep his sister from making a massive mistake - not literally planning the wedding.", "I think maybe you replied to the wrong person. Great post though! I agree completely. If people want to talk trash in private, that\u2019s their prerogative. Doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t assholes but whatever, no big deal. But under no circumstances is it ever appropriate to say these things directly to your client/patient/student.", "So keep lying? Holy shit you guys must be awful at customer relations.", "I think there\u2019s a line for sure, like it\u2019s been so rare I\u2019ve dealt with that treatment for my son, but he\u2019s also a little kid still. His professionals joke and vent but the *way* they do it, is key. They have top tier manners in that aspect and one thing I loved when I was an older kid in pediatrics. But in the past when it has come to his professionals that work with all ages of people with intellectual disabilities, some have struggled to presume competence with him and have been downright rude.\n\nKinda funny, the next post I saw after this was about a doctors spouse who turned his wife in because she was venting, and eventually it crossed the line like my former classmates. I was actually going to comment there and say that spouses is exactly where I feel the line should be drawn for this type of thing (or with whoever is your most immediate, trusted support person) and that also it shouldn\u2019t cross into the line where people could recognize that person. \n\nYou definitely need to take care of your own mental health though. Venting can be a part of that, but I\u2019ve heard \u201cventing\u201d from medical professionals that has gotten into just being downright nasty and horrible that has actually made me avoid seeking care at certain places. I feel like in certain professions, even in venting about your job there\u2019s a level of dignity that should be preserved when talking about the people you\u2019re caring for. I just can\u2019t imagine the complaining and loathing I\u2019ve heard from some people always transfers over into good care for those they are speaking about. My specific life situations have definitely influenced my thinking on this though", "its common sense though.", "Which is a very easy thing to say when it's not your life. Giving the real answer, no matter if the person asked for it, could potentially damage any future relationship he hoped to have with his family. \n\nI'm not saying what he did was wrong - just that he has to deal with a lot more drama now that he responded that way.", "Exactly! Whenever people ask me for my opinion, I ask them if they really want it, or do they want me to tell them what I think they want to hear.", "OP, don't listen to the nutters on here. They have no idea what it's like to be in a situation as a professional and see people at their best and worst. I am an ICU nurse. I can honestly say there is something similar in healthcare. Just try and support your sister and definitely put the wedding debate behind you. It sounds like you love your sister, so I think you just scared her. She wanted your opinion because she cares, but didn't really want the truth. Find a way to apologize and reassure her that in learning the faults in their marriage, they now have the ability to build stronger than ever.", "Exactly.  One correction- OP is a man.", "All it takes is for the sister to blast the Op on social media and it being shared enough.", "Customer relations? lol what\n\nIf you keep pushing for an answer because you didn't like the first one, you're gonna get an answer you don't like and you're a dumb asshole if you get mad about it.", "I agree with all of this. Thank you for saying everything better than I could.", "\"But the professionals I know never spill any wacky stories about their field\" - nah they just don't know them well enough or they aren't the sharing type.\n\neveryone I've met in service or care related industries I've gotten close to or worked with has wacky client stories. it's just the way of the world. people are just careful about who they share with. the people who think no controlled gossip happens might be the ones that all us professional tea spillers know are too uncontrolled to trust with gossip", "The way OPs sister is reacting this might be in his future", "It\u2019s his job. And it\u2019s his sister. Absolute asshole behavior."]}
