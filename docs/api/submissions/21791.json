Pretty sure this is one of those areas where any well adjusted person would\u2019ve lied. But, that aside, did you even try to help them keep their venue?

You broke your cardinal rule of not working with family to do her a favor. Behavior such as this would never be acceptable under any professional circumstances.

But once you said yes, I think you could\u2019ve made a better effort to say,  I think you two  are a great couple and will last forever in a really convincing way. My guess is he said it somewhat sarcastically and your sister knew something was up. That said, I can see, stepping away from the planning, but still being the go-between for the venue. That could be your gift to her, even if she\u2019s being a jerk.", "INFO why did the argument with your sister instantly lead to you stepping down as wedding planner (knowing the venue situation)? Genuinely asking for your perspective. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest it seems a bit rushed being heat of the moment which makes it seem like a *potentially* petty move (as opposed to giving it a night to be sure of your course of action).

She pushed when you deferred.  The venue, however, was possibly something you could have still helped with as a wedding gift.  Now you need to be clear with your parents about your sister\u2019s behavior.", "ESH.

If she truly believed that your first answer in \"forever\" was true, she wouldn't have pushed to hear another answer.

Dumb as a post for giving her an honest answer to that question but not in the wrong. You gave her a palatable answer, she insisted on a different one, and you gave her what she asked for. Unwise but not in the wrong.\n\nAs for pulling out of the wedding, how could you possibly work with her now? So NTA for that either.", "NTA. Your sister pushed until she heard something she didn't want to hear. You tried avoiding it, tried telling her it would last forever, and tried changing the subject, no luck. She got mad when you told her the truth, which confirmed she's not ready for marriage. You handled yourself as gracefully as possible in a no-win situation, and no way should you have continued working with her.

No longer your problem.", "You probably shouldn't have even taken her as a client but she sounds pushy as hell so it makes sense. And whether she was a client she would have pushed you for an answer to that question. If you aren't great at lying she would have pushed and pushed until she felt she got a real answer from you so that was a no-win scenario as well. It's just a bad situation all around. I don't blame you for pulling out. How can you represent her if the relationship has turned this toxic? You can't so this is the only thing that can be done. The best you could do is communicate to her that you don't truly have the ability to predict how every relationship will end up and that she is acting ridiculous pretending that you have cursed her future marriage. It's also on her for pushing you to give an answer to that question. She sounds exhausting.", "I'd say you're only the AH if you deliberately made sure the venue wouldn't work with her-- since they'd already had her on the books, that is the \"existing relationship\".\n\nMore importantly, please share your compatibility indicators for us plebes.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a playful question. She was badgering you.", "Oh, you know you're here because YTA. \n\nSeriously dude, you work in event planning and you haven't learned how to graciously lie? This is not the  \"Was I Correct?\" Sub. This is AITA. \n\nI did 20 years in hospo and ran a wedding venue for a couple of those years and you and I both know that a positive lie trumps the truth with every bride when it comes to this kind of question. \n\nIs this really the bridge you want to burn with family? Because you are being an AH here.", "NTA she was childish and annoying. She can tell whatever lie she wants to others oh well.", "NTA she really wanted to know so can\u2019t throw a toddler tantrum when she gets the answer.  She screwed up her own plans and you are under no obligation to supply your professional services to her.", "Never ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer.", "YTA, that's your sister, you fucking lie about your dumb \"party trick\" \nits a judgey asshole thing to do to anyone, bite your slithery little tongue", "NTA.  But I really would like to know the behaviors and incidences that led to the 1.5 yr prediction. Please?", "YTA\n\nDid it occur to you that your sister might have had worries or concerns and was questioning you about it because she thought you might be able to help?\n\nInstead of handling it with empathy you drop 1.5 years on her without providing her any support.\n\nYou could have kept lying if you didn't want to get drawn in, or said something like \"you know I think you'll be together long enough that my predictions get inaccurate.\"\n\nAlso when you noticed all these 'signs' that mean she wouldn't last more than 2 years did you think to raise any of those concerns with her? I get not doing that for a regular client but she's family.\n\nLastly YTA for even making predictions about your clients at all. If I had learnt my wedding planner was known for doing that I wouldn't hire them and would advise anyone else to steer clear.

I think your odds of forever are pretty good.", "Eh, with an attitude like that, she probably won't make it to the altar.", "I assume they meant \u201cher\u201d as in her parents.", "He tried changing the subject then when pressed lied with the only acceptable answer to that question and then she wouldn\u2019t settle for that even.\n\nWhat was he supposed to say? 5 years, a decade, twenty years and he\u2019ll ditch you for a 20 something when he has his midlife crisis?\n\nSeriously what was the sister hoping for. She was an insufferable idiot, asked a question she didn\u2019t want the answer to then refused to accept the placating answer.\n\nNTA- this is all on her. This is why you don\u2019t work with people you know personally. You had a very good reason for that policy. She proved it by being an idiot.\n\nKinda a side trip but I\u2019m curious:\n\nIf you have a friend/family member that your trick tells you their relationship will actually go the distance would you do that wedding?\n\nI\u2019m just curious.", "The graceful non-answer might have been something like \"Oh, I can't do it with people I *know*; I can't see them objectively.\"", "i think it's particularly sad that the sister did not think the answer of forever was true... it's very telling that she doesn't even have faith in her own relationship..... so like... why is she even getting married in the first place?", "She wasn't telling her the truth, she was telling her an extremely nasty opinion. There are thousands of ways to deflect or have a heart to heart about the weaknesses of their relationship. But instead, OP acts like a snarky sibling. ESH.", "I concur. I am a professional musician who plays piano and organ for 25-30 wedding ceremonies per year. I\u2019m in my 40s and have been doing this since I was a teenager. I\u2019ve learned to read the patterns and I know if a marriage is going to last or not with frightening accuracy. I\u2019m so good at predicting that a few ministers/priests I work with will ask me after the the wedding rehearsal \u201cso is this going to last?\u201d And like OP, I *refuse* to do music for family/close friends weddings for this very reason: too many bride/groom/MOB/MOG-zillas.", "OP is not a professional on relationships he is an event planner. He has no reason to even know when these divorces happen. But for some reason he checks", "Because he never should have bragged about his \u201cability\u201d in the first place. Then she never would have asked. It\u2019s crass and it just causes problems.", "But then 18 months later when her marriage goes under she\u2019ll complain and say \u201cbut you said we\u2019d be together for 10+ years!!!\u201d\n\nShe sounds like a nightmare. I wouldn\u2019t want to get drinks to tell her about all the red flags, because chances are most of them are coming from her. Would you? Sounds like only downside and no upside to me", "Because when they split up in a year and a half she'll wail to him \"But you told me we'd be together for forty years\".", "I doubt he tells his other clients the estimate..  \nhe said it's his party trick, not part of his professional MO. From a business standpoint, it would be extremely stupid to tell your clients \"yeah you're paying me money for a wedding but you're probably gonna divorce in a year. Anyway, what flowers should we go for?\"", "I have never \"gone after\" my clients' relationships. I certainly have never called one of my clients a homewrecker. Spotting warning signs that things might not last is something everyone in my industry does. It's not malicious.\n\nI definitely made a mistake by telling my sister the length of relationship I predicted. I was flustered and let my emotions get the better of me, which is very unlike me and something I really regret. I'm usually juggling 5 things at once as it is, but this got to me. Still. I wouldn't label what I do as \"going after\" anyone's relationship.", "The most Reddit comment ever made", "That would've ended in the same petty fight \ud83e\udd23", "I do know what you mean and I dont think any answer would have worked for her because the minute he said \u201cno\u201d she was convinced he didnt think that it would last and thats why he didnt want to do it. \n\nIf he was going to lie he should have lied first but seeing how she is acting I just dont know if any answer would have been good lie or not. I dont even know WHY she would ask.", "This was great to read", ">What was he supposed to say?\n\nProbably \"I've told you I'm not going to answer that and if you ask again I will no longer be involved in planning your wedding\"\n\nNot that she deserves the better answer, just that it would have been one", "Yeah it sounds like OP did their best to be respectful. Sure they could have refused to answer, but the sister strikes me as the type that would literally never let it go. She\u2019d probably continually harass OP about it", "Even with the sister pushing, there was definitely a more graceful way of handling the situation, such as what you wrote", "I agree, there should have been a way around answering that.  Telling your sister her marriage will only last a year and a half is rough!", "OP is a man", "Found the sister lmfaooo", "Dude he tried to \"deflect a thousand times\" and even gave her the \"correct\" answer first, her fault she refused to accept it and kept bothering him about it", "I dont see it as crass but I do get why other people would see it that way and thats why he doesnt work with family/friends.", "Yeah, plus op says the sister has a word or two to be able to say about op\u2019s marriage and homewrecking?? You know what they say about stones and glass houses.", ">spottk warning signs that things might not last is something everyone in my industry does\n\nNot everyone in your industry uses it as a \u2018party trick\u2019 I know a wedding videographer and a florist.

He also spent 15 minutes deflecting while she pushed the familial boundary onto his professional life.", "Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to.", "Sister probably knows the planner was her brother though.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason he doesn\u2019t work with family and friends. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any shame, since all his family and friends know about this trick.", "I would say that both of those professions involve less access to the innerworkings of their clients mutual decision making skills than mine does, but I'm sure they still have thoughts about the couples they work with.\n\nEither way, this is something I've shared with close friends and family only. It's not me going up to people's faces and directly criticizing their relationship. Those are two very different things, and I don't know how else to point out the difference. I'm also not giggling with my friends about relationships ending - I was simply shocked the first few times I got the timing so closely and shared it with people close with me. My intentions were never to make this my thing. It just comes with the territory of my job, truly.", "I guess no one ever really *owes* anyone grace, but telling your sister you think her marriage is doomed is a pretty unkind thing to do (which, preemptively, is not saying I think the sister wasn't also being an AH here).", "You could be right but based on the post it seems to me because his family/friends know he does this \u201ctrick\u201d is why he doesnt work with them because they will indeed ask him just like his sister did. I do agree his family/friends shouldn\u2019t even know about his \u201cability\u201d because how/why would this even come up to them. \n\nIf its an industry thing he should keep it to just his collegues or to himself whatever. I just dont think its a big deal since he isnt taking bets on couples or telling the couples his predictions, but again I fully understand why it would be seen that way to others and going forward he should keep it to himself.", "> My intentions were never to make this my thing.

This is one of those things you can MAYBE talk to your spouse about but never should have gone further than that.
