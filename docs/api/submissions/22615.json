Here\u2019s some back story: Me and my brother come from a comfortable family and it was pretty known that one day he\u2019d take over the family firm. But that didn\u2019t happen because my brother wanted to be an engineer so I stepped in to fill his spot, it wasn\u2019t on purpose I just enjoyed the family business. \n\nI also invested in a lot of things and have multiple streams of income. My wife comes from an unfortunate background so I like to fulfill a lot of her childhood dreams. I love to see her face when I take her new places and buy her new things. And I honestly think that what\u2019s she deserves, she\u2019s worked hard her whole life and I just wanna make the rest of her life easier. I don\u2019t wanna burden her with things she\u2019s dealt with as a child. And my wife also struggles with mental health and I treasure taking her on vacation or sending her on one so she can have a break from her mind. \n\nLook I am obsessed with my wife okay. And I know sometimes I can go overboard but it\u2019s a way of me expressing my love language. I send her flowers because she loves them, our wedding was wild flower themed. So last Sunday was our wedding Anniversary so yes I filled our house with wildflowers. Yes that seems dramatic but my wife loved it so I don\u2019t care. \n\nMy family came over and made us dinner to celebrate our Anniversary. It was a great time I enjoyed sharing this with my family. Until I stepped away to talk with my brother. I will say we had a few drinks and yes we know how to put it down we\u2019re Italian. We start having a civil conversation about our wives. It was fine until my brother said \u201cYou spoil your wife way to much my wife think it\u2019s to compensate for a bad marriage.\u201d \n\nOF course I was pissed, and on all days he had to say it on my anniversary. I snapped, I told him to F off and if his wife and him think like this they\u2019re no longer welcome in my home or around my wife. Him and his wife eventually left but not without a fight. My SIL shouted at my family saying \u201cI don\u2019t know we treat that outsider like family.\u201d My mother was pissed probably more than my wife. And her comment I don\u2019t know if it was racist(my wife is black) or classiest I\u2019m starting to think a mixture of both. \n\nBut anyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1689730603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153gz83/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_f_off_because_he/", "score": 276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But anyways NTA, it\u2019s nice to see someone on this platform, who actually like their wife", "Absolutely NTA.  Where, how, on what or on whom you spend your money is YOUR business.

That's all that matters.", "NTA\n\nYou keep doing what you're doing and ignore the haters. Sounds like pure jealousy from your bro and SIL to me", "NTA. Your relationship is not anyone's business!
