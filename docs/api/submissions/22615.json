My wife comes from an unfortunate background so I like to fulfill a lot of her childhood dreams. I love to see her face when I take her new places and buy her new things. And I honestly think that what\u2019s she deserves, she\u2019s worked hard her whole life and I just wanna make the rest of her life easier. I don\u2019t wanna burden her with things she\u2019s dealt with as a child.

And I know sometimes I can go overboard but it\u2019s a way of me expressing my love language. I send her flowers because she loves them, our wedding was wild flower themed. So last Sunday was our wedding Anniversary so yes I filled our house with wildflowers. Yes that seems dramatic but my wife loved it so I don\u2019t care. \n\nMy family came over and made us dinner to celebrate our Anniversary. It was a great time I enjoyed sharing this with my family.

It was fine until my brother said \u201cYou spoil your wife way to much my wife think it\u2019s to compensate for a bad marriage.\u201d \n\nOF course I was pissed, and on all days he had to say it on my anniversary. I snapped, I told him to F off and if his wife and him think like this they\u2019re no longer welcome in my home or around my wife. Him and his wife eventually left but not without a fight. My SIL shouted at my family saying \u201cI don\u2019t know we treat that outsider like family.\u201d My mother was pissed probably more than my wife.

If seeing your wife happy makes you happy then I don't see the problem.  You like to shower your wife bc it makes her feel good which in turn makes you feel good.

I didn't have the best childhood and my husband has given me so many memories that will last forever. I love the gifts he gives me because he makes them sure they're personal to me. Keep being an amazing husband.", "NTA\n\nMy husband knew that I wanted a Smart Car, so when they came out, we did all of the research, and he bought one. When my mother asked why he bought me a new car, he said quite simply, \"Because she wanted it.\" I was incredibly spoiled and loved every moment of it, though I do like to think that I spoiled him right back as best I could. Cherish every second of spoiling your wife. The time goes by all too fast. \n\nLife is too short to deal with racist, classist AHs.", "NTA. You being extra attentive to your gift giving in regards to wife (getting her things because you want to bring her joy, celebrating your anniversaries in a special way, being happy when you make her happy) and that is a special thing. If your brother only thinks of his wife when he doesn't something to shame her, or to apologize to her, that's his problem. \n\nI have friends that go overboard with each other. It's lovely to see. He did go so overboard one time because he was apologizing for something that she asked him to cool it for a while while they worked through some stuff. They are back to their normal which is overboard for some and probably around the same level of gift/joy giving you give your wife.", "NTA\n\nI feel like there's defs a race thing at play here, but the main vibe I'm getting is that your SIL is complaining to your brother about how \"OP's wife gets to do X, Y and Z, I guess you don't love me enough to do that for me....\" or that \"all the gifts MUST mean he beats her or cheats on her\" because God forbid you do something nice for your wife!\n\nI'm glad you can do nice things for her dude, sorry people can't deal with your success.", "NTA\n\nNot only is your brother and SIL AH's, they sound like jealous racist ones at that. Something tells me SIL nags her husband because he doesn't treat her even a quarter of the way OP does to his wife.", "NTA. But lets address the elephant in the room, your SIL is racist.\n\nFrom what she said and acted, unless she's your cousin, she's an outsider to the family as well.\n\nHopefully once you get married that changes, but if she feels your wife isn't \"family\", theres a reason.\n\nBoth your brother and SIL can fuck off with that attitude.", "Lol he\u2019s actually allergic to sea food", "Yes my wife is in therapy and sometimes we have sessions together. She\u2019s been in therapy ever since I\u2019ve known her.", "SIL has begun to realize that you have more money than her husband and is jealous.", "My husband has started a new thing where he brags out right to my mother in law about the kind gestures or gifts he gets me. We started noticing that because I was in graduate school making less and he was making 5X my salary that she made snide comments about our income difference. We also picked up on the fact that she was likely jealous that my husband had no qualms being romantic and still taking care of me, nor if I spent OUR money on things for the home or gifts for him either, since my father in law seems to think she should be grateful to be around him.\n\nSo, for example, I reorganized the whole closet. He said on the phone to her I was bringing my clothes back in. \u201cOh, you mean your clothes, since you definitely paid for them too.\u201d Before I flew off the handle he said \u201cWell, she always seems to look better than I do so I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d Or, she noticed I had a designer hand bag for Christmas. She made a comment and he came around the corner and grabbed my phone and said \u201cLook! I made sure the bag matched her new leather case for her new phone she needed too! Isn\u2019t it so pretty?\u201d\n\nMaybe just start bragging about your wife and the way you treat her. Because now it just brings petty joy.", "Well, you deserve, no earn, the honor of each other.\n\nI can't believe how lucky I've gotten... I'm not easy to live with... she has her warts too, but she works them. I try too...", "Even better! Problem solves itself.", "I would tell him how much this pains you, how much you were hurt by his comments, how much you look up to him but ultimately you can\u2019t be disrespected like that. I would be clear with how much he means to you but you and your wife\u2019s relationship is out of bounds\u2026", "NTA-- defend your wife. Go off. Do not put up with disrespect in your own house. Maybe SIL thinks it's overcompensation because she gets nothing from her husband and sees that as a norm. You continue to spoil your wife (as long as it's in your means) and F the haters... also seems the family has your back so go LC with brother until they apologize", "Wife is jealous and brother looks bad but instead of stepping up he sides w wife. Easier to say you spoil too much instead of the truth of him never showing effort in his own house", "your relationship with your wife sounds great and healthy, you love her and she loves you and if you two are happy that way, then your brother should keep his comments to himself and your SIL sounds like a goddamn racist.\n\nNTA, maybe keep your brother at an arm's length.", "NTA at all. But your family is...They owe you and your wife an apology.", "NTAH...", "Geez, 100% NTA. It sounds like u and your wife have a lovely relationship! \n\nYour brother and SIL\u2019s comments were perfectly awful, and demonstrate that THEY are the ones with issues, not u.", "NTA. I think it's gross that your brother sees your genuine love and devotion for your wife and thinks it's hiding something. That says a lot about him. Good for you standing your ground, continue to spoil your wife it's your life and no one should tell you how to live it. I spoil my wife like crazy too and it brings me so much joy to see her smile.", "NTA you sound like a treasure of a husband and your brother and his wife are both racist and jealous. They can\u2019t fathom a Black woman getting all the love and adoration you give your wife. They are disgusting. \n\nMay you and your wife have a lifetime of fun over the top fairytale romantic gestures.", "**Your Brothers wife is jealous.**\n\nShe probably is upset her husband doesn't treat her the way you treat your fiance. So she has brought it up to him, and your brother is probably playing it off as your over compensating for something, as he doesn't want to put in the same effort. So he's mad at you for making him 'look bad'. \n\nBasically, they are upset because they are comparing their lives to yours and instead of being happy for what they have, they are miserable about what they don't have.", "NTA.. they jelous.. go ahead and live your great life with your great wife.", "NTA.  Brother is pissed because you're making him look bad, and his wife is insanely jealous.", "Nta. Turns out my sister said some similar things to my mother. My mother told me. Ex. We go out to eat too much. We go to Disney too much and Disney is stupid. My sister also called me out for buying an Apple Watch in our friend group chat because I should be saving money (we were building a house.)\n\nI was upset and distanced myself from my sister and her husband. Turns out it was jealousy because their marriage wasn\u2019t good. Several months later they got divorced. \n\nDon\u2019t take it personally. Happy anniversary! October is our 3rd marriage anniversary and 6th dating anniversary. \n\n- from a spoiled wife that is \u201cobsessed\u201d with her husband", "NTA, the way you talk about your wife and the joy it brings you to make her happy is so wholesome.", "Nta. You do you. None of their business.", "I think it is more racism-- like I hear it as being implied within the Italian community. But I could be wrong.", "Yes, anyone who says \u201cwe don\u2019t do things for each other because our marriage is strong\u201d is hoping to fool people.\n\nOP isn\u2019t just spending money, either \u2014 the wildflowers were thoughtful, and thoughtfulness is a pillar of a strong marriage.", "All of that. Jealousy is such a disease. \nI\u2019m so glad he stood up for your wife. I know it means a lot to her.", "DING, DING, DING.....\n\nGive the lady a prize!", "Love your husband's petty LOL", "It can be both--people with one prejudice are often open to others.", "[removed]", "NTA- your brother and his wife are just mad that your brother would have never ever even thought about doing such a lovely gesture for his wife.\n\nAlso who does your sil Think she is trying to monitor who your family treats as family.

You sound like an absolutely wonderful husband and your wife is super lucky to have someone so thoughtful!", "It really wasn't his business to say in your relationship unless it was detrimental.\n\nNTA", "Darling, your SIL is *jealous AF* and your brother is mad that you are so awesome bc he thinks it makes him look bad. \n\nThe only advice I\u2019d give is next time just blow it off instead of blowing up. A simple \u201coh\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s nice\u201d would have been a better response. \n\nYour relationship is solid and you have nothing to react about, esp not to some obviously dying-of-envy jerk!", "Definitely NTA. Seems like brothers wife is jealous she doesn't get spoiled like that. You keep doing you and making your wife's dreams come true.", "NTA. That's just adorable with all the flowers.", "NTA. You keep treating your wife in the way that makes you both happy!", "I think the 'outsider' here refers to ethnicity.

I would hope they would understand the explanation you gave us instead of that weird racist/classist/something-ist response that came out of your SIL, exposing her for the jealous bigot she is.", "You have your wife's back and a shiny backbone. Both good things. I am glad your mom objected to her mistreatment as well. NTA and AWWWW! At you and your wife. It is super sweet that want her to know the joy and happiness she was deprived of for so long.
