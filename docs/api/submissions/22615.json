Here\u2019s some back story: Me and my brother come from a comfortable family and it was pretty known that one day he\u2019d take over the family firm. But that didn\u2019t happen because my brother wanted to be an engineer so I stepped in to fill his spot, it wasn\u2019t on purpose I just enjoyed the family business. \n\nI also invested in a lot of things and have multiple streams of income. My wife comes from an unfortunate background so I like to fulfill a lot of her childhood dreams. I love to see her face when I take her new places and buy her new things. And I honestly think that what\u2019s she deserves, she\u2019s worked hard her whole life and I just wanna make the rest of her life easier. I don\u2019t wanna burden her with things she\u2019s dealt with as a child. And my wife also struggles with mental health and I treasure taking her on vacation or sending her on one so she can have a break from her mind. \n\nLook I am obsessed with my wife okay. And I know sometimes I can go overboard but it\u2019s a way of me expressing my love language. I send her flowers because she loves them, our wedding was wild flower themed. So last Sunday was our wedding Anniversary so yes I filled our house with wildflowers. Yes that seems dramatic but my wife loved it so I don\u2019t care. \n\nMy family came over and made us dinner to celebrate our Anniversary. It was a great time I enjoyed sharing this with my family. Until I stepped away to talk with my brother. I will say we had a few drinks and yes we know how to put it down we\u2019re Italian. We start having a civil conversation about our wives. It was fine until my brother said \u201cYou spoil your wife way to much my wife think it\u2019s to compensate for a bad marriage.\u201d \n\nOF course I was pissed, and on all days he had to say it on my anniversary. I snapped, I told him to F off and if his wife and him think like this they\u2019re no longer welcome in my home or around my wife. Him and his wife eventually left but not without a fight. My SIL shouted at my family saying \u201cI don\u2019t know we treat that outsider like family.\u201d My mother was pissed probably more than my wife. And her comment I don\u2019t know if it was racist(my wife is black) or classiest I\u2019m starting to think a mixture of both. \n\nBut anyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1689730603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153gz83/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_f_off_because_he/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, when you got married your wife is no longer an outsider, she's a part of the family. For SIL to talk like that makes it sound like she thinks marriage is supposed to stay in the family which frankly has me hearing banjos.", "Sounds like SIL is jealous and BIL is annoyed that your kind gestures make him look like a bum.

NTA.", "NTA, keep standing up for your wife and honestly it\u2019s your money and if seeing her happy from things you have given her makes you happy, then that\u2019s the end of it.

Your money. Your wife. Your business.", "NTA. \n\nBro and SIL are projecting because their marriage sucks, I bet plus they are probably being racist. I would honestly stay away from them from now on, grey rock them and go LC.", "NTA. why do people think it's ok discussing third part relationships like that? It's not even their money to begin with", "Your sister in law is just jealous because she doesn't get treated like your wife does.

Keep doing what you\u2019re doing and you will have a happy and successful marriage.", "NTA \u201cI don\u2019t know why we treat this outsider like family\u201d unless your SIL is from Alabama she\u2019s also an \u201coutsider\u201d who\u2019s married in. \n\nBe petty OP and treat your wife to a nice apology gesture. She deserves it (even though you did nothing wrong it\u2019s good to assure her that their comments don\u2019t reflect your beliefs or get into her head that she doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated) and what better way to get back at them then to pamper her a bit.", "Nta, you sound like a good husband!", "NTA you man up and stepped up for your wife.

Sil is jealous her husband doesn\u2019t do what you do and complains to him which in turn pisses off your brother.", "Bro is annoyed because his wife notices what you do and bro doesn't do much.  So sil is nagging him to do better.  So his solution is to blame you for being a loving caring husband.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, it seems like SIL is jealous they can't afford the things you can and how you're able to spoil your wife.
