Recently, he has been lazy. He hasn\u2019t been going to his job. He said it\u2019s because he keeps getting bad migraines. I told him he needs to see the doctor, but he doesn\u2019t want to. I told him if he isn\u2019t going to see the doctor, then he needs to take his ass to work. He told me he can\u2019t work because of the migraines. So he doesn\u2019t want to see a doctor or try to work. He just wants to keep sitting at home. This makes me mad because he\u2019s not doing anything. I told him he needs to see a doctor very soon and start working or I\u2019m going to assume that he\u2019s lying to me so he can be lazy and stay at home, and I will kick him out! 3 days went by and still hasn\u2019t seen the doctor or went to work, so I kicked him out. I let him eat breakfast first. My son told his dad what had happened (his dad lives in another state) and his dad thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\nI believe he was lying about the migraines so he doesn\u2019t have to work and that\u2019s why he was kicked out. He refused to pick up the phone and make an appointment, and he didn\u2019t seem like he was in a lot of pain. He also didn\u2019t tell me that he needs help or that he couldn\u2019t make the appointment. He does have health insurance too. I think he refused to make the appointment because he lied about the migraine.\n\nIf the pain is that damn bad, then why aren\u2019t you going to the doctors when you have insurance?", "created_utc": 1669825734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8vv6t/aita_for_kicking_out_my_son/", "score": 337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have no clue what's been going on and you're taking the word of a lazy teenager who wants to lay around. He doesn't go to the doctor because he doesn't have a problem. A negative diagnosis would just work against him. So, he refuses to address the issue he claims he has... it's on him. You are welcome to let him be lazy at your place.", "YTA and it sounds like your son may have depression.", "YTA. Migraines run in my family - they can be excruciating. My then-teen daughter had one that lasted 2 weeks. We took her to 3 doctors in that time. The family physician suggested high doses of Tylenol or the ER. The specialist suggested the ER for this kind of in-process full-blown attack (would cost us over $1k and require sitting in a bright noisy room for hours to get help) and had suggestions for keeping things under control \u201cnext time\u201d but no other fixes. The Asian medical specialist offered acupressure and had a soothing office environment - that didn\u2019t fix it fully but provided more relief than Western medicine had. There\u2019s a reason why your son might be reluctant to see a doctor and not believe it would even help much. \n\nBut even if he IS lazy - you kicking him out with 3 days notice is terrible parenting. At a minimum you could have made arrangements for him to move in with dad. You should have helped him save up for and find an apartment, or look into college/career training. Early adulting is very hard. Parenting through that is also tough but in order for your kid to be successful they need support through that stage. What exactly were you expecting him to do with a headache and just breakfast? Sleep on the streets or a park bench? You are so very much YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t expect your kid to help take care of you when you are old and can\u2019t work and difficult to deal with. You\u2019ve definitely made it clear that family doesn\u2019t mean someone you can count on.\n\nLook, I know that with 19-year-olds everything they do makes you frustrated. I think it\u2019s an evolutionary response - they need to move out and find their own watering hole, but that\u2019s scary, so parents and kids seem to drive each other crazy. I suspect there are pheromones involved. But if you want them to thrive in life you need to take a big breath and dig deep for the patience you built when they were babies. Give them love and support and encouragement, and don\u2019t just scold them.", "YTA I know what it's like to have migraines so bad that I can't even get out of bed or talk because they were so painful. Come to find out 2 weeks later it was a tumor in my brain. And seriously 3 days is not enough if you were sooooo worried about him who didn't you take him to the doctor yourself?? Hell why not make an appointment for him ? I think you were too rash in kicking him out.", "If he is in the US, going to the doctor may not be a luxury he thinks he can afford. Is he covered with your health insurance?", "YTA", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nHe's 19, and as he's technically an adult, he's still a teenager and you're still his parent. Why couldn't you make an appointment for him to help him out? Migraines are debilitating, sometimes when I have one I have to lay in a dark room with my eyes covered as even dim light hurts too much. Forget having the mental capacity to make a phone call and go through making an appointment. \r  \n\r  \nAlso, three days?? That's no time at all to make arrangements to find somewhere else to live. It sounds like you're sick of being a mom and wanted him out, so that's what you did.", "I'm ready for the downvotes here, but OP, you are definitely TA. \n\nAs someone who suffers from debilitating migraines, it SUCKS. I am exhausted, nauseous and want to sit in a dark room and not do anything or go anywhere. I certainly missed more than a few days from work because of it. When you are young and otherwise healthy it is SO hard to get a provider to listen to you and not tell you it's all in your head. My own mother gaslighted me through my own experience with migraines and I resented her so much for it. She didn't make me move out over them though. That is a different kind of low. \n\nYou are his mother and instead of being caring and compassionate you kicked him out after only 3 days. Now your son will always and forever remember the fact that when he was going through something difficult, your response was make him leave. You can be sure that anytime he faces something difficult in the future, he will never think that you are someone he can depend on.\n\nEdited to add: Just saw OP's comment, \"Going NC is fine with me. Sorry not sorry.\" Sounds like this isn't really about your son's wellbeing or ability to work. It sounds more like you were just looking for a reason to get him out of your house. Especially since you're okay with never speaking to him again. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.", "Oh my gosh you've been so generous! He's 19 and you still allow him to live at home?!? 3 whole days of being lazy before you kicked him out for not working and you even let him eat breakfast first! /s.  \n\nYTA.  I could understand if you said he had a habit of goofing off and was fired from multiple jobs for calling out or was relying only on you for everything including rides to everywhere except work. Nowhere do you state  how he's being 'lazy'.  Kid has a job and bought his own car. Lazy kids don't usually get to that point then nope out. Hes been off work for 3 days. Ever think that migraines are draining in some horrible ways especially when you've never had them before?  Maybe he's truly scared of what he might find out because he knows if its bad his dad is elsewhere and mom is proving she isn't as supportive as one would hope.

It sounds like you were already bitter about it. Are you having trouble affording supporting him, or do you want the place to yourself for some other reason and you're using this as an excuse? It's strange to me that you don't show any concern or care for him at all. \n\nIf he's actively suffering from bad migraines to the point where he can't work, have you considered that he might also be too sick to look up doctors, figure out insurance, make an appointment, etc? Especially at 19 which is an age where you're just starting to do that sort of thing for yourself for the first time, it can feel a bit overwhelming. Did you even try asking if he wanted your help? It's only been 3 days! Not to mention the fact that *many* doctors have waiting lists and book way out in time. I fail to see where the \"laziness\" here is, jobs have sick days and responsible adults call in sick to work when they're sick. \n\nI'd also like to suggest that if you think 3 days of debilitating migraines is a kicking-out worthy level of \"laziness\", then he probably hasn't actually been lazy before at all. If he's in such pain that he's uncharacteristically staying home from work, shouldn't you be worried about him?\n\nI'd have a different judgment if this were more long term, but it's only been a matter of *days*.", "YTA - he\u2019s right!
