Emma has been dating this guy, who I'll call \"Mark\", for a few months now and I've always been supportive of their relationship.\n\nHowever, things changed when I started noticing that Mark was always over at our apartment and he was starting to become a little too comfortable. He would eat our food, use our things without asking, and he would even stay over when Emma wasn't there. It got to the point that he would get drunk and slyly flirt/say sexual things to me while she was gone.\n\nOne day, I decided to confront Emma about it and I told her that I didn't feel comfortable with Mark always being over, being creepy and using our things without asking. Emma got really defensive and said that I was overreacting, and that Mark was just being friendly.\n\nI didn't want to cause any drama, so I dropped the subject. However, the situation only got worse and Mark started to become more and more invasive. Finally, I decided to confront Emma again and this time I told her that I thought Mark was taking advantage of us and that he needed to respect our boundaries.\n\nEmma got really angry and accused me of being jealous of their relationship. She said that I was being a terrible friend and that I should just mind my own business.\n\nNow I'm starting to wonder if I was the asshole for confronting Emma about her boyfriend.

Your friend is trying to protect their love interest and your giving them a reality check. If it were just about food and space I'd say just have a chat with them.

My roommate brought a guy home from work one night then he literally never left; just no called no showed to work and mooched off us for the rest of our time there. Dude ate my food, used (and lost) my electronics, and I'm pretty sure abused my cat. Wake up calls didn't work, telling my roommate exact words of what her bf said didn't work, nothing worked. Her bf was emotionally abusive and I suspect physically as well considering the amount of holes I ended up patching in the apartment. I ended up basically moving out but still having to pay rent until the lease could be broken.\n\nI hope for your sake, your roomier wakes the heck up and realizes that you have the right to be comfortable in your own home, but understand that your first responsibility is to yourself. Get a lock for your door and a fridge lockbox that only you have a key for. Plan an exit for if things get worse, including saving up money if possible to break and find a new lease.

She probably knows he's a creep, but doesn't want to admit it to herself. Him invading your shared space without permission is 100% your buisness. You weren't out of line.

I had to bring it to a higher level because I was afraid of being harassed in my own home.  You do not have to tolerate this. Speak to your RA if you have one, speak to someone at housing/your apartment complex. Try to get some resolution stuff going with your roommate and ensure she is ok. In my situation, the guy was abusive. At the very least, he sounds like he would cheat. You and your roommate are both at risk.", "NTA\n\nI mean if I were you and he was hot I\u2019d see if the gf roomie was really as cool as she claimed", "Info:\n\nAre you more upset about the creepy comments or just him being in your space and eating your food?", "Is he paying rent? But regardless he sounds like the ah.", "NTA But.....\n\nEmma knows Mark better than you, so Mark could be genuinely harmless with his comments, and if your only common denominator is Emma, it could be simple miscommunication that could be the problem.\n\nExample: Emma tells Mark it's cool for him to Kick it till she gets home, you're not cool with it..just communicate that you're nit cool with it, say hey if bro is going to eat our food tell him to buy some too, that's reasonable.\n\nI think the problem is it can be looked at from the perspective that you're using the creep factor as justification for your other grievances.\n\nIt's very hard to tell somebody that the person they love is a creep with out hard evidence. Like some people perso aliases are naturally flirtatious so there's also that.\n\nI'm not invalidating any of your concerns. I'm just saying taking time to understand people and situations leads to easy resolutions. Try talking to both of them at the same time instead of \"confronting\" Emma alone..it may make her defensive if you sit down with them both, in a friendly setting (drinks, food ect) and say like \"Hey Mark I'm glad you and Emma are happy, and since you're spending more time here maybe you can start grabbing some food you like for the fridge\" type shit feel me?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are unsafe with mark and from my understanding, he's not paying rent and should never be allowed there when Emma isn't there because he has no purpose or right to be there at all, especially with him being a fucking creep. Never be alone with this guy and make it clear to Emma that you feel unsafe due to his behavior and since she is too young and stupid/blinded by obsession you need very firm boundaries up with her as well and looking for a new place to live. She will absolutely blame you WHEN mark gets violent with you, you need to do something to make sure you are safe in your own home. \n\nI think you also need to tell actual friends who care about your well being or family, or even your housing manager. Emma is likely violating the lease if she's allowing an extra unwanted tenant to stay as often as mark is, especially if he has a key or is there regularly without tenant supervision. If she is going to continue to be unreasonable and put you in harms way then absolutely report her and mark to your landlord/property management and see if there's anything they could do to help get you somewhere safe.

Fuck Emma's feelings and her desperate need to be in a relationship. That's not worth your well being. \nIf he's being pushy, weird, sexually inappropriate, and invasive, I'd put a separate lock on my bedroom if there wasn't already one, maybe even a second padlock and arm myself (pocket knife, pepper spray, roll of quarters in a sock, I don't care but if he comes at you make sure you're at least not the only one getting assaulted).", "Nta.

At this point he realised he can fuck with you in increasing amounts, all he has to do is make it a little more intense, wait for you to confront roommate, roommate sides with him pushing the line of what he can do to you further, rinse repeat.\n\n\nYou are in a bad situation that will only get worse you need to find a way to stop this", "Some college apartments are owned by the university; if that is the case with yours, talk to the housing people or dean of students. If the building is not school owned, try talking to the landlord about breaking your part of the lease. You are not safe there.\n\nETA- NTA", "You should tell your roommate you don't want him over when she's not there. He's not on the lease and he makes you uncomfortable. You might even be able to trespass him. You are entitled to feel safe and comfortable in your home. NTA", "Ask your college for help. Raise the flag if the RA gives a weak response. Go to the chancellor. Whatever it takes. Make the school the bad guy kicking Mark out. He is violating the terms of your dorm lease. You can also ask-demand to move rooms. Please take care of yourself. your roommate is young and stupid but please, please put yourself first. If he assaults you, you have to deal with it for the rest of your life. Choose YOU.", "Emma sounds like a horrible roommate, and I've seen this happen before and not end well. She needs to tell Mark to not come over if she isn't there and she needs to respect your boundaries. Sorry you are going through this OP and maybe confront her again and just say you aren't comfortable with him there without her, and it may go better if a 3rd party is there with you (another friend or family member that you trust) when you do. NTA by far", "THIS!\n\nI can't believe I had to scroll down this far before finding this because that was immediately my thought. OP is most definitely NTA, and I have a feeling \"Mark\" is active on Reddit, found OP's profile, and is the typical asshole that thinks just because she makes that type of content, she'll have sex with him.", "Precisely", "Why does it matter if he\u2019s seen them or not? Doesn't excuse his creepy behaviour.", "\u201cNot all rats in the 1600s\u201d and yet would ya look at the numbers \ud83e\udd14", "That Mark it's more than an asshole, I hope OP can move out of the house or something \ud83d\ude2d him being drunk and with just her can be so dangerous", "That's unfortunate. The nerve of that person. Ugh \ud83e\udd2c", "I mean if you can't differ between me frequenting a \"Country-Subreddit\" and a guy hitting on his GF's roomate multiple times while being drunk and unwelcome, I don't think I can make you change your mind.\n\n  \nBut I feel like this is more you just lashing out because you already ran out of points to make and you actually know that nobody is fooled by that kind of argument.\n\n  \nTBH I'm not sure if you just can't let it go or if you actually feel personally attacked by the whole topic..just in case:  \nDeep inside, humans always believe themselfs to be better and more capable and safe than others, so they do borderline stuff and tell themselfs \n\n\"Oh, I know my boundaries and how to avoid becoming as bad as those who lost control, I'm way to oppossed to that behavior to ever do something like that\" \n\nand then comes an extreme situation they didn't plan for or even expect, maybe they are even intoxicated, so no inhibition....  \nGoes not only for rape....but for cheating, for physical fights, drunk driving, gun safety, embezzeling money (/gold), even being complicit by being willfully ignorant and so, so many other things you would never think you could ever do.  \n\n\nIf you ever felt you came close to doing something that crosses a certain  line, then yes, you should be wary about yourself and that line, because if you willfully ignore it and peoples reactions to you getting close to it, you running straight for a fuckup because you think you know better.\n\nAnd MAYBE this number will let you understand why even one wrong word after being told \"No\" is to much:\n\n81%\n\nThat's how many women have experiences of being sexually assaulted in their lifetime.\n\nAnd it's people who close their eyes to the harsh reality of \"You are what you do\" that -if not culprit themselfs- at least eenable and empower others to do so by making excuses and playing down the relevance of actions.", "Thanks for taking your licks and and not dismissing it. I totally understand the response. Cheers!", "Lol. Sure. Whatever you say."]}
