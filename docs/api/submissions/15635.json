Emma has been dating this guy, who I'll call \"Mark\", for a few months now and I've always been supportive of their relationship.\n\nHowever, things changed when I started noticing that Mark was always over at our apartment and he was starting to become a little too comfortable. He would eat our food, use our things without asking, and he would even stay over when Emma wasn't there. It got to the point that he would get drunk and slyly flirt/say sexual things to me while she was gone.\n\nOne day, I decided to confront Emma about it and I told her that I didn't feel comfortable with Mark always being over, being creepy and using our things without asking. Emma got really defensive and said that I was overreacting, and that Mark was just being friendly.\n\nI didn't want to cause any drama, so I dropped the subject. However, the situation only got worse and Mark started to become more and more invasive. Finally, I decided to confront Emma again and this time I told her that I thought Mark was taking advantage of us and that he needed to respect our boundaries.\n\nEmma got really angry and accused me of being jealous of their relationship.

Your friend is trying to protect their love interest and your giving them a reality check. If it were just about food and space I'd say just have a chat with them.

My roommate brought a guy home from work one night then he literally never left; just no called no showed to work and mooched off us for the rest of our time there. Dude ate my food, used (and lost) my electronics, and I'm pretty sure abused my cat. Wake up calls didn't work, telling my roommate exact words of what her bf said didn't work, nothing worked. Her bf was emotionally abusive and I suspect physically as well considering the amount of holes I ended up patching in the apartment. I ended up basically moving out but still having to pay rent until the lease could be broken.\n\nI hope for your sake, your roomier wakes the heck up and realizes that you have the right to be comfortable in your own home, but understand that your first responsibility is to yourself. Get a lock for your door and a fridge lockbox that only you have a key for. Plan an exit for if things get worse, including saving up money if possible to break and find a new lease.

She probably knows he's a creep, but doesn't want to admit it to herself. Him invading your shared space without permission is 100% your buisness. You weren't out of line.

Emma can go and live with her BF if she wants his company so often.", "NTA, I was in a similar circumstance last year. Roommate's bf was equally as creepy and rude. It was awful. I had to bring it to a higher level because I was afraid of being harassed in my own home.  You do not have to tolerate this. Speak to your RA if you have one, speak to someone at housing/your apartment complex. Try to get some resolution stuff going with your roommate and ensure she is ok. In my situation, the guy was abusive. At the very least, he sounds like he would cheat. You and your roommate are both at risk.", "NTA\n\nI mean if I were you and he was hot I\u2019d see if the gf roomie was really as cool as she claimed", "Info:\n\nAre you more upset about the creepy comments or just him being in your space and eating your food?", "Is he paying rent? But regardless he sounds like the ah.", "NTA But.....\n\nEmma knows Mark better than you, so Mark could be genuinely harmless with his comments, and if your only common denominator is Emma, it could be simple miscommunication that could be the problem.\n\nExample: Emma tells Mark it's cool for him to Kick it till she gets home, you're not cool with it..just communicate that you're nit cool with it, say hey if bro is going to eat our food tell him to buy some too, that's reasonable.\n\nI think the problem is it can be looked at from the perspective that you're using the creep factor as justification for your other grievances.\n\nIt's very hard to tell somebody that the person they love is a creep with out hard evidence. Like some people perso aliases are naturally flirtatious so there's also that.\n\nI'm not invalidating any of your concerns. I'm just saying taking time to understand people and situations leads to easy resolutions. Try talking to both of them at the same time instead of \"confronting\" Emma alone..it may make her defensive if you sit down with them both, in a friendly setting (drinks, food ect) and say like \"Hey Mark I'm glad you and Emma are happy, and since you're spending more time here maybe you can start grabbing some food you like for the fridge\" type shit feel me?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are unsafe with mark and from my understanding, he's not paying rent and should never be allowed there when Emma isn't there because he has no purpose or right to be there at all, especially with him being a fucking creep. Never be alone with this guy and make it clear to Emma that you feel unsafe due to his behavior and since she is too young and stupid/blinded by obsession you need very firm boundaries up with her as well and looking for a new place to live. She will absolutely blame you WHEN mark gets violent with you, you need to do something to make sure you are safe in your own home. \n\nI think you also need to tell actual friends who care about your well being or family, or even your housing manager. Emma is likely violating the lease if she's allowing an extra unwanted tenant to stay as often as mark is, especially if he has a key or is there regularly without tenant supervision. If she is going to continue to be unreasonable and put you in harms way then absolutely report her and mark to your landlord/property management and see if there's anything they could do to help get you somewhere safe.
