Sometimes that is the only way to make a person believe us", "NTA.  You have every right to say Mark can\u2019t be there if she isn\u2019t there.", "WARNING: Mark is going to get worse with you. It's not going to get better, and it sounds like your roommate will backup whatever Mark says.\n\nYou aren't safe with Mark there, and when he sexually assaults you, he'll have Emma back him up and say he isn't like that, and that you were jealous.\n\nIf he won't respect your boundraies, then you need to bring in help: friends, relatives, anybody into your room to reestablish some boundaries and forcefully get Mark to back off and ideally not be there when Emma isn't. If you're in a dorm, tell your RA about this and get their help/advice.\n\nTell others what's going on, take this seriously. Get help. It's going to get worse.\n\nEdit to add the obvious: NTA", "He's not violating \"our\" boundaries. Only yours.\n\nNTA.\n\nTime to record Mark and put the creep on blast. Not to everyone. Just your roommate.", "NTA - it's your business when it's happening in your space, especially if he's eating your food and making you directly uncomfortable.", "NTA - this is your home and you deserve to feel comfortable and safe in it. You are paying for your share of the house; Mark is not. If she cannot respect your desire to be safe and comfortable in your own home it may be time to look for a new roommate.", "NTA\n\nNo one has the right to make you feel uncomfortable, or taken advantage of in your own home. \n\nHonestly I'd be telling my roommate that I expect to be compensated for anything of mine that he used, and that since he is not on the lease, and paying a portion of all costs, he is absolutely not allowed to be there for any reason unless she is present.", "NTA. Your friend is trying to protect their love interest and your giving them a reality check. If it were just about food and space I'd say just have a chat with them. But since Mark is creeping on you, I skip that and say go for recording him being flirty and show that to Emma. She'll be heartbroken (maybe?) But at least you two remain friends", "NTA, you have to set limits with people, he\u2019s violating your privacy and taking what isn\u2019t his in eating your food etc., I\u2019d be looking for a new roommate and report the issue to your schools housing committee assuming you live on campus", "NTA. \n\nGod, I was in a similar boat in my early 20s. My roommate brought a guy home from work one night then he literally never left; just no called no showed to work and mooched off us for the rest of our time there. Dude ate my food, used (and lost) my electronics, and I'm pretty sure abused my cat. Wake up calls didn't work, telling my roommate exact words of what her bf said didn't work, nothing worked. Her bf was emotionally abusive and I suspect physically as well considering the amount of holes I ended up patching in the apartment. I ended up basically moving out but still having to pay rent until the lease could be broken.\n\nI hope for your sake, your roomier wakes the heck up and realizes that you have the right to be comfortable in your own home, but understand that your first responsibility is to yourself. Get a lock for your door and a fridge lockbox that only you have a key for. Plan an exit for if things get worse, including saving up money if possible to break and find a new lease. I know it's a lot, but it's what i wish I had done sooner.", "NTA. This is a very common roommate problem and it\u2019s frustrating that the person with the partner never wants to see it as a problem. There is no reason for him to be eating your food or being there when she is not.", "NTA, it\u2019s one thing if he is there with Emma and spending time with her. But for him to be there without her and to be doing those things is odd. You have more restraint than me. I would have asked her about it when he first stayed the night there without her.", "Nta. She probably knows he's a creep, but doesn't want to admit it to herself. Him invading your shared space without permission is 100% your buisness. You weren't out of line. Next time he's a creep, record him in the act. If she still won't listen, show her the recording, hopefully it'll get her to listen.", "NTA. Yoh did not overstep. They are walking all over you. You live there he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019d just set some boundaries. No guests (for both of you) without you there. Label food. Or move.", "NTA, you deserve respect in your home. Ensure she knows he has been flirting with you. Line up help to escort him out if he refuses to leave next time you ask.", "NTA\n\n\"Mark\" is a weirdo and it is 100% your right to not be ok with how he is acting.", "NTA. You have every right to stand up for yourself and do not deserve to be sexually harassed in your own home. \n\nTell Emma that, and that he needs to start paying rent and for your food that he is eating.Are you even allowed to have him stay over per your lease? Check it and see. If not, that\u2019s your \u201clegal ground\u201d for getting him out. Keep in mind she may go, too.", "nta. It IS YOUR business, it's YOUR apartment. You have a right to feel comfortable there. Emma is the one being a terrible friend and taking advantage of you. I'm surprised you didn't put your foot down earlier and look for a new place to live.", "NTA He should never be there when the roommate is not. You should both be able to agree with that. Then never be around him alone. If roommate gets up to go pee, then you go get something from your room. After a month then ask her for x number of no boyfriend days/nights. It's just easier to relax without \"company\". Goodluck.", "NTA - record him ; play it back to her. Keep your stuff in your room. How often does he stay over? Find out if that affects your lease.", "Whether or not he's being creepy or you are jealous of her relationship, you both pay the rent and are equal tenants. So if one person is uncomfortable with a guest the guest has to go. \n\nYou have the first right to feel safe and comfortable in the place you rent. Emma can go and live with her BF if she wants his company so often.", "NTA, I was in a similar circumstance last year. Roommate's bf was equally as creepy and rude. It was awful. I had to bring it to a higher level because I was afraid of being harassed in my own home.  You do not have to tolerate this. Speak to your RA if you have one, speak to someone at housing/your apartment complex. Try to get some resolution stuff going with your roommate and ensure she is ok. In my situation, the guy was abusive. At the very least, he sounds like he would cheat. You and your roommate are both at risk.", "NTA\n\nI mean if I were you and he was hot I\u2019d see if the gf roomie was really as cool as she claimed", "Info:\n\nAre you more upset about the creepy comments or just him being in your space and eating your food?", "Is he paying rent? But regardless he sounds like the ah.", "NTA But.....\n\nEmma knows Mark better than you, so Mark could be genuinely harmless with his comments, and if your only common denominator is Emma, it could be simple miscommunication that could be the problem.\n\nExample: Emma tells Mark it's cool for him to Kick it till she gets home, you're not cool with it..just communicate that you're nit cool with it, say hey if bro is going to eat our food tell him to buy some too, that's reasonable.\n\nI think the problem is it can be looked at from the perspective that you're using the creep factor as justification for your other grievances.\n\nIt's very hard to tell somebody that the person they love is a creep with out hard evidence. Like some people perso aliases are naturally flirtatious so there's also that.\n\nI'm not invalidating any of your concerns. I'm just saying taking time to understand people and situations leads to easy resolutions. Try talking to both of them at the same time instead of \"confronting\" Emma alone..it may make her defensive if you sit down with them both, in a friendly setting (drinks, food ect) and say like \"Hey Mark I'm glad you and Emma are happy, and since you're spending more time here maybe you can start grabbing some food you like for the fridge\" type shit feel me?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
