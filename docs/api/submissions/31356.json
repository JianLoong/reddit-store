It is a real shame that you will now have to work the entire long weekend and get paid double time.", "NTA. They didn't even bother to check with you way in advance. Or even before he got the tickets! They are the AHs here so good on you for not going.", "NTA. This is bullshit. I have had to wade through a bit with my family this year, but not like this. I love that you are staying home. Order pizza or Cho Rae food. Sleep. Don\u2019t worry about them.", "NTA", "NTA. You should have been asked if you could do it, not voluntold. And with you work schedule and all that driving it puts you at a higher risk for an accident on one of the highest traffic times of the year", "NTA. If your uncle's plan was for you to drive 2 hours out of your way to get him, he needed to **ask your permission** *before* buying a ticket into that airport. It's his fault that he now has to rent a car. \n\nEveryone trying to tell you what to do, making plans without your consent, and guilting you for not being able to make it are AHs.", "Poor planning on their part doesn't constitute an emergency on your part. If they wanted anything from you, they should have communicated in a timely manner and made contingency plans in the event your work schedule changed and made it impossible for you to come. They don't have to like it but they better figure out a way to get over it cause they caused the problem not you. NTA.", "NTA 1000 times.\n\nYour mom and grandma volunteered YOU to pick up your uncle for Thanksgiving.  Never mind that you have a job and a six hour commute.  Nobody ASKED you to do this - you were \"voluntold.\"\n\nIf it were me, I would make SURE I worked on Friday, and would skip Thanksgiving altogether.  I've been \"voluntold\" a few too many times, and stuck doing things for others on holidays enough, so that I actually quit taking time off on the Friday after Thanksgiving on purpose.  My in-laws either expected me to cook for everybody on both Thursday and Friday, or get in a car to drive 350 miles one way to see extended family.  All while working a job with long hours.", "NTA. Let his son drive him the full way. What's the difference. Oh, you probably are the responsible one and everyone expects you to always accommodate everyone else.\n\nNot this time as it is not your problem.", "NTA, I wouldn't put up with that either.  Choosing an airport that is practically a whole state away and then getting pissed for someone they didn't even ask for not picking them up.  It sounds like his son now has a trip to make Wed morning so they can be at the airport at 3 to drive their dad back.", "NTA. Your right. Not your problem. Your uncle shouldn't plan on going places he can't afford to go and then expect others to bail him out. This time, perhaps, he learn a lesson. Too bad everyone is trying to use you as his scapegoat. \n\nTell them all to suck eggs, you are not taxi service.  You will not be attending ANY family events from here on out until everyone understands that YOU ARE NOT THERE FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE.  You have a life that includes a job, responsibilities to the people work with, you have a home and responsibilities there, and you are not going be taken advantage of simply because someone else doesn't have the money, time, or ability to do things on their own or to plan ahead and save money.", "NTA.  Other people can\u2019t make your plans for your time.", "Maybe the family can chip in on the rental car.", "Right?! The airport when I visit my parents is a nearly two hour drive because they live in the middle of nowhere. I don't drive, so someone needs to pick me up. Logistics around that get figured out before the tickets are even purchased.", "I thi k he was never asked at all. He was voluntold", "Unfortunately, that's too much truth, and they'll never sit still for it.", "Yes, all of this! the wednesday before thanksgiving is like literally the worst day to fly into an airport in the US, I can't imagine what the traffic around the airport is like (I can't imagine it because I would never, not for any money experience it). Even if you don't pickup and just do the circle for arrivals (pro-tip, sometimes going up to departures is less traffic), on a regular day, it can be complete hell of creeping traffic, people pulling out randomly, stopping randomly, horns honking, cops blowing whistles...hell.", "I live 50 miles from the closest airport and it still can take 2 hours (or more) to get there. And then the leaving...let's not even start.", "Thankfully, the airport up there is a tiny domestic only one so the traffic/parking/etc is never bad. But I live in Toronto, so the airports at this end can be a nightmare \ud83e\udd23"]}
