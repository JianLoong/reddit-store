{"id": 11729, "submission_id": "11l9y5h", "title": "AITA for shocking my teenage son with a sanitary pad?", "selftext": "TA for obvious reasons.\n\nMe (43F) and my husband (45M) have a 15-year-old son I'll call Josh. Now Josh is a typical teenager, which I can handle. I understand that they leave socks and dirty dishes lying around, have to be reminded to put deodorant on, etc. What I find harder to deal with is the fact that, like any teenager, he seems to be...discovering the pleasures of \"alone time\", if you know what I mean. Let's say that if he had a Fitbit, it would show a hell of a lot more steps than is humanly possible between his three main hangouts: school, his room, and the fridge.\n\nAgain, I know it's normal and I have no problem with whatever he wants to do in the privacy of his own room. But here's the problem: I find evidence everywhere. Tissues in the bathroom, a sock in the laundry that I could use as a bookend, dirty underwear, etc.\n\nI talked to his dad about it, who said he'd talk to him and explain that while it's completely natural, he should make sure to clean up after himself. Things were okay for a while, but he's been slacking again over the last couple of weeks. The final straw came the day before yesterday when I emptied his jeans pockets before doing a load of laundry and basically stuck my hand in a pair of crusty underwear he had decided to hide in there.\n\nThis time I confronted him (because I was disgusted) and asked how he would feel if his dad and I left \"evidence\" of our romantic endeavors lying around. He went full teenager, mumbled and grumbled, rolled his eyes, then slammed the door en sulked in his room.\n\nNow, this is where I may be the asshole. My husband and son get up at the same time. My husband has breakfast while my son showers, and then my son has breakfast while my husband showers. Then my husband takes him to school and goes on to work. I work from home, so usually sleep a little longer. Before I went to bed, I pulled out a pair of my (clean) underwear, stuck a sanitary pad in it, and smeared some ketchup on it. Then I left it on the bathroom floor like I had just taken it off and left it for someone else to clean up.\n\nYesterday morning I got woken up by my angry husband, who had to deal with my son who was \"traumatized and gagging and what mother does that omg mom wtf I'm never using the bathroom again\". I told him that this is exactly how I feel when I have to clean up his bodily fluids and that this may help him realize how disgusting he's being. He was embarrassed and got dressed and went to school by himself. My husband says I shouldn't have shamed him like this because it will warp his views on sexuality and will grow up thinking it's bad. I told him it's not about sexuality, it's about respecting the people you live with. He says I should have let him talk to him again and that I went too far. My son hasn't spoken a word to me since yesterday morning.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678220066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l9y5h/aita_for_shocking_my_teenage_son_with_a_sanitary/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband sounds like a wet noodle though", "He\u2019s more than old enough to be doing his own laundry. I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "NTA, and beautifully played! \n\nI was given a hand towel or two, and expected to do my own laundry, which I was anyway.\n\nPS: tell hubby to pound sand. You gave him several opportunities to talk to him, and either he couldn't be asked, or he did a  poor job.", "Info - why not just\u2026 stop doing his laundry?", "NTA. And I also suggest your son is doing his laundry for himself from now on. He is old enough to do it.", "NTA.\n\nYour son's behavior is inappropriate. Heck, he could just do it in the shower and be fine. You tried the easy way of talking with him and asking him to stop (not an unreasonable request), he didn't, you escalated it from there. It wasn't even the real thing since you just used ketchup anyway. Hopefully he'll learn.", "NTA\n\nYou tried asking him nicely and he was refused to change his behavior. Your response was reasonable. How many times does your husband expect you to deal with your son being really inconsiderate. \n\nIt's not sex negative to point out that -- outside of very specific and consensual situations -- NOBODY wants their hands in contact with another person's sexual secretions.", "NTA, although \u201calone time\u201d is natural, especially at his age, the blatant laziness to clear up after himself is a problem. I think you taking this approach is probably in the long run a lot less awkward for both parties than having to have a full length discussion about you having to mop up his j*zz 14 times a week. I think if anything ignoring the issue could actually have been more problematic. It\u2019s \u2018alone\u2019 time for a reason, and maybe it\u2019s a little weird he wasn\u2019t more private about it in the first place? I\u2019d have died of embarrassment at 15 having my mum and dad complaining to me that I\u2019m leaving a trail of tissue behind me. Probably a good thing anyway because I can imagine it was quite uncomfortable for you, so it\u2019s good to set these privacy boundaries, especially with this kind of thing.", "NTA. Class move. Your husband is an AH though.", "NTA\n\nComedian Jo Koy has a great bit about his mom confronting him about his... activities.", "NTA! I LOVE the creativity. It wasn't even a real pad. I love this. I hope to rise to your level of petty in my journey through motherhood. I had my first one 3months ago. \n\n\nHe'll get over it. And maybe now he'll keep his little jizz-paper mache projects somewhere else. \n\n\nANNNND he would be doing his own laundry\n\n\n\nEdit: please tell your husband that the moral of this story wasn't that \"sexuality is shameful\" its that \"leaving crusty cum collections everywhere is shameful\"\n\n *imagine his college roommates teasing him about this. Id rather it be mommy*", "NTA", "NTA I'm mostly upset your husband isn't on your side on any of this. Maybe hubs needs to stick his fingers into the crispy socks a few times and man up and do some laundry.  \n\nEasy fix is that son from now on does his own laundry and if that means he wears jizz stained jeans for a week because he's too lazy to do laundry, OH WELL. \n\nAt some point this kid might have a girlfriend. How is he going to handle that?   I admit I'd be a little less certain of my NTA if it was an actual biohazard bodily fluid but ketchup? Yeah come on.  The men in your life, BOTH of them, need to stop being weak.", "Okay, NTA but your kid is old enough to do his own disgusting laundry.", "NTA. I knew a girl who literally did this with her sanitary products. \nShe stayed with my family for awhile (my brothers ex) and truly believed it was perfectly normal. \nIt\u2019s absolutely not and it\u2019s honestly concerning when people believe it is. \nYour son needs therapy. He\u2019s disclosing his sexual behaviors to his family non consensually. \nI\u2019d say you should begin refusing to clean his laundry. Any time you see his clothes or some of his trash just push it back into his room.", "I'm laughing so hard at this. Absolutely NTA, kid should've listened when you gave him the chance\nIt's not like you did anything crazy disgusting, thats a normal body function for half the population", "NTA - You tried a reasonable approach of talking to him first, it didnt work. Secondly, doubt hes traumatized...just likely embarrassed. No actual bodily fluids were used and lastly, the concept of periods are something he should get used to anyway if he ever wants to date a woman.\n\nEDIT : the only other thing I can suggest is just to stop cleaning after him. If he has no underwear to use because theyre all crusty then thats his problem.", "NTA.\n\nThis was a creative way to make your point. Discussion alone clearly wasn't working. He's not traumatized. He's being dramatic, as teens often are. And, hopefully, you won't have to deal with his ejaculate anymore.", "NTA. This was a brilliant method.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, but if your son is \u201ctraumatized\u201d by seeing a used pad, I really don\u2019t have high hopes for his future relationships (assuming he\u2019s straight). Like he knows that if he lives with a woman, he\u2019s going to have to see that every once in a while, right? And it\u2019s not even the same thing really, because he has a lot more control over where his mess ends up and what he does with it seeing as it\u2019s not just 24/7 blood leaking out of a body part for a whole week. \n\nIn terms of his issue with leaving his messes everywhere: I would stop doing his laundry or even touching his bedroom if I were you. I would also (using gloves, obviously) put any \u201cevidence\u201d I find that\u2019s not in the trash can into his bedroom (or better yet, make your husband do that since he doesn\u2019t seem to realize how annoying it is) and make it his responsibility to keep his bedroom clean. He\u2019s definitely old enough to do this stuff himself, and if he can\u2019t keep his mess to the appropriate places, let him be the one to deal with it.\n\nEDIT: also, like a couple of others have mentioned, it\u2019s weird that your husband sexualized the pad. It\u2019s really not sexual at all. You should probably talk to him about this and make sure he\u2019s not passing on any weird ideas to your son.", "Seems to me that the lesson may have hit home. NTA", "ESH.  God y'all are nasty.", "NTA. Giving him a taste of his own medicine, lol! NICE! Here's hoping he's learned something.", "I mean I can see why you went down that road but how about you just teach him to do his own washing? Don\u2019t go in his room and let him do it himself. If he doesn\u2019t and runs out of clothes he\u2019ll soon learn he needs to do it. I kinda torn so going for ESH", "Comedy gold!", "Nta and it sounds like dad has volunteered to do all of his sons laundry, since it's no big deal *he* can deal with it.", "I\u2019m truly shocked to see that everyone is saying your NTA. You shamed your son for natural changes happening to his body and there will be physiological consequences of that regardless of your intentions. Yes he should be more considerate of how he cleans up, but he is technically still considered a child while you are the adult in this situation. Instead of using shame and fear to parent maybe just have him start doing his own laundry?", "NTA !! Lol fair play to you!!! Fyi Why does it say TA for obvious reasons at the start ?? Surely incorrect??", "NTA. That's hilarious. But yeah, just show him how to do his own laundry from now on, and anything you're doing where you find evidence of masturbating now becomes his chore too. Your husband is concerning me. his response to his son being \"traumatized\" by proof of a period should be to dispell his concerns because periods aren't scary. Sit them both down with mama doctor Jones on you tube until they can say \"women get periods and that is normal\" without freaking out.", "NTA There should be nothing traumatising or shameful about bodily functions and hopefully he learned his lesson. Plus he might have to deal with a menstruating girlfriend at some point and not freaking out about things like that will earn him plus points.", "NTA. Not only is that a perfect response to what he\u2019s been doing, but also if he is \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the sight of period blood (which wasn\u2019t even real), he needs to grow up. It seems like you or your husband talked to him about it nicely before and gave him the chance to change, but he didn\u2019t. If he\u2019s willing to leave his bodily fluids all over for you to clean up, he can\u2019t be upset if you leave yours around too.", "He should do his own laundry.", "NTA and I think it is time for your son to learn how to work the washer and dryer!", "NTA.  A for effort and execution, and I like your sense of humor.", "YTA and you are disgustingly ridiculous. Where tf do you want him to put his crusty socks and jeans and underwear, if not in the laundry? If it offends you so much, make him do his own laundry. And tell your husband you need to get a little bit more action, cuz you're jealous of your son.", "NTA, and it sounds like it's time for your son to be doing his own laundry", "YTA. He's a child, you're a *supposed* adult. Request that he do his own laundry, or you and/or your husband should have an additional discussion with him.", "NTA and you\u2019re my new hero. You didn\u2019t leave an actual used pad. And he didn\u2019t touch it as you r had to do with his stuff. He\u2019s old enough to understand and needs to do better or you\u2019ll keep leaving lovely little surprises like this. Red koolaid in the toilet bowl and do every toilet just to make sure he has to deal with it. Make him go to the store and buy tampons. What you did is nowhere near as gross as what you\u2019re having to deal with.", "NTA - make him do his own laundry though. That will help more than illustration.", "NTA \n\n Dad tried.. it work for a bit before it didn't.\n\nMom does a fake pad. And it should stick now\n\n\nCould of been worse.. could of been a dye or red drink soked tampon in the sink", "These Y T A comments are so funny. You didn't even expose him to GENUINE BODY FLUIDS like he does you. He encountered a condiment. Boohoo. Much less traumatizing than sticking your hand in your child's jizz. NTA at all.", "YTA weaponizing periods won\u2019t help him at all. It reinforces the stigma of disgust towards menses. you sunk below his level. consequences are important, but there was a better way to handle this.", "His views on sexuality are already warped if he can\u2019t handle a bloody pad", "NTA lmaooooo \n\nBut also it\u2019s time for him to do his own laundry since he\u2019s such a big boy now", "NTA. You asked him nicely and told him firmly", "You're NTA, there is nothing shameful or disgusting about a period and actually for him to be gagging over an apparently used pad seems really OTT in the scheme of thjngs.  Get him a laundry basket and an airer and don't do anymore washing for him.", "NTA\n\nHe got the message. Husband's approach didn't stick...", "NTA, but also, that boy is too old not to be doing his own laundry. Don't make his first partner as an adult be the one to educate him on washing his clothes like I had to with my husband when he was 21 years old.", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty funny. It wasn\u2019t a used pad - it was ketchup. It also made a solid point. \n\nYour son isn\u2019t traumatized, but likely embarrassed because it was a bit of realization in it and he knows it.\n\nIt is weird to me your husband sexualized a menstrual pad though. It is not sexual. Had it been real, it is also a very real and natural biological function. Much like your son\u2019s activity. Just because it happens doesn\u2019t mean you leave it around everywhere for people to see and find.\n\nI would also tell him moving forward he will need to do his own laundry and empty his trash cans. I wouldn\u2019t be doing it for him if he cannot keep it contained.", "The kid was traumatized? Give me a break. \n\nNTA \n\nTho imo, he should be doing his own laundry. This would solve the issue imo AND better prepare him to not have you around.", "NTA\n\nYour son needs to do his own laundry", "Absolutely NTA. This is the funniest way to learn a lesson I've ever read. Honestly, your husband not being on your side disappointing- you grabbed crusty underwear unexpectedly (which, and I'm a man, wtf), and he thinks SEEING a sanitary pad is traumatic?", "Omg i love it! \ud83d\ude02 NTA, iti just like you said, about sanitary practices and respecting each other", "YTA and you know it\n\nYou didn't leave \"'evidence' of your romantic endeavors\", you left out a pad with \"blood\" on it. It's not even remotely the same and, as a woman, I am disgusted that you would do this\n\nDid you talk to him about appropriate places to \"enjoy\" himself? Tbh, the shower/bathroom is a normal place as well, so restricting him to his room alone seems a bit harsh, but I digress. He's using tissues (assume you found them in the bathroom bin), socks are kinda normal, and his underwear... girl, do you not have a snail trail yourself??\n\nI agree with you husband, you're shaming him for something completely natural. If you're tired \"cleaning\" it, then tell him it's time to do his own laundry. Stop shaming the poor boy", "LOL nta", "NTA and it's a little funny.

Now Josh is a typical teenager, which I can handle. I understand that they leave socks and dirty dishes lying around, have to be reminded to put deodorant on, etc. What I find harder to deal with is the fact that, like any teenager, he seems to be...discovering the pleasures of \"alone time\", if you know what I mean. Let's say that if he had a Fitbit, it would show a hell of a lot more steps than is humanly possible between his three main hangouts: school, his room, and the fridge.\n\nAgain, I know it's normal and I have no problem with whatever he wants to do in the privacy of his own room. But here's the problem: I find evidence everywhere. Tissues in the bathroom, a sock in the laundry that I could use as a bookend, dirty underwear, etc.\n\nI talked to his dad about it, who said he'd talk to him and explain that while it's completely natural, he should make sure to clean up after himself.

I will say you probably need to have a conversation with tour husband as it seems he is afraid of teaching hard lessons.\n\nEdit; I will add actually that you should have brought it up to your husband first.
