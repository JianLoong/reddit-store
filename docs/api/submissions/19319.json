Children are part of living in a society and of course you should be able to bring them with you to public spaces.

YTA. There are some places that aren\u2019t appropriate for small children. An expensive steak house is one of them.

Basically, you don't care if others have a bad time, as long as you have fun.

Not that I expect you to leave, but it put pressure on her to quiet the baby.\n\nTake kids to family restaurants. Leave them at home for high end and nicer places. If they offer a kids menu, I guess that sets the expectation kids are welcome, no matter the age. If they don't have a kids menu, please give it a miss with the kids.\n\nGuess what...

High end steak houses are not the venue for a young baby. Since you were getting a deal on the food you could have gotten a babysitter.\n\nThe one I feel for is the waiter who probably lost a good tip from the table of 8 adults. There probably will be staff meetings about getting rid of the deals.  There is always someone who ruins a good deal for the customer.

The vast majority of people that are going to be there will not have children with them and I tried to be courteous knowing a crying baby or fussing toddler would disturb everyone else. \n \nThey should have also been cognizant of the fact your wife did take the child out to calm him and not let him just scream the whole time.", "YTA it sounds like you let him whine and cry for awhile before your wife stepped out - I don't blame the other table for getting upset but they probably should have gotten the manager to speak to you. 5 months is way too young to bring to a high end restaurant", "Where did your son sit?", "YTA Nice restaurants are no place for kids too young to behave appropriately for the setting.", "YTA.

If it was a Saturday night at 7 pm, I\u2019d have a different answer but 11 am? That\u2019s fine. You took him out when he cried. Also, babies exist in the world. I don\u2019t go anywhere in the late morning expecting not to encounter children.", "So, in total maybe ten minutes of fussy baby and crying baby, which was handled quickly and appropriately... at an eleven am meal at a public restaurant?  \n\n\nNTA and shame on that person for trying to pick a fight with a little family trying to have a nice brunch out.", "Take your kid out as soon as he starts crying.

I know you and your wife did the best you could, but it doesn't change that your infant was an unexpected disturbance to others.\n\nThe people who did find your baby disturbing handled the situation poorly. If there was such an issue there for them, they should have spoken with their server or a manager rather than confronting you the way they did.", "YTA.

This is regardless of the time of day or meal specials.\n\nUnfortunately, if your child is too young to be able to be quiet for the duration of the meal, they\u2019re too young to be there.

It doesnt matter the time you went to this high end steak house with your 5 mouth old child. \nNobody,no matter the time wants to hear your child crying.

Either get a sitter or practice a \"out and about\" settling routine in more family friendly restaurants. Once kiddo is a bit older or less likely to fuss, then sure, take them with you to more \"adult\" venues."]}
