I was waiting until her kids got older (like into high school/college) before we married,so that they would be happy for her and I just thought they would prefer that instead of having to live with me.

My mom did this to me and my sisters. Before my mom and dads divorce was even final she was forcing another man into our lives. I had only spoke with him 3 times before she married him. When we called out reasons why we did not like him (talking down to my mom, cheating on my mom via instagram and Snapchat, making bare minimum effort to be part of our lives) she told us that we were being hateful and married him anyway. I was honestly scared of him because of how many narcissistic behaviors he exhibited similar to my ex-abusive dad. I feel that as a parent, you should always put your kids first. Or, at least care enough to respect their feelings and boundaries. I wish my moms bf (now husband) had made an effort like you to respect our boundaries, get to know us, and understand that we must still grieve our parents divorce. \n\nI think you\u2019re a great bf and father-figure for caring for the mom while taking things slow and being so understanding of the childrens\u2019 loss. I am so sorry that they have not received your efforts in a positive way yet. I know for certain it\u2019s harder for them to grieve a death than a divorce. I am not going to give you unsolicited advice on what you should try to say to the mom or kids  because I know every situation is vastly different and also I realize that\u2019s not what this subreddit is for. \n\nJust want bring these things up about my experience from child\u2019s POV so you can be assured you\u2019re 1000% NTA.", "NTA.

You were honest, there is nothing wrong with that. Question\u2026 if it wasn\u2019t the thing with the kids would you have said yes?

Sometimes it\u2019s silent treatment or sometimes anger. I lost my father at a young age and I didn\u2019t grieve until my late 20s. But all you can do is be there for them. However if you truly love your girlfriend you\u2019d accept her kids. It almost seems like you\u2019re not okay with her kids giving the excuse bc of how her kids treat you.", "Her youngest was only a couple months old and oldest was only 4 when he passed?

He said if we became a couple I wouldn\u2019t meet her for at least a year.  I said that was the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever said to me.  And we\u2019d had plenty of spicy glam up till then.

I get it, you love each other. Marriage is obviously an option\u2026 in the future. But you placed those kids first and I love that. Forcing them into seeing you as their new dad while they\u2019re processing grief is a terrible idea. If anything, I question her for putting her children\u2019s mental health on the back burner. Maybe reach out, try a calm conversation. Explain to her that you love her and do want to marry her, but you have to put the mental health of the kids first. Tell her that regardless, you are together and nothing will change that. But you still need to prioritize the kids. Hopefully they come around, it\u2019s just grief. If he passed of cancer this was likely a very traumatic and long ordeal for all of them. They just need time.", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think putting your marriage on hold should mean your putting the relationship on hold.

Honestly, I would just focus on making money to pay for their stuff. You can hire college girls to service you every so often. It makes more economical sense than considering marriage.", "Thank you so much, I appreciate your input on the situation.\n\nI definitely don't wanna rush things with these kids,its been 8-9 years since their father died,I can understand how they are not ready to accept another man role-model into their lives and I'm completely okay with that. I want them to come to me on their own terms,not by being forced to. That'll make them hate me and possibly start hating their mom for doing this to them.", "Sorry for the rant, I didn\u2019t mean to make it that long this just hit close to home is all.", "But this is not the same: their dad has been dead at least eight years \u2014 not right after, like with your mom\u2019s divorce.", "I think it's fake, the numbers don't match.

They will talk to me and will tell me about their day but they just basically consider me as like a \"uncle\".", "Exactly this. My bio dad left around this age, and I didn\u2019t even remember much of him to really be angry of my mom dating other people after, and from what little bits I remember or am told, I was a huge daddy\u2019s girl.

By the time I was 7/8 I didn\u2019t remember my bio dad because he wasn\u2019t around anymore. Small children grieve differently than older kids who retain their memories clearer. This whole story sounds fishy. Especially them \u201cdating\u201d for 3 years before even being bf & gf. You would think in those 3 long years they would have gotten used to him being around. Also says she\u2019s mad and staying in the guest room, which implies they are living together, which.. if you\u2019re already that far in, you\u2019ve pretty much already become their stepdad.", "Thank you.

She is not permanent living with me,she is only staying with me until her house if finished with the construction work that's been going on for a few months. I have considered a long engagement but as I said,I am trying to take these kids into consideration before I marry her right away.

I understand your point of view on the situation though. Thanks for your input.", "Yes,I would absolutely love to commit to this woman and I deeply love her and support her but it seems that she isn't considering her kids.

It's so strange that she wouldn't see that, it's actually baffling!\n\nIt seems extremely selfish on her part and I think this needs to be a red line for you to help her come to her senses. What would make someone act like that?

I don't want her to use that to guilt them into it though.", "In a comment OP said the second child was adopted after husband\u2019s death, so it would have no memory of the adoptive father.\n\nAnd still, it has been at least eight years. The kid never knew the dad. So  it\u2019s not the same as your mother finding a new partner right after the divorce. \n\nAlso, in another comment, OP has admitted he would have said no even if the kids weren\u2019t an issue.", "I think sometimes the adoption process starts before a child is chosen because the process can take a while, so that could be what she means? that they were in the process of adopting (not specifically any child)?", "No. Been seeing each other for 3 years before dating.", "I unfortunately think so as well.

The proposal was definitely a spur of the moment thing and I was not expecting it. As I said,I am ready to fully commit to this woman but it was the most random time she could've sprung a proposal on me. Needless the say,I was in a bit of shock.\n\nI was thinking so too, I don't wanna leave without giving her or her kids a chance but it could come to having to end the relationship.", "It really seems like the kids are only an excuse.\nBut it's okay If OP isn't ready, He just should be honest about it", "OK but then wouldn't the death of a main income earner rule them out?", "yet shes staying at your house still ?", "This may have been a reasonable consideration if their dad died a short while ago. It has been eight years (by your timeline). \n\nIf this really is what you want and it is what their mom wants, you should accept her proposal and marry her. If the kids don\u2019t like it, put them in therapy. It sounds like they need the help anyway.", "~~Agreeing with you both. OP states it's been 8-9 years since the death of their father but doesn't want to \"move too fast\". The way he's adamantly using this loss from nearly a decade ago almost seems disrespectful. He should just *leave* already.~~ Edit: Fake story.", "And how exactly would that child be mourning the death of someone who died years before they were born?", "Exactly"]}
