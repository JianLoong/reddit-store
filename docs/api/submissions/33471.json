I (40m) have a 16 yo daughter Lucy who has a friend Britt (16f). Britt has been friends with Lucy for years and has been to our house countless times. But recently she has been starting to act out in different ways. She used to be such a nice girl but these days she can be quite sarcastic and mean. \n\nWe recently got a new carpet in our house and my wife made a rule that no one can wear shoes in the house. Britt came over last week and as she was coming in I asked her to take off her shoes. She answered saying \u201cwhy do you have a foot fetish or something\u201d which I just thought was a really weird and inappropriate response (and also I don\u2019t\u2026 but even if I did what would that have to do with anything). I said no it\u2019s just that we get this new carpet and we don\u2019t want it to get dirty. I thought I heard her say your dad is so weird or something as they were going up the stairs.\n\nLater when they came down for some food Britt was wearing some bright pink socks that I assume were Lucy\u2019s as she wasn\u2019t wearing any socks when she went upstairs. They caught my eye and she saw me glance down at them and she said to Lucy \u201csee I knew I should cover them up\u201d which to be fair Lucy replied something like \u201coh shit up Britt stop being dramatic\u201d. Anyway I was feeling uncomfortable so I just said \u201cBritt please can you go home now\u201d she just laughed and said I\u2019m going soon anyway and I said no I want you to leave now please. She got her stuff and left. \n\nAfter that Lucy was mad with me. She said that Britt was only joking and I completely over reacted. My wife also said that she didn\u2019t agree with the way I handled it. It all just felt really off to me though. I don\u2019t know if I should just laugh it off or not.", "created_utc": 1703138893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ng31m/aita_for_asking_my_daughters_friend_to_leave_my/", "score": 4178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not a problem that your wife and daughter have to face, so you are the only one who can advocate for yourself by asserting the seriousness of the issue. \n\nOne comment was weird, but for her openly imply that you are sexually interested in her feet right in front of you is beyond disrespectful -- it could ruin your reputation if it became an unchecked running \"joke\" and others caught wind of it and thought there's no smoke without fire.\n\nYou're just \"overreacting\" until a bunch of other people think you're a skeevy guy who creeps on teens. Being accused of being sexually interested in a minor is not something to shrug off as nothing. You had to address it in some way. If I were you I wouldn't even want her in the house after this. She might not realize the full seriousness of what she's implying, and what it could do to your reputation, but you do.", "NTA\n\nI know some comments are saying you handled this poorly despite giving a NTA verdict, but I think you were just awkward for very valid reasons. At that time, there was no point in engaging with Britt, and i suspect it would have been counterproductive given how rude and sarcastic she had already been. So, if you can\u2019t engage in a conversation or even justify yourself, the best course of action was to avoid any interaction at all. And since it was your house, and she had been disrespectful, asking her to leave was a very valid response that de-escalated the tension immediately without causing any hurt to you or the two teenagers.\n\nI think you do need to have a conversation with Lucy about what happened. Firstly, to ensure she understands why Britt was wrong, inappropriate, and disrespectful, so that Lucy doesn\u2019t start sympathising with Britt and doesnt start emulating such behaviour. Secondly, I\u2019m sure she felt awkward herself when her friend and father were involved in such a weird conflict. So you need to understand where she is coming from, validate her feelings, and try to explain why you had to de-escalate that issue to safeguard yourself from a teenager who seemed to be throwing around serious accusations without any evidence or care for consequences for the people involved (herself, Lucy, and you).", "NTA. She was insinuating you had a foot fetish and were getting off on her feet. What an uncomfortable thing for a teenager to say to their friend\u2019s parent. I guarantee this AH teenager is now going to tell all your daughter\u2019s friends that you\u2019re a creepo. \n\nYou did the right thing by making her leave. Don\u2019t ever let her in your house again. This is the same kind of teenager that will cry wolf and say you touched her inappropriately. \n\nAlso- even take the feet context out of it and she was flat out rude and disrespectful. You asked her to leave and she copped a bit of an attitude. Nope- get out and never return.", "I have a knot in my stomach on your behalf just imagining this situation. Gross. I\u2019m so sorry that happened. Teens are weird. It sucks all around but I\u2019m glad you set that boundary.", "NTA. The comments she made (\"foot fetish\") were way out of line. It's totally reasonable to ask to her to leave following that.", "Not the asshole. You asked her to leave politely after she made inappropriate comments to you in your own home. It would be mean if you forbid her from coming over again, but the comments were uncomfortable to you. Don\u2019t take them to heart either; she\u2019s 16 and probably trying to show out in front of your daughter for whatever reason. However, maybe you had done something to make her uncomfortable before this moment, since you did say she\u2019s been more sarcastic and mean around you.", "Nta that girl is weird as hell do not under any circumstance be alone with her you never know what she could make up.", "NTA. She might have something going on elsewhere in her life which may be inspiring this behavior, but part of being an adult is not taking out one\u2019s issues out on other people, right?  She insinuated you had a sexual interest in a minor, and then she chose to needle you about it while she was a guest in your home. When our kids claim they want to be treated like adults, they seem to think it means acting without consequences, and that\u2019s something only babies can do.", "NTA if a young man had done that to your wife and  she felt uncomfortable in her own home - you wouldn\u2019t expect anything less than to tell the guest to leave.  Why is it any different for you?", "NTA\n\nYou aren't an A for telling a rude teen to leave your house. It was a very smart move. She apparently wasn't making these suggestive comments toward your Daughter or your Wife, so their rightful place in this situation would have been to support your decision. It might be in your best interest to make \"Britt's\" exit her last; you are the one at risk with her making these innuendos.", "NTA. Seems like you were pretty even keeled and it was a fair request. \n\nI think it's fair to tell her that she's always been a good kid, but that she's being inappropriate and she needs to change her behavior if she's going to come over.", "NTA. \n\nLooks like Britt wasn't taught any manners. She can make those inappropriate comments or \"jokes\" to your daughter in private but not to you. Common sense is you are on your best behavior with parents around.\n\nAlso, I suggest you just have the no outdoor footwear policy without needing to explain it's because of new carpet. Outdoor shoes carry and track a lot of stuff. It's why in many cultures, you take them off when you enter a home, and some cultures outside the home.", "NTA it\u2019s your home and she was being inappropriate which made u uncomfortable", "It wasn\u2019t just rude. It was sexual commentary she was making at and about you. Completely inappropriate.  Best she stay out of the house until she can learn some respect.  And so you don\u2019t end up being set up somehow to be a pervert (not that I\u2019m saying you are!). NTA", "What really got me was that she made the second comment about \"I knew I should cover them up\" meaning that in spite of saying it to OP, she would have said it to the daughter too. She would have told Lucy that her dad has a fetish for her (Britt) feet.  And who knows what else she said in the room? So much so that Lucy has to tell her to stop being dramatic. It was discussed.\n\nOP needs to be very careful letting this girl into his home again. SHE is sexualizing HIM, and that's where these fantasies develop and come alive. One odd comment here and there to her friend, her friend group, and instantly,  OP is a skeevy parent, inappropriately checking out minor girls. He needs to be aware that his reputation and character are on the line here. People hear and believe the dirt, never the truth, because the truth is too boring, whereas the accusation is titillating. \n\nNTA... please don't let her back in. And if you do, please NEVER be alone with her.", "NTA this young girl is under provocation and doesn't respect you. Even if she knows you for long, the joke went too far. At 16, you don't talk about fetichism to an adult, and then pretenting this adult had it.", "NTA. \nSounds like she\u2019s over sexualised and it\u2019s a very short step to get yourself in trouble - accusations are far too easy to make.  I suggest avoid her in general and never let yourself be alone with her.", "NTA teens are testing boundries and learning appropriate social behaviour in different context as they become adults instead of children. We are all helping them learn by telling them when it is too far. Too many people do not do this, and it results in problems later on. Teens need this more than ever as they have less  face to face interaction than previous generations and more Internet/ less interaction. Well done for politely setting a boundry and enforcing the consequences.", "NTA and you are protecting yourself by never letting her around again. It only takes one more visit for her to make up a story that you assaulted her when her mean girl attitude isn\u2019t getting her enough attention.", "NTA - Britt seems to be going through a delayed \"rebel\" phase.  Difference being, she practically called you someone fetishising her to your own daughter. That is not - and never will be - okay.", "NTA", "NTA. Those are completely inappropriate jokes for anyone to be making, especially a teenager, ESPECIALLY in today\u2019s world with people getting \u201ccancelled\u201d and their lives being ruined for the slightest misunderstanding with what\u2019s inappropriate and what\u2019s not. I\u2019d have asked her to leave too. That\u2019s all you need is some day in the future she gets mad at something and decides to tell the story about that one time she was at her friend\u2019s house and the dad \u201chad a weird foot fetish\u201d and tried to make her show him her feet\u2026 and then the wrong person hears that\u2026 and then it\u2019s suddenly destroying your life\u2026\u2026. You did the right thing by setting those boundaries now before it could carry on any further.", "NTA\n\nBut if i read stuff like this, i'm so glad our parents raised as good as they did. We didn't even call our friends parents by their first name till we were adults. They were mr & ms \"lastname\" and it was clear we were guests in their house and we were expected to behave as such. We are always welcome in their houses, till this day bc we were never disrespectful or behaved bad.", "If someone disrespects you in your own home you must kick them the fuck out no explanation needed don\u2019t let your wife or anyone else tell you different or you will lose the respect of all of them. No one respects a pushover", "NTA\n\nYeah, nope. The child is a guest in your house and does not get to disrespect you like that.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely disrespectful. I would do the same.", "You are parent of her friend, you are not her buddy. She was extremely inappropriate and weird, I would never imaging to \"joke\" with my friends' parents like that. NTA.", "Nta- she was making you uncomfortable by insinuating you\u2019re a creep. You don\u2019t need to take that in your home. Coming from a 22f btw in case your wife tries to say only men agree \ud83d\ude10", "A sixteen year old girl who is making inappropriate sexualized jokes toward you repeatedly in your own home?  No, thank you.  If anyone thinks this wasn't a big enough deal to kick the girl out of your house, try reversing the genders.  Sexual harassment, anyone?\n\nEither your daughter or you and your wife together  (not you alone, I worry about what this girl could make up) needs to let Britt know that in your house, calling people nasty names (\"pick-me\" girl indeed!) or making inappropriate jokes with sexual innuendos, particularly about parents, will not be tolerated, and she'll both be asked to leave should it happen again.\n\nAnd no sleepovers, no situations in which you could end up alone with Britt.  There's something a little too off about all this, don't put yourself at risk.\n\nNTA", "teenage girls \"joking\" about fetishes of a grown man is what gets grown men in jail for false accusations.\n\nETA: \"Joking\" about sexy things about anyone else can cause a lot of problems. I used the genders **from the story** in my reply. I was in ***NO WAY*** saying 'girls lie all the time and boys rape and get to walk free\". I don't know where any of that came from.\n\nThe **point** is that person 1 in the story is making inappropriate \"jokes\" about a person 2 and that can cause the adult to have a problem later. It just takes 1 pissy person to hear these \"jokes\" and go after OP. It just takes 1 facebook post to cause OP to have to answer serious questions about being inappropriate.", "Never let her in again. And stay in tune to your own daughter\u2019s relationship with her. Britt is going to be a shit influence.", "Well done. Zero tolerance for thst bs. I'd even refuse to let her back over ever.", "NTA. People should learn that they can't act however they want and the others should just take it.", "NTA. It\u2019s your house and no guest should ever make you feel uncomfortable in it by making personal \u2018jokes\u2019 that demean you.", "NTA. She was inappropriate. You were right to send her away.", "NTA. As soon as one of my 15 year old daughter's male friends starts being inappropriate with me (38f), he's banned from the house. Your response was both appropriate and mild, this stuff has to be shut down as soon as it starts.", "NTA, I would ban her completely", "NTA she's accusing you of being a paedophile pervert in your own home and you're the rude one?", "NTA she basically just accused you of being a sexual predator, that shit isn\u2019t funny and your wife should have handled it if she didn\u2019t like how you dealt with it.  These kids think they can talk to adults as if they are adults and they aren\u2019t!  What wasn\u2019t appropriate was how she was acting.", "NTA, she came into your house and accused you of predatory behavior. While her accusations against you do not affect your wife or daughter like the can you. They need to respect that you are eliminating a potential issue for yourself. If you can not feel safe in your own home, then where can you?", "When I was younger, if any of my friends said something like that to my Dad, you better believe they\u2019d never be allowed back to the house. At all.\n\nNTA. Her parents need to discipline her.", "NTA\n\nYou can tell your daughter and wife that she has now implied that you're sexually attracted to her and have even indicated this by asking her remove her shoes to see her feet, when mom and daughter know it was about the new carpet. You don't want to hear that kind of shit, especially from teen girls. She was disrespectful, and had to go. Your daughter needs to tell her this is not cool. You might also have a word with her parents.\n\nThis also means that from now on, she's invited only if she corrects her behaviour towards you, and when your wife is also home. This might limit the time when she can come, but she brought it onto herself. And she should appreciate how little can mess up a man's reputation nowadays.", "NTA. She sounds like the kind of girl who would ruin an adult man's life forever 'as a joke'. You were right to send her home.  Be VERY careful in the future and never be alone with her anywhere, anytime.  She's a walking, talking (potential) sexual harassment  charge.", "NTA that was entirely inappropriate for her to do. I\u2019m a victim of CSA and her gross \u201cjoking\u201d about you sexualizing her is disgusting. She can stay out.

You did what you needed to feel comfortable in your own home. Don't worry you are completely within what you did being reasonable.", "You\u2019re not the asshole, she is. I would have sent her home when I heard her on the stairs. She\u2019s a mouthy 16 year old and that kind of disrespect would not be tolerated in my home also. You don\u2019t have to take any disrespect from anyone, let alone a child. I would be mortified if one of my daughters ever acted that way. Please be careful because she WILL definitely spread this rumor among her friend group. Your daughter will find out the king of person she is.

If she won't, I think it's fine you do, though it's better if your wife does.\n\nFirst, talk to your daughter- together or separate. Explain first off, that it would be incredibly horrible and inappropriate if a Dad ever thought of a 16 year old girl sexually. Then explain that sometimes people say things as an attempt to normalize something that has happened to them, and it's okay if not, but has Britt ever said anything that happened to her? Explain that you ONLY want to make sure she is okay and safe, and if your daughter feels comfortable telling you, if Britt is in further danger, you will do anything you can to keep her safe. If your daughter doesn't share that Britt is in trouble, remind her that even if she feels like it's too much of a betrayal sharing it with you, your daughter needs to tell someone.\n\nRemind her that you want her and all of her friends to be safe, and (again this is maybe better coming from your wife because awkward but...) generally people that are unsafe make such comments.\n\nIf your wife can sit down and talk to Britt, if your daughter doesn't disclose things, that would be great.\n\n80% + something is going on here.

She's not going to trust males. Do what you can. Talk to you daughter, and maybe drop a tip to CPS if your daughter doesn't know anything. Something is wrong here though, and it's for sure not you or your family.\n\nPS- I completely understand the inclination to get her out of there, and it wasn't wrong.

I (40m) have a 16 yo daughter Lucy who has a friend Britt (16f). Britt has been friends with Lucy for years and has been to our house countless times. But recently she has been starting to act out in different ways. She used to be such a nice girl but these days she can be quite sarcastic and mean. \n\nWe recently got a new carpet in our house and my wife made a rule that no one can wear shoes in the house. Britt came over last week and as she was coming in I asked her to take off her shoes. She answered saying \u201cwhy do you have a foot fetish or something\u201d which I just thought was a really weird and inappropriate response (and also I don\u2019t\u2026 but even if I did what would that have to do with anything).

I thought I heard her say your dad is so weird or something as they were going up the stairs.\n\nLater when they came down for some food Britt was wearing some bright pink socks that I assume were Lucy\u2019s as she wasn\u2019t wearing any socks when she went upstairs. They caught my eye and she saw me glance down at them and she said to Lucy \u201csee I knew I should cover them up\u201d which to be fair Lucy replied something like \u201coh shit up Britt stop being dramatic\u201d. Anyway I was feeling uncomfortable so I just said \u201cBritt please can you go home now\u201d she just laughed and said I\u2019m going soon anyway and I said no I want you to leave now please. She got her stuff and left. \n\nAfter that Lucy was mad with me. She said that Britt was only joking and I completely over reacted. My wife also said that she didn\u2019t agree with the way I handled it. It all just felt really off to me though. I don\u2019t know if I should just laugh it off or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Teenagers are not little children without any sexual feelings. Many under 18 year olds have already sex, too.", "Knowing doesn't equal doing. And where I come from, 16 is the age of consent. Not that I'd personally encourage someone to just rush out and lose their virginity as soon as they're legal, but if they chose to, then yes, I'd rather they did know these things beforehand so they can make an informed choice about it! \n\nObviously that doesn't change the fact that Lucy is being rude and inappropriate with the OP, and he was right to kick her out. I'm glad his daughter told her to pack it in too and hope she finds a more respectful friend.", "I would imagine that he was convicted because the judicary evaluated the available evidence & decided that he instigated the encounter, but as I have no detailed information about this, it's purely speculation.\n\nAll I can say is that as they were both below the age of consent, neither of them consented. They did not have the legal capacity to consent. It doesn't matter how many times you write that they consented or it was consenting, that's not the case.\n\nIt's mind boggling that people keep arguing with me about this, because my point was clear & remains objectively true. There's no false accusation in that story. That's all I pointed out. This whole strawman argument thing is getting old, if y'all want to dispute the fairness of that outcome, or whether the law is fit for purpose, you can debate that with someone else, rather than trying to juxtapose it onto my statement.", "Smart! You\u2019re doing the right thing for sure.", "I'm not naive. I'm saying it's inappropriate.", "Just because someone is 16, it does not magically make them mature like an adult, regardless of the law.", "I'm not saying they legally consented. I am saying that they both were ok with it when it happened, so it's not like he raped her. why do you think that only he should be in trouble for it, when she raped him just as much as he raped her?", "NTA. That\u2019s disrespectful and odd.", "If her parents complain just say your not comfortable with children making sexual comments in your house.", "It certainly wouldn't have been productive,  but when she said \"do you have a foot fetish?\" It would have been funny if you replied with \"Yes, but don't worry, your nasty ass hooves are ugly as fuck.\" If she wants to make you uncomfortable, make her self conscious .", "Gen Zs are really sensitive to having their feet exposed. I think youre allowed to ask anyone to leave your house but I do think you kind of were a jerk about it. Maybe she was really uncomfortable about her feet.", "yta. first - the request for taking off her shoes, and changing what she knows as your household normal should have come with an explanation as to why that was changing. If she had been an adult friend of yours, I'm sure you would have included that. Why did you not?\n\nSecond, what blowing up like that almost seems a confirmation that something weird was going on. You should have been a boring parent and explained again why the new rule and that she should make jokes like that - in a boring monotone voice.....but you got all bothered about it which is weird and will only lead to more speculation.", "YTA\n\nBritt is a teenager. She's learning her sense of humor, and when to express it. Sometimes, she misses. \n\nIt seems like in Britt's experience, taking off your shoes when you go in someone's house isn't a thing. This very much varies by family. Some families always remove shoes in the house. Some never do. It's a choice.\n\nBritt wasn't expecting to have to take her shoes off, and her sense of humor came out. Why are you getting weird about a bit of low-grade snark from a teenager - aren't you the adult in the story?", "Yta you're such a little baby. My god. I hope they make fun of you for years over this", "Why is you daughter allowing her to say that?", "Maybe he shouldn't take it to heart but he should take it seriously.  As most people take sexual accusations from a minor about an adult seriously, and should.  If she says any of this outside the house he could be ruined.  Even when a comment is proven to be fake, even when the kid takes it back, it's hard to recover from that sort of thing.\n\nThese are snotty jokes coming from a snotty teenager, yes.  But they're beyond snotty they're inappropriate and dangerous.  It needs to be taken seriously for the sake of those who see it as a joke, for those who are the butt of these \"jokes\", and also for those who are really in a situation where they're really being preyed on.\n\nu/throwra127949 it might be time to explain this to your daughter, talk to her adult to adult, without confrontation.  These things are jokes to teenagers but they can get serious very quickly.  There's the issue of being respected in your own home, which should be addressed, but there's also a safety issue.", "Ya know, I never had to have that sort of conversation with my parents when I was a kid cause I didn\u2019t have any friends but I feel that this is a great conversation to have\u2026. Filing this away for future me when I have children in close proximity to myself.", "Yeah, I suspect this is also the case. Asking her to leave was the right thing to do, it\u2019ll help her learn situational judgement and when it is/isn\u2019t appropriate to make jokes like that", "I completely disagree with the comment above (about being mean not to ever have her come back). A teenager makes accusations of you having a sexual fetish and targeting her TWICE. Honestly, it would be stupid to allow her in your house and give her an opportunity to do it again. It's a joke until she says it's not. What's next? She's not happy about something you did/said and then makes a full-blown accusation?\n\nEveryone saying teenager says stupid things. I was a stupid teenager once, and I would NEVER joke about that with a friend's dad.", "Some teens just like testing boundaries, when being mean is cool and funny. Only its not but most other teens are too afraid to call them out. Overreacting to Britt right away may have caused Lucy a lot of headache.", "Completely agree - it\u2019s the second comment that is the most concerning. The first one could fall into the \u201caccidentally made a joke I would make with my friends to the wrong person\u201d category.  But bringing it up a second time or even paying attention to the fact that the OP glanced at her feet? To me that is super concerning and definitely point to intentionality with the first comment. \nI personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable having the girl over at my house anymore. And I would also make sure I explained things to my daughter. The fact that she was already telling her friend to knock it off is a good sign. I know that when I was a teenager if one of my friends had done that it would have really squicked me out.", "She is 16, making a cringe joke. Strike a match and lighten tf up", "My dad would never let my sister or I have for sleepovers if my mom wasn't home, even when we were in grade school just to avoid the potential of it looking bad. He said he never wanted to give their parents an opportunity to worry that something might happen to their daughters.", "The first time she said it, I could accept that as a joke. But she **kept doing it**even though nobody found it funny. She\u2019s not trying to be funny, she\u2019s trying to create an uncomfortable situation for this guy\u2026 at best.", "Lots of people walk around barefoot indoors. For that matter, a lot of people walk around OUTSIDE with bare feet", "Yeah, this is a bad situation and OP is within his right to remove her from his home before she escalates.", "Fun trivia fact. \"Edge lord\" was one of the new terms added to Webster's Dictionary this year even though it's been around for years.", "This is what I was leaning towards, turns into a he said/she said situation. A 16yof commenting on a 40yom sexual preferences,  joking or not, sounds like a set up to a bad Law and order SVU episode. My stipulation would be friend can only come over when you wife is there as well. If she's getting her kicks out of making you uncomfortable and it just worked and you offended her by asking her to leave what is she willing to do next time.. OP NTA be very wary", "It also depends on the laws of a country. Nothing would have happened to him where I live even if he raped her. At 12 someone could murder another 12 years old and still not go to prison. My country treat children that age as the children they are who are not mentally fully developed yet.", "It is not safe for OP or their family to have a child who has accused OP of harbouring sexual thoughts about her in their home. \n\nOP is not a social worker or psychologist, or child protection worker.

I would not allow her to come over anymore, or at the very least, make sure to never be alone with her, not even for a couple of minutes while the daughter is using the bathroom. Somebody like that could ruin OP's entire life.", "Sorry to hear that. Honestly, we need laws to punish people (even teens) for making these types of accusations. There has to be consequences cuz they know what they're doing after a certain age.", "I don't believe your friend at all. Sorry.", "The first part really depends on the country. I think the majority of countries don't punish minors as harsh as adults. \n\nThough she should still know better.", "The same happened to me. And I bet with time, you won't miss her at all. And will make friends who truly respect you :)", "Im not saying that she should never be asked to leave - I am saying she should not be banned. there is a difference \n\nbeing asked to leave if she is pushing boundaries that she has been told are limits with consequences, such as making sexual comments about the dad - being asked to leave immediately by the household member that hears her is a very appropriate response \n\n\"(name) you have been told that comments like that are not acceptable in this house as you know full well it is not true and would be very harmful to everyone in this house if anyone thought for even a minute that it was true. You need to leave now, you may return in 72 hours and try again\"", "As a woman, I normally err on the side of \"believe women\" but I knew someone like this, and people like this are incredibly dangerous. A former classmate of mine who has accused every person she's ever dated of either r-ing her (not sure if I can use that word in this sub) or abusing her. Every. single. one. I know some people are in a pattern of abusive relationships but the first incident was when we were in school and she pursued a guy, harassed him and when he publicly rejected her at a party (because he'd told her no multiple times, and she wouldn't hear it), she claimed he attacked her and badly hurt her. Multiple people witnessed it and said he didn't even touch her (just yelled at her to please leave him alone), including her own friends, they were baffled by the accusation. \n\nNow I follow her on social media just to see what the latest controversy is, and she has literally publicly accused every person she's ever dated of crimes. Funny enough, when I look up court records, she's had multiple restraining orders out against her by some of these men, but none have ever been charged with the crimes she accuses them of. I can't believe she hasn't been sued or charged herself.\n\nAnd it's not just men. She has had multiple public falling outs with relatives, friends, etc, and always accuses them of awful things/crimes/abuse. It's incredibly bizarre, and her legion of social media followers seem to believe her without question.\n\nI'm sure she's very, very ill, but it doesn't change the fact that she's dangerous to be around. I think some people are like this, as soon as they get mad at someone, are told no or have a falling out, they go straight to the false accusations. She's the only person I've ever known who is like this, but it's truly chilling.\n\nI get why you want to protect your husband and your kids. I think it's very rare for people to lie about things like this, but when it does happen, it's so incredibly dangerous.", "That's an incredible story.\n\nSo sorry to hear that happened to your family. Honestly,  people like your cousin is a predator of a different type.\n\nDefinitely good decision not to let her near your husband and kids.", ">She's the modern day Boy Who Called Wolf. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Meh0cAv", "Who gives a fuck?", "And the whole thing with my cousin is so sad. And she wasn't like this until she started spending more time with her mother after being taken away at a young age. She used to be so sweet and loving. She's been through therapy and other things as well growing up to help her get through the hardship of being taken away from her awful mother and losing her father to epilepsy before she was born. We did all we could to try to help her be successful and thrive. And then she started down the path she is on and refuses to see what she is doing is wrong and how she is hurting everyone around her. In our very last conversation we had before I went NC she told me that the only good people in our family are her and her mother and how everyone else are monsters.", "Oh jeez. That's chilling."]}
