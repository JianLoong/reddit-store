Luck is always a factor, and it sounds like you have plenty of experience too. You didn't embarass him, he embarassed himself by making fun of you and then losing. A good life lesson about not being a jerk. \n\nAlso, if you enjoy battling (or want to give him a real surprise next time), EV training is very easy to do in SV. The way that requires the least amount of Learning A New Thing is using the first dlc balloon minigame. Clear mochi resets EVS, and each other mochi gives something like 10 EVs for a specific stat. Each pokemon can have up to 252 in a stat and only two can be maxed out (total of 510 EVs max). Examine their stats while they're in your party and you can toggle to see their current EV spread. Grind the game for a bit and you can get your team a little more optimized. Sites like Smogon will usually help give an idea of which two stats to prioritize for each beast. Not that it matters that much, apparently!", "NTA you raised him he's also in a way your Pok\u00e9mon. The kid got cocky and challenged the master and got schooled. \nAlso, you're playing Pokemon the best way all these EV trainers have sucked the joy out of Pokemon.", "NTA.  Love comes in many forms.  Enjoy this moment.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't dish out anything if he cant take the loss\n\nHe needed humility and should learn respect", "NTA knowing how to take a loss and bounce back is a great skill in life. He'd be mad for a bit but whatever lol.  Seeth and cope", "NTA  \nHe embarassed himself by being a little t\\*rd. you're probably playing those games longer than he is alive.  \nDon't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk. Or as they said in Mandalorian \"One doesn't speak unless they know.\"", "NTA, you laid a smackdown on him and he can't take it.", "NTA - obviously he needs to make a stronger bond with his pokemon lol", "Bruh, he had EV trained Pok\u00e9mon, you didn\u2019t and he lost. He got schooled. He needs to git gud.\n\nI\u2019m all seriousness, he needs to learn to lose with eloquence. No one likes a sore loser. If I was him, I\u2019d be happy to have a mom that can kick ass in Pok\u00e9mon!", "NTA. As children and later teens, I remember my friends and I feeling thrilled whenever we found out one of parents was good at something we enjoyed, it was even more exciting if they turned out to be significantly better.", "Heh, NTA", "NTA - as someone who played competetively. reading your opponent is many times more important than just having big stats", "NTA I used to test my songle type teams by hopping onto the online battle free for all and you'd have lots of varied teams with legendaries but no strategy.\n\nPeople who use ppkemon they just like tend to know how to use said pokemon.\n\nYour son sounds like someone who min maxes and does the meta and those people can be the worst.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
