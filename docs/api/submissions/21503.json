The relationship has been going great and I love how amazing she is but lately I have been tired.\n\nWe decided to move in a new apartment 2 months ago and I also took a new job. The new job has been a bit stressful compared to my last job. Luckily I am still getting time for my personal hobbies like gym and going out with Sarah.\n\nNow the problem I want to talk about is my lack of sleep. I have been sleeping alone since I was 15 years old and now sleeping with someone else is kinda bothering to me. I am used to the peace of sleeping alone.\n\nMy girlfriend likes to sleep with a low fan sleep, takes up too much space in bed ans most importantly she snores sometimes which ruins my sleep completely. She also no concern for my sleep as she wakes up before me and either switches on lights or makes noises. I am used to sleeping 7-8 hours a day but for the past few months I have been sleeping only 4-5 hours because of this.\n\nSo finally I got frustrated and confronted her about this. I know my girlfriend can't change in a day so I proposed I will just sleep in the other room peacefully.\n\nShe got upset and was furious about this suggestion. She believes sleeping together is a sign of love between a couple and that she likes cuddling or sleeping on top of me and says I should get used to it.\n\nShe now thinks that I don't find her attractive but that isn't true at all.

Surely there is a way to work out a system where she doesn't have to turn on the lights and/or make noise?  Maybe a nightlight?  Can she prep her clothing night before and get dressed in other room?   The bed hogging you may need to fight for that, as in push her away onto her side of the bed.   The snoring may be a medical condition and she may need to look into that.  In any case, her disregard for your well being is very selfish and her telling you to that you should get used to is is entitled.  Red flags galore on the 'me me me' g/f.", "NTA. Sleeping in the same bed is not a requirement of any relationship. If it's important to her and you're willing to try again, tell her you need an adjustment period to acclimate yourself to sleeping together. It's the same concept as quitting an addiction or habit; going cold turkey can make things a lot harder for people and sometimes it's best to ease into the change. You're still getting used to sleeping together and sometimes need a night alone to get adequate sleep until you adjust to each other's sleeping patterns, schedules, and habits.", "NTA, a lot of couples find that sleeping in different rooms is healthier and happier for both of them.", "NTA.  It's becoming more common for homes to be built with his and hers bedrooms.  Now that we better understand the importance of sleep on total health it's a great time to start updating old traditions. Just make sure you commit to some snuggle time so you're not ignoring her needs.  Compromise is king.", "NTA. Sure, she is allowed to want to sleep with her partner, but IMO she doesn't have a right to be upset at you when it is literally HER OWN FAULT that you're so sleep deprived.\n\nSleep deprivation is literally a form of torture. I'd be concerned that my partner was putting her own needs above your need for sleep. Like, I'm sorry, but the minute she chose to act like you're wrong for not wanting to share a bed with her, she became the AH.\n\nI also like sleeping with my partner most nights.. but I also go out of my way to ensure I'm not waking him up. If she wants to share a bed with you, she needs to accept that she is being massively disruptive. You're NTA for wanting something that is LITERALLY REQUIRED TO KEEP HUMANS HEALTHY.\n\ntbh her stance is massively selfish and I'd be questioning if this is the only thing she's so selfish about.", "NTA. I think that's very reasonable request. However, it's possible she sleeps better with you in bed. I sleep much much better when I'm cuddling my boyfriend, although I do get up first to leave to work as well. I do not disturb him much before leaving. Maybe you can come to a compromise and split it every other day you guys sleep together? I would be pretty upset if my partner suggested this to me, and I too may feel a bit like something is wrong with the relationship. Just communicate with her and make sure she doesn't feel less than and that you just need some extra sleep.", "Petty me wants you to blow a whistle every time she wakes you up throughout the night.", "NTA.

I would try to work with her on what you need to get good rest.  She has to respect that if she respects you.", "NTA, she thinks you need to get used to her sleeping on top of you?

As everyone else mentioned, co sleeping can be super healthy and it\u2019s definitely not unreasonable of you to want this. But some people also sleep better when they\u2019re cuddling someone, and it sounds like your girlfriend sleeps better with you in the bed. Maybe you could work out a compromise where you sleep together some nights and apart some nights, maybe the more you sleep together the more you\u2019ll get used to it.\n\nIt\u2019s weird that she turns the lights on and makes a lot of noise when she wakes up, if you do end up sharing a bed you should talk to her about being more respectful of your sleep in the mornings. And she needs to get better about not taking up the whole bed, I personally roll a lot in my sleep and I like having the whole bed to myself but I\u2019ve learned to share while having partners.\n\nYour sleep is so important for your health, so I hope you find an arrangement that benefits both of you!", "Nta if you have the space, sleeping apart is great.\n\nIf she's resistant tell her that she needs to change *her* sleeping habits instead of you only you losing out on sleep.

Keep track and point out every time she inconsiderately wakes you up.", "NTA when my snoring was disturbing my boyfriend's ability to get a good night's sleep I started trying to fix it and good thing I did because after a sleep study, getting an app that records my sleep etc it turns out I have severe obstructive sleep apnea. A mouth guard mitigated more of the snoring and then I lost about 15lbs and I stopped snoring and was able to discontinue the mouth guard. I love cuddling my boyfriend and sleeping in the same bed but everyone needs their sleep.", "NTA but I can see why she might be upset.  Maybe melatonin can  help you sleep.  My parents slept in their own rooms until my father passed, so I can see it both ways.  It took me a long time to adapt to sharing a bed and we've been together 25 yrs.", "You two should not live together. I feel the same way as your girlfriend.

Since it takes time, sometimes it makes sense to maintain your independence in an area while you work out what the best \"protocol\" will be for doing something together. It's totally valid that if right now you can't figure out a way to both get a good night sleep, that in the short term you both do what works for you independently while in the long term you work on a strategy for being able to sleep together happily. Sleep deprivation is emotionally and physically damaging and will cause a lot of resentment. You can't just accept that as a fact of the relationship. You need to have a way to sleep.\n\nShe is in control over whether you sleep in the other room because the reasons you're saying you are doing it are things she can address (and none of them have to do with the reason she's replacing them with about attractiveness). She needs to learn to hear her partner and to put her energy into fixing the problem. If she wants you to sleep in the same room, she can put her energy into addressing the reasons you provided for not being able to sleep in the same room. Instead, she's ignoring those reasons.\n\nI have been in your position... a partner that snored, liked noise to sleep, took up too much of the bed, being on very different sleep schedules, etc. Once we no longer lived in a one room apartment, we made the rule that the sleeping person always gets priority of the bedroom. So, if your gf wants to wake up early, it's on her to go to a different room to be light and loud. We got a bigger bed. She went for a sleep study and now has a CPAP instead of snoring (and she gets a better night sleep as a result!) Before then, she told me to always feel comfortable waking her if she was snoring too loud..sometimes I'd do that and other times I'd just sleep somewhere else for the rest of the night. For the noise that she needs, she started using headphones and small phone or tablet that only she could see. We also got a sound machine and that helps drown out the noise so that she can even sometimes put her speakers on very likely without bothering me.\n\nThe theme of all of this is that we listen to each other's needs and we tried to come up with things to do in response. The way we sleep now is enormously different from the way we did when we first met. You don't succeed in a long term relationship if you just want to be a the same person doing the same thing and insist that somebody else does that thing with you. (i.e. what your gf is doing). You succeed by recognizing what areas your guys conflict with each other and then either learning a new strategy so that you're no longer in conflict (i.e. changing your sleep routines/rules) or choosing your battles (i.e. sleeping apart for a bit).", "NTA- sometimes sleep styles are too different. I love my husband, but he wants to fall asleep to the TV and I want quiet or rain sounds. He comes to bed hours later than I do, and once he falls asleep he snores like a lumberjack sawing logs. We definitely had separate spaces for a while, when we had enough space that we could each have a bedroom, and it helped our relationship because I wasn't a cranky tired jerk all the time.", "NTA. My hubby and I (together for 18 years) sometimes sleep seperate for various reasons. \n\nOne of them is that i snore (not sometimes, pretty much every night and loud, seriously), if it bothers him too much, he moves to the guestroom, so he doesnt have to keep shoving me until i stop \ud83d\ude06 \nSometimes, especially after a rough night for him, i go sleep in the guestroom the next night, so he can get a full nights sleep.\n\nSometimes one of us stays up later, then that person will sleep in the guestroom, as to not disturb the one already sleeping.\n\nSure we love cuddling and i love sleeping together, but sometimes, sleep is more important. Lack of sleep results in grumpyness, no energy, apathy, etc which is NOT the partner one wants to be.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. She\u2019s being selfish. You\u2019re being sleep deprived is more important than her feeling lonely while she\u2019s sleeping.", "NTA everyone deserves good sleep. And it's incredibly disrespectful for her to make a ruckus just because she wakes up first. She just sounds immature. I'm not sure if you've had a conversation breaking down each individual problem and suggesting solutions. Like no lights when she first wakes up so you can sleep longer for example. But if you have and she's not willing to make accommodations, then I'd say y'all are not compatible.", "I\u2019m all about the separate bedrooms. This should be normalized in relationships. I slept next to someone for over sixteen years before that ran a fan on high, snored like a freight train, came to bed late and woke me up, slept through his alarm multiple times a day, and blew the stench of Marlboro reds and rum in my general direction. Smothering with a pillow was unfortunately not and option, so the spare room it was.", "This could be a dealbreaker. I'm reading so many couples below sleep apart and it's the key to their happiness. Sleeping in bed with my husband is one of my favorite parts of being married. I hate sleeping alone. I hate when we're apart one night. I don't know if I could be as happy with him if we didn't both loving sharing a bed. But you are also totally allowed to want to sleep alone!!! But it's also fair for her to not accept it. She cannot force you, but you both have to remember you are talking about sleeping arrangements for the rest of your lives, so it's not something to take lightly.", "NTA\n\nBeing able to understand the benefits of separate rooms is a game changer. I snore and sleep easier than my wife. I\u2019m sure our relationship wouldn\u2019t have lasted if we were forced to always sleep in the same bed", "NTA.\n\nThis is important to your health and also relationship. If you carry on like this, you will just start to resent her", "NTA. The big thing here is that relationships are built on compromise.  You need to sleep alone to get a good night's rest.  She feels that part of a healthy relationship is sleeping together.  Is there any way you can sit down and figure out some way they you both get what you want?  Maybe sleeping together on certain nights?  Changing certain habits when you are sleeping together/apart?", "NTA I am going through the exact same thing with my gf. Can't sleep for shit with another human, love her to bits.", "Sarah believes I am being selfish not taking into account that she would feel lonely sleeping alone and that is making me doubt myself", "I would try to work with her on what you need to get good rest. She has to respect that if she respects you.", "Thank you. She is wonderful and caring person but kinda acts a bit immature when it comes to these things. She scrolls TikTok a lot and there are many \"perfect relationship\" videos on her feed which she even shows me. I think that is part of why she is holding on this idea", "I think I should communicate this to Sarah , thank you for this", "I tried explaining her this but she just thinks I am being selfish", "Yup surely I will talk about the compromise.\n\nAlso may I ask since you are into this, do you cuddle daily and does it bother you or your boyfriend sometimes? My girlfriend on most days wants me to sleep without a t-shirt and  then sleeps on top of me with her head on my chest and then sniffs me and keeps kissing me. \n\nI find it lovely but sometimes I don't like her body weight on me whilesleeping or sleeping without a tshirt. I don't know how to bring it up that her lovemaking is little uncomfortable at times", "Sorry a typo , *3 years", "Yup we do that a lot. The first thing I do after waking up and having a bath so go hug her in the kitchen for around 3-4 mins. Intimacy is very important for us. Maybe thats why she doesn't want to sleep alone", "Maybe a nightlight? Can she prep her clothing night before and get dressed in other room?", "Whay you read is true. 7-8 hours of healthy sleep can literally solve 70% of my your problems", "I said 'confronted' because I have mentioned these things to her earlier but she has just ignored or forgot about it.", "Yup someone else also suggested a compromise of sleeping together and apart for a few days. I am going to talk to her about this in a calm manner maybe my tone was a bit confrontational when I told her this.", "But what compromises is she willing to make to help you sleep as well? She refuses to work on any of the things she does that are preventing you from sleeping and calls you selfish for not wanting to be sleep deprived to keep her from feeling lonely while she's sleeping.", "Dude, she's being super selfish and has no consideration for you and your needs. Turning the light on when your partner is still sleeping is selfish and inconsiderate as fuck. Trying to cuddle or sleep on top of someone who likes space when they're sleeping is selfish. Taking up more than your fair share of the bed is selfish if done on purpose. \n\nI get that you don't want to make her feel lonely, but only sleeping 4-5 hours a night is terrible for your health. It will eventually take a major toll on you and your mood and thus also possibly start to negatively affect your relationship.", "Idk mate, that sounds like a maturity problem on her part. \ud83e\udee0", "She was fine sleeping alone before you moved in together lol.", "How about her selfishness of not caring about your sleep??", "Not for Sarah, because she sounds incredibly selfish and manipulative, but in the future, a king sized bed will do wonders for your sleep. It\u2019s like sleeping alone. But you can still cuddle as you\u2019re falling asleep. It\u2019s heaven. \n\nSleep compatibility is real. You cannot sacrifice sleep.\n\nETA: the fact that she turns on the lights and doesn\u2019t try to be quiet while you\u2019re sleeping is a big red flag for me. A loving partner cares about your well-being and sleep is a prerequisite for wellbeing/sanity/daily functionality.", "> when it comes to these things\n\nLike your well being?  I'm sorry but based on what you said in your post, she is not a caring person, she's selfish.", "She has no respect for your sleeping well being and she thinks YOU'RE being selfish?  Total BS.", "Communication is definitely very important.\n\nI have never been bothered by him, although sometimes he gets hot as the AC in our home isn't the best and he doesn't want to cuddle on the nights when its super hot. I think that's totally fair and I respect that. Though we do still sleep next to each other just not holding each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend takes his shirt off anyways so I'm not too sure about that, but I wouldn't care whether he slept with or without a shirt. I usually keep my shirt on while sleeping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the sleeping on top of you definitely sounds uncomfortable, I generally sleep next to him and he has his arms around me, I don't sleep on top of him. When I do its usually in the day while we're watching TV or something. It doesn't sound like a very comfortable sleeping position to me. The sniffing and kissing you is a bit odd? I can definitely see how you would be bothered/awoken by that. I usually just immediately pass out so I'm not doing anything other than laying there like a log lol", "**NAH** - Long-term I'd encourage you to try out other solutions other than just sleeping in separate rooms, though getting a night or two to stabilize your sleep pattern in the spare room shouldn't be a problem. I bet Sarah is just worried you don't ever want to sleep together anymore, and going from sleeping together to separate rooms is a big change. This sounds like a growing pain of living with an SO that you should find a suitable middle-ground for.", "Good ideas. Little things like that could go a long way.", "I hope she understands this when we sit down to talk again", "Yeah when your partner is still sleeping you quietly gather what you need and leave quietly, sometimes I fall over noisily but that is a specific me issue. If it is a regular thing you have your stuff either ready to take or in a different room.", "Yeah she is a bit of a pain in the ass when I am not being the dream TikTok boyfriend , aside from that a lovely woman", "I hope she understands she is being unreasonable", "Thank you. This is all new to me so I thought maybe this was normal. Will bring it up surely.", "Yeah, I think I should calmly talk to her about how big of a change is this for me when she cools down", "I'm also clumsy and uncoordinated so I have to try my hardest not to bang into things in the dark. I might stub my toe on occasion, but I'd rather do that than be inconsiderate and turn on the lights waking up my partner.", "so she's only lovely when you're putting up to impossible internet standards as dictated by the viral meme of the day? because she's definitely not lovely when using you as her unfortunately-animate body pillow and disregarding your literal health.", "Oh no. I\u2019d nope right out of a relationship with someone that was comparing us to TikToks. I\u2019d expect that out of a 15yo not someone approaching 30. \n\nAlso, becoming more and more normalized for couples to sleep in separate beds or bedrooms so that they can, you know, sleep. \nYou can have sex and cuddle and still go to your bedroom and sleep. \n\nYou say she likes to sleep on top of you, but you don\u2019t like that! A good gf would understand and compromise on this. She would care about your comfort as much as yours! \n\n But immature people who think that TikTok and romcoms are what they should pattern their relationships off of are an immediate nope imo.  Every relationship has different needs and shouldn\u2019t be judged based on fictional stereotypes.", "Sleep deprivation is literally a form of torture, a war crime prohibited by the Geneva convention.  So there\u2019s that.", "No problem! Good luck, you definitely sound like you care for her very much. I hope all goes well :)"]}
