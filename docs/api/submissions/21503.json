The relationship has been going great and I love how amazing she is but lately I have been tired.\n\nWe decided to move in a new apartment 2 months ago and I also took a new job. The new job has been a bit stressful compared to my last job. Luckily I am still getting time for my personal hobbies like gym and going out with Sarah.\n\nNow the problem I want to talk about is my lack of sleep. I have been sleeping alone since I was 15 years old and now sleeping with someone else is kinda bothering to me. I am used to the peace of sleeping alone.\n\nMy girlfriend likes to sleep with a low fan sleep, takes up too much space in bed ans most importantly she snores sometimes which ruins my sleep completely. She also no concern for my sleep as she wakes up before me and either switches on lights or makes noises. I am used to sleeping 7-8 hours a day but for the past few months I have been sleeping only 4-5 hours because of this.\n\nSo finally I got frustrated and confronted her about this. I know my girlfriend can't change in a day so I proposed I will just sleep in the other room peacefully.\n\nShe got upset and was furious about this suggestion. She believes sleeping together is a sign of love between a couple and that she likes cuddling or sleeping on top of me and says I should get used to it.\n\nShe now thinks that I don't find her attractive but that isn't true at all.

Can she prep her clothing night before and get dressed in other room?   The bed hogging you may need to fight for that, as in push her away onto her side of the bed.

Sleeping in the same bed is not a requirement of any relationship. If it's important to her and you're willing to try again, tell her you need an adjustment period to acclimate yourself to sleeping together. It's the same concept as quitting an addiction or habit; going cold turkey can make things a lot harder for people and sometimes it's best to ease into the change.

It's becoming more common for homes to be built with his and hers bedrooms.  Now that we better understand the importance of sleep on total health it's a great time to start updating old traditions.

Sure, she is allowed to want to sleep with her partner, but IMO she doesn't have a right to be upset at you when it is literally HER OWN FAULT that you're so sleep deprived.\n\nSleep deprivation is literally a form of torture.

Like, I'm sorry, but the minute she chose to act like you're wrong for not wanting to share a bed with her, she became the AH.\n\nI also like sleeping with my partner most nights.. but I also go out of my way to ensure I'm not waking him up. If she wants to share a bed with you, she needs to accept that she is being massively disruptive.

Maybe you can come to a compromise and split it every other day you guys sleep together?

As everyone else mentioned, co sleeping can be super healthy and it\u2019s definitely not unreasonable of you to want this.

Since it takes time, sometimes it makes sense to maintain your independence in an area while you work out what the best \"protocol\" will be for doing something together. It's totally valid that if right now you can't figure out a way to both get a good night sleep, that in the short term you both do what works for you independently while in the long term you work on a strategy for being able to sleep together happily. Sleep deprivation is emotionally and physically damaging and will cause a lot of resentment. You can't just accept that as a fact of the relationship. You need to have a way to sleep.\n\nShe is in control over whether you sleep in the other room because the reasons you're saying you are doing it are things she can address (and none of them have to do with the reason she's replacing them with about attractiveness). She needs to learn to hear her partner and to put her energy into fixing the problem. If she wants you to sleep in the same room, she can put her energy into addressing the reasons you provided for not being able to sleep in the same room. Instead, she's ignoring those reasons.\n\nI have been in your position... a partner that snored, liked noise to sleep, took up too much of the bed, being on very different sleep schedules, etc. Once we no longer lived in a one room apartment, we made the rule that the sleeping person always gets priority of the bedroom. So, if your gf wants to wake up early, it's on her to go to a different room to be light and loud. We got a bigger bed. She went for a sleep study and now has a CPAP instead of snoring (and she gets a better night sleep as a result!) Before then, she told me to always feel comfortable waking her if she was snoring too loud..sometimes I'd do that and other times I'd just sleep somewhere else for the rest of the night. For the noise that she needs, she started using headphones and small phone or tablet that only she could see. We also got a sound machine and that helps drown out the noise so that she can even sometimes put her speakers on very likely without bothering me.\n\nThe theme of all of this is that we listen to each other's needs and we tried to come up with things to do in response. The way we sleep now is enormously different from the way we did when we first met. You don't succeed in a long term relationship if you just want to be a the same person doing the same thing and insist that somebody else does that thing with you. (i.e. what your gf is doing). You succeed by recognizing what areas your guys conflict with each other and then either learning a new strategy so that you're no longer in conflict (i.e. changing your sleep routines/rules) or choosing your battles (i.e. sleeping apart for a bit).", "NTA- sometimes sleep styles are too different. I love my husband, but he wants to fall asleep to the TV and I want quiet or rain sounds. He comes to bed hours later than I do, and once he falls asleep he snores like a lumberjack sawing logs. We definitely had separate spaces for a while, when we had enough space that we could each have a bedroom, and it helped our relationship because I wasn't a cranky tired jerk all the time.", "NTA. My hubby and I (together for 18 years) sometimes sleep seperate for various reasons. \n\nOne of them is that i snore (not sometimes, pretty much every night and loud, seriously), if it bothers him too much, he moves to the guestroom, so he doesnt have to keep shoving me until i stop \ud83d\ude06 \nSometimes, especially after a rough night for him, i go sleep in the guestroom the next night, so he can get a full nights sleep.\n\nSometimes one of us stays up later, then that person will sleep in the guestroom, as to not disturb the one already sleeping.\n\nSure we love cuddling and i love sleeping together, but sometimes, sleep is more important. Lack of sleep results in grumpyness, no energy, apathy, etc which is NOT the partner one wants to be.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. She\u2019s being selfish. You\u2019re being sleep deprived is more important than her feeling lonely while she\u2019s sleeping.", "NTA everyone deserves good sleep. And it's incredibly disrespectful for her to make a ruckus just because she wakes up first. She just sounds immature. I'm not sure if you've had a conversation breaking down each individual problem and suggesting solutions. Like no lights when she first wakes up so you can sleep longer for example. But if you have and she's not willing to make accommodations, then I'd say y'all are not compatible.", "I\u2019m all about the separate bedrooms. This should be normalized in relationships. I slept next to someone for over sixteen years before that ran a fan on high, snored like a freight train, came to bed late and woke me up, slept through his alarm multiple times a day, and blew the stench of Marlboro reds and rum in my general direction. Smothering with a pillow was unfortunately not and option, so the spare room it was.", "This could be a dealbreaker. I'm reading so many couples below sleep apart and it's the key to their happiness. Sleeping in bed with my husband is one of my favorite parts of being married. I hate sleeping alone. I hate when we're apart one night. I don't know if I could be as happy with him if we didn't both loving sharing a bed. But you are also totally allowed to want to sleep alone!!! But it's also fair for her to not accept it. She cannot force you, but you both have to remember you are talking about sleeping arrangements for the rest of your lives, so it's not something to take lightly.", "NTA\n\nBeing able to understand the benefits of separate rooms is a game changer. I snore and sleep easier than my wife. I\u2019m sure our relationship wouldn\u2019t have lasted if we were forced to always sleep in the same bed", "NTA.\n\nThis is important to your health and also relationship. If you carry on like this, you will just start to resent her", "NTA. The big thing here is that relationships are built on compromise.  You need to sleep alone to get a good night's rest.  She feels that part of a healthy relationship is sleeping together.  Is there any way you can sit down and figure out some way they you both get what you want?  Maybe sleeping together on certain nights?  Changing certain habits when you are sleeping together/apart?", "NTA I am going through the exact same thing with my gf. Can't sleep for shit with another human, love her to bits.", "Sarah believes I am being selfish not taking into account that she would feel lonely sleeping alone and that is making me doubt myself", "I would try to work with her on what you need to get good rest. She has to respect that if she respects you.", "Thank you. She is wonderful and caring person but kinda acts a bit immature when it comes to these things. She scrolls TikTok a lot and there are many \"perfect relationship\" videos on her feed which she even shows me. I think that is part of why she is holding on this idea", "I think I should communicate this to Sarah , thank you for this", "I tried explaining her this but she just thinks I am being selfish", "Yup surely I will talk about the compromise.\n\nAlso may I ask since you are into this, do you cuddle daily and does it bother you or your boyfriend sometimes? My girlfriend on most days wants me to sleep without a t-shirt and  then sleeps on top of me with her head on my chest and then sniffs me and keeps kissing me. \n\nI find it lovely but sometimes I don't like her body weight on me whilesleeping or sleeping without a tshirt. I don't know how to bring it up that her lovemaking is little uncomfortable at times", "Sorry a typo , *3 years", "Yup we do that a lot. The first thing I do after waking up and having a bath so go hug her in the kitchen for around 3-4 mins. Intimacy is very important for us. Maybe thats why she doesn't want to sleep alone", "Maybe a nightlight? Can she prep her clothing night before and get dressed in other room?", "Whay you read is true. 7-8 hours of healthy sleep can literally solve 70% of my your problems", "I said 'confronted' because I have mentioned these things to her earlier but she has just ignored or forgot about it.", "Yup someone else also suggested a compromise of sleeping together and apart for a few days. I am going to talk to her about this in a calm manner maybe my tone was a bit confrontational when I told her this.", "But what compromises is she willing to make to help you sleep as well? She refuses to work on any of the things she does that are preventing you from sleeping and calls you selfish for not wanting to be sleep deprived to keep her from feeling lonely while she's sleeping.", "Dude, she's being super selfish and has no consideration for you and your needs. Turning the light on when your partner is still sleeping is selfish and inconsiderate as fuck. Trying to cuddle or sleep on top of someone who likes space when they're sleeping is selfish. Taking up more than your fair share of the bed is selfish if done on purpose. \n\nI get that you don't want to make her feel lonely, but only sleeping 4-5 hours a night is terrible for your health. It will eventually take a major toll on you and your mood and thus also possibly start to negatively affect your relationship.", "Idk mate, that sounds like a maturity problem on her part. \ud83e\udee0", "She was fine sleeping alone before you moved in together lol.", "How about her selfishness of not caring about your sleep??", "Not for Sarah, because she sounds incredibly selfish and manipulative, but in the future, a king sized bed will do wonders for your sleep. It\u2019s like sleeping alone. But you can still cuddle as you\u2019re falling asleep. It\u2019s heaven. \n\nSleep compatibility is real. You cannot sacrifice sleep.\n\nETA: the fact that she turns on the lights and doesn\u2019t try to be quiet while you\u2019re sleeping is a big red flag for me. A loving partner cares about your well-being and sleep is a prerequisite for wellbeing/sanity/daily functionality.", "> when it comes to these things\n\nLike your well being?  I'm sorry but based on what you said in your post, she is not a caring person, she's selfish.", "She has no respect for your sleeping well being and she thinks YOU'RE being selfish?  Total BS.", "Communication is definitely very important.\n\nI have never been bothered by him, although sometimes he gets hot as the AC in our home isn't the best and he doesn't want to cuddle on the nights when its super hot. I think that's totally fair and I respect that. Though we do still sleep next to each other just not holding each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend takes his shirt off anyways so I'm not too sure about that, but I wouldn't care whether he slept with or without a shirt. I usually keep my shirt on while sleeping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the sleeping on top of you definitely sounds uncomfortable, I generally sleep next to him and he has his arms around me, I don't sleep on top of him. When I do its usually in the day while we're watching TV or something. It doesn't sound like a very comfortable sleeping position to me. The sniffing and kissing you is a bit odd? I can definitely see how you would be bothered/awoken by that. I usually just immediately pass out so I'm not doing anything other than laying there like a log lol", "**NAH** - Long-term I'd encourage you to try out other solutions other than just sleeping in separate rooms, though getting a night or two to stabilize your sleep pattern in the spare room shouldn't be a problem. I bet Sarah is just worried you don't ever want to sleep together anymore, and going from sleeping together to separate rooms is a big change. This sounds like a growing pain of living with an SO that you should find a suitable middle-ground for.", "Good ideas. Little things like that could go a long way.", "I hope she understands this when we sit down to talk again", "Yeah when your partner is still sleeping you quietly gather what you need and leave quietly, sometimes I fall over noisily but that is a specific me issue.

This is all new to me so I thought maybe this was normal. Will bring it up surely.", "Yeah, I think I should calmly talk to her about how big of a change is this for me when she cools down", "I'm also clumsy and uncoordinated so I have to try my hardest not to bang into things in the dark. I might stub my toe on occasion, but I'd rather do that than be inconsiderate and turn on the lights waking up my partner.", "so she's only lovely when you're putting up to impossible internet standards as dictated by the viral meme of the day? because she's definitely not lovely when using you as her unfortunately-animate body pillow and disregarding your literal health.", "Oh no. I\u2019d nope right out of a relationship with someone that was comparing us to TikToks. I\u2019d expect that out of a 15yo not someone approaching 30. \n\nAlso, becoming more and more normalized for couples to sleep in separate beds or bedrooms so that they can, you know, sleep. \nYou can have sex and cuddle and still go to your bedroom and sleep. \n\nYou say she likes to sleep on top of you, but you don\u2019t like that! A good gf would understand and compromise on this. She would care about your comfort as much as yours! \n\n But immature people who think that TikTok and romcoms are what they should pattern their relationships off of are an immediate nope imo.

Some people dream of the day where they\u2019ll have a SO that they can fall asleep next to every night and wake up beside, and finding out that they won\u2019t get it can be upsetting. Same as you\u2019re not an asshole for needing more sleep and deciding to get it by sleeping separate. \n\nYou can try a sleep mask that covers your eyes and earplugs, if you want to see if that will help, but in the end you also deserve to get enough sleep to function.", "ESH - buy earplugs and sleeping mask for eyes if you dont sleep well, you should have considered those options before confroting her with changing rooms", "My girlfriend and I fight about this weekly at a minimum.  Last night I had her snoring in my ear, and less space on the bed than the length of my forearm.\n\nOf course I went to sleep elsewhere.", "NTA, BUT, she's right.  You have to get used to it.  There's nothing wrong with sleeping in the other room occasionally, but she's your significant other & if you're living together, I can only assume there may be marriage in the future.  I hated having to sleep with someone else when I first moved in with my now ex.  My mom told me I'd probably never sleep again.  But I am alone now & I sleep great!!  It's just an adjustment period.  However, you do need to make her stop waking you up when it's her time to get up.  That is just inconsiderate.  She's TA for that.", "NTA\n\nWhile this is a perfectly reasonable and workable solution, it doesn\u2019t *have* to be a permanent one. Maybe Sarah needs that reminder. Maybe a couple nights a week, y\u2019all share a bed. Maybe a bigger mattress would be helpful. Maybe earplugs or some sensory tools. Maybe you designate some \u201cbed time\u201d where you two have a good cuddle session before parting ways to sleep. Maybe it\u2019s her adjusting her bedtime earlier so she can fall asleep before you, and you can dip out to your bed. Being unconscious in the same bed doesn\u2019t define love at *all.*\n\nI do think an important factor in all of this is her consideration to you when it comes to making noise and turning on lights while you\u2019re still asleep. That is quite rude and thoughtless. I would be sure to really think about if there\u2019s any other moments where she is not being considerate to you.", "Separate bedrooms are a requirement in my relationships.

Waking you up in the morning isn't acceptable. You need a larger bed, earplugs and some consideration of the fact that you are different people with different needs.

We do our best to make sure *both* of us are getting good quality sleep. \n\nAnd if we were unable to make those accommodations work, we\u2019d absolutely sleep in separate beds.

She shouldn't demand that you just \"get used to\" her sleeping on TOP of you.\n\nThe one thing that threw me off was your line of \"I have been sleeping alone since I was 15 years old\", but that's neither here nor there in the context.", "NTA. Maybe offer a separate cuddle time or agree to go to bed together, but you slip out after a set time to go get some sleep.", "Nta. If you need to sleep in another room, you should. Waking time spent together is more important. I move to another room when I have sleep issues and my husband knows it\u2019s nothing personal.", "She'll keep getting less attractive if she continues not giving a shit about your needs to keep what she wants.\n\nNTA", "NTA - sleep patterns can be a minefield!  It requires adjustments on both sides.  I also get up earlier than my partner, but unless it's a one off like leaving for a trip and needing to get something urgently, I'll always leave clothes in the lounge and creep out trying my hardest not to wake him.  He does the same when he creeps in at night after I'm asleep.  That's pretty standard.\n\nAlso get a king size bed if you haven't, with a mattress that absorbs movement, and sleep with two separate duvets.  That solved most of our issues.\n\nPA - you can tell her from me that those TikToks are absolute bullshit.  The secret to a happy long term relationship is honest clear communication and meeting half way.", "NTA. Lots of relationships have succeeded because of separate sleeping arrangements, not in spite of.", "NTA.  Married for 36 years, slept miserably in the same bed for 25.  After enough times on vacation where we had separate beds at the hotel (which we considered to be a rare treat), and a  couple of health related incidents that sent us to separate bedrooms, we finally admitted that we were happier sleeping apart.  He's a flailer, I used to sleep like a rock, unless he fell asleep first and started flailing.  He snores, apparently I'm a cover hog.  I sometimes watch panel shows on my phone (with headphones) if I can't get to sleep, he hates the light.  We're both much happier, still love each other, and have daytime sex like we always did anyway.", "NTA. I get it. Sleep is important. And so is appreciating her. You can't appreciate her if you're cranky due to lack of sleep which she's unintentionally responsible for. I suppose you could appease her by cuddling till she falls asleep then go and sleep in the other room. But that will get old too. She doesn't have the right to get but so offended being that she snores. So do what it takes to get your sleep. She'll have to work out the way she feels about this on her own time. But don't feel guilty for this.", "NTA I have insomnia, takes hours to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep. If I wake during the night I\u2019m starting all over again. I have to take medication to have semi normal sleep schedule. My boyfriend also has trouble sleeping most nights. Sometimes he\u2019ll sleep in the guest room if he knows he\u2019ll have trouble sleeping because he knows waking me will cause me trouble sleeping. Cuddling is cute in the beginning but we\u2019ve been together 10 years, sleep is more important.", "Me and My wife sleep in separate rooms. After dinner we both cuddle and watch tv etc,. She snores a lot due to health issues and like to hold on to me in sleep. Any physical touch makes me get up.  some days I can barely get sleep. this issue went on for years. Human body needs sleep and rest  Solution is separate room.  While we are traveling I use sleep aid. For recent july 4 travel I tried no sleep aid and barely got any sleep. she snored from 11 PM to 5  AM. We do  sleep together during weekends  again with help from melotonin etc. Each person needs to be happy and healthy for a relationship to survive. not like one rule fits for  all.", "NTA", "NTA. You need sleep, and allowing a situation to continue where you\u2019re chronically under-rested will only lead to mood issues and resentments. Competing sleep needs are REALLY common, and if you have the space to sleep separately, I\u2019m not joking, it might save your relationship. \n\nIf Sarah can\u2019t or won\u2019t accept sleeping separately as a compromise, then she needs to compromise by adjusting her habits to be less disruptive for you. \n\nThe alternative to compromising is that you decide the relationship is not going to work out and go your separate ways.", "NTA. Sleep is so important. It's so weird to me that she wouldn't make an effort to let you sleep after she wakes up. Me and my husband creep around and try not to make a noise if the other person is sleeping. You could try earplugs and a sleep mask to block out the snoring and turning the lights on.", "NTA my husband and I have separated beds so we can get restful sleep.", "NTA. And if she snores like that she needs a sleep clinic study done STAT.", "I often sleep in the spare bedroom, especially when my wife is snoring or has to wake up early. Neither of us are offended, we love sleep LOL", "NTA but your gf is.  \"She also no concern for my sleep as she wakes up before me and either switches on lights or makes noises.\" That's rude and inconsiderate. She needs to grow tf up and start showing some maturity if she wants a lasting relationship", "NTA, when I\u2019m being annoying in my sleep my bf just goes to the guest room. He usually goes to bed later than me so he\u2019ll come snuggle me til I\u2019m asleep and then either stay up or go to bed. Maybe that\u2019s a compromise?", "NTA.\n\nI've been married for 17 years, and sleep in my own bed. I have misophonia, and she snores. She understands.", "Buy a split mattress to solve the bed stealing.\n\nTry to work with her on being more discreet waking up in the morning.", "NTA.  She obviously doesn't care that you're not getting any sleep as long as she's getting what she wants.", "NTA. I love my husband dearly but we had to get twin beds. He sleeps with weighted blankets,  has restless leg syndrome  and wants to snuggle. I sleep like Sheldon on Big Bang Theory with light covers.  I love DH  but don't want him touching me while I sleep..Hence twin beds. Sleep is important. How you sleep has nothing to do with how much you love someone . Everyone has different sleep needs. Did Sarah not sleep by herself before you came along?", "Maybe you can compromise and on nights you work, sleep separate so you get a good sleep, and on nights where you\u2019re off the next day, sleep with her? You can always take a nap if needed. Hopefully she won\u2019t feel bad about herself then, and maybe you\u2019ll get used to sleeping with her and can go back to doing it full time!", "NTA:\n\nWe have been married for a year and I snore so loudly. My wife wouldnt get any sleep if I slept in the same room as her. Besides being considerate for the other person by not turning on the light or being aware of not making noise in the morning makes her TA", "NTA she can cuddle a pillow with an unwashed a tee shirt that belongs to you.", "It's the \"I should get used to it\" specifically that bothers me. Lack of sleep isn't something you just get used to, that's why fucking with someone's sleep can be considered torture. It fucks you up in the long term. She should be more concerned about your needs instead of focusing on her wants.", "NTA.  She sounds (based on what you've shared) like only she deserves to live how she likes and you need to get in line/conform.  OF COURSE she believes sleeping together works because it's conducive for HER and that's all that counts (apparently).  I hope that you two can work things out but I'd really advise you not to bend yourself into a pretzel to where you are just giving in without any consideration for your health on her part.", "Adjusting to sleeping next to someone is difficult and does take time. My husband snores, and I mean SNORES. Most of the time, I can drown it out or get him to roll on his side from his back. \n\nOnce in a blue moon, I sleep in our guest room because I just can\u2019t take it and he will wake up and know exactly why I am where I am. Personally, I would be heartbroken if one of us decided to sleep in another room permanently but to each their own. \n\nI\u2019m going NAH. Every couple is different and finds their own way of doing things.", "Same.  Married going on 25 years, and sleeping separately is one of the best things we\u2019ve done for our marriage and personal health.  NTA, OP.", "Yeah, we agreed years ago they being rested and not hating each other in the middle of the night was actually more romantic than cuddling. Good choice for us!", "This is like, the most basic human need. If OP keeps sleeping 4-5 hours a night, they are *not* going to have a good time health-wise. If they feel the relationship with Sarah is worth saving, can there be a compromise? Maybe OP and Sarah sleep separately but have a particular night of the week where they sleep together, so OP can get good rest during the week and Sarah can have her night to cuddle. \n\nI'm a fan of occasional co-sleeping, but it took me a long time to acclimate and if I had to co-sleep every single night of the week I would probably not have the greatest time.", "exactly.", "Yes and also she needs to be more considerate of him sleeping when she wakes up before then. If someone turned on a light when I still had a few hours left to go I would see RED", " I think that's totally fair and I respect that. Though we do still sleep next to each other just not holding each other.", "Tbh I think the girlfriend is TA. It\u2019s okay to feel hurt because clearly she has her personally beliefs about sleeping together. However, she also dismissed his concerns and made it about her", "Yeah I lean a little more towards her being the AH because of her reaction, but they may just not be compatible in this way. Plenty of couple thrive while sleeping separately, but that may not be the kind of environment she needs and that's not her fault either. If she won't discuss other compromises to help them both be healthy and happy then I don't see this working out long term.", "But she's not selfish by interrupting your sleep in very rude ways (aka lights on etc) and ultimately cutting it short? She \"feels\" lonely sleeping alone but you NEED sleep. So her wants are more important than your needs? She makes you doubt yourself by hurling unfounded accusations that you no longer find her attractive. That's called manipulation. Then your other comment about she's a pain in the ass unless you live up to TikTok boyfriend standards.\n\nSo to recap: she is being selfish, puts her wants above your needs, uses manipulation to get her way and holds you to unattainable and unrealistic internet boyfriend standards.\n\nShe sounds immature AF. That is a whole load of red flags. Run, bruh!\n\nNTA.", "\u201cSarah believes I am being selfish not taking into account that she would feel lonely sleeping alone and that is making me doubt myself\u201d\n\nUh, and she\u2019s not being selfish by demanding you give up literally half of the sleep you need, just so she\u2019s not \u201clonely\u201d? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Is she offering to change some of the things that disrupt your sleep to see if that helps?

NTA at all.", "In reality, she's being selfish - she would rather you **not sleep** than sleep without her.", "Get her a body pillow.", "feeling lonely is not the same as keeping someone awake and not letting them get a decent night's sleep.  NTA.", "She's being equally as selfish by keeping you up and telling you to just power through it and give her what she wants. \n\nIsn't funny how selfish always recognizes selfish?", "She's also being selfish not taking your emotions/feelings/lack of sleep into consideration OP. Keep an eye out for that early in a relationship where you live together. Good luck!", "Whats selfish is putting her desire to sleep with you (what tf difference does it even matter to her when she's literally sleeping) over you getting a decent amount of sleep. Ask her to sleep for a week for 4 hours and then she'll get it.", "I don\u2019t think this is a right or wrong situation. You would like to sleepy separately because she interrupts your sleep, which is valid. She wants to sleep in the same bed as her partner, which is valid. The issue may just be you\u2019re not compatible. And I\u2019m not saying break up but neither of you are the AH for wanting to be comfortable in your relationship, just might not be the right relationship", "She's being selfish by not taking into account that you are not sleeping.", "Bollocks!", "Yup. I always wake up before my husband, so the night before I lay out my clothes and whatever else I need so I can grab it and get dressed in the bathroom. Thoughtfulness in a relationship makes all the difference.", "Her TikTok feed sounds toxic af. There are lovely women out there who will not feel the need to use an app as a measuring stick for their relationship.

This situation demonstrates that she is neither wonderful nor caring. (It\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt)\n\nComparing your relationship to social media depictions of relationships should also prompt you to reflect on her critical thinking skills, emotional intelligence, and empathy. How would she feel if you compared her to social media influencers? \n\nEmpathy, emotional intelligence, and intrinsic inclination toward prosocial behaviors are essential for healthy long-term relationships, romantic or otherwise.", "Um... that's painfully immature. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship and she is setting you both up for a lot of disappointment and frustration. If she wants to live in the real world with you, she will need to face some tough truths. This will decide if you two move forward or not. The less sleep you get, the less love you'll actually feel for her.", "Jesus she's really 29 entire years old and believes that what people post on TikTok is an actual reflection of reality? Every one of those posts is a lie made up to get views and engagement.\n\nThis is the behavior of someone 10 years younger and it's concerning.", "As the person in the relationship who comes to bed late, rocks my head, and snores I can tell you that nobody needs to put up with us poor sleepers.  The master bedroom is for her to sleep in and sexy time.  Sleep time I go off to the office/monster bedroom.", "That's understandable, given that you are sleep deprived and she is deliberately making it worse.    I would not do that to my worst enemy", "For the snoring I'd give nose strips a try. That kept my ex quiet enough where I Was able to fall asleep first. They always came off in the night and ended up stuck to one of his. Hilarious/weird.", "You might also consider wearing earplugs and an eye mask to sleep. Has made my life a lot easier.", "thay's super dangerous to start yr day with 4/5 h sleep ! do you drive a car ?", "Can confirm, King Beds are great. I'm huge, my wife isn't small, and there's still room to comfortably fit 3 cats and a german shepherd on the bed while we sleep!", "NTA. This is huge for me too. My husband is a very light sleeper. He can\u2019t sleep if we\u2019re touching, so I don\u2019t. If I have to get up before him, I  leave my clothes outside the door the night before so in the morning I can get up quietly and get dressed in the bathroom without disturbing him.  I use a vibrating wristwatch alarm. I never turn on the light if he\u2019s asleep. None of this is difficult to do. Your girlfriend needs some elementary lessons in consideration for a partner. But also, your sleep takes priority, because it\u2019s essential to your health, and if you need to spend a little while cuddling her and then go off to your own room to sleep, there is no reason you shouldn\u2019t.", "Another vote for the king size bed - my husband is very tall so in a regular bed he has to scrunch up and that takes up even more space. No more knees in the back in a king size bed!", "No, not equally selfish. She's being far *more* selfish. Not just because all-day sleep deprivation is a much bigger problem than a few hours of loneliness per day. But also because people are not entitled to companions. They *are* entitled to their basic life necessities like sleep.", "Is there a part you think she doesn't understand?", "Please mention to her that sleep deprivation is a method of torture. I'm curious to know why it's more important to her to match some BS tiktok ideal than it is to refrain from literally torturing you.", "Sleep deprivation is torture.  I don't mean that figurtively - it's classified as torture.  You can't sleep deprive prisoners and still call yourself a civilized society.\n\nIf she were my GF, she would get with the program real fast or she would be complaining about her loneliness to her next SO.  I have no effs to give for people who want to offload their negative feelings onto me by putting me through a war crime.", "That \"aside\" is doing a LOT of work here.  \n\n\nNTA BTW", "A lovely woman who does not care that you are lacking sleep, will not be careful not to wake you up and takes it as a personal insult that you find another means?
