The relationship has been going great and I love how amazing she is but lately I have been tired.\n\nWe decided to move in a new apartment 2 months ago and I also took a new job. The new job has been a bit stressful compared to my last job. Luckily I am still getting time for my personal hobbies like gym and going out with Sarah.\n\nNow the problem I want to talk about is my lack of sleep. I have been sleeping alone since I was 15 years old and now sleeping with someone else is kinda bothering to me. I am used to the peace of sleeping alone.\n\nMy girlfriend likes to sleep with a low fan sleep, takes up too much space in bed ans most importantly she snores sometimes which ruins my sleep completely. She also no concern for my sleep as she wakes up before me and either switches on lights or makes noises. I am used to sleeping 7-8 hours a day but for the past few months I have been sleeping only 4-5 hours because of this.\n\nSo finally I got frustrated and confronted her about this. I know my girlfriend can't change in a day so I proposed I will just sleep in the other room peacefully.\n\nShe got upset and was furious about this suggestion. She believes sleeping together is a sign of love between a couple and that she likes cuddling or sleeping on top of me and says I should get used to it.\n\nShe now thinks that I don't find her attractive but that isn't true at all.

Can she prep her clothing night before and get dressed in other room?   The bed hogging you may need to fight for that, as in push her away onto her side of the bed.

Sleeping in the same bed is not a requirement of any relationship. If it's important to her and you're willing to try again, tell her you need an adjustment period to acclimate yourself to sleeping together. It's the same concept as quitting an addiction or habit; going cold turkey can make things a lot harder for people and sometimes it's best to ease into the change.

Sure, she is allowed to want to sleep with her partner, but IMO she doesn't have a right to be upset at you when it is literally HER OWN FAULT that you're so sleep deprived.\n\nSleep deprivation is literally a form of torture.

Like, I'm sorry, but the minute she chose to act like you're wrong for not wanting to share a bed with her, she became the AH.\n\nI also like sleeping with my partner most nights.. but I also go out of my way to ensure I'm not waking him up. If she wants to share a bed with you, she needs to accept that she is being massively disruptive.

Maybe you can come to a compromise and split it every other day you guys sleep together?

As everyone else mentioned, co sleeping can be super healthy and it\u2019s definitely not unreasonable of you to want this.

Since it takes time, sometimes it makes sense to maintain your independence in an area while you work out what the best \"protocol\" will be for doing something together. It's totally valid that if right now you can't figure out a way to both get a good night sleep, that in the short term you both do what works for you independently while in the long term you work on a strategy for being able to sleep together happily. Sleep deprivation is emotionally and physically damaging and will cause a lot of resentment. You can't just accept that as a fact of the relationship. You need to have a way to sleep.\n\nShe is in control over whether you sleep in the other room because the reasons you're saying you are doing it are things she can address (and none of them have to do with the reason she's replacing them with about attractiveness). She needs to learn to hear her partner and to put her energy into fixing the problem. If she wants you to sleep in the same room, she can put her energy into addressing the reasons you provided for not being able to sleep in the same room. Instead, she's ignoring those reasons.\n\nI have been in your position... a partner that snored, liked noise to sleep, took up too much of the bed, being on very different sleep schedules, etc. Once we no longer lived in a one room apartment, we made the rule that the sleeping person always gets priority of the bedroom. So, if your gf wants to wake up early, it's on her to go to a different room to be light and loud. We got a bigger bed. She went for a sleep study and now has a CPAP instead of snoring (and she gets a better night sleep as a result!) Before then, she told me to always feel comfortable waking her if she was snoring too loud..sometimes I'd do that and other times I'd just sleep somewhere else for the rest of the night. For the noise that she needs, she started using headphones and small phone or tablet that only she could see. We also got a sound machine and that helps drown out the noise so that she can even sometimes put her speakers on very likely without bothering me.\n\nThe theme of all of this is that we listen to each other's needs and we tried to come up with things to do in response. The way we sleep now is enormously different from the way we did when we first met. You don't succeed in a long term relationship if you just want to be a the same person doing the same thing and insist that somebody else does that thing with you. (i.e. what your gf is doing). You succeed by recognizing what areas your guys conflict with each other and then either learning a new strategy so that you're no longer in conflict (i.e. changing your sleep routines/rules) or choosing your battles (i.e. sleeping apart for a bit).", "NTA- sometimes sleep styles are too different. I love my husband, but he wants to fall asleep to the TV and I want quiet or rain sounds. He comes to bed hours later than I do, and once he falls asleep he snores like a lumberjack sawing logs. We definitely had separate spaces for a while, when we had enough space that we could each have a bedroom, and it helped our relationship because I wasn't a cranky tired jerk all the time.", "NTA. My hubby and I (together for 18 years) sometimes sleep seperate for various reasons. \n\nOne of them is that i snore (not sometimes, pretty much every night and loud, seriously), if it bothers him too much, he moves to the guestroom, so he doesnt have to keep shoving me until i stop \ud83d\ude06 \nSometimes, especially after a rough night for him, i go sleep in the guestroom the next night, so he can get a full nights sleep.\n\nSometimes one of us stays up later, then that person will sleep in the guestroom, as to not disturb the one already sleeping.\n\nSure we love cuddling and i love sleeping together, but sometimes, sleep is more important. Lack of sleep results in grumpyness, no energy, apathy, etc which is NOT the partner one wants to be.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. She\u2019s being selfish. You\u2019re being sleep deprived is more important than her feeling lonely while she\u2019s sleeping.", "NTA everyone deserves good sleep. And it's incredibly disrespectful for her to make a ruckus just because she wakes up first. She just sounds immature. I'm not sure if you've had a conversation breaking down each individual problem and suggesting solutions. Like no lights when she first wakes up so you can sleep longer for example. But if you have and she's not willing to make accommodations, then I'd say y'all are not compatible.", "I\u2019m all about the separate bedrooms. This should be normalized in relationships. I slept next to someone for over sixteen years before that ran a fan on high, snored like a freight train, came to bed late and woke me up, slept through his alarm multiple times a day, and blew the stench of Marlboro reds and rum in my general direction. Smothering with a pillow was unfortunately not and option, so the spare room it was.", "This could be a dealbreaker. I'm reading so many couples below sleep apart and it's the key to their happiness. Sleeping in bed with my husband is one of my favorite parts of being married. I hate sleeping alone. I hate when we're apart one night. I don't know if I could be as happy with him if we didn't both loving sharing a bed. But you are also totally allowed to want to sleep alone!!! But it's also fair for her to not accept it. She cannot force you, but you both have to remember you are talking about sleeping arrangements for the rest of your lives, so it's not something to take lightly.", "NTA\n\nBeing able to understand the benefits of separate rooms is a game changer. I snore and sleep easier than my wife. I\u2019m sure our relationship wouldn\u2019t have lasted if we were forced to always sleep in the same bed", "NTA.\n\nThis is important to your health and also relationship. If you carry on like this, you will just start to resent her", "NTA. The big thing here is that relationships are built on compromise.  You need to sleep alone to get a good night's rest.  She feels that part of a healthy relationship is sleeping together.  Is there any way you can sit down and figure out some way they you both get what you want?  Maybe sleeping together on certain nights?  Changing certain habits when you are sleeping together/apart?", "NTA I am going through the exact same thing with my gf. Can't sleep for shit with another human, love her to bits.", "Sarah believes I am being selfish not taking into account that she would feel lonely sleeping alone and that is making me doubt myself", "I would try to work with her on what you need to get good rest. She has to respect that if she respects you.", "Thank you. She is wonderful and caring person but kinda acts a bit immature when it comes to these things. She scrolls TikTok a lot and there are many \"perfect relationship\" videos on her feed which she even shows me. I think that is part of why she is holding on this idea", "I think I should communicate this to Sarah , thank you for this", "I tried explaining her this but she just thinks I am being selfish", "Yup surely I will talk about the compromise.\n\nAlso may I ask since you are into this, do you cuddle daily and does it bother you or your boyfriend sometimes? My girlfriend on most days wants me to sleep without a t-shirt and  then sleeps on top of me with her head on my chest and then sniffs me and keeps kissing me. \n\nI find it lovely but sometimes I don't like her body weight on me whilesleeping or sleeping without a tshirt. I don't know how to bring it up that her lovemaking is little uncomfortable at times", "Sorry a typo , *3 years", "Yup we do that a lot. The first thing I do after waking up and having a bath so go hug her in the kitchen for around 3-4 mins. Intimacy is very important for us. Maybe thats why she doesn't want to sleep alone", "Maybe a nightlight? Can she prep her clothing night before and get dressed in other room?", "Whay you read is true. 7-8 hours of healthy sleep can literally solve 70% of my your problems", "I said 'confronted' because I have mentioned these things to her earlier but she has just ignored or forgot about it.", "Yup someone else also suggested a compromise of sleeping together and apart for a few days. I am going to talk to her about this in a calm manner maybe my tone was a bit confrontational when I told her this.", "But what compromises is she willing to make to help you sleep as well? She refuses to work on any of the things she does that are preventing you from sleeping and calls you selfish for not wanting to be sleep deprived to keep her from feeling lonely while she's sleeping.", "Dude, she's being super selfish and has no consideration for you and your needs. Turning the light on when your partner is still sleeping is selfish and inconsiderate as fuck. Trying to cuddle or sleep on top of someone who likes space when they're sleeping is selfish. Taking up more than your fair share of the bed is selfish if done on purpose. \n\nI get that you don't want to make her feel lonely, but only sleeping 4-5 hours a night is terrible for your health. It will eventually take a major toll on you and your mood and thus also possibly start to negatively affect your relationship.", "Idk mate, that sounds like a maturity problem on her part. \ud83e\udee0", "She was fine sleeping alone before you moved in together lol.", "How about her selfishness of not caring about your sleep??", "Not for Sarah, because she sounds incredibly selfish and manipulative, but in the future, a king sized bed will do wonders for your sleep. It\u2019s like sleeping alone. But you can still cuddle as you\u2019re falling asleep. It\u2019s heaven. \n\nSleep compatibility is real. You cannot sacrifice sleep.\n\nETA: the fact that she turns on the lights and doesn\u2019t try to be quiet while you\u2019re sleeping is a big red flag for me. A loving partner cares about your well-being and sleep is a prerequisite for wellbeing/sanity/daily functionality.", "> when it comes to these things\n\nLike your well being?  I'm sorry but based on what you said in your post, she is not a caring person, she's selfish.", "She has no respect for your sleeping well being and she thinks YOU'RE being selfish?  Total BS.", "Communication is definitely very important.\n\nI have never been bothered by him, although sometimes he gets hot as the AC in our home isn't the best and he doesn't want to cuddle on the nights when its super hot. I think that's totally fair and I respect that. Though we do still sleep next to each other just not holding each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend takes his shirt off anyways so I'm not too sure about that, but I wouldn't care whether he slept with or without a shirt. I usually keep my shirt on while sleeping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the sleeping on top of you definitely sounds uncomfortable, I generally sleep next to him and he has his arms around me, I don't sleep on top of him. When I do its usually in the day while we're watching TV or something. It doesn't sound like a very comfortable sleeping position to me. The sniffing and kissing you is a bit odd? I can definitely see how you would be bothered/awoken by that. I usually just immediately pass out so I'm not doing anything other than laying there like a log lol", "**NAH** - Long-term I'd encourage you to try out other solutions other than just sleeping in separate rooms, though getting a night or two to stabilize your sleep pattern in the spare room shouldn't be a problem. I bet Sarah is just worried you don't ever want to sleep together anymore, and going from sleeping together to separate rooms is a big change. This sounds like a growing pain of living with an SO that you should find a suitable middle-ground for.", "Good ideas. Little things like that could go a long way.", "I hope she understands this when we sit down to talk again", "Yeah when your partner is still sleeping you quietly gather what you need and leave quietly, sometimes I fall over noisily but that is a specific me issue.

This is all new to me so I thought maybe this was normal. Will bring it up surely.", "Yeah, I think I should calmly talk to her about how big of a change is this for me when she cools down", "I'm also clumsy and uncoordinated so I have to try my hardest not to bang into things in the dark. I might stub my toe on occasion, but I'd rather do that than be inconsiderate and turn on the lights waking up my partner.", "so she's only lovely when you're putting up to impossible internet standards as dictated by the viral meme of the day? because she's definitely not lovely when using you as her unfortunately-animate body pillow and disregarding your literal health.", "Oh no. I\u2019d nope right out of a relationship with someone that was comparing us to TikToks. I\u2019d expect that out of a 15yo not someone approaching 30. \n\nAlso, becoming more and more normalized for couples to sleep in separate beds or bedrooms so that they can, you know, sleep. \nYou can have sex and cuddle and still go to your bedroom and sleep. \n\nYou say she likes to sleep on top of you, but you don\u2019t like that! A good gf would understand and compromise on this. She would care about your comfort as much as yours! \n\n But immature people who think that TikTok and romcoms are what they should pattern their relationships off of are an immediate nope imo.

Some people dream of the day where they\u2019ll have a SO that they can fall asleep next to every night and wake up beside, and finding out that they won\u2019t get it can be upsetting. Same as you\u2019re not an asshole for needing more sleep and deciding to get it by sleeping separate. \n\nYou can try a sleep mask that covers your eyes and earplugs, if you want to see if that will help, but in the end you also deserve to get enough sleep to function.", "ESH - buy earplugs and sleeping mask for eyes if you dont sleep well, you should have considered those options before confroting her with changing rooms", "My girlfriend and I fight about this weekly at a minimum.  Last night I had her snoring in my ear, and less space on the bed than the length of my forearm.\n\nOf course I went to sleep elsewhere.", "NTA, BUT, she's right.  You have to get used to it.  There's nothing wrong with sleeping in the other room occasionally, but she's your significant other & if you're living together, I can only assume there may be marriage in the future.  I hated having to sleep with someone else when I first moved in with my now ex.  My mom told me I'd probably never sleep again.  But I am alone now & I sleep great!!  It's just an adjustment period.  However, you do need to make her stop waking you up when it's her time to get up.  That is just inconsiderate.  She's TA for that.", "NTA\n\nWhile this is a perfectly reasonable and workable solution, it doesn\u2019t *have* to be a permanent one. Maybe Sarah needs that reminder. Maybe a couple nights a week, y\u2019all share a bed. Maybe a bigger mattress would be helpful. Maybe earplugs or some sensory tools. Maybe you designate some \u201cbed time\u201d where you two have a good cuddle session before parting ways to sleep. Maybe it\u2019s her adjusting her bedtime earlier so she can fall asleep before you, and you can dip out to your bed. Being unconscious in the same bed doesn\u2019t define love at *all.*\n\nI do think an important factor in all of this is her consideration to you when it comes to making noise and turning on lights while you\u2019re still asleep. That is quite rude and thoughtless. I would be sure to really think about if there\u2019s any other moments where she is not being considerate to you.", "Separate bedrooms are a requirement in my relationships.

We do our best to make sure *both* of us are getting good quality sleep. \n\nAnd if we were unable to make those accommodations work, we\u2019d absolutely sleep in separate beds.

Do you think a bigger one would help?", "NTA. I currently share a bedroom with my partner, but I might not the rest of the week due to our non aligning sleep patterns right now. I can do a day or two of less than optimal sleep, but then I need my optimal sleep 7-9 hrs or I will be a huge A to everyone and tired and work poorly. \n\nMy partner snores, they have sleep apnea and a cpap machine. They don't use the CPAP machine enough, so the snoring wakes me up and keeps me up. The CPAP isn't quiet, but it's steady.", "Might want to tell her that there are couples out there that sleep in separate rooms and are totally fine.", "All I hear from her is me,me,me oh and me she isn't taking into account your feelings at all if she cant even think about you when it comes to the small things think about what's gonna happen later down the line when you two encounter bigger problems", "NTA- Sleep is so important for your physical and mental well-being.

Upgrading to separate bedrooms may have saved us.  I\u2019m a light sleeper with occasional insomnia.  My health requires it.  So I feel you. Also- for intimacy I find it to be great too! If we are in bed together, it\u2019s a conscious choice.  Sleepovers become special instead of automatic.  I think it keeps things fresh.  For me, sleeping together was even creating some resentment, as the snoring was also a factor.  Unrequested advice from a happy wife, see if you can invite her to be on your side in tackling this problem together.  You\u2019re a team, your problems are shared, figure out your collective core needs and ways to create that in your lives.  If you can tackle the hurdles you experience as a team, it makes everything infinitely easier. I believe in yall! NAH", "NTA \nThe night before last husband slept in the guest room.

He is, I'll say, very active in his sleep and I would often wake up to hit smacking me, arma flailing, kicking me, etc. \n\nAlso, he used to snore like a moose with a chainsaw. He recently quit smoking AND drinking soda and like magic, he stopped snoring. \n\nSleeping together is NOT a sign of love. Caring about each other IS.", "I have been with my partner nearly 40 years. We have our own bedrooms. I am a restless sleeper and I snore, while he is a very light sleeper. We are very close and affectionate with each other.", "Get a bigger bed, soft silicone ear plugs. Sleeping in a different room isn't the answer, and of course she might be offended. NAH.", "Both of y\u2019all are the AH.

I think you could have given her a chance to try.\n\nMe and SO struggled with sleep problems.

Had I decided to just take the other room, we couldn\u2019t have worked it out together.\n\nThat said, I understand you need your sleep.  My issue specifically is with the way you handled the situation.  Your girlfriend literally has no reason to adjust to your sleep needs if you are no longer sharing a bed.  Therefore, she may continue with how she was doing things.  So you will be able to say, \u201csee, I knew you wouldn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nI just think you did a pretty shitty thing.

As many others, myself included, might say, it's important for them to feel that sense of intimacy that comes from sleeping with their partner.  You can both try to talk it out and work with a compromise or, perhaps, this will be the issue that breaks you up.  But this isn't an AITA question because it doesn't matter.
