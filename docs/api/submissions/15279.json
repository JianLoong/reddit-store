{"id": 15279, "submission_id": "12tcf7s", "title": "AITA for not bringing my wife with me on a holiday I won?", "selftext": "A few weeks ago, I (28M) won an all-inclusive couple's holiday to Greece at a charity fundraiser event. I was thrilled, as it's somewhere I've always wanted to visit. I told my wife that I won, and she was also very glad and told me she couldn't wait to come along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing: me and my wife (27F) are pretty much polar opposites when it comes to travel. She likes to plan out a full schedule, wake up early, do loads of sight-seeing, walk around all day in the city and come back to the hotel exhausted. I, on the other hand, enjoy being a bit lazy, waking up late, spending time in caf\u00e9s reading books, and going for massages in the hotel. We've tried to come up with compromise solutions in the past, but it hasn't really worked. She gets very restless staying put in the hotel with me even for a single day (and complains about it constantly), and if I tell her to go by herself she tells me she'll be lonely or doesn't feel safe travelling alone. In the past, I've always ended up giving in and going with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently though, I've had a stressful couple months at work and I'm craving an opportunity to completely decompress without any schedule to stick to. So that was my plan for this trip. I thought for a long time about whether or not I wanted to bring my wife along, and in the end I decided I'd rather go alone. I didn't want to run the risk of having her complain all day even if she promised to do things in a more relaxed way, nor did I want to run the risk of being dragged unwillingly to museums etc by her. It took me about a week to decide this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo once I'd decided, I sat down and tried to broach the matter as sensitively as I could. My wife was FURIOUS. She'd had to pull in some favours to get time off work for the trip, and was completely outraged that I hadn't told her this sooner. In my defence, I didn't know she was going to so much trouble. If I'd known I would've told her about my hesitance. I didn't tell her as soon as I won the tickets because I wanted to avoid an unnecessary fight. She told me I'd be sorry if I didn't let her come, and then she basically accused me of cheating, saying that it was a couple's vacation and the only reason I wouldn't want to go with her was if I were planning to bring somebody else along, and that she didn't buy any of the reasons I gave above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings were a little cold between us for the subsequent days but I thought she'd managed to get over it by the time the date for the trip rolled around. I carried through with my plan of going alone and I had a fantastic time. I got back three days ago, only to find that she, and all her stuff, were completely gone. She left a letter on the counter calling me all manner of horrible things, including an AH. I know I haven't been an angel over this, but I don't think her reaction is reasonable. I want to try and get her back because I love her, but I need to know where I stand.

Dunno what would have happened if we had failed them but while we aren't perfectly aligned, we found a good grove that has served us well for the past 15 years and god knows how many trips together that we both enjoy immensely.\n\nI honestly just can't imagine marrying someone who I literally *don't want to go on an awesome vacation trip with.*\n\nSo like... I very much *want* to say YTA (and massively so), but given that you two apparently married in spite of this and I presume knowing you don't travel well together, I am at least curious how you have navigated this issue up to now...", "YTA.\n\nYou could have worked out a compromise, she could have joined late or left early to accomodate your requirement for alone time.  But instead you valued your wants above your marriage you reaped what you sowed.  You wanted to be alone on a couples vacation, so now she has given you what you want, a marriage with all the alone time you could ever want.\n\nThere has to be more to the story for you to take a once in a lifetime free travel opportunity for COUPLES and decree that only you would travel & enjoy this.  There has to be something more than you & your soon to be ex-wife having different travel styles.  Maybe you didnt use the other ticket or take someone with you.   Maybe someone was meeting you there, maybe you planned to spend time w other women, even if you didnt take anyone or meet a particular person.  \n\n It is simply inconceivable that you chose to disregard your wife's feelings, jeopardize your marriage, and go on a solo vacation without there being much more to the story.  \nDid you even consider the potential blowback from your selfish choice and how it would impact your soon to be ex-wife and how it would impact your relationship and marriage?", "YTA\n\nIf you truly valued your marriage more than some stupid trip, you would have compromised. You would have spent the odd days vacationing your wife's way, with excursions throughout the city, seeing everything you could from sunup to sunset, and the even days vacationing your way, getting up late, reading a book in a cafe you discovered together, strolling through the city together, relaxing. \n\nIt's called compromise. \n\nInstead, your actions informed her that you'd prefer to be a single guy.", "YTA. You didn't even have the guts to communicate your intentions with her? Eek. Marriage involves compromise; if you can't do, you shouldn't be married. Your attitude of 'my trip' isn't in the spirit of this.\n\nI think you may need to accept that it's over. I don't know many women who'd tolerate this bs - fair play to her.", "YTA. You wanted to be alone so badly now you are. What is the problem?", "YTA. \n\nLine one: \u201call-inclusive COUPLE\u2019S holiday\u201d.", "YTA. And also now single. I have a hard time believing you love your soon-to-be ex-wife. Let her go and find someone who loves and cares about her. You should wise up so your next marriage doesn\u2019t also end in divorce.", "YTA.\n\nHave fun getting divorced my dude.", "Uh -huh. You wanted to go to Greece and leave your wife  at home  because  she's a bad travel partner.  No other reason. Nope. I totally  buy that and by that, I mean I don't.   You're at fault.", "YTA. And I\u2019m glad your wife left and didn\u2019t put up with your behavior.", "Fuck around and found out, YTA", "YTA.\n\nHave fun being alone with all the down time in the world lol.\n\nImagine having a life partner and leaving them behind in a trip like this without even telling them sooner.", "LMFAO. You fucked around and found out dude. \n\nYTA.", "\"Id rather let this ticket expire than to take you along.\"\n\nThis is a blow in the face from a SO that lets you suffer alot. It says \"I don't like you and don't want you to be around me\" in huge letters. And people tend to return these kind of emotional injuries. Even if the truth is more complex.\n\nIf your lifestyles are incompatible its ok to do stuff separatly but this requires excellent communication and trust which you guys clearly don't have.\n\nYou fucked up big time, even if your wish for peace is totally legitimate, so don't even try to argue in your favour if you want her back.", "YTA. If you loved your wife, you would have TALKED to her and COMPROMISED. I honestly don't think there is any \"getting her back\" and I hope she gets enough money in the divorce to take a nice trip and have a fantastic time without you.", "YTA. Make clear you don\u2019t want her to micromanage the trip but FFS don\u2019t leave her behind.", "YTA. My wife and I don't make great travel partners either for very similar reasons. But I couldn't imagine doing this to her. This is the ultimate in selfishness.", "YTA. So you'd be fine if your wife won the holiday and didn't take you?", "YTA. You are such a huge AH and don't even realize it... On what planet did you think you would get away with going on an amazing and free holiday by yourself?! Is your wife not also deserving of a fun trip?! The fact that you would rather be selfish and not include her speaks volumes about your marriage.\n\nIf you don't like her style of traveling, build down time into the plan. Compromise and plan things out in advance and then you both know what to expect each day.", "I mean honestly what did you expect? \n\nYou would rather just leave your wife at home than to compromise even a little bit? That is a shocking amount of selfishness. Of course it was a hard topic to breach, because you really have zero justification to stand on. Plus you knew she was expecting to come and waited till the last minute to pull the rug from under her.\n\nYTA majorly.", "YTA\n\nhope you have money saved up for your divorce", "I find it hard to believe this is real. Noone is that stupid...", "YTA.. She's supposed to be your best friend and a part of marriage is to compromise. You won a bucket-list trip and tossed your best friend / life partner to the side. What do you think would happen?\n\nDude, my wife loves being ocean side at a beach somewhere, anywhere. I hate beaches, hate them with a passion. But you bet your ass we go on vacation and spend a couple days at the beach. Why? Because it makes her happy. There's nothing that puts a smile on my face and a warm fuzzy than to see her happy and enjoying herself. You sacrifice for each other.", "YTA. Your solution would have been COMMUNICATION.\n\nYou should have told her you needed to decompress, you should have told her how her complaining makes you feel, you should have worked through ways to make everyone get out of it what they needed. That's a partnership.\n\nYou made the decision for both of you and it was a deal breaking bad one. Is it really weird she matched your energy and made the next decision for you both?", "YTA - go on the holiday by yourself, but don't be surprised if you don't have a wife when you get back.\n\nMarriage is about compromise. Get over yourself.", "YTA. You're also a complete idiot if you honestly thought you'd still have a wife when you got back.", "Well she did tell you, you would be sorry if you did not let her come. YTA\n\nCant believe you thought it was ok to not have your wife come on vacation.. yeah she will find someone who will gladly take her on vacation now", "YTA.  So you knew she expected to go from the beginning but didn't make that clear from then?   You tried to avoid an 'unnecessary' fight (which was going to come no matter what, so it's necessary).  How long did you let her believe she was going? A week, you say?  You are trying to say you didn't know this was going to be so much trouble?  Um... I don't actually believe that.  I think you were just so invested in not having the unavoidable fight that you made things so much worse.  \n\nYou want to try and get her back, because you love her?  Good luck with that.  Sounds like she is gone.  The separation paperwork is probably already in the pipeline.", "Yeah YTA. Telling your wife that you don't want to go on a couple's holiday with her doesnt scream I love you tbh. But hey, as long as you had a fantastic time without your wife it's all good right? Hope it was worth losing your marriage over", "And...POoooF! Now you ll travel all alone all the time! Well done!\n\nYTA.", "INFO what did you do while you were in Greece?  What did she say in the letter?  Have you done something similar in the past because these seems like this may have been the straw that broke the camel's back?", "Let me put this for you in a way that you'll understand : you're gonna use your hand A LOT!!!", "I don't know about you but that is a once in a lifetime vacation.  You could have just said, \"Hey, when we are there I would like to relax while you do stuff.\nBut you just dropped her.\nLike flat out?, I would rather have this all inclusive vacation without you dropped her. \nYou can't come back from that.  How do you.  You either don't give a shit about her or were cheating on her.  Why would she come back?\nBuy her and a friend of her choice a really nice all inclusive exotic vacation package, no strings. and when she gets back ask her if she will reconcile.   Don't ask to go with her though.", "YTA you are definitely wrong on this one. Make a plan for both of you to have fun, but to just tell her no? YTA", "YTA. if i had a partner and he did this oh boy i would react like your wife. you made it clear you rather be alone then compromise with your wife so you both could enjoy the trip. \n\ngoodluck fixing this marriage. you messed up badly", "YTA. Ain\u2019t no coming back from this my friend.", "YTA.\nI can understand why she would feel like you\u2019re a cheater. If it was a solo trip that you planned, I would have given you the benefit of the doubt. However, it is a couple\u2019s holiday, and you happen to not want to take your wife for that specific trip? It doesn\u2019t make sense at all, especially since we don\u2019t even know what happened to the other ticket.", "YTA - I don\u2019t know how you can write this and need to ask tbh. You wanted to be on holiday as a single man and now you got it permanently.", "Though I highly doubt this actually happened it was still a very entertaining story-- and had it been a true story yes YTA", "Her leaving you was the most likely consequence of your decision to go alone. How is it possible that you didn't anticipate that? But hey, at least you are well rested for the divorce process!", "INFO: Was the trip worth your marriage?", "YTA. Your next post: \"Why did my wife leave me?\"", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s your WIFE. If you don\u2019t want to go to a freaking museum then don\u2019t go!", "If it isn't the consequences of my own actions.... As someone else said, you fucked around and found out. YTA.\n\nYou didn't even try to compromise.", "Yup, YTA, a huge one....\n\nYou actually thought that going on holiday, without taking your wife (when she wanted to go) was a good idea? Geeze Dude. Get a clue.\n\nHere's the thing: You showed her exactly what she means to you. Less than she should have.....\n\nAnd she was right to leave. \n\nOh, and she's not coming back man...... \n\nGet a lawyer, but be nice. This is your fault. Be a man and own it.", "YTA, and soon to be divorced.", "I just want to point out you have an issue with communication and reading cues. You couldn't tell your wife you wanted a different approach to this trip, you waited before telling her about the decision that you didn't want her on the trip, you figured everything was okay and she got over it and you didn't want to tell her immediately because that would start a fight.  Everything you hoped to avoid happened anyway because of your approach to this situation.  Also I think your wife feels rejected because you didn't take her on the trip.  How often does one win a all inclusive couple's holiday to Greece?", "You're getting a divorce.  Enjoy", "YTA. Also, you sound boring. Why go to another country just to not explore the country", "INFO: when you say you \u201cwon\u201d an all-inclusive couples trip at a charity fundraiser event, how did you \u201cwin\u201d this trip? Was it one of those auctions where you bid against other people on things? If so, where did the funds used for this bid come from?", "Dude, nobody goes on vacation to a foreign country to sit in the hotel. YTA", "YTA\nYou don't like your wife, and it shows, so she left. Done. Get over it. Stay single if you will treat your future spouse like that. \n\nThere is no good reason for leaving your wife at home. None. I do not know a single person who would remain with their partner if they did something like that. \n\nAt least she had the time booked off to move. I hope she finds someone that actually likes/loves her and wants to spend time with her instead of treating their free vacation like an opportunity to escape from the \"wife\". \n\nHoly shit. I can't even. \nToday was a good day, but reading this, makes me so disheartened that people like this exist and treat their partners like this. And he doesn't even understand why what he did was so bad...", "YTA.\n\nI understand the two of you having different ideas when it comes to vacationing. My wife and I are very different. She likes to be on the go constantly. I work a very physically demanding job that leaves me exhausted at the end of every day, so I like to relax, catch up on rest, read, etc.\n\nSo what we do is take one vacation together as a family, where we compromise. We\u2019ll go hard on some days and relax on others. Then once a year, my wife will go on a \u201cgirls trip\u201d with friends or our daughters, where they can go, go, go to their hearts content. While she\u2019s doing that, I\u2019ll take time off work just to relax and do nothing. I\u2019ll sleep late, read, piddle around the house working on projects, go catch drinks with my buddies. This lets us both get what we need that we don\u2019t completely get when traveling together. \n\nBut leaving each other behind on an all-inclusive couples holiday? That would never happen.", " YTA\n\nYou should have explained your stance with your wife and then stood your ground and got her promise that she would entertain herself during the day. Then you both could have gone for romantic dinners and dancing in the evenings.  That's called compromise.", "You realize that you don\u2019t have to go to Greece to wake up late and get a massage and do nothing right?!? You\u2019re an asshole. Her reaction was completely reasonable. I\u2019d leave you over this too.", "Well, the good news is you\u2019ll be able to travel unencumbered by your wife forever now.   Classic case of FAFO. YTA.", "YTA. What you did what selfish and made your wife feel unwanted and unappreciated.\n\nIf you don\u2019t end up getting served, book a holiday for you and your wife. On her terms. With what she wants to do. Push your own comfort aside. And apologise on hand and knees for being an idiot.", "YTA. You wanted to be single, so now you are.", "Your wife literally told you that you would be sorry if you went on this trip alone.  Since you did go alone and she chose to leave you\u2026..actions meet consequences.  Hope it was worth it.  YTA", "Huh YTA \nI\u2019m not an overthinker but jolly this would be an instant \u201che\u2019s effing cheating on me isn\u2019t he\u201d who goes on a COUPLES vacation alone\u2026. Yeah no don\u2019t buy it.", "YTA she told you you\u2019d be sorry if you did this, what the heck do you think that means? It means you do this and I won\u2019t be here when you get back, how did you not already know this? Your marriage is over. You wanted to be alone and now you are, what\u2019s the issue. You can\u2019t save this and you shouldn\u2019t since you can\u2019t even go on vacation with your wife. Why be married to someone you don\u2019t want to go on vacation with?", "YTA and if I were your wife I'd file for divorce. What you did is unforgivable. You told your wife she was so unimportant you'd rather throw out a ticket worth thousands of dollars than be with her. Well you got your wish for a lot longer than you wanted.", "YTA", "Yta. Honestly I would gift the item to either friends or family over not taking my wife.", "INFO: in all seriousness, what did you expect the outcome of this would be?\n\nYou left her alone to go on a \u201ccouples vacation\u201d by yourself. **Best case scenario** is you\u2019re sipping margaritas and swimming while she\u2019s at work and miserable.\n\nSo again, truly, what did you think the outcome would be? Did you *honestly* think you\u2019d go on this vacation and come back and your wife would be happy that you spent a week on a tropical couples vacation alone while she worked and kept up the house? What were you expecting her to do while you were gone?\n\nSo seriously, how did you think this was going to end?", "YTA and you\u2019re about to be single af.", "Someone is an AH here,  and it's not your wife.\n\nYTA,  and even moreso because you have to ask. But mostly,  YTA because you're somehow SURPRISED at her reaction. \n\nThe only surprise here is that she packed her own shit,  and not yours.", "YTA, you clearly don\u2019t love your wife. You\u2019d rather waste a ticket and go alone than be with her, your own wife. You told her you won a couples trip, she told you she couldn\u2019t wait to come. You waited a week to even tell her you didn\u2019t want her to go on a couples trip. The big hint here is COUPLES. Yet you couldn\u2019t stand your wife that much you\u2019d rather go alone. I\u2019d be devastated if my husband did this, it would show me how little he enjoyed my company. Well now you\u2019re alone and the wife you can\u2019t stand to go on a couples trip with is gone, deal with the consequences of your actions.", "Yta I wouldn\u2019t forgive you!  Who did you bring with you?", "YTA. Congratulations though, you get to travel without your wife forever now!", "You acted like you were single so now you are", "This can\u2019t be a real post.

Why would someone you promised to love and  cherish stick around?", "YTA - Work out your marital issues or prepare for a divorce. Not being able to compromise is a ridiculous reason to exclude your wife from a trip. If you truly can't figure out a compromise, I question why you're married at all. So again, figure this out or prepare for divorce.", "Obviously YTA. Deciding unilaterally that you wouldn\u2019t share this vacation with your wife is selfish and weird.

Enjoy your new single life of relaxation.", "Yeah, YTA. \nYou won a COUPLES holiday and didn't take the other person in your couple. \n\nI'd be pissed too if my husband made it clear he didn't want to go on holiday with me because he is stressed out and need a \"break\".", "YTA", "Lol YTA", "I hope you\u2019re nice a relaxed after your trip! I heard divorce is one of the most stressful things to go through.", "YTA\n\nHoly fuck are you the AH.\n\nYou won an all-expenses paid trip, and because you and your (soon to be ex) wife like to do different things, you ditched her?\n\nLord I hope you wear slip-on shoes, because you do not appear to have an ounce of common sense, and I am afraid you would hurt yourself with velcro.\n\nI get that you and your wife are polar opposites when it comes to things, but that's where being a mature adult in a relationship with someone you love comes into play.", "YTA.", "YTA.

And just becuase she hasn't mentioned divorce. Doesn't mean a damm thing. She isn't going to tell you her plans.", "YTA. How selfish can you be? Wow. \n\nNot to mention it sounds like you wasted a trip. You can sit in cafes and get massages at home, when you\u2019re somewhere like Greece you should sight see and immerse yourself in the culture.", "YTA acting like a single bachelor when you're married. Marriage is a team, good and bad, and you compromise to make it work. You act like a child and need to grow up. I hope she divorces you. You deserve it. So unbelievably selfish.", "YTA your wife is a smart woman", "Wait, you've always wanted to visit Greece, but you don't want to actually go out and see the place you're visiting?

She wants to get the most out of a vacation and you just want to sit, read, and get a massage in a hotel? stay state side then. She sounds like she just really wanted to go with you in particular.

There\u2019s no room for selfish behavior in a relationship", "Welp hope it was worth it, YTA", "I totally get the whole 'different way to spend vacation time' thing.

Did you get the monetary value of the other ticket, at least? What happened to the other ticket? I'm not 100%, but I'm pretty sure you could have cashed in the ticket.", "YTA, why are you even asking? Be so for real right now, how did you not rethink this ESPECIALLY when she let you know she was concerned you were cheating???  From this post I don\u2019t think you deserve to get her back in your life because I don\u2019t believe that selfishness should be rewarded. If I\u2019m being honest though she is likely working hard towards moving on.  It sounds like she believes that if you were not already cheating, then you planned to cheat on your trip (I\u2019m also thinking this may be true tbh). If she does believe this then it\u2019s done and sorry but it\u2019s your own fault. I\u2019m being genuine when I say that you need to get some basic common sense bc the fact that you went without her is insane to me.", "YTA. the fact that you enjoyed the trip while your wife didn\u2019t reply to one text tells me all i need to know. you did a great job trying to frame this like she\u2019s the villain but ultimately it\u2019s clear you are selfish and don\u2019t really care about her. i hope she finds better.", "YTA. What were you thinking and what did you expect?? Unbelievable.", "YTA and your an idiot why do you even want your wife back it doesn\u2019t really sound like you even like her it just sounds like you like being able to say shes your wife", "Cheering for the wife.", "If you're for real, YTA.\n\nThis is legitimately high in the running for dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I once explained to a grown adult human that there is no air in space or on the moon.\n\nMy man, I don't even know where to start on this, because its FUBAR.

She told you that you would regret it. She accused you of cheating and taking another woman with you and instead of doing anything to reassure her you just went without her.  You're a grown up. Act like one.  Have a conversation and say you'll go together as long as she's willing to compromise and let you have downtime to completely relax.

My (ex) partner announced he was going to Hawaii alone. Announced it in front of our friend and I was so embarrassed.  I didn't even think about the cheating thing since we were together everyday after work and all weekend. (We lived separately but very much together doing things with his family and mine).  In the weeks leading up to the trip I was \"quietly quitting\" the relationship.   I found out later on that he had \"met a girl there\".  I actually think he met her online way before the trip.  She moved here (which is weird because she's American and we're Canadian).  She couldn't stay in Canada so she moved close by but across the line.  Anyhoo, long story LONG...they broke up because he said she was a  Trump supporter and he couldn't wrap his head around that.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nA few weeks ago, I (28M) won an all-inclusive couple's holiday to Greece at a charity fundraiser event. I was thrilled, as it's somewhere I've always wanted to visit. I told my wife that I won, and she was also very glad and told me she couldn't wait to come along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing: me and my wife (27F) are pretty much polar opposites when it comes to travel. She likes to plan out a full schedule, wake up early, do loads of sight-seeing, walk around all day in the city and come back to the hotel exhausted. I, on the other hand, enjoy being a bit lazy, waking up late, spending time in caf\u00e9s reading books, and going for massages in the hotel. We've tried to come up with compromise solutions in the past, but it hasn't really worked. She gets very restless staying put in the hotel with me even for a single day (and complains about it constantly), and if I tell her to go by herself she tells me she'll be lonely or doesn't feel safe travelling alone. In the past, I've always ended up giving in and going with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently though, I've had a stressful couple months at work and I'm craving an opportunity to completely decompress without any schedule to stick to. So that was my plan for this trip. I thought for a long time about whether or not I wanted to bring my wife along, and in the end I decided I'd rather go alone. I didn't want to run the risk of having her complain all day even if she promised to do things in a more relaxed way, nor did I want to run the risk of being dragged unwillingly to museums etc by her. It took me about a week to decide this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo once I'd decided, I sat down and tried to broach the matter as sensitively as I could. My wife was FURIOUS. She'd had to pull in some favours to get time off work for the trip, and was completely outraged that I hadn't told her this sooner. In my defence, I didn't know she was going to so much trouble. If I'd known I would've told her about my hesitance. I didn't tell her as soon as I won the tickets because I wanted to avoid an unnecessary fight. She told me I'd be sorry if I didn't let her come, and then she basically accused me of cheating, saying that it was a couple's vacation and the only reason I wouldn't want to go with her was if I were planning to bring somebody else along, and that she didn't buy any of the reasons I gave above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings were a little cold between us for the subsequent days but I thought she'd managed to get over it by the time the date for the trip rolled around. I carried through with my plan of going alone and I had a fantastic time. I got back three days ago, only to find that she, and all her stuff, were completely gone. She left a letter on the counter calling me all manner of horrible things, including an AH. I know I haven't been an angel over this, but I don't think her reaction is reasonable. I want to try and get her back because I love her, but I need to know where I stand. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Plus I have depression and sometimes I don't even have enough energy for getting out of bed, let alone going on a walk. So we compromise and I go with him when I can, even though I wouldn't do it on my own. But when I can't, he understands it and stays and cuddles me in bed. \n\nThat's compromise, not my way or I'm complaining non-stop.", "And out of curiosity, if she had done this to you, what would you have done?", "Ahh yes, tacky jewellery from a gift shop is the perfect way to apologise to your wife for telling her you\u2019d rather go on an all inclusive holiday alone than be with her. Real classy.", "This would have been a dealbreaker for me, if my SO won a couple\u2019s trip and wouldn\u2019t bring me. I would be done. You say you love her, but you clearly don\u2019t respect her. You decided to die on this hill, and take a great opportunity away from your partner: the person who is there for you when you\u2019re struggling with work and life. You treated her as if she didn\u2019t matter. \n\nYou could\u2019ve decided how to divide up this trip to suit both of your needs, but you just said no to her. You could have set up a schedule of x days are just for me to be solo and decompress, you can go to the spa or anything you want solo, just not with me, please. You could have x days she plans and you tag along because sometimes you do stuff like that for your partner. You could have x days where it\u2019s your agenda together. But letting her get excited about the trip, arrange her life to go, and then drop on her she can\u2019t go and you won\u2019t budge even seeing how hurt she was: absolutely, without a doubt, YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t be in a partnership or marriage with someone who you don\u2019t want to be with or respect. If you want a solo trip, you discuss it with your partner and arrange it appropriately. You don\u2019t tell your partner about a couple\u2019s trip, get her excited, and then tell her some considerable amount of time later that she can\u2019t go.", "Dude, souvenir stores don\u2019t have nice jewelry.", "You texted her a handful of times?!  That\u2019s it?!  \n\nYou wanted to avoid an unnecessary fight?  It was fucking necessary. \n\nYou refuse to communicate with her and here you are all shocked pikachu face that she\u2019s gone. \n\nRightfully so, I\u2019d say. I wouldn\u2019t want to be with a partner who so blatantly didn\u2019t respect me.", "Oop no answer it seems lol"]}
