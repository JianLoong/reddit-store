From your comments, I see evidence that you work hard to be a good parent, have some great takes, and care for fairness, and your children. That being said, Generational trauma is very real, and can be hard to break, especially if you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing, or know better ways to handle these situations. \n\nNo parent is perfect, and things are going to slip under your radar that will hurt your relationship with your kids, and you may not understand why; this is one of those things. It doesn\u2019t make you a bad parent; from my limited view through your comments, it seems you strive to be a great one. But I think many peoples reactions to this, including my own initially, are driven by being burned by a similar mindset from a parent, maybe in more severe ways, maybe not. Intentional or not, it can be damaging, especially as your kids get older.\n\nTo the post: \n\nSitting within a movie isn\u2019t exactly 1 on 1 family time, I doubt he thought much of it. This seems unintentionally manipulative, trying to get him to come to something you knew he wouldn\u2019t if he knew you all had to go to the movie your younger kids wanted to see and not an agreed upon one, only revealing that to him once he came. You didn\u2019t make anything clear, make an effort for him to feel included/valued and *want* to spend time with you, and then you presented behavior to make him feel even more resentful/distant from you, amd villianized his actions when that obviously was not at all his intention. \n\nThe \u201cpeople aren\u2019t piggy banks\u201d aspect of this strikes me as something you should reflect on; I seriously doubt your 15 year old, a child, was thinking that. This situation was likely innocent, confusing for him, made him feel very rejected and not on the same page as you, and gave him the idea that you think he\u2019s greedy/entitled and treating you like a \u201cpiggy bank\u201d when he almost certainly thought this was an innocent request that you had offered, and now were retracting your word on, which he didn\u2019t understand. He made that very clear by saying it wasn\u2019t fair, because you had previously offered- meaning he thought this was the deal the whole time, and that his request was not unreasonable or unexpected. ESPECIALLY since your husband was seeing a different movie!\n\nYou didn\u2019t specify this before you left, and it created a misunderstanding. Rather than viewing this through that lens, you painted him as an intentional villian here, and that\u2019s painful for a kid. They can\u2019t read your mind, they\u2019re not thinking that many chess moves ahead, and he\u2019s still just that; a kid. They\u2019re going to need more clarity, communication, and understanding than you do.\n\n\nMy parents were similarly great parents, with unintentional flaws like all parents have, very similar to the miscommunication here. My dad put consistent effort in to understanding on his own time, managing his emotions as an adult, getting adhd meds, learning about RSD, etc- these misunderstandings reduced as we got older, and we continued to grow together and have a strong relationship. \n\nMy mom struggled to acknowledge she was wrong in these situations because of guilt and pride, (even if it was literally just to change her behavior going forward, or clear up the misunderstanding) and her relationship with all of us deteriorated over the years; it causes her much more pain than she should be in as well, having these points of view with assuming the worst about people\u2019s intentions. But when she has, it\u2019s been a small step forward each time.\n\n\nThere\u2019s some overreactions here, mainly because there\u2019s not a view of your parenting as a whole; I hope you\u2019ll consider the more reasonable points on here though, and potentially therapy to work through your feelings on these things, especially as your kids get older. \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA.

And in my experience working with kids, I think the value of movie nights / movie theaters as an experience is way lower for current teenagers than it was for even my generation \u2014 I\u2019m 25. This is just a theory, but I think Kids These Days (TM) have so much access to whatever media they want from the comfort of their home that they no longer see movie night as a particular treat. I remember going to see bullshit movies I had no interest in with my family/friends/boyfriend as a teen and it was still super exciting because I was with them. I also remember being SO excited when the teacher brought out the TV cart in elementary school, or when it was movie day in high school, even if we were gonna watch some boring (in our view) documentary. Now, teaching fourth grade, I can barely get kids to sit down and stfu for literally Shrek as a reward.

If he wants to see a different movie he shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for the ticket when you already said you would pay for the ticket to watch the original movie. \n\nTo me this sounds as some weird power play. As soon as your son has the chance to get a bit of independence it\u2019s snatched away from him, actually he never had it to begin with.

It's more like, you all go for ice-cream and vote on the flavour you will all take. Husband wants strawberry, you want chocolat, 15yo wants lemon and the two youngest want vanilla. So you decide everyone should have vanille, and when the 15yo asks for lemon when arrived at the ice-cream shop you say he can have it but has to pay himself. \n\nI agree with the YTA votes, these kinds of outings are not the place to teach your children lessons like you were trying to. Especially not if dad was allowed to watch another movie, if I read that right (not sure if I did).", "If we\u2019re using a restaurant instead of a movie theater, then the scenario would be more along the lines of him not wanting to order the same meal as everyone else, so you make him pay for his own dinner.  \n\nEven though these situations are completely different because at a restaurant, you are interacting with each other and talking, etc., whereas at a theater you\u2019re sitting in the dark watching a movie and (hopefully) not talking and making a bunch of noise.", "Great! Good for you, children having a source of income at 15 is not the norm, far from it. Don\u2019t equate your personal experience to the common norm, that\u2019s how conformation bias happens.", "My 7 year old earns her own money. She just saved and we got her something she wanted yesterday in fact. Teaches kids the value of money and how to budget and save.  \n\n\nThis should be parenting 101.", "I so agree with you. I thought the Mom handled it well. She is NTAH. But if she gave in her kid would continue to be.", "So what you\u2019re saying is \u201cdistinction distinction, distinction, different different, completely different\u201d.", "And that is why so many kids are failures. People are refusing to actually teach their kids life lessons. \n\n\nThen they come crying that their kids are entitled little crap heads...", "She said yes first but didn't mention conditions applied. Kid was already happy and they were going to movies, then OP at the last moment said the kid would have to pay with their own money. That's AH. If OP would have said the whole thing right in the beginning like \"Yes you can go see different movie if you pay with your own money\" then it would have been more ok, yet still controlling. But OP chose to be bully.", "Thank you! I feel like I'm going crazy reading these comments about consent and no money waaah. He agreed to go and watch a movie with them until he got there and decided to pull a bait and switch. He wasn't even forced to hang out with the family, but they were not going to cater to his whims. Seriously! The lesson is your parents aren't ATM machines. Period.", "It's how she took it. Wouldn't have been remomtely hard for her to say \"Okay, but if you do that you have to pay for it\" to make it clear from the start that if he made that choice then it's coming out of his pocket. Instead she waited until after he asked which is more than a little petty than just being upfront about it.", "Op didn't do anything wrong I'm pretty sure all these upset people in the comments are just teenagers that also didn't get what they want when they wanted", "**Because she didn't say when it was discussed. That's how you do things like this in an emotionally healthy way.**\n\nI'm 46. My parents did stuff like this as a consequence, I learned that my parents lie about money and are untrustworthy. Because they never did this shit to my younger siblings who fought them more, I learned that they cared a lot less for my wants, desires and needs. As a result, I kept that info to myself.  If I want something I have to get it for myself. As a consequence, they were usually the last people to learn about my plans when I visited. They were the last people I told when I moved directly from their home to NYC. They've since apologized and we've repaired this crap, but it did damage.\n\nWhat the OP claims to be doing--I'm paying if you want to join us, not to go to your own thing--is fine, **but it needs to happen when the kid can choose to stay home or go with friends or go with you--*****you know an actual fucking choice.*** What was the kid going to do, sit in the car? (I would have)", "Kid did, he was already there with them. Kid asked if he could watch other movie, OP promised and didn't mention conditions applied. Then at the last minute OP decides to be petty and say \"pay with your own money\". That's like offering a toddler a lollipop but eating it yourself in front of them and watching the toddlers disappointment just for fun. Who does that? AHs.", "He probably didn\u2019t have a choice in not going", "Firstly, we don't know the movie. Secondly, have you ever seen a Pixar movie? A DreamWorks movie? Studio Ghibli? The muppets movie? The Lego movie? It's not hard to find something everyone can enjoy", "The ages are 7,12 and 15. They vote through a system where everyone including the adults get a vote. Whichever gets the most votes they watch. Spiderman won with 2 votes (the youngest children).", "The number of chick flicks I was forced to sit through growing up, and my mother wonders why I turned out being a gay leaning bisexual lmao Just kidding that's probably not the cause it was cause I was bottle fed, no that's not it either the point is the excuse that it's a family activity even though it's clearly targeted for one person in the family is hardly a family activity and honestly completely unfair to the rest of the family members. I did get lucky from time to time where my Dad was also partaking in this family outing to the theater and my Dad would be like I'm not sitting through this I'm gonna go watch (insert current action movie here) and I'd get to join him, my Mom would be upset that we were ruining the family outing but my Dad and I lived with it and dealt with the consequences later, usually Mom just giving us the silent treatment for a couple days. But man it sure did suck when he'd be gone on a 6 to 8 month deployment and I had no way out of the chick flick scenario, the worst part was when I was old enough be be left at home alone if I chose to stay home instead of going to the movie I was basically grounded while my Mom and sister were gone, my Mom would legit take the power cords and cable cords with her so I couldn't watch TV or play any video games and I was forbidden from going outside. Usually it was easier to just suck it up and watch the chick flick.", "Some of y\u2019all are or are going to raise kids who are going to be all up in this sub one day posting stories of raging self entitlement and lack of empathy and self awareness, asking if they\u2019re the AH. Just sayin", "Yah, cos we never talk about movies, nor make jokes referring to them, or anything at all. Never ever has any group of people ever bonded over shared experiences and in-jokes based on movies etc they've enjoyed together. Not once! \n\nYour Macca's analogy doesn't work, for it to work he would be demanding to sit at a different table. And frankly, if we're out together and you won't eat with me, why am I paying for your food?", "If you want to be technical about the analogy, that\u2019s not really correct. It would be more like if the family was going to KFC or Popeye\u2019s and ordering a family meal, and the son arriving there only to say he wants to walk down the block and get a Big Mac instead. I think it\u2019s fair to not pay for the Big Mac and also to make the son aware he\u2019s being annoying and rude\u2014which OP didn\u2019t even do, she was totally cool with it and let him figure it out himself when he realized his mother didn\u2019t agree that he was entitled to it", "I wouldn't say he was TA, he was definitely trying out an idea, and was miffed his mum didn't fall for it. I've never had one family member decide they could break away from the group and expect Mummy to still pay for their own solo adventure.", "If you can hear it over the theater speakers,  it isn't whispering.", "OP does state that 15 YO would have to use his own money.  Kid has money = kid has income source.", "Ironic that you assume kids not having jobs at 15 is the norm . Wouldn\u2019t that be your own personal experience? Where I live lots of kids get their first summer job at 14 or 15. My 14 year old will be making $16.75/hr (which is the minimum wage here) working at an ice cream stand.", "I think it was a miscommunication. OP offered to pay to do X with their kid, so why would they pay for the kid to Y without them? No explanation needed, because of course that's how it works. And the kid thought that if OP was paying for a movie, it didn't matter which one, because of course OP would pay. Neither is really the AH this time, but OP needs to be clearer if it happens again in the future.", "This sounds like it all took place within a couple of minutes and I don\u2019t think the gap in sequencing is long enough to be a \u201cgotcha\u201d IMO, just part of the natural flow of the conversation about it. After all, he didn\u2019t decide he wanted to see something else until after they arrived, and then as he started to move away he asked for the money. \n\nI can see the parent being a bit thrown off by the sudden request but not wanting to be the bad guy and responding first with \u201cuhh sure honey if you really want to\u201d instead of \u201cfine but you\u2019re paying for it yourself\u201d.", "How is she supposed to make that clear early on when he told them his choice last minute?", "How could she have been more upfront?

Also some people are acting like the parents are abusive controlling terrible people.", "idk, it's been a while, but when I was 15 I wouldn't have wanted to watch any of those movies.  if you only get to go to the theaters a few times a year, it kinda sucks to be a teen and get stuck watching something obviously not made for you", "When I was growing up, we wouldn't consider breaking away and expecting anything would be taken care of by our parents. \n\nMaybe it's a generational thing, but 30 years ago when I was 16, I was content with whatever my parents would let me have/get away with, and when I wasn't, I was prepared to pay the piper if they found out (which,.... they tended to find out..). Anything beyond that, I'd pay for by myself with my earnings from the job I had (which sucked..).", "My God you are petty.", "My kids are in their 40s. \nWhen mine were 15, in a case as the OP presents this, I would have let my kid see the film of their choice (and I would have paid for their ticket) and chatted about the films over ice cream afterwards."]}
