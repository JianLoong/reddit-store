A parent doesn\u2019t have to buy their child a movie ticket. It\u2019s not food, it\u2019s not clothing or shelter. It\u2019s not education. Are you saying I have to give my children money for whatever they want because they are minors? I\u2019d be single-handedly funding roblox \ud83d\ude44", "Exactly, Does OP ask for separate checks when she drives the family  to the restaurant?", "My parents did this as a kid, and it wasn\u2019t weird at all. Comments like yours are baffling to me. You go see a movie as a family, and your parents pay. You say you wanna go to a different movie instead, so you buy your own ticket. That\u2019s not weird and doesn\u2019t require any crazy mental gymnastics\u2026", "I think you got to the heart of the matter. Control. The way she argues her point. Lady here is a chance to help him build independence under your watchful eye. Instead you give off petty use your money shut. What a joy you are.", "But what if you got to the breakfast restaurant and the person said, actually, I want to go somewhere else, can you give me the money you would have spent on pancakes and I'll just hit the drive through on the way home instead?", "The 10 piece mcnugget meal is on par both price and calorically with the big Mac. And let's not forget the majesty of the 20 piece!", "My dad was also a narcissist and our family of five(mom, dad, me, two younger sisters) had a similar voting system. I was constantly outvoted by my younger siblings and father because my father just did whatever my sisters wanted, and my mom went along with my dad. So then my options were either go do whatever my sisters wanted to do, or stay home and clean the house while everyone else was gone to \"earn money to do my own thing\".\n\nExcept I never cleaned good enough and he never paid me for cleaning.\n\n100% once my dad is decrepit enough I'mma put him in a home. It's not just the voting system, btw. There were a lot worse ways his favortism and punishment manifested in regards to myself vs my sisters, but one of the most mundane, \"fair\" ways was the voting system where it was rigged for me to loose.", "Is that seriously how you interpreted my comment? Because you sound pretty fucking stupid.", "Yes I probably went to the movies like 12 times in childhood my mom paid for me and my little sister to go to a different movie but the family outing didn't start until we went out to eat.", " She was 100% convinced that she was in the right and did not anticipate people saying that she is, indeed, the AH.  She came here for reassurance that she's an awesome mom handing out life lessons left and right and that her kid's an AH instead of her.", "Yep. She's really stupid but thinks she's wonderful.  There was no life lesson she was teaching that boy.  She was being petty and vindictive for whatever her purposes were.  Maybe she does stuff like that all the time.", "She basically did", "Controlling moms ugh \ud83d\ude11", "She would only pay for the movie if he did what she wanted (control freak)", "She used money to make him see the movie she wanted him to see. That's controlling. \n\nIt shouldn't matter what movie they see anyway. It's not like they'll be talking to each other and bonding during the film.", "i dont know what life you lead but the dynamic and relationship i have with my adult friends is not the same dynamic as the one i had with my parents as a minor", "They only get paid for 'good grades whatever that means and who knows how much or how frequent.", ">Sometimes in parenting you treat your children in one way because they are your minor child.\n\ngreat so you can accept that the dynamic between friends and the dynamic between parents and children are different and not comparable", "no, if you read what i actually wrote instead of ignoring it what im actually saying is that a parent paying for something for their minor child is not the same thing as a friend paying for something for their friend. do you ask your friends to pay for your food clothing and shelter with nothing in return? since you think friends paying for each other is the same thing as a parent paying for their minor child.", "But you would've paid for a ticket for him if he would've watched the movie together with the rest of the family - paying for a different movie would be the same amount of money. Ridiculous to suddenly make him pay.", "You know what they say about assumptions, ass-uming makes you an ass-hole.", "Then you need to have a conversation with him about it. You have to communicate with him for him to learn a lesson otherwise he\u2019s just gonna resent you.", "Does OP\u2019s son ask to go to a different restaurant than the rest of the family and then expect them to pay anyway? Lol", "You aren't going to a different theater though. The two situations don't feel comparable. And anyways, if your child doesn't want pancakes then you shouldn't force them to eat pancakes either. You have them stay for breakfast while everyone else eats and get them a juice or something and then get them something else on the way home. It's not entitlement- it's being a human with autonomy. You are the parent- the only reason for someone to observe this behavior is for control and that IS petty.", "YTA I've taken my kids to the theater before.  They wanted to see something I wasn't in the mood for.  I paid for their tickets to go watch a different movie altogether while I went to watch the movie I wanted to see...alone.  Apples to apples, oranges to oranges.", "No. (in Australia at least but I'm sure its not too far off in other countries).\n\nThe Big Mac has 2360kJ per serve while the 10 piece Chicken McNugget pack has 1810kJ per serve.\n\n[https://mcdonalds.com.au/sites/mcdonalds.com.au/files/Main%20Food%20Menu%20-%20Allergen%2C%20Ingredients%20and%20Nutrition%20Information-May-23.pdf.pdf](https://mcdonalds.com.au/sites/mcdonalds.com.au/files/Main%20Food%20Menu%20-%20Allergen%2C%20Ingredients%20and%20Nutrition%20Information-May-23.pdf.pdf)", "How much family time is being spent at the movies though? No interactions will take place, they\u2019re watching a screen with an entire crowd of people.

But that\u2019s just my opinion, as useless as it may be!", "There is no need to go that far even if you think OP is the AH. That is a personal attack and you\u2019re assuming a lot from one post. People have conflicts but that doesn\u2019t always mean they need to separate. And I\u2019m saying that as someone who is trying to get away from my parents. Please have some restraint, just because you\u2019re behind a screen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s acceptable to say that.", "Right now I'm accepting that you don't understand that the way you raise your child influences how they grow up and treat their friends and others.", "Most places dont have multiple restaurants in the same strip mall.", "No. It\u2019s the same", "We always would go to I\u2019ve cream and talk about the movie after", "Hey, OP, remember this comment you made when you get confined in a retierment home because none of your kids will want you near them.", "Movies are expensive. Why are you insisting on spending so much money for him to watch a movie he doesn't want to see rather than the same amount of money, buy everyone gets to have a good time? Forced \"family time\" isn't fun. You didn't create a bond here and you didn't teach him the lesson you think you did.", "Uhhh, yeah they do. That\u2019s extremely common lol", "Why did you post on here if you didn't want to hear feedback?", "Yea they never understand the reasons why. It is all some petty power trip to some parents. Thank god my parents loved me and didn't treat me like this.", "Have you parented a teen? It is really hard to address every possible assumption or contingency that might arise every time she is asked a question. I did that once and it was the most stressful parenting experience I've had. It kind of arose because the kid would say \"well, you didn't say\" and I fell for it and thought I had to actually address each and every possibility that she might try to get away with. It was awful. \n\n\n\nIt seems so obvious that this lady should have just thought of what assumptions her son might have and address it! But also she should have told him don't get a ride home with a friend if you bump into someone cause we are waiting on you, don't change your mind and go to the super duper long movie instead, don't take my money and spend it at the arcade instead and then send me impatient text messages asking if we are done because you are bored since you ran out of money in ten minutes.... It literally never ends when you are a parent. You cannot interact with your child by telling them all the possibly relevant expectations you have every single time they ask for something.", "The kid also would have known he was going to the movies with his family when getting in the car. He could have asked/said he wanted to watch a separate movie before going. The thing with family outings is that you do things together\u2026 at least that\u2019s what happens in my family. If the no talking aspect is bothersome, then why do most people not go to movies alone? Most go with others to have a shared experience. This sub can be wild at times."]}
