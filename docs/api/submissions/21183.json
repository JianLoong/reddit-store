And I\u2019m assuming since your 15 yo got in the car, he agreed to originally see that movie. Then he changed his mind. Okay so he\u2019s not going to be with the family and that money was for a family movie night. Am I crazy to think OP made a reasonable choice?

There is literally a whole ass episode of Johny Test where it's a family of 5 and the teenage boy is always outvoted and can't do the things he enjoys. I don't understand why it makes a difference what movie he was watching? That's like saying hey we're gonna get McDonalds, but I'll only pay if you want the bigmac, if you want chicken nuggets u gotta pay for yourself.", ">It ends up being pretty random and even in the end.\n\nIn that case I'm going to vote NTA. You were a little petty, but I don't think you were petty enough to for me to feel right calling you an AH. \n\nPlus, I can understand your reasoning; these activities are specifically meant to be for family bonding, which is hard to do if everyone is off doing their own thing. And with your eldest three years away from being a legal adult, you probably want him to be part of these activities while he still lives at home.", "Well you never answered why you didn\u2019t ASK your son if he had money to pay and if he was going to.", "You literally assumed he was paying. If you wanted him to pay you should have said so. \n\nStop acting like you\u2019re an incompetent parent. You\u2019re not teaching him anything other than mom will control him with money and expect him to be a mind reader. You\u2019re the adult.", "He assumed you were going to pay because you took them all to the movies!f", "Jesus Christ, you playing some major mind Olympics there.", "This kind of parsing of unwritten family contract law will make his therapist very wealthy in the future. He assumed you would pay because earlier you said you would pay for a movie. You didn't say \"I'll pay for a movie as long as you sit with us.\" Once you're at the cinema what difference is it to you? \n\nWe know it isn't about the ticket or the money. Deal with your control issues, deal with the fact that he's growing up, whatever it is.", "You are a horrible excuse for a parent. Massively YTA", "YTA... Question, did he vote that he wanted to see the Spiderman movie or the movie he wanted to go into when you got to the theater?\n\n>If you invite someone on an outing, you pay. Everyone knows that\n\nNo, that's really not how that works. If my friends ask me to do something with them, I do not automatically assume they are paying. Just like this morning after church, my partner and I had friends at church. The friends asked if we wanted to go to breakfast with them. We said yes and we had a fun time. When it came to the check, I spoke up and said it'll be the two of us on one ticket. I never assume anyone will pay for me. Just like with my family, I ask my mother out to eat but she doesn't assume I am paying for her... Heck most of time she says she'll pay even though I asked her out to eat.\n\nLet me also say this, my partner and I have mutual friends we go on vacations with. This year they asked us if we would like to go to Panama City, Panama. The friend that asked us is going because he has family that lives in Panama City. By your reasoning, since we said yes they should pay for everything?!? Lmao... a free trip, heck yes please! But wait, we get to the airport and there is no ticket for us because I made an ass out of me by assuming someone would pay my way just because they asked me to go with them.\n\nThere were plenty of times my parents wanted to see a particular movie but I didn't want to see it. So, instead of leaving me at home just to sit around, they would pay for me to go skating with friends or even drop me off at an arcade and give me 20 bucks when I was 15. I worked during the summer mowing the yard but they would still give me money to stuff.", "... you son didn't decline. He went to the movies. He just didn't sit in the same room as you.", "And when you decide to have kids you\u2019re responsible for paying for them or making it clear when you won\u2019t pay for something.", "Sounds like your mind is all made up. Reiterating yta.", "then if your so right lol then why did u bother posting asking for everyones opinion ?  it seems your mind is made up and being a snot about it to boot.", "Did he have money on him for a ticket? Or did you know he didn\u2019t and decided to do a bait and switch just to be petty?", "Why did you post here if you are going to reject everyone's response and reiterate yours? YTA.", "Nope you\u2019re a controlling B and an AH! YTA OP", "Cus you're a pissy b* who's ego was bruised because your son had thoughts of his own and you needed to punish him for it and show him you're the one in control.\n\n\nIf you think \"my way or the highway\" is good parenting, then your kid is gonna hit the highway as soon as he can.", "You came here and asked if you\u2019re the asshole. You are an asshole mom lol", "He is your child and dependent on you. Per your own words he asked you. He has no ability to pay for it himself so asking you if he could see the movie implied that you would be giving him the money for it if you said yes. By saying yes and then taking it back by not giving him money you were just being mean. This doesn\u2019t teach the lesson you think it does.", "she's teaching him it is better to be with together family moping instead of doing something enjoyable.\n\nYTA", "Lol. No? I'm not going to leave my seven and twelve year olds alone for two hours?", "He has money. The kids get paid for their grades.", "How am I controlling him? In life, when you want things, you usually have to pay for them. That's an important lesson to learn.", "And then he changed the family\u2019s plan they had voted on earlier\u2026", "Yeah she's giving me I'm always right and won't ever aplogize.", "So, I'll repeat the question. If your parents invite you to dinner and you decide to sit at a different table, do they still pay?", "While I agree she should\u2019ve made it clear when he wanted to split up\u2026 \u201cit is a family outing and if you aren\u2019t going out as a family to spend time as a family then you will need to pay for you own ticket. We will meet up for ice cream as a family after.\u201d\n\nIf he chose to go out with his friends and OP did not supply the $ then it should be the same right?\n\nNot sure how I would\u2019ve handled it but I do agree if the child doesn\u2019t want to do the family outing then he doesn\u2019t have to.", "From the sound of it he didn\u2019t mention wanting to see a different movie until they got there, so it seems like they both sort of sprung it on each other. \n\nDoes seem like OP a bit reactive and pissy \u201cwhy would I give you money?\u201d rather than proactive and calm \u201cok sure, but in that case you buy your own ticket, ok?\u201d But on the other hand, the kid had already started to walk away then came back to get the money, so she may have thought he already understood he was now taking himself out to the movies. \n\nThis seems like a situation that will come up more and more as the kids get the older, so if that\u2019s what she wants a standing rule \u201cfamily excursions are paid for, if you\u2019re not with the family you pay out if your allowance\u201d would lead to less drama.", "Your husband was with them.", "Well I have a feeling he\u2019s going to  start saving it more to get away from you come 18.", "I thought getting paid for grades went the way of the dinosaurs? That's controlling.", "Then maybe you should have used that brain and told him \u201cyes you can go to x movie by yourself but I think you would need to pay for it, do you have money?\u201d", "No, they wouldn't. But that's totally irrelevant because it's not the same situation AT ALL. Let me explain it to you like you were 5.\n\nIn a movie, you would sit in silence while watching a screen. The people sitting around you won't change your movie experience. The movie you watch stay the same and the social interactions are (and should be) zero.\n\nAt a restaurant, you would talk with the people around the table. The people sitting around you will change your experience because it's all about social interactions.\n\n.... do you understand the difference ?", "That\u2019s not the situation at all. You have plenty of opportunity to tell you son if you do this, you pay. You knew he wasn\u2019t interested in the movie. You agreed to let him do it. You weren\u2019t clear on conditions.", "He wanted to watch Dial of Destiny. Which the kids had zero interest in.", "Oh yeah, definitely. That'll sure teach me.", "He has money. He just didn't want to spend it.", "So you're saying, if your parents invited you to come watch a movie with them, and you accepted, and once you arrived you decided you would prefer to watch something else, your parents would still buy your ticket? Even though you are an adult? Is that what you're telling me?", "So maybe you all shouldn\u2019t have gone to the movies or force the whole family to go.", "Yeah lady, that's what you signed up for when you decided to have multiple kids. But your teenage son didn't sign up to have siblings and it's not his responsibility to sit through a kids movie he has no interest in because you and your husband needed more kids", "I mean you\u2019re not teaching him much either \ud83d\ude02", "Fast forward 20 years:\n\nWHY WONT MY SON ANSWER MY CALLS?!?!?", "Why post here if you\u2019re not going to listen lol", "It WILL teach you. You might think you're strong and mighty behind your keyboard today but when your son distances himself from you, you will look back on things like this and know you could have prevented it by choosing your battles and a fun outing is not the time for a life lesson. He will remember this and I can only assume a multitude of other controlling/withholding things you've probably done and will do in the future. Your husband and most people in the thread think you're wrong here. Are you going to reflect or just argue until you fall asleep tonight?", "YTA. Do you even like your son? Also in another comment you mentioned that you didn't even want to see the movie you went there for but had to because one parent needed to look after the youngest two and your husband had already decided it would be you. Did your husband give you a similar argument about money? Was this your way of taking out your frustrations on someone else seeking independence that you no longer seem to have?", "And yet you didn\u2019t make that condition clear when you agreed to it.", "YES. And if it was reversed, and I would be the one paying, I would still pay. Because I am not petty. And the quantity of time spent with them would be pretty much the same. So why not let them enjoy a movie they will actually like instead of forcing them to watch something they don't want to ? Seems like a waste of money to me.", "Your son isn\u2019t an adult. He\u2019s a minor and he asked you to do x and you said yes. You could have said no and this is a family outing or yes you can go but you\u2019re paying for it.\n\nYa didn\u2019t and you don\u2019t want to accept that. Literally everyone made it clear to you.", "My father would have, yes. But, unlike you, he was a generous soul. \n\nYou asked if you\u2019re TA, but then argue with anyone calling you out. So why did you bother posting?", "When I was 15, my mother would have bought me a ticket to go see a movie without her or any other family having any involvement whatsoever. \u201cYou\u2019re my child but I will only pay for things for you if you do exactly what I want you to do. Otherwise you\u2019re on your own. I don\u2019t care that you aren\u2019t even old enough to have a job.\u201d", "My parents would absolutely pay for me to see whatever I want to see, even if it was different to what they are seeing. Just like if my children want to see something different to what myself, their father or siblings are seeing then I happily pay for that. It costs the same for them to see a different movie than it does to see the same one as everyone else. Going to the cinema is supposed to be enjoyable for everyone in the family, not just some of them. \nBut then again my parents are good parents you on the other hand are not", "We didn't force the whole family to go. He's fifteen; he could have stayed home if he wanted. He stays home from outings all the time.", "This is too funny. I don't even know where to start. No one gets to decide whether or not they have siblings.", "Give it up. This mom is TA refuses to see her son as a teenager. I\u2019m grateful I didn\u2019t have a mom like her.", "Mine absolutely did.", "For sure I'd  pay for my son to see a different movie. \nYTA"]}
