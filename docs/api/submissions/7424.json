Shawn came in and asked if we were both alright but why did I have Bruno with me. I reminded him that I don't leave Bruno alone if I don't have to so I asked him to have whoever owned the big dog leave so that I could stay.

Shawn said he still doesn't have a problem with Bruno but his friend asked if he could bring his dog and he doesn't get to see that friend often so he said yes. I told him he's essentially picking his friend over his girlfriend because of dogs but Shawn says its only because his friend actually asked to bring his dog and he asked first, if I had mentioned wanting to bring Bruno first than he would've said yes to me and no to his friend due to how Bruno is with other dogs. I did leave the party but really, I expected him to have my back and put me first since I'm his girlfriend. I've been ignoring his calls but my roommate is starting to tell me I'm acting like an ass because I never should've asked to him to make his friend leave and that I should have given Shawn a heads up.

You ALWAYS give a heads up when you want to bring a pet along! And you sound unbelievably entitled demanding someone leave at someone else\u2019s party just so you could stay with your unapproved doggy plus one.\n\nMaybe instead of having everyone cater to your dog\u2019s needs you can work out his behavioral issues so he can actually be near another dog.", "YTA \n\nYour BF\u2019s friend asked if he could bring his dog. You didn\u2019t ask, you assumed it would be fine. It wasn\u2019t fine because your dog is not well socialized. Your dog was the problem so you asking someone else to leave was inappropriate.\n\nSo you were an AH for taking your dog without permission, and AH for asking someone else to leave to accommodate you, and an AH for then stonewalling your partner instead of dealing with the issue like an adult.", "YTA. Your dog, your problem. No one else's.\n\nAnd don't use the \"picking your friend over me\" argument. It doesn't work in this situation.", "YES, loud and clear YTA.", "YTA.  I know you think your dog is very special and everyone should cater to it but it\u2019s only that special TO YOU. Shawn doesn\u2019t have to do anything with your dog, you\u2019re literally bringing it into HIS SPACE without even asking. \n\nAlso please find your dog a behaviorist. It sounds like a pandemic dog and has some issues you need to work through with a professional.", "YTA. You can\u2019t just bring your dog without asking to other peoples houses. Your dog is not entitled to be there without permission, ESPECIALLY if they have behavior issues like this. And this is coming from someone with 3 rescues that all do not do well with strange dogs.", "It's the bare minimum of common courtesy to give someone a head's up that you plan to bring your dog to their house. YTA", "Yeah, YTA. Your appearance with Bruno may have been something to be expected, but the other guy specifically asked if he could show up with his dog.\nYou're asking the host to revoke a welcome specifically given", "YTA\n\n1. You should have told Shawn you intended to bring Bruno. Even if you \"usually\" bring him, Shawn can't read your mind and anticipate that you would bring your dog to a *party*.\n2. You should not have asked Shawn to ask the friend with the big dog to go home. You should have offered to take Bruno home.\n3.

Its a party, you still should have OKd it ahead of time", "YTA to ask if the other person and their dog could be asked to leave. They had asked for and got permission to be there. Being the gf doesn't trump that.", "You\u2019re *that* pet owner. YTA", "YTA. This problem could have easily been avoided if you had talked to Shawn about bringing the dog. You brought him over before, but a party is different than just you two hanging out (e.g. there could also be guests that are allergic to or afraid of dogs).

Couldn\u2019t you take you dog back home and come back? Why do you think it would be acceptable for him to make his friend leave, who specifically asked if he could bring his dog.", "YTA \n\nHe told you exactly what you should have done leading up to that.

I take them whenever we can, but always ask first.   Not only did you not ask, but you threw (are throwing) what sounded like a childish tantrum over this.  I think it\u2019s because  you are embarrassed as you think he picked his friend\u2019s dog over you and you lost out to a dog.  That\u2019s not the case, you should be embarrassed over your own behavior, but he didn\u2019t pick a dog over you.  Sheesh.  Your bfs response was completely logically and you went overboard nuclear reaction.", "YTA.

I can see if it was just your boyfriend but this was a party and you have no idea if anybody is terribly allergic to dogs or incredibly fearful of them. Terrible manners.", "YTA. You decided to bring your dog over to your boyfriend\u2019s place without asking him. And then, you had the nerve to tell him to kick out the person who actually had permission to bring their dog. You being his girlfriend isn\u2019t a golden pass that means he has to instantly cater to you.", "Of course YTA\n\nI love dogs but you never bring a dog to someone else's home without asking, specially if there's going to be a party.\n\nAlso you seriously expected your bf to kick his friend out of the party after he actually asked for permission and was allowed? How would you feel if a friend did that to you?\n\nIt would be totally different if you had actually asked, and asked first, and then your bf, knowing Bruno doesn't get along with other dogs, allowed his friend to bring his dog. If that was the case then you would be totally justified.\n\nConsidering what actually happened though, yeah sis, you were a huuuuge AH", "YTA your bf did not choose his friend over you, he chose his friend over your dog! You could have taken the dog home and get back to the party had you chosen to do so.

He\u2019s not a mind reader.", "YTA You should ask before taking your dog to someone\u2019s house but you especially need to do it when that person is having a party. You admit your dog has behavioural issues so you definitely should be asking for that reason alone.", "YTA, what if one of the guests was allergic to dogs?

People like you who are entitled and think they can bring their dog everywhere are insufferable.", "YTA. You should have cleared it with him first. When it is just you and him then no big deal but you knew it was a party and brought your dog.

YTA", "YTA\n\nThe friend asked if he could bring his dog. You didn't and just assumed. It would have been unfair for Shawn to make the person who actually asked to leave. \n\nJust because you're currently Shawn's girlfriend doesn't mean he has to back up your unreasonable demands.", "YTA Your boyfriend is not a mind-reader. Cut the \u201che\u2019s choosing his friend over his girlfriend\u201d crap, he wasn\u2019t presented with a choice, his friend and the dog were already there. Also as someone who has a traumatized dog with separation anxiety, I\u2019d suggest you start training your dog to be alone, for everyone\u2019s sake. Leave for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc., and try till he gets comfortable with longer periods of time. If you can afford it, get help from a behaviorist.", "YTA. Your dog is aggressive, and that makes you feel you can chase both other people and other dogs, who already had permission to be there, away. Yikes.", "YTA for multiple reasons. (Coming from a vet tech and dog trianer)\n1. Your dog is the reactive dog. The other dog is, by your own account, a well-behaved and socialized dog. Since your dog is the problem dog, it should be the one removed from the situation. Basic dog owner etiquette. You're the kind of asshole that shows up to the dog park with an asshole dog and expects everyone else to leave, so you can have the whole park to yourself. \n\n2. YTA for expecting your boyfriend to choose you over his friend when you are CLEARLY in the wrong. He got permission.  You didn't. This ride or die and choose me over all else even when I am wrong is toxic and immature. \n\n3. You didn't ask permission to bring your dog to a gathering. It's different when it is just you and your boyfriend. But you didn't know who would be there, if they had severe allergies or phobias. You're not just am asshole, but an entitled asshole. \n\n4. Putting your rescue dog, with a known history of reactivity, into a stressful situation. A large gathering of unknown people is extremely stressful for dogs. Also, just becauee he is a rescue dog, doesn't mean he can't be left alone while you socialize or do other things. As long as you're not leaving him home alone all day and evening every night, being honr by himself while you go out after work is fine. People like you are exhausting with their \"rescue\" dogs that they feel need to be handled with kid gloves all the time. If he has separation anxiety, talk to your vet and a trainer and work with both of them to correct his anxiety issues. If this isn't something you can't afford then you should npt have gotten a rescue dog that you can't properly care for. \n\n5. YTA for giving silent treatment and not responding to his calls. Even IF he was wrong (he's not), you would be the asshome for this alone. But you're an even bigger asshole because you're punishing with silent treatment (a form of abuse) for your own wrong doing.", "[deleted]", "Yta as if he\u2019s going to prioritize a 6 month relationship over a friend he barely gets to see. It\u2019s not your house so you are way entitled saying others have to leave. Who goes to a party with their dog though without asking I can\u2019t deal with your thought process", "YTA. Bruno has behaviour issues that you need to address. His friend asked him if he could bring the dog, you didn't. I'm not sure why you think the other person should have to leave if they were given permission. \n\nBeing the girlfriend doesn't give you a right to be unfair. Next time ask your roommate to take care of Bruno.", "YTA. Being the girlfriend doesn't give you automatic entitlement.", "Pretty sure you're only going to get YTA votes on this one", "YTA - bringing him over without asking day-to-day, no problem. Bringing him to a party without asking is a huge AH move. What if one of his friends had an allergy or fear of dogs? His other friend did the polite thing by asking, so of course they take priority. \n\nAlso, your dog is the only reason he couldn\u2019t stay.  The other dog is socialized to other dogs and didn\u2019t mind yours being there. If yours was socialized they could have stayed together. I\u2019m not blaming your dog for it\u2019s anxiety, but it is on you to make sure that the environment is comfortable for them, which you failed to do.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t care who you are, you are not welcome at my house if you don\u2018t first ask if you can bring your dog.  This goes for small children too.  You took advantage and now are pouting over a problem cause by you and only you.  Make a sincere apology and ask next time.", "YTA also if you know that your dog has behavioral issues just saying \"he's a rescue\" isn't enough. Getting a rescue with problems is a noble and kind thing to do but that means you are signing up for a harder training process to help the animal heal. \n\nNo one else cares that \"he's a rescue\" all they see is a shitty dog and more prominently an owner that doesn't care that their dog is shitty. Be a responsible dog owner, train the dog to be good and don't bring him around other people or dogs until you do before someone gets injured", "YTA. You do need to work on your dog\u2019s obvious separation anxiety if you refuse to leave him alone. I\u2019m a pet caretaker, and it\u2019s impossible to handle because you\u2019re basically making yourself or anyone who cares for him a slave to handling the problem.", "Grow up!!!\n\n\nYou made an assumption and it blew up in your face..\n\nStop playing silly little games by ignoring him when he has done nothing wrong\n\nYou sounds exhausting", "\"close to 6 months.\" lmfao stfu", "YTA. It\u2019s a party, not a casual evening with your bf. You should\u2019ve asked. What if someone was afraid or allergic? Never assume you can bring your dog to someone\u2019s house all the time. I always check with people, even if 99% of the time they say \u2018yes\u2019.", "Yikes OP. Dog trainer here. I\u2019ve had *many* rescues in my life, and you 110% should always ask about bringing your dog anywhere, whether it\u2019s your boyfriend\u2019s house or not (especially for a party!!)\n\nYou needlessly stressed out your dog because you made an ignorant assumption that there would be no other animals present. Get your dog a trainer, put him on trazadone for training period, and work with him to overcome his obvious fear-based aggression.\n\nYTA. It wasn\u2019t your house and not within your right to ask that Shawn\u2019s friend leave. It\u2019s already water under the bridge, but you don\u2019t seem cut out for owning a dog with emotional problems that clearly needs training. Our dogs look to us for leadership, and it takes someone very confident and consistent to provide that, especially for a rescue dog. If you continue coddling your dog you will end up with way worse issues. Please see a trainer.", "INFO: Are you taking any steps to address the issues with your dog?\n\nEdit: I have a full reply below, but YTA for being an inconsiderate dog owner.", "YTA his home, his friend got cleared to bring the dog ahead of time, and you did not. He's being extremely fair, while you're being extremely entitled. He should take note of your behavior, and reconsider you as a mate.", "YTA. You don't bring an animal to someone's house without permission.", "So your dog has shown signs of aggression and you think it's a good idea to show up with him unannounced to parties?? YTA. Your dog is going to hurt another animal or person someday and it's 100% going to be your fault.", "YTA.\n\nYou always need to check with people before bringing your pet. Your boyfriend was absolutely correct; all you had to do was let him to know you were bringing Bruno to the party.", "YTA. You can't assume it's OK to bring your dog with you.

I wouldn't dream of bringing my dog somewhere without asking.", "YTA yes he's your boyfriend but you always check to see if you can bring a dog to someone else's house when there's a party on.\n\nYour dog is not good with others. That should have given you enough reason.\n\nEspecially TA for persisting when your BF said he hadn't seen his friend in a while.

The rest of this I'm not touchimg with a ten foot pole.", "If you wanted/needed special accommodations, you should have brought it up in advance. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have had a regular need to bring Bruno when you go to Shawn\u2019s house, so I wouldn\u2019t expect Shawn to deny his friend\u2019s request to bring his dog to the party simply because he expected you to need to bring Bruno. The worst aspect of this is your sense of entitlement, first by asking Shawn to tell his friend to leave, then by asserting relationship status when Shawn denied your request. I have a hard time seeing how this is such an issue if you\u2019ve had to bring Bruno to Shawn\u2019s house only a couple of times in the six months you\u2019ve been dating.\n\nYou roommate is right.

There has been a couple of times I've stopped at his house when I've had my dog Bruno with me. He's a rescue so I try to not leave him alone for long periods of time if I don't have to outside of work. He does fine with people but not so much with other dogs.\n\nShawn had a party at his house and I was invited. Since I planned on being gone for most of the day and he never said he had a problem with Bruno the times I've brought him over before, I just brought Bruno with me. I get there and go back to his yard and Bruno started to bark right away because there was this huge dog laying out in the yard. It didn't turn serious thankfully because I was able to get Bruno inside since he was still leashed and the other dog didn't really get up. Shawn came in and asked if we were both alright but why did I have Bruno with me. I reminded him that I don't leave Bruno alone if I don't have to so I asked him to have whoever owned the big dog leave so that I could stay. Shawn said no and I asked him why not because he's never had a problem with Bruno before. Shawn said he still doesn't have a problem with Bruno but his friend asked if he could bring his dog and he doesn't get to see that friend often so he said yes. I told him he's essentially picking his friend over his girlfriend because of dogs but Shawn says its only because his friend actually asked to bring his dog and he asked first, if I had mentioned wanting to bring Bruno first than he would've said yes to me and no to his friend due to how Bruno is with other dogs. I did leave the party but really, I expected him to have my back and put me first since I'm his girlfriend. I've been ignoring his calls but my roommate is starting to tell me I'm acting like an ass because I never should've asked to him to make his friend leave and that I should have given Shawn a heads up.

Simple as that.", "YTA \n\nYou ASSumed you could bring Bruno. \n\nAnd Bruno is antisocial with other dogs!\n\nInfo - what are you doing to work on Bruno\u2019s antisocial behaviour?\n\nThe other friend ASKED if he could bring his dog. \n\nHaving your \u201cback\u201d doesn\u2019t mean kicking people out of a party when they were invited and doing nothing wrong.  \n\nTake your dog home and go back to the party like a big girl!", "YTA. You assumed you could bring your dog to a party without asking. You asked him to make another guest leave? There is zero reason your dog couldn\u2019t stay home for the duration of a party but you feel justified to inflict it on everyone else because\u2026.entitled. Rescue does not mean \u201cincapable of being alone;\u201d that is your problem. Not the dog\u2019s.", "YTA.   Jeez,  go get Bruno some training or take a crate with you on hand.   Your the problem. And what a yucky demand to make,  yta.", "Yta", "YTA.", "YTA and delusional... asking someone else to leave because your dog cant behave. And especially when they asked permission to bring their dog and you didnt.. how are you this entitled?", "Yta\n\nPrioritizing you doesn't mean what you think it means.", "YTA.  Lots of decisions get made that aren\u2019t about a love interest\u2019s sense of entitlement.  You were off base to not ask because you had no way to know who would be there.  It isn\u2019t about choosing you.  It may be that you hope to train him that every relationship in his life will inevitably be a test about choosing you until you are the only one in his life.", "YTA. Use your words and *ask*.", "Yta it healthy for dogs to self regulate and be alone 2nd it your dog leavr it home only stay a few hours or ask first..", "You both could have stayed with your dogs if yours wasn\u2019t poorly trained and unsocialized. That\u2019s a you problem. YTA", "YTA his friend asked in advance if he could bring his dog.\nYour partner said yes.\nYou did not ask permission to bring Bruno and expected your boyfriend to rudely kick out his friend who did the right thing and now you\u2019re pouting because he let his friend stay.", "YTA. I\u2019m with your boyfriends reasoning on here. These are situations you get yourself in by making assumptions", "It's absolutely not okay to ask people to leave so you can stay, especially since they expressly got permission to bring their dog. YTA", "YTA, you shouldn't just bring a dog to a party. At least the friend asked.", "Ma\u2019am, are you okay? This situation was not about him having your back or putting you first. This was about your blatant entitlement. How do you even have the gall to walk in to someone else\u2019s home, and demand one of their guests leaves immediately to please you?! \n\nYour roommate is 100% correct. YTA.", "YTA- your dog had the problem, you needed to leave. You could have dropped your dog off and come back. This other dog was causing no issues, had permission before coming and you wanted this person and his dog kicked out because your dog isn't able to socialize yet? Wow. Just wow. This would be a great time to work on some introspection and empathy.", "YTA. I love that your immature ultimatum of \"it's him or me\" blew up in your face!", "This 100%. Also something tells me the boyfriend is going to stop calling for good.", "Exactly. And honestly, 6 mos. is a short time to be dating. YTA.", "The dog shouldn\u2019t be out in public without a harness and a muzzle until you\u2019re in training, and even outside of training. Once an aggressive dog, always an aggressive dog. Regardless you showed up with this animal with no warning so that makes you the AH", "Yoh also need to start leaving your dog alone. Bringing him everywhere you can just because he's a rescue isn't good. He needs to learn to be on his own even when you aren't at work. Sooner or later separation anxiety will occur and if you're not careful, it will spread to when you are at work.", "Why is this getting down voted? Yes we all know she is a resounding AH in this situation, but this comment shows she is taking the exact correct steps to improve her dog's behavior. Y'all are wild sometimes.", "Easy. She\u2019s taking steps to correct the dogs behavior, but she didn\u2019t mention what she\u2019s doing to correct her own behavior. Of course she\u2019s the AH, but not because of her dog\u2019s behavior, she\u2019s the AH because she assumed she could show up with an untrained dog and everyone would have to accommodate her. She gave no heads up and still had the audacity to expect the guest who did actually ask to have his dog there to leave. Great, she\u2019s getting her dog the training it needs, but she needs to check her own entitled behavior as well.", "You are spot on, but the comment in particular is just answering a question. Seems unfair to me for this comment in particular to get downvotes, but hey, whatever. Hopefully she'll take the downvotes as confirmation that everyone thinks she is an AH and that she needs to work on being less entitled in the future.", "You\u2019re right though, Reddit is wild! If she posted this an hour later she might have ended up on a side of Reddit telling her she did nothing wrong and should keep the dog and ditch the BF \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
