My dad married her thinking she was 6 years younger than she is and only found out because my grandmother told him the truth. All of her boyfriends after my father were told my siblings and I were substantially younger than we were to make her appear younger. My mother was blessed with very good genetics and is beautiful so she gets away with telling people she is younger than she is.\n\nMy mother has always lied to her boyfriends about a lot of things to get them to live with us and basically take care of us financially. So her introducing a boyfriend like she did this time is very normal. However, this man is pretty young and after a couple of days of him living there my siblings have noticed that my mother has lied to him about almost everything. I do not live at home, I moved out at 18, so I am getting this information from my siblings.\n\nMy mother has told this man that she is only 40-years-old and that my sister is actually the nanny and that she adopted my sisters 4-year-old son. My two brothers are now 5 years younger than they actually are, and I apparently do not exist. My mother is from Mexico, so she has a very strong accent. She is half Spaniard though so she can pass as white if not speaking. Her last name is my dads German last name and she never changed it because she says she prefers to have a white last name. So she told her boyfriend that she is fully German and the only reason why she has a Mexican accent is because she was raised in Mexico.  \n\nNow, this man is paying for everything in the house. The rent, food, utilities, EVERYTHING! And has been giving my mother money for months because he thinks both of my brothers are still minors (one is and one isn't) and their father doesn't help. My siblings are my half siblings, though we were all raised by my biological dad. So this made me mad because if anything our dad has always been there to support all of us and she is giving him a bad name. \n\nMy siblings are over my moms bs and are so used to this they don't plan of saying anything. They are also moving out soon so really don't care. I feel for this guy because he is still so young and deserves to know the truth. I plan on heading to their house on New Years Day to tell him everything (including of my existence), but my aunts have told me not to because then my mom might not have enough money to pay the bills and will get evicted. They told me that I would be a horrible person if that happened because of me.", "created_utc": 1672464588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzmgqp/aita_for_revealing_all_of_my_moms_lies_to_her_new/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do consider your sister and the 4-year-old, and anyone else who may suffer ill effects, and suggest resources to help them arrive at a more stable living situation.", "NTA. \n\nIf your mom gets evicted, it\u2019s not because you told the truth. She gets evicted because she cannot pay her own bills. Don\u2019t let them shift blame onto you. \n\nAt first I was meh about her lying about her age/origins. But then lying about who OTHER people in the family are? Just wow.", "NTA. That\u2019s bananas, frankly. He deserves to know the truth. Honestly, I\u2019d be surprised if he wouldn\u2019t find out soon enough but save him wasted time. Best of luck.", "NTA and that\u2019s actually pretty disturbing behavior on her part. Sociopathic honestly. Lying that easily to use someone for their money? And those are BIG lies. Call me crazy but he deserves to know he\u2019s being completely manipulated and used lol", "NTA, let him know ASAP. You'd be saving the man from further deception and financial harm.\n\nEdit:  If your other family members are so concerned about your mom, then they should take her in or pay for her.

Why don\u2019t they take her in if they would feel so bad for her?! i think as long as it doesn\u2019t put your younger siblings in a bad spot, you should do it. It is the right thing to do.", "NTA. It\u2019s a pretty savage move, but any guy deserves to know this. One thing to take into consideration\u2026if your mom doesn\u2019t have $ to move with, you what will the negative impact be to your siblings? Do those impacts outweigh telling this guy what is going on?", "Your mom catfishing this guy so hard and it's sad that other members of the family are enabling her, they don't want you to tell him cause she will jump up and down in the boat and make waves for other people and they don't want to get wet.

But yikes your mom sounds like a mess.", "No. You would NBTA. your aunts need to stop enabling your mothers fraudulent behaviour and not blame you if mum lost the house because of HER actions. Also, if I was the guy, I would want to know as well before I give all my money away to a bad cause..", "Tell him. Your mother loves to use people. That needs to stop.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m the same age as your mom. No kids. \n\nPlease tell him. I\u2019d be horrified to be in a situation where my SO has been elaborately lying about their life.", "If this is all true, YWNBTA. But my gosh, your mom is starring in her own telenovela.", "NTA, sounds like your aunt forgot that normal people don't scam others for money, they work like everyone else", "NTA tell em dude is doing this for all the wrong reasons.", "NTA. \n\nNormally, I\u2019d say the opposite, because it\u2019s not really anyone else\u2019s place to tell him, but she\u2019s a straight up conwoman. He has a right to know the correct number of children/grandchildren he\u2019d have if they got married, that your bio dad isn\u2019t a deadbeat, and that the woman he\u2019s dating is 20 years older than him instead of 8. \n\nA relationship built on lies is no relationship at all, and any other truths she\u2019s keeping from him are just digging her own grave when he eventually finds out, whether it\u2019s by being told or by himself.
