Totally fair, my family did this years ago... we just do presents for the kids.\n\nYTA for the timing and approach, and your reasoning. Because this all did kick off because of the stepchildren specifically and you did admit that it's because you just don't really feel much for them. You just signalled your whole family that you were willing to spend money on your nieces and neohews but draw the line at the stepsiblings. I had a relative who excluded some of my siblings because they were \"step\" to her... it didn't go well. Her legacy decades after death is a lot to do with having been a dick to half my family.\n\nDude, they're kids navigating a new, blended family. You're an adult. It is REALLY not hard to be nice to kids at Christmas, and there are lots of very inexpensive but thoughtful ways to give them something to say, happy Christmas kid, we see you, you're part of the family. The feelings can grow over time but a good start is nice gestures like welcoming them abd giving them a little something for Christmas. Cut the budget somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, giving gifts is voluntary.  If the expense of having to buy for more and more and more every year starts to break the bank, you have to put your foot down and draw the line somewhere.  It's not fair for family members to expect you to go into debt in order to make a bunch of people you have only marginal contact with happy.\n\nIn my family, once we all got to the level where kids, grandkids, in-laws, etc. were mixed into the equation, we stopped the gift exchanges between the adults (with the exception of between spouses and direct parents and children) and got small gifts for the kiddos.  This brought everything under control so people weren't expected to buy individual gifts for dozens of people.  Even that many small gifts starts to add up.\n\nIf they want to call you cheap for that, simply opt out... tell them you expect nothing **from** them and they should expect nothing from you.  Christmas is supposed to be about family, love, and togetherness and not about how quickly you can spend yourself into credit hell in order to make sure everyone in your very extended family has one more gift to throw on what sounds like a rather large pile!", "NAH.  In this economy, I understand this. You could suggest that the adults just buy presents for the kids, and the Secret Santa is the adults.", "NTA.\n\nYour logic is sound.   I also agree with you.  \n\nIt also seems like he just wanted some extra free gifts for his kids. \n\nThat said, if I'm being generous here, I can kind of see his side as well.  Essentially, it sounds like he always bought gifts for the niece and nephew.  And they got gifts from the extended family.  Now that he has kids, people want to stop that tradition.   It would be kind of like if you bought gifts for everyone's housewarming, but by the time yours came along, everyone was broke and just decided to all chip in for a gift card or something. \n\nIts unfortunate that he is looking at this in the worst way possible.", "I remember that on Christmas only parents had some obligation to give big gifts to their own children, at least that was the way in our family, and maybe some relatives could bring something for the other kids but nothing big, just some cheap toy or candies, a box of cookies for the family or maybe a cake to share. \nI prefer to buy gifts for adults only, my own rule is that kids already have their parents and the whole thing around them, but that's me.\n\nNTA. A secret Santa sounds good enough for this situation if you're more into big gifts.", "What?! You're only planning on spending an extra $60!  I thought you were talking something more generous tbh... for the reaction.   You know Xmas isn't sprung on us a few weeks before right?  Like... it's been coming all year.  \n\n>From a moral standpoint- fair enough I guess\n\nThe \"I guess\" is more telling than you wish.  And hey... nice way to just fling morals out the door.  Pmsl.\n\n>its making christmas more if a stressor than a fun holiday\n\nNow actually,  isn't Xmas meant to be about family,  generosity,... family, generosity... shall I say it again?  Every family I know that is struggling economically makes things instead of buying them, realises Xmas is *for the kids* and makes sure the kids have the fun, only buy for kids,  brings the family together through food and games... etc.  \n\nYou're not just trying to save on $20 per kid.

But OP is fighting tooth and nail with anyone who is not saying they are NTA. \n\nNo, you shouldn't be expected to love them on the same level as the other children immediately, but not welcoming them into the family on Christmas of all days is a super shitty thing to do. It's the one holiday that is meant for coming together and being with family. If they are coming, they are family. \n\nThey don't have to give the new kids a super expensive toy, but they could also not get gifts for some of the adults so the kids, who are the ones that look forward to the holiday mainly FOR the gifts, get something nice. At least for the first year.", "Either they're a part of the family or they're not. \n\nTreating kids like second-class citizens because you don't have a blood relationship to them is an asshole move.", "You're right,  now I'm not sure either!   Lol.", "Exactly! It often feels like people with kids forget that childless people still exist during the holidays and still deserve to have a fun/special time of the year! Just because parents want to focus on their kids during the holidays doesn't mean that other adults should have to give up fun/special things for kids. Why can't everyone have a fun time filled with love!", "That\u2019s not how it works. They aren\u2019t immediately going to feel like family.", "It does make a difference though", "Exactly.  I've been thinking on it.  Difference between $60 and $180 (isn't it? ) is a lot.  And I've been thinking how that changes my underlying value.\n\nI guess I applaud Jack for being a good step dad and would like that rewarded.  So that's not important and shouldn't be rewarded if it's not affordable. \n\nI feel it's not really about money but about the kids.  So the amount is almost irrelevant but becomes a better excuse.   It's not like Jacks marriage wasn't coming up and kids couldn't have been budgeted in months earlier... if that was the problem.  \n\nAnd it's just that giving adults gifts at Xmas when money is tight seems strange to me when Xmas is all about the kids really. Gifts can be handmade and don't have to cost much to be meaningful and thoughtful. \n\nAnyway.... that's me thinking out loud again... I'm not arguing against you... please don't think that.  I usually write and think at the same time.", "My first thought was to also skip the adults for gifts and just focus on the kids.

It is much simpler", "I\u2019ll just say this we do a grab bag type game for adults. That can have any limit. \n\nThen for the kids every one buys for. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot to get them decent gifts. Sure if they are older they may be less appreciative, but whatever. We spend between five and ten dollars on one side of the family\u2019s kids. (They literally have everything, so no sense trying to find something new and we never really see them). We get them neat little things. Books, notebooks/coloring books, neat writing or drawing utensils, socks, puzzle, etc. I shop when things are clearance too, so I can get all of that for under 10$. \n\nEspecially for young kids you can make any budget work. If they are older kids you could always get them a book (I like to go to library book sales and there are many nice like new ones and they are a max of 2$ for hard cover), a soft blanket (you see plenty under ten dollars for every season), and a nice candy bar (bonus if it is their favorite). \n\n\nI don\u2019t think you are in wrong over this, but it was poor timing. Additionally I truly think you could make it work if you cared to; even if you just gave each child a stocking or bag filled with candy.", "NTA but can I make a suggestion? Can you get the kids a joint gift? Our family has a draw for adults (once you hit 18 you are considered an adult) but we buy gifts for the kids. I have 6, although only 3 are still under 18, while everyone else has one or two. We alway thought it was fair enough for my kids to share gifts, eg pool toys or board games. For the last few years, a couple of the families have teamed up to get our kids a Disney plus subscription. It is fanstastic.", "NTA this is why I strongly recommend making the big family get together at Thanksgiving (no gifts expected) and leaving Christmas open for the smaller family units to set their own traditions.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to be blunt. Tell them you can\u2019t afford it. Period. It\u2019s secret Santa, kids only or count you out. Their choice.", "NTA. My spouse has 8 siblings total. I do too on my side. Between the two of us there are 14 nieces and nephews on his side, and 15 nieces and nephews on mine. It's a lot of money. So on my side because my nieces and nephews are older we play secret Santa but with the nieces and nephews who are 12 and under we all just buy them gifts. On my spouse's side we pull names so for each family it would be the amount of kids we have. If you don't have kids you don't have to buy anything. For adults we just play white elephant. Everyone brings a gift and wraps it in white. We pull numbers and then we open gifts starting with one, people who come after you can steal your gift but if the gift has been stolen twice it's off the table. Honestly it's better to do it secret Santa style or white elephant, you get to give a more expensive gift to one person instead of spreading it over how ever many people there are. The only family members who get gifts from everyone are the grandparents/our parents. It's way more fun this way.", "NTA. What about doing just the kids? If the adults really want gifts do a secret Santa for the adults.", "I don't think any of your family are really aholes. Just make clear that all the kids will be included equally in whatever Christmas exchange the extended family does going forward, BUT there is no longer a commitment to provide a gift for every single adult and child.\n\nMany suggestions have been offered here, but it's important to recognize they are not perfect. Pick the top 3-5 that seem the most reasonable and tell your siblings and parents to all vote for the new tradition they would prefer. Allow your parents to set their own rules for their own giving (e.g., IF they prefer, they can still give every child a gift or even every adult and child a gift) because they have 'special status'.\n\nYour siblings need a chance to discuss what they like/don't like about different possibilities. What sounds great to the family with 3 kids sounds awful to the single adult. It's important to find the option that is most reasonable for your particular set of family members. And it's important to welcome the new kids into the extended family.", "NTA, I usually focus most of my Christmas budget on my nieces, and the adults each get an edible present. Some sort of treat I know they like. We all have too much stuff anyways.", "ESH. I completely understand wanting all children to get gifts. The first year I had a child was the year everyone stopped buying for all the kids and I was a tad irked about it since I was the last to have a child and had gifted thousands of dollars in gifts to them and my son was basically excluded from the gift exchange. However, adding four extra people to gift giving adds expenses not budgeted for. Perhaps a better solution would be to exclude adults and focus strictly on gifts for the kids.", "I have 4 kids, (3 with spouses) & 7 grandkids. It gets expensive. We get gifts for the grandkids. For the adults (and older teens if interested) we do a secret Santa (using elfster). One time we did the \u201csteal a gift or open a new one\u201d thing. One time we had everyone bring a wrapped gift, attached strings to all of them, put them in a large container & let everyone grab a string. The elfster thing has been the most popular. We can\u2019t afford to buy for everyone. The family has gotten too large.", "In my family of about 10-12 ppl on Christmas day, we have a pick-a-box. Every person buys 10 presents at $5 each present. \n\nThen they get wrapped with a raffle ticket put on top. The other half of the ticket goes into a basket. When everyone has drawn out the tickets, we have someone who goes through the gifts and calls out the numbers. You have the number you get that gift.\n\nBefore you unwrap it you can swap if someone else wants to swap too. It's really fun cos you never know what gifts you will get. \n\nMy family has done it for about 2 decades. It makes it cheaper and fun. You can be as imaginative or funny/gross as you can think up. \n\nThis year my family has a slight twist where everyone has a theme to shop for. I highly recommend it as it's really fun.", "NTA.  It might be better to do just the kids.  They love opening gifts.  We started doing that a drawing a name for the adults.", "\\^\\^ THIS.  \nNTA for suggesting the secret santa or to cut down on gifts, but definitely YTA for SAYING OUT LOUD TO YOUR BROTHER THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON HIS NEW FAMILY. That really sucked.\n\nOP, you could have just said that adding more people to the gift list was going to strain your budget, and you would either have to reduce the amount spent on each person, or the family could consider alternate gift ideas (like secret Santa, or $5 gifts only, or only the children get presents).
