Me and my MIL (mother in law) always had a rocky relationship. to keep the story short, his mom is a Narcissist. Everything is everyone else\u2019s fault, she can do no wrong. She even makes things up claiming you did things or said things that never happened. She hates the relationship I have with his dad and stepmom. I have numerous examples but it would make the post miles long. \n\nThe main point of this story is that my MIL has numerous health problems including but not limited to arthritis and MS (multiple sclerosis). She also has had multiple surgeries in the past couple years. She claims her son (my husband) has to come over weekly to help with with small tasks, (walking the dogs, changing cats litter box, organizing her medication, changing her diabetic sensor\u2026 etc). She can\u2019t do stairs, she can\u2019t bend over to pick things up, and some days she even needs a cane to walk around. Apparently when my husband brings my son over to her house (she refuses to come to ours because of our stairs and refusing to allow me over to her house (whole other story)) my husband has to hand my 2 year old son to her cause she can\u2019t lift him from the ground due to her MS and him being a big boy. \n\nwell about 9 months ago my sons nanny went on maternity leave and so i had my parents and my husbands dad and step mom take days to watch him weekly. example my parents got him monday-wednesday and his dad/stepmom got him thursday-friday just until the nanny came back. Well i told my husband not to tell his mom and let her assume my parents were going to watch him all week due to his mom\u2019s extreme hate towards his dad and stepmom. Well my husband did not listen and told her which i was right she was extremely mad then demanded that she wanted to have a day watching my son. (yes me and my husband do not get along anymore thanks to his mom\u2026 whole other story). I refused. I stated that there\u2019s no way she could watch him with her health issues. At the time my son was one years old walking around climbing stairs, and overall a clutz. I told my husband no because if our son fell and got hurt, his mom would not be able to pick him up and help him. my husband who always try\u2019s to make his mom happy saw nothing wrong with his mom watching him because it would make her happy and basically shut her up. After I stood my ground and still said no, he went to his mom claiming i said no because she would hurt him which is not what i said. when i confronted my husband he said \u201cwell it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d Now his mom is claiming i\u2019m the scum of the world constantly talking bad to my husband about me which is effecting me and my husbands relationship and she\u2019s going so far to spread lies about me. my husband likes to keep everything she says from me, but then tells his mom everything I say. \n\nBut I\u2019m wondering if I the asshole for not letting her watch my son some days just to appease her, even though she can\u2019t properly care for him with her health issues.", "created_utc": 1682090379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12u704f/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mil_to_watch_my_son/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should consider the next step in your relationship. The too long other stories tells me you are living a chaotic life.", "You need to tell him counseling or divorce.  See what he chooses", "Girl, you already are a single mom. If you divorce, at least you get child support.", "idk he loves to please his mom because she raised him to please her but he doesn\u2019t try to please anyone else.", "But if it goes to divorce, see if you can maintain the relationship with FIL and Step MIL. They seem like decent people."]}
