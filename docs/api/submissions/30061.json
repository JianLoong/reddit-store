I just said come when you want but that's the only time every one will be home. \n\nHe decided to  show up at 415pm and then only stayed for like 2 min. He handed each kid a big bag of candy.\n\nLater that evening, 14 was in the living room playing video games and eating candy. I didn't realize she was on the phone (she had it on speaker, laying down on the table, but wasn't really having a conversation just yelling at the game) so I just grabbed the bag of candy her dad gave her and started digging through it for Reece's  (she doesn't like them) \n\nShe says \"HEY THAT'S MY CANDY\"\n\n I said \"I am just stealing your Reece's cups.\"\n\n She said \"oh, okay just don't eat the Kit-Kats\"\n\nMy ex starts yelling on the phone saying \"I gave those to the kids, not YOU!!!  They are her candy!!\" \n\nI just ignored him, and 14 was like dad, I am not going to eat them, I don't like Reece's ..He kept saying I shouldn't eat their candy. 14 finally just hung up on him.\n\nSo AITA for only giving ex a small window to come over to give the kids candy, then  later eating my daughters Reece's cups, that her dad gave her?

You respected her wishes to not eat the Kit Kats. \n\nBut who raises someone that doesn\u2019t like Reese\u2019s???", "NTA - If your 14 year old doesn't like the Reeces cups, that is absolutely not a big deal.  And, you accommodated him as best you could last minute without making your children (who are old enough to have plans of their own) change their plans.  His lack of planning doesn't make YTA.", "NTA.  Ex is upset that your kids won't bend their lives around his schedule, lol. That's rich considering he never sees them.\n\nAnd yelling at you for eating candy? He's grasping for any control/say over you and your kids. Consequences of a delinquent parent kinda suck.\n\nIf he wants an actual relationship, he'll have to actually work for it not just show up a couple times a year. Even with an actual relationship he doesn't get to make demands of others.", "You didn\u2019t give him a small window, their activities gave him the small window. You told him to come when he wants. And then he didn\u2019t even stay very long. As far as the candy goes, your 14 year old said it was fine to eat the Reeces. I was expecting you to just hoard their candy. No nothing you did was wrong except not *ask* the 14 year old but since they were good when you explained, not really an asshole either. My ex and I always ate their candy because my kids wouldn\u2019t touch candy. They just liked going out.", "NTA, your ex doesn\u2019t even know what candy his kids like.", "NTA\n\nYour ex really has NO idea about the kids at all.  1) He calls 1 day ahead to visit the kids, 2) is upset that they have things to do (though he has given no notice) 3) He chose the time to come though you gave him a run down on  the kid's schedule 4) HE'S SO STOKED TO BRING A 17 & 18 yo a bag of Halloween candy 5) He actually is trying to tell his kid to eat the candy she doesn't like to spite you (or to show that if he bought it he can control who eats it) \n\nSo no NTA.", "NTA.

Sperm donor gets no say in everyday happenings in your home. What a piece of work.", "NTA. Those candies now belong to the 14yo so she gets to decide, and the dad shouldn't have any reason to throw a fit over some unwanted candies.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t give him a small window- you explained that given the short notice everyone had already made plans and that window of time was the only one available to see all the kids. This isn\u2019t limiting his ability to see his kids- it\u2019s dealing with the fact that he gave you absolutely no warning to be able to schedule time with them. Your kids are practically grown- he can\u2019t actually think they sit at home all day doing nothing. I\u2019m assuming he has their phone numbers and can get ahold of them on his own as well and could arrange time to see them if he actually cared to. \n\nAnd as far as the candy thing goes, good for your daughter for hanging up on him. Glad she\u2019s learning early not to put up with absolute BS.", "NTA. The window wasn't your creation, it was when all the kids were there. He ended up doing whatever he wanted to do, so he has no reason to complain. And once the candy is at your house, he has no say over who eats it. Your kid was fine with it, and that's all that matters. And what the hell is his problem making such a big fuss and then only staying for two minutes?", "NTA for the time window question. But even though you know that child doesn't like Reece's, you still should have asked if you could have some Reece's cups before just grabbing the bag and helping yourself.", "NTA- he\u2019s got some nerve acting like that when he\u2019s an absent father. 2-3 times a year isn\u2019t enough for you to take on that roll and attitude. And to only stay a few minutes after making a big fuss over wanting to come sooner? Boy is high. \n\nThen to have to gall to raise his voice to you as if he gave them gold and you stole all of it from your own children. What a child. I can\u2019t even believe grown ass humans act this way. You\u2019re not in the wrong and if you want to set boundaries you\u2019re more than allowed to. He\u2019s just mad when he snaps his fingers for something no one gives him what he wants. And frankly, it\u2019s not your job to. He can go talk to his momma like that if he wants to act like a baby.", "NTA - You gave him that window because all the kid's weren't going to be  there at other times. This wasn't just you trying to limit his time with him. And I mean she's not going to eat the reeces anyway, so why wouldn't you eat them instead of them going to the trash?", "NTA. You didn't give him a small window, you provided the information about when your kids would be home. Since he decided to make last minute plans and not be available when they all were, HE gave HIMSELF a small window.", "NTA \n\nyou gave him plenty of options, and he didn't take advantage of any of them as much as he could. Sounds like a bum trying to convince the kids you're the problem", "Seriously? Those kids are old enough for him to reach out and set a time to see them himself! (Unless he needs supervision that is) not your job to fit the kids into a schedule for him. Also sir everyone pays taxes, your kid will survive.", "You didn\u2019t give him a small window. That\u2019s just when everyone was home. NTA, how is that possibly your fault?", "INFO: Why do they rarely see their father, and why don't you want him to stay longer?

Dad can be mad all he wants that you at the Reese's, but that doesn't change the fact that he doesn't know what his kids like. Reeses are like the #1 halloween candy, your 14 yo not liking them would be pretty obvious.", "Is dad on drugs?", "NTA. This is a non-problem.", "NTA, I think it\u2019s hilarious that your 14 year old already knows how to deal with his bs. I feel like you didn\u2019t have to come here for this but something was eating at you. You are by no means the ah. He just wants to be mad at you for something and is grabbing at anything he can.", "Are you the AH?!?! Even 14 hung up on that nonsense. \n\nThat's hilarious", "NTA. I understand why he is an ex. Good for you to end that marriage. I bet that Reese's tasted wonderful.", "You didn't give him a small window. You told him when your kids were all around. What are you going to order your 18 year old to visit with their dad they probably barely care about at this point for some candy? NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nI  mean you even explained when the kids would all be home.  That's not your fault.  They have lives they live and that's when they all would be available.  He wants to see the kids he needs to adhere to their schedule.  Not them bend around to accommodate him.  Then he didn't even stay long so it would've been pointless for the kids to change all they were doing for him. \n\nAnd the candy thing... he needs to get over it.  She wasn't going to eat the ones you were getting.   He sounded real childish.", "NTA you told him when your teens were available. They\u2019re teens they have plans you can\u2019t control that. Also your child can share her candy with you he is just being a petty AH", "Your ex stayed 2 minutes after all that? Christ. Yeah, he really cares about the kids so much his love manifested into bags of candy. That's why he didn't want you to eat any of it.", "NTA - if he\u2019s close enough to drop off candy he should see them for than 2-3 times a year. \n\nAlso who cares if you get some candy. They\u2019re going to get so much candy and cannot just eat it all that\u2019s insane.", "How is this even a topic of discussion? If he gives the kids meth can you take it away from them? Whether he gave it to them or not doesn't matter. And he needs to understand that just because he wants to come and see the kids he can't expect the kids to rearrange their lives and schedules to see him. He needs to plan ahead of time and be an adult and stop thinking about himself. Also he should know 14 doesn't like reeces. \n\nAlso 14 shouldn't be yelling at you for eating the candy anyway. You provide their whole well being and necessity, it's not like new candy can't be bought.", "You'd be the asshole if he wasn't already an asshole and even then... kid doesn't like that kind of candy so should be fair game to whoever eats it that and the fact he doesn't know his own kids likes and dislikes makes him the asshole.", "NTA\n\nAnd furthermore, this post gives off a kind of smug vibe so I'm pretty sure you know damn well you didn't do anything wrong.", "EH honestly they're old enough to talk to him and give him their availability unless it depends on your transportation", "NTA- he's a prick.", "Honestly, this is a divorce. There isn't nearly enough information here to determine if you're TA. My father basically abandoned me and my siblings this same way. Hated him most of my life.

You should not be rummaging through their candy.  You should be asking if there is something you want and they should feel free to say no.  It doesn't matter if you know they do not like it.  Maybe they would rather trade or give the candy to a sibling or friend.  Instead you just assume it is yours.  It isn't.  It was a gift to them.

Just from the post alone i would assume that maybe the reason he wanted to come earlier in the day to hang out is that he had something in the evening, which is why he only stayed for 2 minutes after previously saying he wanted to stay a while. But obviously there\u2019s not quite enough context to know like how he usually acts what your status quo is, etc etc. the only thing I would suggest is maybe better communication, it sounds like the initial conversation between you guys was somewhat hostile.

His children having plans and him not asking about it did.\n\nAlso, you taking candy your child DOESN'T EVEN LIKE is completely okay.

I do the same thing you do; I know what they don\u2019t like, and I\u2019ll grab a piece if I know for a fact that they don\u2019t like that one (though this would NEVER happen with a Reese\u2019s *anything* with my kids. I could maybe steal a twizzler, at best \ud83e\udd23). \n\nWhen I give my kids candy (Christmas, Easter, Halloween, etc) I do it knowing full well their mother is going to get some of it, and it doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ll even occasionally throw a coconut egg in there, knowing full well that NONE of my kids will touch it but she\u2019ll be excited for it. \n\nNTA.
