By saying you have it easy, they perceive it as a slight against their value, and with your wife saying that they considered you smug, that's probably how they took it. \n\nWhich is nonsense.

What that woman said about going back to work outside of home was \"easy\" is insulting to you, to your way of life, to stay-at-home-dads in general. It's building on the idea that fathers find difficult to take care of their children and prefer to leave these tasks to their wives. This woman needs to think seriously about how she considers fathers and taking care of children.\n\nHowever, your wife's reaction is weird.

This is a symptom of people who stay at home and parent having a chip on their shoulder about it. It's super common. It derives from a faulty assumption that paid work is inherently better and more valuable than unpaid work at home, and therefore in order to compete it's necessary to act as though unpaid house work is the hardest thing ever in order to be as valuable as paid work. Note this is regardless of the individual's experience in doing it (OP's wife found it hard and that's fine, I'm talking about the impression people give to others socially here).\n\nSocially, people will present their SAH work as the hardest worst thing in the world, and how they're just itching to get back to the paid workplace where everything is so much easier.

Sooner or later they\u2019re gonna grow up and the opportunity to spend time with them will be gone.  I don\u2019t see the need to beat around the bush about how you feel.

We are both single and child-free (out of choice).\n\nI'm good with managing the home, cleaning up, setting it up etc. She's good with handling the outdoor stuff - dealing with the handymen, services etc.\n\nEvery time she moved due to a job or other things, I would setup her home, do the unpacking, organize everything. Every time she comes over she handles all my insurance stuff, CA, bank accounts etc. If major work needs to be done in either of our places - she does the negotiation and buying the raw material etc. I supervise the work at home. \n\nWe are symbiotic and we both appreciate the value of the help given to each other.", "Simple truth. When you love it, and you are good at it, it is much easier for you then it is for someone who doesn't and isn't.", "Probably going to be downvoted to low hell for this but, I would be so happy if people stopped saying things like this. Along with \u201cdo what you love and it\u2019ll never feel like work\u201d. It\u2019s simply not true. Loving something will not magically make a hard task easy, it just makes it worth it.\n\nOP happens to find being a SAHP easy, nowhere in the post even does he say he loves doing it. He simply says compared to his office job it\u2019s easier.", "no they are mad because they thought he made it seems like what they do is such a cake-walk.  Basically they have built themselves up as supermom's for being SAHPs and it stings when told what they do isn't as hard as they are making it out to be.", "My child (now 13) was born after 3 hours of labor, only the last of which was in the hospital. The doctor said push once and a head appeared. A second time and a baby appeared. Perfect apgar scored. My child had no problems latching on for nursing, and had their first newborn BM within 20 minutes of the first feeding. No one needed stitches, or much after-care, no medications... We all walked out of the hospital the next day.\n\nPeople *hate* that story, lol.\n\nFeel free to share your wonderful experience with me, idm :)", "I thought going from manual labor to a more corporate job to plan for kids (better pay and hours) was going to be easier. Oh how wrong I was. Instead of being worried about stepping on a nail or climbing up that ladder alone because crew was short, it became teammates that slacked off, skipped out, didn't know shit, and left messes everywhere because they choose to be miserable human beings.\n\nThe toddlers with jelly on their hands and grabbing at the keyboard while I finish up a work email are like that because they're still learning and it's just cute when they do it. Also zero complaints from me when they decide to nap lol", "Yeah I'll take stepping on the ninja lego and having a messy kid on my lap for 5 minutes while I finish an email over risking stepping on another nail, or team of associates who are messy and fuck off all day because they choose to versus being toddlers that are just learning, any day of the week.", "Entirely depends on the child you get. Mine is an \u201ceasy\u201d baby, but boy when she\u2019s teething or gets sick I\u2019m just wiped. Both of us work full time though and she just upped her daycare days from 2 to 4 (don\u2019t ask how we did it, still not sure). So while childcare might not be the most difficult thing, combined with modern life, jobs and expectations from parents it\u2019s pretty darn hard.", "\"oh I just know you're itching to get back to having it easy\"\n\nI think actually you'll find it was the friend who was making assumptions and not empathising where he was coming from.\n\nWhat if he had an awful manual labour job with a team who didn't support him, but was steady income?", "It\u2019s not like he corrected them when they said \u201cI find being an at home parent easy.\u201d They asked him a question and he answered. \n\nIt would be ridiculous to ask someone a question and expect them to only answer in ways they think will make you feel good.", "What about people with jobs?

I mean it can always be a cakewalk, you must sometimes get to then end of a week with them utterly and mentally drained?

And given this post, I think parenting is probably the easiest demonstration of that concept.", "When I was doing construction it wasn't unheard of to find nails and screws in the soles of our boots. I had a nail stuck in the sole once and for two days couldn't figure out why it felt weird whenever I stepped. Didn't punch all the way through thank goodness.

I'm with you on the whole in-home chaos is better than manual labor thing, but I'd think these particular incidents it's not!\n\nA nail that you only noticed cause it \"felt weird\" doesn't hurt, but stepping down on a lego-fig *inside* your shoe, yowch! \n\nYou have my sympathies, lol", "explain wha type of physical labor and explain how its harder then any other type of physical  labor", "I have a special needs kid who required so many visits (OT, sensory stuff, etc) that comes with a ridiculous amount of coordination (and expense!). She\u2019s doing much better but I still have to drive 45 minutes each way twice a day to get her to the school that is best for her development. It\u2019s a f*%^ing pita. I work now as a nurse and sometimes those 12.5 hour days on your feet are easier than what I dealt with when my girl was little. It\u2019s a different type of exhaustion. \n\nAnyway, everyone\u2019s experience is different.

However im talking about the average women with kids around the ages of 7-12 who complain when all they really have to do is send the kid to school and clean the house\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit from the sounds of it it seems like what you had to do was way harder then an office job.", "Well, once they are 7-12 (barring any complications) it does get much easier. I think most people are talking about baby and toddler stage. Sounds like OP has at least one toddler.\n\nMy whole point is\u2026we never know what other people are dealing with and we should approach things with empathy and humility. It is probably the only thing that I have learned from my daughter and the experience of raising her. I think this applies to OP and the women he was talking to."]}
