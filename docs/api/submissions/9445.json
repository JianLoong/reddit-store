We had our first kid but she didn't do too well being the stay-home and had a hard time with it. We still wanted our kids to have a parent at home with them so we swapped out since her salary was close to mine. Two kids later I'm still the stay-at-home dad working reduced hours remotely. For me personally, it's easier than any job I've had in the past, even the manual labor one but I recognize that that's just my personal experience. We've touched base on the issue a few times to make sure there's no resentment, guilt, or discomfort on either of our parts.\n\nOne of her friends from her work invited us and other couples over for dinner. While there, the other couples were talking about childcare in general and some of the women started sharing their experiences of when they were home. My wife was talking about how she had disliked it and mentioned our arrangement when one of the women said to me: \"Oh I know you're just itching to get back to having it easy.\"\n\nI responded that I already have it easy and that for me, being a stay-at-home dad was a cakewalk compared to my office job. I didn't see the point in agreeing with something that just isn't true for me. On the way home my wife asked why couldn't I have just agreed with the question and played along. I asked her if she felt bad or guilty that she had a hard time with it and she said no, so I told her to just forget about it then because there's no reason for me to lie to make a bunch of other people feel better so long as it's fine between us. When she got home from work yesterday she had some attitude asking me if I had 'another easy peasy day' and told me how all day she had to hear from her friends what a smug asshole I was for making light of their experiences by saying it was a cakewalk. I get that for a lot of people it's hard but I don't see why I should have to lie about it or fluff someone's ego for not feeling the same way.\n\nAITA?\n\nAdditional info: The scheduling, making appointments, taking kids where they need to be, grocery list, school stuff, making sure payments for bills came out, vehicle maintenance, organizing our date nights, finding babysitters, figuring out what needs to be done- falls on me.

You had no previously arranged reason to spin a tale or choose your words carefully.\n\nNTA. \n\nThat said, there seems to be a fairly common social tedium about the virtuous labor of being a house-parent / house-mother. Setting aside the realities of the challenges, as they will vary from home to home, people seem to set a great store by how hard they work and how hard they struggle. \n\nI have found that in most cases, when we say something comes easily to us, other people interpret it as a devaluation of their worth, since they've invested so much in the value of their 'struggle.' By saying you have it easy, they perceive it as a slight against their value, and with your wife saying that they considered you smug, that's probably how they took it. \n\nWhich is nonsense. It's not your obligation to coddle others, nor should you bend yourself into knots to find diplomatic wording. \n\nBut you might find it easier, to avoid tedious situations like this, to focus not on the 'ease or difficulty,' but on the 'reward' and how happy being a home-father makes you.", "NTA. some people struggle with being a homemaker.

Your experience being easy doesn't invalidate it feeling difficult for them.", "NTA. You are happy being a SAHD. Great! What that woman said about going back to work outside of home was \"easy\" is insulting to you, to your way of life, to stay-at-home-dads in general. It's building on the idea that fathers find difficult to take care of their children and prefer to leave these tasks to their wives. This woman needs to think seriously about how she considers fathers and taking care of children.\n\nHowever, your wife's reaction is weird. You say you communicate about the equilibrium of your way of life, but is it possible she's suffering pressure at work about going back to work instead of taking care of her children?", "NTA. They decided to take offense because you like parenting more than the office job you had. They could have been like, \"damn, how hellish was his office, how mismatched was he for his job/company that tyrannical toddlers is a cake walk?\" Plenty of people have day jobs easier than parenting and plenty of offices are hell.

You stated your experience, no need to lie about it. \n\nMy husband and I actually had a similar experience, I hated my mat leave, and only lasted the full year (go Canada!) because my husband was just short of hours so didn\u2019t qualify. I was more than ready to go back after 6 months. At the end of the year, I happily went back to work, and he became the stay at home dad. And we stayed like that until after my son started school. He loved being home, and never struggled with it the way I did. \n\nSome people love being at home parents, and some don\u2019t. Nothing is wrong with either opinion or experience.", "NTA. This is a symptom of people who stay at home and parent having a chip on their shoulder about it. It's super common. It derives from a faulty assumption that paid work is inherently better and more valuable than unpaid work at home, and therefore in order to compete it's necessary to act as though unpaid house work is the hardest thing ever in order to be as valuable as paid work. Note this is regardless of the individual's experience in doing it (OP's wife found it hard and that's fine, I'm talking about the impression people give to others socially here).\n\nSocially, people will present their SAH work as the hardest worst thing in the world, and how they're just itching to get back to the paid workplace where everything is so much easier. OP doesn't experience that so didn't agree. OP shouldn't have to lie about it, and OP's wife's friends shouldn't judge their self worth based on how easy OP has it at home.", "NTA at all. Why do people do this? Just because you have a bad experience means I must have as well? And then they get mad when you say everything is great!\n\nNothing pissed me off more than when people asked how MY childbirth experience was and I honestly told them all the positives (because I had a wonderful experience) then I would be talked down to because other parents had to share their horrible experience with me.

For some being a SAP is the goal, for others a nightmare. For some it\u2019s hard, but equally, for some people employment is hard and depressing. \n\nThey decided to use their experiences to make an assumption about how you feel. That they\u2019re wrong is their issue. You don\u2019t have to agree with things that aren\u2019t true - would your wife agree if somebody was making an assumption like \u201coh you must be unhappy being the breadwinner and missing out on that time with your children\u201d \n\nIf you and your wife are happy with the arrangement and it lets you raise your children and find balance in your home - that is what matters.", "NTA \n\nI hate when parents try to make parenting a competition.

Some people find running a kitchen really easy, some of us would make a disaster of it. \n\nEveryone has different skills, and experiences.. Speaking your truth, when asked, is never an asshole move.", "NTA.  \n\nWe (men and women) all deal with things differently. \n\nLet\u2019s call it what it is, I\u2019d pick taking care of my kid every day over manual labor (e.g., car mechanic, construction worker, etc.) 100% of the time. I\u2019m good at it, but if I had to choose between that and being a stay at home father, I\u2019d be a stay at home father.  \n\nI happily choose to be peed or pooped  over a job where I am basically in a dangerous/life threatening situation half of my day. I can clean up poop and pee quickly, but I can\u2019t regrow a broken leg in an hour. Don\u2019t even get me started on the back and joint pain that I\u2019ll have for the rest of my life or working outside when it\u2019s 100 or 30 degrees out. \n\nNo offense to anyone out there, this is just my personal opinion. Raising kids is hard, but it\u2019s not the hardest job out there.  I agree that it\u2019s a cakewalk compared to my job. \n\nAlso, good for you man!  Enjoy them while you can. Sooner or later they\u2019re gonna grow up and the opportunity to spend time with them will be gone.  I don\u2019t see the need to beat around the bush about how you feel.

And it\u2019s okay.", "NTA. \n\nYou can have different opinions than someone else and express those opinions without being an AH. \n\nOn the flip-side - why aren\u2019t her friends AHs for saying that working a full time job is \u201ctaking it easy\u201d? That feels much ruder than you saying that being a stay at home parent hasn\u2019t been that hard for you.", "NTA. The experience of SAHD is important to share! Ty for sharing", "NTA because you said for you that's your experience. \n\nThis is one of the things I find frustrating about some social groups. I think it could be an interesting discussion to have but more often people want to just commiserate or validate, not actually hear other experiences.", "NTA - I think the key is that you said \"For me,...\" which isn't discounting their experience and making it very clear that you're just sharing yours. \n\nI don't agree with other commenters saying people don't recognize a real challenge or the 'modern woman syndrom' (yikes). I think it's all of us recognizing that every experience is different and every person's perception of that experience is different as well.", "NTA. You were being honest.", "NTA. Though I get why your wife may be responding the way she is, you're still not the asshole.", "NTA, you should never lie to make others feel better", "NTA\n\nI mean your previous job was physical labor, like no shit you prefer being a stay-home dad.", "NTA with a gentle \u201cmaybe it would have been more socially acceptable to read the room and not go so far\u201d vibe.  I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to outright lie to people and say that it\u2019s difficult and you\u2019re dying to get back to working a full time office job for example.  Obviously we\u2019re all Monday morning quarter backing here, but replying something like \u201cactually, I really enjoy my role as a stay at home parent, and find that for me it\u2019s much less stressful than any job I\u2019ve had previously\u201d would have been received a bit better.  I think it may have been the \u201cI already have it easy\u201d that set some of the coworkers off?  \n\nEither way, I think they need to calm down.

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, just maybe an explanation for their string reaction.

Domestic labor is stereotypically undervalued because it is unpaid and there is a perception that the parent (usually the mother) stays home. Accordingly, a counternarrative (another stereotype) emerges that stay at home parents have to work *really hard* without recognition, such that parenting work shouldn't be taken lightly. Also, there is a gendered perception that *work* is easier for men and *home* is easier for women; think of the image of the overstressed working mom or the incompetent stay-at-home dad, the idea that moms parent but dads \"babysit,\" and other things.

Remember that you may be taking care of a newborn, but you aren\u2019t dealing with the tidal wave of hormones, possible PPD, healing, etc. that those women were doing while taking care of a newborn.

Women have come a lot way since our grandmothers couldn't have their own bank accounts, but that is still in living memory, and that means women (who don't themselves come from a background that rejects that progress) can be very aware and may experience stress over the fact that women putting themselves in the position of being financially dependent on their husband's income are vulnerable to abuse. And the way misogyny has sort of swung right around and women who stay at home can be accused of leeching or being gold diggers (even when simultaneously women who go back to work experience shaming for not being there for their kids)... when you say \"it's a cakewalk,\" even just in a group of women, they hear it from a place where they likely feel if they expressed those same sentiments, they'd be asked why they can't *both* work and be a full-time mom.\n\nRecognize that you do live in a society where the idea that being a stay at home parent is easy is weaponized against individual women, and against societal issues like maternity leave, ect.\n\nIt's also not unlikely that their husbands don't contribute as much to parenting and the rest of the work at home (cooking/cleaning/ect) as your wife does. How much she contributes might be something to acknowledge next time you find yourself in a position of discussing how much you enjoy being a parent. Adding on something like, \"and my wife has been a huge help, we split everything 50/50 during her off hours and she takes care of them on weekends so I can do some part-time work in my field,\" or whatever would be a more accurate description of your particular situation could also go a long way to not sounding dismissive of SAHMs.\n\nNAH.", ">I responded that I already have it easy and that for me, being a stay-at-home dad was a cakewalk compared to my office job. \n\nYou're not wrong, but you had a chance to make yourself *and* your wife look good.

Dropping down to part time removed some of the most burdensome office work, and while it was replaced with parenting and homemaking responsibilities, I value what I build at home.

The most challenging moments were when they were newborns, and for me, those times passed quickly. I also look at it as the helpless years don't last long. Eventually, and pretty quickly with how fast kids grow, they'll be more independent. At that point its about balancing discipline with support, giving them enough freedom to grow and just trying to guide them to make good moral decisions.\n\nMy personal opinion, I think individual personalities, priorities, and expectations play a big part of it.

However if we are talking about a velcro baby i would have to agree with you. as long as we are talking about an average office in the Usa", "Maybe it's just me having Autism but what's so wrong with being blunt and just saying the truth. I didn't take OP's wording as arrogant, more down to earth and chill and telling it how it is.", "Yeah, my friends who were able and wanted to do SAHP acknowledge that those who do the work and parenting combo have a full plate. And those who could do SAHP but like to get to the office say the SAHP is tough. Honestly, we shouldn't make it into a misery Olympics. Everyone will have their struggles and should be supportive; the whole I-have-it-so-much-harder isn't very constructive. The women with OP wanted validation that their lives are sooo much harder than those who go to the office. It's just weird.", "Agreed.  The others weren't diplomatic about what they thought.  Why does OP have to be the only one being diplomatic?", "People don't want the truth, they want comfort so you either sugarcoat your truth or play along. One if the several ways socializing can be tiring, people are naturally insecure and this reflects on conversation.", "I think SAHP parents simply need to acknowledge that the simple fact that they *can* stay at home at all is a huge privilege that happens because someone else is paying the bills for them and they are financially well off enough to be able to do that, and that millions of people of all genders don\u2019t have that same privilege.\n\nIt does not even have so much to do with who has it harder Olympics, but it\u2019s simply an objective fact that if running a household and childcare requires a certain amount of tasks *of course* that is going to be objectively much easier if you are home all day long to complete them than completing the exact same tasks in the much shorter time after work. I can\u2019t believe that this is even controversial and not super obvious.", "I work in child care, it\u2019s a job I love. The amount of times I have been treated, and called a glorified babysitter is outrageous. Are there jobs harder than mine, absolutely; can anyone properly care, and help develop 5 infants, absolutely not. I have been working this job for almost 18 years, I have a degree, I also get new training yearly.", "I\u2019m 46 without kids and I still ask myself the same question", "I wouldn't call it a privilege for everyone.\n\nI'm saying this as someone who's stuck at home because we'd be financially in a worse place if I went back, due to childcare, transportation costs, and higher taxes, and the flexibility I'd need to manage our children. We're right on that cusp where we make too much to get help and yet, not enough to not need helpa0\n\nOne person's privilege is another person's prison.\n\nI'm not able to build my career or build up a retirement. My stability if something happens to my husband is extremely impacted.", "I feel this. When I opened my home daycare I stepped away from being a teacher, a school counselor, and working in business. I had been successful in all 3, had a masters degree, and yet I wasn\u2019t happy. But I *was* happy with the little ones, teaching them language, cooking healthy food, and singing songs. Not only ABC\u2019s and 123\u2019s, colors, and shapes, but yoga, Spanish, and emotional intelligence. People have zero idea what you do and what I did. The paperwork from the State and Federal government alone for home daycares would make most people quit."]}
