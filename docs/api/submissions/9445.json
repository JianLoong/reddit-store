By saying you have it easy, they perceive it as a slight against their value, and with your wife saying that they considered you smug, that's probably how they took it. \n\nWhich is nonsense.

What that woman said about going back to work outside of home was \"easy\" is insulting to you, to your way of life, to stay-at-home-dads in general. It's building on the idea that fathers find difficult to take care of their children and prefer to leave these tasks to their wives. This woman needs to think seriously about how she considers fathers and taking care of children.\n\nHowever, your wife's reaction is weird.

This is a symptom of people who stay at home and parent having a chip on their shoulder about it. It's super common. It derives from a faulty assumption that paid work is inherently better and more valuable than unpaid work at home, and therefore in order to compete it's necessary to act as though unpaid house work is the hardest thing ever in order to be as valuable as paid work. Note this is regardless of the individual's experience in doing it (OP's wife found it hard and that's fine, I'm talking about the impression people give to others socially here).\n\nSocially, people will present their SAH work as the hardest worst thing in the world, and how they're just itching to get back to the paid workplace where everything is so much easier.

Sooner or later they\u2019re gonna grow up and the opportunity to spend time with them will be gone.  I don\u2019t see the need to beat around the bush about how you feel.

Domestic labor is stereotypically undervalued because it is unpaid and there is a perception that the parent (usually the mother) stays home. Accordingly, a counternarrative (another stereotype) emerges that stay at home parents have to work *really hard* without recognition, such that parenting work shouldn't be taken lightly. Also, there is a gendered perception that *work* is easier for men and *home* is easier for women; think of the image of the overstressed working mom or the incompetent stay-at-home dad, the idea that moms parent but dads \"babysit,\" and other things.

Women have come a lot way since our grandmothers couldn't have their own bank accounts, but that is still in living memory, and that means women (who don't themselves come from a background that rejects that progress) can be very aware and may experience stress over the fact that women putting themselves in the position of being financially dependent on their husband's income are vulnerable to abuse. And the way misogyny has sort of swung right around and women who stay at home can be accused of leeching or being gold diggers (even when simultaneously women who go back to work experience shaming for not being there for their kids)... when you say \"it's a cakewalk,\" even just in a group of women, they hear it from a place where they likely feel if they expressed those same sentiments, they'd be asked why they can't *both* work and be a full-time mom.\n\nRecognize that you do live in a society where the idea that being a stay at home parent is easy is weaponized against individual women, and against societal issues like maternity leave, ect.\n\nIt's also not unlikely that their husbands don't contribute as much to parenting and the rest of the work at home (cooking/cleaning/ect) as your wife does. How much she contributes might be something to acknowledge next time you find yourself in a position of discussing how much you enjoy being a parent. Adding on something like, \"and my wife has been a huge help, we split everything 50/50 during her off hours and she takes care of them on weekends so I can do some part-time work in my field,\" or whatever would be a more accurate description of your particular situation could also go a long way to not sounding dismissive of SAHMs.\n\nNAH.", ">I responded that I already have it easy and that for me, being a stay-at-home dad was a cakewalk compared to my office job. \n\nYou're not wrong, but you had a chance to make yourself *and* your wife look good.

I completely agree with you", "I find it easy, I was miserable at work. My SIL is the opposite. She had to stay home for a year and she was miserable, it just wasn\u2019t for her.

She started a home-based bookkeeping business, because she had that much free time and was bored (she was a bookkeeper before we had kids).  Now all the house stuff she takes care of gets done, and she's pulling in a few thousand extra per month on top.", "I think the real issue here is that things are only seen as valuable if they are hard to do. You\u2019re only worth something if you\u2019re slaving away, so the only way to feel any worth as a STAHP is to have it seem to be hard work, not because it\u2019s enjoyable or anything like that. It\u2019s so sad.", "Did this women also feel pressure to \"get back in the office\"? The conversation sounds like they were home when they had newborns, maybe even toddlers. OP sounds like 3 kids and at least some of then are in school part time. He's currently at a fun stage in my eyes. I also think that the way they asked the question is telling, itching to get back to the office? Why? It sounds like they are jealous that they don't have a parent who can go to school pick up, deal with a sick kid, etc without their world being flipped. Your wife is the breadwinner and I hope she stands up proud of that instead of taking heat from her coworkers. Maybe she needs reassurance from you that you appreciate she goes to the office and she is able to provide for your family and the choices you have made together.", "LOL.\n\nMy child homeschooled through the entire pandemic, only returning to school this year. And we'd experimented with homeschool before. With me working from home, pretty much always.\n\nWe never had any behavior problems, no chaos, everything was just lovely. \n\nMy usual viewpoint is that all kids, all parents, and all families are different. And I don't typically fault someone for having a harder time.\n\nBut I dare someone to comment something nasty because I didn't struggle, like at that point I'll actually say \"it's not my fault I'm better at this than you.\"\n\nCause I wasn't judging, but if you want to treat me like I was, then I will, tbh.\n\n(Yes, I'm proudly an AH in those instances, and do not care.

Appointments, taking oldest to school and picking her up, packing her lunch, checking to make sure all the bills are paid, organizing our date night for the week, finding out which of our parents is going to babysit, on me. I do the majority of the housework/yardwork, shovel snow now that it's winter, do all of the cooking 5 days a week, and spread 25 hours of remote work Mon-Sat. Once in a while, we do meal prep together on a weekend, and grocery shopping is always done together on the weekend.", "He is not an asshole for answering honestly.  If I ask someone if I look fat to them, and they say yes, then they aren\u2019t assholes. I asked for their opinion.

Doesn't mean I'm in a rush to stop being a stay-at-home parent, especially not for something 'easier' as she suggested.

My youngest just turned 3 and I\u2019m looking forward to next year when he doesn\u2019t try to shove things up his nose, uses the potty every single time, doesn\u2019t try to touch hot things or do backwards somersaults on furniture but this is still light years better than the first or second year. School age kids are cake. I homeschool mine but when school work is done, they run off to their rooms, the backyard or the playroom. So easy.", "people only respect you if you are miserable", "I *love* my job. I've still had two complete mental breakdowns over it.", "I feel like love is what takes the stress out of dealing with a difficult task, which is like a majority of what makes something feel easy or hard. I enjoy problem solving so hunting down a programming bug on a tight deadline doesn't feel as difficult compared to networking at a work event even though it's objectively easier because I find networking to be stressful.\n\nLike how in parenting dealing with your own child's boogers is easier than someone else's child. Both scenarios are objectively the same but since you love your child it's less gross.", "Think you missed my point. Love doesn't automatically erase difficultly.

But initially you presented it as a universal fact. Imagine someone who loves what they do but still struggle, who then runs into your claim.", "It\u2019s definitely physical labor intertwined with mental labor. When you\u2019re constantly doing both it can get tiring.  It\u2019s not harder than all physical labor but to think any physical labor is always harder than taking care of children is ridiculous.", "You know they aren\u2019t born with the skill of walking, right? You do everything for a baby, including clipping tiny nails and bathing and changing nappies and feeding and taking for a walk\u2026 Breastfeeding is another pretty physical task, and god forbid you get a contact napper, I have cooked with a baby strapped to my chest.

After you clean up the toy you played with \\[e.g. blocks\\], you can play with something else.  No cleanup?  No other toys to play with.  Kids pick this up quite quickly and easily before age 2.

Your choice.  \\[This from mother who raised 6 and grandmother with 4 who visit and stay overnight frequently.\\]", "To me, I think it's better to just let people sat what they want unless they are hurtful or mean.
