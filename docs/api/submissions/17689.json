You can clarify she was adopted, but I don't see why if it's finalized you are still calling her your foster daughter.

My bio daughter was 23 and planning on moving out in 2 months so she slept on the couch to make room because we wanted them together.", "Yeah I'm not buying this unless the person that said that to OP is extremely old school. This has been a known fact since the late 90s and was even discussed with my parents in the early 90s as a possibility when they adopted me.", "They are abusing her, and she will outright hate them for it. \n\nShe's not going to get over this. She has a HIGH risk of being a runaway because of OP's actions.\n\nOMG I'm so fucking livid I can't even see straight. \n\nWho the HELL are these people?!??!?!?!?", "She is going to DESPISE these people forever.\n\nShe will cut ties the second she turns 18, 100% guaranteed, assuming she doesn't run away before then.", "I\u2019m adopted too and and also a lawyer. OP is being awful.  I highly doubt that there is a court order preventing them from seeing each other. Rather, OP is confusing an adoption order that states they are now the family and that the daughter has no *legal* ties to her previous family.  OP, call your lawyer who handled the adoption and get a visit with scheduled with these kids.", "Which is SIX YEARS AWAY for her. Absolutely wild.\n\nYTA", "My money is on making it up because they want to force her to be \"our little girl\" and contact with her birth family breaks that illusion.\n\nThey are clearly having problems integrating her into the family based on their reffering to their adopted daughter as their foster.", "Every time I re-read this post, I get more mad tbh. Foster care is traumatic even with the best of foster parents. To have parents who tell you \u201coh those aren\u2019t your siblings anymore and you can\u2019t see them and if you keep asking you can\u2019t even talk to them\u201d is infuriating. How cruel. Either OP is a huge liar or a huge idiot.", "Yeah I'm calling bullshit because it's against every known study and policy in the last 25 years. Unless the person they were dealing with is extremely old school, what they're advising is long out of practice.", "Apparently the state of denial.\n\nThis is one of the cruelest things I've heard in A WHILE.", "He says they've already adopted her. I hope he's lying and she's still in the system. If not I hope that there are safety nets in place and this poor child is able to tell a case worker what is happening, sadly, I don't think that's the case once an adoption is final.", "We ALL do.\n\nNothing in psychology or current adoption philosophy supports the bullshit this dude is dealing out. \n\nHe just doesn't want her to see them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Tks \ud83c\udf38", "The poor kid probably feels like her brothers are more her family than OP is, since the adoption seems recent.", "I don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t want her to see her brothers\u2026 you specifically said they were in a safe home, so it\u2019s not like letting her visit is going to jeopardize her safety.", "I hope that this whole fucking post is a big lie, because it's one of the cruelest things I've ever read."]}
