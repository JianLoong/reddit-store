Separating siblings is NOT what is best for them. Keeping siblings separated because that's what you want to do is absolutely awful, and it doesn't matter that \"legally they're not siblings anymore\", biologically they will ALWAYS be siblings and believe it or not most siblings want to see each other! You are BEYOND cruel for refusing to allow her to see them. She might live with you for the next 6 years but the day she turns 18 you will for sure be out of her life and you'll deserve it.", "YTA. I think you just expect her to forget about her biological family and conform to your family. She had a life before you and if you deny this, she will never adjust to living in your family. \n\nAlso, I don't believe this is something any social worker or adoption agency would say. I think you just don't want her to have contact with her brothers.", "Yta. You could easily ask for supervised visitation for her and siblings.

If your family and their family agree to keep contact, that\u2019s allowed. She is your child, no longer a ward of the state. She\u2019s been adopted. She can do what you give her permission to do as your child. It sounds less like she can\u2019t and more like you don\u2019t want her to.

Why on EARTH would you think that was an acceptable thing to do to a child, simply because she was removed from her parents and put into the foster system?\n\nYou have a major opportunity here to switch from being TA she never forgives to being a superhero who saves her world.

To break her?", "YTA You have a daughter and I\u2019m sure you want the best for her. You\u2019ve adopted her so legally there is 0 reason she can\u2019t see her siblings. The brothers foster parents are open to them having a relationship. Trust and security is huge for any kid, especially one in foster care and you\u2019re harming that for no reason. If you\u2019re nervous, allow her to see them in a supervised setting. If you\u2019re concerned about her mental health, couple this experience with a therapist. Your daughter is 12, not 4, she can understand a lot and deal with a lot and probably has dealt with a lot. Her relationship with her siblings is invaluable because they have experiences together that only they understand and you can really harbor her well-being and theirs by letting them grow through that.", ">this is better for all of them.\n\nNo, it's not! Congratulations she already hates you. \n\nWhy are they not allowed to see each other? You adopted her so how is it not allowed? Don't start the legally they're not siblings nonsense. \n\nOhhhhh there isn't any restrictions. You're a liar. You said the agency said it might cause problems and I don't believe you.

She's been taken from her family and then taken away from the support system she had that was her brothers. She's not going to forget them or let them go, and if she wants to see them there's no reason not to let her. That's assuming that they didn't hurt or abuse her; the insinuation is that's why they \"can't\" see her but you don't come out and say it, and it turns out that she can, in fact, see them.\n\nI hope she's working with a therapist and has her own advocate to adjust to her new situation because you don't seem to have her best interests at heart here.", "YTA \n\nYou are being unnecessarily cruel. Those boys are her family and they will always be her family. \n\nYou don\u2019t know the other family because you have not made the effort to get to know them.

You could also plan meetups a few times a year in public places.", "I just said that for context, I should've said adopted yes.", "Yeah, that seem really off unless the brothers were doing something to the girl.

I\u2019m not trying to diminish the need for ongoing contact, but a kid bounced around in the system likely doesn\u2019t have a lot of trust in adults.  Telling her they are fine doesn\u2019t work like seeing they are fine.  These kids are going to have questions about being separated anyway - keeping them separate won\u2019t change that.", "I'm glad other people noticed that. My sister is adopted and I know once we got the call that things were finalized, I was so happy to be able to call her my sister. I will sometimes say adopted (our age gap is pretty big) but I certainly never called her My \"foster sister\" once it was finalized. She's your daughter. You can clarify she was adopted, but I don't see why if it's finalized you are still calling her your foster daughter. If you're worried about confusing her, maybe stop referring to her as that and call her your daughter. Seeing her brothers isn't where the confusion will lie.", "It\u2019s especially bizarre given OP\u2019s argument that the girl being adopted means she and her family of origin aren\u2019t related anymore and are forbidden to even communicate.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure where this is, but that\u2019s effed.  Even if they gain new families it makes them no less siblings who I imagine shared not just parents and a home in early life, but some incredibly hard experiences they\u2019ll be dealing with well into adulthood.  They will be lucky to have someone who really understands.\n\nOP, YTA for your perspective if nothing else.\n\nEdit:  OP backtracks the statement about forbidden contact in a comment - at most it was a word of caution regarding the challenges of integration into adoptive families when they weren\u2019t adopted together.
