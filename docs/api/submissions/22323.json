{"id": 22323, "submission_id": "150gct3", "title": "AITA for telling my brother that his \"fianc\u00e9\" is embarrassing?", "selftext": "I (M27) am the second oldest of four kids: Amy (F29), myself, Robert (M26), and Christa (F22). We're a pretty close-knit family; however, I feel that Robert's engagement to this girl, Rebecca (F26), somewhat threatens that.\n\nRobert met Rebecca about five years ago when they were studying at university, and they started their relationship about two years ago. At first, our parents (M65 and F63) were largely okay with things, as we all thought the arrangement was temporary. While they didn't openly disapprove of Rebecca, they constantly reminded Robert that she had too different a background, making it unlikely for them to take the relationship seriously.\n\nFor some context, Rebecca is relatively polite but a little crude and somewhat lacks modesty. According to Robert himself, she has developed a taste for expensive things, and he is often happy to indulge her.\n\nAmy disapproved from the start. She would tell Robert that Rebecca was crude and only after his money, and that he shouldn't entertain anything with Rebecca. Myself and Christa wouldn't say too much about it, but as things got more serious between Robert and Rebecca, I would try to remind Robert that we don't have the same values as Rebecca and that our parents wouldn't approve.\n\nKnowing how our parents value certain things, Robert has kept his relationship more low-key for the past few months. For example, during the Christmas holidays, he claimed to be traveling to Europe with his friends when, in reality, he spent the time with Rebecca and her parents.\n\nNext week, we have a large extended family gathering from my father's side. Earlier this week, Robert told Amy and myself on a group call that he had proposed to Rebecca, and she said yes. Amy was furious with this and told Robert that Rebecca was an unsuitable match for him and that our parents would be livid. Robert said that they would understand eventually, and Amy then told him that he was being childish and would be given a harsh reality check when he breaks the news to our parents.\n\nI was even a little annoyed that he would make such a plan without discussing it with us first but decided not to say anything. After Amy left the call, Robert asked me if it was appropriate to tell our parents. I told him that it wouldn't be. He then asked why, and I told him that he already knew that marrying someone like Rebecca would cause significant embarrassment to our parents, particularly in the presence of our family friends and extended relatives.\n\nHe got upset with me and told me that he was hoping for my support and that I disappointed him. My intention wasn't to hurt his feelings; I only wanted to give him a small glimpse of how our parents will react when they find out.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with Christa this evening. Earlier today, Amy had brought her up to speed, so she's familiar with the situation. Long story short, she overall isn't too interested and thinks the whole situation will \"sort itself out.\" While she thinks Rebecca is a little too clingy, she believes that Robert probably has his reasons for indulging her.\r\n\nShe did mention that Amy asked her to talk to Robert and ask him to reconsider his decision, but Christa declined, as she doesn't believe Robert has done anything wrong yet. However, she said that if Robert does decide to reveal his engagement to our parents during our family gathering, she'll be upset with him, as it would seem that he intentionally wanted to embarrass them.\r\n\nThe last thing she mentioned is that, like Amy and myself, she believes our parents will significantly reduce Robert's financial support if he decides to proceed with the engagement. She thinks this may be a good thing, as it will give us closure on whether Rebecca is only interested in his money or not. If Rebecca does stick around, Christa said she would be pretty disappointed in me and especially in Amy.\r\n\nWe'll all just have to wait and see how things play out. I am worried for Robert, but if he does go ahead with this, then my hands are tied. I plan to talk to Robert later and advise him to be more discreet in how he reveals the information to our parents.\r", "created_utc": 1689438598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150gct3/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_his_fianc\u00e9_is/", "score": 2180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your family and their crowd think anyone who's not like them is lesser than them? So much so they feel embarrassed to let a lesser person into the family. So the key thing here is to develop yourself, question your norms and think for yourself.... despite the natural bias your background and family force on you unknowingly.\n\nAnd that's how things like slavery came about btw, as did almost every war in existence. Not stupid family marriages... but people thinking they were superior because of their skin colour or their views or similar. People thinking they were superior because of differences. But really the only thing they had that was superior, was the money to buy more troops, more weapons, more slave drivers.\n\nYou're not dealing with something that serious, but it's important to think about what hatred and superiority over differences brings about, if it's allowed to spread by people not standing up to it.

Like look really deep inside yourself for a minute and ask yourself why her clothes make you hate her? It's hard to answer right? Places that cover woman up because they think their bodies are offensive, or that men can't control themselves around anyone with some skin showing... are countries where they get raped stoned and killed. What does a bit of midrift or comfy leggings to do you to cause you misfortune or pain? We started as naked cavemen and there's still tribes that walk around with no tops on and breasts out. We decide what the social norms are and why. But nobody will tell you why.. ask your parents and they'll just say \"it's inappropriate\" but why? There's 9 billion naked bodies on the planet but we decided to cover woman up... why?\n\nSwearing is pretty standard across the world, it's just words and only other people get to decide how offensive they are. Evidently to her and your brother, neither her clothes nor words have any offensiveness to them. Why do you find them in passing conversation where they come with no ill intent, so upsetting? Because you've been taught your whole life you must be polite and words matter more than the meaning behind them?\n\nThe key is they are different to what you know.

Because of nothing. They're embarrassed by the person who makes him happy and loves him over clothes and the way she talks.\n\nThe outcome of this, is that you'll lose your brother. Your whole family will. Think about this, deeply think about it and what your reasons are for finding these differences so terrible... and then put down what side you are on and don't sit on the fence.\n\nUnless there's something actually bad about her, malicious intent, hatred, etc etc, then it should be your brother's side.\n\nEvery culture around the world is different, from having loads of skin out, having none, speaking differently, acting more or less polite.

The core difference can be simplified as upper class = old money (that\u2019s where your titles come in) and middle class = new money. A middle class person could in theory have more money than an upper class person, but it won\u2019t have the same prestige as the money that has made its way down through many generations. In a sense, upper class money is more valuable than middle class money."]}
