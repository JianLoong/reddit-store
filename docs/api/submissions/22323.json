Yall sound like some of the most obnoxious and snobby family from a damn movie", "That's not at all reasonable. The fact that you can't live without your parent's permission and constantly seek their approval doesn't mean that it's normal behavior.", "Awww you got mommy and daddy's approval. Cute. Grow up.", "If that\u2019s something you cared about before getting engaged, fine. But you don\u2019t get to project that on or require that from your brother. Who do you people think you are?", "Seems like breeding animals. The owners (parents)choose who you breed with. Yta for the whole snobby family.\n\nEdit: a word", "You're brainwashed, you need help. Your parents sound evil and controlling. Get out while you still can.", "Sounds like your parents have successfully brainwashed you into being extensions of themselves and not letting you have a single coherent thought of your own. Maybe try removing your head from your ass. Your brother loves his fianc\u00e9e he doesn\u2019t need anyones approval.", "You and especially your parents are disgusting.", "you mean also stuck up snobs with sticks up there asses", "and how often do you have sex", "So neither you or your sister are sufficiently mature enough to decide your lives for yourselves? Sounds like you parents failed at parenting.", "How do you know your significant other isn't interested in you for your money? They're not here for the personality, that's for sure...", "Sounds like you married someone to make sure you wouldn\u2019t lose your trust fund. I\u2019d put odds on your marriage ending in divorce while Robert lives happily with Rebecca", "You are so brainwashed lol. Let your brother live his life and be happy he has enough individualism to make choices for himself.", "Are you all from the 1800's?", "Wrong.", "What a terrible family.  You claim to be close knit but won't attend the wedding.  Your parents are ready to cut Robert off.  ESH except Robert and Rebecca.\nINFO. Is it race or poverty that is disgusting all of you?", "Imagine his relief!  Oh to be rid of you, and cease this insufferable dance.", "Close knit as long as you do what the family thinks is best.  Who gives a fuck about your own happiness as long as Amy and parents and the other siblings get their way? Wonderful family there indeed. I can see why your brother chose to not come home for Christmas.", "You are all just absolutely terrible people.", "Your family isn't close-knit; you're just controlling.", "\u201cclose knit family\u201d but willing to cut off your BROTHER for being in love. you and amy are both awful, terrible, and vile people. you posted this yet are not willing to admit you\u2019re the AH. you just keep being defensive and saying dumb shit in replies. you\u2019re so up your ass that you can\u2019t even fathom the idea that you\u2019re wrong, even if hundreds tell you you are.", "And that's what I expect as well. It's quite predictable this ain't gonna sit by with your parents.", "Its not constantly seeking their approval or permission. But, if you have a strong relationship with your parents you should definitely listen to their input and warnings regarding big decisions.", "Think about it like this, if mine or Amy's relationship fails. We still have a strong relationship with our siblings and parents. If Robert's fails, what is he left with?", "Yeah, and if they actually had any intelligence, they would know that \"hybrids\" are the strongest. \"Purebreds\" are more likely to have health or congenital problems.", "Are we counting the required and appropriate bedding ceremony?", "Well, Rebecca is eastern European so....", ">Its not constantly seeking their approval or permission\n\nYou absolutely are.\n\n> But, if you have a strong relationship with your parents you should definitely listen to their input and warnings regarding big decisions.\n\nYou absolutely do not.", "this is some game of thrones stuff right here \n\nthere targaryen it probley only marry brothers siters and uncles to keep the blood line pure", "If you have a strong relationship with your parents, then they won't cut you out of their lives because you choose a partner they don't approve of. They may voice their concerns, but they're there for you none-the-less. If not, then you DON'T have a strong relationship with your parents and,  quite frankly, your parents are shitty parents. Good parents do not cut their children out of their lives because they choose a partner they don't like/approve of.  \n\nIf your brother and his fiance do split in the future, what makes you think he'd actually turn to any of you for support given how little you all value him? This kind of conditional \"love\" is neither healthy nor reliable, and your brother is better off learning to live without all of your \"support.\"\n\nI get not liking someone a family member marries, and even expressing conerns, but to behave the way your family is behaving is disgusting to me.  I say this as someone whose extended family strongly disapproved of my parents' marriage, but after 46+ very happy years, have all come around to admitting how wrong they were. However, even when they believed they were right, they still supported my parents' union because that's what GOOD family does.", "Listen, sure.  Do what you're told (expectations!), no.", "A healthy sense of self because he doesn\u2019t cater to his family whose love is clearly conditional.", "Same kind of relationship he already has with you now, which isn\u2019t strong, it\u2019s conditional if you\u2019re willing to turn your back on him over his choice of a partner.", "If you'd cut ties with your brother because he loves someone you \"don't approve of\", then he's better off without you.", "Your lack of support for Robert is on YOU, not him.", "Based on your judgmental and condescending comments, Robert may be better off without you anyway.", "yes because you are  targaryen it probley only marry brothers siters and uncles to keep the blood line pure\n\nso if you divorce family is still there", "You don't seem to consider the idea that you guys may be no great loss in his life.", "GoT entered the room\ud83e\udd23"]}
