Taught this pretty awful thing all your life until you believe it and don't even know why. And if you'd been raised by other people, your views would be totally different. Your family and their crowd think anyone who's not like them is lesser than them? So much so they feel embarrassed to let a lesser person into the family. So the key thing here is to develop yourself, question your norms and think for yourself.... despite the natural bias your background and family force on you unknowingly.\n\nAnd that's how things like slavery came about btw, as did almost every war in existence. Not stupid family marriages... but people thinking they were superior because of their skin colour or their views or similar. People thinking they were superior because of differences. But really the only thing they had that was superior, was the money to buy more troops, more weapons, more slave drivers.\n\nYou're not dealing with something that serious, but it's important to think about what hatred and superiority over differences brings about, if it's allowed to spread by people not standing up to it. And the people who stopped this were the ones who realised there was no superiority.\n\nA crop top and leggings is pretty normal where I live for anyone. Its just clothes.

Like look really deep inside yourself for a minute and ask yourself why her clothes make you hate her? It's hard to answer right? Places that cover woman up because they think their bodies are offensive, or that men can't control themselves around anyone with some skin showing... are countries where they get raped stoned and killed. What does a bit of midrift or comfy leggings to do you to cause you misfortune or pain? We started as naked cavemen and there's still tribes that walk around with no tops on and breasts out. We decide what the social norms are and why. But nobody will tell you why.. ask your parents and they'll just say \"it's inappropriate\" but why? There's 9 billion naked bodies on the planet but we decided to cover woman up... why?\n\nSwearing is pretty standard across the world, it's just words and only other people get to decide how offensive they are. Evidently to her and your brother, neither her clothes nor words have any offensiveness to them. Why do you find them in passing conversation where they come with no ill intent, so upsetting? Because you've been taught your whole life you must be polite and words matter more than the meaning behind them?\n\nThe key is they are different to what you know.

If this is a lifelong partner, she'll be more support and companionship for him across his life than other family ever really will be. It's just a different type of connection. Your partner comes first. He's happy. But she's different from you... so your family hate her and will try to make him be miserable and give up someone he sees a future with purely because of that. Because of nothing. They're embarrassed by the person who makes him happy and loves him over clothes and the way she talks.\n\nThe outcome of this, is that you'll lose your brother. Your whole family will. Think about this, deeply think about it and what your reasons are for finding these differences so terrible... and then put down what side you are on and don't sit on the fence.\n\nUnless there's something actually bad about her, malicious intent, hatred, etc etc, then it should be your brother's side.\n\nEvery culture around the world is different, from having loads of skin out, having none, speaking differently, acting more or less polite.
