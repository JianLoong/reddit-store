Jess does a lot of artsy crafty type stuff as a hobby. Drawing, painting, water colours, etc. She has a huge collection of art supplies, I know that some of her stuff is really expensive and high quality.\n\nWhile Jess went on a girls trip with her friends, I had some family members over for a movie night at the flat.\n\nI realised some of Jess's art supplies were sitting in the living room so I went to go put them away.\n\nMy niece Abby (f9) saw the art supplies and got all excited and asked if she could draw. I told her that they belong to Jess and she's not here to give permission, plus some of her art supplies are expensive. So no. Abby just accepted it and didn't argue.\n\nMy sister Eva (f30s) got a bit annoyed and made some passive-aggressive comments implying that I'm being touchy and overprotective of the stuff around the home. She made comments like \"Jess isn't here to give permission I guess we can't sit on the couch\". I ignored it.\n\nThe next day, Jess shows me some messages she got off Eva. Eva told her what happened with Abby at the flat, and said that I was being ridiculous. She basically told Jess that she needs to get over herself and that she needs to \"support budding artists\".\n\nJess told her she was being unreasonable and that I was just respecting her belongings, and explained that some of her art supplies are indeed very expensive. Eva really didn't like that, and said that she should teach Abby how to use the expensive supplies and that it's her \"duty\" to mentor younger artists. \n\nEva kept pressuring Jess into teaching Abby art stuff even though Jess didn't want to.\n\nI got really angry just reading the messages. I called Eva and told her to stop messaging Jess about it and leave her alone. Eva protested and told me that she's just looking out for her daughter and \"the future of art\". I told Eva to piss off and stop pestering my girlfriend.\n\nEva started crying then hung up the phone. She blocked me on everything shortly afterwards and later that day I get very angry messages off of my parents, telling me I'm \"bullying\" Eva and that I need to apologise for being so mean.", "created_utc": 1671248725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znxb1o/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_stop_messaging_my/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my sister to stop messaging my gf asking for free art lessons for her daughter, and I told her to piss off\n2. My sister was only asking, and my gf could've blocked her, and this followed a situation where my niece wanted to use my gf's art supplies and I told her no. My sister just wants the best for her daughter. Also I was probably being unnecessarily mean by telling her to piss off.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It never ceases to amaze me how some folks can dish it out but they can\u2019t take it! Sounds like your sister wants what she wants and expects others to accommodate that. She tried to bully your girlfriend and, when you wouldn\u2019t put up with it, finally telling her to back off, here come the water works. She kept \u201cpestering\u201d your girlfriend so apparently she wouldn\u2019t accept a polite NO for an answer so you had to deliver a more forceful response. If she had respected your girlfriend\u2019s answer, she needn\u2019t have been told to \u201cpiss off.\u201d  Sounds like she can be a drama queen. NTA.", "NTA. Your parents need to understand what bullying behavior is. Eva. Eva is bullying behavior.", "NTA. Tightass sister can by art supplies for her own kid.", "NTA. Eva needs to grow up and learn to respect other people.", "NTA, but I get the feeling Eva has misrepresented the situation to make her look like the injured party, such as being selective with the context. Explain the full picture to your parents and if they still think Eva is the wronged on, that's on them.\n\nThe irony is that if Eva hadn't harassed Jess, Jess might have been more open to doing some art stuff with Abby.", "NTA, your parents are getting onto the wrong sibling.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not Jess' responsibility to \"support budding artists\". If Eva's daughter wants to be an artist, then Eva should sign her up for art classes and buy her her own supplies. As an artsy person myself, some of my supplies are insanely expensive, and I would absolutely not be okay with kids using them. I'm happy to help my nieces/nephews do crafts, but with supplies that are bought by their parents/ cheap ones I supply,  and aren't expensive materials that will cost me a lot to replace.", "NTA. Your sister really does need to leave your gf tf alone", "NTA.. Eva is the AH!!\n\nEva needs to learn respect for others things.. jess is under no obligation to mentor anyone .. eva is the one who needs to get over herself\n\nIf eva really wants her daughter to learn art or what not she can pay for lessons \u2026 and pay for the art supplies needed.", "NTA. You set the boundaries in you mr him and helped your girlfriend set boundaries with your sister, she reacted with entitlement, so you had to be more direct, there is nothing wrong with that.\nFor you parents, your sister may have exaggerated the truth, you could try to give your version to your parents, see if that appease them.", "What?\n\nNTA!\n\nWho texts someone\u2019s girlfriend and abused them for being selfish with their possessions WHEN THEY WERE NOT EVEN THERE!\n\nThen demands that she take time out of her day, use her expensive equipment and teach her kid!\n\nWhat planet is your sister on that the world revolves around her kid?!?!\n\nSounds like Abby took it fine! Ya know. Like a normal human who hears no on occasion and understands then moves on!", "NTA. Your sister cried wold to your parents before you could. At least your niece is more mature than her so that\u2019s a bonus. You did the right thing by saying no about your gf\u2019s supplies being used AND for standing up for her when it came to your family.", "NTA", "NTA.

Your sister really needs help", "NTA. Pushy people suck. And people who raise people to be pushy suck, too.", "I don\u2019t know where you live but most communities have cheap art classes specifically designed for kids. Your niece would have more fun taking a class with a friend. Suggest this to Eva or give the information directly to Abby. Let Abby pester her mom about enrolling in a class.", "NTA this is a power play my man, it's that she's not getting her way. That snide comment about the couch is what seals it, I've no idea the dynamics behind your relationship but she has chosen this as a point to set her heels in. Be stern but not over emotional on decisions and relaying them, the emotionality is what she will play on. If you act neutral and aloof and stick to your boundaries as you have, her arguments will crumble. Oh and record all conversations lol it never hurts to have a person's words available when the stories start to change behind the scenes. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "NTA Eva is the bully! And very entitled.", "NTA.  Bullying EVA?  That sounds more like what Eva's doing to Jess.  Your sister is an entitled bitch.  Your family members need to know what is really going on, and if they l know, they need a reality check as to who is being mean here.\n\nEvery time I go to this site I am amazed at people's sense of entitlement.  It's like they just make up their own rules for life, and everyone else should just go along with it.", "NTA. Another entitled adult running to parents cause they didn\u2019t win their unreasonable demands.  You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.  Tell your parents they need to hear both sides before they jump to defend the indefensible actions of your sister.  You can always block all of them if they don\u2019t drop it.  Their call", "NTA.

It's downright heart warming to see posts like this, OP, you sound like a genuinely caring BF. Second, because idk what kind of art supplies she has but if it's anything like mine...well expensive can mean a range of things. It can mean $300 and up... and up. Sets of certain pencils can comminly come to $600-1000. She could have done what I did and individually purchased certain things. Some of my art pencils and pastels are almost $6 each. Literally $6 a pencil or piece of chalk. My one gift to myself a year is art supplies because I'm a magpie and I need all the shiny, shiny colors.
