I had never been there before but was excited to go. When we (wife of 15 years, me, and our 4 year old son) arrived, the house was extremely unclean. The air conditioning was not running - on a 95* Georgia summer day. There were three dogs and a cat in cages relentlessly barking. Dog shit was all over the place inside and out. The house smelled foul. I couldn\u2019t stand to be in the house. I hung out with my brother in law outside most of the time. Dinner was served but I couldn\u2019t eat. My son was oblivious, playing with the other kids, but I couldn\u2019t stop watching him, afraid he would get into something gross. \n\nAfter an hour, I texted my wife \u201ccan we please go? I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d She said no. We argued over text for a bit and told me to go home if I wanted to and she would catch a ride later. Of course I didn\u2019t do that. I sucked it up and stayed the entire time. When we left she said I was being disrespectful to her family for wanting to go home. She said she would never act that way at my family\u2019s parties. She said essentially that I was being a snob and that this is just how it is at people of lower incomes houses. \n\nContext: my wife is an immigrant and person of color who was raised in poverty. I\u2019m a middle class white guy, so there\u2019s that. \n\nWe have plenty of friends and family at lower income levels who we visit frequently. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t matter to me. Even the heat at the party, which was uncomfortable, was not that big of a deal. It was the unhygienic, (IMO dangerous) conditions of the house that made me want to leave. I just thought it was gross and didn\u2019t want to be there, or my son to be there. I don\u2019t care about the socioeconomic status of my friends or family, but I do expect a basic level of hygiene when I\u2019m invited for a visit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take any extra money to clean your house or keep after a pet.

When I grew up, the money for water was not always there and the time wasn't either.\n\nHowever, that meant ... no adding things to the household, such as animals, that needed time and water. If you know you are short the water or the time to stay clean, you don't make it worse. This does sound unhealthy and dangerous.", "Raised by the descendants of dirt poor alcoholic irish imigrants whose #1 thing was keeping a clean house makes me particularly annoyed with the implication poor=dirty.

My almost 80-year-old MIL will still sweep and mop the floors everyday, and they don't even have pets anymore.\n\nI've heard an unrelated dude coming from a poor family say that whenever he feels down, he will clean something up using some bleach.

Poverty doesn\u2019t mean you have no dignity. \n\nMental health issues can cause people\nto neglect their surroundings and themselves in this way, but it\u2019s definitely not the state all poor people live in.

She might not get a say in how many animals live in the house or much support in keeping the house presentable. She and/or bf might have mental health issues that impact their ability to keep house.
