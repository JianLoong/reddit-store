(They split up when I was very young cause of unknown problems.)\nAlmost Every year I spent Christmas, Easter, my birthday and other Holidays even Father\u2019s Day at my mom\u2019s. As you may see my mother has primary custody and I see my dad every second week. (To me my dad is my everything and just a massive comfort). Now I can describe my relationship with my mother only as toxic. One day she\u2019s the sweetest woman ever and the other I get blamed for all her problems. She yells at me, hits me and then hours later she apologises.\nThe problem she has with this situation is that I\u2019m \u201cdrifting away from her\u201d. This year I spent my birthday with my dad, because my mom worked ,cause of her job, but hasn\u2019t even first acknowledged that my birthday was that time. I mean I understand she has a new job so I was just a bit hurt, but happy for her I guess. The last weekend I got the offer to spent Silvester at his house with his wife of three years (51f). Today I asked her casually, if I could spent that holiday at his house and she tried to bribe me into staying saying they probably are busy. Then I straight up said I got an invitation and she instantly became more distant. Because I already will spend two days after Christmas at his. She then asked me, if I wanted her to be all alone at the holidays (a week), because she has off at that week and wants me to be there, which I didn\u2019t even know. There was always drama, if I wanted to go to my dad at holidays, but now she\u2019s really cold towards me saying I will distance myself more and more from her in the future, cause I apparently only care about my dad. Which isn\u2019t true in the slightest, because I was there in her depressive stage in life in my early teen years and she didn\u2019t really care when I told her I didn\u2019t wanna be here anymore. I don\u2019t know I feel bad because she\u2019s in the next room ugly sobbing and she just pushed me away when I tried making a compromise.\n\nSorry if I left anything out, it\u2019s just really overwhelming right now.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: Okay y\u2019all I didn\u2019t realise not everybody knows Silvester.

I don't know what Silvester is but if you live in the US, UK, etc. then you can report her for child abuse and get 100% custody with your father. She did, and you can. Get out of there. At 17, no judge is going to make you stay with your mother if you want to live with your father. Ask him to push for full custody and talk to a school counselor or teacher about your mom's behavior. They are required, legally, to report any suspected child abuse. Hitting you counts. Sorry you've had to deal with this, it's not right, and I hope you can go to your father's and be safe soon.", "NTA. You're 17 and you can choose who you want to spend more time with. You could even move in with him if you really wanted to. Your mother is absolutely in the wrong for trying to manipulate you and the more she tries to hold tightly with emotional blackmail, the more likely she is to drive you away.
