Back when I got together with my fiance, he was a massive clean freak. He had severe untreated OCD and absolutely everything that he came in contact with had to be cleaned in a way he saw fit. This also came down to body hair.. so basically we were taking a shower together one day and I was leaned down and shaving my legs when I felt him from behind me take his razor and like.. shave my upper crack area. I wasn't even hairy. I had peach fuzz but apparently it grossed him out and he felt the need to shave me without warning or permission. I was pissed because I don't shave there for obvious reasons (I didn't want thicker fucking hair growing) but also from a medical standpoint. That area is where cysts form due to ingrown hairs. He had that issue and needed surgery so you would think he would have been smarter. It caused a massive fight. \n\nAnyways, I ended up getting a severally infected cyst on my tailbone maybe 2 months later. I went and had it drained and packed. I then got another one last week and I lost my shit completely. I am in so much pain and I know for a fact it's because he insisted on shaving me in that area and me now having ingrown hairs there because of it. I have a big ass. There's no avoiding it. I am in an extreme amount of pain and can hardly walk. I'm snappy because i haven't been sleeping either because I move in my sleep and due to this fucking cyst, I keep waking up in pain whenever I move. I told him he is paying for the entire cyst removal since he is the reason I even have this problem. The surgery is $6500, give or take and I don't have the money for it and my insurance hardly covers $250. He got pissed because he is saving for a boat, among other stuff and I told him I don't care. He caused the problem without my permission and now he will be the one to pay out of pocket to fix the issue. He won't talk to me at all but did write out the check.

I figured it out after a second but there was a small flash of confusion.", "Jesus, this dude is a dozen different kinds of irrational. Doesn\u2019t everyone know you never buy a boat- you rent? Unless you hate having money or free time.", "She got a cyst shortly after. The type of cyst she got is known to have a high chance of reoccurring which it did.", "The original text is saved by the automod:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o88wn/aita_for_making_him_pay_for_my_surgery_out_of_his/j6d0sbz/\n\nThe poster you are replying to has misquoted OP.", "That\u2019s what I keep coming back to. Um, yuck!", "IF (big IF) bf did ERP, progress could be that rapid. ERP for OCD can have very rapid results if the client is motivated.", "It could be like Cuban yogurt...", "Only half?", "I guess this might only apply to dental care then. I know of someone with dental insurance that didn\u2019t have insurance the year prior to a wisdom teeth removal surgery. If they wanted to wait for the surgery to be covered they had to have dental insurance for a year. This was after Obamacare.\n\nYou can\u2019t be denied insurance coverage (being able to buy a policy) based on a preexisting condition. That doesn\u2019t mean that they have to cover your surgery. Policy\u2019s can vary. The insurance company can declare that the surgery isn\u2019t necessary, regardless of what your doctor says (which is crap). \n\nI guess it may make a difference going from one plan to another vs no insurance to insurance. Be careful when switching regardless because you might find yourself with an insurance plan that does their best to deny everything.", "Just out of curiosity-- going back to the original commenter's question, how would you be able to tell what caused the cyst? Is it possible to tell with 100% certainty at all? It seems to me like there could be a few possibilities, but unless you were the bacteria that caused the infection, how could you be sure?"]}
