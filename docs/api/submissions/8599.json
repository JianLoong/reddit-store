I wasn't even hairy. I had peach fuzz but apparently it grossed him out and he felt the need to shave me without warning or permission. I was pissed because I don't shave there for obvious reasons (I didn't want thicker fucking hair growing) but also from a medical standpoint. That area is where cysts form due to ingrown hairs. He had that issue and needed surgery so you would think he would have been smarter. It caused a massive fight. \n\nAnyways, I ended up getting a severally infected cyst on my tailbone maybe 2 months later. I went and had it drained and packed. I then got another one last week and I lost my shit completely. I am in so much pain and I know for a fact it's because he insisted on shaving me in that area and me now having ingrown hairs there because of it. I have a big ass. There's no avoiding it. I am in an extreme amount of pain and can hardly walk. I'm snappy because i haven't been sleeping either because I move in my sleep and due to this fucking cyst, I keep waking up in pain whenever I move.

The surgery is $6500, give or take and I don't have the money for it and my insurance hardly covers $250. He got pissed because he is saving for a boat, among other stuff and I told him I don't care. He caused the problem without my permission and now he will be the one to pay out of pocket to fix the issue. He won't talk to me at all but did write out the check.

When you shave, you take off the tapered end. When it continues to grow, the blunted tip is further down the hair shaft than the original tapered point, where the hair shaft is thicker.\n\nThe hair hasn't BECOME thicker, but yes. Individual hairs 100% appear thicker after shaving, until they fall out and are replaced by a new hair strand that will once again have a tapered tip."]}
