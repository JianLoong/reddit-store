Back when I got together with my fiance, he was a massive clean freak. He had severe untreated OCD and absolutely everything that he came in contact with had to be cleaned in a way he saw fit. This also came down to body hair.. so basically we were taking a shower together one day and I was leaned down and shaving my legs when I felt him from behind me take his razor and like.. shave my upper crack area. I wasn't even hairy. I had peach fuzz but apparently it grossed him out and he felt the need to shave me without warning or permission. I was pissed because I don't shave there for obvious reasons (I didn't want thicker fucking hair growing) but also from a medical standpoint. That area is where cysts form due to ingrown hairs. He had that issue and needed surgery so you would think he would have been smarter. It caused a massive fight. \n\nAnyways, I ended up getting a severally infected cyst on my tailbone maybe 2 months later. I went and had it drained and packed. I then got another one last week and I lost my shit completely. I am in so much pain and I know for a fact it's because he insisted on shaving me in that area and me now having ingrown hairs there because of it. I have a big ass. There's no avoiding it. I am in an extreme amount of pain and can hardly walk. I'm snappy because i haven't been sleeping either because I move in my sleep and due to this fucking cyst, I keep waking up in pain whenever I move. I told him he is paying for the entire cyst removal since he is the reason I even have this problem. The surgery is $6500, give or take and I don't have the money for it and my insurance hardly covers $250. He got pissed because he is saving for a boat, among other stuff and I told him I don't care. He caused the problem without my permission and now he will be the one to pay out of pocket to fix the issue. He won't talk to me at all but did write out the check. He called me a mooch at one point under his breath, though he denies it.

Reread your own words. You can\u2019t honestly think it\u2019s safe or healthy to stay with someone who\u2019s OCD is so unmanaged that they **SHAVE YOU**. If you stay then E S H. That was such a disgusting violation of your body and you deserve better.

Also this is break up worthy, \n\n\n1. NEVER SHARE RAZORS, any man and definitely some with a cleaning issue should know this.\n\n2. He's showing you he doesn't care about how he violated you, or the like. \n\n3. He's unwilling to fix the problem he started because to him the boat is more important.", "Well this is a red flag. I understand liking what you like but this goes beyond that. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Is a boat more important than you? Reconsider your relationship. What is the next thing he will feel the need to do without your permission?\n\nI sympathize with those who suffer from OCD but one has to draw a line when someone else's problems become yours. Especially when there is a chance it will affect your health.\n\nEdit: also HE CAUSED THE PROBLEM. Even if it was a compulsion that made him act he needs to own up to his actions and take responsibility.", "NTA. I would leave honestly, because he obviously can\u2019t control himself. This could turn even more ugly for you, time to bail oit", "NTA, I can't believe he thinks saving for a boat (??) is more important than taking care of a medical problem he caused!", "NTA. \n\nHe did something without your permission that caused you harm. Plus, I don't know your financial situation or why you can't afford it, but if you guys are going to get married, wouldn't the  \\[saved\\] money be for both of you for times when you need something? Regardless, it's really sad if he thinks that a boat is more important than helping you get better.", "NTA. Sayin as a person with OCD, you never do those things without permission. I Am sorry he did this\u2026really really sorry", "NTA.\n\nAre you sure this is someone you want to marry, though? Putting a boat above your medical needs is\u2026not a great sign for the future.", "NTA wow. sue him for assault", "NTA get the money and run.", "NTA.\n\nI've had a pilonidal cyst before, I'm pretty sure it runs on one side of my family. Not fun.", "Holy shit. NTA. I am so sorry this happened to you. What he did was assault. OCD is not an excuse. Get your surgery paid for and then get out of this relationship.", "NTA but you need to leave him. You needed to be out the door the second he did that.", "NTA. I\u2019d re think marrying him.", "NTA he basically assaulted you. He needs to take responsibility for the repercussions of his actions. After he pays find a new bf.", "Absolutely NTA.  That was assault and you have complications from it.\n\nIf he doesn't pay, I'd recommend breaking up and taking him to court over it.", "NTA but ffs don't let this relationship continue. He literally assaulted you with a razor and as a result you needed surgery with no remorse.", "Info: was the cyst 100% caused by what he did?", "NTA.

That makes no sense.", "NTA.\n\nGet that surgery done with his money, then break up. \n\nHe shaved you without your permission. \n\nGood thing you haven't left yet, because then he'd refuse to pay, but you absolutely should leave after the surgery is done.", "NTA. But hair does not grow back thicker, that is a myth that still keeos going. It looks a bit tjicker when it grows back first because the razor cuts of the tiomps which are a bit slimmer than the rest. So without the tip you have the stem. It grows out and is completely normal.\nBut yes, shaving can be reason for more ingrown hairs if done badly.", "I'm not sure how to vote on this one because while obviously he shouldn't be shaving you by surprise, I suspect that what he did isn't causing your cysts and the timing is a coincidence.  But I'm not a doctor, so that's just a guess.  Speaking of doctors, has your doctor checked for MRSA?  When I had a similar problem, it kept coming back until I was put on special antibiotics.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(yes what he did could be classified as assault because a razor is technically a weapon since it's a blade and it was used against another person without permission and it did harm to said person) the fact he only has to pay for the surgery is getting off light.\n\nOP has no reason to \"work together\" with the person who assaulted them and honestly should rethink the entire relationship because of this. No one should be using anything on another person without consent.\n\nAnd again he could have easily slipped or fucked up and sliced or nicked in a worse spot and caused worse infections (I've nicked myself down below and it hurt like hell for about a week as it healed. I'm biologically a woman. So really tender space I nicked. And that was with my OWN razor. Not something that was on another person getting their dead skin, bacteria and other crap on the razor. )\n\nHe fucked up.
