You did the right thing taking care of your wife and kids.", "Protect your wife from your Mother. She is sick and gets barged on? Who does that?

But did she have to pay because you didn\u2019t show up?? What even is this? Illness happens.", "Nta but woah your momma is a boundary stomper. Put an end to that. She does not need to verify that your wife is sick.  She should be happy that her son is the kind of husband that steps up when his wife is I'll and not make his sick wife carry on / act like she isn't sick.", "NTA. In fact, it's awesome that you dropped everything to take care of your family. Wife and kiddos come first. \n\nI'm sorry that your mother acted that way. She owes you an apology.

Her coming in to check to see if you were lying or not is over the top. \n\nI hope your wife gets better soon and your Mom figured out her priorities.", "NTA but your mother is something else. Damn, I would be pissed if my husband let his mother in to check to see if I am sick.

If you can't go you can't go and it's gross that she literally went to your bedroom to inspect your wife just to see if you were lying.

Your Mother overstepped by doing that. You should lay down some ground rules moving forward.  What you did was absolutely the right decision, it's what a responsible husband and father does. Your Mother will no doubt want to push back, this is when you politely say this is not up for debate and end the conversation. She may wish to go to family members and/or friends to gather a consensus of people to agree just how right she was. Don't engage in that kind of circus.

You should've told her to go f herself.", "NTA!  Your mother was WAY out of line!  Your wife was sick and you had two kids to take care of in addition to your wife.  You prioritized their well-being over going to a restaurant to celebrate your sister's birthday.  I think you stepped up to the plate and I'm sure your wife really appreciated that!  Mom and sister will get over it!  \n\nYour mother needs to realize that going to the restaurant while a family member was ill would break all rules of common courtesy and respect for other diners, as well!  Sick people should stay home until they feel well again, to help prevent spreading germs.  Shame on mom for not looking at it from anyone else's viewpoint but her own!", "Wow! I think I WOULD tell her to go F herself if she can't understand your priorities here. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou got husbanding right. You got parenting right. \n\nYou are a Rockstar!", "You let your mother get far enough into your home that she made it to the bedroom and bothered your poor wife!?!?\n\nYou and your mom owe your wife a hug apology. \n\nNTA for canceling, but you will be if you don\u2019t set some serious boundaries with your mom.", "NTA, sounds like your mother has an issue with your wife. Does your mother resent your wife for being a stay-at-home mother?", "Your mum needs to chill.

What's the history here with your wife or with you on family catch-ups or anything else? Sounds like we are missing some background.

In what universe is it okay for your mom to invade your home because she wants you to go a dinner for your sister?

At the very least she should have be invited and you got a babysitter for the kids.", " NTA.", "Well time to cut the cord with mommy. That behavior is so unacceptable.

You need to tear mother off a strip and set boundaries.\nMum or Marriage?", "NTA for canceling but you\u2019re a huge AH for letting your mother come inside your house and disrespect you and your sick wife like you\u2019re a 10 year old lying about not having homework.
