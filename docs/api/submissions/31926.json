Friend group left most likely because you were asking her to leave and they would feel awkward staying after she got asked to leave.  You\u2019re not shallow for accepting a gift that is over the price she is willing to splurge on herself.  Had her parents paid as yours did she would have gladly gone and did the course.  Since her parents didn\u2019t pay and yours did she is calling you unfair names.  That\u2019s just not how it works.", "NTA. Why does she care if she's not willing to spend that much money on the nails course. She's making no sense, unless she's saying she would go if she was gifted the course, making her even shallower because she wants it without spending anything herself. What a hypocrite, who can't be happy for anyone else.", "NTA. You literally got it as a birthday gift you don't control what you get from other people. And you're right, she has the money and just hasn't spent it and like I get it I'm always worried I might need that money later but if it's something I want as bad as your friend implies she wants that course, I'll make the money back later.", "NTA, and it sounds like your other friends aren't true friends. However, your guy best friend 100% is.", "Based on OPs responses, OP works and buys a lot of stuff on her own (basically spends her own money as fast as she gets it, which it'sher money and her choice), but for OP's birthday, OP's dad bought her the course. OP's friend also works but prefers to save. The friend also wanted the course but friend's parents don't want to pay for it and friend doesn't want to buy it either. \n\nTo me, it sounds like one of two things (if not both):\n1. The friend is jealous that OP not only freely spends the money she earns but that OP also has parents that will gift her this course instead of making her pay for it. \n2. This friend is the type of person that thinks if she's going without, her friends should support her by also going without. (I personally don't agree with that mindset. Friend's should be happy for your highs in life.)\n\nSome people are asking who wanted the course first, but I don't think that matters really. Friend's often times share interests so they likely enjoy the same things. And the reality is, in the real world, if you tell someone about something and then they go out and buy it because now they want it, well tough. It's not like OP went out and got the very last of something to be spiteful. And the friend already made the choice not to get it because she wants to save her money. \n\nBased on the story, NTA", "NTA. But you should talk to your friends.", "NTA - and you used the saying \"paying a small fortune\" correct, great job!\n\nYou have no control over the gift your dad decided to give you\n\nYou also have no control over your friends parents not giving her the same gift\n\nAnd you have no control over what she spends her money on. \n\nNone of this was your fault. \n\nAnd your friend tried to make your birthday about herself. That was incredibly rude of her. I'm sorry but if your other friends left with her and didn't defend you, they might not be very good friends. Do you really want people like that in your life? It might be time to try to find some better friends.", "INFO:\n\nWho was the first to get interested in this course?\n\nIs there a significant difference in family wealth? and personal income? \n\nAt first sight it seems like unexamined privilege. The way you talk about money \"just lying in the bank account\" makes it look like you don't value how much did it cost to her earn that.", "NTA but here\u2019s the thing. My first job was doing nails back when you didn\u2019t have to have a license in my country.  I didn\u2019t make any money at that job because it was purely commission.  However, it taught me what I needed to know.  I practiced and got really good at it on my own doing my own nails.  Later I started doing other girls nails.  I even ended up, going to nail school later on to make it somewhat official.  In nail school I found that I really had already learned the more important things to do well at nails from practice and that job.  The money I earned, ended up paying for me to go back to school for a second career as a nurse. It has also saved me thousands of dollars doing my nails and my mom\u2019s nails.  \n\nYour friend is jealous because you\u2019re getting to do some thing that she wants to do, but is hesitant to put that much money into.  Sometimes it\u2019s good to just ignore an initial outburst and try to figure out where the person is coming from.  We don\u2019t always act the best in the moment.  If she\u2019s a good friend this is fixable and absolutely forgivable.  \n\nTalk to your friend and offer to teach her everything you\u2019re learning at nail school. If she is serious she should jump at the chance to learn.  You will also want to practice on as many people as possible. It\u2019s the combination of learning the proper techniques and then hours and hours of practice that gets you where you need to be.  Do as many people\u2019s nails as you can. I also cannot stress the importance of proper nail preparation. That is where most beginners run into problems with lifting.  \n\nHave fun and do what you can to help your friend feel better.  Sometimes it\u2019s okay to apologize even when your reaction was justified in order to save a good friendship. She might end up apologizing too.", "[removed]", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but she was never truly your friend. She\u2019s jealous of you. She said you\u2019re not better than her just because your dad pays for everything. You never said that. That had absolutely NOTHING to do with the conversation. She let it slip how  she really feels about you. And to be honest, everyone who left with her and stopped talking to you are also not your friends. The only logical explanation as to why they would take her side is because they feel the same way. You don\u2019t need them. Keep your guy best friend by your side and make new friends during your course. I hope this all works out for you.", "NTA - besides that one friend, your other friends are shady", "NTA. Hopefully, you can make some new, better friends at nail school.", "NTA. I'm going to use my past experience as an analogy. I wanted a horse from the age of 2. Since I (or my parents) couldn't afford one, I was satisfied any time I could work off a ride on people I knew had them. At age 11, a co-worker of my dad's was moving, and his wife had an untrained 2 year old horse they had to part with as their new place only had room for 3 horses. They knew how badly I'd wanted one and offered it to me free. I would have to find a place to board it and pay for all its food, farrier, and vet care myself, but to me, it was worth it. I found a place a half mile away and started doing every job that came my way to pay everything. One friend was gloriously happy for me and actually helped with afternoon feeding and cleaning stall and pasture. Another was very unhappy. Not only because I got something she wanted, but also it took most of my time working to pay those expenses and care for my horse, leaving less time for her. She was very mean and said some horrible things about abandoning friendships and \"putting on airs\" for having a horse when she didn't. I'd ven worked out an arrangement to allow my good friends to ride horses from a neighboring property so we could all go out riding together, in exchange for me (or us) doing afternoon  feeding and clean-up for those horses. But, she turned it down because she didn't want to work to ride someone elses horse. She could have chosen to do it, just like I chose to do the work for mine, but she wouldn't. So, don't feel like you're in the wrong for saying what you said. She made the choice not to join you.  Enjoy your gift, work hard while you learn, and you can make money with the training, as well as save money by doing it yourself.", "So you're \"shallow\" because your dad got you a gift of a thing you wanted to do, but she's not \"shallow\" despite asking for the same exact gift from her parents but not recieving it?

You're not shallow for getting gifted this course your so called \"friend\" is just jealous and cheap just like you said", "Your friends are AHs. Find better ones. Your friends is a selfish AH NTA", "NTA, and she's not a real friend. Most people are \"supportive\" or \"there for you\" until they see you trying to better yourself or in their eyes you have more than them. Then they turn to slander or put downs to try to shame you into doubting yourself so you can stay right down where they are. \n\nLeave this friend and any of the others behind that support her behavior and keep driving forward in life. She has cash she can pay for herself.\n\nWho needs enemies with friends like this?", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault that she\u2019s coveting your gift. You didn\u2019t say anything wrong. It\u2019s ok if she\u2019s disappointed that she doesn\u2019t go but attacking you is not ok. If she was smarter, she could ask you if you\u2019d let her look over the course materials so she could try to teach herself or maybe ask if you\u2019d do her nails.", "NTA. Jealousy can be hard for people to deal with, but that doesn't make it your problem or your fault. Sometimes the people we think are our friends are actually only friends out of convenience, or are only your friend as long as you mirror them. These people are toxic. Don't let people like that stop you from living your dreams and chasing success for your life. It's your future- make sure you're happy with it.", "I fully agree! This is an opportunity for Op to learn about real friends vs \"friends\". \n\nReal friends want to see you succeed and have good things happen for you. \"Friends\" are always worried about how things impact them. \n\nAs an adult, I learned pretty quickly who my real friends were when I announced I was moving across the city for a better house. Or a similar positive move for my life. \n\nReal friends are happy for you and encourage you. They assure you that you can still hang out and that they're excited to try out new restaurants on your side of town. They might say that they are a little envious, but so happy for you. \n\n\"Friends\" start guilt tripping you about moving far away and being jealous about your better place. They discourage you and tell you they aren't willing to drive to that part of town. They might criticise your house, the neighborhood, and so on. \n\nWith time, you learn to invest your time in the people who actually treat you like a person they care about. \n\nIf my best friend wanted to move across the globe tomorrow, I would miss him, but I'd be so happy for him, not sad for myself.
