Still went on to scale the heights of literature, and didn\u2019t turn out a serial killer.", "Much of Polish folklore was based on scary tales, though? (My grandmother could make reading the Bible scarier than Dracula.) And my point is that unless your child is frightened and doesn't want these kinds of stories read to her, ultimately she will evolve and read more complex and alternative literature. \n\nMy husband is a psychiatrist and he would inhibit reading material if the child is upset by the genre.\n\nSo, NTA. Plus a 10-year-old is ready to start reading to herself before she goes to sleep.", "NTA.  You are creating amazing memories with her that she will cherish forever.  You are helping her develop her personality and learn what she loves.  Like your wife, I am a therapist for children and teens.  Unlike your wife, I believe what you are doing is helping her development and her depriving your daughter of time with you and stories she loves will be detrimental to her development and create resentment towards your wife.", "Degenerate art is a Nazi coined term.  No art is degenerate.  Art just reflects people.

Especially when Basia is giving you changing signals, going from \"I trust your judgment to choose appropriate stories\" to \"you're not allowed to read to her anymore because I don't trust your judgment.\"   \n\n\n>She said I\u2019m putting degenerate stuff in Julka\u2019s brain, traumatising and  \n overstimulating her, and destroying the development of her personality.\n\nAs a child psychologist, Basia should have a better grasp on why horror themes are *developmentally appropriate* for Julkas age. \n\nAround middle school age (which would be 11-14 in the US), children are commonly fascinated by gore and horror. This is normal. At this age, they are becoming more aware of the things going on in the world. They hear and read about violence, crimes, war, and so on. They are learning that the world can be a very scary place. \n\nExploring these themes in horror stories, *especially when these are guided by and discussed with a parent*, gives them a chance to explore their emotions in a safe setting. It allows them to explore themes, such as good guys vs. bad guys, and develop a better understanding of concepts like justice and morality. \n\nAdditionally, since the child has the option of putting away the book or asking the parent to stop reading, it allows them to control how much they are exposed to and to say \"I don't like this\" when it becomes overwhelming.\n\nYou have found something that has raised Julka's interest and that is appropriate for her age. As long as you are selective in the stories you're picking, horror content is appropriate. You *do* want to avoid large amounts of gore and focus on stories that  have a \"good\" ending (rather than one that is ambivalent or where the hero dies).\n\nDefinitely NTA here.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou actually asked your wife if she was ok with you reading to your kid the other stories and she didn't object and i think her deciding you are not allowed to read to your kid anymore is not ok.\n\n\nYour kid, like any other kid, is probably excite to read something that was not allowed until recently and I think putting it back in the \"forbidden\" list will just make her interest in it grown even more.", "NTA. Basia makes a lot of sweeping judgements, so it worries me that she's a child psychologist", "NTA. It's generally considered good for a child to find something that resonates with them. Has your wife offered any evidence for her assertion?", "NTA. If you were reading her those stories for your own enjoyment despite her terror, that would be another story. But she clearly enjoys it. She\u2019s 10, she could probably check out a horror book from the library with no one knowing. She\u2019s allowed to enjoy what she enjoys if it\u2019s not genuinely inappropriate or something that would affect her brain/thoughts.", "NTA.  It's not the content, but how the child reacts to the content, and if Julka is handling it then it's not harmful.  Probably.\n\nWhat's disturbing is your wife's reaction.  She seems quite irrational, controlling, and extreme.", "NTA.  Lots of parents think something is bad just because they said so, though they often have little to no evidence to support the claim unless \"I don't like that\" somehow counts as evidence.", "NTA your wife needs to chill out. Your daughter is obviously really enjoying the stories and you two are having a great bonding experience together. As long as she isn't having nightmares or exhibiting concerning behavior after hearing the stories it's fine.", "NTA, your wife is insanely strict and is going to actively fuck up your daughter if you continue to let her exert this level of control over your lives", "NTA. Horror is a genre that exists for a reason. And most children tend to love horror, even when it scares them. \n\nHere's a question to pose for your wife.\n\nIf your daughter has never been scared, how will she know how to deal with it when she is?", "NTA Your child likes the horror genre and that's entirely fine. There isn't anything suggesting children (especially 10 and up) can't enjoy age appropriate horror so I have no idea what your wife is talking about.\n\nIt sounds like she personally has an issue with it and is asserting her opinion as fact.", "I'm sorry, but Everyone Sucks except the child. She's at a point when she should be able to either decide on her own or at least have a part deciding her reading material at her free time. She's growing and and she should be able to get more independent", "I was reading VC Andrews at that age. Nothing more degenerate then incest rape and porn. All wrapped up in the tales of kids not much older then i was when reading. I don\u2019t think i turned out bad. Or have a warped sense of morality because of it. Don\u2019t like the books now cuz i actually understand what the content is about. But it was one of the few books that actually got me into reading. So my parents had conversations with me about the topics i was reading instead of banning them.", "NTA I read tons of goosebumps books and scary stories to tell in the dark as a kid because I liked it lol.", "Is this poor kid allowed to read on her own or choose her own reading material? She\u2019s ten- it\u2019s reasonable that she have some choice here. ESH.", "ESH. I would say N T A but you probably should have told your wife that you were doing this once you stepped over the line into horror and away from just \"scary.\" You know she doesn't like it, and at the very least you would have had the opportunity there to explain your reasoning as you did here. Now it really just seems like you went behind her back on purpose.\n\nOn her end, banning you from reading to your daughter altogether seems really extreme. There has to be a way to rectify this that doesn't prohibit quality time with your own daughter. (I also personally disagree with her stance -- kids are capable of being interested in and engaged by darker material without it indicating something sinister).", "ESH\n\nShe's ten.

Apart from the content, one of the issues was that I read to her in a stimulating manner, making sound effects (like thumping on the table with the heartbeat in \"The Tell-Tale Heart\"), giving different characters different voices. Basia apparently reads in a very clear, straightforward voice without such effects. Julka told me she likes my way of reading more, and I feel really bad about it.", "This. So very much this. \n\nYour wife is actively denying your daughter the things she likes. To the point where your daughter isn't even engaged in life anymore. Ask your wife if she thinks that is healthy, and how she would advise a parent to act.", "Reading on her own, yes.\n\nBedtime readings, also yes. I asked her \"what kind of stories would you like\", and she would say \"about X\" or \"like Y but maybe with more Z\". Then I'd make three suggestions and tell briefly what each story will be about, and she would choose.", "Basia is okay with assigned readings at school, because these are all high literature in her opinion.", "The daughter lol", "I'm sorry but your wife is mad because you made it *fun* for her? As someone with a daughter myself I can't help but be angry about this even though I don't know you or your daughter.  Having fun and playing is *vital* to a child's development. It's how they build connections, learn, and develope interests and passions. \n\nI'm honestly a little afraid for your daughter now.  This sounds like an entirely outdated child-rearing experiment that could *seriously* damage her. \n\nPlease STAND YOUR GROUND for you daughter and DO NOT allow this. \n\nMake life fun for her.  That's how life should be for a child.", "You're doing it right -- your kid is ten and allowed to have emotions like \"excitement\" okay?", "Why isn\u2019t your kid allowed to read on her own?", "When I was in 5th grade (10/11yo), we had a teacher who read to us at the end of the day, if we were good. He read us Old Yeller in a southern accent, Call it Courage, and so many more, all with dramatic styling in his voice. It made the stories come alive, and made us think about what the characters were experiencing. He remains my favorite childhood teacher. We were in no way overstimulated, but our minds were opened to the possibilities of other peoples lives and choices.", "Doesn't sound like she's been engaged in life since 3 really! Which is just the saddest thing I've read in a little while, when an interest supported by dad could so easily bring out that sparkle that makes kids worth it all.  It's right there waiting for engagement she is aching for it, just to be denied by one of the people meant to love her most in the world. \n\nSomething icky about taking your work as a child psychologist home in this sense and then alienating another parents views as they arent a professional. It's a kid not a case study. And I'm sure if you barely allow any fun or interests that aren't under the curriculum they might be studious and do well in school (if they don't significantly rebel or struggle to feel engaged in anything once a teen and become even more disengaged with life). But it's not like parenting is black or white, or even beige. You can have a kid that is happy and smart.\n\nShe isn't going to become a moron if she experiences joy and passion for things that aren't bland or purely educational. It isn't that simple making intelligent and well rounded people. So busy being a child psychologist she's forgetting to be a mum.", "That kid is going to rebel so hard in a few years!", "So if she wanted to read horror or fantasy or sci fi on her own would that be allowed or would she be restricted to the same type of books you read aloud.", "I'm a teacher and most of the stuff we read isn't \"higher literature\" at that age. It's stuff that is fun, well-written and they enjoy reading.\n\nFrom a developmental point, we're trying to instill a love of reading in kids and education is shifting towards kids have choices in what they read and reading for both academics and fun.", "I don't have control over which books she has in her room to read on her own. Basia does. \n\nThere are two types of books Julka has access to:\n\n1- happy, light-hearted kid and ya books approved by Basia as appropriate, available in Julka's room to read all the time\n\n2- the \"grown-up\" books to \"improve her brain\" during nighttime readings, which are kept in our bedroom or in the living room - she can also read them on her own\n\nThere are also my books which I keep in the basement because they upset Basia when she sees them.\n\nJulka can read fantasy and sci-fi on her own, some of the books in her room are in these genres. She can't read horror on her own, but that is Basia's opinion, not mine, and I submit to her in child rearing. Except for the incident this post is about.", "Yes, most of it is kid-lit in our country too, like Jan Brzechwa's \"Mister Blot's Academy\" (Akademia Pana Kleksa) or Ignacy Krasicki's fairytales. There are some \"fancier\" things, like Adam Mickewicz's \"Sir Thaddeus\" (Pan Tadeusz) which is an epic rhymed poem about Polish nobility under Russian occupation.\n\nBasia believes that everything assigned at school is high literature. It's not that these books are complicated, but that they have good morals and impact the brain positively. Low literature can be complicated or simple, but it is \"like junk food for the brain\", her words.", "Your daughter is getting to an age where she should start having control over what she reads and the media she consumes. The amount of control your wife has over both of you in this regards is actually very concerning.\n\nThat isn't healthy.", ">Low literature can be complicated or simple, but it is \"like junk food for the brain\", her words.\n\nThis 100% isn't a thing and is a very out-dated, pretentious notion.\n\nAlso a book's \"morality\" or \"lessons\" has nothing to do with how it's academically handled. A large percentage of classics don't teach good morals but are just art reflecting the human experience.", "Kids just need to read what they like. In doing so they gain new vocabulary and fluency and speed - all crucial.  \n\nLook, if she loves epic Russian poetry fine.  But that needs a whole host of studying to delve into and 'get'. Leave that to school unless she picks it.  \n\nThere is nothing more effective at crushing a child's love of reading than forcing them to read stuff thats not their thing.  \n\nAll of us have had the experience of someone suggesting a book to us as being perfect and it sits unread for months because it's not our thing."]}
