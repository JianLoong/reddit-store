Still went on to scale the heights of literature, and didn\u2019t turn out a serial killer.", "Much of Polish folklore was based on scary tales, though? (My grandmother could make reading the Bible scarier than Dracula.) And my point is that unless your child is frightened and doesn't want these kinds of stories read to her, ultimately she will evolve and read more complex and alternative literature. \n\nMy husband is a psychiatrist and he would inhibit reading material if the child is upset by the genre.\n\nSo, NTA. Plus a 10-year-old is ready to start reading to herself before she goes to sleep.", "NTA.  You are creating amazing memories with her that she will cherish forever.  You are helping her develop her personality and learn what she loves.  Like your wife, I am a therapist for children and teens.  Unlike your wife, I believe what you are doing is helping her development and her depriving your daughter of time with you and stories she loves will be detrimental to her development and create resentment towards your wife.", "Degenerate art is a Nazi coined term.  No art is degenerate.  Art just reflects people.

Especially when Basia is giving you changing signals, going from \"I trust your judgment to choose appropriate stories\" to \"you're not allowed to read to her anymore because I don't trust your judgment.\"   \n\n\n>She said I\u2019m putting degenerate stuff in Julka\u2019s brain, traumatising and  \n overstimulating her, and destroying the development of her personality.\n\nAs a child psychologist, Basia should have a better grasp on why horror themes are *developmentally appropriate* for Julkas age. \n\nAround middle school age (which would be 11-14 in the US), children are commonly fascinated by gore and horror. This is normal. At this age, they are becoming more aware of the things going on in the world. They hear and read about violence, crimes, war, and so on. They are learning that the world can be a very scary place. \n\nExploring these themes in horror stories, *especially when these are guided by and discussed with a parent*, gives them a chance to explore their emotions in a safe setting. It allows them to explore themes, such as good guys vs. bad guys, and develop a better understanding of concepts like justice and morality. \n\nAdditionally, since the child has the option of putting away the book or asking the parent to stop reading, it allows them to control how much they are exposed to and to say \"I don't like this\" when it becomes overwhelming.\n\nYou have found something that has raised Julka's interest and that is appropriate for her age. As long as you are selective in the stories you're picking, horror content is appropriate. You *do* want to avoid large amounts of gore and focus on stories that  have a \"good\" ending (rather than one that is ambivalent or where the hero dies).\n\nDefinitely NTA here.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou actually asked your wife if she was ok with you reading to your kid the other stories and she didn't object and i think her deciding you are not allowed to read to your kid anymore is not ok.\n\n\nYour kid, like any other kid, is probably excite to read something that was not allowed until recently and I think putting it back in the \"forbidden\" list will just make her interest in it grown even more.", "NTA. Basia makes a lot of sweeping judgements, so it worries me that she's a child psychologist", "NTA. It's generally considered good for a child to find something that resonates with them. Has your wife offered any evidence for her assertion?", "NTA. If you were reading her those stories for your own enjoyment despite her terror, that would be another story. But she clearly enjoys it. She\u2019s 10, she could probably check out a horror book from the library with no one knowing. She\u2019s allowed to enjoy what she enjoys if it\u2019s not genuinely inappropriate or something that would affect her brain/thoughts.", "NTA.  It's not the content, but how the child reacts to the content, and if Julka is handling it then it's not harmful.  Probably.\n\nWhat's disturbing is your wife's reaction.  She seems quite irrational, controlling, and extreme.", "NTA.  Lots of parents think something is bad just because they said so, though they often have little to no evidence to support the claim unless \"I don't like that\" somehow counts as evidence.", "NTA your wife needs to chill out. Your daughter is obviously really enjoying the stories and you two are having a great bonding experience together. As long as she isn't having nightmares or exhibiting concerning behavior after hearing the stories it's fine.", "NTA, your wife is insanely strict and is going to actively fuck up your daughter if you continue to let her exert this level of control over your lives", "NTA. Horror is a genre that exists for a reason. And most children tend to love horror, even when it scares them. \n\nHere's a question to pose for your wife.\n\nIf your daughter has never been scared, how will she know how to deal with it when she is?", "NTA Your child likes the horror genre and that's entirely fine. There isn't anything suggesting children (especially 10 and up) can't enjoy age appropriate horror so I have no idea what your wife is talking about.\n\nIt sounds like she personally has an issue with it and is asserting her opinion as fact.", "I'm sorry, but Everyone Sucks except the child. She's at a point when she should be able to either decide on her own or at least have a part deciding her reading material at her free time. She's growing and and she should be able to get more independent", "I was reading VC Andrews at that age. Nothing more degenerate then incest rape and porn. All wrapped up in the tales of kids not much older then i was when reading. I don\u2019t think i turned out bad. Or have a warped sense of morality because of it. Don\u2019t like the books now cuz i actually understand what the content is about. But it was one of the few books that actually got me into reading. So my parents had conversations with me about the topics i was reading instead of banning them.", "NTA I read tons of goosebumps books and scary stories to tell in the dark as a kid because I liked it lol.", "Is this poor kid allowed to read on her own or choose her own reading material? She\u2019s ten- it\u2019s reasonable that she have some choice here. ESH.", "ESH. I would say N T A but you probably should have told your wife that you were doing this once you stepped over the line into horror and away from just \"scary.\" You know she doesn't like it, and at the very least you would have had the opportunity there to explain your reasoning as you did here. Now it really just seems like you went behind her back on purpose.\n\nOn her end, banning you from reading to your daughter altogether seems really extreme. There has to be a way to rectify this that doesn't prohibit quality time with your own daughter. (I also personally disagree with her stance -- kids are capable of being interested in and engaged by darker material without it indicating something sinister).", "ESH\n\nShe's ten.

How can she give them healthy coping mechanisms when she barely believes in simple pleasures?", "Yeah if this were my childhood I would've been so intensely bored. You bet I would've found all the gory, awful stuff wayyy more fascinating because it was forbidden too. The wife here is creating a future horror/thriller buff but can't even see it because she's apparently convinced that kids should have no fun at all because it's \"overstimulating\" or whatever. She's 10, it's fiction, not an active crime scene or a rave jfc lady.", "I'm sorry, but your wife sounds like an absolutely *terrible* child psychologist. Every one I know realizes the developmental role of imaginative play, and that includes acting stories out. It also includes teaching children the difference between fantasy and reality, and to be frank, it doesn't seem like your wife has mastered that. Everything she is saying is bonkers, and I feel so profoundly sorry for your daughter.\n\nFWIW, age 10 is the perfect age for getting into Poe, Hawthorne,  Lovecraft, and other \"light\" horror.

The only argument had was when i was reading a book my dad wanted to read!", "Honestly, YTA --- if your wife is strongly against horror themes, and she professionally works with kids who have a lot of problems, then for the sake of peace in the house ---- why not switch to Harry Potter?  Kids love magic themes, and there's a bit of horror and suspense in there but not anything bloody, gory or unnecessary.  \n\nI'm sure your daughter loves being read to, the attention and your special effects.

It was so exciting that I constantly reread them too.  I read anything I wanted that was in the library.   I read the stories of O Henry also.

Is there a plan for giving Julka more control as she ages?\n\nWhen I was Julka\u2019s age, my mother would monitor some of the \u201colder\u201d books I read and sometimes read them to so she could talk to me about the content in them (violence, substances, etc). But by the time I was 14 I was in control of the books I read and could read basically any \u201cadult\u201d books I wanted. \n\nMy dad read out loud to me when I was around that age.

There's still the school library, borrowing from friends, the internet... when I was around Julka's age I read the Wikipedia plot synopsis for most of Stephen King's books and most episodes of the Twilight Zone because I wasn't allowed either but Wikipedia was approved as an educational site. Then I moved onto articles about real life crimes and tragedies- I probably would've been better off with Goosebumps than covertly learning about sex crimes and school shootings before I hit puberty. Being the one to provide \"scary\" media to your kid means you can filter it for the stuff that you *really* don't want, and that you can have discussions about the borderline stuff instead of her keeping it secret and getting anxious or having nightmares. I'm not traumatized by any of my preteen scary reading, but it definitely added to my anxiety back then. Your wife is wrong about this being a bad sign, too- it can do more damage to rob a kid of something they're excited and passionate about for arbitrary reasons than to let them read a little bit of horror.", "lol calm and neutral is not a healthy way to raise a kid. it sounds like your wife doesn't even really understand the brain mechanisms that cause low attention in some of the kids she works with. tiktok is making some kids AWFUL but ADHD and attention issues exist without social media. \n\nshe's allowed to be excited about and engaged with what she's listening to! she's allowed to have emotions and colors about that!\n\ni think a LOT of this has way more to do with your wife's preferred \"aesthetics\" and how she thinks a kid SHOULD be than the actual needs of her living, breathing child. \n\nalso it's very controlling and unhealthy for her  to ban you from reading to your own kid. you do not have to listen to her on that, tho i would encourage trying to talk it out. if she keeps dismissing you bc it's \"not your field,\" get counseling because she's demeaning you in a really inappropriate way. \n\nNTA", "Everything you have said about your wife in these comments makes me massively worried for her patients, that is how weird and out of touch with reality it is.

You remind me of my dad, who used to read to my sister and I in the evenings when we were kids. He readmostly fantasy (the Harry Potter series was a big one), but he was very animated when he read to us and we absolutely loved it. Also, I live in the US and started reading Edgar Allan Poe when I was in 6th grade... FOR SCHOOL (I was 10 just like your daughter.) We had an entire unit dedicated to Poe in my Language Arts class, and we even had an assignment where we had to memorize a portion of \"The Raven\" and recite it in front of the class. I can still recite my assigned portion to this day (I'm 30, lol). My dad helped me rehearse and gave me lots of pointers (like emphasizing certain words, pausing for dramatic affect, etc.) I got an A+. I absolutely fell in love with Poe and horror literature after that class. And you know what? BOTH of my parents gave me lots of recommendations for other authors and scary books  to read after that, because they saw how much I enjoyed it.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. Your wife is being very overprotective IMO and I hope you are able to come to some sort of compromise. Historically speaking, the horror genre has often been labeled as \"degenerate\" and \"trash\", when in reality it is truly it's own unique art form and it's a shame that your wife has such archaic beliefs. It sounds like your daughter really enjoyed your reading to her and it breaks my heart a little that your wife has taken that away from you both. Maybe she's even a bit jealous that your daughter prefers your reading style over hers?", "So, also not a child psychologist, but the whole point of having my parents read to me as a kid was to give us a chance to bond and share interests. \n\nAdditionally, it was also a way for my parents to introduce me to a variety of things so that I could learn what I DID like and could later pick out for myself to read. It sounds like by limiting what subjects she's exposed to and not giving her anything exciting or stimulating she's depriving her of that chance to learn about herself and grow.", ">Basia says that being a kid is about safety and stability\n\nAs parents, you provide that stability in response to life's chaos.

If that\u2019s  how it worked, my daughter would believe there was a short tempered pegasus, a gnome with golden underpants, an alcoholic octopus and Irish alligators running wild in our town.", "This exactly, the reason I fell in love with reading as a kid is because I read adventure novels that helped me develop that kind of immersive vision when reading less fantastical stuff. \n\nOP, NTA and let your child develop their own pallet for the kinds of stories they want to read and encourage them along that journey. Not everyone has the same taste and interests, and while it's great that your wife wants to encourage reading, only allowing books that are to her tastes will definitely stifle your daughter's interest."]}
