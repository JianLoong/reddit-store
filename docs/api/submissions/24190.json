He sold his car 2 months ago and is currently saving for a new one - or so I thought. We live in the Caribbean.\n\nLast night he came over and asked me what I thought about him using his car money to start a car wash. I told him that he can use the space he has at home to open a car wash and he doesn\u2019t necessarily need to use all his money to open a business as simple as that. \n\nHe said the vision he has is to also include auto detailing and that he would use the money to purchase equipment for it. \n\nI told him that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea - but I\u2019ll support him if he decides to do it. \n\nHe then said that he\u2019s happy I\u2019m on his side because he wants us to do something together. \n\nI thought he meant me helping with his business - but no. He explained that his idea of \u201ctogether\u201d is me taking out a loan for a car that will be on MY NAME but he will drive it because I don\u2019t drive. \n\nWhen I asked who will be making the payments, he said the bank will take the money out of my account every month and he will pay half. \n\nI told him that I am absolutely NOT paying half for a car I am not driving. He said it would be \u201cour\u201d car and that when I eventually get my license, I\u2019ll be able to drive it too. \n\nI said that this entire scenario makes no sense as I have no intention of driving anytime soon - and literally anything can happen. \n\nI asked if we break up, what then? \n\nHe said even if we break up, he will continue paying for his share of the share so I won\u2019t bare that payment. When I asked why he can\u2019t just pay for the full payment he said he plans to leave his job and do his car wash / detailing business full time so he won\u2019t be able to cover the full payment until his business takes off.\n\nI told him that I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t take out a loan for him - nor put a car in my name when he is so unstable. He called me a \u201cselfish AH\u201d - one he \u201ccan\u2019t see a future with\u201d and left. Now, he won\u2019t speak to me. My mom says I\u2019m in the right but now I feel bad because if I don\u2019t take out the loan, he won\u2019t be able to. AITA?\n\n**UPDATE**\nHi guys, thank you so much for giving your opinions, stories, advice - everything! I truly appreciate it and it helped make my decision a lot easier.\n\nSo, he called me earlier and broke up with me on the basis of \u201cpartners are supposed to share everything\u201d and he can\u2019t trust me to \u201chold him down when he\u2019s down.\u201d After an ear full about how I \u201cthink I\u2019m better than him because of my job,\u201d how I \u201clook down on him,\u201d and how I \u201cdon\u2019t want to see him be successful,\u201d I called his mom (we\u2019re very close) and let her know that we broke up and why we broke up. \n\nShe was very upset to say the least - but reassured me that I made the right decision. She said that she told him not to sell the car but he went ahead and did it anyway. \n\nAfter we spoke, she wished me well and I went to get something to eat. \nI guess she told him something about it because he texted me shortly after. I\u2019m just going to copy and paste what he said:\n\n**TEXT CONVO** \n\nHim: How childish do you have to be to call my mom?\n\nMe: I wanted her to know that we broke up and why.\n\nHim: Just say you wanted to manipulate her and make her believe I\u2019m trying to leech off of you. WHAT HAVE YOU EVER FONE FOR ME? TELL ME\n\nHim: You know what\u2019s sad? You were supposed to be the person I could come to for ANYTING. I had my own car something YOU NEVER HAD and I sold it because it was getting to expensive and I wanted something more efficient. YOU KNOW THAT so I don\u2019t know why you trying to fuck up what my family thinks about me and make me look like I BEGGING you for car.\n\nHim: SMH you are the biggest asshole and the most selfish person I ever met\n\nHim: Why couldn\u2019t you just be happy for me? Why couldn\u2019t you just believe in my dreams? You really think I would leave you after you got a car for me? You have no common sense and that\u2019s why people will USE you. You to dumb for an educated woman and that\u2019s why we broke up. Go tell her that\n\n**END OF TEXT CONVO** \n\nYeah\u2026 lol. I didn\u2019t respond to any of those messages. But I did get a massive headache immediately after reading them. \n\nAnyway, thanks a lot for all your help guys!

Your boyfriend is a bum, you deserve better.", "NTA - and really, you're dodging a bullet here.\n\nWhat if we break up?  Yeah he is NOT going to keep paying.  Its in your name, he can walk away from it at any time, which will probably be sooner then later...\n\nDo NOT put your name on a loan for anything you are not fully willing to pay for.", "NTA\n\nHe's probably lying about paying for any of it", "I've said this on Reddit before and I'll say it again, DO NOT take out any type of loan with someone you aren't legally married/bound to. No car loan, no joint credit card, no mortgage.", "NTA. It's not your fault he doesn't have a better plan.", "NTA.\n\nRed flag. I'm not sure how laws might be different in the Caribbean, but in the U.S. for example, having your name on a car's title and having your name on the car loan are completely separate issues. Whoever has their name on the title has ownership rights to the car.  Whoever has their name on the loan is responsible for repayment REGARDLESS of whether they have any rights to the car. \n\nSo, if absolutely have to go through with this, *which you shouldn't*, the car should be in your name and your name ALONE. That way, if you break up (or his business fails), you can sell or return the car and pay off the loan. \n\nIf you decide to take out a loan, you need to execute a separate agreement with your boyfriend that states that he agrees to pay you back for the loan, the period of time, and you should charge interest (see what your jurisdiction requires for personal loans), otherwise this might be considered a gift which would have tax implications. You'll need this agreement in case he bolts, so that you can sue him to enforce repayment.\n\nFinally, he seems pretty flakey so you should insist that if he's going to start a business, he should go through the formal steps to incorporate one. If he isn't willing to do this, it will be easier to shut down his request for money. Plus, he might need permits, etc. so it will force him to do some due diligence. \n\nMore importantly, if he incorporates, he can probably treat the loan repayments as business expenses (rather than personal expenses). That will avoid potential double taxation. Long story short, before you do anything **you need to consult a lawyer**. He needs to consult a lawyer to ensure that he sets up his business correctly. You also need a lawyer to set up a contract for the repayment of this loan.\n\nUltimately, though, he seems like a flake so insisting that you do this the \"right way\" is probably enough of a hurdle to shut this whole conversation down.

This is YOUR credit, YOUR ability to buy your own car eventually, or get an apartment, or a mortgage. Getting a loan for him to have a car that you will not drive makes no sense, but it also puts you in a position where you can be screwed. Please don't make the mistake I did. What if he decides he doesn't have the money to help with payments? Nothing you can do, you're responsible for the whole payment. Who is paying for insurance? WHat happens if he gets in an accident?
