He sold his car 2 months ago and is currently saving for a new one - or so I thought. We live in the Caribbean.\n\nLast night he came over and asked me what I thought about him using his car money to start a car wash. I told him that he can use the space he has at home to open a car wash and he doesn\u2019t necessarily need to use all his money to open a business as simple as that. \n\nHe said the vision he has is to also include auto detailing and that he would use the money to purchase equipment for it. \n\nI told him that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea - but I\u2019ll support him if he decides to do it. \n\nHe then said that he\u2019s happy I\u2019m on his side because he wants us to do something together. \n\nI thought he meant me helping with his business - but no. He explained that his idea of \u201ctogether\u201d is me taking out a loan for a car that will be on MY NAME but he will drive it because I don\u2019t drive. \n\nWhen I asked who will be making the payments, he said the bank will take the money out of my account every month and he will pay half. \n\nI told him that I am absolutely NOT paying half for a car I am not driving. He said it would be \u201cour\u201d car and that when I eventually get my license, I\u2019ll be able to drive it too. \n\nI said that this entire scenario makes no sense as I have no intention of driving anytime soon - and literally anything can happen. \n\nI asked if we break up, what then? \n\nHe said even if we break up, he will continue paying for his share of the share so I won\u2019t bare that payment. When I asked why he can\u2019t just pay for the full payment he said he plans to leave his job and do his car wash / detailing business full time so he won\u2019t be able to cover the full payment until his business takes off.\n\nI told him that I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t take out a loan for him - nor put a car in my name when he is so unstable. He called me a \u201cselfish AH\u201d - one he \u201ccan\u2019t see a future with\u201d and left. Now, he won\u2019t speak to me.

Why couldn't he take out the car loan in his own name? Sounds like he was trying to use you and probably leave you hanging. I bet he's done this before. NTA.", "NTA - it's a terrible idea. Don't do it.", "NTA. Nope, nope, nope. You'll never see his half of the payment if you did this. It'll be a laundry list of excuses every single month.\n\nNo mixing finances with this person unless/until you're married AND he has a stable income or a successful business. Right now he has neither, just a pipe dream and plans of taking advantage of your financial stability.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but it sounds like he's trying to scam you or rip you off. Absolutely do not sign for this man's car.", "When people reveal themselves to you, believe them! NTA.", "NTA.  Run.", "Take the opportunity and run as far away from this person as you can.  He has shown big red flags.", "NTA. Tell him you cant see a future with him either and RUN!", "NTA - but you need a new BF this one is manipulative, abusive, and using you.", "Im pretty sure you haven't been more right than this.\nYou take the loan, you make the payments together and then you broke up. What will you do? It's your name on everything, you're the one who gotta pay, not him, legally.\n\nDump his ass. He's just interested in what he can get out of the relationship, not in you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nFuck no, you're taking all the risks here and for no reward. \n\nYou're basically giving him the kind of loan that the bank wouldn't, and for good reason.\n\nDo not do it. Nope, no, absolutely not.", "NTA!!! He\u2019s using you and trying to manipulate you. You would be making 100% of the car payments bc his business just can\u2019t swing the cost in the beginning. PLUS\u2026any tickets or any fines he get will be attached to the car. That means\u2026you would be responsible.", "NTA- He can get himself a car when his business takes off. He can also take out his own loan in his own name and make his own payments. You don\u2019t drive and have no plans to start, so what\u2019s the point of getting a car?", "NTA leave that boyfriend cause he waving them red flag.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to bear the burden of his poor financial choices. Why can't he take out his own loan?", "NTA, that sounds like a bad financial risk for you", "NTA. DON'T DO IT!!!!\n\nI was STUPID and did it for my now ex fiance. We split up a little over a year later, he let it get repossessed and it ruined my credit. At the time I could barely even afford to pay rent and utilities and eat so I had to file bankruptcy and it was awful. He ended up in prison so there was no way to get him to pay for anything. Biggest mistake of my life other than dating him in the first place. His reaction is over the top and you would be better off without him.", "NTA- you aren\u2019t running a charity to support your boyfriend. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t blend finances with anyone until you are married.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t do this.", "NTA. Do. Not. Do. I!!!\n\nEven if you do get a license. His reasoning is so....dumb. \"It's my car that only I will drive but *you'll* pay half b/c it'll be our car.\" Sir, please kick rocks with that.\n\nAlso, if you're ever bored, watch a few Judge Judy episodes about when a woman puts her bf's car loan in her name. Spoiler: It never ends well.", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to manipulate you into a deal that only benefits him and makes you assume all the risk.", "NTA\n\nDON\u2019T DO IT!\n\nYou will be financially responsible.", "Haha. Good one.\n\nHell no.", "Don\u2019t feel bad!!! You did the right thing. People have to accept there will be No\u2019s in life. Good riddance", "NTA.  Girl, you didn't just dodge a bullet, you dodged an air missile.  He wasn't going to give you money for payments, because 'his car was is still getting established, can't you cover for me?'\n\nHe wanted you to buy him a car so he could quit his job and pursue a bad idea.  Simple as that.\n\nIf he really really wanted to open a business then he would keep working until he saved up enough to actually have to start it.  Instead he wants to half ass it so he can quit his job right away and lean on everyone in his life for money.\n\nHe's probably going to go out and find a different girl he thinks he can scam into buying him a car.  He'll tell her lots of stories about his uptight ex who never supported him or believed in his dream, which will teach her exactly what behaviors he finds bad (having a spine and financial sense).", "No way, no how. Do not finance a car for anyone. He can get another sucker on the line.", "He is a gold digger!! You made the right call. Stand your ground, don\u2019t let someone convince you that a bad idea is a good one. NTA", "No it\u2019s actually called being smart. \ud83d\udc4f Bravo!", "NTA. Such a request would put doubts in any person's mind. Why would you pay half for a car he drives? It could kind of make (some) sense if he made the entire payment. But above all, if he is employed, why can't he take a loan in his name?", "NTA , male gold digger", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9Crisis averted.", "He doesn\u2019t have a stable job with an income coming in every month so the banks won\u2019t consider him. His family has a grocery so he works with them and makes a little money - but not enough to take out a loan.", "I'll second that. \n\nAnd third, fourth, fifth........and one thousandth. \n\nDO NOT DO THIS.  You will be stuck with the price of a car that you don't drive, while boyfriend swans off to wherever he's off to.  And your credit rating will tank.", "Hi, I was explaining on another comment that he doesn\u2019t have a stable income so the banks won\u2019t consider him. In my county, one of the requirements for a loan is a letter from your job stating how much you make each month. His numbers always fluctuate. Some months he doesn\u2019t even work.", "Ah, gotcha. Still, bad idea to give him access to that kind of money, especially in your name. You're absolutely right for standing your ground!", "So let your comment sink in. He doesn\u2019t have a stable job with a stable income. So how is he going to pay for even half of the car payment?"]}
