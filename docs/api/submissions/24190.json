Your boyfriend is a bum, you deserve better.", "NTA - and really, you're dodging a bullet here.\n\nWhat if we break up?  Yeah he is NOT going to keep paying.  Its in your name, he can walk away from it at any time, which will probably be sooner then later...\n\nDo NOT put your name on a loan for anything you are not fully willing to pay for.", "NTA\n\nHe's probably lying about paying for any of it", "I've said this on Reddit before and I'll say it again, DO NOT take out any type of loan with someone you aren't legally married/bound to. No car loan, no joint credit card, no mortgage.", "NTA. It's not your fault he doesn't have a better plan.", "NTA.\n\nRed flag. I'm not sure how laws might be different in the Caribbean, but in the U.S. for example, having your name on a car's title and having your name on the car loan are completely separate issues. Whoever has their name on the title has ownership rights to the car.  Whoever has their name on the loan is responsible for repayment REGARDLESS of whether they have any rights to the car. \n\nSo, if absolutely have to go through with this, *which you shouldn't*, the car should be in your name and your name ALONE. That way, if you break up (or his business fails), you can sell or return the car and pay off the loan. \n\nIf you decide to take out a loan, you need to execute a separate agreement with your boyfriend that states that he agrees to pay you back for the loan, the period of time, and you should charge interest (see what your jurisdiction requires for personal loans), otherwise this might be considered a gift which would have tax implications. You'll need this agreement in case he bolts, so that you can sue him to enforce repayment.\n\nFinally, he seems pretty flakey so you should insist that if he's going to start a business, he should go through the formal steps to incorporate one. If he isn't willing to do this, it will be easier to shut down his request for money. Plus, he might need permits, etc. so it will force him to do some due diligence. \n\nMore importantly, if he incorporates, he can probably treat the loan repayments as business expenses (rather than personal expenses). That will avoid potential double taxation. Long story short, before you do anything **you need to consult a lawyer**. He needs to consult a lawyer to ensure that he sets up his business correctly. You also need a lawyer to set up a contract for the repayment of this loan.\n\nUltimately, though, he seems like a flake so insisting that you do this the \"right way\" is probably enough of a hurdle to shut this whole conversation down. Then, you can dump him at your convenience.", "NTA\n\nSo let me get this right, he's going to quit his current job, to open a detailing business that he's got nothing for, and he think that it'll be such an amazing success of the bat, he can afford a new car on finance? \n\nIf he thinks he can start this detailing job, without it being a side hustle until his name gets out there, frankly he is delusional. \n\nAs someone very into cars etc, no one aside from the soccer mums who's kids have destroyed the car will be going to him for a good while. \n\nWhen it all falls apart, your the only one with an income and stuck with a car on finance you don't want, can't drive and that he won't be able to refinance to get it out of your name. \n\nHe wants it, he gets it himself.", "He sounds selfish AF!

Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, him having a car doesn\u2019t benefit me at all. \n\nWe live an hour away from each other and he stopped driving down to me last year to save gas. Instead, I take a taxi to meet him in a place closer to where he lives (10-15 minutes away from him) and he meets me there and takes me back to his home. Which is why none of this is making sense. \n\nThe thing is - I can get a discount on the car because of where I work and the maintenance will be covered for 2 years by the company. \n\nHe also knows that I can afford to pay the payment in full if he misses one and I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s banking on. \n\nSorry for ranting. It\u2019s just everything is coming together in my brain", "Nope. Seen enough Judge Judy. They never post after the breakup. Usually they try to make the break up as ugly as possible, too, to use that as a justification for why they don\u2019t pay.", "Hi, I\u2019m from Trinidad and Tobago. It\u2019s the first time he asked me to do something so big. Other times were small but frequently like me paying for food 95% of the time, buying him necessities (hair care, body care, clothes etc) and he would pay for food occasionally or buy a nice gift for me on my birthday. Sometimes he would ask me to pay for something and say that he\u2019ll pay me back when he sees me. He usually pretends he forgets and I just don\u2019t bring it up.  \n\nI won\u2019t be able to check him at the moment as he has blocked me on all social media accounts lol I\u2019m appalled. But I do expect him to come back after he calmed down so maybe then. \n\nI do think it\u2019s time to start running though. Everything is becoming clearer as I think about it. Especially because since he sold his car, he hasn\u2019t even done anything for me - but spends money wildly.", "Likely he'd keep the car, stop making any payments, and gf will get a call from the bank (after making thousands in half payments).", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Many, many of my friends did that for smaller things (phones from carriers, co-signer for loans, lease agreements) and often end up paying or have execution issued on them.\n\nAnd I repeat DO NOT DO IT. It will be on your record if he flunks and it will be up to you to pay. Also something like 2/3rds or more businesses go under within first 5 years.", "If he hurts or kills someone, you're going to be the one financially ruined. Dump the grifter.", "Same here and I thought you had to have a license to be able to buy a car?", "Sucks to suck then. Guess who\u2019s SOL", "I didn\u2019t even read the post after that headline. No need. DO NOT DO IT!!! You will be kicking yourself, and he will be congratulating himself if you break up. He will absolutely not keep up the payments!", "In that case, he should ask his family to take out a loan against their business. Shift the burden to them. \n\nIf he can't do that, it's probably because THEY know he won't follow through on his plans or won't pay them back.", "You can go ahead and be happy you don\u2019t have to talk to him anymore.", "You go and change your locks if he has a key.\nStop calling him, call your friends instead.", "Do the same to him and move on... you deserve better...", "It was years ago and hes in prison rotting away and I am happily married to man 10x the man he ever was, so I think I came out on top. Please, please, listen to all of us. Your emotions are clouding things right now, but think about how he has made you feel with his actions. Someone like that is no good for you.", "My friend, sometimes seeing it in writing clarifies thoughts and lets you make feelings more concrete.  So rant away.\n\nYour dude doesn\u2019t want to pay for gas now, is he going to pay for gas later?  You\u2019re paying the taxi fees, so you do the math on if the payment will save you money (assume you\u2019re paying the whole thing).  And most cars require little maintenance the first two years, but after the warranty is up, I swear they know (says a person that just spent 3k on brakes and tires).  Plus, insurance and you have to cover him and yourself.  Probably requires full coverage then.  Cars aren\u2019t cheap, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how laws are in your country (you said Caribbean, but not which nation) but in the US, if there\u2019s an accident, the legal owner of the car can be sued.  A family member of mine lent his car to his best friend and he rear ended someone.  Guess whose name was on the lawsuit\u2026", "This. \n\nChances are, if he can't hold a job down, he will also not be able to pay you.  Then you will be responsible for paying the whole car off.  He is asking you for a favor, you can say \"no\".  You don't owe him this.  Him getting mad is a red flag, it shows that he is willing to be selfish and not think about what is best for you.  It also shows that he thinks you owe him something.  This is not good for a relationship."]}
