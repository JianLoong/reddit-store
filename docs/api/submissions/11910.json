I\u2019ve always been friendly to her but more often than not, she will often not acknowledge me with a greeting when I\u2019m at her register, and will often ignore me when I greet her. occasionally she will respond when I greet her and I ask how she is doing but her replies will either be terse and hostile or rude or sarcastic, despite the fact that she may have been friendly to the person before me or immediately after me. I\u2019m in the US for context and so this behavior is not cultural.\n\nMy mother said she has been that way on occasion with her as well, though maybe tad friendlier as my mother is in there daily. My mother happened to be behind me paying separately during my last encounter in which the cashier was rude to me and when I breached the subject with my mother she had noted that the cashier told her she was having a bad day. \n\nI understand bad days and that working in customer service can be taxing. I\u2019ve worked in it myself. But this woman is rude to me more often than not and when I worked in customer service, I was never rude to a customer, particularly someone who had always been polite to me. A customer might be having a bad day as well even if they don\u2019t seem to be. You never know what someone is really dealing with. I\u2019ve walked in there having horrible days and this lady has just made them so much worse by treating me poorly when I did not treat her that way, particularly since I have been a victim of bullying and people treating me poorly without just cause in the past, and I\u2019m tired of being treated poorly by people I\u2019ve treated well. I try to use another cashier when possible or self check out but those are not always options.\n\nI\u2019ve previously put in a good word to management for good customer service from other employees at this shop. I\u2019m thinking I should also report employees who are down right rude without just cause.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdited for clarity.\n\nUpdate: The consensus seems to be that I would be the asshole for reporting her so I will just avoid her and wait for the self check if she is the only cashier available.\n\nUpdate to answer questions:\n\nYes, being polite is part of her job description.\nNo, I did not look that up before people here brought it up.\nNo, it is not just that she doesn\u2019t say hello. She is blatantly hostile.\nNo, I am not just imagining it. I have witnesses who concure.\nNo, she is not like this to everyone. She will be rude or hostile to me and then immediately polite to her coworkers. She seems a little more polite with other customers but it\u2019s difficult to tell because I don\u2019t stand around and watch.\nYes, I am an ethic minority that is subjected to hate, but a lot of people can\u2019t tell my ethnicity.\nNo, I do not know if this is why she treats me poorly and I would not make that accusation without significantly substantial proof. \n\nHappy judging.", "created_utc": 1678391325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n1s1n/wibta_if_i_reported_this_cashiers_for_being_rude/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My first and biggest thought is why is this so important to you. It seems like such a petty thing to report: \"Boohoo, my cashier didn't smile at me.\" But the fact that you actually looked up her job description to use it against her is the very definition of petty.\n\nBeing a cashier is physically, mentally and emotionally exhausting, and I do mean EXHAUSTING! The fact that she is friendly with the person in front of you and the person behind you would indicate that it's likely you and not her. Maybe you don't know the difference between polite and friendly. \"Hi, how are you!\" is not friendly, it's polite. Even with a smile. My mom used to call it a verbal handshake. Friendly would be (with genuine enthusiasm) \"Oh, I just love your top! (Or earrings, or hairstyle) Where did you get it?\" or my standby \"Hey, would you like to hear my joke!\" I'm sure you would get a much better reaction with that kind of tactic.", "Lolol the update !\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to leave this poor woman alone. Thank you for that. \n\nBut JEEZ! Self checkout was an option the whole time?!! You really were TA. Thank you for stopping.", "Info Op, what do you honestly want the outcome to be? \n\n The cashier being fired?  \n\nThe cashier being 'nicer' to you?  Complaining to her boss isn't going to endear you to her. \n\nI think you're really over thinking this.  Go, get your items,  and lose the small talk.  Clearly, she doesn't want to chat.", "Yes, YWBTA, as long as she takes your money and gives you stuff, she is doing her job. \n\nI agree it is awkward when someone is not reciprocating your friendliness, but that is not an offense to be made a big deal off.", "This is a whole lot. You see her every so often and she is not nice to you.  Let it go. I'm sure you have more important things to worry about. YWBTA", "Honestly it's pretty hard to remder a verdict without specifics on what she's doing that is so rude that it ruins your entire day. Not greeting you seems like an entitled thing to report someone over but I feel like there has to be more.", "Yes YWBTA. Stop greeting her and trying to make chit chat. Just let her ring up your purchases and you can go on your way. \n\nI used to go home from working retail with my face hurting from fake smiling all day. It sucks having to play at being happy all day just to make people like you think we're not being rude.", "YTA \u201cI\u2019m in the US so this behavior is not cultural\u201d depending on what part of the US it sure is. Leave her alone. She does her job. She doesn\u2019t need to be a social butterfly for customers.\n\nYour items are scanned and bagged appropriately? Why are you complaining.\n\nThis entitled behavior is probably why she doesn\u2019t talk to you specifically.", "YTA\n\nYou've built up a whole thing in your mind. \n\n> She seemed to warm up a bit to me once and I thought she was one of those people who takes time to warm up but then she went right back to being rude to me. Then she will immediately be friendly with a coworker. It\u2019s kind of difficult to see how she is with other customers aside from my mother because it would be strange for me to just stand around and watch her.\n\nThis is all fucking weird.  You don't have a relationship with this person.  You're talking about observing them at work and shit. \n\nThe totality of your post and your comments paints you firmly in the creepy category.  Maybe she's reading that.", "I would say yeah, YWBTA. But honestly, I can't imagine giving a shit lol. Why do you care so much if a cashier doesn't like you?", "YWBTA \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m from outside the US but it seems you guys have some weird entitled expectations of people in customer service roles.\n\nI\u2019ve never once cared that a cashier or server didn\u2019t smile at me or greet me in a way I found satisfactory. \n\n> A customer may be having a bad day, you never know what someone is dealing with.\n\nSame applies to her. Maybe she has chronic pain issues and is caring for a dying relative and has to do this job whilst feeling like absolute shit.", "Yes you'd be the AH.  Some people are introverts and don't want someone even asking how their day is going.  There is nothing wrong with that and she shouldn't have to have her livelihood threatened because you want to play Ms. Personality.  You're probably one of those people who hold up lines just to have meaningless conversations with service people and then walking away thinking how nice and gregarious you were when all you are doing in infringing upon other people's time.", "\u201cI\u2019m tired of being treated poorly by people I\u2019ve treated well.\u201d So just let her cash you out and go. You would be an asshole if you report her.", "Cashiers stand on their feet all day (in the U.S., that is. Don't know where you live.), have to deal with HUDREDS of people in a fast manner, and deal with a ton of issues like we all have, \n\nThey are underappreciated and expected to be on their best behaviour (apparently) at all times while they're working.\n\nForget that nonsense. As long as she's not shortchanging you or stealing your credit card info, be grateful.\n\nESPECIALLY considering you have other places to shop. Just go to them other places if this bothers you this much.\n\nSO yes, you would be TA if you reported her.", "YWBTA. Customer service and hospitality are NOT the same thing. It kind of irks me when people complain about a service because someone wasn\u2019t smiling and falling all over themselves to be friendly. She\u2019s not a fucking bartender or concierge at a hotel where part of the job is absolutely being friendly, accommodating, etc. It\u2019s a transaction. You want goods, bring to register. She charges you and bags them. You leave. As long as she\u2019s not over-charging you or refusing you service you can either deal with it or find another store.", "YTA, working retail is socially exhausting. Their job is to ring your shit up, not be your bestie.\n\n>>a customer could be having a bad day\n\n\nSo could the cashier? Don't know why it only goes one way.", "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t act like we\u2019re friends and she\u2019s happy to see me so I wanna report her to management \u201c\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s you", "it always surprises me when a customer service person is dismissive or rude, but if she's just doing her job in an unfriendly manner, YWBTA for reporting it to her manager. this woman is making almost no money and dealing with the unfiltered public all day long. it would be nice if she was nice, but unless she's offending you on purpose or saying something out of line, don't make it your business. and don't waste your energy letting her make your day worse. you said yourself she is also unfriendly to your mother, so it's not personal.", "YWBTA; stop expecting people to act how you\u2019d expect em to act and you\u2019ll be a lot happier. She\u2019s a cashier, not a server in a high class restaurant.", "Yes, obviously", "INFO: Besides not being overly bubbly or friendly, what exactly do they do that\u2019s rude? My judgement would depend on whether they are simply not smiling or chatting enough for your liking, or whether they\u2019ve done something actively offensive.\n\nETA \u2014 I saw your edit where you insist that she is \u201cblatantly hostile\u201d to you but still avoid giving any specifics or examples. Based on that, I\u2019m going with YTA until proven otherwise.", "YWBTA. It's not pleasant, but if all she does is not greet you/answer your greeting and generally not put on a \"customer service persona\" I don't think it warrants reporting. It'd be a different discussion if she was outright rude or insulting, but reporting her and potentially getting her fired over a missed hello is excessive.", "How much of detriment is this in your day? When you go to a store maybe once a week? Honestly. Yeah, rude people suck. Sure, you may have done something unintentionally to rub her the wrong way, and she just simply does not like you. Your brief interactions with her may be unpleasant, but you get to leave immediately after. The door is right there, bro. \n\nYou know what sucks even more? Her job. The low pay, the vast majority of customers, standing on her feet all day long. Being expected not only to be polite but also to kiss your butt and call it ice cream.\n\nSo yeah, reporting her, potentially getting her a write-up (or even terminated), would make you the AH. Unless this woman is screaming at you or berating you, just ignore and avoid her.", "I think your history of being bullied could be making you hyper vigilant and over analytical when it comes to peoples behavior towards you. \n\nIt\u2019s really easy to feel like you\u2019re being targeted when someone is really being an asshole to everyone. \n\nNAH, I get where you\u2019re coming from and your feelings are valid, AND more importantly, you\u2019ve decided not to report her. But there\u2019s also a chance she\u2019s not treating you differently from anyone else. \n\nINFO: can you think of any reason you\u2019d be targeted by her? Are you different from the usual costumers in any visually obvious way? OR is there any chance you\u2019ve possibly made a poor impression on the cashier that would cause her to treat you differently?", "YWBTA\n\nGo to the store, get your shit, pay, and go home. A cashier is not your friend. She's not there to brighten your day or stroke your ego.  \n\nIt's nice if they do, but if you're such a delicate flower that every person you randomly encounter has to kiss you ass or you crumble, then stay home.", "Okay, I\u2019m going to get downvoted for this, but absolutely report when she\u2019s rude. I work in CS in a grocery store and watching over cashiers is one of my duties. We give rewards for good service, which I freely give out. She won\u2019t get fired, just talked to, in all likelihood.", "Lol, imagine feeling entitled to people's friendship.\nShe isn't there to be friendly to you, she's there to collect a paycheck.\nAnd you don't know what people are going through, it may be that she has a lot going on and finds your meaningless small talk trite and annoying.\nYwbta, and get over yourself.\nEveryone in the world doesn't want to be your friend, and just because they don't gush back doesn't mean they are unfriendly, it means they don't gush back to actual strangers they see regularly (not even acquaintances, this is strictly a retail transaction and has everything to do with habit, not affinity).\nGood goddess, this is one post and I find you trite and annoying, and I don't have to see you weekly.\nWhat's happening in your life that the cashiers cheerful engagement means so much to you? That you would consider complaining to her work that you aren't being coddled and scraped to enough?\nDo you need to get out there and volunteer somewhere to get that meaningful interaction while out and about instead of expecting it from people just trying to pay their bills?\nJust a thought.", "YWBTA you probably were being annoying and if this is your way of saying that you were being treated poorly my guess IMO is that you were the same back then and the people got tired of you being like that so they started to ignore you. Instead of trying to engage conversation constantly with someone who doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you just keep it pushing", "Let the woman do her job. She\u2019s being paid to check out your items not make small talk to pass the time", "If you want to be coddles with a \u201cservice with a smile\u201d, go to self checkout.

She sounds like a real asshole tho.", "Yta leave the poor people working there alone. They aren\u2019t your friends. Just make your purchase shit your mouth and get out of the way so they can help the next idiot in line. Also not everything is about someone being racist.  Stop being a victim", "Jeez, just ignore her and get on with your day. How do people make such big things out of nothings? She ignores you, oh boo-hoo, you're going to report her? Just Jeez.", "YWBTA. This is not the hill to die on.", "YTA. If you mess with a customer service workers livelihood just because they aren't polite enough for you, you are a bad person, it's really that simple.", "Ywbta. They are not required to perform a song and dance for you. They could have any number of things going on in their life that would make it hard to put forth that extra effort. Unless it is actively causing a real problem (not hurt feelings or irritation), please don't tattle. \n\nI know it can be off putting, but I can almost assuredly tell you that it likely has nothing to do with you.", "YTA. \nNot even a ywbta. \nDude it\u2019s not that deep. Shes not greeting you. Big deal. Move on with your day. Do you expect random people who look in your direction to smile and wave as well? \n\nEither call her out and ask what the problem is, or do self checkout and move on.", "That\u2019s really weird and unfortunate. I wonder if she just rude to you and your mother? Is race or something else a factor?\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to feel uncomfortable and attacked when you\u2019re just going grocery shopping.\nI\u2019m not complain to managers or things like that but treating you like garbage simply because you exist and you haven\u2019t done anything to her definitely warrants a complaint to the manager and I hope they intervene.\n\nDefinitely NTA. Sorry she has been treating you badly\n\nEdit \u2014 to everyone who saying that she doesn\u2019t owe kindness to anyone or even friendliness that\u2019s true. But OP says that she is being hostile, that the rude behavior is directed only at them and their family member. \nLike you go to shop someone doesn\u2019t even respond hi to you glares at you and says yeah what do you want, When just seconds before they were smiling and pleasant with another random person. How would you feel? It\u2019s clearly not a constant in their personality it\u2019s targeted towards this person\n\nBut, and this is directed at OP\nDon\u2019t go reporting anyone who\u2019s rude to you, you would definitely be the asshole. Who cares what the customer service manual says. The only reason I backed you up on this is if there is one person consistently being hostile and because you use this word hostile, then you have a right to not be miss treated. If it\u2019s someone just not being friendly or not smiling then who cares, like other people say go to another line or do self check out. I don\u2019t make it your mission to report every person who is not nice to you because you\u2019re not the center of the world. They\u2019re working to pay for their bills and to put food on their table.", "You\u2019re not an A H, but it\u2019s probably just worth going to a different store.

Just because the job is a bit shit doesn\u2019t mean that people need to be assholes.

Then there may be a 'press the green button', and 'remove your card'. Then, 'thank you'. People are preoccupied and focused.
