Kudos to you for sticking up for her.", "All you say to that racist mother is if she\u2019d done her job as a decent parent then you wouldn\u2019t have had to step in.

The mother didn't care either (probably because that's where the daughter got that language from). So calling a child the n word, making fun of her looks, using other slurs, was OK with these people until it was recorded and sent to other parents in the daughter's class so other parents of brown and black children would know what's going on. Social ostracism for totally unacceptable behavior has its place. \n\nThe best scenario would be for the teacher to address this in the class, and tell the child to stop this so the other children would want to play with her again.

You are a hero mom!!!  If the schools refuse to properly take action then what choice did you have? Perfectly executed and carried out in my opinion.  That girl needed to be punished for her attitude and behavior in a way that would get through to her.

You're not enough of one race for either side and so you're left feeling like you belong nowhere. It gets better, sort of. What really happens is as you get older you start finding people who are more interested in who you are then what you look like. But it starts by loving yourself first.  Work on this with her before she goes into her teen years.

Any response less than \"I am appalled that my child has been using that language and will take steps to teach her not to be racist\" is an admission that racist mom is comfortable with the language \n\nRacists hate being held accountable in any way.   They seem to always believe you are the worse person for trying to hold them accountable.   Social shunning is an appropriate response and should continue until the mom changes their tune or i predict this will escalate. \n\nYou're so totally completely not the asshole.", "NTA.

She shouldn't have needed the video evidence, her reactions show she thought it wasn't important, not that she didn't believe it happened.", "The bully's parents and the school were already informed, and they did nothing.", "Yeah that's why you talk it out again with your hard evidence in hand.\n\nWtf is accomplished by sending it out to the other parents?", "Yeah after the school and parent did nothing in the first place. If they had then there would have been no video to begin with", "look, let's say the girl shop lifted instead,  following a parents example... then she gets caught.  hand cuffed,  brought to juvenile hall,  court,  etc.  she's kept in juvy for 2 months where she's abused. \n     this happens to 9 year olds.  & many of us consider racism worse than shop lifting.  being recorded & embarrassed is not that bad of a consequence.  my point is,  very bad behavior has consequences,  even for nine year olds.", "That verbal talking to you mentioned was never coming from home, that was clear. Plus, the school gave her a verbal talking to and that didn\u2019t stop anything. People won\u2019t treat her differently for the next 5 years or even the next 5 months if she honestly and actually changes her inappropriate behavior. I\u2019m also more concerned about the real lasting effects on OPs daughter and any other children who are victims of being racially bullied by this girl than I am about her potential negative repercussions and I believe you should be too.", "Read through my other comments, Ive already answered this", "They brushed off accusations with no evidence. OP got evidence then didn't go back with it.", ">but I also think your tactics were slimy.\n\nNo such thing when dealing with racists\n\n>This could have been a discussion without recordings.\n\nIt was, when she went to the meeting prior.", "They already met and talked and the mother of the bully did nothing.", "They did try to have meetings (prior to the recording), but the brat\u2019s mum brushed it off. She even said it\u2019s an innocent mistake. I would say the kid deserves it.", "That's probably because you \"heard\" it. When pronounced blay-sian it makes perfect sense. If you are only reading it with no frame of reference, it's easy to read it as blass-ian, which is not obvious.", "Good for you, here\u2019s your gold star: \u2b50\ufe0f", "Well obviously it\u2019s not for everybody if someone asked it to be explained.", "Well, I can't speak for anyone else but weirdly my mind didn't go straight towards the ethnicity explanation. Rather, it went for the word \"Blase\" which means indifferent or unbothered.\n\nI initially thought the OP was using a trendy new buzzword to describe her daughter as someone who normally identifies as chill... the point being that the bullying was making her not so chill.\n\nThe human mind strays in odd directions sometimes. lol.", "Absolutely. Force that school to be held accountable. You'll likely make a change at that school, at least for this year, if the school gets in trouble...which they should. Part of the widespread bullying problem are schools that sweep it under the rug. In my experience, many public schools do because all they care about are test scores and attendance, both of which translate into the school's rating and principals' egos.", "Please don't shame people for asking polite questions. That's how we learn.", "I was not sure, never heard of the word before.", "I've never heard of it myself, I had to Google it.", "&#x200B;\n\n>Eh. The bully's mom's apathetic reaction when told previously still justifies it. She shouldn't have needed the video evidence, her reactions show she thought it wasn't important, not that she didn't believe it happened.\n\nThat was not the point of my post, and if I had a friend I would not give them such poor advice that may prove to be more trouble than good in the long run just for some temporary revenge. \n\n>**I would just advise you not to do that again as you will most likely have enemies ( the parents) on your back plotting on ways to ruin you and your family ( reputation and legally).**\n\nHer actions could very well be justified from her pov but not quite strategic. These parents can seek legal and other forms of actions against her. If they are savvy may seek legal action against her ( such as character defamation and harassment)  because she selectively picked black and brown parents to share the media with to depict the child as racist and by extension the parents being racist as well.", "Every heard of try again with actual video evidence? Maybe the other parents didnt understand the severity of what was happening and same with the teachers of the school", "You don\u2019t just try once and then take matters in your own hands. When things escalated, you take it to them again and if that doesn\u2019t work then you figure out a solution. Sharing the video with other parents doesn\u2019t solve anything. And it doesn\u2019t teach the bully or the parent anything long term either.", "The authority here is the school. OP went to them with a her word against the other mom's word situation. Then she got hard evidence, and instead of going back to the school, spread it around to other parents.\n\nThe girl is the one suffering, not the mom, even though it's the mom's fault.", "It sure does but it still seems like OP went from 10 to 100 a little too fast. She could have the intermediate step first and if it did not work then gone her current route.", "Lol it doesn't happen to 9 year old girls.", "> I\u2019m also more concerned about the real lasting effects on OPs daughter and any other children who are victims of being racially bullied by this girl than I am about her potential negative repercussions and I believe you should be too.\n\nI can be worried for both. Obviously OP's daughter is a victim and might need help to deal with any self-esteem issues that might pop up or anything else. The other girl is also a nine year old tho and I doubt any nine year old girl is racist by her own thinking. Most likely she does not even know what being racist is and is copying the slur words that her parents/other family have used in her home. \n\n\n>People won\u2019t treat her differently for the next 5 years or even the next 5 months if she honestly and actually changes her inappropriate behavior.\n\nYou might be surprised by how well people can hold on to their beliefs and biases (especially unconsciously).\n\n>That verbal talking to you mentioned was never coming from home, that was clear. Plus, the school gave her a verbal talking to and that didn\u2019t stop anything\n\nTbh it might have with the video evidence. Plenty of parents might not admit they gave their kid a verbal talking to but they would anywa. Either way it's more important to submit proper evidence of this bullying to the school teachers and principal and for them to take on a more active role.", "Exactly. Sadly, many schools won\u2019t do anything until a parent makes a big enough fit with the superintendent, goes to the media, a child commits suicide or there is a shooting. I\u2019ve been involved in or proximity to the first 3 and it is not a fun time.", "> Maybe the other parents didnt understand the severity of what was happening and same with the teachers of the school\n\nYou trying to tell me they dont know the severity of racism???", "Ever heard of actual parenting? If the bully\u2019s mother did some of that, the. The entire situation wouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be an asshole to other people and then complain that they didn\u2019t handle you with care.", ">Sharing the video with other parents doesn\u2019t solve anything.\n\nI dunno, seems like it did.", "We don't know the whole back story.  OP may have gone to the school multiple times for bullying.  OP may have only told us one chapter to the story.  And by the looks of it, showing the video to other parents did the job.", "\u201cSharing the video doesn\u2019t solve anything\u201d\n\nYes, it does. It exposes the child and her mother for they are and ensures that the others keep their distance from their bigotry.\n\nIt also ensures that the victim will have enough support in the even the bullying escalated further.", "Actually the school is not the authority as the bullying in the latest instance happened via Roblox and not on school grounds or hours. As OP stated in another comment when her daughters pencil pouch was taken by the bully it was outside the school and they wiped their hands of any responsibility.", "It sounds like the school did try and give a verbal warning to the bully atleast. Then this mom shows her this video evidence and the school would likely escalate that verbal warning into something more perhaps a stronger talking down and a detention in which a teacher explains to the bully what she is doing wrong and to stay away from the other girl.", "We're talking about a little girl probably in 3rd grade who's nine likely just regurgitating out what her parents told her in terms of slurs. She likely doesnt even know what racism is in the first place.", "What is solved?", "All the more reason to stomp that behaviour down immediately and brutally.\n\nOr what do you suggest, wait until she escalates it to physical violence?"]}
