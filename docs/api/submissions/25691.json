From the jump, I basically had to do everything short of physically shaking them down in order to get them to help pay their portion of the phone bill.\n\n I went through 3 different instances where our phone lines would get temporarily suspended, mainly due to me not having enough money to cover the entire bill myself, and them not contributing. I finally had enough, told them that I was going to go solo, and for them to fend for themselves; which they agreed to. \n\nI then waited until my billing cycle had reset, and promptly had both their lines disconnected, pretty much with no warning, other than saying something 2 weeks prior, and switched my own line to a single plan, instead of the family one I was under. \n\nWithin an hour of doing so, I was called by the female, using her ex husband\u2019s phone, calling me a \u201cselfish prick\u201d and \u201cshould\u2019ve waited until they could get phones for themselves\u201d before cutting them off. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the Asshole: she is a DoorDash driver, and she can\u2019t do her job without her phone.

It\u2019s their own fault for not taking it seriously until you actually did it.", "NTA. You gave them a warning. 2 weeks is plenty!\n\nHow hard is it to get a phone? I go to Verizon or AT&T or T-Mobile and walk out with a new phone and plan within an hour. If you can't afford a new phone, everyone at least has one friend who has their old phone still lying around somewhere. Hell, they have phones! It's not hard to switch those!\n\nIt's not that deep! Apparently it was no problem to not have a phone when you couldn't pay the bill.\n\nShould you have waited until they got new phones? No. Because that's an indefinite deadline, which you can guarantee will be between forever to eternity before they do. We're talking people who couldn't pay a phone bill for pete's sake. All you're going to hear is more and more excuses.\n\nAs for the boyfriend's calls to his PO officer? That sucks, but he's the one who decided to go to jail. I can't imagine he couldn't possibly go to the police station or courthouse and ask them to reach out to his PO. Or visit his PO in person. Or get a burner phone. Again, how hard is it to get a phone?", "NTA. They never paid you, so why would you give them more time? She can go get a cheap SIM card for her phone, and he can use internet phone services like Google Voice to contact his PO, or he can go visit his PO in person and explain his situation and there are places he can go to use a landline.", "NTA. \n\nThe phrase FAFO comes to mind. They f'ed around with you, and found out what happens.", "NTA - When you stated service would end she could have asked for details but chose not to. She continually lacked the ability to pay on time. She wants to blame someone else instead of herself. Be happy you are free!", "Nta. SHE should have paid her bill. SHE should have paid attention when you warned her.  Not your fault.  Not your responsibility.  Not your problem.", "NTA \nNot your problem, they should have paid their bills.  Your not responsible for them; you took care of it for far too long.", "It isn't that you don't want them to have phones. Its that you can't afford to pay for them to have phones while they don't live up to their commitment. They had 2 years to become trustworthy. How many more years did they want you to wait?\n\nEven if they can't get credit at a major carrier, they can use a pay-as-you-go service. Straight-Talk, for example, has a $30. basic smartphone and varying plans including a $35 card that gives texts, internet, and phone for a month.\n\nNTA", "Nta\n\n>pretty much with no warning, other than saying something 2 weeks prior\n\nYou're contradicting yourself here probably out of misplaced guilt.
