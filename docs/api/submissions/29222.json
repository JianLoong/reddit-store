My brother stayed at his friends house for a bit and me and his gf when back to the hotel. We were both trying to have a nap but she got In bed with me because it was really cold and she was cuddling up to me to keep warm (we didn't have any extra blankets or anything.) \n\nI woke up to my brother screaming at us both and saying how disgusting we are. We did explain to him that nothing happened but he was still really upset and angry.\n\nThey're on the verge of breaking up and I feel really shitty about it. I just wish my brother would understand that I don't like her that way at allll and she doesn't like me like that either she was just cold. I'm worried that I've messed up my relationship with my brother and my friendship with his gf.\n\nI feel like it's kinda dumb though because if I was a girl he wouldn't care? Like just because I'm straight doesn't mean I want to fuck every girl I interact with \n\nMy parents are pissed too and said they're really ashamed of me. Am I the asshole?\n\n\nedit: idk if it changes anything but I have known her before she knew my brother and our relationship has always been touchy in a platonic way though\n\n\nThanks for the comments I haven't replied to them all but thank you still\n\n\nextra edit because there's a lot of confusion: The hotel did have extra blankets but they were the gross scratchy ones and it did have a thermostat I turned it up but I don't know if it was working or not because it was still kinda cold and there was two beds", "created_utc": 1697703680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17be6j1/aita_for_sharing_a_bed_with_my_brothers_girlfriend/", "score": 1694, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All of their responses are valid. They need to learn how to deal with their relationships being challenged. The parents are the real assholes, if anyone. Trust your kids well enough to talk with them before leaping to judgement.", "\"Like just because I'm straight doesn't mean I want to fuck every girl I interact with\"\n\nI guess 18 year olds are very different compared to when I was that age....", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. \n\nI agree with you re: it wouldn\u2019t be a problem jf you were a girl. I think people are really, really ridiculous when it comes to platonic intimacy \u2014 *not* sexual or romantic intimacy, I mean emotional and/or physically close moments, which are *not* inherently romantic or sexual. It shows weakness in the level of trust between not just individuals and their partners, but peoples (and lets be real, usually straight peoples) entire worldview of romantic relationships. \n\nBasically, it is strangely possessive in an objectifying way, to me, to suggest your partner cannot touch another person. I appreciate that might seem judgemental of others, but I don\u2019t blame individuals here as much as I blame the society that encourages this possessiveness and lack of trust. \n\nSo, in that sense, I see your parent\u2019s chiming in with that message as quite ass-hole-y, but not enough to say they *are* assholes. \n\n*Disappointingly*, though, not only are they encouraging another generation/their kids to act jealously/possessively/distrustingly and to objectify, they\u2019re encouraging another of my personal pet peeve problem of people (again, lets be real, often straight people) *blaming the third party in acts of cheating/other allegedly inappropriate behaviour*.\n\nJust as it is cringe for people to blame the third party rather than the person who is *actually cheating on their partner*, it is cringe to blame you here more than the gf. If either of you should be accosted, it should moreso be the gf, because she is the one who should be aware of the boundaries in her relationship. \n\nSo in that vein, I would stand firm for yourself, that you simply did not realise that this would be a boundary. Apologise that the boundary was crossed just for the sake of healing relationships, but stay strong in your own view, that it isn\u2019t unacceptable behaviour. Be sure to say that you wouldn\u2019t mind your gf doing the same with your brother, *of course, only if that is true*. If you wouldn\u2019t be okay with it, add that to your apology, and that in retrospect you realise you would be upset, too. \n\nEither way, it is worth empathising with their feelings, even if you and I simply don\u2019t get it lol. \n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nPeople need to calm down", "YTA", "In what WORLD would you want to come back to the hotel room and find him with your gf!!?

I never had a situation like yours, but from my experiences i can see why you might not have seen the situation as anything more than the facts. One thing i learned in my experiences is that sometimes people will hide under the platonic side of an interaction and secretly have more romantic intentions that they dont want to admit to. So while you feel like there was nothing going on because you didnt take it as anything romantic, that might not be completely true for the other person and if it is its not unfair for people to be concerned that your friendship is teetering on a romantic boundary. \nIn this situation i would apologise to your brother and learn/make some boundaries around platonic interactions as an adult because it is very different to the boundaries as a child.", "I\u2019m going with NAH  because of ages and relationship history and such.

Instead she chose to share a bed and cuddle. Maybe she felt neglected by your brother and felt safe with you. You definitely seem to have more emotional awareness than your brother and parents. Explaining intent is going to get you nowhere - if you want to keep the peace I would apologize and hopefully everyone will move on.\n\nEdit after reading comments: I live in the upper Midwest and just want to say that I\u2019ve gotten into a cold bed at home and in a hotel before. And it\u2019s taken me 30 minutes just to warm up to the point where I can fall asleep. No matter how many blankets you have, the bed is cold even if the thermostat is set to like 72 or something. If you don\u2019t have a lot of body fat and you\u2019re female, being cold is a way of life. The fact that they remained clothed is important. \n\nHonestly, I think your brother is kind of the AH here for how he\u2019s reacting.

Bottom line you were played, either knowingly or unknowingly, I\u2019m a year older then you and I\u2019d def known something was up but maybe the fact you two are friends made it more sensible, explain to your brother that you don\u2019t feel attracted to her, even say it to him in front of her  and tell him about the jacket, your brother is more important then your friend", "YTA for not shagging her .
