You grew up doing this stuff, she didn't. It was her arrogance (and there's no other way of describing it) in thinking 'I'm on the same level as you, if you can do it I can too' that caused her injury and there's no way anyone can cite you as responsible for that.

Didn't realize it and rolled my ankle spraining it.  Didn't hurt because my leg was numb, and I only realized there was a problem when I couldn't get my boot on the next morning.  Over the years I kept re-spraining it until about 20 years ago when I finally obliterated two of the three ligaments holding the outside of my right ankle together and had to have surgery to reconstruct them.  I haven't had an issue since, but I'm permanently banned from wearing high heels as a result.\n\nHopefully her doctor has made her aware that she is now more prone to spraining that ankle again.", ">My MIL and SIL have been blaming me for her hurting herself because somehow it\u2019s my fault she decided to come after me and also it\u2019s my fault that I didn\u2019t wait for her??
