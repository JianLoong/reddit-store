I\u2019m far from my fittest these days but I still remember how to do these things.\n\nBasically during the hike there was a small path off the trail which led down into a valley with a little lake. In the lake was an island with a tree in it. \n\nI thought it looked pretty so I told my husband to tell everyone to continue without me and I would catch up after I went down to have a look.\n\nUnbeknownst to me my SIL decided that if I (being overweight) could do it then so could she. Well she tried to follow the path I had taken, got her foot stuck between two rocks and ended up twisting it.\n\nI heard her yelling and had to climb back up and husband ended up making a makeshift cold compress from the ice packs we had in our cooler bag.\n\nMy MIL and SIL have been blaming me for her hurting herself because somehow it\u2019s my fault she decided to come after me and also it\u2019s my fault that I didn\u2019t wait for her??

Both are healed as confirmed by a Dr. All I meant by the phrase \u201cbad accident\u201d was that it is a bad thing to happen and it was an accident - this isn\u2019t in any way related to the severity of her injury which is what people seem to think it is)\n\nAm I really TA?", "created_utc": 1674391873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iizdw/aita_because_my_sil_got_injured/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You even turned around when you realised she was hurt and you also performed first aid.

I would ignore them or you might catch some of their stupidity.", "NTA - she chose to follow you", "NTA. You did your thing. She chose to follow and that\u2019s on her. You don\u2019t owe her an explanation that you used to do this stuff. She just thought if you can do it so can she, and was wrong.", "NTA \n\nShe made the decision to follow you and injured herself", "NTA - She got herself into that pickle. I\u2019m pretty sure, if she would have asked you either you would have advised her against it or helped her getting down that path. They are the AHs for accusing you, unless you knew SIL was following you.", "NTA. She failed to tell you that she wanted to go with you. You're not a mind reader; so none of the alternative scenarios being painted by MIL and SIL are viable.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make her do anything.", "NTA - your instruction was \"y'all go on without me\"\n\nSIL disobeyed that instruction and therefore only has herself to blame. You grew up doing this stuff, she didn't. It was her arrogance (and there's no other way of describing it) in thinking 'I'm on the same level as you, if you can do it I can too' that caused her injury and there's no way anyone can cite you as responsible for that. If she'd seen you start juggling flaming batons would it have been fine for her to just have a go without practice? Of course not.", "NTA\n\nIf you decide to do drugs and you need to go to the hospital, that's entirely on you and you are the one accountable for doing drugs.

They are cuckoo if they think its your fault that she followed you without you knowing -__-", "NTA. Is SIL the golden child? This reaction is ridiculous.", "Your SIL experienced self inflicted Karma.
