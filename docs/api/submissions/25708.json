At the time we didn't have any really great fits but their were definitely better fits then the one they chose. \nThey looked around for awhile, I suggested our most friendliest that had potential to be lap cats, they didn't like those options. Instead they chose one of the scaredest cats in the room. Her name was poptart, right from the start they didn't ask anyone to help them, they just opened the cage and grabbed the cat. It got loose, scratched the woman and ran, as scared cats do. We had to get a staff member to catch the cat. After we put it back the woman scoffed and said, \"well can we still get to meet her in a room\" I went to talk to the staff bc I thought it was a bad idea but they said it was fine so I had to get poptart out and bring her to the room (her cage was the furthest from the room so it was a struggle) the woman sat in the room for awhile with poptart and decided she was the one. Poptart had sat in the corner curled up like the entire time so idk how u go from wanting a lap cat to her but ok? When they came out and said it's the one they wanted I was honest and told them, \"she is not a lap cat if you want a lap cat poptart is not a good fit for you.\" (I will admit i did say this in an aggressive tone as i was getting impatient with them bc they were being rude and this was clearly not a cat for them) They scoffed again and said \"she's fine, well take her\" \n\nSo AITA for telling them she wasn't a good fit?\n\nSurprise surprise poptart came back 2 weeks later.", "created_utc": 1693218855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163iiuj/aita_for_telling_potential_adopters_that_a_cat_is/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were sharing your professional opinion, and you were right.", "This is very strange - I am surprised they were allowed to adopt her. When we went to the shelter, they had a corridor of room-sized cages and as you went down the line, you went from most tame to most feral. The ones at the end of the corridor, they said should only be adopted by someone with land so they could be outdoor barn cats - they would never be comfortable in a home. They came out to our house to check it would be suitable before we finalised the adoption (our cat is a bit wild - she was used to living in a house but had been neglected. She was under a year when we got her but had already had a litter of kittens). NTA - they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to take that cat and unsettle her", "NTA", "NTA and poptart is an amazing name for a cat.", "NTA. Lots of people get pets that won\u2019t be a good fit for their home and then they end up dumping them back at a shelter or worse, you were just trying to prevent that.", "NTA. I think more shelters/pet stores etc need to speak up more for the animals. It's not fair the animal gets thrown into a home that will not be suitable for them, just because someone comes in and picks them. \n\nWhere we adopted out cat from, we had to submit an application and explain what sort of cat we were after, what our home life was like etc and they made sure it would suit the cat we picked.

But I don't agree with it unsupervised, even in town hawks and eagles and crows can snatch your animals.
