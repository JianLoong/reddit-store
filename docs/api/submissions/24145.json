My mother in law is the main offender, she dosent respect boundaries and refuses to listen to me for example my child has multiple skull fractures and can not be picked up, but in her usual fashion she asked to pick him up and the nurse in clear astonishment and my own mothers too, told her under no circumstances will anybody be picking him up while he is in critical condition, then today i find out in the private group chat that my husband family has that she thinks I\u2019m \u201cimmature\u201d and a \u201cbad mom\u201d and how I was the reason the accident happened so she wants to fight me for custody of my child. \n\nSo after having warned her multiple times to respect me and my boundaries i decided that I\u2019m cutting her off, and out of my child life because my baby desperately needs positivity and space to heal, I originally decided that I wasn\u2019t going to fight with her to try and keep things civil but she repetitively pushed me. \n\nBoth my aunt in law and my husband\u2019s friends think that I\u2019m pushing her back and retaliating because I\u2019m having a hard time, so AITA?\n\n\nEdit to add: I was not in the car during the accident I was working my usual 10 hour shift almost a full hour away from where we lived", "created_utc": 1691466787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l6r2c/aita_for_banning_my_in_laws_from_the_picu_after/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This truly sounds like a nightmare and I\u2019m sorry that she\u2019s piling on instead of being supportive.", "NTA get her off your child's visitor list. She wants to do something that she was told is unsafe and she probably will if she has half a chance. What is she going to go to court and tell them your the reason the accident happened to get custody when you were an hour away. She will be laughed out of court. Please get her and her cult brainwashing away from your child so he can heal properly.", "NTA. Jws notoriously over step boundaries and are brainwashed members of a cult. I would try your hardest to keep your baby away from them.", "How tf can she possibly blame you for this when you weren't even there? It's literally the fault of someone was inebriated while driving. And asking to pick your son up when he's so fragile is just...no. Good on you for setting boundaries, now you just gotta stick to them. Have you talked to your husband about it? I'd try to get him on the same page. NTA obviously.", "Nta\n\nMake sure that you get that in writing through the courts that she actively tried to endanger your child. Your mother and nurse were both witnesses to her trying to manhandle a child that shouldn't be touched.", "NTA\nJW is a cult. Keep them FAR AWAY from your family.", "Nta.  She endangered your child by refusing to listen.  She doesn't need to be around the baby at this point.", "NTA. Anybody who would threaten to take my child from me is not going to be in the child\u2019s life, I mean that\u2019s the biggest offense I can think of.  There is nothing worse that a person could possibly threaten you with, so what would you do other than cut them off? Anyone saying you\u2019re trying to retaliate has their head on backwards because you just want to protect your child, like a normal person.  That\u2019s not retaliation.  That is removing a serious risk to your family and your sanity.", "NTA! I was reading along assuming MIL was like praying loudly over the baby or something like that and then my jaw dropped: \n\n>she thinks I\u2019m \u201cimmature\u201d and a \u201cbad mom\u201d and how I was the reason the accident happened so she wants to fight me for custody of my child.\n\nDefinitely don't let her anywhere near your injured child. The hospital should have a system either for banning specific people, or only allowing specific people in. But also, why just banning her from the PICU? If a relative made noises about fighting me for custody of my own child, I'd be banning them from my life.", "NTA. MIL was actively ignoring not only your boundary, but orders given by medical professionals and as a result endangering your child's recovery. I'd draw up paperwork declaring \"Why my son and daughter-in-law don't talk to me anymore\" and have it framed. It would be a lovely christmas gift for them.", "NTA. She threatened/ is thinking about taking your child away from you. Right then and there, she should lose access to your child forever. \n\n\nAll the stuff I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve put up with already would have been my breaking point.", "Obviously NTA. Your MIL honestly seems deranged, immediately pushing the blame of the accident on you instead of...you know...showing compassion and empathy in a stressful and dire time?  \n\n\nYou make a good call cutting her off.", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right in cutting her off. She is not a rational person (blaming you for the actions of a drunk driver), is a danger to your child's recovery and is now threatening to take your child.\n\nI am so sorry you are dealing with this on top of all your stress but that woman should be nowhere near your child, I would not be surprised if abducted your child because she thinks she knows best. Inform the hospital administration immediately rthat she is not allowed entry to your child's room and ignore those people around you who are making you doubt yourself.", "I am sorry this happened and I hope for the best for your baby,  husband, and you. NTA. Their belief systems are in complete conflict with medical science. It\u2019s a medieval sensibility.  \n\nThey\u2019re dangerous, lethally  in these situations. You have no choice but to shut them out completely to protect your family.", "\nNTA. At. All. \nDo whatever you need to legally to keep her away.", "NTA make sure to get the name of the nurse who saw your MIL try to pick up the baby. \n\nKeep that woman far away. \n\nAlso I\u2019m so sorry this happened to your family I hope they both recover fully and fast.", "You are absolutely NTA. It\u2019s your family first and foremost and what is best for your children in the eyes of medicine and your personal belief system are what matters. If in laws can\u2019t comply with your wishes, they have no reason to be involved with your family in this vulnerable time. Wishing your husband and your child the best.", "NTA- speak to hospital administration about banning your MIL and also make them aware she was looking to do something medically prohibited. She has no grounds to get custody.", "NTA the second she threatened to try for custody that person would be dead to me. But you're gonna need your husband's support on this. It's not a feasible thing to do unless you're both 100% on board.", "NTA. You do whatever you need to do to keep your child from further harm. Keep them away.", "Absolutely NTA. *HUGS* I am so sorry your family was hurt! *More Hugs!*", "NTA it\u2019s the right thing to not subject a child to such a person. It\u2019s good for you to get that distance too.", "NTA. Anyone wanting to hold your critically injured child, threatening to fight you for custody of your child and blames you for an accident you had no part of needs a restraining order.", "NTA. You are the 3rd victim of this car accident. YOU need support right now. I applaud you for demanding respect when you must be hurting so terribly. Hugs OP.", "NTA.
