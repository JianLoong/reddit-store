He\u2019s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I\u2019ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.\n\nIt was my younger siblings\u2019 (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent\u2019s house to celebrate.\n\nOn Friday, Harry told me he wasn\u2019t feeling up to a children\u2019s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.\n\nSo I decided I\u2019d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.\n\nWhen I told Harry as much, he didn\u2019t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.\n\nSaturday came and I drove over to my parent\u2019s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn\u2019t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though. \n\nThe party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.\n\nHowever, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should\u2019ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable.\nHe has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I thought he\u2019d have calmed down by now but he\u2019s still sulking and I\u2019m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I\u2019m the AH here.", "created_utc": 1685620532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xflcv/aita_for_leaving_my_sick_husband_at_home/", "score": 3104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he was having some sort of life threatening issues you should have stayed home.  Staying home would have meant what, you sit there and watch him cry like the baby he is?   He needs to grow up.

You didn't go on a special vacation, you weren't going to meet his idol, you weren't out partying, you went to a child relatives birthday party for a couple hours. If he is still pouting and giving you the silent treatment days later, he may need a psychiatrist. Honestly, I'd start giving him the same treatment for being so darn ungrateful and acting less mature than your 9yr old relative. You went out of your way to ensure you helped care for his incapable self, while working I might remind you, and before leaving his bedside made sure he was set up with all he could need for a couple hours. He sounds like an ungrateful, spoiled brat, husband or not he needs put in his place. He should be thanking you for all you did, and leaving him what he needed, with the ability to call you if he needed (which he didn't do, so that indicates nothing went awry that he couldn't handle).

I'm sure your husband feels awful, but your presence at all times won't help him feel much better, tbh.

You've worked from give because of the flu and he thinks you suit so more? It's the flu.  It's uncomfortable sure,  but there's nothing anyone can do except to get through it.

That's totally unreasonable.", "Hold it. You went to a kids party knowing your husband was ill. Didn't it occur to you that you might be carrying the virus and pass it to the other guests?

If it was him that was well and you were sick, and he had the opportunity to go out for just a few hours to get some fresh air he would. And if he said he wouldn't he's lying. You did nothing wrong. He is mad because he couldn't go because he is sick and he didn't want you to have fun without him. Tell him that you and him can go out and do something together when he feels better.

He was envious that you weren\u2019t as miserable as him. He wanted you to feel bad when he feels bad. What a selfish behavior! It\u2019s okay to feel jealous when someone can do something you can\u2019t but we learn in kindergarten that emotions are okay to have but when they are unfair we need to get a grip and not let them hurt others. Apparently he missed this crucial life lesson. \n\nHe didn\u2019t need a caretaker, he couldn\u2019t stand you feeling better than him.

That\u2019s not okay. If he gives you the silent treatment and is generally rude to you I hope you stopped going out if your way to help him.
