I was born as a naturally empathetic and caring person. This was taken advantage of so many times to my detriment from childhood on, although I didn't start to resent it and then get really angry until a few years ago.   \n\n\nI was the child who was constantly sat by the disruptive child or bully who made everyone's life miserable, because I would be kind to them, and, it was futilely hoped, possibly \"influence\" them. However the kindness was never returned to me as I simply became the target of that child's nonstop hassling or bullying. I was already struggling in school due to undiagnosed learning disabilities, and struggling with friendships due to being quiet and shy. Being ALWAYS sat by troublemaking kids made this a million times worse, but I strove to be kind.   \n\n\nIn middle school and high school I would stay up until all hours of the night trying to help friends or even acquaintances wanting someone to listen to their severe mental health struggles. I did my best but was in no way qualified, but I was guilt tripped by multiple people into \"supporting\" them all hours of the night, or else they claimed they would take drastic actions. They never seemed to consider the impact on me for even a moment, but I still strove to be kind.   \n\n\nAs I got older I was the friend who always got calls when people wanted to recount their struggles for hours and hours and hours - dating, work, friendships, every minute thing they wanted to complain about. I never asked for anything in return because I have always been pretty self-sufficient. 99% of these \"conversations\" were monologues I just listened to. But I did eventually get into an extremely bad/extremely dangerous situation that I needed help with. EVERY SINGLE ONE of my \"Friends\" at that time ghosted/blocked me!!!!!!!!! ONLY strangers and distant acquaintances helped me, and those kind strangers did help a lot.   \n\n\nAfter I recovered, I began to be filled with anger at what had happened. I decided never again would I provide that level of constant emotional support except to any future kids I might have. I would only date people who were like me, usually self-sufficient. Of course I'd support them in an emergency.  \n\n\nStill I find that people who want 1-sided emotional support are really drawn to me. I've had new friends invite me out to something that sounded fun, only to literally corner me in a corner and trauma dump all their problems on me so I don't even get to do the thing I was invited for. That makes me really irritated.  \n\n\nSo I was on a first date and this guy steers the conversation into trauma dumping all his problems onto me. I immediately knew this would not work for me so I mentally checked out. When he was done I sincerely said \"good luck with all of that.\" I was sincere, not sarcastic. But I was ready to go and not willing to provide emotional support. According to him I am a MAJOR asshole.", "created_utc": 1679364508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x3qqa/aita_for_telling_a_guy_good_luck_instead_of_being/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're disillusioned and while I don't blame you (I'm in the same exact boat) I know it's not a great place to be.

I mean, most you can make of it is the person laying their weaknesses on the table firsthand so the other can decide whether they want to have a relationship with the baggage of that person, or something. Expecting anything more than an acceptance or rejection at that point is just weird.", "The ironic thing is that nearly all the disruptive/troublemaking kids/bullies I was sat next to daily, expected to \"influence,\" and targeted by nonstop, for my entire childhood, were all boys, with only a few notable exceptions. When I really started to get angry about this, my anger really begins there. They damaged my ability to do well in school both academically and socially in a way that has severely impacted my entire life. Even more so I am angry at the teachers for using me this way. And I've recently found out it's STILL a practice that teachers commonly do, use quiet/kind kids to \"buffer\" troublemaking kids this way. That makes me so angry I can actually feel my blood pressure rise when I think about it.", "I find it very strange too. I still get people I don't know very well trying to use me for 1-sided emotional support CONSTANTLY!!! Obviously something about me is attracting them to me because I don't think everyone has this issue. But I don't know why, because it's been several years now that I've strongly resented this behavior and refused to go along with it. So I don't THINK I'm coming off as being somehow open to it.", "That's literally the last thing I would ever want to do haha, I am so over listening to people's problems 1-sidedly, I would actually rather be homeless and eat from a dumpster daily than be a therapist because of how much I resent people dumping their problems on me at this point.", "It isn\u2019t a good idea actually. Emotional vampires don\u2019t want solutions, they want victims. A therapist should help, not prolong the issues. And these people get super-mad when their victims don\u2019t put out the sweet, sweet emotional support they crave constantly. OP would be losing clients left and right if they did what a therapist was supposed to do - ask those people to get their act together.", "It's absolutely NOT fair that you were forced into this, and even if you weren't, you don't owe a strange man anything. \nI'm really sorry that all of this emotional burden weighs on you- but please don't ever question your judgement about this instance. You did the right thing. Dodged a bullet, too. Rejecting someone so abruptly is challenging, but you stuck to your boundaries, and I'm proud of you for that.\n\nAnd FWIW- if you didn't have the history you have with being an emotional push pin for men, you still would have responded correctly.", "So strange. If teachers- i.e., adults who have been given authority by the school system and by a troublesome kid's parents to discipline the kid in question- have difficulty with controlling a troublesome kid, then what the eff makes them think that another kid is going to be able to do it?", "It\u2019s not strange at all - emotional vampires have a sixth sense for people like you and start on their tirade straight away. And the get MAD when their victim fights back.\n\nUnfortunately you are who you are and they feel it, nothing much to be done about it unless you start being rude to everyone from the start. I think it has to do with body language but I have no idea how or what. Just to be clear, I am the opposite of you but I still get irritated seeing it happen to kind people. So rude. And don\u2019t get me started on everyone having traumas\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t back down.", "Darn. But yeah think of it this way, if they dump their problems on you during a date or an outing - send them a bill for therapy.   \nMan, I am the AH for suggesting this.", "You are an asshole I'm not sure why you think all of your backstory matters. His perspective matters and to him you are an asshole. You said you mentally checked out you used all of your previous issues and decided this person wasn't worth your time or effort.  \n\n\nThat's ok but, your an asshole just because your previous history justifies you being cold to another person doesn't mean you weren't still an asshole.", "Man is trauma dumping on a first date to someone who he\u2019s known for hardly any time at all. Sure he\u2019s going through some shit, but this is not good first date behaviour and she isn\u2019t his therapist. Dates are like job interviews for both parties, the point is to identify deal breakers on both sides and decide how to proceed from there. She shut it down and wished him well without being insulting or airing his dirty laundry online. Why do you think she owes him advice and emotional support? Wouldn\u2019t that be harder on him in the long run if she had given it and had no intention of following it up, rather than setting boundaries immediately? Why does his backstory matter and hers doesn\u2019t?", ">I'm not sure why you think all of your backstory matters.\n\nYea just like I wasn't sure why his backstory mattered lol.\n\nEither both our backstories matter or both of them do not.\n\nBut I'm no longer accepting situations where my backstory and perspective don't matter at all and I'm expected to sit there, listen and care to another person's backstory and perspective. I just refuse to do that anymore.", ">Why does his backstory matter and hers doesn\u2019t?\n\nI'm tempted to say \"because of the pronouns involved,\" but I've still been severely targeted for this behavior by fellow females who are platonic. Still I feel like, even if a man is not a general emotional vampire most of the time, when he does \"need\" emotional support, he usually identifies a woman (female friend if he has nobody else) who should give it to him. The same man would never think to provide emotional support to anyone in return, especially, GOD FORBID, a fellow man. This is a scenario I've been in often with men who are \"not usually emotional.\""]}
