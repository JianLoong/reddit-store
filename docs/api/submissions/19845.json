She needs to dump your ass because she can do so much better", "Omg you absolutely suck. \n\n\nYTA. \n\nSo, in other words, you didn't actually buy her a gift at all then? Why not just admit it instead? You ordered it for yourself, pretended you got it for her and then just TOOK it from her, killing the joy she had when she thought you gifted it to her. Wow you're incredibly shitty. Oh so very shitty. \n\n\nThat's absolutely not how \"gifts\" work btw. I'm unsure if you knew that, but once you give someone a gift.... It's theirs. Cause you GAVE it to them. You don't take it from them and you certainly don't say that you can \"cause you paid for it.\" \n\nWhat you did was just mean and kinda fucked up man. Talk about sucking the fun out of it for her. Shittiest \"gift\" ever.", "YTA\n\nYou bought it as a gift for her.

Probably wouldn\u2019t happen because you\u2019d gaslight her into not doing it anymore", "YTA- you ruined the experience for her. So what that you bought it. It became HERS when you gifted it.

Seriously grow up. \n\nAbsolutely TA, and doubly so because you came here to post asking if *\"playing a game I bought for her, and ruining something she was excited about\"* would require a third person perspective on if you are even an AH, because seriously no thought required, yes, you are.", "YTA. Please tell me you aren\u2019t that delusional. \nYou took her gift from her. You bought it for HER and stole her enjoyment. \nThe truth is though, you bought it for you.  \nYour buying the game isn\u2019t your trump card.

My ex did this to me with one of the Pokemon games. As a result, I STILL haven't completed the game, as he completely ruined it for me.", "YTA. \n\nAs soon as you gave it to her, it was hers.

He didn't play the game until I had the chance to play it myself. (I also bought him a copy when it released)\n\nI was about 1/4 of the way through when he started playing. But he also made sure to never progress the game past where I was at. He made sure I never saw any spoilers to random side content I had not found yet. He did that because he knew how important it was to me that I get to experience the game TOGETHER with him, but with me playing. \n\nThis is the one game series that I do this with. He respected that I wanted to experience it while he watched (watching does not spoil the game for him the same way it does for me). I love the fact that we can discuss what we are seeing on the screen as it happens.\n\nI will also reciprocate and watch him play games for the first time. It's a give and take so that each of us gets to have the experience of getting to play something first.\n\nYou couldn't do this one damn thing for your girlfriend. Something that was obviously important to her. Also, did no one ever teach you about not taking back gifts you gave? That's the quickest way to damage relationships.

Sadly it was under the guise that you wanted it and planned to play it like it was your own.", "Yea YTA - you don\u2019t get to double dip on the gratuity that comes with buying the gift and using it yourself.\n\nAlso are you playing it when she\u2019s home and could potentially play it..?

If I buy dinner for my partner and I, it\u2019s okay if I eat half of their meal when they get stuck in traffic? I paid for it. Not my fault someone ahead of them on the highway got in an accident, after all. \n\nDo you see how dumb that sounds? \n\nOf COURSE YTA. That was her game. You bought it *for her* and ruined the magic of seeing these things herself and discovering them on her own. You didn\u2019t buy it for you.", "My ex husband always did this.  I never got to enjoy the thrill of exploring a game cause he'd already done it all.  Ruined so many games for me I eventually stopped playing them all, and by the time he actually understood why I wasn't playing anymore it was too late.  I never went back to gaming.", "yes", "YTA\n\nDude. I can't even really form into words how angry I would be if you ruined a game for me like this. Are you playing it in front of her? Are you talking about it???? When any new assassin's creed is released my man and I take turns playing when the other is out, and everything is frakin HUSH HUSH.\n\n\nAnd the whole *buying a gift* and then holding it over her head reminds me of my narcissistic ex. So maybe look that up and see if you have any other personality traits?\n\nJust need to call you an AH one more time for ruining the game for her. AH.", "Giant YTA. You bought it \"for her\" then played it yourself.  There shouldn't have been any arguments over who would play it, she should have been playing it whenever she wanted.

When breath of the wild came out on the WiiU, my GF and I and her brother(mike)all sat down while I played after work (8 hour shifts). We were all very into it and it was a great experience! I got all the way to the final boss fight (stage one Gannon) and had a hard time and had to put it down for the night as I had work in the morning, I very excitedly finished work and raced home only to walk through the door at the exact second mike landed the finishing blow on Gannon and ending the game. I haven\u2019t played Botw since, technically haven\u2019t beaten it, and have little interest in TotK because of this incident.

Like, if the Switch is shared, what happens if he's playing Metroid or something instead?

It\u2019s him who set it up as a gift and ruined it, attaching all this baggage.", "That's not been my experience, but this is mostly coming from my youth with my brothers, where gifted games were never someone's sole property.
