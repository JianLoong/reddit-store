{"id": 8866, "submission_id": "10quifi", "title": "AITA For not accepting my friend\u2019s apology for casually saying I should get circumcised?", "selftext": "(Little bit of context: we\u2019ve been friends for years, but there was a period where we were sleeping together, which is how she knows I\u2019m uncircumcised. Since then we\u2019ve just been really good friends and have had other relationships.)\n\nSo me (M24) and my friend (F26) went on holiday with some other friends recently. During the trip we were talking privately and suddenly she says \u201cyou should get circumcised\u201d. Just like that. No preface, no reason.\n\nI was a little taken aback and said \u201cNo? Why did you say it like I have no choice? There are so many other ways you could\u2019ve said that\u201d. She immediately goes on the defence and says that she was going to follow it up with saying how her friend got it done and it worked for him or something, to which I responded something like \u201cOkay, it worked for him. Doesn\u2019t mean you should just suggest anyone with a penis gets surgery, it\u2019s a little deeper than that. I wouldn\u2019t go around suggesting people get cosmetic surgery based on one positive anecdote.\u201d \n\nShe tried to apologise and say that it just slipped out and she misspoke, but part of me wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. I said I needed more than an excuse for why she said it and she got really upset, to the point where she insisted I sleep on the couch (we were sharing a bed during the holiday). In my mind, what she said suggested a lack of care for my own autonomy - whether it was meant that way or not. It implied she doesn\u2019t care enough about how it could come across to monitor what I think is quite an intense thing to say.\n\nI guess I wanted her to actually realise what it meant and what saying out loud with such comfort suggests about her views on my bodily autonomy. Again - it being said by mistake is only part of the story. It wasn\u2019t phrased as a suggestion or an option, it was phrased as an instruction. \n\nPersonally, I think being able to say it at all revealed an inherent lack of respect for my body and the choices I make, which is what I needed to hear from her instead of superficial excuses. It isn\u2019t possible that you can say anything by mistake, so apologising in that way meant very little. \n\nSo AITA here? She was really upset that I couldn\u2019t accept her apology, and didn\u2019t seem to realise what I was asking for. I think she\u2019s really intelligent, so it was painful to not hear what I would\u2019ve assumed she could understand and communicate after making a mistake like that.", "created_utc": 1675257488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10quifi/aita_for_not_accepting_my_friends_apology_for/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have no idea why she should even have an opinion on this, much less say it out loud. Hell, even 2000-something years ago there were letters in the Bible about not telling grown men to get circumcised.

And yes, those statements do have \"varying levels of appeopriateness\". But, let's face it, there's not a polite way to suggest that last example. You can exchange the word \"should\" in that sentence with something far softer, and it would still be a hugely inappropriate thing to say. The problem isn't really with the \"should\" in that sentence, as \"might consider\" would be equally offensive.", "I'm not comparing those two things. I'm comparing the use of should.

Calling it a false equivalency is a straw man that ignores the real point.", "If someone told me to get a boob job or abortion I'd say \"I'm not looking for opinions, thanks.\" And go on with my day. You're not required to be friends with her any longer. So maybe just stop being friends with her.

Yes. Did she apologize once you gave her analogy she could understand? Yes. I get it, we're all defensive about our penises, but how is she attacking your body autonomy? Did she try and hold you down and bite it off herself? Body autonomy is the right to make decisions about your body without coercion or violence. Not the right to have every single person agree with every decision you make about your body.", "WTF? That\u2019s (a) none of her business, (b) utterly inappropriate, (c) none of her business, (d) wtf again, (e) none of her fucking business and (f) should only happen if you have a medical need for it, which would be\u2026 none of her business.", "NTA\n\nA lot of the health benefits are a myth, lots of places/countries do not recommend it unless there is a genuine medical need (which can rarely happen in adult hood).", "NTA, but are you SURE she fully understands what circumcision entails? For context, my husband said he wanted our son circumcised when he was born, so he is. I assumed that as a man who already had a grown son from a previous marriage, my husband knew about these things, and I was quite young. Now, years later, after reading about it myself, I deeply regret that decision. If I had been fully aware of the facts, I would have never allowed it. So I just wonder if, like me, she does not fully comprehend what she even suggested to you and therefore doesn't comprehend the emotional response you've (rightly!) had. I don't think you're at all wrong, but I do wonder if it's an opportunity to suggest she learn about it more before speaking about it. It's not your responsibility to teach her, but it might save her future son from that circumcision if she knew more. I wish someone had told me when I was younger.", "Nta.

Like this is equivalent to telling her she should get a boob job or labia reduction. She would not take kindly to that. She has no place making random comments about your body unless you have explicitly asked for an opinion on the matter.", "So...my 88 year old FIL was not circumcised. Apparently as you age and your skin gets thinner, so does the foreskin. Anyway, it tightened as it shrank and basically rubbed the skin off the head. He and MIL were rubbing lotion and salve on it to \"fix\" it, but he was in constant pain. Finally they went to the Dr. who said this was very common and circumcised him at 88 to fix it. So there's that to consider.", "Obvious bait is obvious.", "NTA for your reaction but YTA for not accepting an apology from a friend. Unless you think it was not a sincere apology.

Thanks.", "I didn\u2019t say she violated my autonomy, I said she doesn\u2019t seem to respect it.", "There is one, (but it's rare and completely unnecessary for her to comment on) and it's adult onset diabetes complications.

Better for you to get the full pleasure out of sex rather than your cock be mutilated", ">There isn\u2019t an issue circumcision would fix\n\nThis is wrong, Phimosis is a condition where you can't pull back the foreskin. It usually can be fixed without a complete circumcision but in some cases it is necessary. But this is like the 0.1% of 1% of people.\n\nStill doesn't change the fact that your friend is the AH and you are completely in your right to not accept it since it was incredibly insensitive.", "Eh its not actually painful. At least my one wasn't. It might have stung when I got morning wood but should be completely fine for 99% of people.\n\nETA: Still doesn't change the fact that she was insensitive and rude.\n\nETA2: This is my own experience and it could vary because I just remembered there are different procedures for it and healthcare/meds given would be different between countries.", "That isn't the only reason, though it's definitely valid. Circumcision is also a treatment for phimosis, and given how awful a severe case should be it's a bit ridiculous for OP to say he opposes circumcision even when medically appropriate.\n\nI'm in favour of not cutting off parts of people's bodies for no reason, and OP is right to be irritated by someone casually suggesting he needs cosmetic surgery.
