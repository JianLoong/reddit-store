{"id": 8866, "submission_id": "10quifi", "title": "AITA For not accepting my friend\u2019s apology for casually saying I should get circumcised?", "selftext": "(Little bit of context: we\u2019ve been friends for years, but there was a period where we were sleeping together, which is how she knows I\u2019m uncircumcised. Since then we\u2019ve just been really good friends and have had other relationships.)\n\nSo me (M24) and my friend (F26) went on holiday with some other friends recently. During the trip we were talking privately and suddenly she says \u201cyou should get circumcised\u201d. Just like that. No preface, no reason.\n\nI was a little taken aback and said \u201cNo? Why did you say it like I have no choice? There are so many other ways you could\u2019ve said that\u201d. She immediately goes on the defence and says that she was going to follow it up with saying how her friend got it done and it worked for him or something, to which I responded something like \u201cOkay, it worked for him. Doesn\u2019t mean you should just suggest anyone with a penis gets surgery, it\u2019s a little deeper than that. I wouldn\u2019t go around suggesting people get cosmetic surgery based on one positive anecdote.\u201d \n\nShe tried to apologise and say that it just slipped out and she misspoke, but part of me wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. I said I needed more than an excuse for why she said it and she got really upset, to the point where she insisted I sleep on the couch (we were sharing a bed during the holiday). In my mind, what she said suggested a lack of care for my own autonomy - whether it was meant that way or not. It implied she doesn\u2019t care enough about how it could come across to monitor what I think is quite an intense thing to say.\n\nI guess I wanted her to actually realise what it meant and what saying out loud with such comfort suggests about her views on my bodily autonomy. Again - it being said by mistake is only part of the story. It wasn\u2019t phrased as a suggestion or an option, it was phrased as an instruction. \n\nPersonally, I think being able to say it at all revealed an inherent lack of respect for my body and the choices I make, which is what I needed to hear from her instead of superficial excuses. It isn\u2019t possible that you can say anything by mistake, so apologising in that way meant very little. \n\nSo AITA here? She was really upset that I couldn\u2019t accept her apology, and didn\u2019t seem to realise what I was asking for. I think she\u2019s really intelligent, so it was painful to not hear what I would\u2019ve assumed she could understand and communicate after making a mistake like that.", "created_utc": 1675257488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10quifi/aita_for_not_accepting_my_friends_apology_for/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have no idea why she should even have an opinion on this, much less say it out loud. Hell, even 2000-something years ago there were letters in the Bible about not telling grown men to get circumcised. Sure, that was for religious reasons, but that seems more important than because some girl you aren't dating or marrying thinks you should. She certainly thinks highly of her own opinion, doesn't she?", "NTA She was rude to you, but managed to kick you out of the bed and onto the sofa? i would be dumping her just for that.", "I can't decide if ah or not. It's not her business if you get circuncised or not, but I also don't think it's a big deal what she said. So I say mildly ESH \nFor me it would be more of \"whatever, I don't care about your opinion on my d**k\" and move on.", "NTA but I don't know why her use of the word \"should\" is throwing you off so much. Nowhere did she violate your bodily autonomy. What she said was horrible because randomly suggesting someone have surgery for (I assume) aesthetic purposes is mean. I've had someone tell me I \"should\" get cosmetic surgery and I was offended but I wasn't worried  about my bodily autonomy.\n\nYou definitely are right to be offended as she was out of line but I think you're focusing on the wrong thing.", "\"Foreskin\" is only two letters away from \"for sin\"! Gotta cut off that bit or Satan will crawl up your pee hole and curse you with impure thoughts.", "I think she\u2019d done some minimal research into the potential health/hygiene benefits. By \u201cworked\u201d I think I meant that he was satisfied.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an issue circumcision would fix, and even if there was I would\u2019ve had the same response. There\u2019s suggesting and there\u2019s insisting.", "Yeah, she doesn't sound that bright.  OP is an adult and knows how to take care of his own hygiene.  Plus, does she have a clue what the pain factor would be post-surgery?", "Indeed, she was well aware about the boundary limits she crossed with the comment. She does not seem to comprehend that your r\u00e9actions are yours and not what she wants them to be. What an AH", "Was thinking the same ! How can someone think that is ok to make such comment on another one's body? I don t get it.. and having the entitlement to be then angry about the person's r\u00e9action? Who is she ?? How ?", "Either way, suggesting someone get a permanent body modification they\u2019ve never expressed interest in isn\u2019t appropriate. If she had asked \u201chave you ever wished you were circumcised?\u201d That would be one thing, but it was just as rude as randomly telling a friend with a big nose that they should get a nose job.", "But my point was that the phrasing can\u2019t be misconstrued. If she meant to say something different that\u2019s besides the point, because it\u2019s already been said. If you call someone a slur and apologise by saying it was an accident, it still says something about where you\u2019re at.", "Valuing my own autonomy isn\u2019t a hill to die on?", "weird how you felt the need to throw in there how that\u2019s apparently why you stay away from \u2018foreign men\u2019, when absolutely no one asked..\n\nit\u2019s fine to have a preference. but you just come off ignorant and idiotic. not liking uncircumcised dick is all good - but why bring in the nationality of people.?  you\u2019re just making very broad and prejudice assumptions. \n\nyou\u2019re probably missing out on some amazing people. but, happy for them for dodging that bullet without having to try. \n\nNTA OP", "Omfg.

This appears to be a hill you want to die on, if so I can't stop you. I'd personally think when people use the word 'should' it often is a turn of phrase that does not indicate instruction. Since you're firm in your opinion that it was, then it sounds like the friendship is done.", "Multiple people have told me \"you should go on BakeOff\", none of them are forcing me to go on television against my will. I really think it is possible for people to use \"should\" in a lighter way than you see it. Had she said \"you have to/must\" then it would seem more like a command.", "It doesn't seem like she doesn't value your automony. It seems like she made an off the cuff suggestion and apologized that it hurt you. You're not obligated to forgive her, but you seem to be construing her intentions as massively and insanely evil when she was likely just oblivious and irreverent. She said something unthinking and apologized. She isn't trying to force you into anything and remove your free will. The fact that you keep making it about her lack of respect for your bodily autonomy when she clearly didn't violate your autonomy but made a dumb suggestion is the weird hill.", "No, no, I meant losing the friendship over one comment that she apologized for.", "I was trying to give an perspective of how as an American we have a prejudice against it. Since we grow up differently and most people from other countries do not circumcise their children. It\u2019s not meant to be a dig at anyone. I\u2019m trying to show a perspective of how I was raise. Yes I do stay away because they happpen to be uncircumcised and it smells. As a women it\u2019s so hard being in that situation and finding a way to go home or kick someone out. I just personally can\u2019t do it and I have to make up an excuse not offend someone.

Are you encouraging people to touch themselves?!", "Using \u201cshould\u201d in different contexts has different meanings. This is such a terrible false equivalency, why are you comparing going on bake-off to irreversible surgery?", "Being oblivious to what such a comment implies is not something I look for in friends, and it\u2019s disappointing to hear it from one. Again, a suggestion might have sounded like \u201chave you thought about circumcision? I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s beneficial for some people\u201d. \nPut it into a different context and tell me it\u2019s purely an innocent mistake.\n\u201cYou should get a boob job\u201d\n\u201cYou should get an abortion\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t strawman, I never said she was trying to force anything on me, I was talking about what the comment suggests about her fundamental respect for me.", "Did you even read the post? The apology was empty. Misspeaking =/= accidentally revealing your views.", "If trying to keep Satan out of my dick is wrong, I dont wanna be right.", "Your second response is not showing up in the thread, it has likely been soft blocked due to the language you used. \n\nThe last example you gave is likely what's causing you issue. And yes, those statements do have \"varying levels of appeopriateness\". But, let's face it, there's not a polite way to suggest that last example. You can exchange the word \"should\" in that sentence with something far softer, and it would still be a hugely inappropriate thing to say. The problem isn't really with the \"should\" in that sentence, as \"might consider\" would be equally offensive.", "I'm not comparing those two things. I'm comparing the use of should. Which is the point of the conversation at hand. You seem like you're overly upset. Calling it a false equivalency is a straw man that ignores the real point.", "If someone told me to get a boob job or abortion I'd say \"I'm not looking for opinions, thanks.\" And go on with my day. You're not required to be friends with her any longer. So maybe just stop being friends with her. But I don't know that she was massively evil for a comment she didn't think through and apologized for. If you want a specific apology from her tell her exactly what you'd prefer to hear.", "It sounds like an barely concealed insult tbh. And I dont think it is remotely ambiguous.\n\n\"You should get a nose job\".\n\nThats never going to go down well, for very obvious reasons and nor will an apology make the fact that you think that suddenly evaporate.", "You're just out here encouraging sin. What would Kellogg think of you?!", "I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the asshole for not accepting the apology, not if I should be friends with her. What sub do you think you\u2019re on? I didn\u2019t call her evil. My point was that I expected her to get it and show that she understood, I didn\u2019t really feel like walking her through her own apology.", "If smothering said area with carbolic acid is what it takes, then so be it.\n\nTake THAT Satan!", "I think everyone knows you don't have to accept an apology if you don't want to. But there are nuances. If you're not clear with your communication you're not going to be happy she doesn't meet your expectations. You sound exhausting."]}
