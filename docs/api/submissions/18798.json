My siblings have children & I used to be big part of their life. I\u2019m always taking good care of them.On my free time I never do anything for myself. I spend it always with them bc I love them.I always go above and beyond for them. Not to mention I spent lots of money on them. I\u2019m the aunt that never said no to them. My siblings have more money than me, but all my money seems to go to their children. Now this is not my siblings fault it\u2019s  just what I choose to do. I love them like my own & I never felt like I was being used by my siblings to be a free babysitter bcus I truly enjoyed it from my heart. \nI don\u2019t have friends of my own I considered my siblings my friends.\n\nHowever a year ago I had a terrible injury & couldn\u2019t walk or use my hands for 6+ months. I went from being the girl that helped everyone out to being unable to help myself. I couldn\u2019t walk to the bathroom, kitchen, no where. For the first months of my injury I lost 30 lbs and I was severly skinny. I lost all that weight due to being unable to cook for myself. There were times I needed help even using my spoon (I needed to be fed) no one helped me. There were times I literally cut my hair off because I no longer could take care of my long thick hair. There were times I couldn\u2019t take showers. It was the most depressing time of my life. I went from dealing with my injury to dealing with all kinds of problems due to not taking care of myself not eating properly etc.\n\nFast forward: after months of suffering and struggling I was able to slowly heal \ni was very mad at my family when I finally healed. I realized they used to call me every day before my injury, bcus they could use me as a babysitter but during my injury they acted as if I didn\u2019t exist. There were no phone calls, no checking up on me to see if I need anything nothing. I did have high expectations from them bc we were very close family. I was there for them through anything. But I didn\u2019t receive the same love back. The other day, my sister called me to say her kids miss me and to babysit them. I said NO. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said no. Why\u2019s she calling me now that I\u2019m recovered, when she didn\u2019t show up for me during the worst times of my life she said it\u2019s bcus I never told them i needed help. Now they knew exactly what I was going through. They knew I couldn\u2019t walk, they knew I couldn\u2019t use my hands. They saw me with their own eyes first day of my injury at the hospital then completely disappeared on me. I feel I am only good enough when I\u2019m helping them but when I\u2019m unable to do anything I\u2019m unwanted. I\u2019m going to be all alone but I decided to cut my siblings off of my life permanently. I will no longer be watching their kids for them. I\u2019ve let them know this and have changed my number they think it\u2019s evil to do to your family. \n\nWhat do you guys think.

Every relationship must be a two way street.   It sounds like your siblings only want you when they need something from you.  I feel terrible just reading your post.\n\nYou can still be a great aunt when you can and want to, but you don't have to say \"yes\" every time to be a great aunt.", "NTA but how god damn dare they", "NTA. The only evil people are the ones that up and disappeared when you needed them. Did they ever ask you \"If you need anything, just let me know?\"  Good for you OP for recognizing your worth. I'm truly sorry this happened to you.", "NTA If they want you to babysit, they should pay you. And I'm sorry to hear what you went through, good luck with the recovery <3", "100% NTA, I am so sorry. Go out and make some real friends.", "NTA.\n\nThey showed you who they are, and you are right in believing them. I'm glad you are standing up for yourself and not allowing them to take advantage of you. \n\nUnfortunately, the world is full of people like this. When you start building your family, whether that's with friends or a SO, take care not to give too much of yourself or expect others to go all out for you like you would do for them. I'm sorry you didn't get help from your family.", "NTA thats beyond vile of them to abandon you like that.", "NTA\n\nYes, they might not be able to provide as much support as you needed, but from your post, they just ignored you between the time you were injured and the time you could be useful for them again.", "NTA\n\nI commiserate with you on this too much. When you are hurt and vunerable and people who yoh support and care for normally make you BEG for their support and care, its beyond demeaning. Its harder than the pain\n\nThe worst thing you can do to a normally independent person is make them beg and plead for help when they cant be independent.", "NTA Of course they think withholding free babysitting is \"evil\", it makes their life harder. That nonsense you never said you needed help is pure gaslighting, I would be hurt and angry too.", "WTF did I just read?? NTA. HOLY SHIT. I can\u2019t imagine how soul crushing that must be for you. I\u2019m so sorry they\u2019re treating you like that. I think you are totally right for cutting your siblings off. But\u2026maybe remain open to being in your nieces/nephews lives. Eventually, after taking time to grieve the loss of the relationship with your siblings. They seem to bring you joy, and maybe you\u2019ll find that you need that. Not babysitting, but maybe birthdays and such.", "NTA. Relationships and give and take. In this case everything was great as long as you did all the giving and they did all the taking. Even if they didn't know exactly how you were doing they certainly should have called or texted to see how you were healing.", "NTA: you discovered your family takes but doesn't give.\nStop babysitting and you'll teach them a vital lesson about being fair.", "I think NTA, but I also think if you didn't actually say you needed help, you should have. But clearly you did and clearly they didn't bother and so you're not the asshole at all.", "NTA \n\nMy aunt used to babysit my brother and I all the time. Now that we're adults, she had a stroke. We didn't vanish. We stepped up. We took care of her at home until she could take care of herself. She didn't ask us to. We just did. Your family just left you to rot. I'm so sorry they did this to you.", "NTA- yes they think its evil as all that free sitting is going away.  They knew you'd be injured and saw it with their own eyes.  From the sounds of it they didn't even offer to help with meals or anything like that.  They showed their true colors.  Now you have a chance to go make some friends who will support you and have your back.", "NTA.  If they only want you around to use you, you'll be a lot better off making a new support network that actually supports you", "NTA. Now you know they're users and you can move on", "100% NTA. They should have been there for you during your hardest times and you deserve to be treated in way that makes you feel like you are cared for.\n\nIf you believe your family to be good people, I don't think this is entirely unsalvageable. You are understandably hurt and if they care you should be able to communicate that to your family. How they respond to you should reveal their feelings and values.\n\nBut you know them best, if they are the type to make excuses or you believe they have showed you their true values then you are not wrong for cutting them off.", "NTA. They completely abandoned you once you weren't available to do something for them. Take care and so glad you are doing better!", "They are right, it is evil what they, your family, did to you...\n\nNTA", "NTA. They are your siblings, but not your friends. And I am sorry to say this, but you mean not so much to them when you aren't stepping up as a babysitter.\n\nBuuut OP, you are 23 years old, you are young, go out, explore what you like in life, sports, hiking, painting, traveling whatever, I am sure you will find some new friends when you just put yourself out there. The money you save from now on because you don't spend it on your niblings can be used to treat yourself. Maybe also a holiday where you don't play babysitter would be nice? OP, you recovered from not walking, and be able to use your hand, you are strong. Wishing you all the best :)", "NTA regarding your siblings BUT I do feel if you have a close relationship with their kids, try to still be there for them when you\u2019re able. Just no babysitting. Show up for parties or whatever else to be there for the kids but f your other family (as I\u2019m typing this I realize it\u2019s one of those \u201ceasier said than done\u201d things and maybe cutting everyone off is the only logical way). *sigh*", "NTA. They have no right to call your actions evil just because you\u2019re not jumping to help them anymore when they didn\u2019t even offer to help you. Family relationships like friendships and romantic relationships have to be equal on both sides. Not just one side used and take without giving anything back. \n\nCut them off and build your own family with people you chose to be part of it and who you can trust to be there whenever you need. \n\nAnd I hope you are soon feeling much better. Take care of yourself and don\u2019t listen to the people saying you\u2019re being evil/mean etc. They\u2019re only saying that to try and manipulate you into being the unpaid help again.", "NTA, absolutely. It's terrible how they showed their real skin like that but hopefully your life will turn only better and better from now on.", "NTA    what a bunch of users. \n\nIf you couldn't use your hands, how exactly were you supposed to contact them?\n\nI am so sorry they deserted you during your time of need, I would also cut them off. \n\nIt's a horrible thing to realize that the people, who you believed loved you, are just looking out for themselves.", "NTA, when someone shows you their true colors believe it.  On the other hand, they saw you immediately following your injury.  They also didn't have crystal balls, so if you needed help, that was when you should have spoken up and simply not expected them to check in...etc.  You should have asked, very clearly.  I know you have done a lot for them, but they also called you or otherwise communciated their needs to you.  You didn't give them the same opportunity.  \n\n\nI am glad your setting some boundaries.  Visit with your nieces and nephews without being the care taker or go very low contact with your family.", "Definitely NTA , but try not to punish the kids or yourself. I'm sorry you're going through this!", "NTA but as a person in a similar situation I found that responding the way you are hurt me more than them.\n\nThey just aren't loving/considerate people. Or at least it doesn't show in a proactive way with you. \n\nI'm the eldest and I'm always proactively thinking about and helping my family. Its who I am. It's how I show love and I really enjoy doing it. \n\nI know now that I can't rely on them to proactively meet my needs. That I have to explicitly ask for everything I need from them and be explicit about how I need that need to be met. \n\nIm a proactive lover because I'm a proactive lover and I'm going to be me even if others aren't going to return the favor. I don't enjoy withholding myself from people I care about for better or worse. \n\nNow I definitely don't sacrifice as much since this revelation but I'm still there loving them. \n\nAs a fellow lover, good luck out there. It can be a cold and uncaring world.", "NTA but I do think you are cutting off your nose to spite your face.  \n\nSo sorry and sad that your family was oblivious to your needs when you were so injured. Honestly, I have no idea how they could have missed your needing their help.  Shame on them all for that.\n\nI'd suggest you try to maintain some contact with your nieces and nephews when it is convenient for you.  You love them and I am sure they love you.  That said, you are totally within your rights to no longer be the free babysitter.  You are young and should be off doing your thing instead of being a free babysitter.  Just visit when you feel like it. Stand up for yourself and don't hesitate to tell your siblings why you are no longer at their beck and call.  \n\nHealthy relationships are two-way.  Sounds like you've been the giver to those who take but don't think to reciprocate.  You are right to no longer be their doormat.", "NTA but you already know that", "NTA but also a very very small esh for hurting the kids in the crossfire, so to speak. You\u2019re 100% justified in cutting off your siblings and in a weird way I\u2019m glad that happened to you so you were able to see the kind of people they really are and cut them out of your life. However, you very clearly love your nieces and nephews and it sucks that they will also be hurt in this when they didn\u2019t do anything, and very likely will feel abandoned by you since they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and I doubt their parents will be honest with them about why you went no contact. I think you should consider keeping some line of communication open for them to continue having a relationship with you, not necessarily through your siblings of course, but depending on how old they are if you can reach out to them directly to explain what happened and that you still love them and want to be in their lives.", "NTA. But I don't think it's fair to your nieces and nephews if you break off ties with them. They are most likely too young to understand about the falling out between you and their parents and they'll be heartbroken if they never hear from you or see you again. Best to just let your siblings know how hurt you are by them and that you don't want a relationship with them but you absolutely want to keep a relationship with their kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
