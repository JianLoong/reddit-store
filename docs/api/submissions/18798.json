My siblings have children & I used to be big part of their life. I\u2019m always taking good care of them.On my free time I never do anything for myself. I spend it always with them bc I love them.I always go above and beyond for them. Not to mention I spent lots of money on them. I\u2019m the aunt that never said no to them. My siblings have more money than me, but all my money seems to go to their children. Now this is not my siblings fault it\u2019s  just what I choose to do. I love them like my own & I never felt like I was being used by my siblings to be a free babysitter bcus I truly enjoyed it from my heart. \nI don\u2019t have friends of my own I considered my siblings my friends.\n\nHowever a year ago I had a terrible injury & couldn\u2019t walk or use my hands for 6+ months. I went from being the girl that helped everyone out to being unable to help myself. I couldn\u2019t walk to the bathroom, kitchen, no where. For the first months of my injury I lost 30 lbs and I was severly skinny. I lost all that weight due to being unable to cook for myself. There were times I needed help even using my spoon (I needed to be fed) no one helped me. There were times I literally cut my hair off because I no longer could take care of my long thick hair. There were times I couldn\u2019t take showers. It was the most depressing time of my life. I went from dealing with my injury to dealing with all kinds of problems due to not taking care of myself not eating properly etc.\n\nFast forward: after months of suffering and struggling I was able to slowly heal \ni was very mad at my family when I finally healed. I realized they used to call me every day before my injury, bcus they could use me as a babysitter but during my injury they acted as if I didn\u2019t exist. There were no phone calls, no checking up on me to see if I need anything nothing. I did have high expectations from them bc we were very close family. I was there for them through anything. But I didn\u2019t receive the same love back. The other day, my sister called me to say her kids miss me and to babysit them. I said NO. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said no. Why\u2019s she calling me now that I\u2019m recovered, when she didn\u2019t show up for me during the worst times of my life she said it\u2019s bcus I never told them i needed help. Now they knew exactly what I was going through. They knew I couldn\u2019t walk, they knew I couldn\u2019t use my hands. They saw me with their own eyes first day of my injury at the hospital then completely disappeared on me. I feel I am only good enough when I\u2019m helping them but when I\u2019m unable to do anything I\u2019m unwanted. I\u2019m going to be all alone but I decided to cut my siblings off of my life permanently. I will no longer be watching their kids for them. I\u2019ve let them know this and have changed my number they think it\u2019s evil to do to your family. \n\nWhat do you guys think.

I'm sorry you didn't get help from your family.", "NTA thats beyond vile of them to abandon you like that.", "NTA\n\nYes, they might not be able to provide as much support as you needed, but from your post, they just ignored you between the time you were injured and the time you could be useful for them again.", "NTA\n\nI commiserate with you on this too much. When you are hurt and vunerable and people who yoh support and care for normally make you BEG for their support and care, its beyond demeaning.

That nonsense you never said you needed help is pure gaslighting, I would be hurt and angry too.", "WTF did I just read?? NTA. HOLY SHIT. I can\u2019t imagine how soul crushing that must be for you. I\u2019m so sorry they\u2019re treating you like that. I think you are totally right for cutting your siblings off. But\u2026maybe remain open to being in your nieces/nephews lives.

I'm so sorry they did this to you.", "NTA- yes they think its evil as all that free sitting is going away.  They knew you'd be injured and saw it with their own eyes.

Now you have a chance to go make some friends who will support you and have your back.", "NTA.

They should have been there for you during your hardest times and you deserve to be treated in way that makes you feel like you are cared for.\n\nIf you believe your family to be good people, I don't think this is entirely unsalvageable. You are understandably hurt and if they care you should be able to communicate that to your family.

The money you save from now on because you don't spend it on your niblings can be used to treat yourself. Maybe also a holiday where you don't play babysitter would be nice?

They have no right to call your actions evil just because you\u2019re not jumping to help them anymore when they didn\u2019t even offer to help you. Family relationships like friendships and romantic relationships have to be equal on both sides.

On the other hand, they saw you immediately following your injury.  They also didn't have crystal balls, so if you needed help, that was when you should have spoken up and simply not expected them to check in...etc.  You should have asked, very clearly.  I know you have done a lot for them, but they also called you or otherwise communciated their needs to you.  You didn't give them the same opportunity.  \n\n\nI am glad your setting some boundaries.  Visit with your nieces and nephews without being the care taker or go very low contact with your family.", "Definitely NTA , but try not to punish the kids or yourself. I'm sorry you're going through this!", "NTA but as a person in a similar situation I found that responding the way you are hurt me more than them.\n\nThey just aren't loving/considerate people. Or at least it doesn't show in a proactive way with you. \n\nI'm the eldest and I'm always proactively thinking about and helping my family. Its who I am. It's how I show love and I really enjoy doing it. \n\nI know now that I can't rely on them to proactively meet my needs. That I have to explicitly ask for everything I need from them and be explicit about how I need that need to be met. \n\nIm a proactive lover because I'm a proactive lover and I'm going to be me even if others aren't going to return the favor. I don't enjoy withholding myself from people I care about for better or worse. \n\nNow I definitely don't sacrifice as much since this revelation but I'm still there loving them. \n\nAs a fellow lover, good luck out there. It can be a cold and uncaring world.", "NTA but I do think you are cutting off your nose to spite your face.  \n\nSo sorry and sad that your family was oblivious to your needs when you were so injured. Honestly, I have no idea how they could have missed your needing their help.  Shame on them all for that.\n\nI'd suggest you try to maintain some contact with your nieces and nephews when it is convenient for you.  You love them and I am sure they love you.  That said, you are totally within your rights to no longer be the free babysitter.  You are young and should be off doing your thing instead of being a free babysitter.  Just visit when you feel like it. Stand up for yourself and don't hesitate to tell your siblings why you are no longer at their beck and call.  \n\nHealthy relationships are two-way.  Sounds like you've been the giver to those who take but don't think to reciprocate.  You are right to no longer be their doormat.", "NTA but you already know that", "[deleted]", "NTA. But I don't think it's fair to your nieces and nephews if you break off ties with them. They are most likely too young to understand about the falling out between you and their parents and they'll be heartbroken if they never hear from you or see you again. Best to just let your siblings know how hurt you are by them and that you don't want a relationship with them but you absolutely want to keep a relationship with their kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like they put a lot of the financial burden of having children on OP by getting the kids to ask her for stuff, knowing \u201cshe\u2019s the aunt who never said no.\u201d Plus the burden of caring for the kids. If she was there during all her free time, she was probably doing the bulk of the childcare, even if the parents were home. \n\nIf they actually cared, the kids wouldn\u2019t be missing her, because they would have been seeing her regularly as the parents were helping her recover. The kids may have even been really happy and excited to help their beloved aunt who always helps them. But they were denied that opportunity because OP wasn\u2019t useful to their parents.", "NTA - this is what I was going to say!  The nieces and nephews aren\u2019t at fault here but no more free babysitting. Here is hoping that OP can now go out and do some fun stuff for herself and make some friends.", "The problem I find with this if she\u2019s struggling to spoon feed herself even how was she supposed to contact them?", "how in the world does OP suck here", ">To them, you didn\u2019t ask for help, so they didn\u2019t know you wanted it from them. And they had no idea you were furious with them for not meeting your unspoken expectations.  \n>  \n>And now you\u2019ve gone scorched earth because you feel used and betrayed.  \n>  \n>It absolutely sounds like they got way too comfortable with how willingly you gave of yourself, and they 100% should have been showing up for you more while you were injured and in need. They certainly fell short here.\n\nyeah no they loved op for the free child care and now taht she isnt giving it she is evil please learn to read a post before blaming OP for having. reasonable reaction to her family literallly using her as a free babysitter and ignoring her when she no longer provided that service. Her family knew how bad her injuries were and did nothing.", "Hopefully it makes you appreciate what you have more and if not hopefully it can be a place to vent.", "OP, the way you got through this experience, and the way you cared for your family before this, shows that you have so many good qualities. Qualities that normal people would be honoured to have in their lives. Your family doesn\u2019t deserve you, they\u2019re not worthy. This has proven how strong you are; you don\u2019t need them.  \n\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "If they can call her daily for childcare, they can call her regularly to check in on her after a massive injury.", "so you know your sibling has be seriously injured and dont call or check in on her in six months but the min you find out she is okay then you call her for free babysitting like before. \n\nSounds like your just like OPs siblings and use people for your own needs and ignore  them when they need your help", "Their kids suddenly miss you now that you have full use of your body again ? Go no contact with your siblings and don\u2019t give in to the gaslighting. Hope you make some good friends to spend your life and free time with and heal your soul.", "Being unable to walk or use your hands would constitute a burden but that\u2019s too bad. She could have died during her recovery and her despicable siblings would not have known.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but I am just furious at OP\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d.", "Yes, exactly! I know how OP feels. My sibs treated me the same way. NTA", "The fact that they were previously in regular contact asking for OP\u2019s help, but when OP was injured the contact stopped completely, speaks volumes. The only explanation is that they knew the extent of her situation and didn\u2019t want to help.  \nOP can\u2019t look after the kids and actually needs them to help - no phone calls.\nOP is recovered and can now provide services again - the phone calls resume.  \n\nIt\u2019s hard to fathom how disgusting these people are. Did OP have medical professionals calling in, or access to outside help? While she was injured, she could have died for all the family knew. What if her mobility was affected causing her to fall and she just lay there for days?", "im sorry but your take is really wrong. OPs family was in constant communication with her prior to her injury and knew she was injured and how serious it was. It doesnt require a genius to realize that she needs help. They are back to talking ot her now that she is healed and can be their baby-sitter. \n\nThe fact that you think its here fault shows how bad of a person you are tbh.", "Found the siblings", "you know what stop blaming OP for the kids losing out on her being in their lives thats on their parents for treating her so badly. Is it OPs fault she got injured ? Is it her fault her siblings are pathetic people who use her and only care when she provides free babysitting \n\nbut hey lets blame the victim,.", "This! My family (most of them!) immediately go into schedule/rotation mode and we all figure it out and cover visits, meals, grooming if necessary and helping around the house.", "But if the siblings took the kids for a visit, then the siblings would have been obligated to help. By dropping contact they can now play this BS \u201cwe didn\u2019t know!\u201d story.  \n\nThe truth is that while OP was incapacitated, she was no use to them, so they didn\u2019t want to spend time or put in effort. They knew she was struggling, they just didn\u2019t care.  \nThey\u2019re unspeakably awful.", "I don't understand all the E-S-H or comments that OP should have asked for help. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but this kind of severe injury would have had all my family checking in constantly - even those far away. Someone with this level of need shouldn't have to reach out to be in the right. NTA and I hope you recover well OP.", "My heart is breaking - glad you are healed in body\u2026 what a lonely cruel time. NTA.", "NTA. Hope you get well and use this time to develop hobbies!", "NTA - you deserve better family", "NTA enjoy your freedom.", "She shifted blame. No ma'am, take care of yourself! Self love is not selfish! You deserve better they're angry they're losing their benefits not that they hurt you so, please put  your self first today and always.\nBest of luck hon!", "NTA 100%.  While you didn\u2019t say how old your siblings kids are, I am sure that they are at least old enough to realize, hey\u2026fun aunt hasn\u2019t been around\u2026is she okay?   I mean, if the kids are old enough to tell your sister that they miss you being around, I would think that they are old enough to wonder if you were okay after your injury.   cut them all out of your life but be sure to let that be the end of it-don\u2019t carry it with you.  And you won\u2019t be all alone-create your own family now that you are on the way to being healed physically and mentally.", "NTA, you basically did to them what they did to you. Hope your recovery is going well", "NTA.\n\nSorry that it took such a horrible experience to make it obvious.", "Honestly, it sounds like this is a life lesson you need to learn. Doing what\u2019s best for you is never selfish. It\u2019s what you need to do!!! How they reacted to you in your time of need tells you everything that you need to know. \n\nI do believe though that the children are not involved Unfortunately, your siblings behaved shitty but that shouldn\u2019t compromise the relationship you have with their children if that is important to you. I would suggest trying to make boundaries that are focused on your time and schedule not on theirs.", "No, you are not the asshole.  And I am sorry your family did this to you.", "NTA. That's shitty of them not to reciprocate all the help you gave. I hope you're doing much better now!\n\nMy only caveat: if your niblings try to get back in touch with you someday, please keep in mind that what their parents ~~did~~ failed to do isn't their fault. You don't have to become close or start babysitting again, but just be careful not to lash out at them.", "NTA. Users be losers. You need to concentrate on yourself now, to live your best life.", "NTA- your life, your choices. You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to do anything. I know you love them but there should always be healthy boundaries set.", "NTA", "Your damily sucks. Ditch them and spend your free time finding people who aren't trash. Nta", "NTA.  It sounds like your injury, as unfortunate as it was, showed you what was really going on.", "Oh love. You're not the AH. Those who should have helped and protected you through your illness - they abandoned and neglected you when you needed them most. Maybe you didn't ask, but they knew and chose to put you out of their minds. At least until you were useful again. That is not how you show love.\n\nIt's time to try and build a chosen family. All that time that you spent on your siblings? As you continue to heal, figure out what you actually like to do. Crafts, gaming, cooking, learning a new language, whatever - there are communities out there (locally, and if not, online). \n\nBut I think that some sort of therapy is in order. You went through a traumatic experience with your illness, you're going through one now realizing that your family isn't great. Whether that's through one on one therapy, support groups, whatever - I really think that you should talk to someone experienced in this type of thing. (Sadly, there are a lot of them where I'm at. I hope that there are some near you too.)\n\nReddit can tell you that you're NTA, but that is just validation. As important as that can be, it's not enough for you.\n\nI'll tell you that I don't want you to be or feel alone. But you need someone in your proximity to help you. I hope that you get that help, that support. I'll just say that you're definitely not the AH. You're right to cut off your family (at least until they get their heads on straight), and that I hope that you make relationships outside of your family. \n\nSending so much love to you. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA .The only asshole here is your family for letting you suffer in such a way when you needed them the most. You have every right to cut them off and I applaud you for that. I hope you're living a happy life these days.", "NTA- Good job!!! Your family sucks. Hugs!", "NTA", "NTA - reading your story broke my heart. My siblings and I aren\u2019t the closest, but dang\u2026 there is no way I\u2019d leave them high and dry like that.", "NOT AT ALL THE ASSHOLE OMG", "NTA. There is nobody more selfish than a parent. You can NEVER trust or rely on any of them to ever help you, but by God will they use you up and scream about \"the village\". I wouldn't give them a minute of your time or a cent of your money.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for you OP reading all this. Your family is not worth anything.\n\n>I\u2019m going to be all alone \n\nI know it can be hard, but I am sure you will meet other people and make friends. Just give it a try.", "NTA I didn't have nearly as horrific an injury as you had, but I realised quickly who was there for me and who wasn't when I had health issues. I no longer reach out to those who weren't there for me.  One of them reached out after two years to check with me. I'm like TWO. YEARS. it took you to notice we weren't in touch? Fuck off.", "\"Sorry, I couldn't pick up the phone just like I couldn't brush my hair or feed myself. I'm not watching your kids anymore since none of you seem to value me beyond that of a volunteer you can abandon when you need help saving money\"\n\nNTA", "You were nothing more than free help to them. You owe them nothing, very literally nothing. They were absolutely horrible to you. NTA.", "\u201cIgnorance,\u201d \u201c solution based approach\u201d? Where in your comment is simple common sense? The siblings were told from the very beginning OP can\u2019t walk, OP can\u2019t use her hands, OP can\u2019t live alone. Where in that explanation of OP\u2019s injuries is the need for OP to communicate that she needed help. Simple common sense would tell most people that she would require help without having to communicate it to the people standing next to her bed when the doctor gave those instructions. Does it occur to you that OP might\u2019ve struggled to use a telephone to communicate in the beginning? It became obvious fairly early in her recovery that there would be no help forthcoming from her asshole siblings. She figured out all by herself how to survive all on her own.", "No. Just no. \n\nThe parameters you\u2019re trying to ascribe here puts an unfair onus on the OP. You\u2019re trying to say that she should\u2019ve reached out to her siblings to ask for help, when they themselves heard that OP will need help for recovery. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is that people like the OP\u2019s family cannot discern the most basic of communication.  They need to be told the obviously glaring fact that their sister was in need of help? Hell no. \n\nYou don\u2019t ask an injured person to require asking  for help from people who are supposed to care about them. They trusted her with their children. She\u2019s good enough to babysit them. When they have a chance to do something to help, they willingly failed her at every turn.", "Why everyone looking for OP to maintain a relationship with her nieces and nephews, it's obvious she's can't without being taken advantage of by her siblings.", "Why? By the time she could actually reach out it was obvious that her family just didn\u2019t give a damn."]}
