After we signed the lease, she told me she is a \"trust fund baby\" but does not like to boast about it. I told her I am not interested in spending crazy money to furnish a rented apartment as I will be moving out in a year as I'm getting engaged. Between the 3 weeks of signing the lease and moving in, she already planned on furnishing the living room with a total expense of over $4k, and asked me to split the bill. We had a huge disagreement on that, and we ended up splitting and came to an agreement. We have 13 paintings, a $1.5k sofa and a $800 TV, of which I get the TV and sofa when I move out and she can keep her paintings.\n\nI work 4/5 days in office and even sometimes on weekends, and she's remote almost everyday and currently it has come to a state where I feel like I am living in her apartment and she is the owner. I literally have nothing in the living room except for my PS5 which is shoved in a corner. She also has a cleaning problem. She lives alone in the house almost everyday and yet vacuums it thrice a day and needs to house to be as if no one has lived in it.\n\nI got a PS5 for me 2 months back and the position of it changes almost everyday and it came to a point where it almost fell and was going to break. She asked me to pack it up and keep it inside because it doesn't match the \"aesthetic\" of the room after which i told her to f\\*\\*\\* off and get a life. 2 weeks back I got a limited edition remote for my PS to play with and she got furious because again it did not match the \"living room\" but I didn't care. I came back from work to see there was a new remote in the house and when I asked her where my old one is, she said she returned it and got a new one to match the living room. She entered my room, found the receipts in one of my bags and went to the store to exchange it.\n\nI got super furious on her and said she had no right to touch my things to which she said I hardly live in the house so I should not care. I called the cops in front of her and reported theft in my apartment.\n\nAITA?\n\n**UPDATE:** She doesn't live alone because in her words, \"it's not about money. it's about the experience of living with someone\", but the truth being her parents won't let her stay alone even though she's 32!
