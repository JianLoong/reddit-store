I didn\u2019t know what to do with that so I took a picture of it as proof when I asked him about it. I don\u2019t end up confronting him as I didn\u2019t want the argument. \n\nHowever last night I had asked him to send me pictures of our son which he had taken on his phone all day and he just didn\u2019t so when he was sleeping I decided to just send me to me myself to my surprise my husband had taken my Face ID off and changed his passcode.

You found something which confirmed he's being a bit shady due to the comment to the girl.  Not cool of him at all.\n\nOut of curiosity, why did you guys get. married so young?  Was it due to the baby?  Unfortunately marriage won't necessarily automatically make someone more committed to a relationship.  21 is very young, especially for males \"Do men fully mature at 25?  \nAccording to a study by Dr. Sandra Aamodt, most people, especially men, do not reach full maturity until age 25. At this age, our brains fully develop and can make more mature, well-thought out life decisions.\"  I'm a woman and I can tell you personally I was a much different person at 21 than I am now.  \n\nThe porn issue is a personal preference.  Some people are okay with it and some aren't.  I'm fine with it.  That being said, I'd still feel shy about my partner seeing what I've watched, etc.  It's okay to have some things be just yours and have privacy on those things.\n\nI think your post says you didn't confront him about the comment he made to the girl?  It's not a mature healthy relationship to keep that to yourself and let it fester.  How can you guys communicate and have a healthy relationships if you're not sharing when something major bothers you?  Avoiding conflict is never healthy.  I used to do it all the time.  Just causes anxiety and depression.  You have to struggled alone and worry he's up to something and don't have any reassurance from him.  Then you have to feel crazy because you want to keep going through his stuff.  Just have an open conversation.", "YTA try giving the benefit of the doubt", "NTA.  But also not in a healthy relationship.  I don\u2019t think any amount of rooting in a private phone will end well.  Trust has been breeches on both sides and you guys need to work on that or split. \n\nI would start by asking if he is happy.  And that will probably draw out into a great argument but at least you guys get to hang your laundry out.  \n\nI don\u2019t personally think phones are there to root through.  That being said I have nothing to hide on mine so should my significant other need that to validate something, then whatever.  I would want her to be upfront about it instead of sneaky.  But if this guy is cheating he\u2019s an AH regardless of what you did to prove it.  He\u2019s a bigger AH on if he dwells on that privacy breech instead of his own infidelity.", "NTA I would be suspicious too. He raises some red flags for being weirdly protective about his phone. I would think he has something to hide, too. However,  maybe he is just embarrassed because he is into tentacle porn or something a little off the beaten path. The question is did he change the passcode because he caught you snooping or because he is cheating? Maybe suggest you want to change it up a little in the bedroom and incorporate tentacles and see how he reacts.", "I personally see porn as wired too we always speak about it and I don\u2019t watch it I don\u2019t get enjoyment out of it and he always says he doesn\u2019t so it\u2019s a bit annoying to find out he does but I\u2019m not 100% worried about it   \n\nAlso thank u for the advice", "NTA, he\u2019s giving red flags", "Ooof. \n\nIt sounds like the trust is broken, and that's a bad sign for any relationship. \n\nRebuilding that will take some dedication from both sides.", "i feel like y\u2019all are both the asshole cause well yeah that\u2019s his phone and you shouldn\u2019t go through it but he shouldn\u2019t be so protective over it like that, so you had good reason to go through it", "YTA for snooping. Full Stop. \n\nIs he cheating? I don't know, not enough evidence. You went through his phone and didn't find any thing that would suggest him cheating. The \"worst\" you found is him reassuring some girl telling her \"she is beautiful just the way you are.\"  What a nice thing to say to someone. Doesn't mean he's banging her. Sheesh.\n\nAs far as the porn goes... You may not have a problem with it, but have you told him. He may be embarrassed about it and doesn't want you to see that he has porn on his phone. Just because someone is protective over their privacy doesn't mean they are cheating. \n\nFrom the looks of it you have a history of going through his phone. He has even yelled at you about it. This tells him that you have a problem with boundaries. Then he changes his passcode because you were snooping and now your mad because you can't snoop? TFOH\n\nAre you projecting? Are you insecure? Do you have open healthy communication?  Answer these questions before you jump to conclusions.", "GET AN ANULLMENT!One day it\u2019s lose his temper and yell, the next day it could be lose his temper and hit. You have only been married for a few months and he has shown more red flags than China. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re 21. You barely reached the age to drink.

No. But HE was right to be concerned - he was RIGHT not to trust you.", "YTA - going down his phone with out permission.", "YTA for invading his privacy.", "It's a tough one. On one hand, if someone is being untrustworthy it doesn't really extend your rights towards their privacy, on the other, your concern is pretty reasonable.\n\nCould he be preparing a surprise for you? Do you have any upcoming celebrations (anniversary, birthdays, etc)? Maybe he just wants to keep it a secret.\n\nHas he become more distant in the past? You mentioned him being more sensitive to his phone, are there other occasions where he acts differently?\n\nI don't want to say that you're the asshole, because if your suspicion gets confirmed then he is the asshole, but if it doesn't, then that would kind of make you one, jealousy is a basic human emotion, albeit an ugly one. Usually the best way around jealousy is just talking to your husband. Voice your concerns without accusing him of anything and see what he says, if you're married you should be able to tell if he's bsing or not.\n\nAlso, did you get married because you got pregnant or because both of you actually wanted it? Sorry if it's insensitive to ask, but I feel like an answer to this might shed light on this behavior too.", "ESH\n\nIt generally isn't a good thing to go through someone's phone without their permission, though that's a little more of a grey area when you are married.\n\nHis responses sounds pretty violent and I'm concerned for your safety as things only escalate.

But people aren't always embarrassed because they're guilty of something it also might be something they're ashamed of.\n\nAlthough, porn in history is kind of weird in my opinion, usually means that the person isn't satisfied sexually, otherwise what's the need of porn?\n\nYou mentioned seeing a message on his phone to a girl, did you recognize the number or the name of the person? Was the message on say Whatsapp? Because if it was, he could have figured out that you checked his phone through WhatsApp's last seen feature. Say whoever he was texting saw that he went online and later informed him of it. \n\nWhat's weird to me too is that he deleted your face id off his phone. Like you have to go to certain lengths of paranoia to do that, I think I still have the face id of my friend that I haven't seen in a couple of years, just because we added it when we were drunk and I could never be bothered to go into the settings and delete em, same goes for prints. Something is definitely fishy here, I just think that you need to stay calm for now and have a conversation with him as his wife, at the end of the day you have all the rights to voice your concerns to him, but don't start accusing him outright, see what his reaction is to basic questions.\n\nAlso, you can create a situation, in which your phone is basically dead and you need to call someone, so you'll have to use his phone for that, see what his reaction is to that. If he's gonna go crazy and say stuff like \"tell me the number, I'll dial it myself\", then that might be a \ud83d\udea9", "Yup, that ^^^", "Does she have evidence for his disloyalty because all Im seeing here Is her snooping without any consideration to his privacy, a simple text message is not evidence, is he embarrassed because of his porn addiction? why not ask her about it before jumping to conclusions.", "Bruh, I never was in a relationship before so don\u2019t accuse me of something I never did. Anyways I was asking a question so give me an answer.", "Being married doesn\u2019t mean you lose all privacy rights.

So yes. He\u2019s being shady and won\u2019t allow her access at all?", "So I guess it is more \"found the person who has no idea what they are talking about\".", "So if you never have been in a relationship before maybe you don\u2019t understand the nuances of a relationship. Generally if someone becomes secretive and has extreme reactions to you asking about something, they are hiding something they don\u2019t want you to know about.\n\nAnd when that person is supposed to be your life partner it usually means they have an interest elsewhere"]}
