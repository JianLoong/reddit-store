One that recognizes that Reddit is ultimately a for-profit entity, but still has a community of users to serve. While we appreciate that some of you are disappointed we didn't jump on the bandwagon early on, we have been careful to ensure we fully understand what we're protesting - to what extent reddit plans to come to the table and how they stack up to industry best practices around communication and community management.\n\nWe do not begrudge Reddit's efforts to become profitable. Reddit employs thousands of people and it requires consistent and predictable sources of revenue to address its operating costs to keep them employed. Paid APIs are standard in the industry. Concerns about controls over NSFW, ad content, etc., are also standard in the industry. \n\nBut at the same time, we do not begrudge any users who have been understandably upset by these changes. Maybe you were simply blind-sided by the insanely short time frame. Maybe you were justifiably outraged by Reddit\u2019s choices that failed to prioritize user experience and accessibility. Either way, you weren\u2019t wrong. Our position was to wait before announcing a blackout, simply to see if any positive news would surface. The calls, posts, and AMA from the past week have not left us feeling confident about Reddit\u2019s recent decisions or the path that things will take moving forward.\n\nA 30 day timeframe between a formal announcement and changes taking effect is unheard of. It\u2019s also inadequate for a change that requires a complete 180 in the business model to remain sustainable.\n\n*Reddit is asking these companies to do in 30 days what it cannot even commit to a vague timeline to do with its own app.* Just a non-specific, non-committable promise to do better. You cannot reasonably tell us this takes time while unironically giving third party partners 30 days to change their entire operating model. *Do you hear yourselves?*\n\nIn our calls with Reddit, we clearly stated: the status quo is not sustainable. If they have not heard us by now, we genuinely don\u2019t know what we could say here that will make an impact. We\u2019re at a loss. We know those we speak with listen and care deeply. We know they advocate for us and pass our feedback on. We also see, through the actions of the company, that this feedback is not always acted upon. The key decision makers don't seem to be getting it. We are not satisfied with the hand-waving and unspecific answers. At this point, we feel the appropriate next step is to go private from June 12-14. We do not expect this to be the end and will continue to reevaluate the best way to help uplift the voices of Reddit\u2019s users and partners.\n\nWe appreciate the community\u2019s support in this effort. It is with our deepest apologies that we rob you of a source of entertainment during meetings that could have been an email, the train ride to work, breaktime scrolling, or whatever your poison. \n\nFinal note - remember the human. I know a lot of you have clocked some years in the corporate world. As a large sub we\u2019ve had an on-going relationship with the admins. Admins =/= execs, and many of the folks having to deliver the unpopular messages lately are not making the decisions. They\u2019re not c-suite. Some may even feel the same way you do about these changes. In a time where tech layoffs are at a high and many are just hoping to keep a roof over their head, please do try to keep your cool and keep feedback respectful and actionable, even if passionate and at times downright angry.", "created_utc": 1686364148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145o4jz/aita_for_blocking_your_goto_time_killer_from_june/", "score": 5081, "replies": []}
