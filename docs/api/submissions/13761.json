Like many other mechanics, one of the first things I had to do was buy my own tools as very few garages supply them.

This roommate was Jared who despite being a plumber likes to do his own auto work. While working we were approached by our other roommate Ashley(24 F). After seeing us working on the cars she asked if she could borrow my tools to do her tires. She explained how she watched a video and wanted to do it herself to save money. In the kindest way possible I told her no while explaining that I don't lend my tools to anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe didn't like this and started going off about how I am lying with the only \"real\" reason being that I am sexist against women. Luckily Jared stepped in and backed me up by telling her there is a difference between household tools and a professional's equipment. She didn't accept this and started cussing at us before storming off. The following day things took a drastic turn with her. While Jared and I were out she stole my tools and tried to do her tire changes. Long story short, we came back to the fire department blocking the parking lot as she had ruptured her car's gas tank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the aftermath of this, my response to her was simple, I told her that she was going to clean up her mess and that I won't be expediting her car's repairs. This was fine until she realized that it would be at least a month until she could be seen with the estimate being just over 1,500$ excluding tow costs. Additionally she also learned that insurance won't help her at all with this.  This led to her demanding that I get her car seen immediately because she needs it for University and work.  In response I told her no and that not having her car serviced immediately is her punishment for stealing my tools.  She didn't like this and complained to her friends who alongside her are all saying that I am at fault and am a huge asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1680385983, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12904uu/aita_for_refusing_to_share_my_toolkit_and_then/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At all!***    What a stupid woman.

You set boundaries for your expensive tools. She massively disrespect them. And now you need to bail her out? Hell no.", "NTA\n\nPetty but I love it. \n\nYou aren't just not lending the tools to her, but no one. Fair treatment across the board and it is professional equipment.\n\nShe clearly didn't know what she was doing. She needs to learn actions have consequences.", "NTA. It is completely standard for people in skilled trades to have firm rules about their tools. She's trying to have an opinion about something she's completely ignorant about on top of all of her other flaws. And how did she rupture the gas tank on a tire change?", "NTA. I know very few mechanics that will loan tools. Sorry if that offends someone in need.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to suffer the consequences of her actions. Shes an adult.", "NTA, She stole from you, end of story. Fuck around, find out, and find out she did.", "NTA. She got herself into this when she borrowed your tools without permission, knowing that you wouldn't allow it, and damaged her own car. You owe her nothing. She has treated you with nothing but disrespect, including the recent complaints behind your back. You could be the \"bigger person\" and help her out, and I'd admire you for it; but you don't owe her that.", "NTA, she f'd around and found out.  She's earned her karma.", "NTA, I guess that youtube video she watched wasn't all that good, if she punctured her gas tank while *checks notes* trying to rotate her tires?  Did she put the jack through the gas tank? That's my guess.", "NTA, she stole your equipment. I've known dope head who would car hop, and that's the one thing they wouldn't even touch.\n\nThat being said. My response to her initial request would be to offer to help her change the tire. She obviously had no idea wtf she was doing. \n\nAlso, I'm conflicted on the expediting of the repairs. On one hand, she did take your tools after getting an explicit no. But on the other you have to live with her. It might be best for everyone if you can pull some strings to get it done quicker. Maybe let her sweat it out for a week then get it to the top of the list.\n\nOr you tell her to watch another YouTube video on changing a gas tank. Would be interesting to see how that one ends up lol.", "If the tools were damaged, go after her for such.\n\nNTA in any way. She didn't like your answer and threw a fit. She stole tools and caused an explosion. Report her to the cops as well.\n\nAlthough for legal reasons, I would not work on her vehicle and have someone else do it.", "NTA.

She absolutely should not have used your tools without permission, but I would think the $1500 bill is punishment enough, and you artificially delaying her ability to get her car back is an AH move.\n\nBased on OP's claim that he is not artificially delaying her repair, NTA.

Explain that to her, and that the job she has requires the same hoists that those cars are booked in for, and that you cannot expedite her repairs due to that. Don\u2019t make it about her behaviour - it\u2019s shitty she \u201cBorrowed\u201d your tools, but the real punishment here is the $2k and three weeks off the road for her own stupidity (how the hell do you put a hole in your gas tank changing your tyres?!!!).
