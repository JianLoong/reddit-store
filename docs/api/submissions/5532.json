She just asked if you would contribute, which doesn't make her an AH. \n\nPools are deemed an 'attractive nuisance' by many home owner insurance companies. They're a liability to a home-owner, not an asset. Depending on where you live, having it filled in is better than repairing it. \n\nBut, it is nice for your kids to be able to use a pool. If you decide you do want to contribute, make her share the estimates or quotes she's gotten with you. That way you can know if she's padding the bill.

Doesn\u2019t matter if your shared children use it. The pool is literally at *her* house which makes *her* responsible for all upkeep/financials pertaining to the property. Next she\u2019ll be asking you to pay for her rent just because your sons go over to her house. It simply doesn\u2019t make sense. Keep shutting it down if she asks again.", "NTA.

It's her property to repair and has nothing to do with the kids.", "If you have the money it\u2019s a nice gesture but no, no obligation.", "This seems like the rare case in which no one is the asshole imo. Unless she is throwing a fit over you saying no, of course.

Your ex apparently thinks that you should foot the bill for every problem, yours or hers, while she doesn't even offer a penny in return. I'm sure her kids could use a public pool or see if their friends have one that they could use when visiting. Either way, that's not how bill-footing works. \n\nIf she asks again, and still refuses to reimburse you for the trampoline, tell her you're not her ATM machine.", "NTA, now if she would want to use child support to fix the pool that would be her business. But extra above what is court ordered is a judgment call by you. After all you get no credit from the courts for what you purchase for your kids to use in your home, and additional finacial support above what goes through the family court system is not applied to your court ordered support. That sounds heartless, but ultimately you may have a vindictive ex spouse. She could cause you hardship in family court, and so yes protect yourself. Understand that if you fall down for whatever reason you can't be there for your kids to \"lift them up\" and should you fall on hard times due to illness, loss of employment, traumatic life event ETC.. What then?", "yup!!!!  My grandma's pool is gated and been empty for several years now cause she dont wanna waste the money to fix it. \n\nMy neighbor has a gorgeous huge pool he rarely ever used!

If that's purely her house, than No - that's HER pool, her problem. If you're going to start paying for the upkeep of her house because your kids live there, then you should insist on a pro rata share of ownership in the house and property. Granted - a thousand dollars isn't much of a share of any house but, once you start paying for things, there's a good chance that suddenly she's going to need a roof, copper pipes, cabinets - because y'know - it's all for your boys - right?", "NTA\n\n> She said no because the trampoline was used everyday whereas her pool was used seasonally and therefore was normal wear and tear. \n\nI have literally no idea what this is supposed to mean.", "Well, she\u2019s just trying her luck.
