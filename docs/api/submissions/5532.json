Um tell her that your transmission went out and it's going to be $8K to get it replaced so if she could send you a grand or two it would be appreciated. Oh and remind her that it's the same vehicle you take your kids in to everywhere they need to go.\n\nBet that logic gets changed.", "Does she also expect you to pay part of her mortgage since the kids will be living there? She is somewhere between unreasonable and delusional to think you should pay any part of the pool repair cost. NTA", "NTA\n\nNobody needs a pool at their house, including 6, 9, and 12 year olds. If she can\u2019t afford the upkeep, it\u2019s not a necessary expense.", "NTA.  That\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants you to cover 20% of the cost then you should get to use the pool 20% of the time.\n\nIf this is an above ground pool - then her repair estimate is more than it's even worth.

That was a truly ridiculous request. If her car breaks down, do you pay to repair it, because she drives your kids around? If her oven dies, do you pay for that so she can feed your kids? It's the same ridiculous theory. She needs a reality check. Again, NTA. At all.", "NTA\n\nwhatever divorce agreement you have in place already takes into account all \"normal wear and tear\", all maintenance, all costs of the living arrangements for the kids.", "NTA. She owns the home, any and all repairs or upgrades are her responsibility. She just doesn\u2019t want to pay for all of it, and is trying to manipulate you into offsetting her costs.

She bought a house and a pool, she can pay for the upkeep.", "Nta, don't pay, if you do, you will be making a precedent, and she will write to you anytime something in her house broke, with the same excuse \"but is for the kids\"", "NTA. I understand why she's an ex.", "NTA. I mean, I\u2019m being deprived of having a pool because it costs around $90k including blasting out the limestone, won\u2019t someone think of me and give me that money?  \nThe fact that there are already \u201cN-A-H, but you are depriving them of a pool\u201d is so ridiculous that I wonder if anyone saying that could look another adult in the eyes and ask for that money without feeling like an idiot.

Do you also have to help with her home repairs, as your kids live there too? \\s", "NTA - You are not benefitting in any way for repairing and increasing the value on her house. Plenty of people don't have pools in their backyard and survive just fine without them during summer, I wager your children will as well.", "NTA and her logic is flawed.

Shared expenses should be 1)  clearly defined and 2) *shared* by the two of you.", "NTA. Her house, her problem.", "NTA This should be her expense alone, especially if you replaced the trampoline yourself.", "NTA. The audacity of this woman is staggering.", "NTA.

The distinction she\u2019s making applies to whether to expect payment in the case of warranties/insurance- it has nothing to do with who should pay as between the two of you (and you might even say \u201cI am not an insurance policy). Assuming the two of you expect to be roughly equals, you either both pay for things like this (though that might needlessly complicate things between you) or, the better/simpler option, you both pay for recreational equipment the kids use at your own damn house!", "NTH. They are her kids too. It's not like you will be using the pool at all. Her pool/property - her responsibility.", "NTA. Whatever arrangement you guys have also covers maintenance. Also I'm sure they could swim at the local pool for a fraction of the cost.", "NTA.", "NTA.  \nthat is her home and her home's infrastructure.

It is her responsibility to take care of it.", "NTA because she would not have honored the quid pro quo. \n\nOn another note, I would probably pitch in because in the end you would be doing it for your sons.\n\nThe ex sounds like a treat lmao.", "Did y\u2019all have an agreement beforehand about her having a pool for the kids?
