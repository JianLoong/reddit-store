A pool isn't a necessity, it's a luxury. You didn't tell her to have a pool in her house. If she can't pay for the upkeep then she needs to have the pool remove, your kids can always go to a community pool or a waterpark to satiate their need to swim. \n\nAlso, you don't benefit from the pool, you don't use it and it's not at your house so your property value doesn't go up either. What's the chance she's planning to sell her house in the near future and a pool in great shape means her house will sell for more, which again doesn't really benefit you since you won't see anything in return. \n\nTell her you're planning to have a pool in your house too for the kids and ask her if she's willing to contribute money to have it built or at least for the upkeep, since you know \"her\" kids will be using it too. Do you think she's going to say yes? \n\nShe's also grasping at straws trying to justify her reasoning for not reimbursing you for the trampoline. She says that you replacing the trampoline because it's being used everyday isn't normal wear and tear, unless your kids were intentionally damaging the trampoline, then that is considered wear and tear. Imagine, she needs to replace her old tires and she has a warranty for normal wear and tear but the dealership tells her since she uses the car everyday instead of occasionally, her tires aren't covered under the warranty. It also looks like your trampoline has more used than her pool. \n\nWhat's next? Your kids are also using a lot of the things in her house too, is she going to ask you to contribute some money on those things too if they need fixing or replacing?

If that $1000 would break the bank, then $0 should be spent on the pool.", "We haul dirt and do bobcat work, build pads, etc. We hauled a few loads of fill dirt to fill in a pool, then better screened dirt and compacted it to make it flat on top. Tested well for compaction, everything good. We charged much less than $10k for that. You should be able to find someone doing side work or small jobs in your area that can do it professionally and safely. Doesn't need to be a big company", "Empty the pool, dump some soil in the bottom, plastic tarp the top = greenhouse. Grow some food.", "I\u2019ve seen an amazing home office built out of a pool with a roof over it. So maybe?", "Fill it with sand, turn it into a beach.", "They do add value. Depending on your state, if you are in the states, will determine the value given. In CT it used to add about $8,000 to the value of your house, if it was an inground pool. No outdoor living space besides a pool added value in CT. I'm also going off old info, so it may have changed. Where I am in florida, outdoor living space adds value. A pool adds even more value.", "Exactly, which is not what she is requesting here. A house and a pool are majorly different", "Given that the ex-wife had enough money to buy a house with a pool on her own after the divorce, it's just as likely that she's paying child support to the OP.", "Given that the ex-wife had enough money to buy a house with a pool on her own after the divorce, it's just as likely that she's paying child support to the OP.", "Lol so she has money enough and shouldn't bother you. If my ex asked if I wanted to pay half for a swimming pool in his yard, I'd say yes, cause it's fun for the kids and I have no yard, but that's 100 euro for a swimming pool lol.", "My point is he\u2019s being petty and the only people losing here are the children.", "Many coparents do pay for those things. Many that don't have official child support agreements split costs like that. \n\nMy friend who is the parent who does all the extra curricular activities for the kids actually got help from her ex for a new car. I think they split it 50-50 and when he needed a new car she helped him with about 20% of it.", "I'm not saying he SHOULD. I'm saying, if it won't hurt him financially,  he could. He could just be the nice guy. Sheesh!", "This is a nice idea. There are also these lovely things called, \"covers\", that can be placed on top of the offending pool.

Help them have a pool?? This has nothing to do with children. This woman chose to purchase a home, she\u2019s solely responsible for the upkeep of this home, regardless if there\u2019s children or not.

Just because he doesn\u2019t fix HER pool means he\u2019s not a nice guy?", "You're saying he'd be the AH if he could and didn't so you are saying ge should.", "So OP needs to partially pay for something that\u2019s not his to begin with? \n\nWhere\u2019s the logic in that?", ">There are also these lovely things called, \"covers\", that can be placed on top of the offending pool.

We both love swimming and I have physical issues that make swimming virtually the only form of exercise I can do right now. It's low impact on joints and will be great to have as we get older. We're also both very much aware of the maintenance it will require and have had some experience with it previously. \n\nJust saying. Having an in-ground pool is a bad idea for many, but not for everyone.", "Maybe it depends on if she's strict about only the kids being able to use it.  \n\nI wonder if the house insurance would cover it considering it had also covered the pool.", "Good grief you're making a lot of assumptions about the future.", "Koi people are real weird, even to the rest of the fish keeping community.", "yep, and if you test the suitability of the pond with feeder goldfish, you might never get to koi, because the feeders do really well. Of course then your pond with be the morning meeting place for the neighborhood cats, who gather to watch the goldfish breed inthe shallows.", "Yeah, the big ones can cost a lot of koin", "Get the small ones and let them grow out.", "Or the free ones outside of some restaurants and hotels.\n\n^^/s", "Where I live the local mosquito and vector control will give you free mosquito fish if you have a pond or sitting water.

But we always had above ground pools that were taken down for winter (and the area turned into a skating rink).\n\nA friend of mine got a \u2018new-fang led \u2019 type of above ground pool, that is sunk a short way into the ground, and deck built around it so it\u2019s hard to tell it\u2019s not built in.  But it has the ease of repairs (just change the liner, which he hasn\u2019t had to do) and can get rid of it much more cheaply when he gets tired of caring for it.  This is what I plan on doing if we decide to go the pool route again.", "Yes, it's why I have a relationship (not **that** kind) with my plumbers ...", "Hahaha this is cute", "Went to high school with a Koi person. Can confirm.", "Probably because most koi people normally aren't fisherman. Koi are considered a prize possession in most of Asia and a few have actually sold for over a million dollars(crazy though lol). Luckily, my dad didn't have any funds like that and eventually quit he the koi club since he wasn't able to spend 1000s of dollars a year like the rest of the club could. Most were lawyers and doctors along with a few local upper government  officials.", "We commonly dropped feeder goldfish into our deeper water troughs to keep up with mosquitos on our farm.", "I've been thinking recently about moving to the east coast, New Hampshire or similar. It's so incredibly expensive here, what I paid in a down payment for my house could have bought me something equally as good in a less expensive area. \n\nMaybe with a pool : )"]}
