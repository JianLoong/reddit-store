I have not paid it back yet, and I\u2019m not sure if refusing would make me an asshole. \n\nContext of the bill (non-essential, but maybe helpful): I run cross country. In August, I was noticing my heart quadrupling its resting rate only minutes into running. After almost passing out during races, I spoke to my parents and we scheduled a doctor appointment. The doctor said I was likely just out of shape, but sent me to the hospital to do some blood and heart tests. My parents agreed that I was out of shape and thought it was a waste of time and money to go to the hospital. The results came back showing that I had an irregular heart rate. While this is reasonable in people with low resting rates, it could have hinted to why my heart was spiking, and the cardiologist wanted to do more tests. My mom, as she told me, did google research and determined that it was healthy and didn\u2019t follow through with any further visits. Given the reaction to the initial visits, I didn\u2019t mention my health after that. I don\u2019t believe it was due to being out of shape, because even running 3-5 miles daily for two months showed no improvement (despite my efforts to calm it, my situation even worsened to actually blacking out after races, which my parents knew but ignored). \n\nThe bill from my hospital visit was paid already, and my dad handed me the mailed copy a few days ago to pay back. It was $50 after insurance. \n\nContext of finances: My parents aren\u2019t rich, but this expense wouldn\u2019t hurt them. At worst, it means one fewer night eating out. Likewise, the payment wouldn\u2019t hurt me. It\u2019s more about principle. As I\u2019m working part-time and nearing adulthood, my parents are encouraging financial responsibility. I do not pay health insurance and have never been expected to pay anything medical before. I do pay my gas, car insurance, phone bill, and the occasional family groceries if I am sent to the store, as well as any school fees and personal expenses. My monthly \u201cbills\u201d are $200+. This month already, I have spent an extra $180 on AP tests and $150 on college applications. I don\u2019t mind these expenses, since they\u2019re mine and make me feel as though my earnings are being put to use, as well as preparing me for adulthood. However, the amount I cover tends to shock my peers (of similar financial standing), so I feel like I\u2019m already paying more than usually expected. \n\nWhy I haven\u2019t paid: I feel that my health situation wasn\u2019t handled well and the $50 for the initial tests was almost bare minimum. While I\u2019m usually fine to cover my expenses (as described), this one doesn\u2019t feel right given that my parents dismissed the results and I had to struggle with my health for months.\n\nI haven\u2019t paid it back yet, and it\u2019s a matter of time before I am confronted about it.

Would I be an asshole if I refuse when the time comes?", "created_utc": 1698981049, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mlkgl/aita_for_not_paying_a_hospital_bill/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
