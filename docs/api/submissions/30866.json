You are entitled to spend the holiday however you want it. I don't care for the remark about getting Venmo'ed cash. The adult thing would be to abstain from gifts, since you are not doing Christmas together.", "What do you want to do? If you want to go to Florida go for it. It sounds fun. Most people don't spend every holiday with their family after they get married. If your mom thinks nothing will change, it might be better to let her down sooner rather then later. If you spend Thanksgiving with her you should be able to get away for Christmas without any complaints. And if she wants to cause a big fuss she should be prepared to see even less of you.", "NTA. When you get married, it is natural to start doing things with your new nuclear family, starting your own traditions,  and visiting the inlaws is no longer the main event.   So your mom is spot on, you are \"separating yourself\" but it is normal. \n\nI give you a soft A H for \"just venmo me money\" as that comes off so tacky and that you don't want to hang out but you want the gift. Instead you could have offered to come over a week before or after to exchange gifts, otherwise how will you give them your gift?", ">She took it as Alexis driving a wedge and asked about what they were supposed to do present wise with us gone. I told her I'd be happy just getting Venmo'd cash and call that the present, which only made her more upset. \n\nNTA for wanting to do Florida with the wife, but YTA for asking for cash from your mom. It's tacky as hell. If you want mom to leave you alone, don't hit her up for money.", "NTA.  You are an adult, with a family of your own. You should take this time to enjoy yourselves while you are young and child free. Do make it clear that this was a joint decision and she should not hold it against your wife.", "NTA Im not gonna call you TA for wanting to go to Florida but it does rub me the wrong way how you asked for cash for Christmas. When asked about presents you only mention receiving which indicates you weren\u2019t giving a gift. If you\u2019re grown enough to be married and going to Florida you should definitely be buying gifts for the people you expect them from. And to say that you\u2019d just be happy to be Venmo\u2019d the cash was probably pretty insulting to your mom.", "NTA. At the end of the day it's your time to do with what you will. I don't understand why people put family Christmases up on this ridiculous pedestal. The best Christmas I ever had was just my best mate and I hanging out on our flat, eating rubbish, watching rubbish and getting tipsy and having a laugh. \n\nMaybe you can suggest they join you in Florida next year if you have a good time this year?", "NTA. Your mom needs to get used to the idea that you have now your own family and not all holiday celebrations will be together. What should they do with the presents - mail them or have them delivered directly at your house when they know you are back. Do you hate spending time with them - no, but you want to spend time on your own as well and as a young family they should understand this. \n\nYour mom is not your priority anymore and congrats to getting the right message. It doesn't mean you guys can't visit them after you are back from Florida or send them a Christmas card from there to show you still think about them.", "ESH", "NTA, but Alexis is definitely driving a wedge and it\u2019s 100% rude of you to ask for cash in this context.", "NTA: You are grown adults who deserve to do what you want on the holidays", "I'm not judging.\n\nBut I will say this, there's going to be a time when the thing you wish for more than anything else in the whole wide world is just one more boring Christmas with mom and dad.", "NTA", "I\u2019m going with NAH. You have the right to spend holiday time with your spouse and make your own family traditions. However that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t hurt the family members you leave behind. Which means you will be TA if you don\u2019t handle things carefully. And if you\u2019re a jerk with your family about this. \n\nMake sure you carve out enough time to spend with your family either around that time of year. Maybe spend New Years with them. Or prioritize other holidays. You don\u2019t spend Christmas but maybe Thanksgiving you spend with them. Maybe make time for your mom\u2019s birthday. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to alienate your family and that\u2019s easy to do as a young couple. You need to do some goodwill visits and make some goodwill gestures so you aren\u2019t seen as selfish family members who don\u2019t really care about your other family members. \n\nBecause you may not realize it but time only gets faster now. Don\u2019t take for granted that your family will always be there. When I was younger I could be cavalier about these visits. I did put in the time but I could have put in more time. And now a lot of those relatives are gone. And you can\u2019t get that time back.", "Where is your wife's family in all this? I assume they're unavailable to spend Christmas with? Given it's fairly common to swap back and forth from one year to the next, then this year is her year and without her family being an option you've instead chosen Florida (the one state crazier than most family gatherings \ud83d\ude1c). Nothing wrong with that. It's true you could have floated the idea a little more gently perhaps, but that's with the benefit of hindsight. Perhaps suggest a dinner for when you get back? Not as formal as an actual holiday meal, but still a chance for family to get together and talk about the neighbours for a reasonable amount of time. Anyway, NTA, you and your mom are going through the growing pains of you spreading your wings and her having to let go. Good luck!", "Nta. Book the trip and ignore your mom\u2019s guilttripping.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you should flat out say you find Christmas with your mom boring straight to her face, but I would frame it as you\u2019re excited to be starting your own family and with that you\u2019re creating new traditions with your wife. Make it clear that this is a joint decision and that it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s decision/idea that you\u2019re just following.\n\nMy husband and I choose to alternate most holidays with family but have made it clear that they don\u2019t own these holidays and sometimes we will choose to have a trip instead or just stay home with our own traditions.", "NTA. Leave and cleave, baby. You and your wife have created your own family now. It is time to create your own family traditions. Maybe that will be Florida every christmas. Maybe it'll be somewhere different every year. Maybe it'll be sitting home in your jammies, watching cheesy movies and drinking wine. Whatever you do, as long as you and your wife agree, enjoy it. Life is too short to live it for other people.", "NTA. You are young and newly married.  This happens, in some form, in basically 99% of marriages - you have to figure out holidays!  You could be wanting to spend them with her family or whatever.  So, there's nothing particularly unusual about that.  However, going from we're pretty committed to going to the beach to \"you both hate spending time with us\" is quite the leap!\n\nHonestly, it would be good to consider marking it as \"new tradition\" territory.  Like, if you decide that it's not worth the drama (for next year), you could say something like, \"I'd like to introduce a new tradition where we <fill in thing> on Christmas.\"  That could be try a new board game, volunteer at a food pantry, whatever.  The point is, if boredom is the problem, fill it with SOMETHING!  That might help mend hurt feelings... but your folks also seem a bit like they still think of you as a kid.  Sorry, that's part of marrying young some times.", "NTA, but your mom is right. You do hate spending time with them.  There are millions of ways to make gatherings more interesting. You're choosing to cut and run, and that's fine, but don't expect your mom to see it as anything other than you abandoning them. Do you visit much other than the holidays?", "YTA, based on your replies to comments more than anything, you come across as extremely selfish. \"Oh no my parents love me and actually want to spend time with me\" must be awful that. \n\nOne day you'll mature and you will end up regretting not spending the time they have left with them, I can guarantee you that.", "Just Venmo me money mommy!!! Bro Yta.", "NTA. Christmas with family is stressful and it's completely okay to want to spend it alone with your wife. Especially if you're already seeing your parents for Thanksgiving. Your wife sounds hella cool.", "Info: What do you wanna do?", "You separated yourself from your family when you *got married*.\n\nYou now have your own family unit and wife is your #1. Mom can kick rocks.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be rude about it, but \u201cmy wife and I are choosing to celebrate Christmas this year with a trip, so we won\u2019t be available\u201d should be good enough.", "It sounds like there\u2019s tension between your wife and your mom. Your wife is the first to try and get out of family holidays, and your mom instantly blames her for the issue. NTA do whatever you wanna do", "NTA. You\u2019ll have to start making your own Christmas traditions at some point anyway.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is so dramatic. \n\nEnjoy Florida!", "YTA\n\nyour parents probably have less than 20 Christmas' left.\n\nas you age there will be fewer opportunities so you probably only have like 10-15 christmas' with your parents even possible.\n\nI realized last year that I likely have less than 10 visits total with my parents left.\n\nyou might not care, but they're counting down", "NTA get the trip booked and if you don\u2019t like it, try somewhere else next year. I\u2019m fed up of seeing posts like this where parents expect their children to go to their houses at Christmas after they have left home, then playing the guilt card when they want to do their own thing. Kids are not possessions.

My wife and I have to factor in her family and create our own traditions. This year we\u2019ll be doing something different on the actual holiday. We can celebrate Christmas together on X day if you\u2019d like to celebrate, early or late. Otherwise, you are welcome to celebrate without us.\u201d", "First off, congratulations on your wedding!!! May you have a long and happy married life. \n\nNow, to your situation. It sounds to me like neither one of you really wants to go to your mother's house for the holidays which is totally understandable, however, your mother also sounds like the kind of person to hold grudges for years about these minor little details. This will absolutely put a strain on your relationship with her vs. your wife since your mom is going to blame it all on your new wife. As the husband, it is your responsibility to set and enforce boundaries between your relationship with your wife and your mother. \n\nSo how about a compromise? Have Christmas with your family a few days before Christmas. Tell her you really want to have this experience for this year as this is something you had never done before. Emphasis thay it isn't because you don't want to be with the family, it's because you want to try something new for the holidays and emphasis that YOU want to go on this trip. She will most definitely try and paint your wife in a bad light. \n\nAlso, I recommend recording the conversation in case she tries to bad mouth you or your wife or tries to gaslight you afterward. I'm not saying that she is the type of person to do these types of things, but it never hurts to have evidence in case things really do go sideways and you are put in a position where you need to defend yourselves. \n\nYou are newly married, and your mom is probably having a hard time accepting that her baby boy is all grown up and is off building a life and family of his own. It doesn't sound like she is narcissistic or abusive, just a mother having a hard time adjusting to the new change. With time, she will learn to accept it. However, the guilt tripping is a big no-no. Put a stop to it now before it begins to drive a wedge through your marriage and start polishing your backbone. Keep it shiny, for you will never know when you will need it. \n\nAs a side note: women find men who can set and enforce boundaries incredibly attractive, so this will win you extra husband points as well.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. You are an adult. You don\u2019t have to spend every holiday with your family and your mom is going to have to learn to accept that. Especially, if you don\u2019t live in the same town as them. Also have you spent any holidays with your wife\u2019s family? Most couples rotate.\n\nYou were right to be honest with your mom about why you don\u2019t enjoy coming over for holidays. It\u2019s exactly the same at my mom\u2019s. I\u2019ve been honest with her about it. We\u2019ve also started adding in other plans. Playing card/board games. Going to a movie or somewhere else. Also, we get a hotel room for several reasons, but one is if we want to hit up a bar for a few drinks after they go to bed, we can and not have my mom waiting up for us (seriously I\u2019m 40 and she would, also she doesn\u2019t drink). My mom still makes me feel bad about getting a hotel, but I\u2019m always happier when we do. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m going to call you out on one error. Don\u2019t expect gifts from your parents as an adult.
