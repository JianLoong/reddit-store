Older sister is Kate (29f) then me (27f) and then our younger sister Amy (26f). Kate and I had a good relationship as kids and so did Amy and I. But Kate always disliked Amy. I believe part of the reason is she felt embarrassed of Amy's speech issues. Amy has had trouble with her speech since she was a child. Some sounds she cannot make the same, some she is trying but they come out differently than others would say them. Her own name is actually an example. She says it like am-e instead of aim-e when we always said it as aim-e. She did speech therapy as a kid and she had an IEP in school but her speech issues never fully went away. This was always something Kate hated and she hated hearing Amy talk. I always told Kate it wasn't Amy's fault but Kate was just never fond of Amy. I don't want to say she hates Amy but it sure did seem that way at times.\n\nKate had her first baby a few weeks ago and Amy has a very difficult time saying her name. It doesn't sound the same when she says it but clearly she is trying and I know she's self-conscious of it so she tries not to say the name. She told me it's not like she will be allowed to be much of an aunt anyway since Kate never liked her.\n\nWe were at our parents house over the weekend and at some point Amy said our niece's name. Kate got super pissed off with her that she didn't say it right. She told her it was why she never liked her, she was always rude and couldn't even put the effort into saying names right and how glad she is she won't be around her daughter much to influence her. And who knows, maybe she just won't know who she is at all. She would be happier that way. Amy was so upset and I was so mad at Kate. I told her she is such a bully to Amy and she knows Amy isn't intentionally saying the name wrong, she can't help it. I told her she should be more understanding and less of a bully.\n\nKate could not believe I was so harsh she also couldn't believe I would side with Amy over her.\n\nI don't feel bad for defending Amy but maybe I went too far? Kate said so. She told me she would never have called me a bully, no matter what, and that I had chosen a side which was wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681846702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r1km9/aita_for_calling_my_older_sister_a_bully_and/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't help it any more than your younger sister can help her speech impediment. Your older sister is a bully. Good for you for standing up to her.", "NTA.  What you did wasn\u2019t even harsh - it was the truth. And if she thinks it\u2019s harsh, then what she has been doing to Amy for decades is infinitely harsher. And here\u2019s some actual harsh truth - Kate is not a kind soul. She is narrow hearted, and quite frankly, anybody who treats their younger sister like that for their entire life lacks what it takes to be a really open hearted and generous mother. If I found out my mother not only treated my aunt this way, but thought lesser of them - so much lesser that they thought they weren\u2019t worth meeting their child - I would be mortified. Just so disappointed that I had such a cruel person as a mother.  In many ways, having a child is a chance to become a better person - but Kate chose to dig down and become a worse person. I hope she is treated in life exactly the way that she treats Amy. \n\nKate is trying to gaslight you - she would have never called you a bully because you never did anything that was considered bullying. But she did. Why is she conflating your behaviour with hers, when they are so very different? And why does it matter what Kate thinks?  Clearly she is biased, and she is a cruel cruel person.

She definitely enjoyed her little rant and the impact it had on Amy, and that makes her a bully.\n\nIt always stuns me that bullies get so sensitive when you call them out for being bullies.

That is something that could spark of a jealousy early between young children.

It sounds like she's always treated her with resentment. Which probably doesn't help Amy's nerves around her either.\n\nA few things you mentioned - \"never liked her\", \"couldn't put in the effort to say names right\" \"always rude\", the suggestion of Amy's \"influencing\" her daughter - rather lean towards Kate having balled up so much resentment towards Amy that she's kinda convinced herself that Amy's doing it for attention, or won't try, and that she could \"influence\" her daughter into a speech impediment. Which in itself suggests she sees it almost like an affectation.\n\nIt sounds like Kate's been an absolute wagon to poor Amy all her life tbh. And I'm pretty sure the least helpful thing in resolving a speech impediment is bullying the person about it. It's not impossible that Kate's treatment and any bullying she influenced in other kids growing up is part of why she's still struggling with it.\n\nNTA as far as you went anyway. Bit of \"lady doth protest\" regarding the word \"bullying\". Ofc she's a bully to her sister and she knows it, as much as she won't admit it.\n\nYou could stand to give Amy more support though.

So if I had to make a guess answer at your \"why does Kate feel comfortable making this comment in front of OP\" question, it would be that Kate isn't used to facing consequences for this behavior pattern that's been in place since all three were children. \n\nNow OP *has* presented consequences (getting called out for bullying).
