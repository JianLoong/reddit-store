Older sister is Kate (29f) then me (27f) and then our younger sister Amy (26f). Kate and I had a good relationship as kids and so did Amy and I. But Kate always disliked Amy. I believe part of the reason is she felt embarrassed of Amy's speech issues. Amy has had trouble with her speech since she was a child. Some sounds she cannot make the same, some she is trying but they come out differently than others would say them. Her own name is actually an example. She says it like am-e instead of aim-e when we always said it as aim-e. She did speech therapy as a kid and she had an IEP in school but her speech issues never fully went away. This was always something Kate hated and she hated hearing Amy talk. I always told Kate it wasn't Amy's fault but Kate was just never fond of Amy. I don't want to say she hates Amy but it sure did seem that way at times.\n\nKate had her first baby a few weeks ago and Amy has a very difficult time saying her name. It doesn't sound the same when she says it but clearly she is trying and I know she's self-conscious of it so she tries not to say the name. She told me it's not like she will be allowed to be much of an aunt anyway since Kate never liked her.\n\nWe were at our parents house over the weekend and at some point Amy said our niece's name. Kate got super pissed off with her that she didn't say it right. She told her it was why she never liked her, she was always rude and couldn't even put the effort into saying names right and how glad she is she won't be around her daughter much to influence her. And who knows, maybe she just won't know who she is at all. She would be happier that way. Amy was so upset and I was so mad at Kate. I told her she is such a bully to Amy and she knows Amy isn't intentionally saying the name wrong, she can't help it. I told her she should be more understanding and less of a bully.\n\nKate could not believe I was so harsh she also couldn't believe I would side with Amy over her.\n\nI don't feel bad for defending Amy but maybe I went too far? Kate said so. She told me she would never have called me a bully, no matter what, and that I had chosen a side which was wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681846702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r1km9/aita_for_calling_my_older_sister_a_bully_and/", "score": 732, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't help it any more than your younger sister can help her speech impediment. Your older sister is a bully. Good for you for standing up to her.", "NTA.  What you did wasn\u2019t even harsh - it was the truth. And if she thinks it\u2019s harsh, then what she has been doing to Amy for decades is infinitely harsher. And here\u2019s some actual harsh truth - Kate is not a kind soul. She is narrow hearted, and quite frankly, anybody who treats their younger sister like that for their entire life lacks what it takes to be a really open hearted and generous mother. If I found out my mother not only treated my aunt this way, but thought lesser of them - so much lesser that they thought they weren\u2019t worth meeting their child - I would be mortified. Just so disappointed that I had such a cruel person as a mother.  In many ways, having a child is a chance to become a better person - but Kate chose to dig down and become a worse person. I hope she is treated in life exactly the way that she treats Amy. \n\nKate is trying to gaslight you - she would have never called you a bully because you never did anything that was considered bullying. But she did. Why is she conflating your behaviour with hers, when they are so very different? And why does it matter what Kate thinks?  Clearly she is biased, and she is a cruel cruel person.

She definitely enjoyed her little rant and the impact it had on Amy, and that makes her a bully.\n\nIt always stuns me that bullies get so sensitive when you call them out for being bullies.

That is something that could spark of a jealousy early between young children.

It sounds like she's always treated her with resentment. Which probably doesn't help Amy's nerves around her either.\n\nA few things you mentioned - \"never liked her\", \"couldn't put in the effort to say names right\" \"always rude\", the suggestion of Amy's \"influencing\" her daughter - rather lean towards Kate having balled up so much resentment towards Amy that she's kinda convinced herself that Amy's doing it for attention, or won't try, and that she could \"influence\" her daughter into a speech impediment. Which in itself suggests she sees it almost like an affectation.\n\nIt sounds like Kate's been an absolute wagon to poor Amy all her life tbh. And I'm pretty sure the least helpful thing in resolving a speech impediment is bullying the person about it. It's not impossible that Kate's treatment and any bullying she influenced in other kids growing up is part of why she's still struggling with it.\n\nNTA as far as you went anyway. Bit of \"lady doth protest\" regarding the word \"bullying\". Ofc she's a bully to her sister and she knows it, as much as she won't admit it.\n\nYou could stand to give Amy more support though.

But she could say A's! Since then every baby was called A. I was A's momma, I used to be baby's baby. I miss her.", "I have an English accent which also uses non-rhotic Rs and can say Aurora fine - because the Rs are sandwiched between two vowels you *have* to pronounce them. I drop the R from the end of words like year, roar, finger (ye-ah, raw, fing-ah) and I miss them in the middle of words like part (paht) or yard (yahd), but I definitely pronounce them in Aurora and other words where the R is surrounded by vowels like barrier (the last one gets dropped but the middle ones survive!) or parrot.", "I\u2019m not from New England so I\u2019m curious - what do they pronounce Rs as?", "I grew up in NE and can hear the Rs as AHs \ud83d\ude06 Thank you for the laugh!", "Or guilt on the parents part? If Kate always hated Amy since they were children.. there\u2019s probably something deeper going on. \n\nKate was 2 when OP was born, and then 4 when Amy was born. At some point it became apparent that Amy had speech issues and needed additional help/attention. It could very well be that Kate never felt like she got enough attention from her parents, and the parents felt guilt for having to give more attention to Amy. \n\nFrom one middle to another- NTA. Kate is an adult, and sounds like she needed / needs to be put in her place.", "With Kate being the oldest, it's certainly not unlikely. Especially if she was also the first grandchild in the family.", "That's a good thought", "I was going to say OP didn\u2019t go far enough and just walk out then and there with Amy.", "Am I the only one wondering where the parents where all this time? Why was it up for OP to explain stuff like that to her older sister? OP sounds like she has always sided with Amy. Going LC or NC is pretty much impossible when you all still live together.", "It is possible that there are genetic factors that contributed to Kate's speech impairment.\n\nBut you don't even have to be born with a speech impairment to develop one later in life. You could have a seizure that will affect your speech, or a brain injury.\n\nIt sounds like OP's sister has an articulation disorder, which, you are usually born with. You  can develop an articulation disorder as a kid by having difficulty hearing, or having motor planning issues. Dyslexia is also highly co-morbid with speech sound disorders.", "Unfortunately people having their own kids with disabilities doesn't make them better or more understanding. It often just means they are shitty parents to disabled kids. I think my SIL has become more of an asshole with disabled kids. She shows them no grace and she beats them. She just had her first bio kid recently. She'd always blamed my niece and nephews \"issues\" as being a fault of how their mother raised their kids. Their \"issues\" are that they are autistic and the other has ADHD so not the fault of how biomom raised them at all. She did IVF and finally had her own child so she could show everyone how much better of a mother she is than my brother's first wife. She wanted a perfect child to show off to people. \n\nBut God has a sense of humor and gave her the most obviously disabled baby. Head is misshapen. Developmentally not hitting any milestones. At 1 year old not crawling or walking or even able to turn over. The baby doesn't cry but it also doesn't make any noises. I feel bad for my new niece of course. \n\nBut God works in mysterious ways. And if he is a good God, he's gonna leave that poor kid an  unconscious potato so she never comprehends the monster who birthed her", "I disagree. Let\u2019s all hope for some slight cosmetic blemish that would make Kate melt down, since she\u2019s so fucking perfect. \n\nSlight, as in a barely visible overbite or a benign mole on a butt cheek.", "Bot.", "Kate sounds like one of those mean girls whose meanness stems from a great deal of personal insecurity combined with the need to control everything around her.", "Rory is another one I struggle to say with confidence.", "So typically R's are dropped with the accent. You don't Park your car in Harvard Yard in Boston you Pahk the cah in Havahd Yahd.  \n\nTo me having to say the r sound in Aurora is tedious because I really have to think about moving my mouth to make the R sound when I don't do it regularly. Ah-Roar-Ah. I feel like it takes me three times longer to say that three syllable name with those important R's  than it would to say something easier like Victoria that has four syllables.", "Where are your parents? Why was this not addressed sooner", "Why so this blemish of human society can bully children, too?", "Interesting! Thanks for the detailed explanation", "Bot.", "My bad. Didn\u2019t think with this light level of imperfection I\u2019d still have to throw in the */s*", "What Im saying is the woman is so horrible shed still bully the kid of a birthmark on the ass cheek", "is it really mean though? Because I don't think i really said anything that made sense anyways"]}
