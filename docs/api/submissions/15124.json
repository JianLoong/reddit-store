Older sister is Kate (29f) then me (27f) and then our younger sister Amy (26f). Kate and I had a good relationship as kids and so did Amy and I. But Kate always disliked Amy. I believe part of the reason is she felt embarrassed of Amy's speech issues. Amy has had trouble with her speech since she was a child. Some sounds she cannot make the same, some she is trying but they come out differently than others would say them. Her own name is actually an example. She says it like am-e instead of aim-e when we always said it as aim-e. She did speech therapy as a kid and she had an IEP in school but her speech issues never fully went away. This was always something Kate hated and she hated hearing Amy talk. I always told Kate it wasn't Amy's fault but Kate was just never fond of Amy. I don't want to say she hates Amy but it sure did seem that way at times.\n\nKate had her first baby a few weeks ago and Amy has a very difficult time saying her name. It doesn't sound the same when she says it but clearly she is trying and I know she's self-conscious of it so she tries not to say the name. She told me it's not like she will be allowed to be much of an aunt anyway since Kate never liked her.\n\nWe were at our parents house over the weekend and at some point Amy said our niece's name. Kate got super pissed off with her that she didn't say it right. She told her it was why she never liked her, she was always rude and couldn't even put the effort into saying names right and how glad she is she won't be around her daughter much to influence her. And who knows, maybe she just won't know who she is at all. She would be happier that way. Amy was so upset and I was so mad at Kate. I told her she is such a bully to Amy and she knows Amy isn't intentionally saying the name wrong, she can't help it. I told her she should be more understanding and less of a bully.\n\nKate could not believe I was so harsh she also couldn't believe I would side with Amy over her.\n\nI don't feel bad for defending Amy but maybe I went too far? Kate said so. She told me she would never have called me a bully, no matter what, and that I had chosen a side which was wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681846702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r1km9/aita_for_calling_my_older_sister_a_bully_and/", "score": 2898, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't help it any more than your younger sister can help her speech impediment. Your older sister is a bully. Good for you for standing up to her.", "NTA.  What you did wasn\u2019t even harsh - it was the truth. And if she thinks it\u2019s harsh, then what she has been doing to Amy for decades is infinitely harsher. And here\u2019s some actual harsh truth - Kate is not a kind soul. She is narrow hearted, and quite frankly, anybody who treats their younger sister like that for their entire life lacks what it takes to be a really open hearted and generous mother. If I found out my mother not only treated my aunt this way, but thought lesser of them - so much lesser that they thought they weren\u2019t worth meeting their child - I would be mortified. Just so disappointed that I had such a cruel person as a mother.  In many ways, having a child is a chance to become a better person - but Kate chose to dig down and become a worse person. I hope she is treated in life exactly the way that she treats Amy. \n\nKate is trying to gaslight you - she would have never called you a bully because you never did anything that was considered bullying. But she did. Why is she conflating your behaviour with hers, when they are so very different? And why does it matter what Kate thinks?  Clearly she is biased, and she is a cruel cruel person.

She definitely enjoyed her little rant and the impact it had on Amy, and that makes her a bully.\n\nIt always stuns me that bullies get so sensitive when you call them out for being bullies.

That is something that could spark of a jealousy early between young children.

It sounds like she's always treated her with resentment. Which probably doesn't help Amy's nerves around her either.\n\nA few things you mentioned - \"never liked her\", \"couldn't put in the effort to say names right\" \"always rude\", the suggestion of Amy's \"influencing\" her daughter - rather lean towards Kate having balled up so much resentment towards Amy that she's kinda convinced herself that Amy's doing it for attention, or won't try, and that she could \"influence\" her daughter into a speech impediment. Which in itself suggests she sees it almost like an affectation.\n\nIt sounds like Kate's been an absolute wagon to poor Amy all her life tbh. And I'm pretty sure the least helpful thing in resolving a speech impediment is bullying the person about it. It's not impossible that Kate's treatment and any bullying she influenced in other kids growing up is part of why she's still struggling with it.\n\nNTA as far as you went anyway. Bit of \"lady doth protest\" regarding the word \"bullying\". Ofc she's a bully to her sister and she knows it, as much as she won't admit it.\n\nYou could stand to give Amy more support though.

Not dementia, just a miserable old shit that didn't like someone finally putting their foot down and setting boundaries.", "The way that Kate was surprised that OP called her a bully makes it seem like she was used to OP being by her side and allowing Kate\u2019s bullying. Bullying could be put to a stop and put an end as it started. It seem like Kate is used to this behaviors and treated Amy that way is deeply imbedded in her because the family encouraged it. OP and Amy\u2019s parents should have slapped that behavior out of her from the beginning", "It seem like OP started to distance herself from Amy as kids when the bullying started and she encouraged it", "No one puts Corner in a corner", "I have a family nickname 'Taff' because when I was a toddler I couldn't say the K, th, or r sounds in Kathryn, and would introduce myself as Taffyn, which my sister shortened to Taff.", "I have a college friend named Christopher but we never called him that; when he was younger he had a baby cousin who could only say \u201cKiefer\u201d and the name stuck. Granted we were a bunch of massive stoners when we all met, so Bob\u2019s your uncle, but he never had a problem with it at all.", "I am glad someone else said this. It was like Kate\u2019s behavior was normalized. Amy must have been hurt so bad that her sister did not stand up for her", "[removed]", "Right? OP is in my eyes not much better than Kate. Sure she doesn\u2019t hate Amy or treat her like dirt herself, but she\u2019s clearly been a passive bystander for their whole lives in the sense that she still seems close and loving towards Kate. How can OP get themselves to even like a person who bullies their younger sister for a disability, even if that person is also a sister? I would be furious just by being near Kate. Grow a spine OP, stand up for Amy\u2019s sake and go low or no contact, otherwise you are just as pathetic as bystanders to people harassing others in school or similar places. Is that the worth you see in Amy? Not even being someone to choose when the behavior dictates it so? \nGlad you finally did something but it still reads as rather spineless. ESH except Amy, my hope is she has people in her life who actually doesn\u2019t tolerate poor treatment of her even once.", "i have a cousin named kyle on the very rural alabama side of the family. it's kind of a running joke between me and my mom his name isn't really \"kyle\" it's \"KAIyuh\"", "I can't even imagine how it would be physically possible to make the Rs non-rhotic in Aurora - you'd have to use a glottlestop between syllables. Au'o'a. Or just blur all the vowels together and make it sound like aaauuugh lol.", "Kathryn is a beautiful name but I actually love Taffyn! Bet you were adorable.", "Why?  Is it a round room?\n\nI once heard a teacher describe a kid as so dumb you could distract him for hours by sticking him in a round room and telling him to go stand in the corner.", "I had a friend whose brother was named Kristoffer (Norwegian version of Christopher)\n\nShe was younger than him and couldn't say his name when she was little and called him Tisstoffer. Which is hilarious because tiss means pee and penis in Norwegian. And still nobody was upset. Like. She wasn't insulting him on purpose so it was just quite cute."]}
