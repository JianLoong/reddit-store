{"id": 12642, "submission_id": "11v7r6b", "title": "AITA For telling a customer that \"I just work here\"", "selftext": "I just started a job as a receptionist at a doctor's office. When checking in a patient we have to confirm contact info, make sure their patient info is less than three years old, take copays, and take a scan of their insurance cards at the start of the new year.\n\nA customer came in and I started going through the list of things I had to do before he could be seen he kept getting increasingly annoyed as I went down the list. He told me \"I'm here every six months this is so stupid\". I just said \"it's office policy\" scanned his insurance cards and handed him the paperwork for him to fill out as his patient information was now three years old. I did the whole \"just fill this out and bring it up when you're done and you'll be good to go\" He huffed and snatched the clipboard from me and sat down.\n\nWhen he finished he brought up the clipboard and threw it on the counter and told me \"here's your stupid paperwork. Everything is the same as it's been for years, so it's dumb as sh\\*t that you need this.\" While I was picking up the paperwork I said \"sir I just work here. I'm just doing my job\" He got mad and told me I was being disrespectful and shouldn't be working the front desk if I was going to act like a b\\*tch. I told him \"the doctor will be with you shortly\" and put the paperwork on the doctor's station. He went and sat down but was glaring at me the entire time he waited.\n\nMy coworkers don't think I did anything wrong, but I've never been so blunt with someone while I was at work.

You weren\u2019t rude to him and kept calm. He bombarded you with shit attitude and you were neutral in response. You don\u2019t have to smile and be the best friend of every asshole that approaches your desk. You have to be professional and you were c: good job OP I would definitely give my boss a reason to fire me after that one x)", "NTA. The patient called you a bitch and threw the clipboard at you? What a nasty, misogynistic AH, he has no right to abuse clinic staff. He should be offloaded from the patient list.", "NTA. How does someone who just cursed at you have the audacity to call YOU disrespectful?!", "NTA. My wife used to work patient access similar to OP. A patient literally told her he would kill her if she mispronounced his name. Y\u2019all are just trying to do your job, there\u2019s no reason for people to make it unnecessarily more difficult.", "Conduct like that typically gets patients the boot. I'd have a word with the doctor about this. NTA", "NTA this is how all office are. I\u2019d would have told the doctor about the encounter if you work for a private practice. The doctor should drop him as a patient if he is going to act that way towards the staff.", "NTA. You did your job commendably", "NTA but the guy was. You were professional and nice, even when he was completely disrespectful to you. There is no excuse for that behavior. I would report him to upper management and then he would be potentially be dropped by the Dr's office (or maybe not). But I would hope someone from upper management or even his doctor would speak to him and tell him that behavior will not be tolerated.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s pretty standard procedure which if he\u2019s a regular he would know. \n\nAnyway, would it help if you mentioned it to the dr.? \nI would like to think the dr doesn\u2019t want him talking to his staff the way he did.", "NTA. Dudes probably emotional because of some issue, but you can\u2019t NOT do your job because someone\u2019s angry.", "Nta. The minute he swore I would have kicked him out.

Not your fault he doesn't know how insurance works.", "Nta\u2026 I\u2019ve worked medical registration since 2014 I have had same thing happen to me multiple times", "NTA.

Exact same fucking training.", "I am able to put notes in files for future reference. Maybe I should do that next time I work", "Be careful. You may violate some HIPAA  policy if you retrieve his file without need.\n\nYou may be better off talking to the doctor about his behavior towards you", "Minimum information may be accessed if needed for treatment, payment, or operations.  Taking note of a rude patient, IMO, falls under \u201coperations.\u201d \n\nIn addition, a payer often will not let you discharge a patient without cause, and starting the paper trail immediately, instead of waiting until things are intolerable, could help in the future."]}
