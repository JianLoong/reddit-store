There is a whole process with official documentation and sometimes a list of other places they can go for care.", "Ah Reddit, where anytime someone is acting like a jerk, there\u2019s someone who tries to find a disability to blame for it instead.", "The above comment was paraphrased from here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v7r6b/comment/jcrvp4l/\n\nI know it\u2019s not definitive by itself, but the rest of the account\u2019s comments elsewhere are also stolen/paraphrased.", "It\u2019s really hard to fire a patient at a lot of places. I\u2019ve never worked anywhere where calling someone a bitch once without violence would get someone fired, but maybe it\u2019s easier at a small private practice rather than a hospital/academic based clinic", "You can write a note fellow staff or put a warning on the chart without it showing up in the legal record. You can also make medical notes inaccessible to patients, but they might know there is a note they can\u2019t read.", "No that kind of a note absolutely would show up when the patient requests their medical records. They get EVERYTHING that is attached to their file. *Everything*. It would be very illegal to withhold that information once it's in the chart.", "Corporations will usually require yearly retraining even if it is not federally mandated; I have to do biennial HIPAA retraining for my CPhT certification to renew but my employer requires it every year for liability reasons.", "NTA.  Some people just do not get that front-office staff doesn't get to make the rules, so complaining to them about the rules is pointless.  They can only follow the rules they are given or quit their job.", "NTA. My doctor\u2019s office has signs saying what will happen to patients who are abusive to staff. Sounds like your office needs one of those", "NTA. I have paperwork I am only supposed to have to do it once a year. It ends up being every time I go. I go frequently. I do the paperwork because it\u2019s not the receptionist fault why I am always having to do it. It prompts her so she prints it. There\u2019s also times I will be in 3 days in a row, I still do it. And they\u2019re only supposed to do my weight every so often, but the specialists nurses doesn\u2019t check when last done. I do that as well with complaint. You are just doing your job. He needs to be kicked out of the clinic for how he treated you!", "Nta but report his behavior any time he speaks to you that way. Then he'll be dropped as a patient if he's continuously hostile. You have a right to a work place where you don't get demeaned or have people yell at you for doing exactly your job.", "NTA, but the client? Total AH.", "NTA. Don't respond to people like this with any form of kindness, otherwise they'll continue to act like this and get even worse. Just be curt, say the bare minimum, and don't even make eye contact. There are other jobs out there.", "NTA!!!!\n\nI work in a similar environment and patients are constantly whining and complaining about things that I have zero control over.  We don\u2019t set policy, we have to comply with HIPAA standards, and I\u2019ve had patients throw clipboards, paperwork, writing utensils, and hand sanitizer at me.  I feel like the only way for you to react professionally to that type of behavior is to calmly reiterate that you are just doing your job.  Like, the cashier at the grocery store has no control over the price of avocados, SIR.  We are all just doing our jobs ffs.", "NTA. The customer was a selfish boob looking for someone to vent on, and never considered that you weren\u2019t the one making the rules.\n\nSome folks just lack basic empathy. Sadly, anyone in your position has to deal with them. I am truly sorry.\n\nAnd the rest of us wonder why customer service is so bad in this country. It\u2019s AH\u2019s like this guy who convince folks in your position to give up, and ruin everything for everyone else.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.  My dr's office worker usually asks for that every year because the insurance could be changed, so I complied and provided the insurance cards which are usually renew every year with different ID numbers for some security reason I think.  \n\nYou may want to talk to your boss and see if they can implement the rules or policy, if the patients are rude, they're shown the door.  Some do for their safety reasons and some don't.", "He\u2019s the asshole. Is this really even a question?", "Did the doctor successfully remove the stick from his ass? \n\nNTA", "Nta. You should have told the doctor or office manager about his attitude.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not allowed to be rude to a patient. You are allowed to be firm.", "I have seen large stickers around a doctors offices receptions before that read 'If you are rude to staff you will be asked to leave'. That patient was being a dick. Next time a patient makes a fuss about that you go 'If you don't want to comply then we can stop here and you can find a different office.'", "NTA, it\u2019s your job.  It is annoying for the patient to have to fill out paperwork, many times when they are given very little time to do it.  I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve complained about having to do this and wish the doctor would go to an electronic paperwork system.  But my complaint was no where near the attitude this patient gave.  There\u2019s no excuse for that.", "Quite a few physicians  offices I call have a voice message saying verbal  abuse will not be tolerated.\nI s a patient threw a clipboard at my desk and called me a bitch, I'd be speaking to his doctor about this", "The same presentation every year. I can just about recite it", "\u201cAnd he verbally assaulted OP at her job, calling her a B\\*\\*\\*\\*. Is there not some type of legal accountability for people who can't conduct themselves with basic civility?\u201d\n\n  \nIn at least parts of the US a medical practice can dismiss a patient for verbal abuse, but the decision would probably have to be made by someone in the office with more authority than OP", "Yup, this patient 100% deserves to be reported for his abusive behavior", "I personally have never heard of someone not having to do a HIPPA training every year, but I have heard of places failing to comply with background checks and such.,which is my guess to what\u2019s going on-just a no compliance situation!", "No. I have lots of experience with this and know how this works. you can send messages to other staff and write little sticky note for yourself and your department that don\u2019t show up in the medical record because you don\u2019t write a formal note. You can also block patients from being able to read notes even though the record still says they exist. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t automatically get your notes from a psychiatrist or psychologist.", "I worked at a private practice and I never got HIPAA training. \n\nBut to be fair it was a really bad job and they had a lot of shady business practices.", "I was not trained on HIPAA and I would personally bill people.\n\nCan u see why I ended up quitting?", "I spent five years in radiology scheduling and one of the first things they told you in training was that if you put a note in the patient's electronic chart or sent a message through the program's messaging system was that it all goes if a patient requests their records. If you keep the note separate from the official chart or use a separate messaging program that's one thing, but anything attached to the official electronic record stays in there forever. Psychiatry/psychology is probably handled differently due to the nature of the practice, but for most medical purposes you absolutely cannot withhold information about the patient from the patient. It's illegal and unethical.", "I\u2019ve spent 8 years as a doctor and know plenty of ways to send messages and document things for myself and members of my department using our EMR without it being part of the official record. Maybe you have one that doesn\u2019t use that or it isn\u2019t part of the training. It\u2019s not illegal to have a tag on someone\u2019s chart or post a warning note. It\u2019s not the same as withholding medical information.", "It's not illegal to have the tag or post the note, it would be illegal to not include that in a medical records request if it were in the EMR.\n\nETA: it has to be included because it can speak to how the patient has been handled in the office. If there's a question of discrimination or poor patient handling by a staff member and there is a note that would reflect that behavior, you're withholding evidence of that bad behavior.", "Nope. The whole point of theses messages is not to have them be part of the patient\u2019s official record. Sometimes the systems even have little notes that say \u201cthis will not be saved to the patient\u2019s medical record.\u201d It is a good idea to make a paper trail of what happened in case you are building a case for firing them, but if warn a coworker has a tendency to yell a lot, or you want to make a note to ask a patient something next time, you can do that without it being part of the record. Maybe they could get it with a warrant? But for sure not a standard medical records request. Pretty sure that if it were illegal, a major company wouldn\u2019t have it built into the system.\n\nYou might not have these features in your EMR. You might have them and not know about them or use them.  But I have used them and thus know they exist, and I\u2019ve looked through patient\u2019s medical records not seeing every message that\u2019s ever been sent about them inside their chart so I know they work.", "NTA. I go to the doctor all the time because I have a chronic illness. I can't tell you how many times I have to fill that stuff out. He should have expected it considering how often he says he's in there. You were just doing your job.", "I don\u2019t think that it is an excuse, but people are often very anxious when they are going to see a doctor. The patient may have been very worried that he was about to find out that he was dying. You don\u2019t know what goes through people\u2019s minds.", "Your coworkers don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, bc you didn\u2019t. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m a server and get complaints about the menu or prices all the time (I work at one of the best pizza restaurants in a big city, so the pizzas are pricey. Menu complaints are due to us not having the ingredients to make a hawaiian pizza).I make $2.13/hour. What the fuck do they expect me to do about it?", "This is my job too! It blows me away that people get upset about doing paperwork in a doctor's office. I just always assume I will have to do some kind of paperwork updates there.", "NTA. I work in retail. Whenever they call you \"rude\" it's just projection.", "I was very prepared to call you T A but in this case absolutely not. Previous manager of a doctors office and you did your job exactly as you should have. You are not expected to know the patient since you\u2019re new but also HIPAA requires this for your job. \n\nNTA", "Omg. Darlin. He literally called you a bitch and cursed at you in a professional setting. You're worried about being rude for being blunt with him? Beloved. He was absolutely a jackass and you are so NTA here.", "I get what he\u2019s saying. The OP is definitely NTA but I bet you bottom dollar the patient has to fill every single thing out including his name. \nA fe doctors have gotten more savvy and print out a sheet prepopulated with the responses and you just change the ones that have changed. literally it\u2019s a document merge and would cut work time.", "Ehhh I'll go with a little bit of ESH. The guy was definitely a complete asshole but it's also incumbent of office staff to understand and explain some of this stuff to patients. \n\nNo one likes hearing \"It's policy\". OP wouldn't and neither would anyone else in the thread. \n\nThey don't have to like the \"why\" but it's good to know why you're doing something and not just \"following orders\".", "Also\u2014-Unless you don\u2019t work with any insurance companies your boss is  definitely not abiding by your contract with the plans. YIKES", "It's mandatory, they're just not doing it. OSHA training is also an annual requirement,"]}
