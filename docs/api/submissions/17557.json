I'm (38m) estranged from my parents and the majority of my siblings. I won't go into details so the post will stay up, but my mom is/was an abusive person. It took a lot to cut them off and I paid a toll. My mother, my stepfather, nor my siblings show an interest in my children's lives. They don't reach out to them, talk to them, spend any time with them. My parents occasionally send my teens (I have 5 children, they only do this for my eldest two) birthday money via Amazon, but not otherwise have no relationship with them. There are a few people on my bio family side that I do have positive relationships with and so do my children. \n\nI'm very involved in my children's lives, 3 live with me and my eldest two are teens who stay at my place several times a month. I go to school plays, help with homework, am a shoulder to cry, play games with them, etc.\n\nSo my ex-wife (38f) texted me for the contact info for my estranged family to invite them to my 18 year old's graduation party this summer. I made it clear, like I have in the past, that I'm nc, I don't want them around, and they haven't shown any interest in being around. She insists on \"doing her part\" by inviting them anyway and says if they have no interest they won't show up. My mother, my stepfather, my sister, and 2 of my brothers, that I don't want to be around. The thought of it makes me tremble and have me reaching for a Valium. \n\nI let her know if she insists on inviting them then I, my wife, our children (my sons siblings), and my in-laws won't attend. She said so be it, but I'm putting my feelings over my son's celebration and tried to guilt me about missing a huge event for my son, but I know my son isn't insisting on inviting these toxic estranged family of mine, she is, just so she feels she's \"done her part\", whatever that means. She's going to contact them and invite them with or without my help.\n\nI haven't yet talked to my son about this cause I try not to involve him in family or parenting drama. I've considered a seperate graduation party, but I don't think his school friends would be able to go to 2 or the rest of his total family. It would pale next to the \"real\" graduation party that I'd be missing in the off chance these people show up.\n\nIdk what to do. Should I \"suck it up\", attend and support, and dip out early with my wife and kids if they do show up, or do I throw a seperate bash, or do I somehow convince my son to talk his mother out of her invitation decisions? WIBTA for not going (along with 3 of his siblings and my wife)?\n\nI'm leaning heavily toward not going, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1684421612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l19b3/wibta_for_not_attending_my_sons_graduation_party/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That means you will not be attending but will throw a separate, safe celebration that his mother will not be allowed to attend in case she brings these relatives with her.\n\nHer behaviour is dangerous. Anyone who puts the image of togetherness ahead of the physical safety of their children is a bad parent. Your son needs to be made aware of that, and the only person you are protecting now is your ex-wife. The idea of not bad mouthing a former spouse doesn't mean covering for them when they make dangerous decisions, and now that your son is 18, he should be the main voice in how these celebrations are organised, not excluded.\n\nStay safe, and keep your children safe from your ex-wife's behaviour.", "NTA. I was gonna say your kind of an AH for not just asking your son but then it donned on me: You are being attacked.\n\nYour ex-wife knows your relationship. Your ex-wife knows these people's name.

You are being gaslit my friend. She doesn't care. She just wants you in this turmoil. \n\nMy evil side says \"give in\" and just give her false information.

Does he even want them at his party?  \n\nHonestly, go.  **Your ex invited them not to \"do her part\" towards them, but to deliberately provoke you.**  She hasn't rocked up to this situation yesterday.  She knows perfectly well these people are toxic, not in your life, and most importantly, why.

No.  *It's to keep you in it.* \n\nShe isn't worried about \"her part\" of anything.  She either wants to be able to shake her head at your son and say, \"See, your Dad is so cold, he wouldn't even attend your party just because his poor, misunderstood, loving family MIGHT have been here...\"  OR, shake her head at all the guests and your family, talking about how she \"just doesn't understand why OP is so selfish\",  or, even more cynically, she wants a chance to talk to the $$$$ giving parents in the hopes she can open up the money train for herself without you getting in the way. \n\n*She wants you not to go.*  She's counting on you staying at home to lick your wounds so she can look like the bigger person and the better parent.

She makes sure I'm informed of events in their lives if I'm not already from talking to them directly, sends me photos of them regularly, and will call me to be peacemaker when she's not getting along with them or to support her parenting decisions in her home. We got together young and moved on from divorce stuff.\n\nBut when it comes to my family she never respects my boundaries. She has always insisted that they're as much our sons' family as mine and it's not fair for me to \"deprive them\" of family. That family isn't hers, but she has gone around me in the past under the justification that it's our kids family, not just mine. It's infuriating actually. We get along for the most part but she doesn't respect me. Never has. She includes me cause I'm their father, but my opinion on 99% of matters carry 0% weight with her.", ">That doesn't make any sense. I don't want them an opportunity to rsvp anything, I don't want them invited at all, I want to not see these people for the rest of my life.\n\nExactly.  You're mad that they have the opportunity to RSVP.  Not they are actually going to be there because you don't know if they will be yet.  \n\nYou're punishing your son because you're mad at his mom.  Not because you're afraid to see them because at this point you don't even know if you would.", "You wbta if you don't talk to your son about the conflict.  For one, this will give you a chance to control the narrative and explain what's going on and how you will handle it.\n\nFor another thing, He may not even be aware of his mother's actions and he may be able to put a stop to it. If he can't put a stop to it, you can at least give him a heads-up:\n\nYou shouldn't let your fear control you. Your son IS more important than these people. So Go to his graduation party. If they show up, avoid them and leave as soon as you can do so politely. If they decide to force conversation, prearrange a signal with your wife and quietly pack up the children and leave without drama. If your son is aware of what is going down and why, HE is less likely to have any negative reactions to it (what your ex thinks isn't relevant).\n\nETA oh. and. Don't give your ex the information. Tell her you \"misplaced it\" or \"don't remember.\"  You do not have to be an active participant in whatever mind game your ex  is attempting to play with you here.", "NTA - hold your own graduation party for your son. Also, congrats to your son.", "You should suck it up.\nIt\u2019s your son graduation and you should be there for him.\nYou can survive other people there, you don\u2019t even have to talk to them. This is about your son", "NTA.... But why would actually give her their contact info then if you don't want them invited? Problem solved.", "Your first pirt of call is your child. Time to be honest. Second port of call is where you validate his achievements without dragging him into the mire.", "I'd attend on my own to support my son, but leave immediately after.  Let your son know in advance if they attend you'll be leaving immediately after he graduates and you'll celebrate with him later.  I wouldn't want to miss this event in his life (he could hold resentment).   If you go pretend you've only met them once before and ignore them after a nod of greeting.  Take your pill before you go and uber there and back.  \n\nYou wouldn't be an AH if you don't go.  But you'll regret it.   No verdict.", "Ah so your ex waited until your kid together was no longer legally a child so she\u2019d get away with trying to alienate you?  That sucks bro, I\u2019m sorry.", "I think your idea of going there early and then stepping out when/if the family arrive is a good compromise. However, first share that plan with your son and explain that you cannot personally be around them. It\u2019s a shame they\u2019re chasing you off from such an important event but if you\u2019re getting such a strong anxiety reaction, I don\u2019t think you have much choice.", "NTA,  Does he want them there? It sounds like your ex is doing this so you will not be there.  Have a sit down with your son. If he does not want them there the two of you need to stand up to her. If she still refused to uninvite them, you and your son can be a no show.", "NTA you need to talk to your son.", "NTA.  You need to talk to your son.  He's not a child and it is HIS graduation.  Your Ex sounds like she's just trying to stir the pot and she's doing a good job of it.  Your son DOES need to be a part of this decision.", "NTA - Your ex is a bad person.", "That and if the son is not understanding, then he can't say OP didn't say anything beforehand. AND OP should say that in front or in writing with his ex-wife and his wife plus anyone else on OP's side,so that there's no misinterpretation especially on his ex-wife's end.\n\nNTA and ex-wife really trying to shit-start drama so much, hate to see what haens when it's other kids' graduations and/or wedding(s)....", "I'll be at his graduation, this is the graduation party, a seperate event a month after the graduation.", "I'm not trying make a point. I'm trying to stay as far away from them as I can and for years I've been able to avoid any and all interaction with them. Except now they're all going to be invited to a place and time I'll be and if I'm not there I'm told I'm selfish. I don't want to make any points or have any drama, I want to go to my sons graduation party, just like I will be at his graduation, and the only thing that could keep me from being there is those people there. All she has to do is not send them any invites and there would be no issues. It's not about making or scoring points.", "I refused, she said she's gonna contact them by other means anyway (social media). I can't actually stop her from finding and contacting people (she knows who they are even if she doesnt have a current address or phone number) where the internet exists. I can try to convince her but that has and will fail. I can try to get my son to convince her, but I loathe the thought of burdening him with intervening. I could go and leave if they show up. I could not go and do something else with/for him. Those are my options.", "The graduation is a month before the graduation party. I will definitely be at his graduation.", "Talking this out with him would be the best move.\n\nOne suggestion. Don't just talk about it in terms of this event. Take the time to discuss the future too. There will be other events down the road like this (eg. college graduation, wedding). Events where he may see his mom pushing to invite your estranged family, knowing that it would mean you not attending.\n\nThe point would be not to place a burden or pressure on him, but so that he understands that going forward the choice will ultimately be his as to who he celebrates his life events with. But that due to family history, those choices will have consequences.\n\nBeing clear on this now may help to spare a lot of hurt feelings down the road.\n\nSecond suggestion, as an alternative to a second party, maybe consider offering to do a small trip later in the summer. Either just the two of you or him and your immediate family. May not even have to be an overnight trip. Depending on whats of interest to him in your area, a whole day outing together may be just as good.\n\nMaking it something different may help it feel less like a \"two separate parties\" thing.", "Skip that party, organise another thing for you and your son.", "You know what, absolutely fair and valid point.\n\nI had/have an extremely absent family, so my thoughts instantly go to how this would make OPs child feel. \nBut you're right, I didn't consider how op has been affected by those people.", "I'm sorry.  I guess I didn't read the whole thing correctly.   Don't go to the party and let him know why.  Tell him to message you if they don't show and you can go then.   I'm sorry.", "Being rich doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t be greedy \ud83d\ude43", "Personally, I am no contact with all of my surviving family due to neglect/abuse. We all have our own struggles that colour how we see the world. \n\nI'm actually really happy you considered my point and that this didn't turn into an internet slanging match. Have a nice day! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "> What is she getting out of this?\n\nTormenting her ex. That's all thats left.", "She has never seen the abusive, toxic side of these people. I'm sorry she doesn't seem to \"get it\" where your family is concerned. At this point, I think your best option is talk to your son and see what he wants, then you go from there. If he wants them to be invited, you can decide if your mental health will allow you to go and dip out if they show, or if you want to do a separate, smaller party for him (just you, wife, siblings) on a different day and avoid them. If these people have never really been a part of his life, I don't understand on her insistence of \"family\" at his party. When you keep abusive people away from you and your kids, that's not depriving them of anything, that's protecting them. Good luck.", "Ok."]}
