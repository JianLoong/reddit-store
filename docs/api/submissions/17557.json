I'm (38m) estranged from my parents and the majority of my siblings. I won't go into details so the post will stay up, but my mom is/was an abusive person. It took a lot to cut them off and I paid a toll. My mother, my stepfather, nor my siblings show an interest in my children's lives. They don't reach out to them, talk to them, spend any time with them. My parents occasionally send my teens (I have 5 children, they only do this for my eldest two) birthday money via Amazon, but not otherwise have no relationship with them. There are a few people on my bio family side that I do have positive relationships with and so do my children. \n\nI'm very involved in my children's lives, 3 live with me and my eldest two are teens who stay at my place several times a month. I go to school plays, help with homework, am a shoulder to cry on, give advice, play games with them, etc.\n\nSo my ex-wife (38f) texted me for the contact info for my estranged family to invite them to my 18 year old's graduation party this summer. I made it clear, like I have in the past, that I'm nc, I don't want them around, and they haven't shown any interest in being around. She insists on \"doing her part\" by inviting them anyway and says if they have no interest they won't show up. My mother, my stepfather, my sister, and 2 of my brothers, that I don't want to be around. The thought of it makes me tremble and have me reaching for a Valium. \n\nI let her know if she insists on inviting them then I, my wife, our children (my sons siblings), and my in-laws won't attend. She said so be it, but I'm putting my feelings over my son's celebration and tried to guilt me about missing a huge event for my son, but I know my son isn't insisting on inviting these toxic estranged family of mine, she is, just so she feels she's \"done her part\", whatever that means. She's going to contact them and invite them with or without my help.\n\nI haven't yet talked to my son about this cause I try not to involve him in family or parenting drama. I've considered a seperate graduation party, but I don't think his school friends would be able to go to 2 or the rest of his total family. It would pale next to the \"real\" graduation party that I'd be missing in the off chance these people show up.\n\nIdk what to do. Should I \"suck it up\", attend and support, and dip out early with my wife and kids if they do show up, or do I throw a seperate bash, or do I somehow convince my son to talk his mother out of her invitation decisions? WIBTA for not going (along with 3 of his siblings and my wife)?\n\nI'm leaning heavily toward not going, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1684421612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l19b3/wibta_for_not_attending_my_sons_graduation_party/", "score": 439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And adults communicate. You need to tell him that your ex-wife is insisting upon exposing you AND him to incredibly abusive relatives, and that you will of course not be allowing her to put you at risk. That means you will not be attending but will throw a separate, safe celebration that his mother will not be allowed to attend in case she brings these relatives with her.\n\nHer behaviour is dangerous. Anyone who puts the image of togetherness ahead of the physical safety of their children is a bad parent. Your son needs to be made aware of that, and the only person you are protecting now is your ex-wife. The idea of not bad mouthing a former spouse doesn't mean covering for them when they make dangerous decisions, and now that your son is 18, he should be the main voice in how these celebrations are organised, not excluded.\n\nStay safe, and keep your children safe from your ex-wife's behaviour.", "NTA. I was gonna say your kind of an AH for not just asking your son but then it donned on me: You are being attacked.\n\nYour ex-wife knows your relationship. Your ex-wife knows these people's name.

Shes had 18 years to get these peoples information and it has clearly never mattered. \n\nYet now, as you transition to a new standard of interacting with her (eldest are teens/about to leave nest), suddenly she needs you to give her info then agree to \"suck up\" your trauma. You are being gaslit my friend. She doesn't care. She just wants you in this turmoil. \n\nMy evil side says \"give in\" and just give her false information.

If these people barely know your son, and don't have a relationship with him, your ex, or you; what's the chances they show up?\n\n\nAnd, even if they do show up... where is this being held?

Does he even want them at his party?  \n\nHonestly, go.  **Your ex invited them not to \"do her part\" towards them, but to deliberately provoke you.**  She hasn't rocked up to this situation yesterday.  She knows perfectly well these people are toxic, not in your life, and most importantly, why.

No.  *It's to keep you in it.* \n\nShe isn't worried about \"her part\" of anything.  She either wants to be able to shake her head at your son and say, \"See, your Dad is so cold, he wouldn't even attend your party just because his poor, misunderstood, loving family MIGHT have been here...\"  OR, shake her head at all the guests and your family, talking about how she \"just doesn't understand why OP is so selfish\",  or, even more cynically, she wants a chance to talk to the $$$$ giving parents in the hopes she can open up the money train for herself without you getting in the way. \n\n*She wants you not to go.*  She's counting on you staying at home to lick your wounds so she can look like the bigger person and the better parent.
