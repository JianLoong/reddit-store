It\u2019s really nice since we never fight because we generally agree on everything. It\u2019s been great. \n\nBiggest problem though is she doesn\u2019t like me sleep with me. We have sex regularly but she hates sleeping in the same bed. She is a very light sleeper and any turning, snoring, getting up on my part wakes her up. And then she claims she can\u2019t get back to sleep and spends the whole night awake. \n\nShe recently proposed we sleep in separate beds in the same room. But our new apartment has tiny rooms so she can\u2019t move another bed into the same room. She says she wants to sleep in the other room and maybe move to a place with a larger room next time but I don\u2019t want that. \n\nMy parents have a very unhappy marriage and they sleep in separate rooms because they hate each other. I know we aren\u2019t doing it for the same reasons but it brings back unpleasant memories and I would want my partner to sleep in the same bed. But I\u2019ve told her that and she claims I\u2019m being selfish for ruining her sleep because of my issues. She says it\u2019s ruining her mental health and she\u2019s preforming worse at work.

There are few things more important to mental health than sleep.\n\nMaybe start being a part of the solution instead of being a part of the problem?! \nThat your parents had a bad relationship and slept separately says absolutely nothing about your relationship with your girlfriend and how you choose your sleeping arrangements.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - You\u2019re putting your own needs and insecurities ahead of her physical and mental health.

I would HATE sleeping separately from my partner and we are fortunately that we sleep well together (by which I mean we both sleep terribly no matter what but sleeping alone vs together doesn't make it better or worse). I get it makes you feel weird because of your parents but LOTS of happy relationships involve sleeping separately some or all of the time. It's on you to work through your hang ups with it. Or decide that it's a deal breaker and move on. But you will NOT like the results if you force the issue and she ends up sleep deprived and rightly resentful of you. Sleep deprivation is legally classified as torture. That's no way to live. Trust me because I do.", "YTA, this is soo selfish. You\u2019re expecting your partner to put her mental health and job second to your wants.\n\nHave you tried sleeping in a straight jacket strapped to the bed so you can\u2019t move? No?

Melatonin works on a hilariously small proportion of the population. And even if it did, it\u2019s pretty messed up that you\u2019d rather your girlfriend take something to be out cold in the same bed as you rather than sleep separately. Get therapy.", "YTA, she\u2019s not sleeping. You are putting your desire to sleep in the same bed above your partners health and well being. A solution may be instead of sharing a bed push to singles next to each other, looks like the same bed but separate duvets and mattresses so your turning wouldn\u2019t wake her?", "Sorry but YTA for allowing your parents issues to taint your relationship. Your partner can't sleep with you.  It's not that she doesn't WANT to but physically cant. Big difference. Let her sleep in a separate room or split up.", "YTA. Sleeping separately is more common than you think and for the reasons your gf is outlining. I am a light sleeper and I usually sleep in a separate bed. My partner appreciates my need for sleep but also likes a cuddle so what we often do is that I stay in with them until they're asleep (they fall asleep in like 10 minutes, max) then I go into the other room. Other times I just go straight into the room. You should get over your emotional issue rather than expecting her to get over her physical issue. You can cure being a light sleeper, you can cure your demanding 'you must sleep with me or it's not a proper relationship' attitude", "Sure you can continue sharing a bed if you want her to grow to resent you. Take it from someone who has sleep issues and tried to share a bed with her husband for years. I grew to resent him every night I lay awake because he woke me up or was snoring. \n\nThe best thing we ever did was get separate rooms. Yes sharing a bed is sweet and romantic but for some it is impractical. \n\nSorry YTA", "YTA. Do you know how miserable it is to go for two months with poor sleep?  That's mind- and soul-crushing. Her mental and physical well-being is more important that your weird bias against people who don't share beds (I have several friends in very happy long-term marriages who don't share beds).  Go to therapy to fix your issue and let your girlfriend get some sleep.", "YTA. You think your feelings come before her health and well-being. Or bare minimum, you think her health and well-being are of equal importance to your preferences - they are not. Again YTA", "YTA. \n\nIf she can't sleep because of you, she will leave you. Guaranteed. \n\nYou need to figure out what you value more - this woman and relationship, or physical closeness and intimacy while sleeping. These things will not coalesce in this relationship and that might be a deal breaker for you (which is valid!)", "YTA. Let the woman sleep. It's also not good for sleep patterns to be reliant on sleep aids like melatonin all the time so this isn't a viable solution. She's tried and she's exhausted. I'd say NAH because I understand you wanting to share a bed but she's tried and it doesn't sound like you really understand how she feels.\n\nMy parents sleep in separate rooms because my mum has terrible insomnia and restless leg syndrome. They're very much still happily married, and even happier since they don't share a bed. Your issues are yours and your girlfriend is not obliged to make herself unhappy (and eventually ill) because of them. \n\nI know this is kind of harshly worded, but you need to hear it, and this hit very close to home for me :)\n\nSincerely, another very light sleeper who can't stand to wear ear plugs and also really struggles sharing a bed.", "YTA\n\nI really wish we could promote the idea of couples sleeping separately.\n\nLet the woman sleep.", "YTA.  You are being selfish.  You're letting your triggered memories of trauma you experienced influence her health.  Not sleeping DOES ruin your mental health.  It impairs your ability to function.  Why do you care if she is SLEEPING somewhere else??  You're literally asking her to take medication to appease your emotional trauma instead of just letting her sleep where she won't be disturbed.\n\nI'm single now but if I do ever end up in a relationship again and we do decide to move in together, this will be a deal breaker for me.  Separate bedrooms because I don't sleep good and I move A LOT which means not only will the other persons sleeping noises disturb me but I'm likely to disturb them as well.  If they can't handle that then we can either stay together and live separately or we can break up.  I refuse to sacrifice my mental health just for someone to have their way with sleeping arrangements.", "YTA - But soft YTA, it is a totally understandable thing to sleep in separate beds. There's been studies done that for some couples it is extremely beneficial to sleep in separate beds. With your history with your parents its understandable, too, why you would be apprehensive. However, you won't win this. If you force it she may leave and if she doesn't well then you're taking away from her health for it. You say you wanna try other things but who's to say she hasn't tried those things and they've failed. \n\nLastly, it might help you to see a professional to simply work through the marks your parents left on you. Doesn't mean you need help forever, but if you're so scared that sleeping in separate beds will ruin your relationship (when in reality it will aid it) then it doesn't hurt to talk to someone who might be able to help you reframe your perspective.", "YTA - she has given you valid reasons as to why it\u2019s best for her mental health to sleep in a different room at night. It\u2019s now affecting her job on top of that and you still think you\u2019re in the right for trying to force other methods that she says does not work for her? Not all partners who sleep in different rooms are miserable and unhappy like your parents. If you really care about your partner you would want her to get some good rest at night and not have to work day in and day out exhausted. Quit being selfish.", "YTA. A lot of happy couples also sleep in separate rooms so they can both get enough sleep. Proper sleep is super important. More important than your hang ups.", "YTA - Plenty of happy couples sleep in separate rooms/beds. Your an AH for expecting your GF to go without sleep to accommodate your insecurities. Your insecurities about this are a YOU issue, which means you need to deal with it rather than expecting her to accommodate it.", "YTA\n\nYou're basically expecting your girlfriend to share a bed with you despite knowing she won't be able to sleep.\nAnd all because it reminds you or your parents who hated each other?\n\nHow is that her problem?\n\nLet the poor woman sleep!", "How about you start the evening for cuddling and sex cuddling etc then separate for actual sleep part then go back in same bed in the morning so u can wake up together", "I'll go YTA. While I do find it odd that she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed with you, it seems that this is simply something you are going to have to accept if you want to be with her long-term. She's been clear about what she wants. You have too. Either it results in a compromise or the relationship won't work.\n\nRegardless, you're not going to be able to dictate how others live. That would make YTA.", "YTA, she wants to sleep in another room so she can have a full night sleep, not because she's in a unhappy relationship with you. You are selfish, not sleeping enough is making her exhausted. Do you prefer her being miserable for your comfort?", "YTA\n\nYou don't seem to care that she's not sleeping. It's not just that she's tired one day...it adds up and is crazy making. Crazy throughout the night when you can't sleep. Crazy during the day when you're tired and irritable. Crazy in your head when you realize there's no relief in sight.\n\nDon't down play it.\n\nGet one of those bunk beds with a full on the bottom and twin on the top. Don't bring your parents marriage into your relationship, unless they taught you how to compromise and be considerate to each other.", "NAH. She has light sleep and sleep is extremely important. I understand her side. I also understand yours because not only it's an usual expectation but brings back bad memories.\n\nHave you considered two single beds side by side with a small separation? Like an inch or so? Since she suggested sleeping in the same room it seems her issue is more the tossing and that would handle that. Bonus is that you can bring it close together to enjoy cuddling but separate it when it's sleep time.", "YTA \n\nHow would you feel if she woke you up every time your snoring or turning woke her? It\u2019s not because she doesn\u2019t love you, she just needs calm and silence to sleep.", "Gentle YTA - I get it, I am the same way as your GF.  My fiance is a furnace and snores like a 747.  If I wake up, I cannot get back to sleep, so I get it.  Melatonin does not work on me either.  She deserves the chance to have a good night's sleep, and if sleeping in another bed or another room without you is a deal breaker for you, find someone else.", "YTA for the way you talk about your gf and this situation.\n\n  >I\u2019d rather we try other methods\n\n  But you admit she\u2019s already tried sleeping with you for 2 months. It\u2019s impacting her health and work.\n\n  >melatonin which she claims doesn\u2019t work on her\n\n  Why did you say claims? Believe what your gf says about her own body.\n\n  >she is now demanding to sleep in her own bed\n\n  Dude, she\u2019s a grown adult whose sleep is being wrecked by trying to accommodate you. She shouldn\u2019t have to ask your permission to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Wanting to sleep by herself is not unreasonable. Also, you didn\u2019t describe anything on her end that sounds like demanding. It sounds like she tried really hard to do what you want and she just can\u2019t without it affecting her health. Honestly it sounds like YOU are demanding that she continue to sacrifice her well-being to meet your emotional needs.\n\n  You claim to love your gf. Why don\u2019t you listen to what she says she needs, believe her, and support her? Until then, yes YTA.", "YTA. Sleep is very important and she's not getting it. You say everything else in the relationship is great so stop being insecure. Figure out a better solution if it's really so important for you, like getting a mattress and sleep on the floor beside her if a bed can't fit. Or just move.", "NAH. OP, your concerns are valid, but please understand your parents issues do not stem from sleeping in separate rooms, that's just a byproduct. If your partner is physically ill from a lack of sleep, then find a solution with her. If that means separate bedrooms, at least during the work week, then give it a try. \n\nYou will also be happier with a well-rested, happier partner. Just my .02.", "YTA! Let her have a good sleep! What is the problem? You are so controlling. Let her be confortable. You are living together anyway and sharing quality time.", "YTA. This is not your parents\u2019 marriage.

Treat your partner the way you\u2019d treat someone you actually like.", "YTA\n\nSee a therapist, and buy another bed for your new 2 bedroom apartment.  THAT is how you have a successful lasting relationship.", "YTA- I get where you\u2019re coming from, but expecting someone to give up good sleep for ever is not ok. If your snoring and getting up at night to the point where it effects both your sleep patterns you should get checked for sleep apnea", "I'm sorry, but until you can figure out how to not disturb her sleep, let her sleep somewhere else.

She deserves a good night rest.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Melatonin doesn\u2019t work on me either. Sleep is important.

You need to see a doctor about the loud snoring, about how you toss and turn throughout the night. \n\nShe is tired of being woken up, not getting back to sleep and lacking what she needs, and her solution is a fair one.  She is not wanting to break up with you, but if you do not show any sort of concern for her well being, you are going to lose her.  Or worse you may find that loving person to become a raging monster, who despises you due to a lack of sleep and unable to get any sort of peaceful sleep.\n\nI get her point of view.  My own spouse, snores loudly, tosses and turns.  For the longest while, hard on me, and I would sleep on the couch or elsewhere to get restful sleep much needed or I was very grumpy in the morning.
