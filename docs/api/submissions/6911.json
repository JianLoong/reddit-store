It\u2019s really nice since we never fight because we generally agree on everything. It\u2019s been great. \n\nBiggest problem though is she doesn\u2019t like me sleep with me. We have sex regularly but she hates sleeping in the same bed. She is a very light sleeper and any turning, snoring, getting up on my part wakes her up. And then she claims she can\u2019t get back to sleep and spends the whole night awake. \n\nShe recently proposed we sleep in separate beds in the same room. But our new apartment has tiny rooms so she can\u2019t move another bed into the same room. She says she wants to sleep in the other room and maybe move to a place with a larger room next time but I don\u2019t want that. \n\nMy parents have a very unhappy marriage and they sleep in separate rooms because they hate each other. I know we aren\u2019t doing it for the same reasons but it brings back unpleasant memories and I would want my partner to sleep in the same bed. But I\u2019ve told her that and she claims I\u2019m being selfish for ruining her sleep because of my issues. She says it\u2019s ruining her mental health and she\u2019s preforming worse at work.

There are few things more important to mental health than sleep.\n\nMaybe start being a part of the solution instead of being a part of the problem?! \nThat your parents had a bad relationship and slept separately says absolutely nothing about your relationship with your girlfriend and how you choose your sleeping arrangements.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - You\u2019re putting your own needs and insecurities ahead of her physical and mental health.

I would HATE sleeping separately from my partner and we are fortunately that we sleep well together (by which I mean we both sleep terribly no matter what but sleeping alone vs together doesn't make it better or worse). I get it makes you feel weird because of your parents but LOTS of happy relationships involve sleeping separately some or all of the time. It's on you to work through your hang ups with it. Or decide that it's a deal breaker and move on. But you will NOT like the results if you force the issue and she ends up sleep deprived and rightly resentful of you. Sleep deprivation is legally classified as torture. That's no way to live. Trust me because I do.", "YTA, this is soo selfish. You\u2019re expecting your partner to put her mental health and job second to your wants.\n\nHave you tried sleeping in a straight jacket strapped to the bed so you can\u2019t move? No?

Melatonin works on a hilariously small proportion of the population.

Get therapy.", "YTA, she\u2019s not sleeping. You are putting your desire to sleep in the same bed above your partners health and well being. A solution may be instead of sharing a bed push to singles next to each other, looks like the same bed but separate duvets and mattresses so your turning wouldn\u2019t wake her?", "Sorry but YTA for allowing your parents issues to taint your relationship. Your partner can't sleep with you.  It's not that she doesn't WANT to but physically cant. Big difference. Let her sleep in a separate room or split up.", "YTA. Sleeping separately is more common than you think and for the reasons your gf is outlining. I am a light sleeper and I usually sleep in a separate bed. My partner appreciates my need for sleep but also likes a cuddle so what we often do is that I stay in with them until they're asleep (they fall asleep in like 10 minutes, max) then I go into the other room. Other times I just go straight into the room. You should get over your emotional issue rather than expecting her to get over her physical issue. You can cure being a light sleeper, you can cure your demanding 'you must sleep with me or it's not a proper relationship' attitude", "Sure you can continue sharing a bed if you want her to grow to resent you. Take it from someone who has sleep issues and tried to share a bed with her husband for years. I grew to resent him every night I lay awake because he woke me up or was snoring. \n\nThe best thing we ever did was get separate rooms. Yes sharing a bed is sweet and romantic but for some it is impractical. \n\nSorry YTA", "YTA. Do you know how miserable it is to go for two months with poor sleep?  That's mind- and soul-crushing. Her mental and physical well-being is more important that your weird bias against people who don't share beds (I have several friends in very happy long-term marriages who don't share beds).  Go to therapy to fix your issue and let your girlfriend get some sleep.", "YTA. You think your feelings come before her health and well-being. Or bare minimum, you think her health and well-being are of equal importance to your preferences - they are not. Again YTA", "YTA. \n\nIf she can't sleep because of you, she will leave you. Guaranteed. \n\nYou need to figure out what you value more - this woman and relationship, or physical closeness and intimacy while sleeping. These things will not coalesce in this relationship and that might be a deal breaker for you (which is valid!)", "YTA. Let the woman sleep. It's also not good for sleep patterns to be reliant on sleep aids like melatonin all the time so this isn't a viable solution. She's tried and she's exhausted. I'd say NAH because I understand you wanting to share a bed but she's tried and it doesn't sound like you really understand how she feels.\n\nMy parents sleep in separate rooms because my mum has terrible insomnia and restless leg syndrome. They're very much still happily married, and even happier since they don't share a bed. Your issues are yours and your girlfriend is not obliged to make herself unhappy (and eventually ill) because of them. \n\nI know this is kind of harshly worded, but you need to hear it, and this hit very close to home for me :)\n\nSincerely, another very light sleeper who can't stand to wear ear plugs and also really struggles sharing a bed.", "YTA\n\nI really wish we could promote the idea of couples sleeping separately.\n\nLet the woman sleep.", "YTA.  You are being selfish.  You're letting your triggered memories of trauma you experienced influence her health.  Not sleeping DOES ruin your mental health.  It impairs your ability to function.  Why do you care if she is SLEEPING somewhere else??  You're literally asking her to take medication to appease your emotional trauma instead of just letting her sleep where she won't be disturbed.\n\nI'm single now but if I do ever end up in a relationship again and we do decide to move in together, this will be a deal breaker for me.  Separate bedrooms because I don't sleep good and I move A LOT which means not only will the other persons sleeping noises disturb me but I'm likely to disturb them as well.  If they can't handle that then we can either stay together and live separately or we can break up.  I refuse to sacrifice my mental health just for someone to have their way with sleeping arrangements.", "YTA - But soft YTA, it is a totally understandable thing to sleep in separate beds. There's been studies done that for some couples it is extremely beneficial to sleep in separate beds. With your history with your parents its understandable, too, why you would be apprehensive. However, you won't win this. If you force it she may leave and if she doesn't well then you're taking away from her health for it. You say you wanna try other things but who's to say she hasn't tried those things and they've failed. \n\nLastly, it might help you to see a professional to simply work through the marks your parents left on you. Doesn't mean you need help forever, but if you're so scared that sleeping in separate beds will ruin your relationship (when in reality it will aid it) then it doesn't hurt to talk to someone who might be able to help you reframe your perspective.", "YTA - she has given you valid reasons as to why it\u2019s best for her mental health to sleep in a different room at night. It\u2019s now affecting her job on top of that and you still think you\u2019re in the right for trying to force other methods that she says does not work for her? Not all partners who sleep in different rooms are miserable and unhappy like your parents. If you really care about your partner you would want her to get some good rest at night and not have to work day in and day out exhausted. Quit being selfish.", "YTA. A lot of happy couples also sleep in separate rooms so they can both get enough sleep. Proper sleep is super important. More important than your hang ups.", "YTA - Plenty of happy couples sleep in separate rooms/beds. Your an AH for expecting your GF to go without sleep to accommodate your insecurities. Your insecurities about this are a YOU issue, which means you need to deal with it rather than expecting her to accommodate it.", "YTA\n\nYou're basically expecting your girlfriend to share a bed with you despite knowing she won't be able to sleep.\nAnd all because it reminds you or your parents who hated each other?\n\nHow is that her problem?\n\nLet the poor woman sleep!", "How about you start the evening for cuddling and sex cuddling etc then separate for actual sleep part then go back in same bed in the morning so u can wake up together", "I'll go YTA. While I do find it odd that she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed with you, it seems that this is simply something you are going to have to accept if you want to be with her long-term. She's been clear about what she wants. You have too. Either it results in a compromise or the relationship won't work.\n\nRegardless, you're not going to be able to dictate how others live. That would make YTA.", "YTA, she wants to sleep in another room so she can have a full night sleep, not because she's in a unhappy relationship with you. You are selfish, not sleeping enough is making her exhausted. Do you prefer her being miserable for your comfort?", "YTA\n\nYou don't seem to care that she's not sleeping. It's not just that she's tired one day...it adds up and is crazy making. Crazy throughout the night when you can't sleep. Crazy during the day when you're tired and irritable. Crazy in your head when you realize there's no relief in sight.\n\nDon't down play it.\n\nGet one of those bunk beds with a full on the bottom and twin on the top. Don't bring your parents marriage into your relationship, unless they taught you how to compromise and be considerate to each other.", "NAH. She has light sleep and sleep is extremely important. I understand her side. I also understand yours because not only it's an usual expectation but brings back bad memories.\n\nHave you considered two single beds side by side with a small separation? Like an inch or so? Since she suggested sleeping in the same room it seems her issue is more the tossing and that would handle that. Bonus is that you can bring it close together to enjoy cuddling but separate it when it's sleep time.", "YTA \n\nHow would you feel if she woke you up every time your snoring or turning woke her? It\u2019s not because she doesn\u2019t love you, she just needs calm and silence to sleep.", "Gentle YTA - I get it, I am the same way as your GF.  My fiance is a furnace and snores like a 747.  If I wake up, I cannot get back to sleep, so I get it.  Melatonin does not work on me either.  She deserves the chance to have a good night's sleep, and if sleeping in another bed or another room without you is a deal breaker for you, find someone else.", "YTA for the way you talk about your gf and this situation.\n\n  >I\u2019d rather we try other methods\n\n  But you admit she\u2019s already tried sleeping with you for 2 months. It\u2019s impacting her health and work.\n\n  >melatonin which she claims doesn\u2019t work on her\n\n  Why did you say claims? Believe what your gf says about her own body.\n\n  >she is now demanding to sleep in her own bed\n\n  Dude, she\u2019s a grown adult whose sleep is being wrecked by trying to accommodate you. She shouldn\u2019t have to ask your permission to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Wanting to sleep by herself is not unreasonable. Also, you didn\u2019t describe anything on her end that sounds like demanding. It sounds like she tried really hard to do what you want and she just can\u2019t without it affecting her health. Honestly it sounds like YOU are demanding that she continue to sacrifice her well-being to meet your emotional needs.\n\n  You claim to love your gf. Why don\u2019t you listen to what she says she needs, believe her, and support her? Until then, yes YTA.", "YTA. Sleep is very important and she's not getting it. You say everything else in the relationship is great so stop being insecure. Figure out a better solution if it's really so important for you, like getting a mattress and sleep on the floor beside her if a bed can't fit. Or just move.", "NAH. OP, your concerns are valid, but please understand your parents issues do not stem from sleeping in separate rooms, that's just a byproduct. If your partner is physically ill from a lack of sleep, then find a solution with her. If that means separate bedrooms, at least during the work week, then give it a try. \n\nYou will also be happier with a well-rested, happier partner. Just my .02.", "YTA! Let her have a good sleep! What is the problem? You are so controlling. Let her be confortable. You are living together anyway and sharing quality time.", "YTA. This is not your parents\u2019 marriage.

Treat your partner the way you\u2019d treat someone you actually like.", "YTA\n\nSee a therapist, and buy another bed for your new 2 bedroom apartment.  THAT is how you have a successful lasting relationship.", "YTA- I get where you\u2019re coming from, but expecting someone to give up good sleep for ever is not ok. If your snoring and getting up at night to the point where it effects both your sleep patterns you should get checked for sleep apnea", "I'm sorry, but until you can figure out how to not disturb her sleep, let her sleep somewhere else.

She deserves a good night rest.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Melatonin doesn\u2019t work on me either. Sleep is important.

You need to see a doctor about the loud snoring, about how you toss and turn throughout the night. \n\nShe is tired of being woken up, not getting back to sleep and lacking what she needs, and her solution is a fair one.  She is not wanting to break up with you, but if you do not show any sort of concern for her well being, you are going to lose her.  Or worse you may find that loving person to become a raging monster, who despises you due to a lack of sleep and unable to get any sort of peaceful sleep.\n\nI get her point of view.  My own spouse, snores loudly, tosses and turns.  For the longest while, hard on me, and I would sleep on the couch or elsewhere to get restful sleep much needed or I was very grumpy in the morning.

Gf can\u2019t just somehow be less of a light sleeper.", "Because her choice is an individual choice, whereas OP\u2019s isn\u2019t.\n\nPerhaps I should\u2019ve worded it better. The point is her wellbeing in this case takes precedence.", "Then I\u2019m gonna say YTA because she tried it (like you requested) and it didn\u2019t work. You hoped you could change her mind and are now having a hard time accepting that you couldn\u2019t. Both of you already knew it might not work out. \nI hear you when you say that sleeping together is something you want in a relationship, I do too, but you can\u2019t change your partner. You have to decide if this is a relationship deal breaker or not.", "She tried it. It didn't work.  You're now saying your wants are more important than her physical and mental health. Sleep separately for now and be cool with it. Then, once she's back to feeling better MAYBE you can reopen the conversation of two beds/one room or trying other things, or even just sleeping together for part of the night or certain nights that won't negatively impact her.", "Have you tried sleeping in a straight jacket strapped to the bed so you can\u2019t move? No? Could it be because you wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep like that? So why tf is it okay to ask that she put her health and job at risk?", "demanding? you mean telling you she is miserable and wants to do something you dont like? YTA", "Why are your insecurities more important than her sleep and well-being?", "She gave it a shot. She doesn't want to anymore. Anyone who isn't a complete fucking asshole would have been PREPARED for that.", "Well unless you\u2019re prepared for the other pea to jump out of the pod, you\u2019d better accept the fact she needs her own bed. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to make another person suffer to appease your insecurities.\n\nYTA", "Have you ever slept only a few hours a night and constantly get woken up due to external factors?\n\nIt sucks a lot. Especially if it\u2019s an ongoing issue for 2 months.  It\u2019s painful and makes everyday a blur.\n\nI get why you want to physically sleep next to your gf. But what you\u2019re asking her to put your fears above her physical/mental well-being.  She\u2019s not well rested\u2026 and it\u2019s getting to the point that her daily responsibilities are being impacted due to her lack of sleep.\n\nShe gave it a shot for 2 months.  You had 2 months to work with her to find a solution to make this arrangement work and you couldn\u2019t.  So let your poor gf finally have a good quality sleep.  Maybe you two can occasionally sleep together at night.\n\nYTA btw.", "YTA hope she breaks up with you. Stop bothering her", "Him simply having a preference and communicating that to his partner doesn\u2019t make him an asshole. It seems like he\u2019s trying to find a way to help her get the sleeps she needs while sleeping together, (granted the melatonin suggestion isn\u2019t great).", "But not cosleeping for a foreseeable future would also be a sacrifice for him. I just think they have a compatibility issue here that may not be solvable", "Perhaps the more she sleeps in the bed with him overtime, the more accustom with it she'll become.", "Noise cancelling headphones doesn't help movement in the bed when someone rolls over.", "Wait, are suggesting she use noise cancelling headphones so she can sleep because she is a light sleeper and wants a good night's rest? Have you tried sleeping with headphones on? How is that comfortable? And she would likely still wake up as soon as OP rolls over or gets up to pee. It's not just noises that wake a light sleeper.", "Also for many, like me, melatonin gives bad nightmares. I stopped taking it because I would have vivid horrible nightmares, and the drowsiness the next day was awful", "Plus other sideeffects like headaches, dizziness, nausea, depression and increased aggressiveness", "You also can\u2019t take it in the middle of the night. I only take it if I know I have 6+ hours to go", "And wear a nasal strip! Those help with snoring if you\u2019re permanently congested.", "His preference is based on his own family trauma and he doesn't have any good suggestions to help the situation. Asking someone to sacrifice their health because of your own problems without providing any solutions seems pretty AH to me. \n\nIf he was asking for her to change one of her preferences for his, that would be different but sleep is really important to your physical and mental well being. It's insulting to ask someone to put their ability to function on the same level as your preference.", "sacrifice for him would be having a bed to himself, with an active sex life and a well rested partner\n\nsacrifice for her would be lack of sleep which leads to poor mental health, along with physical health issues down the line", "Or she'll break up with him due to not sleeping.", "Oh, that is not a good mindset to have. At all. Lol. That feels very like forcing her to do something she doesn't feel okay doing.", "So how much sleep deprivation would she have to suffer before he accepts that she needs to sleep alone?", "Yes! I sleep with headphones in every night, because I'm a light sleeper. I'm not suggesting OP is right in being pushy about sharing  a bed with his SO. I'm just saying if she WANTS to TRY sharing a bed with him on days she doesn't have to get up early, as a possible compromise for both of them, noise cancelling headphones might, possibly help.\n\nObviously that's not going to help if she's movement sensitive, but some people don't like to share rooms because the sound of someone just breathing can cause issues. In cases like that headphones may help.", "It gives me horrible nightmares.", "And I\u2019m not suggesting that she should have to make said sacrifice of sleep. But part of being in a relationship is communicating when something is bothering you and working on it together. If a solution that works for both people can\u2019t be reached then the relationship may not be compatible.\n\nI\u2019m not saying she needs to return to the same bed as him or saying she\u2019s an asshole for sleeping separate. And I agree he\u2019s not giving any great alternatives. But we all have sticking points in our relationships and it\u2019s something he needs to analyze and weigh if all of the positives he gets from this relationship outweigh not being able to cosleep.", "So basically he should be unhappy in the relationship vs ending it got it.", "I feel like your invalidating the issues OP had with his parents here. He clearly had it imprinted on him that sleeping together is important for him in a relationship. I don\u2019t think she should be forced to sleep in the same bed if it doesn\u2019t work for her clearly. But if this is a sticking point for both of them then they aren\u2019t compatible and should move on", "Well there is always a risk but if sleeping together is that important to OP, it may be a risk he is willing to take.", "I get where you are coming from and I agree if she isn't comfortable than she def shouldn't do it.  However, if we look at sleeping in the same bed as a skill or something that the body can be trained to do and the more open she is to trying it, the more her body and mind may be come accustom to it. Just think of any physical related skill you are adept at and compare it to the first time you did it (ie. riding a bike, sex, tying your shoe).", "I don't think should do anything she doesn't want to do but if she is willing to give it a try, she may grow more accustom to it. If she says no, OP has to deal.", "I think the odds are pretty low though. It would have to be someone that doesn't move around much themselves and only sleeps on their back because having headphones on when sleeping on your side cannot be comfortable. IDK maybe there are fabric ones? I've never seen any like that.", "Did he suggest ending it? This whole thing would be very different if he said \n\n\"hey, I have some past trauma and I need to co sleep. I can't ask you to sacrifice your sleep for me and I'm not willing to change. I think we should break up\".\n\nBut he didn't.", "I understand how he views it, but I also can see how she needs sleep to feel healthy/content in her relationship. I remember when my fathers snoring was at its worst before he got it checked out by a doctor. My mom was a walking zombie, never sleeping at night due to it. It isn't a healthy way to live life at all.\n\nAlso how OP is ignoring her discomfort for himself rubs me the wrong way. If my partner expressed discomfort sleeping in the same bed, yeah, I'd be disappointed. But, I'd be more than willing to make accommodations. Not ones like OP in the comments saying \"Oh she can use melatonin because I'm not happy\"\n\nIt's just odd to me how okay OP is with saying those kinds of things just because he doesn't want to sleep alone\n\nEDIT: OP says in the comments she tried for 2 months, and is now requesting her own bed. So, his GF has tried to make this work. It's at a point where he needs to listen to her. Clearly she hasn't been sleeping lol", "You can keep arguing with people, but you're in the minority and don't seem to be grasping the argument that feelings are not equivalent to health.", "How nice of him to be willing to risk her well-being and health AND their relationship to satisfy his hang ups.", "Good point.", "She tried it for two months OP says in the comments. Some people just can not sleep in a bed with someone else comfortably, and that's okay. He should be happy at all she feels comfortable enough to be open like this with him. \n\nThe fact that you're saying \"Her body can be trained to do it if she's open to it\" is creepy, dude. I'm concerned for your partners lol", "Again, how much sleep deprivation would it be ok for her to suffer for this little experiment?\n\nSleep deprivation has a very real long term on health. So basically he would be asking her to risk her health for his comfort.", "I see that as well. And my main point this whole time has been that him having this preference and communicating doesn\u2019t make him an asshole. That\u2019s part of being in a relationship. \n\nIf he continues to insist it and force it on her then that makes him an asshole. Him wanting to cosleep in a relationship is valid, but it clearly doesn\u2019t work in this relationship. He needs to come to terms with that and decide what he wants to do", "And again, I\u2019m not arguing that she should be losing her health. Nor am I arguing that she should have to make any sacrifice here. I agree with everyone that she doesn\u2019t need to return to cosleeping, but it also doesn\u2019t mean that the situation is one that OP has to be ok with. His options are to find a solution that actually addresses her issues, become comfortable sleeping separate, or end the relationship.", ">She tried it for two months OP says in the comments. \n\nWhoa totally miss that part. Point taken.\n\nLol when you quote me like that it does come off very creepy. I guess I just meant that people can get used to things over time. Mea culpa", "...ok. But what did he do? He dumped his personal trauma on her and gave a non-solution to solve his preference. He didn't consider separate sleeping at all. That's pretty AH behavior.", "No, you're fine! I had to look on his profile for the comment. The way of wording from the situation def sounds creepy, but things over text without tone of voice can always sound off. \n\nThe whole part about the two months is what got me though. And how he's trying to justify it by his parents marriage like dude..to a point, I get it. But OP expresses a very healthy sex life, relationship, etc. It's nothing close to his parents from what it sounds like lmao", "I do agree that the \u201csolution\u201d he offers is not really a solution. \n\nI also think he should try separate sleeping for minimum 2 months like she tried cosleeping according to one of his comments. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve been trying to say this whole time is that sleeping separately is something HE needs to decide on. He needs to weigh if it\u2019s important enough to him to ruin this relationship over. \n\nAnd him expressing his trauma to his girlfriend is communicating. That\u2019s what couples are supposed to do with each other not bottle it up", "See now I am totally on board with your point of view. She gave it a real try and determined it just wasn't for her. \n\nAt this point, OP needs to accept this as part of the relationship. If suddenly the sex life or intimacy in other ways plummets then he should reevaluate the relationship. Right now it does seem like almost a medical issue that requires two separate beds.", "I've got free time so I'm just arguing for fun. No malice:)\n\n>I also think he should try separate sleeping for minimum 2 months like she tried cosleeping according to one of his comments. \n\nThat's great, but he didn't do that. He just threw out a poor solution that only benefited him.\n\n>The only thing I\u2019ve been trying to say this whole time is that sleeping separately is something HE needs to decide on. He needs to weigh if it\u2019s important enough to him to ruin this relationship over\n\nThis is a great point his therapist should bring up, but that's not what we're evaluating. This is AITA, and we're looking at the way he handled this situation. Which ties into...\n\n>And him expressing his trauma to his girlfriend is communicating. That\u2019s what couples are supposed to do with each other not bottle it up.\n\nDid he do that? Did he say something like \"this is something that gives me a lot of anxiety based on my familial experience. Could we work on a way to get you the sleep you need and accommodate my preference?\" No! He said this is important because of my trauma so here's a half ass solution which requires no sacrifice from him. Additionally, he doesn't listen when his partner already knows it will not work! \n\nLike...that's an AH. Straight up.\n\nIf this dude wants to break up with his girlfriend because of co sleeping, fine. But that's not what happened."]}
