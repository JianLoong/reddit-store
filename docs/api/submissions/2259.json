It\u2019s her first time ever in New York City, and it\u2019s expensive for a week\u2019s stay at a hotel so I said she could stay with me the whole time. \n\nMy dad(64) passed away suddenly a month ago. My mom and dad were supposed to surprise me for thanksgiving this year since they\u2019ve never visited me in the 4 years I\u2019ve lived here. My mom still wants to do this despite him passing.  \n\nI have a roommate (29F) who I\u2019ve known since childhood and have lived with her for 9 years. She\u2019s also lived with my family during covid lockdown and when we\u2019ve been in-between apartments. She\u2019s family at this point. \n\nBut she\u2019s having an issue with my mom staying at our apartment for a week. She says this is her safe space and that we would be invading it. She\u2019s yelled about it, begged me to go back to a California for a week instead, and had told me she does not want my mom staying here. She\u2019s even suggested getting a hotel instead even though she knows how expensive it is during the holidays. I told her that my mom and dad have cared for her in their home so that\u2019s not fair. I don\u2019t mean to hold that against her, but now that money is tight after my dad\u2019s expenses (who knew it was so expensive to die in America) I don\u2019t want my mom to worry about spending on a hotel when she could stay free with me. Also with my dad passing, I know my mom just wants to be with me and spend as much time with me as possible since I haven\u2019t lived in their home since I was 18. My mom wants to spend this time with me before she goes back to an empty home. \n\nI feel bad for making my roommate feel like she can\u2019t have her own safe space in her own home. But it\u2019s my home too and I want to share that with my mom while she\u2019s here. Soo.. AITA for not being considerate of how my roommate feels?\n\nINFO: \nMy roommate doesn\u2019t want my mom to stay here because she feels like she\u2019ll be losing privacy. She thinks my mom is going to judge how we live, even though my mom has never stayed with us before. Also, my mom and roommate have a great relationship though. They talk to each other when either one of them is having a problem with me actually. \nI have tried asking my roommate what the problem is exactly, and she either yells about it and doesn\u2019t elaborate. She\u2019s said \u201cwhat does it matter to you?\u201d When I\u2019m genuinely asking her what the problem is so I could make it easier for her. She doesn\u2019t ever give me a straight answer.\n\nEdit: \nI have my own room  my mom would sleep in and my own bathroom. Since she\u2019s never been to nyc I know we\u2019re gonna spend most of the time away from our apartment. My roommate also does not work from home.", "created_utc": 1668374754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuetvy/aita_for_letting_my_mother_stay_with_me_for_a_week/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Info: Has your roommate said why this wouldn\u2019t be a safe space any longer?

Your roommate has something going on she\u2019s not telling you about and is making up excuses. In a shared space, your safe space is your room, not the entire apartment. I assume she has her own room. It\u2019s also partially your apartment and given that your mom provided for her when she didn\u2019t have to, she can put up with a week of that", "Info needed: were there issues when she lived with your parents? Did things end on a less than positive note? If she\u2019s like family and lived with your mom before why would it not be \u201csafe\u201d when your mom visits? Edited to add NTA. It sounds like your roommate has a bigger problem and needs help before she spirals out of control. Tell her that while you understand her position you aren\u2019t willing to kick your grieving mother out so she can continue the self destruction of drinking.", "NTA. Yes it\u2019s sacrifice and hardship and you lose a bit of privacy when someone stays at your house.   She\u2019s known your mom most of her life, she knows she just lost her husband , she has housed your friend in the past.   \n\nIf your friend can\u2019t do you AND your mother a favor for ONE WEEK, she\u2019s not the friend you claim ie \u2018she\u2019s family at this point\u2019\u2026nope", "Info: did something happen between your roommate and your mom? Has she never had a houseguest?", "NTA but even though you thought you had a better relationship with your friend you\u2019re finding out it was more one way. Your roommate was ok with things being done for her and your parents hospitality but she doesn\u2019t feel like she owes you anything,\nSadly since you share an apartment and expensed she is within her rights. I would let her know exactly how you feel and I would start looking for a new roommate if that is possible. But either way to me, this friendship is over and hopefully she\u2019ll never need anything from you again", "Not enough info: Honestly this is very strange. Something must have happened between your mom and roommate considering the reasons she has given you.", "NTA\n\nI would expect a family member to stay with me in my home for short visit. That is not unusual or unreasonable. I would tell the roommate, my mother is staying.\n\nThe roommate's adamant refusal is not reasonable. They're hiding something. Given the history they should be welcoming your mother.", "NAH, though your roommate is overreacting by yelling and tantruming. \n\nThat said, when you live with someone, both have to be on board with houseguests. Why is your roommate so against it? It\u2019s just a week? Did something happen between your mother and the roommate? It seems like a huge reaction for a houseguest that is \u201clike family.\u201d", "INFO why doesn\u2019t roommate want your mom there?", "NTA, your roommate has her own room. You aren\u2019t doing this as a regular thing. I would tell her she can like it or not, and see if she\u2019d rather just get a new roommate, welcome to not having a safe space ever again. One week in all this time is not a big ask. Your Mom should stay in your room each night.", "NTA, probably, unless you're leaving something major out.\n\nFirst of all ideally all of us with homes have our own safe space, our bedrooms, carved out from the public spaces. Unless you share a bedroom,  I fail to see how she would be invaded.\n\nYour mom should share your room, should be able to use common spaces. She or you should ensure she has enough food and drink so your roommate's remain undisturbed. You and your mom should honor your roommate's work schedule.\n\nThis is a normal thing to ask, especially in light of your dad's unexpected passing. The lack of empathy extended to you and your mom for a week together is unbelievably selfish and unexceptable to me, but you may be able to continue the relationship.  \n\nI would ask your roommate to sit down and explain her position to you, and then, repeat it back \"I hear you saying that my mom being here for a week is going to invade your space in X, Y, Z ways. Can we talk about how you see this happening and how we can prevent it?\"\n\n\"My mom cannot afford a hotel, and I have the right to a guest visiting just like you. It really hurts me that after my family was willing to take you in and care for you as their own, you cannot look at this situation from my eyes, and see why I need to be with my mom so badly right now. We just lost my dad and we need this week together.\"\n\n\"I am going to have her here as is my right, and as I told you, we can't afford anything else. To make this as painless on you as possible I'd like to make a table (take out paper or laptop or whatever) and make a 3 column table. Label each column yes, no, deal breakers. Then fill in each section together, making a list of boundaries, and stick with them.\"\n\n Only agree to things that are \"within normal limits\" as we say in the medical world,  and within reason. If it's unreasonable,  don't agree to it, bc you won't stick to it and you'll create a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nPlz update.\n\nI'm very sorry regarding the loss of your father, and hope you and your mother can find comfort together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She acting like an entitled BRAT.", "NTA\n\nThat is your home and safe space as well, and you have every right to have your mom come stay for a week. \n\nEspecially since you have tried several times to get a reasonable excuse out of your roommate on why she don't want her to stay there. \n\nIf they get along so well then it makes no sense.\n\nBut after seeing your comment on the roommate grieving and drinking so much, and not wanting your mom to see that, is not a good excuse.

I think the real problem is that your roommate actually likes your mom, and is afraid that she will be judged / your mom won't like her anymore. But that is her problem.

Your desire to have your mother stay for a week seems fair and kind. Try talking to your roommate more to see what particular issues she might have and if there is any way to accommodate for them (like will your mother be cooking and eating with you both -don't do it if that's a problem, or have your mother stay in your room and you sleep on the couch so she's not in the public space, etc.).", "NTA", "NAH\n\ni get both sides. maybe ask her to split the cost of a hotel?  if you explain that money's tight after your dad died a month ago i think a reasonable person would try to understand.\n\nthe fact that she's stayed with your family before is different.  they're a generation above, have been independent adults much longer, probably a family home vs an apt in nyc (which unless you're rich, and judging from the rest of the story you aren't, is probably tiny).  etc", "Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss OP. \n\nI'm going to go with NTA, but I would want to know more about your room mates objections, specifically why she feels it wouldn't be a safe space. Do you think she is possibly afraid of being surrounded by grief? Does it bring up anything from her own past?\n\nI too would find this particularly hurtful if I were in your situation, given the kindness extended by your family to your friend.

I mean it\u2019s only a week. I agree it\u2019s your right to have a visitor for a week, but have another conversation with your friend and ask what compromises you can make to help her have personal space. Perhaps your mother could sleep in your room instead of the couch?", "NAH--tentatively.\n\nI do think, as a general rule, roommates should always ask about having a guest, definitely if it's more than overnight. I also think the point that they have \"cared for her\" in her home is not really relevant. But I also understand you wanting your mom to stay, especially under the circumstances.\n\nThis also seems to me like your roommate is having a reaction significantly past just being annoyed and inconvenienced--can you sympathetically, non-judgmentally, talk to her about why? That means without jumping in with explanations/arguments like she and your mom have gotten along fine, it's only a week, etc--just listen and see if there are any compromises that could be made--that you and your mom will be out of the apartment certain hours so she can depend on some alone time? your mom spending half the visit at the apartment and half in a hotel (possibly also with you)? that you will be responsible for doing a deep clean/tidying before your mom comes?\n\nAlso, I would ask your roommate if there is anyway it would be helpful to have your mom involved in this conversation--don't repeat private info to her without permission, but if she and her roommate are close, maybe there is a conversation they can have. Honestly, if your mom knows your roommate is deeply uncomfortable--and I'm betting she would pick up on it pretty soon if you go ahead as planned--that may put a significant damper on her ability to enjoy the experience. I certainly wouldn't want to stay in a house where my presence was causing someone else distress, whether or not their distress was \"reasonable.\" (I like to think it wouldn't be, I'm nice!

It is a shared space. Your mother needs to respect that", "YTA. You offered w/o even discussing w/ your roommate. That alone makes you TA.", "YTA.  Everyone deserves to feel comfortable & respected in their own home.  Your roommate openly told you how she felt, you have to respect that & her privacy.  I could understand your mom staying over 1 or 2 nights, but a whole week really is too much.  Just make sure that your roommate knows that the same goes for her, if you can't have your mom stay over for a week, then she can't have people stay over for a week either.

That said, she can plan to spend her \"drunk\" time in her room to avoid the embarrassment of her own making.", "I think you are right about the roommate being afraid that your mother would judge her drinking. It is natural to try and keep that private. If her drinking really has become regular (chronic?) I am sure she does not want your mother to witness it. NTA for allowing your Mom to stay with you in NYC, especially considering the history between all of you.", "I would say NTA. \nMaybe roommate was counting on you going home and having the apartment to herself? Or maybe she is dealing with something that she is afraid will come out with an extra person. \n\nHave a conversation with your roommate and see what you both can do to make the visit better/easier for her?  Let her know that you understand she upset but your with your dad dying you and your mom need this time together and someplace without all the memories. \n\nHotels in NYC are really expensive, especially around holiday times, your roommate should know that and that it\u2019s not possible for you to pay for one this year.", "So be it then.
