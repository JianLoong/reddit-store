I am one of those people that if someone pays for something for me it stays on my mind until I have paid them back. Even if someone buys me a drink or a meal I will make sure I remember that next time it is my turn. Not everyone is like that. Some of my husband and I's finances are separate and on big purchases we often go halvies.

He isn't taking advantage of me, our brains just work differently.", " \"I put it on my credit card, so whenever.\"\n\nyou told him whenever....and now ur pissed when its only been a few days so why be an asshole for telling him that and not even asking when u can expect to be paid back?  remember this whole thing was your idea u should have made clearer expectations before booking.", "YTA. There are these things called words. You should get to know them and how to use them?", "YTA. Just ask him for the money instead of being mad at him. He might just forgot or his transaction was declined. It is no use, if you are mad at him. Except you were not able to enjoy the drip. You won't get your money back because of being mad. You won't get over it by just being mad. And you can't apprciate what he has done for you during this trip, because you are focused on the booking costs.\n\nYes, if he has no intention to pay you back, you might have to have a serious talk.

It being a few days after the trip and doing this is unhinged.", "[deleted]", "Or maybe he was abducted by aliens, had his memory wiped of the whole trip and they also stole his wallet so he can't pay her even if he knew about it.\n\nBasically you have no why he didn't pay but the most likely is he is trying to avoid it.  If you are right and it was due to money issues why wasn't he upfront with her about it and why did he go on a trip agreeing to pay his share but in reality had no way of paying her back?", "We don't know the situation. Presumably he can't even afford to have his car serviced in the past year, so he might be living paycheck to paycheck, which is quite understandable in this economy.", "Why is that the most likely situation? In this economy? When the debtor said 'whenever'? Having a tight budget and having to wait until the next paycheck is not the same as having no way of paying her back. \n\nFor example, all of my bills are due at the beginning of the month. It eats up almost the entirety of a paycheck, with just a little left over for necessities. I keep a very strict budget, the only non-necessity I pay for is internet. If my girlfriend wants to take a trip around that time, she pays for it, and I cover my half when my mid-month paycheck comes in. \n\nThis exact scenario has happened to me, except my girlfriend wasn't pyscho like OP. She asked me when I would be able to pay for it, and I paid her when my paycheck came in. It's called a partnership. \n\nThe OP indicated to her BF that she wanted a partnership, and said he could pay whenever, but it's been \"a few days\" and she is mad enough to consider breaking up without even trying for further communication.\n\nYou immediately started off by assuming the BF to be mooching off of OP. Given the information available in the OP and the state of the world we live in currently, it's more likely that it's waiting on a budget, given that he was told 'whenever'. There is no indication at all that he is \"trying to avoid it\".", "Given the information posted by OP at the time she booked and paid for it he told her he would definitely pay her back.  He had money to pay for fuel and food while they were away so at least has some cash.\n\nThe most likely reason I think he is hoping she will forget about it is that he hasn't brought it up with her to say he will pay her back.  If I was on a trip where someone else paid and I agreed to reimburse them for my half I would be very open with them about when I can and will give them the money.  He hasn't done this and while I think OP is daft for not asking him directly it is very rude of him not to tell her when he is going to pay her.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is broke in the current financial crisis.  If he doesn't have the money he should have been upfront with her before hand to ask for her to pay for it all or declined the trip."]}
