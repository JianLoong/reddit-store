In this economy? When the debtor said 'whenever'?

It eats up almost the entirety of a paycheck, with just a little left over for necessities. I keep a very strict budget, the only non-necessity I pay for is internet.

It's called a partnership. \n\nThe OP indicated to her BF that she wanted a partnership, and said he could pay whenever, but it's been \"a few days\" and she is mad enough to consider breaking up without even trying for further communication.\n\nYou immediately started off by assuming the BF to be mooching off of OP.

If I was on a trip where someone else paid and I agreed to reimburse them for my half I would be very open with them about when I can and will give them the money.  He hasn't done this and while I think OP is daft for not asking him directly it is very rude of him not to tell her when he is going to pay her.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is broke in the current financial crisis.
