Basically, he wants a new car, stereotypically, he want something a Tesla, which he absolutely doesn\u2019t need. He wants us to move in together and for me to buy a house with a pool.

Instead of accepting that what you do is 100% your choice (and that you have a smart plan) he has started bullying you & gotten your friends to join him.

He seems to feel like HE won the lottery and you're denying him HIS winnings. This is going to continue and get worse. I'd say cut him loose, but if you want to stay with him, let him know how unacceptable it is that he thinks it's his money, and how you don't think he's making responsible plans.

It's your absolute right to talk to your financial advisors. I would be EXTREMELY wary of letting boyfriend move in at all. Marriage to this person means he gets half of your money, which is probably exactly what he wants. It's probably time to cut ties with these people, unfortunately. \nCongratulations OP!", "NTA - You do not deserve this. He's cunning and selfish. When you would not comply he told your friends; something you did not want. If you do not set a boundary or cut him off, his tactics will increase and expand.

I wouldnt buy so much mfor someone i have date for such a short time. If its a 2 or 3 or 4 year relationship its different. I also wouldnt buy my family houses ( id pay for the rest of my grandma house tho) but thats just me and i never had any support from my familly. You always should try and see what the person youre helping would do if it was the other way around.  Please dont give him anything that you dont feel confortable with. Also he doesnt need a tesla, some of us would just want a car that works, a tesla is just a show off. Also congrats on your winning. Wish i could be lucky like that even if it was the 10th or 20th prize i would be happy. Hope your life gives you the light on what to do he is a walking red flag demanding stuff like that.", "NTA. Ditch the boyfriend ASAP. Don't buy him a pack of gum, let alone anything else. He's trying to manipulate you with guilt (\"If you loved me...\") and by telling mutual friends about your money. I'm so happy for you, using your money so well!", "NTA. Stick to your original plan. Makes no sense to spend on unnecessary items. Also, he wants you to buy a house with a pool? What is he contributing to this purchase? Smh. 7 months is not a very long time. Consider if this is really the person you want your life with. He's doesn't seem to have any financial sense and is likely to spend frivolously if he thinks you'll be there to just buy everything. That's a one sided relationship so probably best to end it now if he keeps insisting on these purchases.", "NTA. I think it is time to break up with your boyfriend. If he is acting like this with a windfall, imagine when something bad happens.", "NTA, and just my two cent advice.\n\nWhile no one is entitled to your money.  Since you sound like a generous person if I was in your shoes, I'd start figuring out who is sincerely asking for help, and would be gracious.\n\nAnd who is asking for what they want, and will always want more.\n\nThere's a huge difference between the two, people of the first mindset you have the option of helping, and while you'll never get paid back monetarily you'll at least get goodwill from them.  Where as those of the second mindset no matter how much you give them they'll want more, and more, and you'll only get scorn from them for not doing more even if you give into them until your bankrupt.\n\nKudos to you for knowing the value, and need for a financial advisor.", "NTA. Ditch your boyfriend. Ditch your so-called friends. You\u2019re being very smart about this & being very generous to the people who are most important in your life.", "NTA. He\u2019s just a bf and of only 7 months at that. Even if you buy these things for him (which you absolutely shouldn\u2019t), he can easily just leave you afterwards with his stuff. \n\nYou two are not in any committed relationship and it\u2019s way too early for all of that. He absolutely is using you and has just now started talking about all of this once he realized he can get stuff out of it. \n\n\nPlease, please do not give in to your bf or friends. They are not looking out for your best interest in the slightest!", "NTA Just 7 months and he just makes demands. Haha. That he also spread the news of your win... He behaves as if it is his money. Well, i bet he thinks it is his money. You need to end it. He just see the $$$, he doesn't care about you anymore. \n\nCongrats for your win! Don't let others tell you what to do with it. Your plan sound great. Be careful - greed is dangerous.", "NTA Money makes people crazy. You are 100% doing the right thing. DO NOT GIVE IN. The last thing you want to do is waste this money. And I know it\u2019s not this simple, but this man does not love you. This is not how one treats someone they love. I highly recommend reassessing your relationship. He might not be the one.", "NTA - Drop your boyfriend immediately - he is not respectful in any way and getting his friends to haress you puts up every red flag. Is where you live secure? Does he have key? you have the money to move to a place that is secure where he cannot approach you. Just cleanly break it off and go NC.", "NTA. Save your money! You don\u2019t owe anybody anything. Don\u2019t let them make you feel guilty about it. If you give everybody what they want, your money will soon be gone, and NONE of them will care about what happens to you then.
