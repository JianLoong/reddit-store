Also he doesnt need a tesla, some of us would just want a car that works, a tesla is just a show off. Also congrats on your winning.

What is he contributing to this purchase? Smh. 7 months is not a very long time. Consider if this is really the person you want your life with.

Since you sound like a generous person if I was in your shoes, I'd start figuring out who is sincerely asking for help, and would be gracious.\n\nAnd who is asking for what they want, and will always want more.\n\nThere's a huge difference between the two, people of the first mindset you have the option of helping, and while you'll never get paid back monetarily you'll at least get goodwill from them.  Where as those of the second mindset no matter how much you give them they'll want more, and more, and you'll only get scorn from them for not doing more even if you give into them until your bankrupt.\n\nKudos to you for knowing the value, and need for a financial advisor.", "NTA.
