You always should try and see what the person youre helping would do if it was the other way around.  Please dont give him anything that you dont feel confortable with. Also he doesnt need a tesla, some of us would just want a car that works, a tesla is just a show off. Also congrats on your winning.

What is he contributing to this purchase? Smh. 7 months is not a very long time. Consider if this is really the person you want your life with. He's doesn't seem to have any financial sense and is likely to spend frivolously if he thinks you'll be there to just buy everything.

Since you sound like a generous person if I was in your shoes, I'd start figuring out who is sincerely asking for help, and would be gracious.\n\nAnd who is asking for what they want, and will always want more.\n\nThere's a huge difference between the two, people of the first mindset you have the option of helping, and while you'll never get paid back monetarily you'll at least get goodwill from them.  Where as those of the second mindset no matter how much you give them they'll want more, and more, and you'll only get scorn from them for not doing more even if you give into them until your bankrupt.\n\nKudos to you for knowing the value, and need for a financial advisor.", "NTA.

You've been dating this man for 7 months - frankly, it's astonishing that he would think you would spend anything at all on him. Your plans are solid - stick to them. This guy will rip through YOUR winnings in a matter of weeks if you let him. It \\*IS\\* YOUR money. Set clear boundaries that while you are respectfully willing to listen to how he thinks you should spend your money, you are under NO obligation to do so.\n\nIf he doesn't back off from 'what he needs' when you are clear on this point, it may well be time to move on.

You are doing exactly what I would do. I have a degree in finance and worked in wealth management for a number of years (as a meager starving college student) and it was a real eye opener in terms of how absolutely horrible people can get when money is involved. Get some trusts set up for the benefit of your family and for asset protection for yourself.\n\nBut maybe dump the boyfriend, you know? He insulted you and violated your trust to manipulate you because he wanted material things. He felt entitled to it.

Firstly, on your win, very obviously, huge congratulations.\n\nSecondly, you clearly have a good head on your shoulders and are not getting carried away by your windfall. You are taking very sensible steps to securing your and your family's future. That is a very nice gesture, and I hope your family appreciate you.\n\nThirdly, and this is really great, you are only 7 months into a relationship with dipsh*t. I'm amazed he has the gall to be demanding anything of you at this stage, but perhaps we should be grateful that he isn't going for the long con.

That's not even a long-term relationship yet. And his sudden desire to advance the relationship is definitely suspicious.  Honestly sounds like he is trying to mooch it all off you.\n\nI think you need to evaluate your relationships with everyone, because now that it's out in the w world. You going to have long lost friends pop up for a while. \n\nIt's okay to celebrate your own, but anyone pressuring you to spend recklessly, when you have explained your plans are probably financially irresponsible and immature.", "NTA, dump him.", "NTA.\n\nThe main reason marriages fall apart is arguments over money.

Get a burner phone to use in the meantime as well, and turn your regular phone off and only turn it on to check your messages every couple of days. Only give the burner phone number to your financial advisor, lawyer and accountant, use it only to communicate with them for as long as it takes to get yourself set up.\n\nThe reason for this is so that friends and family can't corner you and pressure you into giving them money, which will happen sooner or later.

I dunno what country you are in so the words may be slightly different where you are, but at the start of your meeting with your financial advisor the FIRST thing you inquire about is if they have a *fiduciary duty* to you or not. Fiduciary duty means they are bound by the rules of their profession to always look out for your best interest above their own. They cannot direct you to higher fee accounts that would benefit them over you, etc. *Only* do business with someone who has a fiduciary duty to you when managing your newfound wealth. \n\nSecond, contact a lawyer as well. Have the lawyer walk through various possible outcomes from family and friend fallout and how to handle them from a legal perspective. You are going to have some in the near future unfortunately, with \"friends\" who feel entitled to your money. Your current BF is an excellent example. \n\nFinally, tailored clothes. You might not realize the difference it will make in your appearance if you haven't used it before, but of all the \"vanity\" purchases you could make always looking good is more than just a vanity. People will take you more seriously. Plus you will look amazing. Fancy labels and designer brands can be a bit of a waste so only indulge if that fits your fancy, but clothes that always fit *just right* is more than a statement. \n\nGood luck to you!

Right now it's just manipulation but soon he will try harder and in harder ways to figure out or fight. \n\nNever allow ANYONE to manipulate your out of your money.

Breakup with this moocher already !", "NTA\n\nWell lucky for you not only did you win the lottery your bf also showed his true colors. That's not a person you should consider even being with. Trying to emotionally manipulate you into buying him very expensive things with the \"if you loved me\" bullshit. Refusing to take no for an answer and constantly harrassing you over it, then outing your secret to others to try and further pressure you (and honestly a dangerous thing to do as when it comes to lottery winning people literally get killed for these things).

Your boyfriend immediately thought about himself once the money was involved. He also clearly showed that he believes you being no kids is a phase when he talked about having children in the future.

He is obvious more into your money than your love, wellbeing or future.", "NTA.\nI truly don't understand how you can't see he is using you? Like why do you even have to ask if you're the asshole?

Those who don't ask or expect anything. All others are fakes, I am sorry.\n\nPlease do not do as your boyfriend asks. Speak to your advisor before spending anything.

Wtf", "The kid thing is the reason that jumped out to me the most too. Greed can mess with peoples' heads, and you may be able to forgive and move on from that if they get their head back on straight, but now that she knows he wants kids and she doesn't, there's no way they have a long term future together.", "Does he even really want kids?  Or is he thinking a child will anchor this rich woman to me for the next 18 years.", "That's a really interesting story, especially the forensics. Sad and disturbing, but interesting."]}
