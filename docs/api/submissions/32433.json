Recently my mom's partner has let me know that my mom has been out all night and not returning till 3-4 am which is unusual behavior. My mom's partner recently had back surgery and while she is good, she does need help with things here and there as she cannot lift things over 5lbs yet. \n\nSo I am currently out of town for work and I got a text from my mom last night that she needs me to book a hotel room for just her as she \"needs a break\" I declined as I know my mom's partner needs help still. My mom decides to not heed my advice and still leaves the house. She goes by her office for a bit and then goes to a local hotel. However, my mom's partner and I suspect she is being unfaithful. This morning my mom's partner texted me a picture of my mom leaving a hotel with a guy, who is none other than an ex-flame of mine who I was with briefly when I was 18 but honestly was in love with him until I was 20-21. \n\nMy mom's partner called my mom out on her infidelity which led them to break up.

I do want her to be happy but why HIM? My extended family thinks I was in the wrong and her cheating was inevitable since \"women are not supposed to be in a relationship with each other\" my mother has torn apart my family and I'm just so sad.

It's a diagnosis that gets thrown around a lot when people just mean 'asshole', and she sure is that too, but her behavior does actually seem like literal narcissism. Especially because she wasn't happy with only cheating, but wanted her *daughter* to book the hotel room and needed to tell you afterwards that your ex 'preferred' (lol/yuck) her. That's a classic narcissistic attempt at 'winning' a 'competition' with her daughter that only she is competing in and which really only makes sense from the perspective of a personality disorder. You probably have a lot of stuff from your upbringing to unpack, because narcissism is usually lifelong even if she hasn't been this egregious before. \n\nI'd recommend reading up on narcissism, there are even some great books about narcissistic mothers - off the top of my head I'm thinking 'Will I Ever Be Good Enough' by Karyl McBride, 'Mothers Who Cant Love' by Susan Forward, and 'Youre Not Crazy Its Your Mother' by Danu Morrigan. Maybe find a therapist specializing in childhood emotional neglect and narcissism if that's an option for you (it's important that they have that specialty, since a lot of therapists are still a bit in the dark ages about parent/child relationships).

When we were young we wished we were older. When we're older and as the older we get we find ourselves wishing we were younger again. Young men desire older women older women desire young men. Older men desire young women and so yi women desire older men to an extent society's social acceptance keeps a certain regulation that seems to govern.

Ew. \n\nWould you be okay if your DAD slept with one of your old girlfriends? \nAnd then said to you; I bet I make her scream louder than you did! \n\nNo. You wouldn\u2019t -Cos that\u2019s effed up!", "fair enough but I also hate that they never can get a break from me lol, I am a lot", "No, she was def 100% with her partner they were solid. These last few years have been bumpy. Also, my ex was with his HS sweetheart they broke up a few months before he and I got together.", "Keep her! My whole extended family kept my uncle in our lives after he & my aunt got divorced.", "Keep that one.\n\nBirth momma was a dud :/", "Thank you! It is called common decency.
