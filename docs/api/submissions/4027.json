They just terrify me.\n\nMy husband loves cats and had one of his own during his childhood. \n\nHe knows how afraid I am of them though and will \u201cprotect\u201d me everytime we visit someone that has a cat. He understands my fear and decided pretty early on that he prefers me to having a cat. \n\nHis sister can not comprehend this. She\u2019s always talking about how unfair and selfish I\u2019m being and that her brother deserves to have a cat. I just ignore her. \n\nOne thing she\u2019s started to do is tell my kids how great cats are and how they\u2019re missing out and should beg me to get them one. My kids are very young and easily influenced and have been asking me for a cat for weeks now. I almost gave in and visited my sister in law to try and pet her cat but I freaked out and had a panic attack the second it looked at me. \n\nWell we were having dinner at my sister in law\u2019s house. The cat was playing with the kids while the adults were sitting in the living room. I was stuck to my husband as simply knowing that a cat is in my area makes me feel sick.  \n\nAll of a sudden my son calls me over saying that he needs me. He was in this small storage sort of room for some reason. Obviously I go inside and he starts giggling and then something brushes past me and it was the cat. I was fucking terrified and screamed. I began to cry, hyperventilate and I can\u2019t even remember what happened. I almost vomited too but my husband heard and helped.\n\nTurns out, my sister in law decided it would be funny to make my kid think that pranking me with the cat would be funny. Obviously it wasn\u2019t. She thought it was though and tried giving my son a high five for doing a good job. \n\nI was just so over it and I ended up telling my SIL that I hate her and her stupid fucking cat and that she\u2019s no longer allowed around my kids. She immediately started to cry and said that she just thought my fear of cats was silly and that if she made my kids show me, then I\u2019d be more understanding. She didn\u2019t think I\u2019d act like that in front of my kids (like I can control my reaction??). She said that she understands me hating her but I\u2019m being unfair for not letting her see her nephews. \n\nI just told her that she has her cat. She\u2019s been really upset and has called me everything you can think of. My mil is asking that I think about this some more and that I should cut her some slack. AITA for my harsh response to her \u201cprank\u201d?\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, I have tried therapy and have done things such as figuring out the root cause, discussing reasons, setting short term goals, helpful techniques etc etc. I really wanted to fulfill my husband\u2019s dream of having a cat. But while I got some useful information, I still cannot touch cats or be too close to them. I can be in their presence now though! \n\nAnd I cannot do exposure therapy.

Clearly your SIL does not possess the basic skills on how to treat people decently. Not only has she trampled all over your repeated and consistent boundaries, but she also used your son to cause you trauma. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d leave my child with her. She cannot be trusted.", "NTA.

When you\u2019re legitimately terrified of something, you don\u2019t deserve to have someone make a fool out of you and to embarrass you like this because they consider it a joke. It\u2019s not.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to listen to my advice but I do think it would be beneficial for you to get therapy to help you with ways of coping so you can lessen your anxiety when you encounter a cat, but I do not advise just giving in to your sister and getting a cat because you\u2019re only enabling her shitty behavior and teaching her that if she complains and you get sick of it, you\u2019ll end up giving her what she wants, and that\u2019s not fair to you or your mental health. SIL needs to learn her place. She can have a cat at her home, but she can\u2019t dictate your life and force you to have a cat in your own household.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  SIL knew of your fear and chose to disregard it.  She assumed that she knew better than you what is best for you and your children.  Nobody knows what's best for someone else's kids.

I loooove cats and have four, but your family knows you have a legit PHOBIA. All this does is traumatize you and set you back on any progress you may have made.

Your phobia is teetering on debilitating, a therapist may be able to work with you so that you could at least comfortably visit a house with a cat.", "NTA Your SIL is the AH and needs to give you a proper heartfelt apology that shows she understands what she did and has been doing to you and your kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not you breaking up the family, it\u2019s your SIL\u2019s cruel prank at the expense of someone with a deeply ingrained phobia", "NTA. Jesus Christ she tried to *high five* your son after you were panicking and crying? If I tried to prank my mom and she reacted that way *I would be traumatized* because I\u2019d feel so terrible and guilty for doing that to my mom. SIL needs to mind her own business and you\u2019re right that she shouldn\u2019t be allowed you or your kids anymore. \n\nPhobias are serious and a phobia to this degree needs a ton of careful consideration and professional attention. Not some nutjob thinking it\u2019s teehee funny to throw your phobia in your face. Exposure therapy is ONLY effective when the person WITH the phobia CHOOSES to face their fear in a safe environment. SIL literally made everything worse and her behavior was deeply disrespectful and entitled. \n\nAnd if this is how she acts to you having a fear of cats, I\u2019d hate to know how she\u2019d react to any other fear, aversion, boundary, secret, etc etc that comes up. What if one of your kids develops a fear to something that seems \u201ctrivial\u201d\u2014would she pull the same stunt on them?", "NTA.

She manipulated your children in several ways which is a big no to me!", "NTA.\n\nYour phobia is valid. There are tons of phobias out there. Some of them can seem extremely silly to a lot of people.

She refused to be in there alone. I would distract her from them.\n\nNever would I ever prank her with any of them. That is plain cruel. And I know if I had done that I would of gotten my butt tore up and her never wanting to see me again. You are doing the right thing. Do I think you should let her see her nephews? Yes, BUT only after a sincere apology and her actually realizing that your phobia is real and that there are other \"silly\" phobias that are very real and valid.\n\nLike the phobia of porcelain dolls, or dogs! A lot of people find the phobia of dogs silly too. But its not. MIL needs to understand that as well. If SIL gives a real, true, sincere apology and admits that your phobia is not silly or selfish then she can see her nephews.\n\nBut I am curious....How did your son(s) react to your reaction of the prank?

People who actually care for you *will* respect it and help you out when need be. Obviously, SIL does not respect you with this fear.", "NTA.

I am very uneasy with dogs jumping on me, especially large ones.

My mil is afraid of heights\u2026I said it her would yon be ok if I took up up high to a building made you stand by the edge and just said isn\u2019t it beautiful, you\u2019ll be ok? Or someone who is afraid of spiders, let\u2019s sit with spiders on us, no, we wouldn\u2019t.\nMil after I said this ridiculous things finally got it.

If you can find a therapist to help you with this, it may take the fear or some of it away. You don\u2019t need to have them sitting on your lap or petting them, just learning to coexist with them more. \n\nSister will need to accept that you don\u2019t trust her to respect you and taught your child to do something unkind and you need time to decide if she is a safe person for your children to be around. If she doesn\u2019t sincerely apologize\u2026what I did was wrong , I\u2019m so sorry, how can I make this better\u2026than she isn\u2019t getting that what she did was wrong.\n\nEdit- small edit for wording", "No, your sis in law is the asshole in this case!

And including their kid?! Your SIL needs a serious reality check and is a major AH. Your MIL is encroaching on that territory since she doesn't seem to think it's an issue.\r  \n\r  \nI also don't understand why your SIL is making such a big deal out of this cat thing in the first place. You guys not having a cat doesn't effect her life in any way whatsoever. her using your kids to try to manipulate you into getting a cat (by having them beg for one) is totally unacceptable. Sounds like you guys are ready to go NC with her over and I don't blame you.\n\n(Btw we had to have someone come do work outside and he is absolutely terrified of cats too, so it's not just you with a phobia of them. We have four and he got nervous just seeing one on the cat tree through the window).", "NTA. I used to have a debilitating phobia of dogs. It came to a head in my late teens when I ran in front of a car to avoid a dog about half a mile down the road. I had to get a lot of therapy to deal with it but now I like most dogs (loud barking and very aggressive make me nervous but I can cope).\n\nPhobias are awful and anyone who tries to force you to experience your phobia like that is also awful. In addition your SiL traumatized your children with her prank so she is definitely T A.\n\nI woud suggest therapy. Not because you are in any way bad or wrong for your phobia but because it is impacting your quality of life. Being able to be around dogs has been so much better for me than living with my phobia. \n\nI see no issue with cutting off your SiL for now. You can change your mind later but her cruel prank and continued insistence on trying to get you to become a cat person is unfair to you and your family. She needs to learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA. I am a cat lover and I know that there will be tons of people who will hate on you because anyone who isn't an animal lover is always the bad guy.  You are not the bad guy, you have a phobia.  People would be much kinder about it if the animals you feared were insects, rodents, or reptiles. \n\nThe only AH in this scenario is your SIL.  What a jerk thing to do, and if she was really trying to help you, she wouldn't have done this.  \n\nP.S. Obviously, this condition does make your life harder not just for you, but for the folks around you, and please consider treatment for this phobia.  Even if you do, though, I don't think a person goes from a terror of the animal to owning one as a pet.  That's an unreasonable expectation.", "NTA does SIL realize plenty of people lead happy lives never owning a cat? Weird controlling behavior on her part.

I would explain- you massively crossed the line when you decided to try to manipulate my children against me. That is nigh on unforgivable. That you fail to acknowledge what you have done and attempt to make amends accordingly is all the reason I need.  If you wish to know what amends look like.  1)agree to respect my boundary with cats. 2)massive sincere apology to me. 3)massive sincere apology to kids including specific explanation that it was wrong of you to try to convince them of something behind my back. 4)speak to all in-laws and claim responsibility and tell them that they should respect me and that the conflict was all of your making.

It sucks that this is how they had to learn to respect that kind of thing though.\n\nI hope you all (you, kids and husband) are able to move past this.

They found a partner that was ok not having a cat. Her husband could have decided it was a dealbreaker. OP also lets their children have a relationship with her nephews despite there being a cat in the house. A cat is not a fucking shadow. She can take steps to avoid contact.\n\nYou and SIL are entitled. You think you know better than medical professionals. It\u2019s that kind of mentality that causes people to disregard food allergies or religious food restrictions. Even if you don\u2019t understand the phobia you don\u2019t get to call it silly, as if OP wants to have that phobia.

You don\u2019t have to set yourself on fire to keep them warm, especially if they keep throwing water on the flames. \n\nAn apology- especially one that has to be requested/demanded- is a pretty weak consequence, IMO. A NC or LC \u201ctime out\u201d, if you will, would make more of an impression. At the very least, in addition to an apology, SIL would have to agree to stop bringing up how \u201cunfair\u201d it is for husband not to have a cat, and also stop trying to bring the kids into the debate.

She cannot just switch it off once it gets started, it is a physical reaction of terror (including shortness of breath, heart pounding, etc) that lasts far longer than the instant of the initial scare (sometimes HOURS), and OP's SIL manipulated a child into terrifying his own mother that way. SIL doesn't have the excuse of an extreme emotional reaction to excuse her manipulations, she planned it and used her own nephew to scare his mom. She totally deserved what OP said to her in the heat of the moment, AND she deserves a serious side-eye before further allowing her to manipulate OP's kids against their mother."]}
