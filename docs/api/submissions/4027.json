They just terrify me.\n\nMy husband loves cats and had one of his own during his childhood. \n\nHe knows how afraid I am of them though and will \u201cprotect\u201d me everytime we visit someone that has a cat. He understands my fear and decided pretty early on that he prefers me to having a cat. \n\nHis sister can not comprehend this. She\u2019s always talking about how unfair and selfish I\u2019m being and that her brother deserves to have a cat. I just ignore her. \n\nOne thing she\u2019s started to do is tell my kids how great cats are and how they\u2019re missing out and should beg me to get them one. My kids are very young and easily influenced and have been asking me for a cat for weeks now. I almost gave in and visited my sister in law to try and pet her cat but I freaked out and had a panic attack the second it looked at me. \n\nWell we were having dinner at my sister in law\u2019s house. The cat was playing with the kids while the adults were sitting in the living room. I was stuck to my husband as simply knowing that a cat is in my area makes me feel sick.  \n\nAll of a sudden my son calls me over saying that he needs me. He was in this small storage sort of room for some reason. Obviously I go inside and he starts giggling and then something brushes past me and it was the cat. I was fucking terrified and screamed. I began to cry, hyperventilate and I can\u2019t even remember what happened. I almost vomited too but my husband heard and helped.\n\nTurns out, my sister in law decided it would be funny to make my kid think that pranking me with the cat would be funny. Obviously it wasn\u2019t. She thought it was though and tried giving my son a high five for doing a good job. \n\nI was just so over it and I ended up telling my SIL that I hate her and her stupid fucking cat and that she\u2019s no longer allowed around my kids. She immediately started to cry and said that she just thought my fear of cats was silly and that if she made my kids show me, then I\u2019d be more understanding. She didn\u2019t think I\u2019d act like that in front of my kids (like I can control my reaction??). She said that she understands me hating her but I\u2019m being unfair for not letting her see her nephews. \n\nI just told her that she has her cat. She\u2019s been really upset and has called me everything you can think of. My mil is asking that I think about this some more and that I should cut her some slack. AITA for my harsh response to her \u201cprank\u201d?\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, I have tried therapy and have done things such as figuring out the root cause, discussing reasons, setting short term goals, helpful techniques etc etc. I really wanted to fulfill my husband\u2019s dream of having a cat. But while I got some useful information, I still cannot touch cats or be too close to them. I can be in their presence now though! \n\nAnd I cannot do exposure therapy.

Clearly your SIL does not possess the basic skills on how to treat people decently. Not only has she trampled all over your repeated and consistent boundaries, but she also used your son to cause you trauma. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d leave my child with her. She cannot be trusted.", "NTA.

When you\u2019re legitimately terrified of something, you don\u2019t deserve to have someone make a fool out of you and to embarrass you like this because they consider it a joke. It\u2019s not.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to listen to my advice but I do think it would be beneficial for you to get therapy to help you with ways of coping so you can lessen your anxiety when you encounter a cat, but I do not advise just giving in to your sister and getting a cat because you\u2019re only enabling her shitty behavior and teaching her that if she complains and you get sick of it, you\u2019ll end up giving her what she wants, and that\u2019s not fair to you or your mental health. SIL needs to learn her place. She can have a cat at her home, but she can\u2019t dictate your life and force you to have a cat in your own household.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  SIL knew of your fear and chose to disregard it.  She assumed that she knew better than you what is best for you and your children.  Nobody knows what's best for someone else's kids.

I loooove cats and have four, but your family knows you have a legit PHOBIA. All this does is traumatize you and set you back on any progress you may have made.

Your phobia is teetering on debilitating, a therapist may be able to work with you so that you could at least comfortably visit a house with a cat.", "NTA Your SIL is the AH and needs to give you a proper heartfelt apology that shows she understands what she did and has been doing to you and your kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not you breaking up the family, it\u2019s your SIL\u2019s cruel prank at the expense of someone with a deeply ingrained phobia", "NTA. Jesus Christ she tried to *high five* your son after you were panicking and crying? If I tried to prank my mom and she reacted that way *I would be traumatized* because I\u2019d feel so terrible and guilty for doing that to my mom. SIL needs to mind her own business and you\u2019re right that she shouldn\u2019t be allowed you or your kids anymore. \n\nPhobias are serious and a phobia to this degree needs a ton of careful consideration and professional attention. Not some nutjob thinking it\u2019s teehee funny to throw your phobia in your face. Exposure therapy is ONLY effective when the person WITH the phobia CHOOSES to face their fear in a safe environment. SIL literally made everything worse and her behavior was deeply disrespectful and entitled. \n\nAnd if this is how she acts to you having a fear of cats, I\u2019d hate to know how she\u2019d react to any other fear, aversion, boundary, secret, etc etc that comes up. What if one of your kids develops a fear to something that seems \u201ctrivial\u201d\u2014would she pull the same stunt on them?", "NTA.

She manipulated your children in several ways which is a big no to me!", "NTA.\n\nYour phobia is valid. There are tons of phobias out there. Some of them can seem extremely silly to a lot of people.

She refused to be in there alone. I would distract her from them.\n\nNever would I ever prank her with any of them. That is plain cruel. And I know if I had done that I would of gotten my butt tore up and her never wanting to see me again. You are doing the right thing. Do I think you should let her see her nephews? Yes, BUT only after a sincere apology and her actually realizing that your phobia is real and that there are other \"silly\" phobias that are very real and valid.\n\nLike the phobia of porcelain dolls, or dogs! A lot of people find the phobia of dogs silly too. But its not. MIL needs to understand that as well. If SIL gives a real, true, sincere apology and admits that your phobia is not silly or selfish then she can see her nephews.\n\nBut I am curious....How did your son(s) react to your reaction of the prank?

People who actually care for you *will* respect it and help you out when need be. Obviously, SIL does not respect you with this fear.", "NTA.

I am very uneasy with dogs jumping on me, especially large ones.

My mil is afraid of heights\u2026I said it her would yon be ok if I took up up high to a building made you stand by the edge and just said isn\u2019t it beautiful, you\u2019ll be ok? Or someone who is afraid of spiders, let\u2019s sit with spiders on us, no, we wouldn\u2019t.\nMil after I said this ridiculous things finally got it. I was fine being around the dog, do not being licked on face of hands and can usually avoid that. \n\nMy point is\u2026your SIl doesn\u2019t believe your fear is real or if it is, it\u2019s no big deal. \nIt\u2019s terrible she involved you child in the prank because it is teaching him not to respect people and their boundaries.\n\nYou are going to come across cats at peoples homes and they won\u2019t always put them in a room for you. If you can find a therapist to help you with this, it may take the fear or some of it away. You don\u2019t need to have them sitting on your lap or petting them, just learning to coexist with them more. \n\nSister will need to accept that you don\u2019t trust her to respect you and taught your child to do something unkind and you need time to decide if she is a safe person for your children to be around. If she doesn\u2019t sincerely apologize\u2026what I did was wrong , I\u2019m so sorry, how can I make this better\u2026than she isn\u2019t getting that what she did was wrong.\n\nEdit- small edit for wording", "No, your sis in law is the asshole in this case!

And including their kid?! Your SIL needs a serious reality check and is a major AH. Your MIL is encroaching on that territory since she doesn't seem to think it's an issue.\r  \n\r  \nI also don't understand why your SIL is making such a big deal out of this cat thing in the first place. You guys not having a cat doesn't effect her life in any way whatsoever. her using your kids to try to manipulate you into getting a cat (by having them beg for one) is totally unacceptable. Sounds like you guys are ready to go NC with her over and I don't blame you.\n\n(Btw we had to have someone come do work outside and he is absolutely terrified of cats too, so it's not just you with a phobia of them. We have four and he got nervous just seeing one on the cat tree through the window).", "NTA. I used to have a debilitating phobia of dogs. It came to a head in my late teens when I ran in front of a car to avoid a dog about half a mile down the road. I had to get a lot of therapy to deal with it but now I like most dogs (loud barking and very aggressive make me nervous but I can cope).\n\nPhobias are awful and anyone who tries to force you to experience your phobia like that is also awful. In addition your SiL traumatized your children with her prank so she is definitely T A.\n\nI woud suggest therapy. Not because you are in any way bad or wrong for your phobia but because it is impacting your quality of life. Being able to be around dogs has been so much better for me than living with my phobia. \n\nI see no issue with cutting off your SiL for now. You can change your mind later but her cruel prank and continued insistence on trying to get you to become a cat person is unfair to you and your family. She needs to learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA. I am a cat lover and I know that there will be tons of people who will hate on you because anyone who isn't an animal lover is always the bad guy.  You are not the bad guy, you have a phobia.  People would be much kinder about it if the animals you feared were insects, rodents, or reptiles. \n\nThe only AH in this scenario is your SIL.  What a jerk thing to do, and if she was really trying to help you, she wouldn't have done this.  \n\nP.S. Obviously, this condition does make your life harder not just for you, but for the folks around you, and please consider treatment for this phobia.  Even if you do, though, I don't think a person goes from a terror of the animal to owning one as a pet.  That's an unreasonable expectation.", "NTA does SIL realize plenty of people lead happy lives never owning a cat? Weird controlling behavior on her part.

I would explain- you massively crossed the line when you decided to try to manipulate my children against me. That is nigh on unforgivable. That you fail to acknowledge what you have done and attempt to make amends accordingly is all the reason I need.  If you wish to know what amends look like.  1)agree to respect my boundary with cats. 2)massive sincere apology to me. 3)massive sincere apology to kids including specific explanation that it was wrong of you to try to convince them of something behind my back. 4)speak to all in-laws and claim responsibility and tell them that they should respect me and that the conflict was all of your making.

I definitely would keep your kids away from her, as she's shown she has zero respect or remorse for the pain she's caused and only cares about herself.", "NTA but no, you aren't incapable of exposure therapy, you are more than welcome to refuse to try it, that is your right, but you are not incapable", "NTA but I hope you will forgive your SIL with time and that SIL will take you seriously from now on.", "NTA phobias are real. I love cats but if someone came to my home with that phobia the cats would spend some time shut in my room for the visit.", "\u201cShe\u2019s called me everything you can think of.\u201d She must not want to see her nephews too badly. Make sure your husband is on the same page as you. NTA", "NTA. I love cats and have 3 house cats. If we were friends or relatives, I would be visiting you and your family somewhere other than my house. It is much easier than stressing you out.", "NTA!\n\nI have a cat I will never do that to someone who is scared of cats! What a cruel thing to do!", "NTA.She did this obviously knowing it might cause a reaction. Anyway, you have to go to therapy, look for a professional that you feel confident with (sometimes what you were may not have been the best for your case, since the success of the therapy is largely due to your connection with the professional), it takes time but cats will exist everywhere, and this fear is not normal. I say this as a person who doesn't like and is afraid of dogs, but luckily I can even pet them now.", "Lmao", "NTA. Ask your MIL if she herself has something she really fears or hates. Ask how she'd feel if someone tricked her small child into scaring her with it. Hopefully she'll get it.", "NTA. I'd stand ground on keeping your kids away from your SIL. She is teaching them to be assholes and cruel.", "This is just so horrible. NTA!! I am a cat lover and owner, but you don\u2019t even need to have a phobia for it not to be okay for someone to shove their pets at you. And you do have one! And she\u2019s seen it before with her own eyes! You were not only tolerating being in a space with a cat, YOU LET YOUR KIDS PLAY WITH ONE! That is huge. Most of the phobia posts on here are all about \u201cdon\u2019t put that on your kids\u201d and you aren\u2019t! You are being super strong and as flexible as you could be despite your fear. Your husband is an adult who has accepted your phobia. Your kids can have cats as adults if they want one, when they live in a home where another resident isn\u2019t terrified of them. Your SIL did a majorly messed up thing and it is totally your right to restrict her access to your kids now that she\u2019s proven she would use them to torment their own mother and that she doesn\u2019t have any empathy for your mental well being or theirs. That had to be scary for them too!", "NTA. That wasn't a prank, that was intentionally cruel. Next time she says your husband needs a cat, say he already has you and show her \"your\" kitten kink gear. That would actually be funny.", "Your SIL is cruel. Your fear of cats is real and it has a profoundly negative effect on you. YOU had a panic attack because of what she did to you. This was not a prank. It was abuse.  Using your children, in effect, weaponizing them, to carry out the prank was abusive as well. She doesn't have the right to be around you or your kids after that.  NTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister in law needs to learn that a phobia for cats is as natural as being afraid of the dark, spiders, snakes, the sea, etc. \nIf she has a phobia, would she think it is a prank to have the phobia thrown in her face? \n\nYour reactions are not just a sign of fear.... they are actually a real sign of a phobia. Ailurophobia. It is not as common as arachnophobia but it is out there. \nAnd having a phobia is not something you \"just\" get over. \n\nYour SIL and MIL are not showing you the respect, making you physical sick and are litteraly setting your kids up against you. \nYour MIL is softer on it, but your SIL is a huge AH. \nShe saw you scream and throw up and still high fived your son. Basically going: Look you made your mother sick. Good job, kid. \nShe is a bad influence on the kid, so she doesn't get to see the kid. I am with you on that. \nShe also might need to speak with a therapist of how serious phobias are and what she did was basically a sociopathic move!\n\nI hope you managed to calm down and again, this is not your fault. If someone would suddenly push me off a ship in deep water, they better hope I drown, because I will not be as friendly as you when I come out of my fear.", "NTA, what if it wasn\u2019t you but your children that had that phobia? Would she do the same to them because \u201cit\u2019s a silly fear\u201d?", "NTA, I think the only way your sister-in-law will understand the severity of her actions is to separate her from the kid\u2019s", "Yikes why would you even go to places with cats if you can\u2019t handle them looking at you. Sounds miserable", "Yes your SIL is an asshole but there is also something else going on here. Your reaction to a cat isn't normal. It's one thing to be fearful of cats because of a phobia and quite another to feel sick that a cat is just in the area. \n\nAnd yes I am aware of phobias and sometimes they can illicit reactions that to others seem way over the top. But there is something else going on that you are not telling us - unless there is a legitimate mental illness at play phobias always have a source.\n\nI'm really not trying to be a dick here because your sister-in-law really did a shitty thing but at the same time you have to appreciate that your reaction to a cat is pretty extreme.", "NTA. Why the hell is it SO IMPORTANT to your SIL that you and your husband have a cat?! You are clearly phobic. The kind thing to do is to stop mentioning cats and to put her cats away while you're over. It's not that hard and it isn't going to hurt them. \n\nThis was a cruel and toxic thing for her to do. So is trying to get your kids to beg you for a cat. Your kids do not need this negative influence around them.", "I was attached by my grandmothers cat when I was really young (still have scars on my leg from it), and was TERRIFIED of cats for years! I eventually got over my fear, but I still don't like cats and prefer to not be near them or in a house with them.  \n\nYour reaction doesn't sound like its from trauma, but a legit phobia.  Sometimes, there is nothing you can do to get rid of or diminish that reaction, and that's okay.  You are absolutely NTA! You told her your limits and she disrespected them, on top of involving your children in the scheme.", "NTA. While definitely not this bad, I have gotten panic attacks due to heights before, and if someone pulled something like this with heights for me, it the first ticket out on the get the fuck out of my life train. Don't let you SIL stay around your kids she will 100% do this again.", "NTA.\n\n\nShe has shown that she is untrustworthy as an individual to be around your children.  \n\n\n\nHowever consider discussing your phobia to your kids at an age appropriate level as well as helping them be empathetic to others phobias.  As well as start an open ended discussion on pranking and how it makes the victim feel and your thoughts and feelings regarding that.", "Nta\n\nI think you need to go low contact for at least 6 months to a year. There have to be consequences. Say she is to be no contact with you or the kids till say June or when ever you see fit and that if she\u2019ll agree at that point to respect you as a person you can move on. \n\nDig in and hold her feet to the fire and make her pay and get your husband to back you.", "NTA.\n\nYour SIL's \"prank\" was cruel. \n\nThat being said, this phobia sounds debilitating. In my unprofessional opinion, I think you should seek therapy just so that you can comfortably enter a house with a cat in it. Obviously, you are not expected to start liking cats or interacting with them.", "As I told her in my comment that she should bill a therapy sessions from the start of the cruel prank to the current day to SIL.", "I like your point that some people don\u2019t seek treatment for them. I found it weird how many people jumped to the \u201cmaybe you need to seek therapy for this\u201d option. Someone with a phobia isn\u2019t required to do that. Yeah it might help some people, but it might not! And it does sound like OP has (from her added comment). She was in a house. With a cat. Letting her kids play with it! I mean honestly she said she was uncomfortable but doing everything so that it wasn\u2019t bad for her kids or avoiding SILs house. Like literally she was doing THE MOST and her SIL pulls this heinous prank. \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t a phobia, people are allowed to not have pets. That is a conversation for her and her husband and their home. If husband is cool with no cats, even if he loves them but knows wife doesn\u2019t want any, then that\u2019s it! The kids get to be adults and have their own pets when they are financially and emotionally responsible for them. It\u2019s not some deprivation that they don\u2019t get one as a kid over their mothers dislike (or fear or whatever - in a non-phobia scenario).", "She says she\u2019s tried therapy", ">Saying she's not allowed around your kids is an overreaction to her making a mistake.\n\nAbsolutely not. Her SIL taught her kids that it's ok to ignore people's fears and play cruel tricks on them. I would not be ok with having a person like this in my child's life. This situation must have also traumatized the kids who saw their mother have a very visceral reaction. SIL thought of nobody but herself.", "Apart from the distress caused to OP, part of the cruelty inflicted by this stupid prank was on the kids. They were told to do it by an adult they trust (SIL) so mummy could see how silly she's being and when the kids did it as suggested, they had to then watch their mother have a mini breakdown from *their* actions. I suspect the kids are also a bit traumatised and possibly feeling horrendously guilty.", "NTA This. NC with SIL, 100% and dont let her near your kids, shes crazy.", "When I was about 20 I had a fog chase me up on top of a car.  I tell you it took about 6 hours for me to stop shaking. So for the next decade I was not trying to get near any dogs. Then started dating a vet tech who loved all animals. When he was recovering from lung cancer and a very serious surgery he really wanted a dog so I relented, and have been a dog mom ever since.", "Wow, that's success! Good job, I bet it wasn't easy.", ">explained the situation to him but he\u2019s been very attached to me since and won\u2019t stop saying sorry.\n\nMake sure your MIL knows how SIL's prank has hurt not only you, but your children as well.  Send them both on a good guilt trip - they deserve it.  (SIL for the prank and MIL for trying to rugsweep it)", "She needs to sincerely apologize,  not just to you, but also your kids for her disturbing and inappropriate behavior. From the way your son is clinging to you it sounds like he may be traumatized as well. It may not hurt to have you and him visit a counselor to discuss what happened and ensure he knows it was not his fault. And explain about phobias in language he will understand. \n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you and your kids. I am a huge cat lover, but can't imagine someone being this shitty and trying to sugarcoat it as a 'prank'. Everyone is afraid of something, and phobias are the ultimate in fear. Doesn't matter what it is or how other people view it, there is no excuse for belittling another person for their fear.  NTA.", "I know right! OP has tried incredibly hard for her husband's sake, and has at last reached the stage where she can at least be around cats. Who knows, this may have slowly improved over the years. SIL has both been incredibly cruel, but also likely set back all OPs work. \n\nI love cats, my children don't, so I've told them I won't get a cat until they're both adults - we make sacrifices sometimes for family, which OPs husband was willingly doing.", "Not to mention the way this sets the kids up to think it's okay to undermine their parents.", "Yeah, if I found this out about my childhood and my parents hadn't cut my contact with this person, I wholeheartedly would myself.", "This will be a lasting memory for the kids.  It is cruel to OP, but it is also very cruel to the kids.", "don't even need to be older I think - your auntie telling you something will be funny and mummy will laugh, and then mummy completely losing it in front of you because you did the thing, could be really upsetting and confusing for a little kid", "There is a very common fear of \"dark\" water or water where you can't see what is in it. I have the dark water fear and it is because I'm afraid something will get me. Maybe a shark, maybe something else, I don't know. I'm fine in water I can see but I won't night swim unless there are lights and I have minimal interaction with our pool while it is covered/winterized.", "I have this same phobia! \n\nAnd I know it's the most ridiculous thing. I'm happy to find out that someone else gets it.", "And just let a bird fly over so that the shadow falls at the bottom of the pool and I'm walkin' on water I am!!", "Mine is heights, mainly ladders without railings, open stairs, and trees.  No freaking clue, but I can feel the panic building on the first step.  Hell, even watching those videos of people hanging out on ledges freaks me out.  SIL is TA.", "Oh yes. Worms, caterpillars, silverfish, slugs, and most of all CENTIPEDES AND MILLIPEDES. Disgusting. \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e I had to tell my nephew when he was younger that if he comes near me with any of the above I (seriously) cannot be responsible for what I might do.", "I think the aversion for maggots is probably more likely to be passed down through generations because their presence in food or food storage could indicate that the food could make you really sick. If people weren\u2019t averse to maggots they might just pick them off and still eat the food. Blegh.", "It must've been horrible for all involved but yes, this was very uncaring and cruel to her own cat! So what kind of person is this? The worst. That kind.", "Wow. I can't even imagine how furious I would be if someone cut my hair off, and it's not nearly that long. Now I'm trying to decide whether I would be angrier about that or if someone tricked me into touching a ~~cat~~ spider.", "how is it negatively affecting her family? they can have literally ANY pet other than a cat. they don't need a cat.", "genuine Q - can you toilet train a free roaming house rabbit? or do they just poop and wee all over the house?", ">Seriously, how do you think a decision like this would age even ten years down the line, let alone 30 when they\u2019ll be adults and have to question why their mother would do something so extreme? \n\nPerhaps they would recognize that their aunt used their innocence to purposely hurt their mother. I don't think they would see their mother's decision to distance themselves from their aunt as a bad decision. Parents are supposed to protect and teach their children how to be good humans. Why would their mother want such a terrible influence in their lives?", "Yeah that's not smart considering that the fear of spiders is pretty common.", "Surely he knew about your phobia?
