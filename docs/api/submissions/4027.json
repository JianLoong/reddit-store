Clearly your SIL does not possess the basic skills of how to treat people decently. Not only has she trampled all over your repeated and consistent boundaries, but she also used your son to cause you trauma. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d leave my child with her.

Your SIL is being unnecessarily cruel, and using your kids to do it.", "If someone used my kids to prank me with anything I had an extreme fear of because they thought my fear was \u201csilly\u201d, I would go off on that person too. When you\u2019re legitimately terrified of something, you don\u2019t deserve to have someone make a fool out of you and to embarrass you like this because they consider it a joke. It\u2019s not.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to listen to my advice but I do think it would be beneficial for you to get therapy to help you with ways of coping so you can lessen your anxiety when you encounter a cat, but I do not advise just giving in to your sister and getting a cat because you\u2019re only enabling her shitty behavior and teaching her that if she complains and you get sick of it, you\u2019ll end up giving her what she wants, and that\u2019s not fair to you or your mental health. SIL needs to learn her place. She can have a cat at her home, but she can\u2019t dictate your life and force you to have a cat in your own household.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  SIL knew of your fear and chose to disregard it.  She assumed that she knew better than you what is best for you and your children.  Nobody knows what's best for someone else's kids.

I loooove cats and have four, but your family knows you have a legit PHOBIA. All this does is traumatize you and set you back on any progress you may have made. If you\u2019re able to, reach out to a therapist that specializes in phobias. There\u2019s nothing \u201csilly\u201d about phobias, including over cats.", "NTA - people have phobias, and those phobias need to be respected. It\u2019s that easy.

Your phobia is teetering on debilitating, a therapist may be able to work with you so that you could at least comfortably visit a house with a cat.", "NTA Your SIL is the AH and needs to give you a proper heartfelt apology that shows she understands what she did and has been doing to you and your kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not you breaking up the family, it\u2019s your SIL\u2019s cruel prank at the expense of someone with a deeply ingrained phobia", "NTA. Jesus Christ she tried to *high five* your son after you were panicking and crying? If I tried to prank my mom and she reacted that way *I would be traumatized* because I\u2019d feel so terrible and guilty for doing that to my mom. SIL needs to mind her own business and you\u2019re right that she shouldn\u2019t be allowed you or your kids anymore. \n\nPhobias are serious and a phobia to this degree needs a ton of careful consideration and professional attention. Not some nutjob thinking it\u2019s teehee funny to throw your phobia in your face. Exposure therapy is ONLY effective when the person WITH the phobia CHOOSES to face their fear in a safe environment. SIL literally made everything worse and her behavior was deeply disrespectful and entitled. \n\nAnd if this is how she acts to you having a fear of cats, I\u2019d hate to know how she\u2019d react to any other fear, aversion, boundary, secret, etc etc that comes up. What if one of your kids develops a fear to something that seems \u201ctrivial\u201d\u2014would she pull the same stunt on them?", "NTA.

She manipulated your children in several ways which is a big no to me!", "NTA.\n\nYour phobia is valid. There are tons of phobias out there. Some of them can seem extremely silly to a lot of people. And they arent. I have a cousin who has a phobia of porcelain dolls. I used to have a lot of them in my room growing up. She would come in and stay but ONLY IF I WAS THERE! She refused to be in there alone. I would distract her from them.\n\nNever would I ever prank her with any of them. That is plain cruel. And I know if I had done that I would of gotten my butt tore up and her never wanting to see me again. You are doing the right thing. Do I think you should let her see her nephews? Yes, BUT only after a sincere apology and her actually realizing that your phobia is real and that there are other \"silly\" phobias that are very real and valid.\n\nLike the phobia of porcelain dolls, or dogs! A lot of people find the phobia of dogs silly too. But its not. MIL needs to understand that as well. If SIL gives a real, true, sincere apology and admits that your phobia is not silly or selfish then she can see her nephews.\n\nBut I am curious....How did your son(s) react to your reaction of the prank? I know you say they are young but they are old enough to understand phobias from thr sounds of it.", "NTA,\n\nYour SIL won the play stupid games get stupid prizes.", "NTA! Omg I love cats but I would never do this on someone who has an extreme fear of them! SIL is a major AH and she doesn\u2019t get to decide whether you get a cat or not, doesn\u2019t matter if \u201chusband needs one.\u201d The fact that she uses your kids as a way to manipulate you into getting a cat is wrong too, along with using them as the cruel \u201cprank.\u201d \n\nEveryone has a extreme fear, I know I have an odd one too. People who actually care for you *will* respect it and help you out when need be. Obviously, SIL does not respect you with this fear.", "NTA.

Then MAYBE she can have supervised visits\u2026in YOUR home.", "NTA\n\nI was bit by a child by a neighbors dog that charged me, jumped on me then bit my hands. I am very uneasy with dogs jumping on me, especially large ones. In laws knew this, large dog would jump on me and start licking. \u201cOh he just likes you\u2019, oh he\u2019s sweet and wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u201d.\nI finally snapped and said you know that this isn\u2019t ok, why can\u2019t you just hold the dogs collar so it doesn\u2019t jump on me or  anything. My mil is afraid of heights\u2026I said it her would yon be ok if I took up up high to a building made you stand by the edge and just said isn\u2019t it beautiful, you\u2019ll be ok? Or someone who is afraid of spiders, let\u2019s sit with spiders on us, no, we wouldn\u2019t.\nMil after I said this ridiculous things finally got it. I was fine being around the dog, do not being licked on face of hands and can usually avoid that. \n\nMy point is\u2026your SIl doesn\u2019t believe your fear is real or if it is, it\u2019s no big deal. \nIt\u2019s terrible she involved you child in the prank because it is teaching him not to respect people and their boundaries.\n\nYou are going to come across cats at peoples homes and they won\u2019t always put them in a room for you. If you can find a therapist to help you with this, it may take the fear or some of it away. You don\u2019t need to have them sitting on your lap or petting them, just learning to coexist with them more. \n\nSister will need to accept that you don\u2019t trust her to respect you and taught your child to do something unkind and you need time to decide if she is a safe person for your children to be around. If she doesn\u2019t sincerely apologize\u2026what I did was wrong , I\u2019m so sorry, how can I make this better\u2026than she isn\u2019t getting that what she did was wrong.\n\nEdit- small edit for wording", "No, your sis in law is the asshole in this case! As for your mom in law talking about you should cut your sis in law some slack, you sis in law need to cut YOU some slack!", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nPranks are usually a bad idea to being with, but using someone's known phobia against them? And including their kid?! Your SIL needs a serious reality check and is a major AH. Your MIL is encroaching on that territory since she doesn't seem to think it's an issue.\r  \n\r  \nI also don't understand why your SIL is making such a big deal out of this cat thing in the first place. You guys not having a cat doesn't effect her life in any way whatsoever. her using your kids to try to manipulate you into getting a cat (by having them beg for one) is totally unacceptable. Sounds like you guys are ready to go NC with her over and I don't blame you.\n\n(Btw we had to have someone come do work outside and he is absolutely terrified of cats too, so it's not just you with a phobia of them. We have four and he got nervous just seeing one on the cat tree through the window).", "NTA. I used to have a debilitating phobia of dogs. It came to a head in my late teens when I ran in front of a car to avoid a dog about half a mile down the road. I had to get a lot of therapy to deal with it but now I like most dogs (loud barking and very aggressive make me nervous but I can cope).\n\nPhobias are awful and anyone who tries to force you to experience your phobia like that is also awful. In addition your SiL traumatized your children with her prank so she is definitely T A.\n\nI woud suggest therapy. Not because you are in any way bad or wrong for your phobia but because it is impacting your quality of life. Being able to be around dogs has been so much better for me than living with my phobia. \n\nI see no issue with cutting off your SiL for now. You can change your mind later but her cruel prank and continued insistence on trying to get you to become a cat person is unfair to you and your family. She needs to learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA. I am a cat lover and I know that there will be tons of people who will hate on you because anyone who isn't an animal lover is always the bad guy.  You are not the bad guy, you have a phobia.  People would be much kinder about it if the animals you feared were insects, rodents, or reptiles. \n\nThe only AH in this scenario is your SIL.  What a jerk thing to do, and if she was really trying to help you, she wouldn't have done this.  \n\nP.S. Obviously, this condition does make your life harder not just for you, but for the folks around you, and please consider treatment for this phobia.  Even if you do, though, I don't think a person goes from a terror of the animal to owning one as a pet.  That's an unreasonable expectation.", "NTA does SIL realize plenty of people lead happy lives never owning a cat? Weird controlling behavior on her part. Tbh though I would be really annoyed if I had to always deal with my in laws phobia of extremely sweet and lovable creatures.", "NTA. \n\nIn my book prank is almost always the horrible thing and person instigating them is the a-hole.\n\nUsing a phobia in the prank - double a-hole move.\n\nMaking your kid part of prank against you - tripple feat. \n\nAnd it's not a case of managing ones fears - some people have phobias. Some phobias are not rational. SOme people seek help, some don't. It does not excuse using phobias against people. It does not excuse scaring people for fun.", "NTA \n\nWow. She\u2019s such an asshole. I think you should take some space. Maybe in 6 months she can try again and you can proceed from there. A hard boundary should be that you never go to her house again. Every time you get a complaint from any one of your in-laws add another month to the time out.", "NTA- prankers are always TA. I would explain- you massively crossed the line when you decided to try to manipulate my children against me. That is nigh on unforgivable. That you fail to acknowledge what you have done and attempt to make amends accordingly is all the reason I need.  If you wish to know what amends look like.  1)agree to respect my boundary with cats. 2)massive sincere apology to me. 3)massive sincere apology to kids including specific explanation that it was wrong of you to try to convince them of something behind my back. 4)speak to all in-laws and claim responsibility and tell them that they should respect me and that the conflict was all of your making.  And then and only then can we even think about backing off.", "Nope nope nope nta. Your sil has just demonstrated she will manipulate your children and use them against you. She is now facing whats called consequences for her actions.", "NTA \n\nGet a dog. Best replacement for an inconsiderate SIL.\n\nEdit: commenters that say, that phobia is silly are also largely in TA territory. One doesn\u2019t decide what you are afraid off, or how you react to beeing confronted with it. I think it\u2019s a big step that you choose to visit a household where your fear is.

Your sister in law is a complete jerk as well as ignorant. If it ever seems like she genuinely gets that she was a bully and completely wrong, you might be able to forgive her and accept her company.

I even had a cat for a while when I was 9 and that didn\u2019t shake my fear. Maybe worsened it. My husband even tried but I just can\u2019t. They creep me out and make me feel sick. I know it\u2019s silly but I really cannot help it.", "Sorry. You don\u2019t decide what is silly. You are close to TA territory for that comment.", "I wouldn't call someone else's fears silly. There isn't a list of fears that are silly or not somewhere, is there?", "What part of this being a phobia do you not understand? If you don\u2019t know what a phobia is, go read the DSM-V.", "The SIL is the one who fractured the family when she decided the appropriate reaction to a phobia was a cruel prank. Phobias aren\u2019t rational and they CAN be managed but this isn\u2019t the way to do it.", "I understand if you think I overreacted but my fear of cats is not affecting my life as some may think it is. Yeah sure my kids will not be able to have a pet cat while they live with me but people grow up without cats all the time and they\u2019re fine. I don\u2019t need to be unafraid of cats for work. When I see a cat on the street, yes I feel their presence and my heart races but I can walk past them without anyone realizing. Yes sometimes I have to visit people who have cats but as long as I don\u2019t look at or feel the cat and breathe consistently, I\u2019m fine-ish.", "It is not an overreaction. SIL is a bad influence for the kids, she is teaching them to be mean and use other people fear to do \u201cprank\u201d. Immagine when the pull this stunt on a classmate with some kind of phobia?\n\nOP will have to deal with the school and the kids will not understand why they are begin suspended.", "Yes! I get phobias, especially ones that seem silly and have no basis (I'm terrified of balloons) but therapy can be a wonderful thing! Especially when your fear is a common object (or animal)! :)", "Your son sounds like he is truly sorry. Poor kid....Your SIL didnt just traumatize you she traumatized your son too. Your phobia is valid. I love all animals except two of them which are bugs. I have an extreme phobia of roaches. Especially the big ones. Like the palmetto bugs we have here where I live.-shivers-Huge FLYING roaches....\n\nMy cousin had small roaches where she lives now and her father lives with her and her husband. I dont like him. Many reasons. But he liked to make me think he picked one up and was fonna put it on me. Yeah no. I get told my fear is silly. The roaches are gone now. Thankfully. But you are valid and her actions do need consequences.\n\nI think maybe do research on phobias and figure out a kid friendly way to explain them to your kids. Maybe something like everyone is afriad of something. And sometimes that fear can cause what is known as a panic attack. And so on..I had to explain my reaction to my nephew about a roach we saw outside when he was young. His mom helped me explain. He was about 8 I think.", "Oh gosh, sounds like this traumatized your kids as much as it did you. \ud83d\ude29 Definitely mention this the next time your MIL nags you about it, what your SIL did upset them too.", "I felt so bad for your son, he was a victim too! Hugs to both of you \u2764\ufe0f", "The comparison was there to show there are many irrational fears. And my apologies I completely forgot, I believe little people is the correct term and the fear is called Achondroplasiaphobia to set the record straight.", "No, but her phobia is negatively affecting her husband and children. She needs to get therapy and not just expect her husband to forever be her wall to protect her from cats. That\u2019s absurd.", "She absolutely sucks for not getting help when her phobia is negatively affecting her family.", "That is a good husband. Your SIL was cruel towards you. Involving your kids in this was so childish.", "Ig that's good\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f All's well that ends well.", "Just because someone tells you that your fear is silly doesn\u2019t mean that it is. It might be silly to them, but mentally, for you, it\u2019s not. Phobias can be debilitating.\n\nI do think therapy could really help you if you try it so that you can start working on lessening the extreme response and your reaction to what you fear. It would be really beneficial to you to start working on it. As much as we want our spouses to protect us from everything, sometimes they can\u2019t and we can\u2019t expect them to. Your husband can only do so much in terms of your mental health. You have to be putting the work in to help yourself too.", "Maybe hypnotherapy would help?", "The fact that you have been afraid of them since you were little and have tried before to fix it does not mean that falling to pieces is acceptable. It\u2019s okay to not like and get grossed out by something but you still have to be able to function. Cats are ubiquitous enough that you need to learn to town down your response to them. CBT therapy is great for this. You don\u2019t need to start loving them but you do need to be able to not collapse if you see on. Otherwise you are unduly burdening others around you.", "I think that deciding that a reaction to a common every day occurrence that pushes someone to the point of screaming and none functioning over exposure to it is not worth deep investments into councaling and cbt therapy is silly.  \n\nThe fact that her trigger is cats is neither here nor there. What is silly is the acceptance of this as a natural part of life. \n\nI probably could have articulated that better.", "It\u2019s not that specific fears are silly, but having such a reaction to a common everyday occurrence that you scream and fall to pieces and deciding \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is\u201d is silly.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I agree that your kids don't need a cat. Personally, I'd want my kids to see me dealing with fear this intense by addressing it head-on, in this case, a phobia like this likely needs professional intervention.", "Dude, I too have blattodeaphobia! I can deal with anything except for roaches, but I live in SC so palmetto bugs are here no matter how clean I am. It\u2019s a therapist diagnosed phobia.\n\n\nOne of my friends pretended to throw a roach on me while a held a wine glass and I shattered the wine glass on the ceiling by accident.", "Some prefer little person, some prefer dwarf. From what I\u2019ve heard, all hate the m-word.", "Phobias aren\u2019t just about being startled or scared. It is a physically and mentally damaging.", "The SIL has been using the children against her, all for the sake of a cat, but it\u2019s the victim\u2019s fault for being deliberately terrified for a \u2018joke\u2019?  The SIL is behaving like a cruel 10 year old bully.", "SIL is actively trying to turn the kids against OP regarding the decision to not get a cat. SIL then engages kids in a prank harming their own mother. That\u2019s disgusting behavior from SIL. OP is not in the wrong for not allowing SIL access to the children, at least for a period of time until it\u2019s clear SIL will not behave like that again.", "[deleted]", "Having a phobia isn\u2019t being an ass. She doesn\u2019t even try to force cat owners to keep them locked away when she\u2019s around. Just not to have them near her. The SIL is the only ass here.", "Sorry but the bully was actually the one that making a split in the family. If sil simple respect op then it never would had happen. There are consequences to your actions and sil is facing them. \n\nNot only was op traumatized but also her son. She mentioned in a comment her son won\u2019t leave her side and keeps saying sorry.", "[deleted]", "The SIL used the kids to intentionally trigger a phobia in OP, to try and downplay actual fear and anxiety so that SIL could get her way and OP's husband could get a pet that he isn't even asking for.\n\nSIL's actions and manipulation of the kids have led to the rift. You do not use children as pawns.\n\nSince you like to repeat things, perhaps to help you remember,  I'll say it again.\n\nYou do not use children as pawns.\n\nNTA, OP."]}
