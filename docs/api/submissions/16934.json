It was going to be difficult to live in the city with all of these animals so I made the decision to buy a small farm so she could keep them.\r  \nThe farm was a lot of work for me, I had a long commute to work, was isolated from friends through distance and my career progression options were limited due to location but overall we were happy. My wife was living her dream life, she wasn\u2019t working and days were spent riding horses, playing with dogs and looking after our two toddlers. I was fortunate that my job was fairly flexible so I had time to look after the farm.\r  \nCOVID happened and I lost my cruisy job. I had to take on two jobs to pay the bills/mortgage. This meant that most of my spare time was spent looking after the farm and I had limited time to play with the kids which was/is my favourite thing to do. I became extremely stressed due to my workload and the uncertainty in my life. I constantly asked my wife for help with chores around the house but rarely did I get the help I needed (She either said she would do it and get to it days later if at all or would straight up get shirty with me as she was relaxing after looking after the kids).\r  \nEventually I became overwhelmed with all of this and had a mental breakdown of sorts. I was barely sleeping and was severely depressed/anxious. My wife finally saw what was going on and decided to sell the farm and move back in to town. At the same time 3 of the dogs died of old age (within 6 months of each other) and we were left with only one. We sold the farm and moved in to town. The wife\u2019s horses were moved to a friends property where they are today. My wife was very supportive throughout this period and gave up her dream life for me.\r  \nI became distant and somewhat resentful of my wife, blaming her at times for everything that happened (Life was never the same, we lost a lot of money selling the farm in the COVID property dip and buying a year later in to the boom, property is an insane obsession where I live). I was particularly hurt by the lies she told me to get these animals which completely upended our life. My wife\u2019s mental health has subsequently gone down hill due losing everything she loved and me being distant/resentful at times.\r  \nSo AITA for ruining my wife\u2019s perfect life?", "created_utc": 1683771220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eacrt/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_perfect_life/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your in a partnership and you had no other choice. Her perfect life should include YOU being happy  and healthy. Yes, you supported her taking in the animals but it\u2019s not the best way to say yes when you really mean no. That brings resentment. You didn\u2019t stick to your boundaries but at the same time she ignored your boundaries which was unfair to you. Having her stay home and not contribute to chores and just have expensive animals all day is not fair to you. There can be a happy medium here. You live in town, and you have your one dog. One dog is enough to love and cherish. You can spend weekends visiting the horses on the farm. This new situation could really help you guys. A happy medium", "ESH.  Why didn\u2019t either of you spend any money on personal or marital counseling?  It sounds as if you don\u2019t even like each other. You\u2019re both acting not very nice to each other. You let her buy those animals. It sounds as if you guys don\u2019t communicate or set boundaries.  \nGet some help or get out of the marriage.  Actually, get help regardless.  You need to learn to communicate better and not foster resentment for any relationship to be healthy.", "ESH, though I'm sorry to say. I wish I could say N A H, but you have both been shitty to one another in one critical aspect: You've allowed the other to suppress their own needs and wants completely and wants to \"go along\" with what you wanted/needed at the time. \n\nYour wife unilaterally brought dogs into your life under the false pretense of rehoming them. Then she wore you down, and had you live a life you would've never chosen, just to make her happy. I won't shit on SAHMs, but agreements where one spouse earns the income and the other looks after the children and the home must be based on mutual happiness, and you should support each other to make sure you both are happy. That didn't happen. She lived her best life, did \"her part,\" and didn't give much of a crap how you felt. Hard times came and she still didn't step up to the partner plate. The fact it took for you to have a mental breakdown before she realized how miserable you were speaks volumes. So she's an AH for that. \n\nThe thing is, now you're doing the same to her. I'm not sure if you guys are really this incompatible or why it is that you both seem to think that the only way to make the other happy is to sacrifice your own happiness. I know this might sound like a grand gesture of love, but it isn't. Yes, she's trying to prioritize you by giving up the farm and the horses and whatnot. But she's now miserable. You are not an AH for taking some much-needed support from your partner, but you are an AH for willingly entering a role reversal where \"I was miserable for years for you, so now it's your turn to be miserable for me\"... while you still can't forgive her for letting you bear the weight of unhappiness for so long.\n\nYou guys are not partners, you're not a team. You're taking turns to be either gardener or flower, and you both hate when it's your turn to be a gardener. \n\nIf you still haven't sought it, please seek therapy. Each of you individually and as a couple if possible. \n\nYou need to figure out how to build a partnership and a family life you both truly enjoy together.", "I'm so sorry for your recent challenges. I know the pandemic upended so many lives.\n\nIt's interesting that you called her life perfect. It's also interesting that you feel responsible for it.\n\nNeither are true.\n\nYou have expressed that you have a relationship worth fighting for. Go fight for it. Love is an action, not a feeling.\n\nNTA.", "Like E S H and no one does. You guys failed to come together on the decisions that impact your lives the most. Financial and lifestyle.\n\nAre you an asshole for ruining your wife's perfect life? No. You both had a hand in that.\n\nSounds like when you finally raised the alarm she was willing to give up everything. Sounds like you also knew the ice was very thin long before it broke.\n\nAs a team you guys failed miserably.", "INFO: what exactly is the interpersonal conflict?", "NTA\n\nWhat your wife did earlier with the animals is clearly an asshole move. \n\nEverything else and the most recent problems sounds like ya'll just need some counseling to reconcile.", "ESH\n\n\"She wasn't working and days were spent riding horses, playing with dogs and looking after our two toddlers.\"\n\nI'm not a parent, but I always figured there was more to it than just casually being in the same property as the kids. In other words, I'm pretty sure it's actually work.", "ESH.  You two need to go to couples counseling and work on communication.  It sounds like part of it is you are resentful, but also gave in and agreed.  She wasn't understanding your workload.  You two need to be a team, not operating on expecting the other to know what you need.", "NAH - you need some couples counseling to sit down and work through all this together.
