Having her stay home and not contribute to chores and just have expensive animals all day is not fair to you. There can be a happy medium here. You live in town, and you have your one dog.

Then she wore you down, and had you live a life you would've never chosen, just to make her happy.

I'm not sure if you guys are really this incompatible or why it is that you both seem to think that the only way to make the other happy is to sacrifice your own happiness.

You are not an AH for taking some much-needed support from your partner, but you are an AH for willingly entering a role reversal where \"I was miserable for years for you, so now it's your turn to be miserable for me\"... while you still can't forgive her for letting you bear the weight of unhappiness for so long.\n\nYou guys are not partners, you're not a team. You're taking turns to be either gardener or flower, and you both hate when it's your turn to be a gardener. \n\nIf you still haven't sought it, please seek therapy.

So, wife definitely sucks here for steamrolling you.  You were an asshole mostly to yourself for not pulling the cord before you broke completely when open, honest communication might have fixed it.  You feel how you feel now and can't undo a lot, but once again, you need to have a discussion with your wife about why you're distant.

Forgive each other and start a new better life together- one that makes you both happier.", "And you were working a full time job to pay for everything, then working a full time job on the farm. \n\nThere is a reason farmers just farm. Cause it is full time work. She had the child rearing job, and that was it. you had the make money job and farm job. \n\nThere was still other stuff she could have done, or had you watch the kids while she did farm work.", "In my opinion, neither of you are really assholes, per se, but both of you could really benefit from counselling to kind of cool down from what sounds like a super hectic couple of years. You've had a lot of changes career-wise and personal wise, and it might be good to have a mediator to help both of you get out what needs to get out so that you can move forward from here. Not only that, but find a place where both of you can set, maintain, and hopefully respect those boundaries. please please please ignore the people who throw out divorce as the most immediate solution. This is absolutely fixable with both of you putting in the work to do so :)", "Most people I know who have horses board them with local stables. They either pay a fee, or work for free mucking out the stables or whatever it is horsey people do.", "One of the best pieces of advice I received years ago  regarding long term relationships is that \" there is  no place for  bean counting in marriage\".  Meaning the comparing of what one has done or not done against what the other has done or hasn't done.  You're a team.  Own the mistakes and choices the team has made whether they were great or not.  You both own all the beans.", "I wish you two the best.", "Thanks, this is probably my favourite answer. We both really want to make things work and both recognise that we love each other and have a good life together. I think, practically speaking, we are both working together to build a life for both of us now I.e we are both compromising. We just need to get over the trauma and mental hurdles. If I look at it pragmatically we have a very bright future ahead of us and a beautiful family that we can make work and prosper so long as we can deal with the past and put it behind us.", "Thanks, that is good advice.", "If you go outside and touch grass, people will say stuff like \"I support my SAHM partner.\" Or \"My SAHM partner doesn't work.\"\n\nThey don't mean that the SAHM is a lazy potato who is fully reliant on them.\n\nThey mean that the SAHM doesn't have formal employment and the family income is brought home by the working partner. They obviously know that the SAHM works at home doing housework and childcare. They obviously know that the SAHM allows for the working partner to go to work without having to hire help.\n\nStop purposely misinterpreting this shit as an excuse to shit on the man"]}
