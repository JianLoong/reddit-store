My ex is now engaged to someone the kids really like and she seems to be a really good influence on the household. I\u2019ve had little direct contact with her aside from insisting to meet with her when I learned indirectly that she was moving in with the kids/ex as I was told by my ex that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t ready for any relationship with me\u201d and he told mutual friends that she didn\u2019t think highly of me. When I met with her, she was kind and open. Through his discussions with mutual friends, I know that her last relationship ended due to infidelity and that she has trust issues. I\u2019ve also learned through mutual friends that my ex has not disclosed to her that our marriage ended due to him having an affair. He told her it was due to us \u201cgrowing apart\u201d, which I guess he could be used as a reason to justify the affair. I recently found out that they are now engaged, which makes me happy as my kids really like her and I trust their judgement (they\u2019re really great) and I\u2019m beyond happy that they like/love their future stepmom. My concern is that they become close to her and then she finds out about the affair and it\u2019s a deal breaker because she was mislead. I also feel like I\u2019ve been made to feel that I can\u2019t talk with her because she may find out the real reason behind why me and my ex split. I want her to stay, but I *don\u2019t* want my kids  to become attached to her only for something to go sideways when the truth eventually comes out.

Your intentions sound sincere but you need to stay out of it. Obviously if she were to ask you directly that's a different story.\n\nThe best you could do would be to implore your ex to be honest for the reasons provided. \n\nPeople love to justify their infidelity by saying that they'd grown apart or fallen out of love prior to the cheating, as if that magically means it doesn't count lol.", "Gentle YTA. I understand why you are concerned but it's really none of your business. Also, keep in mind that you're receiving a lot of this intel 3rd hand. You really don't know what kind of conversations they've had behind the scenes.\n\nIf she approaches you directly then be honest but until that day happens it's best to stay out of it.", "Your ex is deliberately lying to their new partner, to make themselves look good and blameless, and the partner deserves to know the truth about who they\u2019re really dating. I\u2019m not sure it should come from you, but someone needs to set the record straight. **NTA.**", "You WNBTA. Being cheated on can leave a person with trauma and general mistrust of people and relationships. No matter how hard we work to get over it, the scars still remain. In her shoes, I\u2019d want to know that I\u2019m not involved with a cheater (again). \n\nThat being said, your ex is behaving a bit shady by not letting you and his current partner get to know each other better. Since you have children involved, I\u2019d be wary of such behaviour from the ex.", "there\u2019s a shocking amount of ywbta in the replies. as someone with betrayal trauma, i would be over the moon if someone was kind enough to give me a warning before being stuck with a cheater for life. it may not be OP\u2019s business but it\u2019s glaringly obvious that her ex is lying to the new woman. if he\u2019s already lying about why his last relationship ended, what\u2019s stopping him from lying about literally anything else?", "I say NTA, from my perpspective your kids are your main priorty and saving them from heartbreak is part of keeping them safe. Like you said if she finds out down the line and splits the hurt your kids will feel is going to be worse than it would be now, you dont have to directly bring it up but you can slip in how its a little tough to see them getting married after what happened with you and just let it slip. But make sure mention that while its hard that you do genuinely like her and say that if it had to be anyone else your glad it her.", "Why do you have to save face for his infidelity. Why shouldn\u2019t she know that the man she\u2019s engaged to is divorced because of his infidelity? She\u2019s about to marry a man that cheated & she\u2019s divorced because her husband cheated. ESH", "I think YWBTA even though it's a crappy situation for you.\n\nBasically,  the relationship is their business . It's not your responsibility. It's also not your job to keep the secret. If it comes up or comes out from you, too bad. You're under no obligation to keep his cover. \n\nRe. Your kids, that ship has probably sailed. They already like her a lot. So all you'd be doing is creating the very situation you profess to fear.\n\nAlso, you can't protect them from everything I guess. This is all on your ex and how he decides to manage his relationships. I'd even say you might cop some blame from your kids if you say anything and the relationship breaks up, because they won't understand. \n\nAlso, men like your ex are why I don't trust vague answers...", "You have no cause to torpedo their relationship. What he did with you had no bearing on what he does with her. The old \u201conce a cheater always a cheater\u201d isn\u2019t true. They\u2019re grown adults, the kids like her, and she\u2019s a positive influence on them.", "YTA. Whilst you might be concerned about your children, you know that if you tell her there is a likelihood that she will leave him. This leads me to believe that this might not be the only reason you want to tell her. You want to tell her to set the record right about you and the obvious lies your ex has been feeding her about you. On some level, it's bothering you that he gets his happily ever after after cheating on you and probably only because he made you out to be a bad guy. \n\nLies always come to light. Live the best life you can. His lies will come out all on their own. You won't be the jealous ex, and he will have to answer to his own mess. Don't be the person he told her and the kids you are.", "YWBTA It's really nice of your business.  If you were really concerned about it you'd talk to your ex and push them to be honest about it.\n\notherwise it is not your job/duty/place to mess with their relationship.\n\nFurther, you do NOT know what he has or has but told her. You only know what the gossip mill says.\n\nYou broke up. Let them find their new happiness. Your job is to protect your kids as much as you can.", "YWBTA I feel bad that your kids might have to see a second marriage break up because your ex husband cheated on you, but that said its his problem. If you tell her, then you will be labeled the bad guy. It doesn\u2019t matter if they do or do not break up. On some level people will wonder if your intentions weren\u2019t motivated by revenge. And if they stay together then you\u2019re really in trouble because they\u2019ll resent you, which won\u2019t be easier for your kids. \n\nI think you should talk to your ex husband about it. And tell him your concerns. He absolutely lied to this woman and should have disclosed this info far before it got to the point of engagement. \n\nYour kids will manage if the worst does happen. If your Husband is going to keep doing things like this it will probably not be the last time he betrays someone\u2019s trust. They\u2019re probably going to have to deal with it for the rest of their lives to some degree since he\u2019s their father.", "Ywbta\n\nYou don't have to lie, your kids don't have to lie but do not go and tell her for no reason.\n\nRegardless of your reasoning this will make you look jealous and bitter. It will also cause massive problems with the person you coparent with. I just see no way this ends in a good way for anyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If so, they should perhaps be the ones to fall on that sword.", "Good men don't have affairs..", "Honestly, if it were anyone else I'd probably suggest they tell her but you're the ex. There really isn't a version of this where you emerge unscathed. \n\nShe stays and things are now really frosty with the ex or she leaves and things are now really frosty with your ex. This could have huge implications for your co-parenting relationship which I'd argue would have a bigger impact on your kids than a potential Step Mum leaving. \n\nI get what your friends are saying. I'd want to know too. But if it came from his ex I'd seriously question the motivation behind it. Frankly, if these friends care so much why can't they tell her?", "Those others who have first hand knowledge of the relationship, why don\u2019t they tell her?", "No worries! :)"]}
