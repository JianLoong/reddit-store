My ex is now engaged to someone the kids really like and she seems to be a really good influence on the household. I\u2019ve had little direct contact with her aside from insisting to meet with her when I learned indirectly that she was moving in with the kids/ex as I was told by my ex that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t ready for any relationship with me\u201d and he told mutual friends that she didn\u2019t think highly of me. When I met with her, she was kind and open. Through his discussions with mutual friends, I know that her last relationship ended due to infidelity and that she has trust issues. I\u2019ve also learned through mutual friends that my ex has not disclosed to her that our marriage ended due to him having an affair. He told her it was due to us \u201cgrowing apart\u201d, which I guess he could be used as a reason to justify the affair. I recently found out that they are now engaged, which makes me happy as my kids really like her and I trust their judgement (they\u2019re really great) and I\u2019m beyond happy that they like/love their future stepmom. My concern is that they become close to her and then she finds out about the affair and it\u2019s a deal breaker because she was mislead. I also feel like I\u2019ve been made to feel that I can\u2019t talk with her because she may find out the real reason behind why me and my ex split. I want her to stay, but I *don\u2019t* want my kids  to become attached to her only for something to go sideways when the truth eventually comes out. WIBTHA for letting her know now, or should I just keep my mouth shut?\n\nEDIT: have read all the comments and am grateful for all of the feedback, thank you! I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m just going to let it go and continue making sure the kids are good, regardless of what life throws our way. I\u2019ll continue to be kind and supportive of ex & fianc\u00e9 and if/when she finds out, it\u2019s not really any of my business how they deal with it. Aside from sharing a couple of really rad kids, his life is his to live and mine is mine and we\u2019ll each reap the consequences of our own choices. \n\nFor those suggesting friends mention it to her, they\u2019ve (one couple) never met her nor spoken with her in person. They\u2019ve only talked with ex and have encouraged him to share with her when he disclosed to them that he hadn\u2019t. If they went directly to her, it would be glaringly obvious it was because of me as he\u2019s not told them about the engagement. They\u2019ve talked a couple of times since the engagement but he never mentioned it to them and they only were just surprise to find out when we were visiting and they asked after him. \n\nHis family knows, my family knows and both of our families are awesome. Eventually, I\u2019m sure something will come out but I\u2019m going to go with my gut and continue to focus on raising strong kids who feel loved by family no matter what and just be nice to the soon to be new member of the family.", "created_utc": 1680339274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128gbr8/wibtah_for_outing_my_ex/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand why you are concerned but it's really none of your business. Also, keep in mind that you're receiving a lot of this intel 3rd hand.

Since you have children involved, I\u2019d be wary of such behaviour from the ex.", "there\u2019s a shocking amount of ywbta in the replies. as someone with betrayal trauma, i would be over the moon if someone was kind enough to give me a warning before being stuck with a cheater for life. it may not be OP\u2019s business but it\u2019s glaringly obvious that her ex is lying to the new woman. if he\u2019s already lying about why his last relationship ended, what\u2019s stopping him from lying about literally anything else?", "I say NTA, from my perpspective your kids are your main priorty and saving them from heartbreak is part of keeping them safe. Like you said if she finds out down the line and splits the hurt your kids will feel is going to be worse than it would be now, you dont have to directly bring it up but you can slip in how its a little tough to see them getting married after what happened with you and just let it slip.

If it comes up or comes out from you, too bad. You're under no obligation to keep his cover. \n\nRe. Your kids, that ship has probably sailed. They already like her a lot. So all you'd be doing is creating the very situation you profess to fear.\n\nAlso, you can't protect them from everything I guess. This is all on your ex and how he decides to manage his relationships. I'd even say you might cop some blame from your kids if you say anything and the relationship breaks up, because they won't understand. \n\nAlso, men like your ex are why I don't trust vague answers...", "You have no cause to torpedo their relationship.

Whilst you might be concerned about your children, you know that if you tell her there is a likelihood that she will leave him. This leads me to believe that this might not be the only reason you want to tell her. You want to tell her to set the record right about you and the obvious lies your ex has been feeding her about you. On some level, it's bothering you that he gets his happily ever after after cheating on you and probably only because he made you out to be a bad guy. \n\nLies always come to light. Live the best life you can. His lies will come out all on their own. You won't be the jealous ex, and he will have to answer to his own mess. Don't be the person he told her and the kids you are.", "YWBTA It's really nice of your business.  If you were really concerned about it you'd talk to your ex and push them to be honest about it.\n\notherwise it is not your job/duty/place to mess with their relationship.\n\nFurther, you do NOT know what he has or has but told her. You only know what the gossip mill says.\n\nYou broke up. Let them find their new happiness. Your job is to protect your kids as much as you can.", "YWBTA I feel bad that your kids might have to see a second marriage break up because your ex husband cheated on you, but that said its his problem. If you tell her, then you will be labeled the bad guy. It doesn\u2019t matter if they do or do not break up. On some level people will wonder if your intentions weren\u2019t motivated by revenge. And if they stay together then you\u2019re really in trouble because they\u2019ll resent you, which won\u2019t be easier for your kids. \n\nI think you should talk to your ex husband about it. And tell him your concerns. He absolutely lied to this woman and should have disclosed this info far before it got to the point of engagement. \n\nYour kids will manage if the worst does happen. If your Husband is going to keep doing things like this it will probably not be the last time he betrays someone\u2019s trust.

Then tell her only if she asks you?", "YWBTA. I get where you\u2019re coming from but it isn\u2019t your business.

This could also damage your kid\u2019s relationships to her and you.\n\nAs for the cheating they say once a cheater always a cheater but I have known instances where this is not true so because he cheated on you it\u2019s not a certainty he will cheat on her.

Not your place.", "I think everybody agrees that the truth should come out (and it will eventually, it always does), but I think the point of the YWBTA comments is that it should come from the ex. If he's honest with the fiancee, they can have a discussion about it and decide how it affects the relationship. It very well may end with the engagement being called off, especially because as you say he's been lying about it up to this point, but he should be involved with the telling. Worst case scenario he can see what affect his initial dishonestly had and try to get better, best case they have an open and honest conversation about things and find a way to move forward. If the ex was a raging asshole I don't think people would care so much but if he and OP are still on good terms, I would assume she would rather him learn from his mistakes and fix them himself, growing as a person in the process. He's already sabotaged his own relationship with his dishonesty, don't give him the ammunition to blame OP if things go south.\n\nNot to mention the chance, especially with the fiancee being so hesitant to meet OP in the first place, that if OP is the one to tell her she may assume OP is just trying to bust up her ex's new relationship out of jealousy - if she doesn't know the full context of why they split in the first place, then she has no accurate framing as to what OP's motives would be. Love can make you side with a partner even when any objective observer would tell you they're on the wrong side of an issue,", "I feel like it could definitely backfire coming from you but she 100% deserves to know.

He says he didnt. She def did. (She married the other guy). The thing is...I think he probably did. But in 25 yrs together he has never given me a sign he is anything except devoted to me. I questioned him about it when she initially started telling me. And then I decided it had nothing to do with me. It sounded like it was a case of being married young, kids came young, plus military life and they both made bad decisions for their marriage. Did I file it away as something to be aware of? Yes. But its not been an issue. He is an amazing father and husband. I would discuss it with him since your worries avout how it could affect your kids is valid.

Once my kids were adults, one of my boys was arguing with his Dad and brought up Dad\u2019s lies. Said he\u2019s overheard our arguments before we split, and knew his dad was lying.

Why did he say that his gf did not like or trust you, yet she is kind and gracious and caring to you? You find her lovely.  This is not the attitude of someone who does not trust or like you.  It is my belief he lied to you to keep you apart, in order to mitigate the possibility of you telling her. If he is lying so much to everyone involved, it means, to me, that he did not learn from his \"mistakes,\" is still duplicitous, and is more likely to commit the same transgressions. \n\nYWNBTAH, but, as others pointed out, the fall-out would be immense; it would impact your coparenting, having a much worse effect on your children in the long run.  Perhaps you can approach it sideways by hinting at his lying? For example, while conversing, tell her how much you appreciate her, and her relationship with your children. Tell her that you like her, and are glad that the two of you get along so well, especially since she didn't like you, nor trust you, at the start of the relationship. See what her reaction is. If she denies this, and asks you why you think this, tell her what your ex said about it. It might cause her to dig more deeply, or to start questioning. Of course, he will most likely lie some more to cover it up...", "Info: why did you say you amicably separated, but then revealed an affair?", "YTA. None of those is your business.", "YWBTA \n\nTalking to her will probably end in one of two scenarios: \n\n1) they break up, your ex would be furious and your kids would be thrown into a very emotional situation (dad's girlfriend is gone, dad is sad and angry because of mom)\n\n2) she already knew or she won't believe you. Either way they continue their relationship but you would be the \"ex that tried to sabotage the relationship\" \n\n\nIt's not your place. Your kids seem to like her so it doesn't matter if they breakup now or later: it will hurt your kids. \nAlso you don't know if they haven't talked about it.

It sucks that you feel like you can't talk to her because you have to \"keep a secret\". But the thing is that in this situation it doesn't seem as if you have to interact with her often. And on top of that, if she asks you directly you shouldn't lie...but i guess that question won't come up in regular conversations between you two. \n\nI understand it's not an easy situation but i think it would be best if you just focus on yourself and your kids and don't really think about what's going on between your ex and his girlfriend.", "You have betrayal trauma, and so you would believe if your spouse\u2019s ex told you about a previous betrayal.

In your place, I might not be able to not let another woman know she is being lied to", "I believe NTA. I think cheaters should be exposed, though.", "Neither do good women", "Well yeah, but there are things that aren't \"gray,\" and cheating is one of them. It takes a fundamentally cruel person to think something like that is justifiable in any case \n\nIt's like how stealing can be justified in certain situations, but extortion can't, even though they're similar crimes. The intent behind cheating is too selfish for it not to be a negative character indicator", "Outside of extreme mental illness or something, not-betraying a spouse is ridiculously easy. It's the default state.", "NTA -- but approach VERY carefully. Any good parent would know you are trying to protect your kids from another relationship-based trauma. But it's very easy for the ignorant or uninformed to say you're doing it out of jealousy. I would tell my ex-husband in no uncertain terms that I was trying to protect our kids, his hiding this shows a lack of integrity and the truth WILL come out eventually, he's foolish to think otherwise. And that you will find someone rational to tell his fiance\u00e9 the truth by X date if he chooses not to. What does he think will happen when your kids get old enough to ask more detailed questions? Are you supposed to lie to cover for him then? \n\nYou can and should force his hand to protect your kids; though with as much face-saving and diplomacy as possible. His last lapse in integrity literally cost your kids their parents marriage and he obviously cannot be trusted to do the right thing without coersion.\n\nThis does not mean it will turn out well-- the fiancee and others may not believe you, may hate you, may smear you to your kids. If you're petty and your motives are not pure, I believe you're still within your rights to inform a fellow woman of a potential snake. However, take as high a road as you can to maintain a stable co-parenting relationship if possible.", "NTA. she deserves to know. Everyone is saying \"oh but it should come from him,\" okay, sure, but it won't.", "I'm conflicted. My ex told his most recent girlfriend that we split up because I cheated on him (when it was the other way around) and even though he fully admitted to hitting me, walked that back and said it was a lie. She hates me and is terrible to my children. I wish I had set the record straight in the beginning, but I realize it would have gone much the same. If you tell her, you would be meddling, and she's likely not going to believe you, unfortunately. You're just going to have to let their drama play out. She probably knows on some level.", "Yup my friends ex did the same thing. She did find out from my friend before they got married, and chose to marry him anyway. A decade later, tensions in the house have been very high because surprise! He cheated on his new wife. The kids don\u2019t even want to go over there because it\u2019s a den of passive aggressive tension.", "Thank you for this. I\u2019ve always been honest with my kids (sometimes to a fault) and it\u2019s resulted in them really talking with me about anything. Even hard stuff as they know I won\u2019t judge and they can trust what I say. They did ask why we split up and I told them the truth while at the same time taking care not to speak I\u2019ll of their dad. As I said, he\u2019s a good father and he too has a good relationship with them. It\u2019s different than mine, to be sure, but it\u2019s good. I asked them how they were feeling after we talked about it and they said they were actually relieved to know because they were confused as to why we split when we never fought and there didn\u2019t seem to be any trouble. (We took care not to let any of our drama fall on them) It\u2019s because they trust me so much that I get protective and worry about all the things in this world that could hurt them. I just need to remember that in life, they\u2019ll need to deal with hurt and if we can raise them loved and strong, we can equip them to be able to weather the storms, but I can\u2019t stop every storm. \nI\u2019ll leave ex & fianc\u00e9 to their journey and take my own.", "Then THOSE friends should take her aside and say something. Also, those people are not your friends and they are not his. Trust that your business is being shares with him as well.", "TY. Cheating is pretty massive and a predictor of future behavior. But sometimes it isnt. I am sorry you went thru that, and happy that you guys have found a way to keep your children feeling safe, happt, and loved.", "\"Martin Luther King Jr was shit\"\n\n-You\n\nLife is far more complex than that. Cheating on someone is a shitty thing to do and I don't suggest ever forgiving a cheater under any circumstances but to say someone cannot be a good person due to one flaw that literally only affects one person is ridiculous.", "In this case there are people who are mutual friends. They brought up the concern. They have equal power to tell the new fianc\u00e9e the story. Their choice to tell the fianc\u00e9e doesn't create as great a risk of potentially taking a functioning divorce and turning it into a dysfunctional divorce.\n\nAs the adult child of deeply dysfunctionally divorced parents, I can assure you that this is a horrible position to put your kids in. Every life event - graduations, weddings, etc - is made stressful and political.\n\nSo, OP's job is to explain to those friends that she understands their concern but wants to stay totally out of it and that if they tell the fianc\u00e9e, they need to make absolutely sure that anyone who thinks to ask is told that OP wanted nothing to do with the situation and was determined to stay out of it and prioritized her relationship with her ex over any need to out him.\n\nYes, this sucks. But there is a clear path to getting the fianc\u00e9e the info without involving OP.", "The fiancee deserves to know. According to some, you'd be \"staying out of it\" to do right in one area, and it would potentially DIRECTLY hurt someone else.", "It's not, but being a bad part er doesn't automatically make you a bad dad or the kind of person who goes out of their way to kick dogs. \n\nI assume, but could be mistaken, that that's what she means when she says he's a good man. He wasn't good to her, but he didn't become a batman villain.", "MLK was a complicated guy but yes, he was a fucking asshole for all the cheating he got up to.", "He was a shit husband, how is that even up for discussion in your mind? Plenty of great philosophers were terrible people.", "why is this even relevant lol no one said they do anywhere", "Yes? How does that relate to this?", "You can't not do the right thing just to avoid making someone mad. OP can't let the ex get away with deceiving or hurting others just to keep a selfish, lying ex happy. If the ex responds to not being allowed to deceive or hurt others by being mean to his kids' mother, that's on him. Blaming OP for upsetting the ex is a double-standard - the ex would deserve the blame for not keeping the peace; deceiving someone is not a protected right that he's entitled to lash out over losing.", "And the people who cheat aren't necessarily 100% bad, but they're not good either. It's incredibly easy not to cheat on your spouse.", "I mean if you can't admit MLK was a good person despite being a bad husband I couldn't care less about your opinions or morality. They are juvenile and unrealistic if I'm being kind.", "I didn't say he wasn't a shit husband. But that person implied you can't be unfaithful and generally good. That is astoundingly stupid.", "You are giving a free pass to the folks who know about the situation, are better acquainted with the fianc\u00e9e and are choosing to try to get OP involved rather than acting on their own ethical principles.\n\nIn my view, my approach isn't blaming OP, making her responsible for her ex's feelings or letting the ex get away with something. There are multiple people who are capable of informing the fianc\u00e9e. The most important ethical consideration here is to protect the kids from the adult problems.\n\nIf anything, the other friends are being unreasonable by laying it at the feet of OP to act. They are unwilling to be the bearer of bad news. Why? Because they know it could cause them blowback. They, naturally, want to avoid the blowback and are telling themselves it's not their place. They seem to think it's OPs information to share as the victim of the infidelity. That's understandable at a surface level, but OP should tell them why she can't be involved and can't weigh in on their decision of what to do with the information they have. Once they see that, they can choose the ethical path.\n\nETA: as someone who has parents who have a deeply dysfunctional divorce, I would add that 'who is to blame' is not very useful information for navigating the gauntlet of problems that inevitably spiral from parents who are bad at being divorced.", "[removed]", "Yeah, others could do the right thing, but they're not, and OP doesn't have the power to force them.", "Agreed. If they didn't want people to know they cheat, they shouldn't cheat. If they think it's okay to do, they should also be honest about that with everybody in their lives", "You seem to be blaming her for prioritizing her kids.", "Someone should tell her. Not you though.", "YTA. Stay out of it. She's marrying someone she doesn't truly know, who is not trustworthy. It's her mistake to make, unfortunately.", "Because you are the ex, I would only tell her if she asks you.", "You would come across as the bad ex that can\u2019t get over it, so ywbta.", "Nobody would blame his EX for not telling her.", "It's wrong to let someone be deceived and betrayed just to keep someone happy to make life falsely look happier for your kids. You can't sacrifice one person's well being or autonomy because keeping the wrongdoer happy makes life easier for others.", "Like I said, the friends have a responsibility here to relieve OP of the dilemma. You are welcome to believe that she's immoral for wanting to shield her kids. I prefer not to lay that guilt trip or condemn her kids to the task of managing the fallout of the decision. But you are welcome to your views and to keep down voting mine :)\n\nTake care.", "YWBTA", "NTA since you didn't say anything. It's not your relationship, it's not your secrete to tell, it's none of your business. Just stay out of it. The last thing you need is WW3 with your ex and the person you're coparenting with. Let him deal with his house of cards."]}
