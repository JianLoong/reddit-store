My ex is now engaged to someone the kids really like and she seems to be a really good influence on the household. I\u2019ve had little direct contact with her aside from insisting to meet with her when I learned indirectly that she was moving in with the kids/ex as I was told by my ex that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t ready for any relationship with me\u201d and he told mutual friends that she didn\u2019t think highly of me. When I met with her, she was kind and open. Through his discussions with mutual friends, I know that her last relationship ended due to infidelity and that she has trust issues. I\u2019ve also learned through mutual friends that my ex has not disclosed to her that our marriage ended due to him having an affair. He told her it was due to us \u201cgrowing apart\u201d, which I guess he could be used as a reason to justify the affair. I recently found out that they are now engaged, which makes me happy as my kids really like her and I trust their judgement (they\u2019re really great) and I\u2019m beyond happy that they like/love their future stepmom. My concern is that they become close to her and then she finds out about the affair and it\u2019s a deal breaker because she was mislead. I also feel like I\u2019ve been made to feel that I can\u2019t talk with her because she may find out the real reason behind why me and my ex split. I want her to stay, but I *don\u2019t* want my kids  to become attached to her only for something to go sideways when the truth eventually comes out.

Your intentions sound sincere but you need to stay out of it. Obviously if she were to ask you directly that's a different story.\n\nThe best you could do would be to implore your ex to be honest for the reasons provided. \n\nPeople love to justify their infidelity by saying that they'd grown apart or fallen out of love prior to the cheating, as if that magically means it doesn't count lol.", "Gentle YTA. I understand why you are concerned but it's really none of your business. Also, keep in mind that you're receiving a lot of this intel 3rd hand. You really don't know what kind of conversations they've had behind the scenes.\n\nIf she approaches you directly then be honest but until that day happens it's best to stay out of it.", "Your ex is deliberately lying to their new partner, to make themselves look good and blameless, and the partner deserves to know the truth about who they\u2019re really dating. I\u2019m not sure it should come from you, but someone needs to set the record straight. **NTA.**", "You WNBTA. Being cheated on can leave a person with trauma and general mistrust of people and relationships. No matter how hard we work to get over it, the scars still remain. In her shoes, I\u2019d want to know that I\u2019m not involved with a cheater (again). \n\nThat being said, your ex is behaving a bit shady by not letting you and his current partner get to know each other better. Since you have children involved, I\u2019d be wary of such behaviour from the ex.", "there\u2019s a shocking amount of ywbta in the replies. as someone with betrayal trauma, i would be over the moon if someone was kind enough to give me a warning before being stuck with a cheater for life. it may not be OP\u2019s business but it\u2019s glaringly obvious that her ex is lying to the new woman. if he\u2019s already lying about why his last relationship ended, what\u2019s stopping him from lying about literally anything else?", "I say NTA, from my perpspective your kids are your main priorty and saving them from heartbreak is part of keeping them safe. Like you said if she finds out down the line and splits the hurt your kids will feel is going to be worse than it would be now, you dont have to directly bring it up but you can slip in how its a little tough to see them getting married after what happened with you and just let it slip. But make sure mention that while its hard that you do genuinely like her and say that if it had to be anyone else your glad it her.", "Why do you have to save face for his infidelity. Why shouldn\u2019t she know that the man she\u2019s engaged to is divorced because of his infidelity? She\u2019s about to marry a man that cheated & she\u2019s divorced because her husband cheated. ESH", "I think YWBTA even though it's a crappy situation for you.\n\nBasically,  the relationship is their business . It's not your responsibility. It's also not your job to keep the secret. If it comes up or comes out from you, too bad. You're under no obligation to keep his cover. \n\nRe. Your kids, that ship has probably sailed. They already like her a lot. So all you'd be doing is creating the very situation you profess to fear.\n\nAlso, you can't protect them from everything I guess. This is all on your ex and how he decides to manage his relationships. I'd even say you might cop some blame from your kids if you say anything and the relationship breaks up, because they won't understand. \n\nAlso, men like your ex are why I don't trust vague answers...", "You have no cause to torpedo their relationship. What he did with you had no bearing on what he does with her. The old \u201conce a cheater always a cheater\u201d isn\u2019t true. They\u2019re grown adults, the kids like her, and she\u2019s a positive influence on them.", "YTA. Whilst you might be concerned about your children, you know that if you tell her there is a likelihood that she will leave him. This leads me to believe that this might not be the only reason you want to tell her. You want to tell her to set the record right about you and the obvious lies your ex has been feeding her about you. On some level, it's bothering you that he gets his happily ever after after cheating on you and probably only because he made you out to be a bad guy. \n\nLies always come to light. Live the best life you can. His lies will come out all on their own. You won't be the jealous ex, and he will have to answer to his own mess. Don't be the person he told her and the kids you are.", "YWBTA It's really nice of your business.  If you were really concerned about it you'd talk to your ex and push them to be honest about it.\n\notherwise it is not your job/duty/place to mess with their relationship.\n\nFurther, you do NOT know what he has or has but told her. You only know what the gossip mill says.\n\nYou broke up. Let them find their new happiness. Your job is to protect your kids as much as you can.", "YWBTA I feel bad that your kids might have to see a second marriage break up because your ex husband cheated on you, but that said its his problem. If you tell her, then you will be labeled the bad guy. It doesn\u2019t matter if they do or do not break up. On some level people will wonder if your intentions weren\u2019t motivated by revenge. And if they stay together then you\u2019re really in trouble because they\u2019ll resent you, which won\u2019t be easier for your kids. \n\nI think you should talk to your ex husband about it. And tell him your concerns. He absolutely lied to this woman and should have disclosed this info far before it got to the point of engagement. \n\nYour kids will manage if the worst does happen. If your Husband is going to keep doing things like this it will probably not be the last time he betrays someone\u2019s trust. They\u2019re probably going to have to deal with it for the rest of their lives to some degree since he\u2019s their father.", "Ywbta\n\nYou don't have to lie, your kids don't have to lie but do not go and tell her for no reason.\n\nRegardless of your reasoning this will make you look jealous and bitter. It will also cause massive problems with the person you coparent with. I just see no way this ends in a good way for anyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There really isn't a version of this where you emerge unscathed. \n\nShe stays and things are now really frosty with the ex or she leaves and things are now really frosty with your ex. This could have huge implications for your co-parenting relationship which I'd argue would have a bigger impact on your kids than a potential Step Mum leaving. \n\nI get what your friends are saying. I'd want to know too. But if it came from his ex I'd seriously question the motivation behind it. Frankly, if these friends care so much why can't they tell her?", "Those others who have first hand knowledge of the relationship, why don\u2019t they tell her?", "No worries! :)", "Cheaters don't deserve to have their affairs kept hidden for them", "NTA I assumed you meant outing him as gay or bi. By all means, you're free to tell ANYONE your ex cheated on you! Tell her! She absolutely does deserve to know he lied to her!", "I don't know but it's a major red flag that he's hiding it from her. It means he doesn't want her to be fully informed in their relationship. It's manipulative on his part.\n\nMaybe don't tell her outright, but make it known that you're available to talk if she wants?", "YWBTA. I get where you\u2019re coming from but it isn\u2019t your business. Also she likely will think you want the ex back or have some ulterior motive for telling her this. She is going to want to believe the fianc\u00e9 as that\u2019s normal human behavior to believe what we want to believe. You\u2019ll come off looking either petty or  a busybody. This could also damage your kid\u2019s relationships to her and you.\n\nAs for the cheating they say once a cheater always a cheater but I have known instances where this is not true so because he cheated on you it\u2019s not a certainty he will cheat on her. To make that claim is simply projection.", "YTA, as others have said.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s 100% valid that you insist that you meet and have contact information and at least passing familiarity with the person who will be living with your kids, and probably be their responsible-adult at times.\n\nI would make it clear to him: \u201cI will not inform her you cheated, nor try to sneak such information to her at any time. But secrets always come out, and you are going to break the kids if it comes out and they lose this wonderful person from their lives. Don\u2019t do that to them.\u201d", "NTA because honestly if I were her, I would 100% want to know that man\u2019s character before getting serious. She deserves to know the truth and make her own decision. Hiding the information from her is wrong.", "NTA. Yes it\u2019s their relationship and their issue to work out but this directly effects your children.  How you handle it can be dicey. Perhaps speak frankly with your ex and tell him he to open and honest with her. Tell him Lack of communication and dishonesty sank your marriage and it will sink his next marriage. Encourage them to do premarital counseling. Ultimately your children\u2019s well being and happiness is at stake, so you are definitely NTA", "NTA.", "YWBTA. Do not tell your ex\u2019s fianc\u00e9 about his infidelity. As much as she needs to know it is not your place or responsibility. Besides he has already lied to you about her not wanting to meet you so he will just lie to her saying that you are jealous or something else. Now, if she ever comes to you and asks you directly why you split up then I would tell her that truth but that is not the case here.\nI know you love your children but want to protect them from future pain. Unfortunately, you have to let this situation play out the way it is going to. Who knows, maybe your ex will make this relationship work although somehow I doubt it.", "Keep out of it, and if she asks you about your relationship with him just say that you'd rather not talk about it", "NTA but why are you depending on information from mutual friends?", "Stop kidding yourself OP. Yeah, it probably will come out and they'll have to work through that together but that's not your business. You want to tell her for your own validation.

Cheaters do not deserve to live happy lives.", "Honestly she\u2019ll either figure it out herself or he has actually changed and she\u2019s experiencing a different version of him.

This shit is living in your head rent free disengage my friend", "NTA\n\nI think anyone should know they\u2019re getting engaged to someone who cheated and broke up their last marriage. It doesn\u2019t speak much to his character that he hid it from her\n\nI think she\u2019d believe it more if it didn\u2019t come from you, though", "Leave it alone. Not your place.", "I think everybody agrees that the truth should come out (and it will eventually, it always does), but I think the point of the YWBTA comments is that it should come from the ex. If he's honest with the fiancee, they can have a discussion about it and decide how it affects the relationship. It very well may end with the engagement being called off, especially because as you say he's been lying about it up to this point, but he should be involved with the telling. Worst case scenario he can see what affect his initial dishonestly had and try to get better, best case they have an open and honest conversation about things and find a way to move forward. If the ex was a raging asshole I don't think people would care so much but if he and OP are still on good terms, I would assume she would rather him learn from his mistakes and fix them himself, growing as a person in the process. He's already sabotaged his own relationship with his dishonesty, don't give him the ammunition to blame OP if things go south.\n\nNot to mention the chance, especially with the fiancee being so hesitant to meet OP in the first place, that if OP is the one to tell her she may assume OP is just trying to bust up her ex's new relationship out of jealousy - if she doesn't know the full context of why they split in the first place, then she has no accurate framing as to what OP's motives would be. Love can make you side with a partner even when any objective observer would tell you they're on the wrong side of an issue,", "I feel like it could definitely backfire coming from you but she 100% deserves to know. I would be upset if everyone knew and no one told me.", "And then he cheats on her, and everyone blames OP for protecting him.\n\nNTA She's being deceived. Tell her what he's lying to her about.", "She absolutely should know. It will destroy her trust the further along things get and the sooner she's told the better. However a more neutral party should tell her. Maybe these \"others\" should speak up", "So you don't want to warn her because you want them to stay together? How would you feel if someone did that to you?", "Why is this so hard for so many people to understand?", "This is the question to ask, OP. You as the ex won\u2019t be believed (especially if your ex will continue to lie). You telling what happened will only sour the coparenting relationship. \n\nYou can\u2019t protect your kids from their father\u2019s relationship fumbles, no matter how much you want to.", "Because people aren't black and white, 2d characters."]}
