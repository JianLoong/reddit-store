She doesn't get to act that way towards you then expect to be included in your big day. Nope. Actions have consequences. This is hers. Do you really want her making comments like that at your wedding?", "NTA.\n\nYou will *never* EVER be the asshole for excluding a bigot from your life events. I\u2019d even ensure venue staff and/or security have a picture of her and know she isn\u2019t welcome in case your dad spills the beans.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding! I hope you and your partner have a beautiful day & a happy life!", "NTA. It\u2019s YOURS and your partners wedding day.

She\u2019ll spend the entire reception asking your friends about their genitals.", "NTA. After I came out, my entire family was bigoted. I'm still a ways away from being in a place to start planning my wedding, but those people aren't coming.\n\nThis is your wedding, you want people who support you to be there. If your aunt attends, she'll disrespect you towards everyone she can. Do you really want to have to remember dealing with that on what should be the happiest day of your life? It's just not worth it, I hope the rest of your family understands.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone's betrayed family I think it's your aunt and being from a different generation is no excuse.  \n\nSome people from her generation may not understand transitioning, but they definitely understand how to treat people with kindness and your aunt chose to be nasty on more than one occasion, so why should she be any different at your wedding?", "NTA\n\nYour wedding. Your day. Your way.\n\n\"Sorry parents. Aunts invitation is in the trash along with her attitude. It she can't be civil to me on a regular day I damn sure do NOT want her at my wedding where she will attempt to ruin MY WEDDING DAY.\n\nThis is a hard line I will NOT negotiate. Topic is closed and if you do NOT like it feel free to not attend we will miss you.\"", "Hard NTA. She's shown you how much respect she has for you. No generational difference justifies the complete disrespect she's displayed and you're not required to tolerate it. Especially on a day meant to celebrate you. \n\nIf she's unable to adjust, ask your dad how he plans to make sure she doesn't make bigoted comments at the wedding. They either acknowledge she can't be changed and would therefore ruin the day for you and your partner, or they acknowledge that she can and hasn't. If she has changed, you're owed a heck on an apology before you even consider inviting her. It's 100% on her that she's not invited and anyone pressuring you to allow her to come should face potentially having their invite revoked. \n\nYou either side with or against bigotry. Anyone pushing you to invite her is showing you they side with bigotry when it suits them.", "NTA. Both my mom (who's in her 70s) and I are cis straight women and tonight we watched two episodes of Queer Eye and the new RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars together, both of which are shows we love. Not to mention when one of my friends in college came out as a trans woman, my mom was very supportive and always enjoyed having her to our house. You can be a different generation all day long, but being an asshole knows no age. Shame on your aunt.", "NTA. She doesn't deserve an invite to your wedding, and don't take that she's from a different generation bullshit. It only enables her to continue to be a bigot.", ">My dad keeps asking where my aunts invitation is.\n\n\"It doesn't exist, it never will, now quit asking\"\n\nAnd when he does try to ask again, reply with \"that's already been asked and I've already answered it\"", "NTA.  This \u201cdifferent generation\u201d thing is such a poor excuse.  My mom is in her 80s.  She met my friends\u2019 trans son a few years ago.  She never got his pronouns wrong once the entire day.  Hell, she complimented them on raising such a polite, smart, funny son.  Older people can adapt & accommodate if they\u2019re not assholes.", "This. ^^^ All of this. \n\nNTA.", "I cannot believe OPs parents even think to ask! WtH?\n\nNTA", "Really?
