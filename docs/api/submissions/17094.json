I'm still a ways away from being in a place to start planning my wedding, but those people aren't coming.\n\nThis is your wedding, you want people who support you to be there.

They either acknowledge she can't be changed and would therefore ruin the day for you and your partner, or they acknowledge that she can and hasn't. If she has changed, you're owed a heck on an apology before you even consider inviting her. It's 100% on her that she's not invited and anyone pressuring you to allow her to come should face potentially having their invite revoked. \n\nYou either side with or against bigotry.

You can be a different generation all day long, but being an asshole knows no age. Shame on your aunt.", "NTA.

Keep yours instead.", "I'm in the same generation as your aunt, being older is not an excuse. Being older means she's had more time to learn to behave properly, she just chooses not to.

There are plenty of members of her generation who are affirming and kind, or at the very least can keep her tongue. She takes pleasure in disrespecting people who looks down on, and she's more than likely to cause drama at **your** wedding.\n\nTell your parents that you cannot in good conscience invite someone to **your wedding** who has demonstrated a complete lack of decency or civility towards you.
