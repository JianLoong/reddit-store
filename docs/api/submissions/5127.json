While you're at it, tell him if he doesn't like it then he can move out.", "NTA, from this he doesn't sound at all prepared for adult life. He should be able to go buy and prepare his own food. If you were all eating the same thing it would be one thing but he can't expect you to make a different meal every night (he should be embarrassed to ask)", "Definitely NTA. He\u2019s 28 and only works 20 hours a week. Start charging him \u201crent\u201d in the form of cooking meals for you and your daughter. It\u2019s a skill he\u2019ll thank you for later.", "NTA. Unless he legit has some disability that prevents him from cooking, he is being a spoiled brat. He is 28, not 8, he can perfectly cook for himself.", "NTA !!! he is a ADULT, i think he knows OP doesnt always have time to make 2 diff dishes\u2026 He is 28?? He should be greatfull that he has a FREE place to stayy! I think OP\u2019s son is a little spoiled.. if he criticises the food so much, why doesnt he make it himself?", "How about the lazy git cooks for himself, and maybe even for you and your daughter? Totally NTA of course, nurses work hard enough as it is.", "Dude, your son is 28 and and bitching that his mom, who he lives with and pays no bills, isn\u2019t cooking for him?! Do you feed that your enabling his crappy behavior? Is there a reason an almost 30 yr old is still living with mom and not on his own? Unless there is a legitimate reason for him only working just 20\u2019hours a week and living at home, YTA for enabling him to treat you the way he does and not making him more accountable as an adult. But NTA for not cooking for him. Need to cut the cord at some point.", "NTA stop cooking for both of them, your \u2018between jobs\u2019 daughter can get her butt in the kitchen and your son can equally demonstrate his vegan cooking skills as yours are so woeful (according to him). Not surprised you are exhausted, who does all the other household chores?", "NTA but I think you've likely contributed to him being overly entitled.  He should be contributing to the house as an adult working and living at home still.", "NTA.

Otherwise you\u2019re setting him up for failure and enabling his horrible attitude. I would have kicked him out the second time he back talked me for not cooking his precious vegan food good enough for him.", "NTA for not cooking, but you are one for putting up with a 28yo son who lives rent-free at home and is disrespectful.  Time for you to 'push him out of the nest', and your daughter too, as soon as she finds work.\n\nAt the very least start charging them rent. Then keep those funds separate and use the money to cover their deposit and first month's rent on THEIR OWN PLACE!", "NTA: veganism is a choice, and while it's one rooted in very good reasons and facts, it's still a *personal* choice.  You try your best to cook for him and he criticizes it (with his lighter workday, he should just be overjoyed you were willing to even try those times).  You've tried your damndest to find all the things you know you can pick up for him bc like hell apparently is he going shopping. (Edit: All while working a high stress, long hours job.)  In short, you've MORE than been respectful and done your best to help him have easy as possible access to food he wishes to eat.  He's being a massively ungrateful son, and he should really sit down and think about all this.  He COULD have ended up with the family that makes fun of his veganism and forces him to do ALL his shopping and cooking while trying their best to get him to just give it up.  He should be so, so happy for his supportive family.  Ask any given vegan how often a day they're the butt of constant jokes by their own closest loved ones.", "NTA \n\nHe can very easily cook his own food when he only works 20 hours a week.

Not only should he never argue that your very tired self won\u2019t make him special food and your own food, but he should take responsibility for his dietary preferences and realize they are not anyone else\u2019s burden.  What is the argument anyway?  You work hard and are tired.  He barely does and he\u2019s a grown A adult!  Tell him to sit down and shhhhh!  He needs to step up here.", "YTA for not telling him that you weren't a Burger King and he is not getting it his way. There is no reason that a 28 year old supposed man should not be working a full time job unless he's in college or something working on a degree. But even still, students who school full time and work full time still manage to buy groceries and cook for themselves. What is the reason your son can't? Stop enabling him. If wants to make dietary choices for himself, that's fine and good. He can buy his own groceries and cook for himself.And he's being disrespectful and ungrateful as well? Sweetie, cut the apron strings. Now. With a chainsaw.  \nEdit to add: you are NTA for not cooking for him. He needs to learn.", "NTA for not cooking for him.\n\nHowever, you are the asshole for enabling his BS. He is an adult who is almost 30, he NEEDS a FULL TIME job (40 hrs wk) and to move the F out. If he wants vegan food, he can buy it and cook it on his own. You and daughter are not vegan, so if you cook for yourself, it doesn't take much effort to cook for her too. If he wants you too cook for him, then he can eat what you cook.\n\nI have no sympathy for your son, who is acting like an entitled asshole.", "ESH except your daughter\n\nHe\u2019s an entitled AH who needs to cook his own damn food.\n\nYou\u2019re an AH for enabling and raising him to be like this.\n\nHe\u2019s 28, a fully grown adult capable of paying rent and fending for himself. Start treating him like this.", "NTA\n\n He needs to grow up and stop whining.", "NTA however you could suggest that if he gave you specific details on what he will eat without complaining then you might feel inclined to cook for him occasionally.  Free room at his age is a privilege, he should be more appreciative.", "My 26yr son went vegetarian 7 months ago.  I gave him 2 cookbooks.  Once in a while I'll cook a family meal he can eat with us.  Rarely I'll cook 2 separate meals.  Your son is an adult with a job.  He should be fending for himself but he just seems lazy.  NTA", "NTA... With 3 grownups under the same roof you should be taking turns cooking. Being vegan doesn matter. IF he does not like the food thats served then he's just being Rude. There's nothing wrong with eating non vegan food. Its much healthier and also better for the enviorment to atleast occasionslly eat meat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell no!  I\u2019m going to assume he also does very little in the way of household chores, right?  He\u2019s not a little kid!  You aren\u2019t his mommy anymore.

I was an adult living at home but it hardly meant I couldn\u2019t take care of myself.", "NYA, No offense but your son sounds like a deadbeat.   Cooking for him is enabling him to be a bigger one.  Surely you realize he should be working and living on his own by now.", "Cut that umbilical cord!", "Not sure why \"vegan ingredients\" are expensive when they are literally vegetables, beans, rice, and maybe some tofu.

He is absolutely grown enough to feed himself, and, this is maybe controversial, but he is also grown enough to pitch tf in and make a dinner for all y\u2019all. He doesn\u2019t like how you cook vegan food? Well, Chef Big Boy can put on a cooking demo, every day, by feeding himself.", "I've finally come across a post I can relate to (minus the vegan part). My adult son lives with me too.  We both work, him less than me and he does contribute money to the house.  We have a set amount ($1k per month) because he makes way less than me.  That covers rent, food and cell phone. When it comes to food, I go shopping every weekend and he can add items to my list.  There are time when I feel like cooking and times I don't. On the days I don't, he has choices because he selected what he wanted me to buy. If he has nothing then he orders himself takeout. He never complains I didn't cook because I made it clear we are roommates and I'm not his \"mommy\" any more.  He's expected to do his own laundry and get himself to work.  Me making him food that day is a bonus and not an expectation. Good luck making better boundaries for your children!! And give your daughter same rules.

It seems like your nearly 30 year old son thinks you aren't doing him a major favor, but that you're his parent and should still be looking after him.

I would tell both children that if they want to come shopping with you, you will buy the ingredients that they request. However if they don't want to, then they are fully responsible for purchasing anything that they want but you did not buy on your grocery trip. This also means that if they don't shop with you, then they do not have a say in the dinners that are cooked each night. Since you're not charging either of them rent, this should not be a problem. I would tell him if he isn't happy he can always live on his own!"]}
