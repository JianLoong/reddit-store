In short, you've MORE than been respectful and done your best to help him have easy as possible access to food he wishes to eat.  He's being a massively ungrateful son, and he should really sit down and think about all this.  He COULD have ended up with the family that makes fun of his veganism and forces him to do ALL his shopping and cooking while trying their best to get him to just give it up.

On the days I don't, he has choices because he selected what he wanted me to buy. If he has nothing then he orders himself takeout. He never complains I didn't cook because I made it clear we are roommates and I'm not his \"mommy\" any more.  He's expected to do his own laundry and get himself to work.
