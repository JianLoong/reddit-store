I have recently been working more odd hours, as opposed to my wife\u2019s normal 8-about 6 routine. As such, we have not really seen much of each other for about a week. \n\nWe\u2019re also just normally very lovey-dovey, cuddling, and all that stuff. We make sure not to do PDA, and keep it not sexual most of the time. \n\nAlso, her sister(F33) has recently divorced from her husband, for reasons that are irrelevant in my opinion. Just for context, her sister had an Indian style arranged marriage, and does not see the point of love marriages in general. She is taking this quite hard, as in India, where she got her previous marriage from, there is sadly a lot of stigma surrounding women who have divorced, which means if she doesn\u2019t find a love marriage, she will likely be all alone for the rest of her life, as very few people will want to arrange a marriage with her. I personally think the whole concept of arranged marriages is fine, but a lot of the standards and stigmas surrounding it are quite backwards. \n\nSo, my sister has been staying with me and my wife. We\u2019re ok with it and she's honestly a very nice roommate, always cleaning up after herself, super respectful of rules in the house. \n\nRecently, my wife and I got lucky, and I had my workday end at 5 on Friday, and she came home early. We were pretty excited and once we were both home we were together. \n\nWe decided to watch a movie together after a while, and we were lying on the couch cuddling, sweet talking to each other a little bit. Her sister came into the room, and sat down on the other couch and watched the movie. \n\nWe weren\u2019t really saying anything tbh, just stuff like how we missed each other, how it was so painful to be without each other, how we loved each other a lot, that sorta stuff. I was trying to be soft cus the sister looked like she was actually watching the film, but at one point I just held my wife\u2019s face and told her \u201cyou\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the world\u201d. I didn\u2019t notice it at the time but I believe that was when her sister left the room. \n\nLater on in the night, after my wife had gone off to prepare for bed, her sister came out and yelled at me. She basically accused me of cuddling with my wife specifically to mock the fact she doesn\u2019t have a husband anymore, and that I was saying that she wasn\u2019t beautiful when I told my wife she was the most beautiful. \n\nI tried to calm her down, but she got more riled up, fixating on comparisons between my wife and her, getting a bit too close to me for my liking, and asking me questions like \u201cwhat makes her hotter than me?\u201d. She then held out for a hug, crying a bit but I shook my head, because I was a bit concerned how she went from yelling at me, to wanting physical comfort. Eventually she  just backed off and said ok, tearfully and walked away. \n\nAITA for saying it? Should I have given her a hug?", "created_utc": 1676717560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115crx8/aita_for_calling_my_wife_the_most_beautiful_woman/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's trampling all over yours.\n\nHer misery is not your problem.  You guys have helped her out and being there for her.  \n\nNow she's becoming a problem... It needs nipped in the bud if you want to keep your home feeling like a homely place for you and the wife.  That's the priority here. \n\nAnd you SHOULD be prioritising your wife and your marriage over her sisters sadness.", "NTA \n\nShe lashed at you for (checks notes)\u2026 being affectionate with your wife.\n\nHer insecurities aren\u2019t your problem and I think you made the right call in not hugging her.", "NTA. Absolutely not. You need to tell your wife about this and make sure that you aren't in this situation again. This is dangerous behaviour.\n\nYou have a great relationship with your wife and you shouldn't have to behave differently for anyone else.", "NTA - that\u2019s some weird ass behaviour from the sister there. Almost as if she was trying to come in between you and your wife.\nWhose partners sister asks the spouse if they think she\u2019s beautiful or not. It\u2019s unnatural and well done for how you responded", "NTA. I have three sisters. I would be happy to hear their husband's telling them that any time they wanted. She's insecure, not your fault or problem.\n\n Please continue to tell your wife that. Everyday and in front of whoever.\n\nEdit to add: I just couldn't stop thinking about this and I want to make sure you understand two things:\n\n1. You are in no way responsible for this woman's mental health. \n2. She is crossing major boundaries with her sister by treating you like you should be caring for her feelings. It's honestly not okay at all.\n\nTalk to your wife. You do not need to communicate with her sister at all about her feelings. If she comes to you again you should tell her to direct that shit to your wife. It's WIERD that she went to you and not your wife in the first place.", "Nta\n\nIt's time for your SIL to go.

Wtf? And i don't normally use Wtf.\n\nI think SIL expects you to dump your wife and take her (because she's hotter?).\n\nYou did nothing wrong by showing your wife that you love her.\n\nSiL has no right to stay with you and since she showed no respect for you and your wife (her sister) she must go NOW.\n\nIt doesn't matter what made her act like this!\n\nShe's a huge A!\n\nEdit: For those who don't understand why i might seem too nuclear, here's the reason:\n\n\"and that I was saying that she wasn\u2019t beautiful when I told my wife she was the most beautiful.\n\nI tried to calm her down, but she got more riled up, fixating on comparisons between my wife and her, getting a bit too close to me for my liking, and asking me questions like \u201cwhat makes her hotter than me?\u201d. \"\n\nWho in their right minds dares to ask her brother in law why does he thinks her sister is \"hotter\" than she is?\n\nWho in their right mind makes comparison between sisters to her BIL?\n\nWhat was she expecting him to do?\n\nHug her and kiss her and tell her she's the most beautiful woman in the world and he will leave his wife for her?

I wouldn't take it personally, like you did anything wrong. But i also wouldn't apologize to her or anything. It's your house, your wife, and if you dont have the liberty to do this there, then where will it be? Either the sister can acknowledge her insecurity and work on it or live somewhere else.\n\nI also think you deserve an apology from her for her outburst.", "NTA.

I would consider it a strike against her - and you and your wife should have a serious conversation about what boundaries to set with sister - and what will happen if she crosses them \n\nGood luck to you - and your wife, the most beautiful woman in the world ;)", "CLEARLY NTA. \nIt is *your* wife after all\u2026 Her sister's behavior makes me think that she is one of those people who takes everything as a personal attack: if you cuddle your wife it is to make her sister feel that she has no husband, if you tell your wife that she is the most beautiful woman, it is to tell her sister that she is not\u2026\n\nI can understand that she may be oversensitive because of the delicate personal situation she is going through, but ffs, she is going to live with a young couple, what the hell did she expect? That all your behavior revolves around her?", "NTA. \n\nAs far as you saying it...when she moved in she knew she was moving in with a married couple and might witness personal moments between you. Beauty is subjective, and hey, maybe it is just me, but I think that, to you, the most beautiful person in your world should be your wife, after all beauty is not just skin deep, beauty can come from mind, heart and soul, and there is a reason you married her. \n\nAs for not giving your SIL a hug at that moment, it sounds like that would've been the wrong thing. It sounds as though she's skipped the feelings of loneliness, and jealously that her sister is in a happy loving marriage, and is jealous over her sister having you as a husband.", "NTA\n\nSister is clearly struggling with the divorce but you didn't do anything wrong. She knows that too.", "Nta she has no right to demand you don\u2019t *checks notes* act like a loving caring kind husband in your own home just because she got divorced", "NTA, I don\u2019t see anything inappropriate from what you described here. Its fine for the sister to be affected looking at other loving couples, I get it, really do, but she shouldn\u2019t take it out on you", "NTA\nThats your wife, it's expected? SIL needs to understand shenis not the main characternin her sister's life. You did good in not approaching her physically, in her unhinged and quite jealous state she could mess with your marriage", "NTA Your interaction with your wife is sweet as I'm sure she is.\n\nYour SIL doesn't see the point in love marriages because she makes herself pretty unloveable.\n\nComplaining that your natural affection is rubbing things in her face is horribly insecure.", "NTA. One of the privileges of any husband is to think his own wife is the most beautiful woman in the world. If her sister doesn't understand that, it's not your fault. You don't owe *her* a husband's duties, and that's pretty much what she's asking in requesting physical comfort after yelling at you for not thinking she was equally beautiful.", "NTA. Please talk to your wife about what happened. She needs to know about this incident. \n\nYeah, you definitely did nothing wrong, she's clearly extremely upset still over her situation, and obviously is overly-sensitive about seeing other couples be happy, much less when it's her own sister. In fact, it's more of a sting for her that her own younger sibling has a loving, happy relationship when she's all alone. I'm not saying what you did was wrong (far from it, I think it's really sweet that you both find ways to be loving towards one-another regularly) but maybe consider dialling it down in front of her, just till she works through some of her issues in a more constructive way. \n\nPS: I'm the same way you guys are in my relationships, and I think it's awesome!", "NTA. \n\nIf I read correctly, you guys were already sitting together and talking sweet nothings to each other BEFORE she even walked in the room. And you just continued. And you continued quietly, trying NOT to disturb your SIL, respectful of the fact it seemed like she was actually into the movie. It had nothing to do with her.\n\nIt's not your fault if she self-internalized that and got upset; that she might feel jealous or bitter in response. It's understandable, for sure. But it's not your fault. She should be happy her sister has someone who loves her so much, and is in a marriage that is good. Not mad at you for it. \n\nI wouldn't take it too personally. It sounds like she's just hurting and processing a lot right now.", "NTA it\u2019s your home and you are entitled to speak to your wife like this anytime you want. Sister sounds jealous and fair enough she\u2019s went through a divorce, but she shouldn\u2019t be putting her insecurities on to you and her sister. Maybe time for her to leave if she\u2019s so offended.", "NTA - it's the sister's own fault, and the comparison thing is weird. But I do understand that for her two people showing affection is one of the most painful reminders of her failed marriage. And it's confronting her with maybe never having that. She's not reasonable, but I can't blame her for feeling shit seeing/hearing to people being so lovely while she's just divorced (and I wonder what the reasons were, to me that seems relevant if it is somehow connected to why she reacted like that)", "NTA, your home, your marriage - ergo it is up to you how ur gonna show affection to your wife. While I can understand her sister to some degree when it comes to traumas of cultural rules, still she was way out of the line with that yelling and entitlement.", "NTA.    Tell the sister to you your wife is the most beautiful person as your soulmates.  She makes you happy!    Divorce is hard and sometimes spouses say things without thinking it through in heat of moment. Have you and your  wife talk to her together.", "NTA. You and your wife obviously love one another deeply. That\u2019s awesome! Her sister is a guest in your home and unless you\u2019re literally initiating sex in shared living spaces with her in the room, you\u2019re damn well allowed to snuggle and be sweet with one another! \n\nIf she has issues, it\u2019s time for her to get out of your home and get into therapy. She\u2019s going through a lot but it isn\u2019t blanket permission to take it out on others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cringe and just show the sil want to 'replace'", "He is in his house.", "So she now lives with them she accepts it or she doesnt live with them. They cant change their lives. Also his wife was raised the same as the sister exactly - so its the sisters issue.", "Nope. She was being unstable he was right to deny her.", "Not a chance should he have hugged her.\n\nShe went from asking why his wife was hotter than her and then wanted a hug -  that sounds like she was trying to make a pass.\n\nIf she wants a hug she can go ask her sister.", "OP, I really hope you told your wife what happened. Even if you aren't specifically hiding it from her, if the sister decides to spin this against you it will look so much worse if you haven't already told your wife about it in detail.\n\nThe first person to tell the story is usually the one that gets believed, so don't let the sister be the one your wife finds out from.", "Goodness, especially after asking OP what makes his wife, her sister, hotter than her\u2026 she was up to no good and thank goodness OP refused to give in to the drama she was stirring up.", "This! OP needs to tell his wife ASAP."]}
