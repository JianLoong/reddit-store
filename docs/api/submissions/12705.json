I assured her that it was fine and that we didn't had to worry about that for now, and that if we were to want kids there's different methods. \n\nAs time went though she confessed to me that the reason why she can't have babies is because she had an ED that messed up her reproductive system. I made sure that she knew how much I loved her because she was kinda ashamed of it, although it's not really her fault (she was in therapy for this). The doctors basically told her that it'll be imposible for her to get pregnant, we talked about our future and we decided to adopt kids when we were ready to be parents. \n\nWe now decided that we were ready for marriage and then we would start trying to adopt a kid. Also at some point in our relationship we decided to not use protection anymore and she wasn't in birth control obviously, we were confident that she couldn't get pregnant because that's what doctors have said. \n\nRecently she's been feeling sick, it's not unusual though as she has a celiac disease and sometimes food gets contaminated (we're very careful with it but sometimes it still happens). She was sick for a couple days until she decided to go to the hospital.

So a while before the sun sets we walk down to the beach. She had prepared some sandwiches that we ate, we also ate some fruit/ drink juice etc.\n\nAt some point she tells me that she has a surprise for me and to close my eyes. I do and she puts a piece of paper in my hand and tells me to open them again. It's an ultrasound, ngl my first thought was \"what is this\" then I figured out. She was expecting me to say something so I asked her who's baby is it. She told me it was ours. This is were I might be the asshole. I laughed and said \"no really who's baby is it\", she insisted it was ours, and I told her \"you stole this from Google didn't you?\" Because I thought she was trying to prank me. She then said this wasn't a prank but I had already messed up her good humor. \n\nShe got angry and started to walk back home, i followed her and asked if it was true. She said yes, I got very happy and hugged her which I think made her a bit less angry. We picked our stuff and got back home. She told me that the doctors can't explain her pregnancy either, she has to do some tests so we still haven't told anyone, but she wanted me to know.

Holy crap that's awesome!", "NAH - I think this is a reasonable response to being told you're going to be a father by someone that told you they were sterile. Being shocked and in disbelief is a thing.", "NAH I can understand why she was hurt at first, but I don\u2019t think your reaction was unreasonable. Seems like you\u2019re both proceeding well after the fact, so no one is to blame.", "NAH. I've known so many people that have been told they're \"infertile\". Every single one of them has had at least one child. I've been told im infertile too but tbh I don't believe it.", "NAH in my opinion. I get why she was sad initially, but you weren\u2019t trying to be hurtful. I can see why you thought it was a joke. The doctors can\u2019t even explain it. Congratulations by the way!", "NAH   \n\n\nYour choice of words was less than optimal, but understandable.  In your place I would offer an apology then move on to the happy planning.", "NAH. Honest \"mistake\" if you even want to call it that. You had a reasonable reaction to something you thought was an impossibility. You're both happy now and that's what matters. You'll laugh about this eventually. And congrats!", "NAH.\n\nYour reaction is understandable, and so is hers. You thought she was joking but were actually happy about the news itself. She was being serious and was upset that you couldn't tell. Maybe you could plan a nice surprise for her to celebrate your news.

I\u2019m sure her expectation was immediate delight. You had been told that it couldn\u2019t happen so I feel like your disbelief was an understandable reaction.

Its a bit shitty you insisted when she told you she wasn\u2019t joking but i can let it slide. And infertile does not mean 100% not able to get pregnant. It just means almost impossible.

As a heads-up, pregnant ladies can be a bit on the sensitive side due to hormones (I'm pregnant, last week I cried because I ran out of my fave sandwich filling...).

I was working on a fishing boat in Alaska at the time and was getting sea sick, which I never got. Well during a big storm I was hanging over the railing wishing I could die when my captain convinced me and my husband to get a pregnancy test in Dutch Harbor. I told them I most likely had a brain tumor. Well I got the very expensive test at Eagles grocery and took it. I was so far along it went instantly pregnant and did not take the recommended 3 minutes. My brain shut off and I set it down, grabbed the company truck keys and started climbing over the other ships to get to the dock. Husband was following me trying to get me to tell my where I was going and what was wrong and I finally snapped and said I wanted my fucking 3 minutes. I took 3 more tests and none of them gave me my 3 minutes before it sunk in I was pregnant. I was already in my second trimester \ud83d\ude02.

Hopefully this will be a funny story for you two to tell your kid when they're older.", "NTA. Hopefully in a few years you can laugh about it.", "NAH. \n\nI get your reaction, and I get her reaction to your reaction. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, but unfortunately this didn't go the way your fiancee hoped it would. That's okay!

That you didn't mean to ruin a very special moment for her - for both of you- and that you hope she knows that you love her. Give it a pause, and then say how excited you are for the baby, this is miracle, and all that fun stuff. \n\nSometimes, even when we do nothing wrong, we apologize because the bigger thing is making sure the person we hurt is okay and can move on, regardless of how this all happened.

So yeah, even if you're diagnosed with infertility it's still a good idea to use birth control if you don't want a surprise pregnancy.

We're so excited!", "I guess she misunderstood them completely? I highly doubt any educated doctor would\u2019ve ever told her this so I\u2019m not understanding how or where she got that from.

Doctors are probably rushed for time and tell patients they are infertile without properly explaining what that means and patients have not been taught to do research about their own health conditions so they can better understand.", "Thank you explaining it like, that made me understand it really well!", "Infertile just means a lesser chance of reproducing. It doesn\u2019t even have to be that low, just lower than normal. \n\nAnd there are a lot of female reproductive conditions that cause infertility. A lot of women say they have them and were told they can\u2019t get pregnant, but later did (even multiple times). For some reason doctors will either say can\u2019t instead of less likely, or they say infertile and their patients assume that means sterile."]}
