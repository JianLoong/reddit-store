I assured her that it was fine and that we didn't had to worry about that for now, and that if we were to want kids there's different methods. \n\nAs time went though she confessed to me that the reason why she can't have babies is because she had an ED that messed up her reproductive system. I made sure that she knew how much I loved her because she was kinda ashamed of it, although it's not really her fault (she was in therapy for this). The doctors basically told her that it'll be imposible for her to get pregnant, we talked about our future and we decided to adopt kids when we were ready to be parents. \n\nWe now decided that we were ready for marriage and then we would start trying to adopt a kid. Also at some point in our relationship we decided to not use protection anymore and she wasn't in birth control obviously, we were confident that she couldn't get pregnant because that's what doctors have said. \n\nRecently she's been feeling sick, it's not unusual though as she has a celiac disease and sometimes food gets contaminated (we're very careful with it but sometimes it still happens). She was sick for a couple days until she decided to go to the hospital.

She was expecting me to say something so I asked her who's baby is it. She told me it was ours. This is were I might be the asshole. I laughed and said \"no really who's baby is it\", she insisted it was ours, and I told her \"you stole this from Google didn't you?\" Because I thought she was trying to prank me. She then said this wasn't a prank but I had already messed up her good humor. \n\nShe got angry and started to walk back home, i followed her and asked if it was true. She said yes, I got very happy and hugged her which I think made her a bit less angry. We picked our stuff and got back home. She told me that the doctors can't explain her pregnancy either, she has to do some tests so we still haven't told anyone, but she wanted me to know.

Holy crap that's awesome!", "NAH - I think this is a reasonable response to being told you're going to be a father by someone that told you they were infertile. Being shocked and in disbelief is a thing.", "NAH I can understand why she was hurt at first, but I don\u2019t think your reaction was unreasonable. Seems like you\u2019re both proceeding well after the fact, so no one is to blame.", "NAH. I've known so many people that have been told they're \"infertile\". Every single one of them has had at least one child. I've been told im infertile too but tbh I don't believe it.", "NAH in my opinion. I get why she was sad initially, but you weren\u2019t trying to be hurtful. I can see why you thought it was a joke. The doctors can\u2019t even explain it. Congratulations by the way!", "NAH   \n\n\nYour choice of words was less than optimal, but understandable.  In your place I would offer an apology then move on to the happy planning.", "NAH. Honest \"mistake\" if you even want to call it that. You had a reasonable reaction to something you thought was an impossibility. You're both happy now and that's what matters. You'll laugh about this eventually. And congrats!", "NAH.\n\nYour reaction is understandable, and so is hers. You thought she was joking but were actually happy about the news itself. She was being serious and was upset that you couldn't tell. Maybe you could plan a nice surprise for her to celebrate your news.

Its a bit shitty you insisted when she told you she wasn\u2019t joking but i can let it slide. And infertile does not mean 100% not able to get pregnant. It just means almost impossible.

I was working on a fishing boat in Alaska at the time and was getting sea sick, which I never got. Well during a big storm I was hanging over the railing wishing I could die when my captain convinced me and my husband to get a pregnancy test in Dutch Harbor. I told them I most likely had a brain tumor. Well I got the very expensive test at Eagles grocery and took it. I was so far along it went instantly pregnant and did not take the recommended 3 minutes. My brain shut off and I set it down, grabbed the company truck keys and started climbing over the other ships to get to the dock. Husband was following me trying to get me to tell my where I was going and what was wrong and I finally snapped and said I wanted my fucking 3 minutes. I took 3 more tests and none of them gave me my 3 minutes before it sunk in I was pregnant. I was already in my second trimester \ud83d\ude02.

Hopefully in a few years you can laugh about it.", "NAH. \n\nI get your reaction, and I get her reaction to your reaction. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, but unfortunately this didn't go the way your fiancee hoped it would.

That you didn't mean to ruin a very special moment for her - for both of you- and that you hope she knows that you love her. Give it a pause, and then say how excited you are for the baby, this is miracle, and all that fun stuff. \n\nSometimes, even when we do nothing wrong, we apologize because the bigger thing is making sure the person we hurt is okay and can move on, regardless of how this all happened.

Kids are a total gamechanger and I'm sure you'll do just fine.", "If she handed you an ultrasound it would have her name and date it was done on it and her birth date I'm going with YTA", "YTA not for your initial surprise but for the repeat questioning. Literally why do you think your gf would PRANK you with this??", "NTA, but she still deserves an apology. No one likes being doubted by their partner, and you did ruin the surprise. Make sure to give her lots of hugs and support from here on out.", "I have PCOS and went through IVF and multiple surgeries was told I would never get pregnant. Got cancer and a few years after that did a pregnancy test that came out positive was so sure my cancer had become metastatic but no after 18 years of trying my husband and I had a successful pregnancy and at 32 weeks our son decide it was time. I was the one that reacted badly at first as I was sure it was my cancer returning. Congratulations!", "NTA. She can't expect you to go from one extreme to the other like that. She should have told you about the doctor's appointment and then shown you the sonogram. You had no frame of reference for it, because she'd always been infertile, as far as you knew. Stop feeling bad, and start getting ready for a baby. Congratulations!", "My SIL was told after her second child was born that due to complications with the pregnancy and birth, it would be impossible for her to have any more children naturally.\n\nBaby #3 was a surprise to everyone.\n\nI\u2019m going with YTA - not for being shocked or surprised, because that\u2019s understandable, but because even after she told you **twice** it was your baby you accused her of stealing a photo from google to play a prank.\n\nYou ruined the moment she never dreamed she would get to have.", "NAH. I ruined my pregnancy announcement to my husband by coming out of the bathroom with a positive test and showing it to him when he was cooking dinner and screaming \u201cwhat the fuck is this!?\u201d (We were trying and we\u2019re fortunate that it happened so quickly.) You guys will laugh about this later. Congratulations!", "NAH.\n\nIf you've been told repeatedly she can't get pregnant, it's understandable that you'd be a bit flummoxed when she tells you she's pregnant.", "NAH\u2014congrats!!", "NAH you didn't have a bad reaction, you had an incredulous one.\nI honestly thought you were going to respond with \"oh nooo a baby?! I thought you were infertile, how the ** are we going to manage\" or something like that.\n\nYour reaction is completely understandable and she'll laugh about it later on.\n\nBe sure to pamper her, though. Pregnancy is a hormone storm to begin with, and she has issues with her reproductive system. She's not going to have an easy time.", "NTA. Your reaction was the natural response.  Her being angry at you for believing she wasn\u2019t pregnant when she had told you she couldn\u2019t get pregnant is bizarre. I guess hormones must be affecting her emotions.", "NTA. I don't get the NAH judgments because she lied about being infertile and then surprised a kid on you.\n\nGF is an asshole, you're not.", "NAH congrats on the baby!", "Something doesn't add up here.  I see a lot of comments about infertile not being the same as sterile but the fiancee seemed to act as though she couldn't get pregnant by not using birth control.\n\nSo the person who literally talked to the doctor and would have the best understanding of what it meant or what it could mean switched to unprotected sex while explaining protection wasn't needed.\n\nThen she becomes pregnant and grows angry at the confusion and wanting to understand what happened.\n\nNTA and I'd look into a DNA test.", "It\u2019s either Y T A or N A H imo. You knew she could get pregnant, but that it was unlikely. Your comments show that.

I was told I was infertile as a teen due to endometriosis. I ended up pregnant but miscarried. Got pregnant again 3 yrs later and carried the baby to term even though I was still being treated for endometriosis. I underwent more treatments and was told that I had too much scar tissue and was infertile. Well, that's when I got pregnant with my 1st set of twins. (3 kids now) 2 surgeries later and being put into menopause (so birth control pills were not an option) I specifically asked if I had any risk of pregnancy. I was again told I was infertle. Guess what... I got pregnant (while in menopause) with my 2md set of twins. Had a bunch of complications, and they do not share the same birthday, but that brought the total up to 5 so far. Still had bad endometriosis after my youngest of the twins was born. Nothing seemed to help. A few yrs later, the last of my kids were born (6 kids in total). After that one, I had a hysterectomy during my c section. I asked the doctor jokingly, \" Now, I am completely infertile now, right?\" They said,\"No, now you are completely sterile.\" 10 yrs between my oldest and youngest kid and 3 doctors later, NO ONE ever told me the difference, until my hysterectomy. Evidently, infertile means that there is a possibility greater than zero that you could have a biological child. Sterile means zero chance.", "IKR?

Ugh.", "Are you *me*?  SAME!  Literally conceived ON our wedding night.", "Thank you!", "Nah, you just made it sound like they go to her doctor together.  \"Doctor's responsibility to explain to OP\" where OP is the dude.

I understand you were probably in shock but you might want to do something nice for your partner to make her feel like you are really excited for this little human.", "NTA. Given the history I don\u2019t think your reaction was an AH one. One of shock and then happy surprise. Make it up to her with a lovely day doing something she likes and maybe buy her a gift for the baby. It\u2019ll be ok! Congrats!", "My sister was diagnosed with secondary infertility because she had two children and couldn\u2019t get pregnant again even though they never used birth control. She was almost 40 when she started feeling really weird. Turned out she was pregnant! She had issues and the baby was premature but she is 24 and quite healthy now.

Clearly a big moment for her which she may NEVER get again. Who jokes about that in this day and age. Your very lucky and I\u2019m happy for you but please step up your game.", "NTA. Pretty poor way to tell your partner that you (infertile) are pregnant.", " I\u2019m not a doctor but I always have a hard time imagining a doctor saying that you\u2019ll never be able to have children. I don\u2019t think they say that, even when it\u2019s true. They say it\u2019s time to try donor eggs or surrogacy.

Keep in mind that she had a bit more time to process the news, since she found out before you did. You just needed to get past the initial shock, which is pretty normal when unexpected life changing events happen. Oh and congratulations!", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI'll never understand why so many women expect men to instantly be ecstatic when finding out about an unexpected baby.  I'm fairly sure that many of them took some time to sort through their emotions when first finding out for themselves.", "Haha same! I was told I\u2019m infertile when I was 19.

We got pregnant on the night we consummated our marriage. \n\nSadly baby didn\u2019t survive first trimester, but we were pregnant again within 6 weeks. (didn\u2019t think it was possible) ((yes we are well educated, I should have known better)). \n\nI was still breastfeeding, had not really had a period yet and was on a mini pill that I took daily at 7am (Never skipped or take it late), and we got pregnant anyway. Baby is due in June \ud83e\udd23we are very happy. But clearly i am very much the opposite of infertile.", "The latter", "Yes! Not only explain detail but make sure the patient understands. It sounds like she was really young when she was told and she probably thought the same thing the majority of us think\u2026 she can\u2019t get pregnant.

If you can\u2019t believe what your partner tells you then why would you even be with them. For the record, my doctor told me it would probably take us longer second time around because of X, Y and Z. 6 weeks later I was back in her office, pregnant with twins. It happens.

Neither of you had any reason to believe she could be or get pregnant. \n\nNAH.", "I'm a woman in her late 30s and I take my husband with me to many doctor's appointments and medical procedures. In my case, after long enough dealing with chronic issues, I found that doctors will listen to him when they won't listen to me. I hate it and I wish it weren't the case, but wheels start turning the moment my husband requests things or shares how much pain he's seen me in.", "So, why did you question of the OP knew for sure? I can\u2019t quite work out what you are trying to say here.", "That fucking sucks.  Please tell me that the doctors are at least old and we can blame this on the time they grew up in that made that behaviour acceptable... Because otherwise, that REALLY fucking sucks to hear.\n\nNotice you're a scrub?  Do you work in healthcare as well?  Because on top of those things, FUUUUUCK!!!!", "I think it can also be helpful to bring someone with you who's job is to help make sure that you actually have the information you need by the end of the appointment. Remember reading about someone's experience with cancer where they basically came out of the phone call where they got the diagnosis with none useful information because they were (understandably) too upset to listen to the rest of what the doctor said or ask any questions of their own.", "yup sucks being a woman in America", "I bring my partner because it's his native language. We get some odd looks from judgy doctors but even though I speak the language well, I'll never forget the time I misunderstood the instructions and my armpits swelled up. So yeah, he tags along, just in case.", "I think it was about 50/50 on older vs younger doctors. I've seen older doctors who have listened and younger ones who think they know best. I've had female doctors who don't seem to believe me when I talk about my pain and male doctors who do. A young female doctor once denied my request for birth control because of her religion. There's really not a clear pattern, it's just a crapshoot. I wish I could have stayed with the good doctors I've seen, but with health insurance being tied to employment and with lateral moves to other companies resulting in better money than just staying where you are, we've had to switch all of our health stuff up every 3 to 5 years. Then it's another round of the crapshoot. \n\nThe dumb thing is that I've never even requested really heavy pain meds. The riskiest thing I ever even got was just prescription strength ibuprofen and I was so relieved, I cried in front of the doctor, who told me he felt bad he couldn't do more. My requests were things like getting the approval for physical therapy so insurance would cover it. Or not trying epidural shots for the third time when there's an outpatient surgery with good shots at working and a low risk rate."]}
