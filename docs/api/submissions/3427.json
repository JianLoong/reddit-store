My husband didn't come because he said he had a meeting dinner with some clients. This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.\n\n\n\nTo my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.\n\n\n\nMy parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said \"I don't think so, I'm busy right now\". I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up.\n\n\nHe sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home.\n\n\nHe was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable.\n\n\nWe argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all.\n\n\nFYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story.\n\nAlso it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink.

You went up to him, against the better knowledge that he apparently decided not to come over and ask him anyways.

He was at WORK.", "YTA, apart from a wave of acknowledgment, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything more out of me. He was working and you tried to scold him, demanding he join your family. Do you turn up to his place of work and order him about as well? Your actions show zero respect for his career and him as a person.", "YTA. This was so cringe it was hard to read. How embarrassing for your husband!", "YTA and if I were your husband, I'd be incensed with you as well.  This was extremely disrespectful and immature on your part.  The fact that you can't see that us extremely concerning.", "YTA, he was working. You interrupted his work to blow out candles. You embarrassed him in front of his clients and made it awkward for everyone. You acted selfishly.", "YTA \n\nWhy not trust your husband? some people especially older would take offense at being left alone like that even for a couple of minutes. It doesn't really matter that it's the nice thing to do when you could potentially hurt his business for a piece of cake. You assume they wouldn't mind but really you should consider the damage you could impart on his image. \n\nAnd let me say again: It doesn't matter if it's the nice thing to do, some people wouldn't want to do business with you for the stupidest reasons.", "He\u2019s right, your behavior was absolutely ignorant. He was in a meeting and you behaved as if he were hanging out with friends. YTA and you and your family owe him a major apology.", "YTA. If he was there on a lunch break with coworkers, I'd get it. But clients? A business meeting? I would be mortified if I was anyone in your family, a client, or your husband. That's so embarrassing.", "YYA. If you were going to go over and talk to him, you should have done it when you first arrived. Then maybe sent some cake over to the table for him and his clients. Standing there interrupting his meeting saying \u2018excuse me\u2019 when he had made it very clear he didn\u2019t want to be disturbed is just very odd. \nYou owe him an apology.", "YTA\n\nHe was working. It was a business meeting, he wasn't out socializing.\n\nYou interrupting him during his meeting gave *me* second hand embarrassment. Idk why you thought he was available just because he was in the same restaurant as you.\n\nGaruntee if you hadn't said anything and let him be, he would have came over after his meeting was done.", "MAJOR YTA are you kidding me??\n\nWhen he already declined, your offer it was clear enough he couldn't attend your *sister's* birthday wtf.\nWhy are you acting so entitled.\n\nProfessionalism is a thing, you might as well have costed him his clients", "YTA\nAt 26, you should definitely know better than that. Your husband was at a work meeting. Which means he needs to maintain professionalism and, by extension, so does his wife. I would have been absolutely mortified if my spouse did that to me and we would have been fighting. Your behavior was highly inappropriate and it sounds like your parents, who are plenty old enough to know better, condoned it. You likely jeopardized your husband\u2019s professional standing and if you don\u2019t understand, you need some real world experience.", "I got secondhand embarrassment for your husband just reading this. And I\u2019m not trying to be mean by saying that, I just want to emphasize how to a lot of people, you look like TA. \n\nI think your insistence really does it in. By your description you definitely picked up on nonverbal clues that he needed you to stop.\n\nI think this is certainly a situation where if you don\u2019t know, sending a text is a nice discreet way of figuring out what kind of meeting he\u2019s having and if it\u2019s the kind of meeting you should interrupt in anyway.", "YTA! He was at work, how awkward for the clients! This put him in such a shit position.", "he was obviously in an important business meeting and you interrupted it, embarrassed him, and ruined it. for a candle blowing? YTA.", "Yta...I don't like being interrupted while working. Unless someone is dying idgaf what my family is doing while I'm working.", "Yta. Couldn't you just have wanted for him to wish your sister happy birthday after ? You're pathetic for thinking that your sister's little moment of glory triumphs over his work. You basically forced him to be in an uncomfortable spot having to pick between work and your little sister. Think before pushing people on the edge please.", "YTA . I don\u2019t know how you weren\u2019t embarrassed yourself walking up and interrupting a work meeting for a birthday. Whether or not you think you did anything wrong, the people he was meeting with were 100% judging you for the interruption. You made clients sit and wait while you all sang Happy Birthday, rude.", "YTA, if you wouldn't have taken your sister to his workplace to have your party at his desk in front of his boss and coworkers,  then I don't see how you could have thought that this would have been any more appropriate. He was at work, even people who work from home are to not be interrupted when they're working, I think it's safe to say that a meeting in a public place should have been treated with the same courtesy.", "Are you serious?? Totally, 100% YTA. Holy shit.", "YTA. He was having a client meeting. What on earth were you thinking?! Totally selfish and irrespecutful from you and your family to interrupt.", "YTA. You didn't know who the clients were and how important this meeting was for his company, career and reputation. You made him look unprofessional. You shouldn't have forced yourself into his meeting even though he ignored you which should have been an indicator for your that you shouldn't disturb him.", "YTA. It was a BUSINESS meeting. How can you all act so childish? It was so important for him to say happy birthday, yet NO ONE acknowledged that he could lose his job? You and your whole family were AH and quite childish imo.", "I dont believe this is real. People aren't this ignorant.", "YTA. Both you and your parents. Just because the man was at the same restaurant does not give you and your family permission to harass him and his meeting. You have no idea what repercussions await after this stunt.", "YTA. I get why you'd be a bit miffed that he didn't even acknowledge you but he's in the middle of an important meeting with his clients. Yes, it was more important at that moment than watching your sister blow out her candles. This isn't him refusing to get off Call of Duty for a few minutes, he's trying to put food on YOUR table.", "Yta and so is your family. He was WORKING. This is the equivalent of interrupting him at the office for a grown woman to blow out candles and take some selfies GROW UP. Your parents should have raised you better and told you and your sister what hes doing is important and shouldnt be interrupted for something as frivolous as blowing out her candles which I assume she could have done without his presence.", "Seriously?? YTA\n\nThis was a business meeting, not a group of his boys hanging out. You put him in an awkward situation and forcing him to leave in order to say Happy Birthday just to leave and end his business.\n\nIf it was him with friends, I wouldn't say too much, but this was working hours and you could have told your family the situation. You put him in a bad light for everyone and for what? I would have been furious if I was in your husband's shoes and this happened to me.\n\nGo and apologize to your husband and make a change. Stop putting him in a dilemma that isn't needed.", "YTA. I don't know what your husband does or what kind of meeting this was, but what *you* did was unacceptable. Just because you happened to be in the same place doesn't mean that he can drop *work* to celebrate. What you did likely made your husband seem unprofessional and dampened the client's views of him *and* the company as a result. It's not like they were just having a friendly get together. It was a *business meeting*, regardless of setting, and as such you should have minded your own business and not have interrupted at all. There could be serious repercussions for your husband if your interference impacted the meeting in some way. He wasn't ignoring you to be rude, he was doing so because he was *working*.", "You're a huge AH. You're rude and lack manners. You could see that he was clearly working and decided to interrupt because you thought candle blowing was more important. You need to grow up and stop acting entitled", "He should refuse to talk to you because YTA. Why would any of you think it's acceptable to interrupt his work (in front of clients!) for a piece of cake and a picture? He's pissed and he should be, not just for the intrusion, but for you dismissing him calling you and your out. ALL of you owe him a damn apology.", " YTA. As someone who is the wife of a husband who entertains clients often at high end restaurants, you must understand how networking, dinners, etc. affect business. They are working when at these events, it\u2019s not a social gathering of buddies. Your actions and those of your family made him look extremely unprofessional.", "This is so embarrassing how could you even think it was okay to type this out and then press post! YTA. You need to learn some healthy boundaries.", "YTA it was a business meeting relating to his work, NOT casual meeting with friends. You need to apologise to him and never do it again", "YTA. You sound childish as hell. He was in a business meeting. He was WORKING. He didn't acknowledge you when you waved because he was supposed to be focused; this wasn't some lunch with friends. That should've been a hint. You embarrassed him (& YOURSELF) & made him look unprofessional & immature. His business partners are going to come to their own conclusions on why the birthday party was held there. I hope they don't think your husband planned that...", "YTA - He was working. That means he is unavailable, even in the same room. I dont understand why this was a hard one to grasp.", "YTA he was working and having a meeting.\nImagine a Zoom meeting when you interrupt them just to say hello. Very fking embarrassing. YTA.", "YTA he wasn't there with hus buddies, it was WORK!", "Yta. I can't even fathom", "YTA. In a different scenario your husband would\u2019ve been in the same restaurant with another woman.

That's his and your livelihood you're messing with.", "YTA.. it was his business meeting.. you know, his livelihood that helps pay the bills? You can\u2019t just interrupt a business meeting for a birthday. He has every right to be pissed.", "I agree that he could have taken a moment to stop by and say hello and happy birthday, but he didn\u2019t which to me reads that he couldn\u2019t.

That was your sign to not go up to him.", "YTA\n\nI would be SO embarrassed. \n\nYou owe your husband a huge apology.", "YTA! He was in a work meeting! It's effectively like you barged into his office during a meeting and demanded he leave with you for a social event. His priority in that moment was his clients, and you decided to humiliate him in front of them due to your over inflated sense of importance. I hope this doesn't affect his career", "YTA.\n\nHe was WORKING not getting drinks with friends. What you did was very unprofessional and could have cost him greatly.

I absolutely hate business culture to high hell, but the fact of the matter is that you have to work with the culture in order to achieve a position where you can afford NOT working with the culture. In this case, your husband is at work and is still at the whim of the culture. That\u2019s a very serious culture of no-nonsense, no funny business\u2026it\u2019s very dull, frankly. Something like a birthday party is meant to be kept entirely out of work hours, and the fact that you\u2019re pulling him out of work hours for this party, if front of clients who are undoubtedly notable people in their firm, will say to them that the party is more important than their business. That can genuinely endanger deals with people. If this is a big deal that your husband is trying to close, which will undoubtedly earn him his own level of bonuses or commission as a result of his work, you could have genuinely taken money out of his paycheck if that endangers the deal. By all means, this culture sucks and taking a minute for a relatives birthday party shouldn\u2019t have this level of sway over whether you get paid or not. But it does, and until we can change the culture we have to work with it.", "Holy YTA. How clueless can someone be? He was at work. The sensible thing to do would have been to wait for his clients to leave and then go up to him and ask that type of stuff", "WOW. Uh, yeah YTA.\n\nWhat you did is the equivalent of walking into his office and into a meeting room while he's hosting clients. Then, asking him to pause their discussion because you want to ask him what he wants for dinner.\n\nHe was WORKING. You are seriously entitled if you think that interrupting a business appointment is justified by you both being in the same building.", "I guess you never had a professional job with clients and all?

Shame on you.", "YTA - I can\u2019t believe you would do that while he was having a dinner meeting with clients.  You made him look Completely unprofessional and embarrassed him in front of clients.

My husband didn't come because he said he had a meeting dinner with some clients. This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.\n\n\n\nTo my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.\n\n\n\nMy parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing but he barely let out a phrase and said \"I don't think so, I'm busy right now\". I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motioning for me to hurry up.\n\n\nHe sat with us while my sister blew the candles, and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selifie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed.

Your husband d said he couldn't attend for a valid reason and that was work related and that should have been respected and followed.\n\n I'm not in a business world but I had a father who taught me and my brothers etiquette on work situations long before we ever had our own jobs and one of them was under no circumstances is it ok to interrupt a business meeting in public or private unless it's a dire emergency, you are personally requested to attend or be present..it would've been very different matter if your husband excused himself of his own accord and came to you and introduced you to his clients, colleagues or whatever they were than requested to quickly go  and say say Happy birthday to your family member then went back to his table promptly. He more than likely felt embarrassed, on edge and disrespected by the whole experience.\n\nI have a work persona, a public persona and one that is only used with my family. Work and public are sometimes similar but there is slight differences when I see my husband while I am working or if I visit where he works we not approach each other unless we give a certain visual signal that says it's ok to do so. Everyone has there own cues in different settings. More often that not we will excuse ourselves for a moment permitting the situation and or introduce one another to our respective colleagues if they haven't met either of us but only if we feel it's acceptable to do that. \n\nNever once have I just walked up to him working in any environment and asked him to stop his job to please family, friends or myself because we both understand work is a job and one that if you interrupt at the wrong time it can be taken against you and depending on where that job is they could even penalize a person for doing what you pushed your husband to do. Some environments do not want to mingle personal lives in with business and from the sounds of it that was the situation surrounding his meeting and your family members birthday party.\n\nNext time respect his wishes, if you had waited for a while he may have had plans to come to the table after he conducted his meeting if the party was still ongoing.

Looking back, I wish I\u2019d seen it for the red flag that it was. YTA", "I get the feeling the husband knew it wouldn't be a quick, \"Hello, funny we picked the same restaurant, anyways happy birthday!\" He tried to convey to her not to bother him because he knew she would derail the whole evening as much as possible.", "Acknowledging his family would be best but the time table definitely depends on the husband. We don't know the nature of the meeting or where in the meeting they were when this all happened. There can be a big difference between \"So I think Bill's a great guy and we should definitely bring him up into management if everyone is in agreement\" and \"Sales continue to fall so we're going to have to make considerable cuts across the board\" when you get interrupted for a birthday party. Or, since they're clients \"You guys are doing great, thanks for getting those files to us so fast you saved us\" vs \"Your incompetence almost ruined everything, can you promise us that you can maintain a professional atmosphere and keep things moving going forward?\"", "That's probably because you are a polite down to earth person. Yet there are a whooole bunch of people who are not. Who feel they are most important and have huge egos. Lot of clients would not in fact take this kind of interruption in stride but would be insulted. And you still have to work with those people.", "It sounded like the old \"enlisted vs officer wife\" to me.

Doubt that will happen.", "Yea when he didn\u2019t wave back OP should have taken the hint. Husband wasn\u2019t there with friends, this was work.", "I agree that both of them could have handled this a lot better, but we know absolutely nothing about the meeting and what it was about.  Maybe the circumstances really tied his hands in some way.  Maybe this deal was super important to the company and they had problems with meetings being interrupted unprofessionally in the past and he was there as a last attempt to prove that his company was a good fit.  Who knows but the way he reacted implies something was up, and that he was really uncomfortable and/or worried.\n\nOP should have left their table alone until after the meeting was over.  You don\u2019t interrupt a business meeting you know nothing about - and try to pry the guy leading it away.  Wait until the meeting is over and walk over then - or wait until he does", "Except doing so could be viewed negatively by the clients too. He was in a rock and a hard place because they could view him stepping away to prioritize his family as not giving them his full attention. The safest course is simply finishing the dinner meeting and not mixing the two at all but he didn't get to make that choice since OP made it for him waving and then going and interrupting.", "This is a key point.\n\nClient meetings can be so stressful. Then to have your family celebrating nearby as a complete surprise -- I would have totally frozen up. He was probably at a loss for how to navigate an incredibly awkward situation.", "The fact that he didn't get up could have meant that he didn't want his family exposed to these particular business associates. They could have been hard money lenders, come loan sharks or any other kind of undesirable business associate that are marginally appropriate to do business with but not to fraternize with otherwise.\n\nLiterally anything could have been going on here but the husband said no and she kept on insisting, like that birthday party was the most important flipping thing in the entire world.\n\nOP is definitely YTA.", "Yeah. Like, in many client situations I do think he could've found a way to go say hi. But either these weren't the clients to do that with, or he's not smooth enough to figure out how to do it well. Either way, once he didn't wave back, that was the signal to the wife to just leave him alone to do his work in peace.", "OP's post made me uncomfortable by how awkward the husband must have felt in that moment.\n\nI occasionally run into my dad where we'll be in the same restaurant and it's easy to read when I can say hi or not. Generally, I just let my dad introduce me to his clients if I don't know. I don't think I could ever say HAY DAD COME EAT CAKE while he was in a meeting though, regardless of if they were his friends or just clients, that's just rude. \n\nHonestly, OP's lack of planning is not the husband's problem and she should have just let it go.

I would have also been pissed in his shoes.", "Seriously, pretend he doesn\u2019t exist and make everyone else do the same. After the meeting give him the cake at home or wait at the bar to give it to him. It isn\u2019t his daughters birthday\u2014 it\u2019s his sister in law.

Sometimes it may be fine to go away for 5 minutes, sometimes it may be awkward, and some other times it may even be unacceptable. \n\nThere are also many kinds of people among clients.

He stops and turns briefly. \n\n\u201cOh, one more thing John.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d John replies, hope building. \n\n\u201c\u2026Happy birthday.\u201d", "I have lunch/dinner meetings all the time.

Would you have interrupted an in office meeting as well?", "That's definitely enough time for clients to decide to take their business elsewhere.", "Chances are these clients are taking time away from their family as well to conduct this dinner, why drag out their dinner and possibly feel guilty that they've deprived the husband of his SILs celebration at best.

So awkward. If I had unexpectedly seen my partner where he's in a professional setting, I'd subtly wink at him and save him a slice of cake for later at home. We'd later laugh about seeing each other and nobody else noticing haha! Going *to the table* was horrible judgment on OP's part.", "It should have been the end before it started.

OP should have put two and two together when she made eye contact and he didn't wave her over.", "She shouldnt even of walked over to his table in the first place. Apparently she cant differentiate business and personal. She knew about the meeting. She should have let it be.", "What part of no don't you understand.", "It also shows a complete and total disregard for the clients\u2019 time. 5-7 minutes is not actually a short amount of time to be sitting around waiting for someone in the context of a business meeting.

I have no issue with a person taking time for their family, but not at my expense, like reschedule the meeting and lets get together when you can actually keep your focus on the purpose of the meeting. \nIn a business meal setting a nod or slight wave when bumping someone at the restaurant is the way to go.", "\"Every no is just one step closer to a yes!\" - salesmen, rapists, and socially oblivious people alike", "Plus the tables were line of sight, so the clients would be sitting there, waiting for him, watching him do family things when he should be there attending to their requirements.  That 5-7 minutes would have felt like an eternity to the husband, and the clients.", "I don\u2019t know why she thought marching over to his table and interrupting the meeting was a brilliant idea. Why didn\u2019t she just text him - that at least wouldn\u2019t my have disrupted her husband\u2019s business.", "Here\u2019s the thing. Chili\u2019s is the new golf course. It\u2019s where business happens.", "Oh no!!", "The simple fact she made that post shows she doesn\u2019t understand the problem and the dynamic, or that she might have fucked up her husband\u2019s career.", "Oh I know! Anytime I'm in a situation like that I always say \"why bother asking me if my answer doesn't matter?\" boom instant AH. But seriously why bother.", "Agreed, if he is near your age 26 or even older clients can be prickly. Is he entertaining them for a bigger boss? I've seen people get fired for less than this. If you trust your husband's word even a little and you have not working in that industry for that company, you need to take his word.", "Your boss is (was I hope) a total jerk for threatening to fire you!", "I'm surprised OP hasn't already mentioned the venue where the party was going to be held to the husband. Seems mad that they never realised they would be there at the same time. OP is deffo TA", "Exactly this. The husband is the only one who knows if these clients are the type who will see him going over to say happy birthday to his SIL as refreshingly human and relatable, or unprofessional. So the family needed to let him make his own call on it and not interfere.\n\nI\u2019m in zoom meetings all day and I know which people would be thrilled to see my cat barge in and prance in front of the camera and which would find it unprofessional", "When I regularly had meetings like this, I had a favorite spot. Food was good, service was amazing. Restaurant was just noisy enough that not everyone could hear your conversation but not so noisy that you had to scream. Big bonus was I got to know the waitstaff. They would go heavy on the ice in MY drink so it appeared I was \"keeping up,\" but no chance of me becoming tipsy. They also treated the client like royalty.  These were usually one on one meetings with opposite gender...and it was kind of a small town. So many rumors about my dinner \"dates.\" Whatever. My partner and I laughed about it all of the time. \n\nFortunately, even the nosy neighbors had the sense to leave me alone, unlike OP. \n\nA part of me hated that COVID put a halt to those dinners. I feasted!! And I genuinely liked the clients. Even though I have since changed jobs completely,  a couple of my old clients have reached out when in town so we can catch up.", "I need to know why she brought you a bouquet of flowers two days in a row. Why would this ever be necessary? Why does she have so much time for flower shopping and unexpected work visits for a friend?", "Right !! Then she will be pissed when she has to work her little hands if he doesn\u2019t get those clients \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And an asshole", "Agreed \u2014 This would be a good way to handle it.\n\nBut\u2026 depending on the level of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d occurring in the meeting, I don\u2019t think it would be out of line for the guy to lean into it, and invite the clients to eat cake too, or something.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in research consulting for several years (Medical products), and I\u2019m trying to think how I would have reacted in the husband\u2019s position. Some of my clients would have laughed and wanted to join just because the experience is different, you know? Sort of like a \u201cwhy the hell not?\u201d The younger groups in particular (but probably not some of the older, executive folks). But then again, only if there were like 2 clients\u2026 if it were more, it would feel like I\u2019m wasting their time, I guess.\n\nThen, I think about some clients from Olympus (Japan division). No way in hell they would have done business with me afterward. They would have politely put up with it, or ignored it. But I would have never heard from them again, I bet.\n\nI guess my point is: context matters, and not every \u201cbusiness meeting\u201d is \u201cserious\u201d, even with clients. But to your point: let the dude in the meeting set the tone.", "Absolutely. For some kind of contacts it could even be a good endearing look - see how smooth this person is, he can connect and balance such different groups and make working with him a pleasure - but for other contexts breaking up the flow for unrelated stuff could be a big faux pas and disrespect. So he sets and broadcasts the tone and you have to pick up what he is putting out there. And it sounds very unambiguous that the vibe was 'DO NOT ENTER, PEOPLE AT WORK' lol.", "I can just imagine the other 3 dudes like sooooo\u2026.. this isn\u2019t awkward at allllll.", "Yeah, not everyone can navigate seamlessly. This is a very good point!!"]}
