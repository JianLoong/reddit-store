They declined.\n\nI get that they\u2019re kids and they\u2019ve just lost their mother which is a horrible loss. But you\u2019ve done nothing wrong here.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou invited them. They declined. I don\u2019t understand why they expected you to interpret their RSVP of No as a \u201cplease come beg us to come anyway.\u201d You\u2019re not psychic.\n\nI also don\u2019t understand why they \u201cfound out\u201d you got married on the date listed on the invitation that they clearly read and responded to. They already knew because you told them.", "From what I'm reading above I'm going to say NTA. It's been over a decade since you've divorced and it would appear that you have done your due diligence inviting them to the wedding.\n\nYou invited them before she passed away and they said no. Then they came back and asked you to change the date? Personal opinion as I've lost a parent recently: there is no specific timeframe for grievance but I think 2 months is not an inconsiderate timeframe. It's been over a decade since you were marriage ended and she has obviously moved on and I think you are in the right of moving on as well.\n\nFrom what you say above you did all the things you were expected to do in terms of dad stuff.", "NTA. I get they're grieving and may not want to celebrate much but I also don't know what they expect out of you. You had invited them, they declined. Two months after their mother died isn't terribly long, but you also didn't have your wedding immediately afterwards.", "NTA. This feels like a \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d situation. Had you followed up with them and asked repeatedly if they could come, they could have gotten mad at you for being insensitive and forcing them to get over their grief (this is just speculation based on their reactions). I think you did the right thing by respecting their decision and grieving process.\n\nCongrats on your wedding.", "NTA. Did they expect you to beg or something? They got invited, they declined. I'm sorry about their mom, but they shouldn't be directing their anger at you.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on your wedding.", "NTA. They RVSP'd they couldn't come, and anyone that's planned a wedding before knows they're not exactly easy to reschedule, even small ones. If they wanted alternative arrangements, and wanted to make it but couldn't because they were preoccupied with their mother's illness, they should have said something.\n\nAlso, this is a woman you've been divorced from for several years. I don't think anyone should expect you to put your life on hold because someone that's not in your life anymore passed away.", "NTA. They regret missing your wedding and are still raw from their mothers death so blaming you is the only logical thing they can think of.", "NTA - it's very unfortunate timing but you can't put your life on hold because someone is sick. I have divorced parents and whilst I would have been upset if one of them got married close to the death of the other, I am grown up enough to know that I can't expect a wedding to be postponed.", "NTA.\n\nI'm really not sure why your kids are conflating your marriage to their mom's death when you weren't married to her for MANY years.  The only thing I can come up with is that they're being irrational in grief.  There was no reason to invite them more than once.  I think this was a catch 22 situation.  No matter what you did, it would be wrong.  Even if you postponed the wedding, you'd have been wrong for even thinking about getting married so closely after their mom's death.  Perhaps because you're both their parents, they are connecting the two but it seriously doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nIf they bring it up again, remind them that she had remarried years ago, and even divorced before you even got engaged.  That her death really played no role in your life as your ex-wife.   That you're sorry for THEIR loss but that it didn't have any direct effect on your own life.  They need to understand that your life decisions stopped having anything to do with what was going on in their mother's life YEARS ago.", "NTA They are misplacing their grief. They need some counselling now. Have you been able to provide them with extra emotional support during their grief?", "NTA.\n\nThey said no and you respected that. What else are you suppose to do? I\u2019m sorry for the lost of their mom but there really isn\u2019t much you can do", "NTA. You deserve to move on in life and find happiness. I\u2019m guessing they are misplacing their grief and taking it out on you because you\u2019re the only parent left.", "NTA. Once the divorced finalized your ex's life was no longer your concern unless it impacted your children.\n\nJust keep in mind your kids are still grieving and probably had expectations that you would help in some regards in her final days, whether voiced or not.\n\nI won't call your kids AH's for how they acted due to extenuating circumstances ONLY, but only just.\n\nAnd congratulations on the new nuptials.", "NTA\n\nThey said no.", "OP, there is no way that you would know the date of her death. You are correct that you and your wife were not in any way required to postpone the date of your wedding for some unknown death date for a woman you divorced a decade prior. The fact that the wedding was two months after her death makes the fact that they are now blaming you for RSVPing no but are now upset that they weren't there is terrible. You are NTA", "NTA they rsvpd no. Not maybe.", "NTA", "Nta you invited them, they said no.  That's how invitations work.", "NTA- Why would you need to call and ask them to come when they already declined the invite? You made zero mention of changing the date, so why would they think the plan had changed? This sounds like a lose/lose situation for you and nothing you would have done would have made them happy (other than changing the date but as you mentioned I don't think you should have to change your plans for the death of someone who broke your trust and destroyed your marriage). Your children are grieving and perhaps their judgement is clouded because of that. I hope they eventually come around", "NTA. Your world doesn\u2019t stop because your cheating ex wife passed. It\u2019s very sad. I know what losing a mother is like. But it\u2019s ridiculous of them to expect you and your new wife to change your plans over this.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, it was months after the death, not days or weeks. It's not like the divorce was recent history, and she was battling cancer for a long time so there was no way for you to predict the timing relative to booking your wedding in advance.\n\nI might have tried reaching out to them one last time a week or two before the wedding, but like others have said, they may have reacted even worse to that.", "They're taking their anger/grief out on you.  Give this some time and hopefully they will get past it.  This is all so new to them.  It's a lot to deal with and it just look like in their eyes you moved on right after their mother died even though you all been divorced for years.  I would suggest maybe later on getting therapy for your kids.    \n\nNTA", "Info: when was the wedding date set? Was it set right after your ex wife passed and the wedding date was 2 months after her death?\n\nEdit: I just saw OP\u2019s edit. Invitations were sent out before the ex wife passed. NTA. Your wedding date was set, no reason to move it. Your children decided on their own not to go. Obviously they are grieving the loss of their mother and probably don\u2019t want to see their other parent get married right after she passed (I know, you divorced a decade ago but to the kids, I imagine they still don\u2019t want to see you married this soon to her death).", "NTA\n\nYou asked, they answered, you acted accordingly. If anything, they could have reached out and said hey, we changed our minds because XYZ\n\nThat being said, grief is hard and sometimes it makes people say or do nonsense. Maybe you can talk to them about it later, when things have settled a bit?", "Info:  how often were you in touch checking on them during their mom\u2019s last few weeks/months?  How did they learn of the wedding?  Did you call them or just send an invite in the mail?  Was the RSVP in person or did you receive that in the mail and not call? Were you not checking in on them in the days and weeks after their mom died?  \n\nI think you are NTA for going ahead with your wedding, but I\u2019m sensing that you may have not been supportive or in close contact with them during the most traumatic loss of their lives, and for that you may be an AH.", "Well I'm going to say NAH.  You are NTA as from what I'm seeing the date was set and invitations were sent before she died.  You didn't purposely get married 2 months after their mother died to hurt anyone.  I also don't think they are AHs for being hurt and grieving, I just think they are taking their pain out on you, which isn't fair, but I don't think it makes them AHs.  You clearly didn't set out to hurt them, this whole situation just hurts.  They need to find a way to work through the pain.  Congrats on the wedding/marriage.

You were gracious about it all.\n\nNow your kids feel you should have let them walk all over you just because they are grieving. Sorry but NO. The outside world moves on even though your world has gotten upside down with the death of a loved one", "NTA-I\u2019m sorry but it seems their anger is misplaced. They should be mad at the man, her current husband, that she left YOU for. Hopefully time will heal their wounds and they will realize how immature they are being. Congrats on the wedding!", "NTA.

They're grieving, and I empathize with them, but their grief is making them into assholes.", "Info:  what did you do to support your children in what was obviously a very difficult time with your life.

Yes, divorce was long ago but your kids lost their most loved person. Were you attentive to their emotional need? Could it be you were busy with your upcoming wedding and perhaps did not support them the way they needed? Just because they are young adults, doesn't mean they don't need that. Also, your kids probably thought about the fact they will get married one day without their mum there. I don't say you should have postponed, just asking if you have been sufficiently supportive before and after the biggest loss in their life, and what...getting a step mum right away? It's a big deal to lose your mum and any age, but early 20's? Rough!", "NAH.\n\n**But,** my parents separated in the early 90s, divorced a while after that. My dad died last September, and even though my brother and I are adults, my mum has been nothing but supportive of us. He was our dad and she knows we're grieving.", "NAH.\n\nI don't think that there is anything wrong with not postponing a wedding that was planned for 2 months after a death in the family.  Life does go on.  \n\nI also don't think there is anything wrong with grieving people opting out of family events if they don't feel like they are emotionally able to attend.  Self-care is important and everybody deals with grief differently and at different rates.  \n\nThe kids' reaction - declining the invitation, then getting mad that the wedding went forward and they weren't re-invited after they declined - this sounds like their grief talking, so I would give them some grace.  \n\nThe only real issue that I see here is the OP's hands-off approach regarding his ex-wife's illness.  His kids went through a major thing - their mom was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer when they were teenagers, was sick for years, step-dad left during her battle with cancer, and ultimately died a couple months ago.  My god that is a lot.  I may be missing some of the story, but it doesn't sound as though the OP was really there for his kids like they needed him during this time.  His getting married 2 months after the death of their mother may just be the event that illustrates how he has let them down these past years.", "NAH. Life doesn\u2019t stop when someone passes. \n\nMy father died of an aggressive form of cancer around the time I was graduating high school. It was a lot on my plate to finish school, work to help pay rent, maintain a semblance of social life, and dealing with other family members emotions. It just felt like one big life changing event after another. I would have said no to attending a wedding too. Your children needed a break from all these big life events, and that should be treated with some grace. \n\nCancer is a fickle bitch, and it\u2019s not something that you can easily plan around. \n\nPersonally, I would try to do a nice dinner out with your new wife and kids, down the road when they\u2019re ready. They lost their mother and they really just need some time to adjust to that giant change. Please be the parent they need, even if your feelings towards your ex clash against their vision of their mother.", "NAH \n\nBut honestly I get it. Their mum died and you\u2019re celebrating love (albeit with someone else) - they\u2019re your kids. Imo they should have come first (maybe you don\u2019t rearrange, but you discuss and compromise).", "YTA you don't sound you there for your children while they were grieving, yes she was an ex of a decade but she was also your children's mother doesn't that count for anything.\n\nYou sent wedding invitations 5 years ago and got married now.\n\nNot buying it.", "YTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t about you not having feelings for your ex anymore or being impacted by her death, this is about a father not caring that his children are hurting because their mother died.", "YTA.\n\nThe AH part has everything to do with your relationship with your kids, and virtually nothing to do with the wedding. There was certainly no obligation to postpone the wedding just because your ex died 2 months ago.\n\nBased on what you said, your kids RSVP'd no, and you didn't even reach out to them and call them, you just \"hoped\" they would change their minds. \n\nThere's honestly so much that doesn't add up, that I wonder how much more has been left out to make the OP look like less of an AH. The invitations were sent out before the wedding, but the reason the kids supposedly RSVP'd no is because their mother just died. Then the kids \"found out\" the OP got married - so apparently there was no contact between the OP and his kids for at least 2 months while they were grieving the loss of their mom. The kids even said the reason they were angry is because he never even bothered to call - which yeah, if you can't bother to call your kids and ask them to reconsider coming to your wedding at some point over the course of 2 months, you're an AH who clearly doesn't care much about your kids or their feelings.", "I'm going to say NAH.\n\nI don't think you were heartless for going through with the wedding, but I can see why your kids feel the way they do.  \n\nI don't necessarily think you are wrong for going ahead, but if you wanted your kids there, having your wedding 2 months after their mom's passing was not the way to do it.", "NTA", "NTA. You've done absolutely nothing wrong here.

Maybe you can see if there is some creative way you can fix this,  such as by having a small \"renewal of vows\" aka restaging the wedding at a time when your kids can attend (maybe a nice vacation altogether), or just a really sincere apology and a slice of wedding cake for each of them.  You aren't the AH here,  but reaching out to your grieving kids right now might make a big difference to all of you going forward.", "NTA. What did they want?

You were not in love with their mother and had zero obligation to put your life on hold.  \n\nLet yourself iff the hook.

They now only have one parent and your relationship with them is fundamentally different. It\u2019s hard to explain how but there\u2019s a mix of love, relief to still have their dad, sadness that they only have their dad, and sometimes guilt for favoring one or the other.  Sure, after a decade to you it makes sense to get remarried. But two months after such an intense loss would be devastating to them. My father died two years ago and I swear for the first three months I thought I\u2019d never be happy again. Even as I healed the whole first year was totally fucked. I would have been very hurt if mom, also divorced for over a decade, had remarried. I think I would\u2019ve eventually learned to celebrate her marriage but it would\u2019ve taken awhile. I totally understand them calling you upset for not re-inviting them. It\u2019s exactly the kind of irrational grief I would expect.

But like many young  people, they confused unconditional appeasement with unconditional love. In short, it was a shit test, and their dad (wisely) decided not to play their game.\n\nBut that said, if OP cares about maintaining a relationship with his children, he should help them find a grief therapist and then (once they've had a chance to process some of these feelings individually) ask them to do some group sessions.

And you can resent others who knew her but don\u2019t seem to be \u201cin pause\u201d too. It\u2019s hard to move foreward from that and the repercussions of it still manifest for me over a decade later. It\u2019s a unique pain that is difficult to deal with because you only lose your mom once- nothing prepares you for that :( so they are probably not handling their grief well.

They could have RSVP when they got them two months before mom died ...but they waited. That's on them.

The kids are not assholes, they are literally grieving.", "Sometimes people just misplace their grief", "Of course it matters, half of aita problems are rooted in communication issues.", "I understand the kids were horribly heartbroken over losing their mom, but that really has nothing to do with their dad.  They could have sucked it up one day for their dad.  I know from personal experience it can take years to get over the loss of a parent(s).  They can\u2019t put their life on hold the entire time, until they can full deal with the loss.", "> If this was a sudden death and the kids were reeling\n\nYou think you're not reeling after losing a parent to a long battle with cancer?", "> it\u2019s clearly some stupid shit they\u2019re doing in their grief \n\nYou can't assume this. No means no.\n\nWhen a woman says no she does not want to have sex with you, do you assume that its clearly some stupid shit she's doing coz she's not thinking straight? I should hope not. \n\nNo means no. His children told him no, and he was respectful of their boundaries.", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault if they thought he would hit the brakes on his whole wedding because of them. Do you think that a reasonable assumption for them to make without him expressly stating he would do that?", "He can still support his children and get married. I would never ask my mom to postpone something she had planned for two months after my dad died. Hell, I went to my husband's cousins wedding less than a month after my dad died. They said they would understand if we had decided not to go and I had considered it, but I had been looking forward to going. It wasn't easy, but my dad would not have wanted me to put my life on hold.", "If he were mad at them it would be different. He said he understood they didn\u2019t want to come and that\u2019s fine. They wanted him to reschedule or try to convince them or something. That\u2019s another story.", "I feel bad for ops kids seeing as the man I considered my father died a little over a month after my 18th birthday and the woman I considered to be my mother died November 2021 but the world doesn\u2019t stop because you lost a parent and it\u2019s not an excuse to be an ah either. Op did nothing wrong but the children are being really shitty for no reason.", "Good job latching onto one sentence and throwing out all context of the situation.", "Not for losing a mother at that age. Grief is different for everyone, but to lose such a key figure in your life that young is devastating and completely understandable that they wouldn't feel up to a wedding where they'd have to plaster smiles on their faces and pretend to be happy the whole day (they probably were, but depending on who was attending, there could've been many people offering the kids their condolences/pity faces which would obviously take them out of remembering to celebrate their fathers wedding). Yes it's unreasonable to postpone a wedding, though I'm sure the guests would've understood if OP explained why. Or for OP to have even suggested to the kids that if they don't want to attend the wedding, they understand and they'll do something together another day - maybe a family BBQ when they were feeling up to it. Not only did they lose a patent but to them it'll feel like their dad didn't even care about how much they were hurting.", "That one sentence colours your entire opinion of the situation and it shows.", "What's enough time for some is not enough time for others. They're also in University. They have a lot going on. I lost my mom when I was 36 and the entire first month I wanted to die. It was a while before I was alright. NAH. I don't blame anyone here. It's a bummer all around but the dad wasn't trying to be an asshole and the invitations did go out before she died. I don't think the kids are assholes either. They're grieving.", "Hardly. I have been through a terminal illness with family. Reeling means shocked, I do not think her death was a shock. Their father is separate from their mother. They cannot hold him to their timeline of grief when he is being reasonable in his actions. Their mother passed away two months ago from a long illness.  If it was hard for them to attend, that's fine, and their choice. It's too far to ask their father, who's wife cheated on him and left him a decade ago, to put his life on hold indefinitely. Being in limbo during a terminal illness is just that. Again, run on up to my previous sentence for context or die on this hill grabbing onto a sliver of it. It makes no difference to me.", "Are they behaving rational? No, but their mother just died. In this situation the kids are AH either. They are in mourning and in grief. The dad is still their parent. So if they bring it up again it is ridiculously inappropriate to emphasize how much it doesn\u2019t effect OP. Instead just he should just be a good parent and respond with compassion.", "Situationally dependent, but if they were over in the US, the diagnosis could literally ruin *his* life long after she died, as (I believe depending on what state they were in) it could cost them all marital assets after she dies to cover the medical bills. \n\nOP states they don't know more than it was the results of bills and inability to provide care. It's entirely possible this was a mutual decision that actually was able to improve her care, and not put him under serious financial burden.", "Sorry are you a parent? Because a good parent doesn\u2019t stop caring for their children once they turn 18. Just because someone isn\u2019t \u201cresponsible\u201d for their kids anymore doesn\u2019t mean they should abandon them?? I\u2019m 24 but I\u2019m still my parents\u2019 child so they treat me like I am their child.", "It's not uncommon for couples to divorce to avoid saddling one of them with the medical debt, but in those cases they'll still stay together caring for each other until the end.\n\nBut this one sounds like the other husband just completely bailed on all them and left his dying wife and their kids to fend for themselves.", "Yes.", "I'm nearly 50 and still feel that way sometimes.  I really miss being able to curl up in my mom's lap and have everything be okay in the world", "My husband\u2019s first wife was in the hospital for several months and they were always amazed that he showed up every night, still in his military uniform. The few times I\u2019ve been to the ER he stayed by my side until I left or the one time they told him to go home and shower before bringing me fresh clothes.", "Did you have a problem reading my question?", "God I remember that feeling. I was 48. Felt weird to think of myself as an orphan, but I was the only one left too", "i feel like you need to revaluate how you are comparing things because consent for sex and asking if your grieving kids are okay to attend your wedding are not the same in any way", "I don\u2019t know if petty is it. Grieving a parent lost too soon is extremely rough. I lost my mom 5 years ago to cancer, I was 33, and I don\u2019t know how I would have handled this. It\u2019s a really rough time, I still struggle now, I was a mess then, My brother got married a couple months later, but that felt different, he also lost my mom. \n\nI\u2019m not saying they were right, I\u2019m saying they are deeply grieving, and rsvpd the day after she died. I don\u2019t know what I did the day after my mom died, but I would hate to be held accountable for it, as I was in deep dark sorrow. \n\nPeople might disagree, but I say NAH. He had every right to move forward with the wedding, they get space to decline and feel very up and down emotions. They may apologize later after the worst part of grief, and I would encourage OP to accept it and all move forward.", "Okay, I agree that OP is NTA and his kids didn\u2019t deal with this maturely\u2026 but let\u2019s not put a timeline on people\u2019s grief. Their mom died two months before their dad got remarried and fair or not, logical or not, of course that exacerbates their grief. Two months is not as long as you think it is, not when it comes to death.", "Of course they were being petty, they just lost their mother", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Sorry, paying child support is not something you \u201cgo through\u201d, it\u2019s your responsibility. He also never mentioned losing the kids in any capacity. How did she fuck him over by dying? So sorry cancer was inconvenient? I\u2019ll postpone?  This comment is nonsense", "Sounds like he still had some custody, maybe I'm wrong. Child support is just part of him being a dad. \nBut when my brother died I was just barely able to get back to just functioning 2 months later. \nIt's not on him but they could have asked him to postpone, doesn't sound like they asked just switched to being mad.", "The whole alimony system needs a complete overhaul. \n\nIf you leave someone for another person, the person you divorced should not have to pay you a monthly allowance.", "My kid was sitting right in front of it and nothing was touching it. She thought we were messing with her by turning it on via the app.\n\nI don't even have the app...and my husband was asleep\ud83e\udd23", "It is always a shock when a parent dies young, even after a lengthy battle. You absolutely reel from it. \n\nHe is their father. No, he doesn\u2019t owe them anything I suppose. But they don\u2019t owe him anything either. I just can\u2019t imagine my mom getting married two months after my dad died with the state we were all in. The grief was palpable for months. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d have been able to happily celebrate anything. Clearly these young children of OP are still deep in their grief and he doesn\u2019t seem to care much about that."]}
