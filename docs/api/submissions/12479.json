She's taking her anger out on innocent children. She's a grown adult with agency, these kids did nothing wrong and do not have the agency to change the circumstances here. I can, like you, analyze her circumstances and assume how she might be feeling about it to explain her actions and empathize with that. But now do the same for those children. They've either spent most of their life knowing or recently find out that they're a mistake to their father, a product of an affair, and he's too busy playing happy family with the wife and child he cheated on in the first place to give a shit about them as much more than a financial obligation. Their mother is dying, and they suddenly have to live with their fathers Other Family, with the stepmother that resents them and the older sister who was good enough for their father to raise. And then they get snide comments from all their new family about how they're not as good as their older sister, reinforcing the rejection they feel. They're being bullied by grown adults because of something that they have 0 control or input over. Thank goodness OP stood up for those girls, they clearly need more people in their corner telling them that they are beautiful and amazing and enough, and none of this literal sins of the father bullshit makes them lesser. I hope OP and her sisters are able to have a beautiful relationship despite the ugliness of OP's parents.", "Well done OP for being kinder, having better manners, and much more class than ANY of the adults in this story.\n\nYou felt sympathy for children who are stuck in a situation they not only didn't choose, ie being born, but in the situation they would never choose; they lost their mom, they're grieving and emotionally orphaned, and they've had to move into the house of the 'father' they barely know, the sister they never met, and the woman who hates that they exist.\n\nAnd then they get picked on relentlessly for something else they can't control - the way they look.\n\nYou didn't choose to start the confrontation. They did. Like a pack of Mean Girls attacking children, they really didn't expect you to be as awesome as you are.\n\nMaybe do a general notification to everyone:\n\n\"All points bulletin: I will not address last week's unpleasantness, because it won't be helpful, except to say that I'm really sorry the celebration was affected and I'm looking forward to meeting our new special family member.\n\n\"This message is to everyone in my family. I have two sisters. No matter how they got here they are my sisters. They are grieving, have had bad stuff happen to them that they didn't deserve and no children should have happen to them, and are almost alone in this world. But they are not alone. I will stick up for and care for my sisters. Because that is who I am. Their big sister.\n\n\"I expect you all to act with kindness and, if you can't, to keep it to yourself.\n\n\"Love to you all, OP\".\n\nIn so many ways, NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are 100% completely in the right here, not only for calling them out and defending your sisters (when you would have every reason to have not bonded with them and care for them) but you also raised the issue in what sounds like a very mature and respectful manner. I'm only sorry that the adults around you were not equally mature and respectful.\n\nYour dad needs to step up and put a stop to this it should never have gotten to this point, and while I have sympathy with your mother for the circumstances around their conception, these two children are innocent and she agreed to take them in, if it was beyond her ability to let the past go and treat these grieving children as equal, she should not have agreed to take them in the first place. All the other adults in this are definitely AH for bullying children, except your grandma.\n\nKeep doing what you are doing, I'm sure your sibling are grateful for having you as an ally and hopefully you will all grow to have a great relationship with eachother.", "YOU DID THE RIGHT THING \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe- TAKE MY STANDING OVATION \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nYour mother is understandably hurt, but she revoked her mean girl rights once those children came into your home. She\u2019s had 12 years to process this prior. She needs therapy now, alone and couples with your dad. \n\nYou are an amazing human to show compassion and relate - surpassing past pains and slights. You are an example imho Humans struggle with standing up for others when there\u2019s risk to themselves or no gain. Humans struggle with being kind when hurt or betrayed. You really are a special human imho. Make sure you\u2019re getting support too, not have your rightfully difficult experience pop up later to bother you. \n\nNTA - and good luck, it\u2019s a horrible situation your Dad has put you in. His apology is a start - I\u2019d talk to him re. therapy, and getting his guilt out and addressed with the appropriate person (his wife he cheated on). He cannot let her take it out on the kids and she deserves to mourn and be angry at what he\u2019s done, but also tools to move forward with the choices she\u2019s made or reconsider. In no way is taking it out on kids ok, she\u2019s being a mean girl to CHILDREN WHO DID NOT CHOOSE THIS + ARE LOSING THEIR MOTHER + HAVING TO LIVE WITH THE MAN WHI ABANDONED THEM AS ILLEGITMATE.\n\nIt\u2019s making your parents cruel if they don\u2019t check themselves. And it\u2019s fair as their daughter to point out they\u2019re becoming lesser versions of themselves when they can very well correct course here. You don\u2019t want to lose the warmth, integrity and bond of your family - when they\u2019re meant to be adding to it and the twins need them and you now. Maybe it would be cathartic to come together, and that\u2019s up to them getting help first. Trust me, as a parent, the only person whose opinion matters is my kid. Nobody else is affected by my life choices, but to my kid I\u2019m the example. Remind any good parent their kids are watching - they\u2019ll feel it. Just do so in a meek and child who needs their parents back tone, not make them feel like the kids, that\u2019s when they repel it and start telling you to get in your lane as the child etc. ;-)", "You are an awesome sister. \n\nWhatever your father's wrongdoing, your sisters are innocent. And they are innocent children at that. These so called adults should be ashamed. They are deliberately punishing these children for the behaviour of the parents. \n\nYou made a stand for your sisters and they will remember that. Hopefully your courage has also put an end to this bullshit. I also think it's great that you said it makes you uncomfortable rather than pushing the feelings onto them. NTA.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your mother.", "NTA well done for sticking up for your sisters they now know they can depend on you. as for your mums side of the family they need to grow up and see word can have a bad effect on younger kids. well done again", "NTA. Your father and his AP were horribly wrong to allow your siblings to be under the care of your mother.", "NTA, you did the right thing, your sisters are innocent and do not deserve this treatment.\n\nI do however feel a little sorry for your mom, she obviously doesn't want them there but relented out of obligation, doesn't excuse her actions but I get that she now no longer feels comfortable in her own home because of unwanted extras.\n\nBut don't be surprised if your mom doesn't come back or will only comeback if they leave.\n\nThey might be innocent, but their very existence is a reminder and there is a good chance she'll never be able to do anything but hate them for the \"crime\" of existing.", "NTA, those comments are uncalled for and unkind.\n\nBut INFO: has your sister\u2019s mother passed away? Or did she ask your father to take them because she wasn\u2019t well enough to care for them full time but she is still alive and sees them? Are there any other relatives whom the girls could stay with? Because this situation with your sisters staying in your mothers home when she clearly is not ok with it or not ok with it all the time, that is just going to make things worse unless therapy happens and even then I understand your mother not being ok with having them there. Are your sisters happy to be at your house or would they prefer to be elsewhere that they feel more comfortable? \n\n\nThis situation is horrible for everyone.", "Your mom should\u2019ve left your dad. She\u2019s mean to your sisters because they\u2019re a reminder of his infidelity.", "NTA - You were very brave and mature in addressing a bad situation caused by your parents. Your father is obviously an AH but your mother shouldn\u2019t have agreed to take in these children if she couldn\u2019t treat them with kindness.", "Dad only got involved after his mom stepped in?

Your mom and her relatives however are major As because they're basically bullying innocent children to make up for her husband being unfaithful. The only person deserving of your mom's disdain is your dad.

It would have been easy for her to bully or ignore the two kids, perhaps out of a misplaced need to defend her mother.\n\nGood on her for realising it was cruel and unkind.", "What would you call an abusive bully then? \n\nThese are children. She needs to go see a professional if she is hurt, not take it out on children who are innocent in all this. They didn\u2019t ask to be born or for their mother to get a terminal illness. \n\nThey need love and support after their lives have been ripped apart and they\u2019ve been sent to live with strangers. Not a bunch of adults who should know better making them feel worse by cruel and unnecessary behaviour. OP is the only person in all this that can see how wrong this is. She is a great sibling despite the parents and family around her."]}
