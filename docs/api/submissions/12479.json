Neither they nor you bear a single atom of responsibility for the situation you all find yourselves in.\n\nYour mum is deservedly upset and may never forgive your father but your relatives, all being adults, should have more sense and grace than to verbally abuse and deride children, especially girls. Girls already have a tough time as they are judged on their looks much more harshly than boys ever were, are or will be.\n\nI don't know what your relationship with your sisters is like but they will have seen you stick up for them, on your own and in front of a group of adults, and know you are someone who is their advocate and someone whom they can respect and, perhaps, even love.
