And she's doing it to hurt them on purpose.\n\nShe still fells angry and hurt by what your father did... but instead of taking her anger on him. She's taking on 2 innocent children.\n\nShe's also probably wanting to drive a wedge between you and your sisters. She hopped all those \"compliments\" would make them resent you and you feel superior to them.\n\nShe's being a manipulative asshole.\n\nPlease continue defending your sisters from her abuse. They don't deserve this. They deserve love.", "NTA. You did better than both your parents. You stepped up and defended your sisters because they wouldn't. \n\nYour mom has every right to be upset that your father conceived your sisters with another woman. I can only imagine how she feels having them in your home. *However, they are not the ones who cheated on your mother, and they do not deserve to be treated poorly because of your father's actions.* \n\nYour mom absolutely should not be making such biased and hurtful comparisons between you and your sisters. If she can not treat your sisters with respect, she may need to separate from your dad so that she won't have to live in the same house with your sisters. \n\nYour father seems to have allowed his guilt to get in the way of advocating for your sisters to be treated fairly. It's good that he apologized for not defending your sisters, but he shouldn't have needed your defense of them to prompt him to do the right thing. \n\nYou're a good big sister!", "NTA.\n\nA baby shower may not have been the most ideal place but with the whole family and behaviour issues, something had to be done.  So you told them off rightfully.", "NTA your dad is fully in the wrong here and your mom obviously holds resentment for his infidelity but it is completely wrong of her and any adult who supports her to take that out on innocent children instead of the man who cheated", "NTA. Mum & other relatives are TA for being so shallow and cruel, grandma nailed it. I'm glad your dad finally stepped up because he was being TA too! Hopefully he'll do more to protect ALL his kids in the future!", "NTA, and good job sticking up for your sisters. Sounds like the adults around you need to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYou did everything right.\n\nIt is everyone's else fault for continuing this behavior even after you asked them to stop and shared your reasons.

The adults in your life (with the exception of your grandmother) are behaving horribly. Your dad had an affair, and your mom resents your sisters because they are living, breathing reminders of that affair. Your dad probably isn\u2019t intervening on their behalf because he feels guilty. But regardless of their origins, they are people, and your parents\u2019 actions are probably causing a lot of damage. Good for you for calling them out. Sadly, the only thing you can really do is continue to be their ally and friend. None of what\u2019s going on is your fault. Please don\u2019t blame yourself.", "NTA. The twins had no say in their conception or looks and adults should not be taking it out on the girls in anyway. They did not cause the issue. They are innocents and those who are talking this way are the a h's. You being cognizant of this and defending them is wonderful.", "NTA you did the right thing which is hard sometimes.

You phrased that SO WELL. You handled it perfectly. I'm sorry that your mom was mad, because you did such a good job.\n\n>comparing me and my sisters looks that it made my sisters and I uncomfortable and I rather them not talk about it again especially at events where we're supposed to be celebrating. \n\nThis is all about the behavior (comparing looks) and not the people (the relatives). And about how it makes you *feel* rather than the morality of it. And you even offered a preferred solution.\n\nThis is *textbook* how to approach a conversation like this.\n\n>My dad apologized to my sisters and I for not addressing this issue early due to his own guilt and discomfort.\n\nAnd hopefully, dad will handle it now, like he should have done all along.\n\nI'm not your parent, and I don't even know you, so I have no right to be but... I'm *so* proud of you.\n\nGood job standing up for your sisters.\n\nGood job not taking advantage of your situation.\n\nGood job approaching your dad first.\n\nGood job for approaching the topic maturely.\n\nThis post made my day.

Insulting someone else is not a way to doing a compliment to someone.   \n\n\nalso, everyone is \" a little awkward at asking someone to stop. \". No shame in that. They were rude in the first place. \n\nYour mum is in a very hard place.

NTA. NTA.\n\nYour younger sisters have a warrior on their side in you. Do not apologize. You did the right thing against all odds. I do not think most 17 year olds would have the courage or maturity level to stand up to a room full of their adult relatives behaving as grotesquely as your's were! You're a damn legend. Your mom and anyone else BULLYING CHILDREN owe you an apology. Be proud of yourself. I'm nobody and I'm proud of you!", "okay so, you are NTA, genuinely, kudos for doing the difficult thing and standing up for your innocent younger siblings who did nothing wrong but were possibly being gifted a lifetime of insecurity by these comments. but now, where do i even begin when it comes to the adults in this post\u2026.. your mom is definitely TA, she can be bitter, of course, but the only person she should be taking it out on is your dad. your dad is TA for a multitude of reasons, but specifically here, for not standing up for the two poor children who are in this position because of him. you don\u2019t need to feel horrible for doing the right thing, so please don\u2019t", "NTA\n\nAside from your Grandmother and you, every one of the rest of your relatives, and in particular your Mom were being extremely rude and inappropriate.  It's an awkward situation, but your sisters didn't do anything wrong, whatever happened with your father was not their fault, and it is super rude to talk like that.\n\nSeems like your grandmother is the only one of them who can act like half of an adult.\n\nIf I was one of them I probably would have said something to your mom along the lines of \"apparently your husband thought our mom is better looking than you are or else I wouldn't exist.\"  Now that would piss some people off.", "NTA.  This is a crazy case of the adults acting like children, and the child (you) acting like an adult.\n\nGood for you for standing up for these innocent girls.

But that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t hurt and confused as fuck. She probably feels like her daughter, The one she went through all of this emotional turmoil for loves her half sisters more than her and even if it\u2019s just a figment of her imagination she still has to work through it and come to terms with it all. I wouldn\u2019t call her a huge bitch nor that she is necessarily doing it on purpose but she is certainly messed up and her family enabling the snarky remarks and playing sides really doesn\u2019t help her mental state. I feel if she was a bitch she would have just said no to them moving in.", "You\u2019re 100% right but I\u2019m always torn between blaming the wife, or ,what is usually more common in my real life, Christian bigots who treat divorcing abusers as a sin equal with murder.  Doesn\u2019t apply to OPs mom but I do often wonder how much better the world would be without evangelical Christianity."]}
