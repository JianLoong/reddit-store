{"id": 24168, "submission_id": "15lalpl", "title": "AITA for not letting my sister (40f) move back into my house?", "selftext": "Please help me make the right choice:\n\n6 months ago, my sister (40f) came to live with me (37M), my wife (39f), and 2 girls (under 2). She lost her apartment in a large city, and was staying with our mom (61f), who has the same mental health issues as her. As she had no where else to go and was starting to have a mental health episode herself due to our mother not allowing her to sleep properly I invited her to come and stay in my mother-in-law apartment on our property in a small town. She's normally able to stay stable through healthy eating, schedules, and getting enough sleep every night. Because of our mother's actions not allowing this shorty after staying we were forced to have her placed on a hold as she walked over to a neighbor's house before sunrise and tried to gain access into the house. Since then she's been mostly fine except for one day but was able out of that manic state.\n\nLast week; however, things changed. We started making the real steps for her to move on with getting a job and finding an apartment which was a condition of her moving in. My wife and I have been paying her monthly expenses ($400 about) since she moved in as she had lost her job shortly before arriving.\n\nThis is where it gets worrisome. In her mental state she got into her suv and rammed our closed gate causing somewhere between $12k-$15k damage and totalled her car. In the process she destroyed a sizable portion of an antique, hand-made, cast-iron fence. This was intentional as she lined up her car, validated she would hit the gate evenly, pulled forward, and rammed it in reverse as fast as she could. She also drove through the yard that my toddler was playing in less than 10 minutes before. Without the fence, my goats and dogs are at risk from wandering onto the nearby freeway, so I have to keep them tied up till it's fixed. She's currently in a psychiatric hold. Unfortunately there aren't many many resources for her when she's released, and her options are to come back with my family or go to a homeless shelter as no one else in our family is willing to take her in.\n\nShe refuses all medication, but as stated when she isn't in an actively manic state she can regulate herself. It appears that she put herself into a manic state on purpose by not sleeping, and refusing all sleep aids to not continue next steps of finding a job, and moving out. How can I put my neighbors, my animals, and my family, and my property at risk by bringing her back to the house, but if I don't how do I justify letting my sister be homeless?\n\nAdded context:\nI am holding onto onto almost 2000 dollars that I will pay for her 1/last & security deposit that we earned by painting a house. So all she has to do is get a job, and we will get her into a house/apartment. \n\nAlso her car is totalled so I don't know how to help her with transportation.\n\nNote: wife's age was wrong, updated to correct age.", "created_utc": 1691478707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lalpl/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_40f_move_back_into/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You would also show her, that her dangerous idea worked. You would run a risk that at any point of the future, she does not agree to your rules/conditions she would again endanger not only herself but her surroundings on purpose. \n\nIf she does not want to do the work necessary for her to live an independent and healthy life, it is her decision. And all decisions have consequences. IF she indeed put herself into a manic state by preventing sleep she could've very easily run over one or both of your kids in the process of destroying your gate.  Then it would be too late to lament over it, which can't be fixed by money or undone. Just protect your family and don't enable her.\n\nI think it is generous enough if you don't require her to pay back all those damages and expenses. That would be already helping her honestly.", "NTA you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.

You have your wife and two girls to worry about including your farm animals", "NTA - You can't help someone who doesn't want help.

This isn't your fault.", "You're absolutely NTA. This almost exact situation happened with a family member of mine (except instead of ramming a gate, he wanted to burn the house down).

It doesn't matter that she can regulate herself when she's good, it's that when she can't regulate herself she is a danger to herself and everyone around her. You, your wife, *your daughters*, you are the everyone around her. And, more to the point, you suspect she put herself into a manic state *on purpose*. That means that she *cannot* regulate herself in a *healthy* way, and she therefore cannot be trusted.\n\nI know you love your sister. I know you want to help her. But if she is unwilling to medicate and unable to manage herself? It's not fair to your *family* to risk them again.\n\nYour choice comes down to this: what are you willing to risk? Are you willing to risk your sister having to make her own way? Or are you willing to risk your sister becoming violent *again* and hurting you, your family, a neighbour (an innocent bystander who has no choice)? It's an awful choice to make and it has to be what you can live with, and what you can live without.", "NTA but you would be if you kept her around and your kid got hurt.
