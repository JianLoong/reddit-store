At the very LEAST, MIL should have asked if she could bring ingredients, at which point Dean would have told her why that would not work. \n\nNope, she brought stuff knowing you were allergic to it.

We're not talking about being annoying, it \\*could literally kill you\\* - and possibly weeks or even months after she left!

It's your fault, she's the victim, look how cruel you are... She could have killed you. Make sure everyone knows that, and have hubby search her bags if she is allowed back.

I ask because meat/shelfish/processed meat allergic/intolerant reactions can actually be reactions to histamines.  It's still a new field, so I would guess not.\n\nThey're all things that build up histamines that most people don't notice.  But if your mast cells are fucking up...\n\nThere's actually treatment for MCAS now.  I'm starting treatment as soon as the medication comes off backorder.  My sister has been on it for months, and it has worked wonders for her.\n\nIf your intolerance response is a histamine response, famotidine (pepcid) will help tame the symptoms. \n\nI've had IgE blood tests that say I am allergic to nothing.

Very weird for me", "Didn't you know all you have to do was wash off those pesky allergies and then it's safe? The entire world got food allergies completely wrong this whole time. If you have a food allergy just wash off the allergy spores and you're good to go. Op's Mil taught all of us something new lol. \n\nSeriously wtf. She could've killed you. NTA at all.", "Once other family members get involved, game over. It would be NC for me. You did nothing wrong. NtA", "Probably because she's the type to force people to eat foods they don't like. I'm pretty sure that's where the fake \"allergies\" come from. People get so fed up with people serving them stuff they really don't like while doing the whole \"You haven't had it MY way!\" thing. They get dismissed as \"fussy\" even if it ruins a meal for them. \"Finish your plate\" \"There are starving children in Mesopotamia\". So they start saying they're allergic so people will finally take them seriously. Unfortunately that just turns those people into the type that \"test\" allergies.", "WOW...that is cold.  I am glad you don't see them anymore...and I wouldn't trust ANYTHING coming from her kitchen.  Take care", "Yeah. My mom thinks my allergies are a choice.  \"Rusty doesn't *like* peppers.\"  \"Well, no, Mom. They keep trying to kill me.\"", "Get those keys back or change your locks", "Oohh.   Good idea!   Especially as he definitely has OPs back.", "You don't enter the kitchen from the front door in my area of the US.  I must have looked at over 100 homes before I built mine and found  most of the homes built in the last 25 years in the mid-Atlantic region have the front door enter into a foyer with formal rooms (living room, dining room, library, etc) off to each side.  The back of the house will be a huge area that will be the eat in kitchen, family room, and frequently a large sunroom. The back door might come into the kitchen/sunroom, and the garage door usually comes through a mudroom into the kitchen. Helps when unloading groceries.\n\nBecause the kitchen is so open, there are no doors that separate it from the other rooms.  We thought about a pocket door between the kitchen and formal dining room,  but didn't bother.\n\nYou might be thinking of small apartments/condos where many have a door next to the kitchen. They are not setup at all like houses.", "Well, this is actually true.  The issue is\u2026where the allergic things got to.  Unless you mean the food itself.\n\nIf someone was careful, they could manage.  Most people are not that careful", "NTA for sure, go ask the people who are saying you're rude if theyd prefer you to be dead to rude, because that's exactly what they're suggesting.", "The \u201cyou havent had it my way\u201d has been my entire life most recently from my bfs mom (who genuinely apologized) im autistic and i cannot eat onions in any way or i will throw up (suspected ARFID) she pushed me on the topic while she was cooking until i snuck out of the kitchen and had a meltdown in another room. 10 minutes later my bf found me and it took 30 minutes to calm me down just enough to explain to him. He dealt with it and his moms been great about it since.\n\nThe rest of my family still thinks im just a picky eater who doesn\u2019t want to try new things and tries to trick me into it but I\u2019m extremely cautious around food from them.", "That also really feels like people just being bad hosts."]}
