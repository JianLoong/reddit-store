At the very LEAST, MIL should have asked if she could bring ingredients, at which point Dean would have told her why that would not work. \n\nNope, she brought stuff knowing you were allergic to it. If she really hated your food, she could bring her own dish just like you do when you visit them.  So they are definitely TA for just completely ignoring all the facts and trying to do what they wanted in spite of them.\n\nYou are NTA since MIL has already exhibited that she will try to do what she wants in your kitchen.  We're not talking about being annoying, it \\*could literally kill you\\* - and possibly weeks or even months after she left! Your only choice (aside from hurling her out of your home) was to keep her out of the food prep area.  I, for one, applaud that you let her stay to keep the peace in the family and only locked her out of the kitchen itself.", "NTA. She thinks allergies = fussy... You're not controlling her eating, she's risking your bloody life. Because she doesn't believe you really have them, you're picky, fussy, childish. So her bringing forbidden foods will \"show your husband that he doesn't need to enable your childish behaviour, it's all in your head...\" She is dangerous OP, she will slip some seafood into your cocoa (or something) I know this because as soon as she gets caught she leaps to the DARVO. It's your fault, she's the victim, look how cruel you are... She could have killed you. Make sure everyone knows that, and have hubby search her bags if she is allowed back.  (Hubby is being great so far by the way) Keep safe OP, and keep the kitchen door MIL free.", "NTA. Food allergens are a serious health threat. Your IL's refusal to take yours seriously is beyond unacceptable. I would ban them from your house in the future if continue to try subvert your dietary heath practices.", "NTA. You have people who do not take your allergies seriously and are not only uneducated about food allergies, but refuse to be educated about how they actually work. Because of this, especially in *your own home*, you need to do what you need to do to protect your own health. Your in-laws were *guests in your home*, they were exceptionally rude bringing that food into your home knowing that you are allergic to it. Not only that, but they can go the length of their trip without having red meat, seafood, mushrooms, etc... It really is not that big of a sacrifice.\n\nAs far as their family members calling you - this is your in-laws subcontracting out their bullying of you to others because they failed to do so when they visited. If it were them just leaving in a snit, it might could be put down to them being ignorant or misunderstanding. But the fact that they went out and got their family members to call you and harass you means that they knew what they were doing in order to harass you and, when that failed, they found another way to do it, hiding it behind \"controlling her eating.\"", "NTA - Put those family members on mute and don\u2019t allow your in-laws to stay again. They don\u2019t respect your allergies that are life threatening and won\u2019t. \n\nYour husband should be blasting them back about how his mother was trying to kill you or make you end up in the hospital on Thanksgiving because it could literally be framed that way. She has been informed multiple times about the severity of your allergies.\n\nThis is literally protecting your health and safety.", "NTA.  Your MIL/FIL are ignorant about allergies, trying to put you in the hospital (don't discount this, I know two people personally that this happened to), or a little of both.", "NTA, tell her you weren\u2019t controlling her eating, you were controlling her chances of killing you with her carelessness. If she didn\u2019t like being locked out, she should put some thought into the food she brings into someone else\u2019s home.", "NTA. I live in a household with food allergies. It took half a decade to convince some family members that it was \u201creal\u201d and another half decade for them to adjust kitchen etiquette for needed safety. Your MIL is currently dangerous.", "NTA, this level of blatant disregard for allergies, especially ones that cause anaphylaxis, is negligent at best, attempted murder-y at worst. Definitely keep your kitchen locked constantly, and take their house key for good measure.", "\"she believed washing the surfaces is enough to get rid of the allergen\"\n\nThis is why education on allergies is important for everyone!\n\nNTA.", "NTA, what a crazy woman.  I guess she wont be enjoying your company or presence at her table ever again and only in restaurants in the future.  You can have a little fun throwing any food she sends to your house right into the trash, hopefully in front of her.  If it were me, she would not be invited back unless she had somewhere else to stay.  She would not have much time, if any, with grandkids if she was willing to poison you, what might she do to one of your kids?  Good luck!", "You are not the asshole here at all. You and I have overlap in allergies.\n\nI have so many allergies that my medic alert bracelet is a QR code.  (Lifeid)\n\nIf allergies kill me, red bell pepper is going to be the culprit.\n\nHave you ever been checked for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome? I ask because meat/shelfish/processed meat allergic/intolerant reactions can actually be reactions to histamines.  It's still a new field, so I would guess not.\n\nThey're all things that build up histamines that most people don't notice.  But if your mast cells are fucking up...\n\nThere's actually treatment for MCAS now.  I'm starting treatment as soon as the medication comes off backorder.  My sister has been on it for months, and it has worked wonders for her.\n\nIf your intolerance response is a histamine response, famotidine (pepcid) will help tame the symptoms. \n\nI've had IgE blood tests that say I am allergic to nothing.  But skin prick tests show I am allergic to a lot.", "F\u2019em! Your kitchen and house, your rules.", "NTA and how childish is your MIL that she went whining to her relatives and has them contacting you about this.", "INFO\n\nIf Dean removed and returned all the allergens, why did you need to lock them out of the kitchen? Were they brining in additional food? How would they access food if you were out?", "There is an ahole in this story but it\u2019s not you \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWhat about the fact that food allergies can literally kill you in under ten minutes are your in-laws not understanding?  Maybe I just have more exposure to extreme food allergic people than they do.  But seriously what were they thinking???!!!", "NTA. If she wanted red meat she could go eat some, not cook it in your home", " NTA MIL is totally misrepresenting what happened", "NTA You are trying to protect yourself.

I don\u2019t eat anything with gluten at my sister\u2019s house as she has celiac.
