I just sat there watching him ramble and letting him embarrass himself for a couple of minutes. Had a lot of practice letting him embarrass himself in front of others. Eventually my son said \u2018Why do I have such a stupid uncle?\u201d\n\nI laughed. I confess I laughed out loud before telling my brother it\u2019s time for him to leave. Later on our mom called me and said I should have made my son apologize. I told her that my brother has the right to say what he wants but my son also has the right to say what he thinks, especially after my brother tried to turn him against our family cat. My mom hung up the phone in a huff.\n\nDo you think I should have made my son call and apologize to my brother, just to appease my mom?\n\nEDIT : In case anyone worried, I will not be allowing my brother into my house ever again.
