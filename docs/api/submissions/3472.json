And what your parents choose to do in terms of financial gifts to you and your family has nothing to do with them. At the end of the day, your sister in law is just asking you to give your daughter\u2019s money to her daughter. Which is wildly inappropriate no matter where it came from. Your daughter\u2019s money \u2014 and this is all about gifts made to your daughter, a minor, and you and your husband are responsible for stewarding her money as responsible parents \u2014 is hers to do what she wants with when she is of age to access it. Stop viewing this request as having anything to do with your parents and start asking Candace why she thinks she has a right to steal from your child to give to hers? Does she think her daughter has a right to gifts given to other children? That her daughter can go take a shirt she wants off another kid? Or a toy she wants but her parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t buy? The college fund conversation she can try to have with your brother and your parents if parity of gift giving is a hill she wants to die on. But the Isla\u2019s Money conversation is a totally different one.  It\u2019s not about bad faith, it\u2019s about stealing from someone who was given a gift that requires protection until they are old enough to make their own decisions.", ">Ben cares a lot about Kaylee, but Candace takes care of Kaylee financially, and makes all the decisions about parenting, which is the arrangement they've agreed on and no one questions that.\n\nPretty much one of the important parts that makes Candace the asshole here.\n\n>Candace recently found out about the college fund, and is livid. She thinks my parents owe Kaylee a college fund because 'she is their granddaughter too'. Now, for better or worse, my parents don't see it that way. Apparently Candace called my parents about this, and asked Ben to put pressure on them to provide money for Kaylee, but they wouldn't budge.\n\nCandace is \"double dipping\" and it's entirely an asshole move here. Admittedly I don't know much about what her ex's role is in her daughters life and how much he contributes if anything, but it's irrelevant because she herself asserted financial dominion over her daughters upbringing and she herself chose that path independently. She cannot then turn around and demand payouts from her husbands family.\n\n>I said all this to Candace, and she hasn't contacted me since. However, some relatives have said since I wouldn't miss the money, I should think about contributing at least some of the money to Kaylee's education.\n\nIrrelevant, and it's always an asshole move for people to count your dollars and morally volunteer them.
