Stop viewing this request as having anything to do with your parents and start asking Candace why she thinks she has a right to steal from your child to give to hers? Does she think her daughter has a right to gifts given to other children? That her daughter can go take a shirt she wants off another kid? Or a toy she wants but her parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t buy?

The only one who should be able to do anything with this fund is ISLA. \n\n>some relatives have said since I wouldn't miss the money, I should think about contributing at least some of the money to Kaylee's education.\n\nTell them that since they have decided that it concerns them so much that they can have an opinion on how and what you do that they should start saving up now so THEY can contribute!", "NTA\n\nHOW did Candace find out about this??  Your daughter's educational fund has NOTHING to do with Candace OR Kaylee.\n\nWhy isn't your brother putting money away for his stepdaughter?  Or is he also of the opinion that Kaylee 'isn't related'?   \n\nIf Candace opens a 539 for Kaylee, anyone can give gifts to support Kaylee's education.   Instead of a doll for Christmas, they can put 25 in her 529 account.\n\nYou may not have been the most diplomatic in the way that you spoke to Candace, but the fact remains - Kaylee is NOT entitled to your daughter's fund.", "NTA. Candace doesn\u2019t even have her husband contribute financially for her daughter but all of a sudden expects you and your parents to? No. It doesn\u2019t work that way. And the kids are too young to say that one kid needs it more than the other.", "NTA\n\nParents money, their choice. They do not see K as their grandchild. Their priviledge.\n\nBen is not really the father of K since her mother takes.all parental rights for herself and provides for K financially.\n\nC has no rights in this situation.", "NTA.  I can totally see why nobody likes Candace. It takes real nerve to call up people and DEMAND money.  Yikes.  There is absolutely NO way I would entertain this.  She needs to be shot down hard.  Her calling around and demanding money from the family is completely unacceptable.  Your parents have set aside the money for your child and it is hers and hers alone - to do anything else with it would be wildly disrespectful and perhaps criminal.", "wtf she is not his granddaughter I do not understand these people who expect to be considered family when they are outsiders and they do not have an emotional connection NTA", "NTA\n\nKaylee isn't blood of your blood and apparently your parents aren't really fond of her or her mom anyway, i don't see why theys hould give money to this little girl. Furthermore,  Candance should have started saving for her own daughter, and as she found out about the trust fund, she should have started saving herself. If your brother wants to help towards her education he should, but with his money.", "NTA Kaylee has two sets of grandparents who can save for her, she also has 2 fathers and one mother. Thats it. The ex might not be in their life but the court can go over child support. Also she isnt entitled to gifts - its literally her and her new husband your brothers duty to save for her. Why are they flipping out they have years.\n\nAlso HAS  YOUR BROTHER ADOPTED KAYLEE?", "Why does she reek of entitlement here. NTA and don\u2019t back down. Respect your parents wishes and do not give in to her. She is a piece of work.", "NTA technically it is your daughters and any leftover will go to her daughters or sons. That is what I told my kids. So use it wisely It can be a gift the keep going.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt sounds like Candace has kept her daughter separate from the family as did the actual geographical mileage. Relationships more than anything make a family IMOA, blood is second. If the child was sleeping over every weekend with the Grandparents and they TREATED her like a grandchild, then yes, they should donate to her education if they donate to your child's education. Regardless of DNA.   \n\n\nIt WOULD be wrong to redistribute your parents money against their wishes.   \n\n\nWhat money you would, or would not miss, is not an issue AT ALL. People suggesting that are free to contribute to this child's education.", "NTA. Your parents their rule.  Tell those relatives that are reaching out and are so concerned that they are more than welcome to start a college fund for Kaylee.  Problem solved.", "All of this gives me the ick.\n\nPeople demanding money, especially money they're not entitled to, is just gross. Why do people think they are so entitled.\n\nI have two stepkids with no biokids of my own. My brother has two kids, my parents only bio grandkids. I do not expect them to treat my SK's the exact same as their bio grandchildren. I do expect them to treat them with respect and not isolate them from my niblings, and they don't. At Christmas, all 4 kids get the exact same presents, etc. but if my parents want to set up an education fund for my niblings and not my SK's, I would not be upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n  \n\"My parents aren't fond of Candace. Of course they're polite, and they're happy Ben is happy, but no one has really warmed to her. ***It's not for any particular reason***, there just hasn't been a click on either side of the equation, Candace is not too fond of us all either.\"  \n\n\nOh, there is a reason. Her behavior in this situation is an example of the reason.", "Ouch this one is tough. It's not \"fair\" but no one is required to give money to someone if they don't want to, so I agree you are NTA even though if I were Candace/Ben/Kaylee I would feel insulted and I think, to a degree, rightly so.\n\nI think it's sad that so many people cannot see non-blood relatives as equal family, but still you cannot demand something of someone like this.", "NTA. Tell Candace it\u2019s not your money to be doling out, your parents are setting it aside for their grandchild. Just say you have to stay out of it bc it\u2019s not your business. It\u2019s between your child and her grandparents. \n\nAlso to add, this is insane! I asked my husband to ask his mom for therapy money for our Xmas gifts and he refuses, feeling like that\u2019s asking for a handout. For Candice, who has an icy rs with her in-laws, to ask them for college money, which can total into the $10s, if not $100s, of thousands, WOW. A LOT OF NERVE. \n\nNTA", "Regardless of the family relations or perceived \"fairness\", why do people allways want to get generous with other people's money?\n\nNTA", "NTA I can see why nobody likes Candace.", "Blood doesn't make a family.", "I don\u2019t know Candace and I don\u2019t care for her either. NTA based simply on you don\u2019t tell other people you\u2019re entitled to their money. And you don\u2019t pressure family to go against each other over money.", "Why does your brother not contribute to financially caring for his stepdaughter but finds it acceptable to put pressure on your parents and you to?\n\nSince Candace is comfortable accepting money for her daughter, makes a lot more sense for her husband to start a college fund he contributes to each month.\n\nAt the very least, you never should have been wrangled into a conversation that doesn't involve you. The other relatives are a bit nuts to expect you to commit to financing anything 11 years from now. Who knows if you will still be as financially stable, if the daughter wants to go to college, or if they will still be married. NTA", "Candace told things that you can't proof.\n\nCould it be that Candace was \"nice\" to them too and is cut off?!?\n\nKaylee is 7 and until then your parents could have change their mind.\nWith Candaces demands there will be no change for sure", "He hasnt adopted her, so he isnt her father and your parents are not her  grandparents.", "I think it depends on the relationship.  In this situation the brother is clearly not acting as her dad, he's being a step dad.  If he had adopted his step child or was an active parent in her life I might have a bit more sympathy.", "Err, there's 10 years, it's not a straight 102828/(10*12) calculation. Over that time period the money needs to be invested  in a reasonably stable fund and compound interest leveraged to maximise the amount. The regular repayments with an annual 5% return is more like $662.50. Still a lot but not quite as bad as $856.", "And if she's so set on being the only one allowed to parent/fund Kaylee then why isn't she also taking responsibility for her college education? Candace needs to call all the shots about Kaylee until Isla get a windfall and suddenly Candace is in desperate need of financial help? I don't think so. NTA", "I agree - I know for a fact that my parents would say the same thing; no matter how many children I adopted, if my sister had a biological child, that would be their first grandchild.  And I think it's reasonable to believe that.  My mother gave birth to my sister, and she would watch my sister do the same thing.  It's a different situation altogether.  It might hurt my feelings, but I would completely understand.", "The girl is 7, that\u2019s more than enough time for Candice to save a college fund.", "Inlays?", "Being treated differently from your biological counterparts is effectively a punishment and the proof is in the pudding - kids aren't stupid, they can tell when they are treated differently, and this is a very big difference in treatment. As I said in my first comment, no one is *required* to give money, but this choice will have relationship repercussions.", "You have their answer - she's not."]}
