How can he expect you to make a fuss if him if he isn't willing to do the same? While I do understand making a mistake with budgeting, it sounds like he made no effort to make up for it (even taking you to a slightly cheaper place or offering to make you a romantic meal).\n\nI've seen a lot of similar posts, but where the woman is asking for expensive gifts, but it sounds like you're happy with whatever can be spared and that you just want the thought to be there (you mentioned a handwritten note).

I told him Father's Day, I will still put the effort in because it isn't about me, it is from our son to him but if I got no effort the following year, I would not. He stepped up his game and had a lovely day. The difference here is, he was so guilty he hadn't bought me a card or anything, not planned anything, etc. He tried so hard during the day to make up for it.

Your family should have left him home and celebrated the day with you.", "NTA. He asked for it. If things went down on Mother\u2019s Day the way you describe, I don\u2019t understand how he could with a straight face ask you about plans for his bday and Father\u2019s Day. Not the same kind of scenarios, but I remember my ex feeling (or at least acting like he felt) 100% justified doing things that were ridiculously unfair and borderline offensive in our marriage.

If the relationship is important to you, I don\u2019t think you should make a habit of retaliation. That being said, your response feels more than justified. I\u2019d have to say NTA.\n\nI think this is something that you need to talk over with him. It seems reasonable that if he feels this way about you \u2018ignoring\u2019 his special day, then he should be able to understand why it bothers you when he does the same.", "Okay, I'm also going to say NTA, but imma give you a different take here...\n\nSome people care about birthdays, holidays and \"special occasions.\"\n\nSome people don't. \n\nTo some people, it's just another day, and the commercialism, expectations and pressure are off putting - for example, my fiance and I celebrate each other's birthdays, but we don't \"do,\" valentine's day.\n\nIt sounds to me like there's a disconnect between how you each view these \"special days-\" for you, they've a big deal, for him, it's Not A Thing.\n\nIf you haven't already, you might want to make your expectations and desires clear ( and money shouldn't be an issue! Handmade stuff, chores done, and handpicked flowers etc are wonderful!!) \n\nBut, if this just isn't something he cares about, then, well, is it worth the relationship? Or is the relationship, family and kids worth more?\n\nI'd say that, if everything else is good between you two, then you should probably adjust your expectations around holidays. But if this is part of a larger pattern and is just \"the straw that broke the camel's back,\" then you may have to think deeper.\n\nEither way, it's unfair for him to expect from you, effort that he was unwilling to give TO you.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband is a selfish AH and it is resulting in this toxic atmosphere that your children especially do not deserve to be exposed to.

Do you think it's fair to expect them to witness your arguments and exist under a cloud of resentment?\n\nThink carefully.", "Why would you do ANYTHING for this guy, he clearly doesnt care for you but wants you to do something for him in return.

NTA but seriously girl, stop putting up with this. You can do soo much better. You deserve better than that. You deserve someone like your dad, someone who you can spoil because he will spoil you back. You are worth more. \n\nBeing alone is better than being with someone who makes you feel less.

What are you getting out of this relationship? You sound like a single parent. You are the only one putting effort in this relationship and even your parents are worried about you. It\u2019s sound like you have a good support system. I don\u2019t think your husband is part of that. I would seriously reconsider this relationship.", "ESH. I think the problem is that you both have very different love languages. I say ESH really as, this is just a shit situation.\n\nSee my love language is physical touch. Your seems to be receiving gifts. It\u2019s very important to you, and you feel unloved.\n\nNow any normal person would be frustrated with this, at the least. But if someone was treating holidays like that but yet completely fulfilling my love language (physical touch) I wouldn\u2019t feel unloved, I would just feel under appreciated a bit. \n\nI think maybe you need to figure out his love language, if you don\u2019t know. Cause obviously his is not gift giving.\n\nSay he\u2019s is physical touch, and you are fulfilling his physical needs. Or whatever his language is.\n\nHe may feel like the relationship is doing great if his love language is being fulfilled. I think you need to figure out his love language, and put a hold on that. Deprive him of his love language. And when he states he doesn\u2019t feel loved, tell him your love language is gift giving and you haven\u2019t been fulfilled  due to his lack of acknowledging your need for gifts.\n\nSeparate love languages is an extremely common deal\nBreaker.\n\nSince his love language isn\u2019t gift giving, you threatening to not gift him things in return, comes off as petty or spiteful from his point of view. It\u2019s mot his language.\n\nYou need to speak his language and deprive him of it. He needs to taste the same pain.\n\nNow this is under the circumstance you want to save this marriage. If you decide in your head he\u2019s not worth that, then just walk away.\n\nHow much you love someone is not congruent with how long a relationship or marriage lasts. \n\nYou can love someone with all your soul, but not be happy with them because a miscommunication of love languages.\n\nNow let\u2019s say he also is selfish, rude, and doesn\u2019t listen to you thoroughly. Than you might be with a narcissist. With this there is know way out.\n\nAsk him his love language though if you don\u2019t know what it is, and deprive it. If after that, he does not change than you are married to a man who in unwilling to put the work in to have a partner. If he can\u2019t see your side after experiencing it himself, than he is just selfish.\n\nSo you have to choose, do you want to be with a selfish lover that is comfortable with his love language being met while yours suffers? If the answer to that is no, than you know the right choice.\n\nYou have to communicate clearly. Use the words love language specifically, ask him if he fully understands what a love language is.\n\nHe may assume he does know what it is, but may not fully. Some people assume what words mean, and can\u2019t apply it because they don\u2019t actually understand what is being spoken about.\n\nHe may really need to experience his own love language suffering to understand what you are feeling.\n\nHe may be incapable of communicating properly and it will be impossible for you to communicate to him successfully that their is a lack of love language being met. \n\nNot everyone in this world is emotionally intelligent. They\u2019re are people in this world unable to comprehend actually how much you are suffering from their actions.\n\nIt could be due to autism, it could be because he was raised that\u2019s way. None the less, an inability to fully comprehend the needs of another, is not functional for marriage. It will inevitably grow to the point that you hate each other. Hate each other because you can\u2019t see eye to eye on what\u2019s important.\n\nYou may fucking love each other to death, but inability to communicate is a silent killer with marriage or any partnership.\n\nIf the ability to communicate effectively is not there, than both sides will ultimately feel unloved.\n\nBut imo the best way to get that communication across is by depriving him of his Iove language. Let him feel the pain. \n\nAnd when he comes to feeling unloved wondering why you are not fulfilling his love language, than you tell him this is how I feel without you being there for me on holidays.\n\nIf he can\u2019t grasp it, than realize this not gonna work. No matter how much you love someone, if they are unable to digest and comprehend how their lack of catering to your love language is causing resentment, the face the hard truth that you too are not right for each other.", "NTA but please leave, I'm betting you do all the chores/childcare etc.  You sound like you have lovely parents who will support you, because you're definitely not getting it from him.\n\nAlso remember you're modelling relationships for your kids and what is acceptable.", "NTA when it comes right down to it, it's clear that your husband doesn't value you or the family.

He blames your financial situation, but how many times have you had to get something expensive for his birthday or he's gone and gotten himself something despite not having the money for it? \n\nThis is a man who doesn't care about you or value you, if he did he would acknowledge that you want certain things for holidays and would do his best to accomodate. You accomodate him on his holidays, hell he just has the gall to ask what he's going to get for his birthday because like a child he got jealous of the things your parents did for you, HIS wife and mother of his children, on Mother's Day.

Also, look at his actions during the time they were at her parents.

My God the self-absorption of this man can be seen from space.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is an absolute d!ck and only cares about himself.", "He could come around and be a decent husband, but not if you don\u2019t give him a wake up call.\n\n#Start matching his energy.\n\nPlan your life as if he\u2019s a room mate, and start separating your finances or at least managing the family budget day-to-day.\n\nGo out and do things you enjoy.  Live your life as if you don\u2019t expect anything from him and don\u2019t give him any more than he gives you.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed is that suddenly when someone isn\u2019t available and panting after them, suddenly the person starts to respect them again.  \n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t shake him up, it will bring more joy to your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Although I'm certainly paying for it in other ways. Anyway don't be me. Don't continue putting up with it.

NTA but you definitely married one.", "NTA - yes, his family can't do it for him but he relied on your family to make you feel special. He has feet, hands, and a voice. If he can't do something for you, why expect you to do something for him? I'd maybe give him a pass if he didn't do something and also didn't expect something - not everyone does b'days or gets them.

What legends! \n\nLeave him.", "Definitely NTA here \n\nOne thing I am confused about though (I'm not American - not just about this post but in general) is how come spouses are expected to do stuff on mother's Day. I get it if the kid is really young and unable to do it themselves, but once I reached early teens my dad just focused on his mum and gave me the money to pick out a gift and a card. Same with fathers day. Could someone explain it please?

You know, when you do things over and over again, expecting a different outcome? That's what this is.\n\nYou have 2 choices, obviously - leave or stay.

I doubt this one thing is the *only* bad thing in this relationship.", "Honey. It seems like you have an awesome mom and dad who love and care about you a lot. I would move myself and my child in with them and get rid of the selfish husband. He will only give you more heartbreak and no gifts.

Tell him that he's hurting you when he forgets an event. It may not be important to him, that's why he assumes it's not important to you?

I think it's pretty callous to not celebrate you on your day, or any day really, and expect something special on \"his days.\" Him not helping you feed your child on Mother's Day, while you're pregnant, is telling.

She may not have had much says the second pregnancy.", "It's better than staying in a marriage where she has to beg her husband to act like he cares about her.

As it stands, this guy is acting like a deadbeat dad and husband. He knows this but doesn't care enough to do anything about it.\n\nStaying in this relationship is going to teach their children that daddy's behaviour is ok.\n\nDivorce or marriage counselling are the only real options here. It's OPs decision about which she thinks is best.", "I guarantee I would have been better if my parents had divorced. And I'm in my late 40s now but seriously we all knew they were very unhappy and it transferred to us in many ways. Staying together is not necessarily the right answer.
