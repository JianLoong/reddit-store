{"id": 14050, "submission_id": "12cbhzu", "title": "AITA for telling my stepfather he's a controlling asshole when he said I can't take my sister out for \"fast food\" anymore?", "selftext": "I (27f) have a little sister (half-sister 13f). I moved out about 4 years ago and ever since then I've been taking her out about once a week to hang out and get food; usually sushi, Chinese food or Subway (my sister's favourite). This is our bonding time. We both love food and getting out of my parent's house gives her the opportunity to vent about what's going on at home or just relax and watch youtube videos and browse memes on Reddit. She's told me how much she appreciates it and I often get text messages from her asking to go out when I've missed several weeks in a row.  \n\n\nMy step-father (M53) hates when I take my sister out. He's been in my life since I was 2 and he started making my life hell when my half-brother (M18) was born. I could write a whole novel about the things he did but the relevant issue here is he caused me to have an incredibly unhealthy relationship with food. When I moved out at 22 I was just shy of 300 pounds and had absolutely no skills when it came to regulating my eating/habits. In the past few years, I've done a lot of work, I've been seeing a professional and I've managed to get my weight down to 230 which I consider a huge step in the right direction.   \n\n\nMy sister is an athlete, and I don't say that lightly. She's in the highest level league for her sport of choice and if everything goes well she'll probably have a full-ride scholarship when she does eventually go off to university. As a result, my step-father has gotten obsessive about what kind of food they keep at home. My sister often complains to me about how stifling it is and she's even expressed to me things that make me worry she might start developing an eating disorder. I've told all of this to my mother but she's a bit of a wet blanket sometimes when it comes to my step-father.   \n\n\nWell, I brought her home the other day from one of our outings and I get a text from my step-father. He basically said I'm not allowed to take my sister out for \"fast food\" anymore as I'm messing up her sports and he doesn't want her to get fat like me.    \nI BLEW up at him, Told him he was a piece of shit and a complete asshole. I laid out all the things he did in my childhood that caused me to be overweight and have an unhealthy relationship with food and said if it wasn't for me my sister would probably already have an eating disorder with how controlling and obsessive he is about food.   \n\n\nHe told the whole family that I was disrespectful to him and now everyone is divided. Part of my mom's side of the family (who knows how my stepdad can be) is proud of me for standing up for myself and telling him the truth. The rest of the family is on my stepdad's side, saying I'm disrespectful and that he's just doing what's best for my sister. He's demanding an apology and while there's no way in hell I'm doing that. I'm wondering if I went too far in telling him what I thought.   \n\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680677961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cbhzu/aita_for_telling_my_stepfather_hes_a_controlling/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say that as someone with restrictive eating disorders.\n\nGiven your sister has expressed to you that she\u2019s worried she\u2019s going to develop an eating disorder\u2026the fact that your mother isn\u2019t really doing anything about that disgusts me. Eating disorders kill so many of us, and that\u2019s a harsh reality. \n\nAlso, you should be incredibly proud of the work you\u2019ve put into your body in terms of your relationship with food. It sounds like you\u2019re doing amazingly.", "NTA, but you're out from under his control but your sister isn't, so you have to think about how this fight affects her. He might make things harder for her, or prevent your contact with her.", "NTA, it seems like AH parents like to throw the term disrespectful after being called out for something they know they\u2019re clearly in the wrong but not going to admit it.", "NTA - First of all, you are spending time with your sister in a way you both enjoy. Proving that outlet for her is good and let\u2019s her know you are someone she can trust. \n\nSecond, it sounds like your sister is enjoying the food you get together. This is important to consider because if you were forcing her to eat food she didn\u2019t like that would be completely different. You are also proving an outlet for her to eat \u201cnot allowed\u201d foods in a non-judgemental environment and allowing her to make her own decisions. Both of these are going to help her long term because unhealthy relationships with food are very easy to develop, especially at her age. \n\nWhile I understand concerns about athletic performance and the importance of scholarships for college, it is very easy for parental figures to overlook the child in front of them when planning for the future. If you\u2019re super concerned about your bonding time and dinners affecting her performance, you could consider touching base with her school or coaches (if she has any) and get their observations on the matter. It\u2019s likely that what they see is going to have a lot less emotional baggage attached and they can be a good outside perspective. \n\nOP, the only thing I would query would be what you mean by you \u201cblew up\u201d at your step father. How you deliver a reality check may be rude, but overall your actions are based out of compassion for your sister with no foreseeable downsides and that means no asshole-ery has occurred", "Definitely NTA.\n\nWhat you eat doesn't matter anywhere near as much as what you do. You said she is an athlete, maybe show your stepfather what Usain bolt ate during the Olympics when he did the world record - McDonalds chicken nuggets, 1000 of them in 10 days.\n\nAt her age it really doesn't matter what she eats as long as she maintains exercise. Metabolism will take care of the rest.\n\nBy the way great job overcoming your stepfather's abuse when it comes to food. That is not easy to do.", "No. NTA. You didn\u2019t go far enough IMO. You need to lay into your mom too. She allowed this to happen. Tell her as you told your stepfather. That she did nothing when his abuse resulted in your relationship with food caused you to gain weight and here she is again letting the cycle repeat itself with his hypercritical fixation on little sisters diet to do then same except potentially have her have an aversion to food and an ED. Your mom failed you more than he did.", "NTA\n\nWhere is your mother in all this? Hon, why are YOU at 27 having to duke it out with a man in his 50s to protect your sister? \n\nStepfather did a horrible job on you since you were 9yo, and now he's doing a slightly different horrible job on his bio daughter. He's got massive control issues around food. And she's stuck in that household for at least 5 more years...\n\nTell your mother to get stepfather off your case or you will tell EVERYONE in specific detail what it was like to share a household with the Chief of Food Police. And what it did to you. \n\nAlso, tell your sister that from now on, what you two get up to on your outings is none of her dad's business. Like, she needs to become a master of Grey Rock. If she blabs to him about what you two do or eat, those outings will be taken away.\n\nI think your idea of talking to the head coach is very good, but it should be *your mother* and you in that interview. It is way past time for your mother to step up and protect at least ONE of her daughters. \n\nGood for you for standing up to him, OP, it was a long time coming!!", "First of all congratulations on making amazing steps forward for your health. \n\nAbsolutely NTA and your stepfather should be ashamed of himself (highly unlikely). All you can do is continue to be a fantastic big sis!", "NTA and you\u2019re correct about the ED and your sister. She could start hoarding food or binge when not around him.

You may want to consider the fake apology strategy because if you don't then your sister is the one who suffers.\n\nSushi sounds like a healthy option, maybe stick to that in future.", "Thank you very much. I'm really trying to get better.   \nRight now I'm more worried about my sister though.", "Thank you for the kind words. I might try and reach out to the head coach of her team, unfortunately, my stepfather is the assistant coach so that might be difficult.   \nI had to leave out the specifics for the word count. In terms of blowing up, I turned around and went back to his house and basically yelled at him for a good half an hour. I unloaded everything I'd been holding back for years and pointed out in detail everything he did and has been doing with some very colourful language. I only left because the yelling was upsetting my sister so much that she asked me to leave.", "Honestly, it sounds like you're doing amazingly in terms of trying to get better yourself.\n\nYour worries make so much sense. It sounds like your stepfather's behaviour could be absolutely fucking detrimental for your sister.\n\nI do think you have to tread carefully to try to make sure that he doesn't try to limit your contact. I would perhaps suggest that your mum goes and speaks to an eating disorder specialist about the damage that your stepfather could realistically be causing. I also think she should be present if you can speak to the coach, but given your comment about how your stepfather is the assistant coach there could be a lot of toxicity there. Not all coaches look out for the wellbeing of those they're training.\n\nThis is a really, really difficult situation. I did just read your comment that included, \"I only left because the yelling was upsetting my sister so much that she asked me to leave.\" I would be very careful with this in the future. The last thing you want is to offer anything that could enable your stepfather to paint you in a negative light towards your sister, or for her to witness fights that go on like this.", "You\u2019re right to be concerned, the prevalence of disordered eating amongst serious athletes, both boys and girls is\u2026.uncomfortably high. Especially the more elite levels you reach the worse the risk. Your sister sounds very aware of this though so why don\u2019t you both do some more research on disordered eating in athletes so you can both look out for warning signs? Healthy self awareness can\u2019t prevent everything but it can help flag things early before they become full blown disorders.", "NTA.  First, a 70lb weigh loss is huge!  Congrats on getting healthier.  Second, continue taking your sister out and lie about the food.  Let her take home a half empty salad container each time while you go out to eat whatever she wants.  SD is very controlling and I think your doing the right thing by your sis.", "NTA! NTA! NTA!\n\nYes, he is a controlling asshole. Monsters like him don't deserve kids.", "NTA. And wow congrats on your progress!!! It sounds like you\u2019ve done a lot of work mentally and physically. There\u2019s some great advice here so I just wanted to tell you you\u2019re doing amazing :)", "Nta and dont stop taking her and don't apologize.", "nta", "NTA. Keep your sister safe or she will get an eating disorder. Can\u2019t she live with you?"]}
