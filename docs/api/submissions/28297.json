{"id": 28297, "submission_id": "170gr0h", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay my parents rent until my sister does?", "selftext": "Hello reddit\n\nA bit of backstory, I have lived out of home for 2.5 years. Recently, I\u2019ve moved back in with my parents while I finish my degree. I have a sister who is just under 2 years younger than myself, makes about 10% more than I do, does not study, has her bf over 3-4 nights a week, and also has the largest room in the house with a walk in wardrobe and ensuite bathroom. I on the other hand have the smallest room in the house, just bought a wardrobe to store my things, and am a full time student but works office hours 4 days a week. My mum recently came and asked that I contribute to the rent which I was more than happy to help out with. When I asked my sister about this though I found that she doesn\u2019t pay anything, nor does my mum expect her to. I\u2019m not sure if it is because I\u2019m the oldest child so she treats me differently to my brother and sister (brother is younger so is out of the equation re paying). When I confronted my mum about this she just said that I am old enough to contribute to the household, so I said that I refuse to pay anything until my sister does. AITA?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: for clarity I am 21 (22 in January) my sister is 19 (20 this month) and my brother is 17\n\nEdit: I chose to move out due to living pretty far away from my University but the rental market in Australia right now is pretty bleak. My sister also chose to drop out of university and instead pick up a full time job (she doesn\u2019t plan on going in the future either). My family isn\u2019t struggling by any means and it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t contribute at all, I buy groceries and do my share of the cleaning. My mum won\u2019t kick me out if I don\u2019t pay either it just may strain our relationship.", "created_utc": 1696509022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170gr0h/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_parents_rent_until_my/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quite possibly your parents thought that after you'd left the home to get your degree, you wouldn't be back with them, and so now that you are they want rent, whereas your sister seemingly has not yet taken that leap. They may have the idea that you're an adult and your sister isn't yet, and may have positive intentions of holding her to the same standard by the time she is your age or near to it. \n\nAlso, regardless of the double standard, it's not ok for you to 'refuse'. They would be fully entitled to kick you out at this point, and it seems like you are most likely reliant on them or at least benefiting from being under their roof. If they really intend to be harder on you than your siblings indefinitely, then they are approaching A H territory but that's not obviously the situation here.\n\nSo YTA.", "NTA.\n\nWhat they are doing is not logical or fair. You are both their children, both adults living in their house, both have jobs, incomes, and some ability to contribute.\n\nBut they have the power, so they may end up kicking you out and that will be a consequence you may have to accept. In the meantime, maybe you should begin to treat your parents with disparity to show you have learned from their example.", "Soft YTA. It's your mother's house, and if she has asked for rent in exchange for you living there, then you need to comply or move out.\n\nThat said, I agree with you about your sister. If you, a student with a part-time job can contribute to the household, then your sister, who has a full-time job and is not in school, can also contribute. She has graduated to full-time adulting, while you are still in school. Is she saving up to pay for college or something else important, and that's why your mother doesn't want to charge her?\n\nThe reason I'm not calling your mother TA is because my guess is that in her mind, you are 21 and more of an adult, while your sister is a teenager. She probably is viewing your younger sister as still dependent, while viewing you as an adult, and an adult who just moved back in. I don't agree with her assessment on who should pay and who should not, but I don't think that makes her an AH.", "NTA. Your sister is old enough to start contributing as well.", "NTA. You don\u2019t say if you paid rent at home before you moved out 2.5 years ago, but if she\u2019s now going to expect one adult kid to pay rent then all adult kids should pay rent. In my experience, in the US, parents don\u2019t usually expect rent from adult kids going to school, but do if the kid is working. I\u2019m not usually one to say rent should be based on circumstances ,but your sister has the means and should pay. If she is getting the biggest room she should pay more.", "I would say YTA \n\nYou moved out and moved back in. Your sister didnt. Pay rent or leave", "YTA. You're 21, sister is 19. They'll likely ask her to pay rent as well when she's 21 as they mentioned your age when asking you to pay.", "nta, lmao at all the wanna be landlords in the comments. making the kids YOU brought into the world pay rent during a housing crisis is fucking inhumane imo.", "So if your 19  soon to be 20 year old sister doesn\u2019t pay you won\u2019t either? YTA. If she turns 21 and doesn\u2019t pay I will change my mind.", "If your sis is legal age (just like you), then according to your mom's thinking, your sis can pitch in for household bills too. They both have jobs, so work can't be an excuse.\n\nYou're definitely NTA, but if your mom sticks to her stance, it might be time to consider moving out again \u2013 your rules, your place.", "YTA. You have no right to freeload regardless of what your siblings do. It's your parents' right to ask for the rent or not. Pay or move out.", "YTA it's your mom's house her rules. You moved out then back in. I'd expect a bit of help too. Mostly because it's not right to move back home a live off your family. It's also not right to be involved in why or why not siblings are paying. You can always move out, get your own place and pay more.", "NTA -- but start looking for a place of your own, or with a roommate.  Sorry, you are not the golden child.", "I\u2019m the oldest daughter and get similar treatment to this (don\u2019t live at home but I could see this happening to me).\n\nThe way they see it, you were their success having flown the nest so when you moved back they lost that sense of success. They probably want to discourage you from staying living with them whilst also encouraging you to keep working and striving forward.\n\nThey are blind to how old your younger siblings are getting. They are blind to what they\u2019re earning and what they can contribute. You were their \u201cadult\u201d because you moved out, you sister is still their \u201cbaby\u201d because she never left.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for pointing out it isn\u2019t fair but if they push the matter you will either have to pay or move out.", "NTA. it sounds like your mother wants you to pay rent as a lesson of responsibility, which i personally disagree with if the child has shown they\u2019re responsible (paying for groceries, job, contributing to the household and more). she may not think your sister is at an age where she needs that lesson yet.", "I noticed you left out ages to help you out\u2026how old is everyone involved?

Why should the sister 19 be paying rent when OP didn\u2019t have to pay rent at 19? Why should the 19 yo be paying rent just bc a 21 yo has to pay rent? Just bc you paid rent at 18 doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s normal for others to do that.", "According to that thinking, the sister is basically an adult crashing at the folks' place too.

The sister is a legal adult just like OP and works full-time. They can both pay rent if that's what has to happen. Its a 2 year age difference and you're acting like OP is 35 and the sister is 17. Get a grip.", "Op DID pay rent at 18?\u2026. Her parents didn\u2019t pay her rent while she was in school\u2026.? NTA op but you\u2019re probably gonna have to move out sadly haha.

Parents don\u2019t want to charge rent to the younger sibling. Their house. Their choice. Now if the younger sibling is 21/22 and they still refuse to charge her rent I\u2019d agree. But the parents have that choice. OP doesn\u2019t have to live with them.", "OP\u2019s parents didn\u2019t make OP move out and pay rent. OP made a choice to do that.

Personally I couldn\u2019t imagine charging my kiddos rent if they were living at home in their early years but I\u2019m not paying their rent if they move out.", "It\u2019s actually really abnormal. Normally parents don\u2019t get any support before their kids are 18 and if they do (child support/government assistance) that isn\u2019t their primary reason for caring for their children and wanting to set them up for success rather than financially taking from them as early as possible.", "The brother is 17 dude", "Down voted for spitting facts what a world", "Not normal at all. Nope.", "My logic here is that I have paid my own rent since I was 18 due to us living far pretty far from my university, so I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t also contribute given she works full time.", "Yes because moved out and had to pay their own rent for 2 years which I guarantee is much higher than the parents are asking.", "Yep. NC is the answer thanks random pissed of Redditor \ud83d\ude02 If 1-2 year difference completely changes how you treat your children\u2026.
