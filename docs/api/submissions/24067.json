Lauren and I have been best friends since college and have stayed close despite past issues. I think she is a flawed person, but I knew that a lot of it came from self-esteem issues and growing up low-income so I tended to forgive her easily. In college, she struggled a lot with the idea that I was \"better\" than her and took out her insecurities on me. We no longer live in the same state, so I see her a lot less. \n\nLauren couldn't come the first year, but she was very excited for last year's. I flew her out Hawaii. Things were going well at first, but then she became much more snappy and angry with me, for presumably no reason. Throughout the weekend, she made multiple snide remarks about how much money I was spending on the trip and how it showed how privileged I am. She told me that I'm the 1% and then followed it up with \"Fuck the rich, am I right?\". She refused to come eat with us at this nice restaurant because she couldn't afford it, but I had told her multiple times before that I was covering the whole thing. Lauren still refused and tried to sway the other girls into coming to a burger joint with her. We all refused and she started crying and stormed back to the hotel. It made the rest of the dinner/night very awkward for the rest of us. Lauren ended up apologizing the next morning to all of us, but it was very half-assed. Then she \"felt sick\" the next day and stayed back to call her boyfriend for the entire day. I'm not going to lie, she ruined a large part of the trip.\n\nAlthough I was upset after the trip, I reached out to her in a long text and apologized for anything I did to hurt or offend her. She left me on read for four days before responding that she was \"sorry that she was emotional.\" That was it. We still stayed in touch semi-regularly, but haven't seen each other since. \n\nSo for this year's getaway, I chose not to invite her due to her 1) causing drama last time 2) being ungrateful 3) causing the rest of us stress. Lauren heard from one of our mutual friends that she was left out and completely flipped out on me over text, saying I betrayed her, that I was a horrible friend for excluding her, and how hurt she was. I apologized to her, but stated my reasons above and I thought that she would understand, but nope. We called and she claimed that I was gentrifying my social circle and that I had shown my true colors, so on, and that she always knew I valued wealth over friendship. None of that is true and I was deeply hurt by her words. I told her my decision was final and that was that. Except she had her partner reach out to MY husband to shit talk me for being a horrible person. \n\nEven though I think, rationally, I am right, I can't help but feel upset and guilty about this whole thing.

You don't need that energy in your life, and especially not on vacation. It's her own fault if she's left out.", "NTA and honestly you shouldn\u2019t have apologized to her either during the last trip or after. I\u2019m curious what her answer would be if you point blank asked her why she would want to socialize and go on a trip with you considering she had nothing nice to say and disparagingly referred to you as the 1%.", "NTA jealousy is the ugliest quality, really takes over.", "NTA, I can slightly understand her being reluctant to accept being spoilt as maybe she felt like it was a pity hand out?

Quite apart from the fact that she was nasty to you last time, she didn't seem to enjoy the trip, and it is not reasonable of her to think that having behaved badly last year, she should still have an open invitation. \n\nHer response sounds consistent with her other behaviours, so it's not surprising that she got upset and lashed out, but stick to your guns; you've done the right thing.", "She sounds awful. I resent the 1% a little, but that's multi,  multi-millionaire or more levels of wealth, not someone who's doing quite well and is kind enough to invite someone on a trip and pay for it. She just jealous and ungrateful and that's unlikely to change. NTA", "NTA just cut her off. She\u2019s clearly weird and jealous", "she is troubled with you being wealthy. thats on her. not you. NTA", "NTA, but for real, you sound like a great friend! Do you need an internet stranger to fill the spot lol", "In the past, we stayed very close despite being on opposite coasts. We would go a year without seeing each other and it would feel like we were just as close, but you're right in that the last year has been different. Things have been off/more awkward. We grew farther apart. I guess just that was reason enough to not invite her.", "Appreciate this, thank you so much!", "Yeah...I'm starting to think that I've been in an emotionally abusive, toxic friendship for the last decade. I've gone through periods where I vowed to cut her out permanently, but always ended up not in fear of upsetting her or causing drama with the broader friend group.", "Yes. This.   this is a great post.", "You need to prioritize your own well being and mental health.

As a person who did that a few years ago, I say the relief was amazing.\n\n Not having to explain, or to compromise,  or hear the nagging that was her agenda not mine.\n\nSeriously,  just have a brilliant holiday with people who appreciate you.", "Lauren is manipulative and it sounds like maybe she's got some sort of complex or condition. \n\nNTA. Sever ties", "NTA.  I can see that you were in a bit of a tricky position as to whether you should invite her or not, but I can totally understand your reasoning as to why you decided not to invite her in the end.  And her response when she found out the rest of you were going away without her solidifies your decision.  Obviously this friendship is very likely not to recover, but I really don't think you'll be missing out in the long run.  Have a fantastic time away with your other friends though, who obviously won't be dissing your huge generosity.", "NTA for excluding someone who\u2019d made it clear she doesn\u2019t enjoy these trips, but this was a clear friendship-ending move and I\u2019m kind of surprised you didn\u2019t see that. \n\nHow did you *think* she was going to react to being unceremoniously kicked out of the Vacation Gang? She may not have enjoyed her time on these vacations, but that doesn\u2019t mean that being *un-invited* (without even a conversation about it in advance) isn\u2019t going to sting. It\u2019s baffling that you thought she\u2019d be understanding about it when the whole reason you\u2019re kicking her out of this group is because she *isn\u2019t* understanding. She\u2019s angry and envious and those feelings make it impossible for her to accept your generosity with grace - it will make it even more impossible for her to tolerate a snub. Of *course* she went nuclear. As far as she\u2019s concerned, you pressed that button first. \n\nYour friendship with this woman ended permanently the moment you decided to plan a vacation without her. From where I\u2019m sitting, it\u2019s for the best.", "Your not the full AH, but maybe one little pucker around the edge of the sphincter. Why? Because 'treating' your friends to vacations for no specific reason is kinda strange, and could be perceived as a wierd flex / ownership / control. Friendship is about equality, and reciprocity is part of that. Like buying a round of drinks, or tickets to a night out - you do it for me, I'd return the favor next time.  Inviting a poor person to a rich person's event is bound to bring out feelings of resentment, but more than that. I'd feel bad for not being able to do the same for you in return, and she now feels like she owes you, and that you're exerting control over your relationship.\n\nIt's all messed up now in any case. She doesn't truly want to go, and she probably had a bad time last time too, but she still wants to be invited. She probably can't see her own behaviours and motivations, so she'll probably act out again, as she's not rationalised her feelings. But equally neither have you. She's also not a complete AH, as she's just reacting to events honestly.\n\nNotwithstanding, you basically have to cut her loose. She will never thrive in your social circle, and persisting is an unkindness. Instead of worrying about it, just enjoy your time with richer friends.", "NTA- You had given her a chance to talk about what happened the previous trip and she did not.\n\nSome people can't let go of differences like that.", "Lauren has a major hang up which makes your friendship untenable. \n\nShe was not nice in college.\n\nShe was not nice when you treated her to a vacation.\n\nShe is now shit-talking you to your husband? WTF?\n\nThis is not your friend. \n\nNTA", "nta, she is using you for your money. It doesn't matter what you earn, you wanted to do something nice for her, if she can't appreciate that, that's her problem. That she now expects from you that you finance her travels makes me speechless. I would cut contact and tell your husband to do the same.", "Please stop apologizing. It's not your fault. There's nothing you can do to make her happy since her misery in not  caused by you. Let this friendship go. You don't have to be liked by everyone and not every relationship is meant to last. Block her and enjoy your trip. Don't dignify any of her tantrums with any type of response. Have a wonderful time you friends :-)", "LOL she complains about you being able to afford these trips, and then gets mad she doesn\u2019t get a free vacation \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. She is not your friend. Presumably you do have more money than the others, and you do this because you can, and because you want to show you appreciate them. The correct response is either a thank you (and maybe a hostess-style gift along the lines of flowers) or, if someone isn\u2019t comfortable with being treated to the weekend, a gracious refusal of the invitation. Lauren was ungrateful and rude, to your face, and it\u2019s not as though she was forced to attend at gunpoint.. Time for her to go.", "NTA.\n\nYou flew her out to a beautiful tropical location and said you\u2019d cover her for food, etc., and she acted childish and ungrateful.\n\nYou apologized to her afterward when it should have been the other way around, and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to you about it.\n\nSorry to say, but your friendship is over.

She will always resent you.", "NTA. here's the thing, i can kinda get where she may have felt uncomfortable with huge displays of wealth (it's hard to watch someone spend on a dinner what a family member spends on rent) and how it may have caused a moment of freakout. i get it; i didn't grow up poor and still i feel uncomfortable when hearing about how much my wealthy friends spend on this and that when i worry about my parents' healthcare costs. however, she has had a year to process what is going on for her and to apologize for her emotional outbursts-- no matter what the cause, she impacted you and the group. she has had a year to decide if she can handle being in this situation again and to communicate how she would cope differently. the accusation that you are choosing wealth over friendship is baseless--- you're literally spending your money on everyone so everyone can enjoy which shows what you value most of all is this friend group and making sure everyone can attend without worrying about finances. anyone would be lucky to have a friend like you! damn, fly me to hawaii lol i promise i'll be very grateful", "NTA. Lauren is a completely self-absorbed, self-important drama queen. Her having grown up low income has absolutely nothing to do with her behavior. It's just the way she is; she needs to be the center of attention, and when she feels not enough people are paying attention to her, she acts up, plays the victim, etc. Stay away from her; you don't need her brand of crazy in your life.", "Nta she sounds bipolar", "NTA... the lack of invitation was due to the bad behavior the previous trip along with her lack of remorse or accountability.  This is how it is done.", "NTA but stop keeping on apologizing when you're not wrong.", "NTA, if gentrification was like your trips, people would buy the older buildings, fix them up, then give them away to the people who already live there. Which would actually be awesome.", "NTA. Would you like to be my friend? I would not complain about a free girls weekend.", "NTA. She knows she ruined the last trip due to her insecurities and refused to apologize, a REAL apology.  She is using her insecurities to try to excuse her bad behavior and try to make you feel badly about not inviting her.  The fact that she had her partner call YOUR HUSBAND is ridiculous.  She is immature and doesn't deserve your generosity.", "NTA. She has problems and she is projecting them onto you. You don\u2019t need someone like that in your life especially when she is gaslighting you and trying make out you are the problem.", "NTA. She may have her issues but taking it out on other people is not ok. I can understand having a mishap and feeling all these big feelings, but to only half ass the apology when acting out? That would tell me they didn't really reflect on why their behavior was poor to begin with.  \n\n\nIf things are ever in a good spot with her again and if you ever decide to include her, maybe talk things through first. If she really wants to pay for her meals herself, let her I guess. Work on a day you go somewhere cheaper like a burger joint. What you did is incredibly generous and thoughtful. Hopefully Lauren can eventually work through all her issues.", "NTA, I think you handled the situation very well, and really tried to be polite to her. Your \"friend\" is very immature. Dont worry, sometimes life is like this.", "NTA.  She's toxic and she hates you.  Feel free to ghost her.", "\nShe's to blame, but are you alright? This has been the easiest NTA this week. It boggles my mind why you even need to ask us.\n\nYou were kind to ask her to come last time. You don't even see regularly, so this was special. You paid. She was ungrateful. She shat on your gift. She tried to hijack the trip by turning the girls against you. This is craziness. She should have been berated then and there and sent packing. She should have done it herself, but she decided to stay and rain on your parade which you funded.\n\nShe's lucky you still have her number. You don't owe her trips. I wouldn't even want her to come with her own money. This is movie-level batshit crazy. She went to blame you to your husband. \n\nShe needs to work on herself if she wants to save your friendship. I don't blame you if you didn't.", "Hey I\u2019m the first in line to say fuck the rich but unless you are crowdfunding this vacation with the surplus labor value of hundreds of low-paid employees, Lauren\u2019s anger is misdirected. And if you *are* making your vacation money from exploitation, Lauren should be refusing to participate at all.", "NTA. Fuck the rich unless the rich are paying for her to go on a trip. What a wretched hypocrite she is.", "NTA. She sounded exhausting and you sound like a kind and giving friend. You deserve friends who appreciate you and return your efforts in ways that work for them. Enjoy your trip. The loss of this friendship is not on you and you should feel no guilt.", "This girl has a deep seated poverty consciousness and would need therapy or something to change.", "JC if one of my friends asked me on a trip to Hawaii, expenses paid I\u2019d graciously accept and not throw in a \u201cfuck the rich\u201d statement!! You sound like a really caring, sweet friend who has some extra funds and includes her ladies in the fun. NTA. Keep enjoying your life", "I've had friends who have at somepoint started to greatly out earn me. I don't resent them for it. Yeah, it is usually the start of a slow growth apart because I cannot afford to do the things they do. When it happens, I am happy for them. My life is fulfilling as it is simple, and I like that. I would not want to put in the work that they do or make the commitments they make. So, I really consider myself the luckier of us because I can be happy with far less than what satisfies them.", "Healthy individuals dislike the wealthy because they are selfish, not because they are wealthy. So, it is pretty out there that the friend would hate on somebody that was happily spreading the wealth.", "She resents your success and is incredibly jealous. You\u2019re not \u201cgentrifying\u201d, you\u2019re choosing to spend your time and money on people who appreciate you and your generosity. She didn\u2019t. I cannot imagine being so self centered that I\u2019d be rude to someone who paid for me to go on a Hawaiian vacation. \n\nIt\u2019s time to cut her off. She\u2019s not your friend anymore. If you want a final goodbye, tell her that clearly she doesn\u2019t enjoy your company anymore and any mutual respect required for a friendship no longer exists, due to her jealousy and criticisms, so it\u2019s time for you to go your separate ways. \u201cI wish you all the best, but no longer want to maintain a such a one-sided relationship.\u201d\n\nNTA", "I read your first line and was really hoping for a Dr. Seuss-like anti-Lauren poem!", "Stuff 'grateful', she was openly hostile to OP! That not being enough she then tried to ruin it for everyone else as well wonder,  she obviously couldn't stand to see them enjoy themselves.", "Please do it.\n\nI'm not the best at poetry.", "I tell people like her that just because the world is full of cactus doesn't mean you have to sit on them.", "I'll give it a shot!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLauren is a moron, who disses a free trip\n\nShe ruined her fun and made everyone run, because on her shoulder there lives a big chip\n\nThe name of her game is to complain and complain, she sounds like a real fucking drip\n\nOP is the host on a different coast, whose friendship with Lauren she should snip", "That\u2019s fantastic. Wish I\u2019d be likely remember it when it\u2019s relevant and not later while falling asleep haha.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t her therapist. Holidays are for letting your hair down and relaxing, not for counselling a \u201cfriend\u201d. \n\nShe may have been your best friend in college OP but she\u2019s not anymore. You\u2019ve grown and became your own person and you shouldn\u2019t be apologising for that. Where with her she hasn\u2019t grown anything but her resentment towards you. Stop allowing this now. You deserve better. \n\nHave fun on your trip!!", "Uh you listed your reasons wrong. \n\n1. She has something \"morally\" against accepting your generosity. \n\nYou're doing her a favor by not putting her in the position of having to take a stand against your ability to provide a free vacation for her. \n\nIt would be better to be frank with her though. \"In Hawaii, you made it clear that you wouldn't accept me paying for everything and expected everyone to be limited to your budget instead. This year, I will be planning activities within my budget and am more than happy to pay for everything. If this is something you are not comfortable with, I understand and hope that we can still see each other soon. \"", "NTA\nOn another note, can I be your friend?", "Yes, she has issues and no doubt she was deeply hurt.\n\nMy advice to you, stop communicating important topics thru text.  If she was a friend you owe it to her to tell her why you were upset about the last trip after that trip.  Sounds like the communication breakdown was on both sides.\n\nAnd no, you are not the AH for not inviting her on this trip.", "TBH, I\u2019m shocked you didn\u2019t cancel her ticket home and her room the moment she said \u201cF*ck the rich!\u201d I\u2019d have immediately been like, \u201cYou know? You\u2019re right! Eff me! Guess you should figure out your own lodging and airfare home. Byyyyyyeeeeeee!\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Some times you gotta say \"Good riddance to bad rubbish\"", "NTA. I wouldn't invite her, either! You have absolutely NOTHING to feel guilty about! I think you've outgrown this \"friendship.\" It happens. You've been kind and generous and accommodating to this so-called friend and she ruined the vacation for everyone. Just move on. Lauren will never be happy unless she's dragging you down; nobody needs that.", "You are doing her a favor by not inviting her. She\u2019s already proven she\u2019d be miserable.  I\u2019m stunned she even wanted to go. Ditch her.  NTA", "NTA. Honestly, you sound like an amazing person for caring about your friendships enough to take them out on vacation to show your appreciation. Not many have friends like that and I certainly don\u2019t. She should have been grateful, but ultimately she couldn\u2019t get past her own jealousy to just have fun on the trip. Some people can\u2019t do it. She probably struggles with finances and was too lost in her head thinking about what SHE\u2019D do if she had that kind of money rather than appreciate the love you have for your friends willing to spend it on them.", "NTA", "NTA. This person is not your friend.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you take moaning myrtle on another trip so she can ruin it for everyone.  Time to cut ties entirely if she is calling out her monkeys to bother your spouse.", "NTA, she clearly has a lot of inner conflict. She views herself as this woke victim of the social system and wants to remain on her high horse by shitting on the wealthy while actively still enjoying the perks that her rich friend provides for her. \n\n\"We called and she claimed that I was gentrifying my social circle and that I had shown my true colors, so on, and that she always knew I valued wealth over friendship.\"\n\nActually she's the one putting money over her friendships, she clearly can't be friends with someone in a different tax bracket without her insecurities, resentment and hostility showing. You're putting your peace first, there is no reason for you to be so generous to someone who is ungrateful, rude and determined to be miserable and unhappy. If only she knew how to graciously accept your kindness rather than act like a crazy person on a vacation that was fully paid for.", "NTA. College friendships sometimes end during adulthood. It happens.", "NTA\n\nthis bitter broke loser is not your friend. you spent way too much effort even talking to her. \n\nJust straight up tell this person they suck and that they are bitter and broke (emphasis on this part) so they go flip out some more and blame other people for their sad life", "Also, just tell her that it seemed like she didn't enjoy last year's trip at all, and you don't want to force her to be around wealthy people, since she despises them so much.", "Why? Are there people who are defending her behaviour?", "I would tell her that the way she's behaved now is just proving her point. She had no intention of acting better. She wants to go and play the victim-martyr on an all-expenses-paid trip. She loves to wallow in her misery and drag everyone down with her instead of appreciating the wonderful opportunity. I would be thanking her non-stop! NTA. Ho and have a good time without guilt. She's doing this to herself.", "Personally, I think the friend thought the rest of the friend group would feel the same way towards OP as she did. That's why she was making \"eat the rich\" comments and tried to lead a revolt by getting the girls to abandon dinner plans with OP and go to the burger joint. Once she realized she was on her own, she locked herself in her room the rest of the trip. This reminds me of the Shanquella Robinson case. I would not let that \"friend\" anywhere near me.", "Well, there\u2019s no accounting for taste.
