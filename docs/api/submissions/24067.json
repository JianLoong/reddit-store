{"id": 24067, "submission_id": "15kayaq", "title": "AITA for excluding one friend from a group vacation after her behavior on the last vacation?", "selftext": "For the past three years, I've (31F) have had this little tradition of treating my four best girlfriends on a little weekend getaway just to show my appreciation for them. \n\nThe problem friend is \"Lauren\". Lauren and I have been best friends since college and have stayed close despite past issues. I think she is a flawed person, but I knew that a lot of it came from self-esteem issues and growing up low-income so I tended to forgive her easily. In college, she struggled a lot with the idea that I was \"better\" than her and took out her insecurities on me. We no longer live in the same state, so I see her a lot less. \n\nLauren couldn't come the first year, but she was very excited for last year's. I flew her out Hawaii. Things were going well at first, but then she became much more snappy and angry with me, for presumably no reason. Throughout the weekend, she made multiple snide remarks about how much money I was spending on the trip and how it showed how privileged I am. She told me that I'm the 1% and then followed it up with \"Fuck the rich, am I right?\". She refused to come eat with us at this nice restaurant because she couldn't afford it, but I had told her multiple times before that I was covering the whole thing. Lauren still refused and tried to sway the other girls into coming to a burger joint with her. We all refused and she started crying and stormed back to the hotel. It made the rest of the dinner/night very awkward for the rest of us. Lauren ended up apologizing the next morning to all of us, but it was very half-assed. Then she \"felt sick\" the next day and stayed back to call her boyfriend for the entire day. I'm not going to lie, she ruined a large part of the trip.\n\nAlthough I was upset after the trip, I reached out to her in a long text and apologized for anything I did to hurt or offend her. She left me on read for four days before responding that she was \"sorry that she was emotional.\" That was it. We still stayed in touch semi-regularly, but haven't seen each other since. \n\nSo for this year's getaway, I chose not to invite her due to her 1) causing drama last time 2) being ungrateful 3) causing the rest of us stress. Lauren heard from one of our mutual friends that she was left out and completely flipped out on me over text, saying I betrayed her, that I was a horrible friend for excluding her, and how hurt she was. I apologized to her, but stated my reasons above and I thought that she would understand, but nope. We called and she claimed that I was gentrifying my social circle and that I had shown my true colors, so on, and that she always knew I valued wealth over friendship. None of that is true and I was deeply hurt by her words. I told her my decision was final and that was that. Except she had her partner reach out to MY husband to shit talk me for being a horrible person. \n\nEven though I think, rationally, I am right, I can't help but feel upset and guilty about this whole thing.

It is okay to let them go.", "NTA.  Let your other friends know what happened (sounds consistent with the behavior she displayed around them as well), and block her.  Instead of feeling guilty, why not take Lauren's current behavior as confirmation you're making a solid decision?", "NTA. Trust your rational self, and understand that you are upset because this friendship went bad and is now over; and you feel guilty because she is manipulating you with her nonsense. \nYou are showing your friends appreciation, but she is no friend and deserves no appreciation for badmouthing you. Grieve for the end of a friendship and move on.", "NTA -Her insecurities caused her exclusion from the trip. Instead of enjoying the trip and keeping her mouth shut, she was rude & condescending. Time to put this friendship behind ya. Enjoy your trip this year!", "NTA but I actually think the most important thing here is not last year's trip, but what happened afterwards. You understand she's got complicated issues around money/class and were still prepared to try to connect and repair things after last year. She didn't communicate at all. She didn't explain, didn't apologize for specifics, didn't indicate she valued the friendship, didn't help you understand, didn't do anything to suggest she values your connection. After all that she somehow expected you to feel the same level of closeness to her somehow? She was hurtful and complicated and she did nothing about it, and she has not done much to maintain the relationship since. Why would you invite her? You feel guilty cause you see where she's coming from emotionally, given her childhood, and you still care and it hurts to act on the reality of the friendship as it is now. But all she had to do was talk and you wouldn't be in this situation. You didn't need her to be perfect, just to act like someone who cares about you.", "NTA. She is rude and ungrateful.", "NTA\n\nShe clearly did not enjoy herself, pooped the party and then pitched a fit. You don\u2019t have to put good money after bad. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "Lol! Can I be your friend Op?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI'm having a hard time understanding why, after all of the shit she has shoveled at you over the years, you are still friends with her. She has passive aggressively insulted you for having money numerous times, and talks shit about you to your face about having money. \n\nShe sounds insanely ungrateful and, was actually openly hostile during an all expenses paid trip. This is not somebody you should have around, or even spend your money on because it brings everyone on the whole trip down. \n\nIt's really time you cut ties with this non-friend.", "This friendship has run it's course and is over. You sound like a kind generous person to worry if you're wrong here but you're definitely not. This women is jealous and insecure and you've been far more patient than most people would have been. NTA.", "NTA \nI think that she was never a true friend. You don't need to apologize for being generous, to ungrateful people like her.

I understand feeling insecure about wealth disparity. But she was perfectly happy to go on vacation on your dime. It feels like some kind of demented virtue signalling to let you pay for all the properly expensive parts, then act like you're throwing it in her face buying dinner.\n\nShe's happy to benefit from your wealth, but only if she can make herself somehow morally superior. You don't need that energy in your life, and especially not on vacation. It's her own fault if she's left out.", "NTA and honestly you shouldn\u2019t have apologized to her either during the last trip or after. I\u2019m curious what her answer would be if you point blank asked her why she would want to socialize and go on a trip with you considering she had nothing nice to say and disparagingly referred to you as the 1%.", "NTA jealousy is the ugliest quality, really takes over.", "NTA, I can slightly understand her being reluctant to accept being spoilt as maybe she felt like it was a pity hand out? But if so she didn't need to be so rude and ungrateful to you. I don't think your unreasonable for not wanting to bring someone on holiday all expenses paid after that much drama", "NTA and this friendship has run its course.", "NTA,  I've learned that just some friends you are not able to travel with and that is okay.", "NTA. Quite apart from the fact that she was nasty to you last time, she didn't seem to enjoy the trip, and it is not reasonable of her to think that having behaved badly last year, she should still have an open invitation. \n\nHer response sounds consistent with her other behaviours, so it's not surprising that she got upset and lashed out, but stick to your guns; you've done the right thing.", "She sounds awful. I resent the 1% a little, but that's multi,  multi-millionare or more levels of wealth, not someone who's doing quite well and is kind enough to invite someone on a trip and pay for it. She just jealous and ungrateful and that's unlikely to change. NTA", "NTA just cut her off. She\u2019s clearly weird and jealous", "she is troubled with you being wealthy. thats on her. not you. NTA", "NTA, but for real, you sound like a great friend! Do you need an internet stranger to fill the spot lol", "In the past, we stayed very close despite being on opposite coasts. We would go a year without seeing each other and it would feel like we were just as close, but you're right in that the last year has been different. Things have been off/more awkward. We grew farther apart. I guess just that was reason enough to not invite her.", "Appreciate this, thank you so much!", "Yeah...I'm starting to think that I've been in an emotionally abusive, toxic friendship for the last decade. I've gone through periods where I vowed to cut her out permanently, but always ended up not in fear of upsetting her or causing drama with the broader friend group.", "Yes. This.   this is a great post.", "You need to prioritize your own well being and mental health. I'd cut off whoever starts drama because of this too. \n\nWish you all the best in the future without that toxic friend.", "Just cut her.  As a person who did that a few years ago, I say the relief was amazing.\n\n Not having to explain, or to compromise,  or hear the nagging that was her agenda not mine.\n\nSeriously,  just have a brilliant holiday with people who appreciate you."]}
