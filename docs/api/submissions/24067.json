Lauren and I have been best friends since college and have stayed close despite past issues. I think she is a flawed person, but I knew that a lot of it came from self-esteem issues and growing up low-income so I tended to forgive her easily. In college, she struggled a lot with the idea that I was \"better\" than her and took out her insecurities on me. We no longer live in the same state, so I see her a lot less. \n\nLauren couldn't come the first year, but she was very excited for last year's. I flew her out Hawaii. Things were going well at first, but then she became much more snappy and angry with me, for presumably no reason. Throughout the weekend, she made multiple snide remarks about how much money I was spending on the trip and how it showed how privileged I am. She told me that I'm the 1% and then followed it up with \"Fuck the rich, am I right?\". She refused to come eat with us at this nice restaurant because she couldn't afford it, but I had told her multiple times before that I was covering the whole thing. Lauren still refused and tried to sway the other girls into coming to a burger joint with her. We all refused and she started crying and stormed back to the hotel. It made the rest of the dinner/night very awkward for the rest of us. Lauren ended up apologizing the next morning to all of us, but it was very half-assed. Then she \"felt sick\" the next day and stayed back to call her boyfriend for the entire day. I'm not going to lie, she ruined a large part of the trip.\n\nAlthough I was upset after the trip, I reached out to her in a long text and apologized for anything I did to hurt or offend her. She left me on read for four days before responding that she was \"sorry that she was emotional.\" That was it. We still stayed in touch semi-regularly, but haven't seen each other since. \n\nSo for this year's getaway, I chose not to invite her due to her 1) causing drama last time 2) being ungrateful 3) causing the rest of us stress. Lauren heard from one of our mutual friends that she was left out and completely flipped out on me over text, saying I betrayed her, that I was a horrible friend for excluding her, and how hurt she was. I apologized to her, but stated my reasons above and I thought that she would understand, but nope. We called and she claimed that I was gentrifying my social circle and that I had shown my true colors, so on, and that she always knew I valued wealth over friendship. None of that is true and I was deeply hurt by her words. I told her my decision was final and that was that. Except she had her partner reach out to MY husband to shit talk me for being a horrible person. \n\nEven though I think, rationally, I am right, I can't help but feel upset and guilty about this whole thing.

You don't need that energy in your life, and especially not on vacation. It's her own fault if she's left out.", "NTA and honestly you shouldn\u2019t have apologized to her either during the last trip or after. I\u2019m curious what her answer would be if you point blank asked her why she would want to socialize and go on a trip with you considering she had nothing nice to say and disparagingly referred to you as the 1%.", "NTA jealousy is the ugliest quality, really takes over.", "NTA, I can slightly understand her being reluctant to accept being spoilt as maybe she felt like it was a pity hand out?

Quite apart from the fact that she was nasty to you last time, she didn't seem to enjoy the trip, and it is not reasonable of her to think that having behaved badly last year, she should still have an open invitation. \n\nHer response sounds consistent with her other behaviours, so it's not surprising that she got upset and lashed out, but stick to your guns; you've done the right thing.", "She sounds awful. I resent the 1% a little, but that's multi,  multi-millionaire or more levels of wealth, not someone who's doing quite well and is kind enough to invite someone on a trip and pay for it. She just jealous and ungrateful and that's unlikely to change. NTA", "NTA just cut her off. She\u2019s clearly weird and jealous", "she is troubled with you being wealthy. thats on her. not you. NTA", "NTA, but for real, you sound like a great friend! Do you need an internet stranger to fill the spot lol", "In the past, we stayed very close despite being on opposite coasts. We would go a year without seeing each other and it would feel like we were just as close, but you're right in that the last year has been different. Things have been off/more awkward. We grew farther apart. I guess just that was reason enough to not invite her.", "Appreciate this, thank you so much!", "Yeah...I'm starting to think that I've been in an emotionally abusive, toxic friendship for the last decade. I've gone through periods where I vowed to cut her out permanently, but always ended up not in fear of upsetting her or causing drama with the broader friend group.", "Yes. This.   this is a great post.", "You need to prioritize your own well being and mental health.

As a person who did that a few years ago, I say the relief was amazing.\n\n Not having to explain, or to compromise,  or hear the nagging that was her agenda not mine.\n\nSeriously,  just have a brilliant holiday with people who appreciate you.", "Lauren is manipulative and it sounds like maybe she's got some sort of complex or condition. \n\nNTA. Sever ties", "NTA.  I can see that you were in a bit of a tricky position as to whether you should invite her or not, but I can totally understand your reasoning as to why you decided not to invite her in the end.  And her response when she found out the rest of you were going away without her solidifies your decision.  Obviously this friendship is very likely not to recover, but I really don't think you'll be missing out in the long run.  Have a fantastic time away with your other friends though, who obviously won't be dissing your huge generosity.", "NTA for excluding someone who\u2019d made it clear she doesn\u2019t enjoy these trips, but this was a clear friendship-ending move and I\u2019m kind of surprised you didn\u2019t see that. \n\nHow did you *think* she was going to react to being unceremoniously kicked out of the Vacation Gang? She may not have enjoyed her time on these vacations, but that doesn\u2019t mean that being *un-invited* (without even a conversation about it in advance) isn\u2019t going to sting. It\u2019s baffling that you thought she\u2019d be understanding about it when the whole reason you\u2019re kicking her out of this group is because she *isn\u2019t* understanding. She\u2019s angry and envious and those feelings make it impossible for her to accept your generosity with grace - it will make it even more impossible for her to tolerate a snub. Of *course* she went nuclear. As far as she\u2019s concerned, you pressed that button first. \n\nYour friendship with this woman ended permanently the moment you decided to plan a vacation without her. From where I\u2019m sitting, it\u2019s for the best.", "Your not the full AH, but maybe one little pucker around the edge of the sphincter. Why? Because 'treating' your friends to vacations for no specific reason is kinda strange, and could be perceived as a wierd flex / ownership / control. Friendship is about equality, and reciprocity is part of that. Like buying a round of drinks, or tickets to a night out - you do it for me, I'd return the favor next time.  Inviting a poor person to a rich person's event is bound to bring out feelings of resentment, but more than that. I'd feel bad for not being able to do the same for you in return, and she now feels like she owes you, and that you're exerting control over your relationship.\n\nIt's all messed up now in any case. She doesn't truly want to go, and she probably had a bad time last time too, but she still wants to be invited. She probably can't see her own behaviours and motivations, so she'll probably act out again, as she's not rationalised her feelings. But equally neither have you. She's also not a complete AH, as she's just reacting to events honestly.\n\nNotwithstanding, you basically have to cut her loose. She will never thrive in your social circle, and persisting is an unkindness. Instead of worrying about it, just enjoy your time with richer friends.", "NTA- You had given her a chance to talk about what happened the previous trip and she did not.\n\nSome people can't let go of differences like that.", "Lauren has a major hang up which makes your friendship untenable. \n\nShe was not nice in college.\n\nShe was not nice when you treated her to a vacation.\n\nShe is now shit-talking you to your husband? WTF?\n\nThis is not your friend. \n\nNTA", "nta, she is using you for your money. It doesn't matter what you earn, you wanted to do something nice for her, if she can't appreciate that, that's her problem. That she now expects from you that you finance her travels makes me speechless. I would cut contact and tell your husband to do the same.", "Please stop apologizing. It's not your fault. There's nothing you can do to make her happy since her misery in not  caused by you. Let this friendship go. You don't have to be liked by everyone and not every relationship is meant to last. Block her and enjoy your trip. Don't dignify any of her tantrums with any type of response. Have a wonderful time you friends :-)", "LOL she complains about you being able to afford these trips, and then gets mad she doesn\u2019t get a free vacation \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. She is not your friend. Presumably you do have more money than the others, and you do this because you can, and because you want to show you appreciate them. The correct response is either a thank you (and maybe a hostess-style gift along the lines of flowers) or, if someone isn\u2019t comfortable with being treated to the weekend, a gracious refusal of the invitation. Lauren was ungrateful and rude, to your face, and it\u2019s not as though she was forced to attend at gunpoint.. Time for her to go.", "NTA.\n\nYou flew her out to a beautiful tropical location and said you\u2019d cover her for food, etc., and she acted childish and ungrateful.\n\nYou apologized to her afterward when it should have been the other way around, and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to you about it.\n\nSorry to say, but your friendship is over.
