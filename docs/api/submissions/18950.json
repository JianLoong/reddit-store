{"id": 18950, "submission_id": "140ct2i", "title": "AITA for asking my brother to pay my legal fees from his inheritance?", "selftext": "Two year ago my grandfather died and our fathers sister (aunt) was the executor of our grandfathers estate. In our country if your parent was meant to get a distribution of the estate but they have passed it goes to their children. Well my dad (also my brothers dad) has passed away so we should legally be entitled to his share. Our aunt (executor) said that there was no estate. \n\nA few months after grandpa passed away I began to get suspicious as my aunt and her husband spent a lot of money on a new car, holidays, cruises, renovations, etc. I decided to ask a lawyer if anything could be done. The lawyer offered to take on myself and my brothers case at no cost, just 30 percent of the amount if we won. If we changed our minds or dropped the case or misrepresented anything we\u2019d be liable for hourly costs of the lawyer.\n\nI asked my brother if he wanted to join, and explained everything. I also told him I got in just before the statue of limitations ended so this was his only chance. I did all the work, research, hiring a lawyer, finding information and the house sale, etc. He did it think it was worth it to join. \n\nMy brother was vehemently against it, he said I could do what I wanted but he didn\u2019t care about the money and wanted nothing to do with my aunt so he\u2019d stay out of it. I respected what he said and went in alone, taking on the risk alone. If anything had gone wrong I\u2019d be paying alone. My brother would have no liability to pay. \n\nWell I received a settlement offer yesterday which seems fair, it also includes my brother. My lawyer refuses to negotiate the settlement at all because it includes my brother. He said my brother isn\u2019t his client so he can\u2019t negotiate. As it currently stands I get significantly less than my brother as 100 percent of the legal fees come from my portion. For example I get $14000 and he gets $20000, because I have to pay $6000 legal fees. I am suggesting a distribution of $17,500 and $16,500 because I did literally everything and took the risk on alone. \n\nIf I reject the settlement offer and either counter offer or let it go to trial my brother is not guaranteed to be included anymore. Now that there\u2019s a real possibility of money on the table he\u2019s completely flip flopped and wants me to accept the offer which includes him. Because he isn\u2019t a client it\u2019s the only way that he would be included. In my opinion he had the chance to join when I literally offered it to him a year ago but he chose not to join because he didn\u2019t think it would go anywhere. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want him to get nothing and I\u2019m happy enough with the settlement offer I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to pay all the legal fees when without me he would literally have no settlement at all. If he didn\u2019t flip flop and had joined in the beginning we could counter and negotiate more of what we are entitled to. \n\nMy brother now says he really wants this money and is asking me to do anything to keep him included so he wants me to accept it as even countering it means he\u2019s out. I\u2019m happy to do that for him but it does mean I\u2019m taking a loss - in the offer it says I\u2019m entitled to 60 percent more so I had planned to counter before my brother asked me to just accept to basically ensure he\u2019s still involved.\n\nIs it fair since I did everything to expect my brother to pay slightly more legal fees than me? Again without me having done this and settled the way I have agreed to he would have zero and never be able to get anything because the statue of limitations has passed.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nUpdate \n\nJust to clarify I am accepting the settlement and splitting it with my brother. I am not going to counter and have him dropped and no matter what I never would allow him to be dropped because he changed his mind. My only question is given I took the risk, the liability, I was responsible for legal fees if i failed, I did the work,,,, is asking for 1.5% more overall fair?  \n\nI want my brother to succeed and be part of this, I\u2019d not want him to lose out on anything but I\u2019d resent him if he did nothing, took no risk, had no stress, no research work or liability and then got more than me or even the same amount. I risked so much taking this battle on alone. He wants to join cause it\u2019s succeeding and it doesn\u2019t seem fair to get an equal share having skipped out on all the risk - but getting all the rewards", "created_utc": 1685884657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140ct2i/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_pay_my_legal_fees/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you\u2019re like \u201cforget that, I should get part of the extra 15% we get by not having my brother be a client of the lawyer.\u201d\n\nAssuming I\u2019m getting that right, then out of everyone involved: you, brother, Aunt+Uncle, lawyer\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this, I will never say it again and I will deny ever having said this\u2026 but ESH but the lawyer.", "If you reject the offer and go trial and win by yourself you stand to win at least $40 000 the way I read it. Can't you follow this route win the money subtract the legal fees and them spilt it the way you want? \n\nWhat I'm getting at is can't you go to trial win the money in your name and then spilt the proceeds with your brother in good faith?", "Didn\u2019t the lawyer agree to take a third? They should be willing to do whatever work it takes without charging you more than the agreed upon amount. They are already getting a big payday \u2014 make them work for it", "Tough luck. He made his choice earlier. You\u2019ve done all the work. Personally, I\u2019d cut him out of the settlement and then gift him a third of the total or whatever is fair if you calculate the value of your work. He would have nothing without you so he\u2019s lucky if you gift him anything.", "Yes. Yes they did completely misunderstand. I don't know what's going on with these comments but most of them have definitely got the wrong end of the stick", "A third of their clients amount. His part of the settlement is without any fees cause he\u2019s not a client. Also just a side note if I dropped out of the case at any point I would have been the only liable party to pay the legal fees at an hourly rate, so another thing with me saying I was taking on the risk - I don\u2019t think he should be entitled to the same reward having avoided the risk and joined the reap the rewards.", "A third of OP\u2019s share though, I think? So nothing from the brothers share.", "This, exactly!  Brother made his choice.  You took on all the risk and work so proceed as originally planned.  Plus, this initial offer is likely a low ball offer.  Hold out for more or go to trial.", "I think very few of the commenters passing judgment understand the situation. NTA That being said your lawyer is giving you some very strange advice and seems to be working more in his own interest than yours (which sucks). If I were you I'd counter and pay your brother what you think is fair from the settlement you get up to and no more than the 50% he's willing to settle for now.", "If you put a lot of time into this, then you deserve at least half.", "Why are you so invested?", "Given all of the additional info you have put in your post, I don't understand why you don't counter and then gift him his share of the inheritance after. It sounds like you would both get more.", "Honestly get what you can. He didn\u2019t want to be apart so if he gets nothing too bad. NTA.", "Make your brother sign a contract to keep him involved. If not, contest it or whatever. But he should have to split the fees 50/50", "NTA Don't settle. Counter and it should raise the sum alot, especially as your aunt comitted fraud which you can sue for", "That\u2019s what I think, but also with me doing all the work and taking all the risk of having to pay the legal fees if we failed then should we really get an equal payout?", "I don\u2019t know if we can prove she committed fraud cause she\u2019s join on all his accounts.", "It also would get us less overall", "Tell your brother that if you accept the offer, he needs to give you money from his share to make the total settlement after fess 50/50. Get it in writing and notarized. If your brother refuses, do what you want on you own and exclude him. Easy.", "That sounds like his problem, not yours.", "Counter it unless he signs something helping with YOU with legal fees.", "Why don't you ask your lawyer if it's possible that they can draw up a legally binding agreement between you and your brother in which you agree to accept the settlement and in return he agrees to reimburse you for half the legal costs from his share of the settlement?", "I am very nervous as to how he\u2019s going to react to feeling like I don\u2019t trust him, but at the end of the day I know it\u2019s best to get things in writing", "Also side note if I dropped out only I would have had to take the loss of paying the hourly fee to the lawyer for work done", "Kind of- so first off if anything happened and I backed out me and me alone would be liable for the legal fees - which is what I mean by I took on the liability. \n\nAs for the legal fees - it\u2019s up to my brother if he wants to be a client or not. He doesn\u2019t want to be a client but he wants the settlement. \n\nIf he joined and we tried a counter we\u2019d already be losing a bunch more money to legal fees that wouldn\u2019t make it worth risking passing up the settlement for a counter offer. \n\nThe lawyer is being paid extremely well for this as it stands with only me as a client- he\u2019s making approx 10000 more than had he charged hourly. He also has not done much. He filed a motion to the courts based on all the information I gave him and that was it. Besides that it was waiting.\n\nMy point in all this is my brother should not be able to avoid all risk and liability, put in zero work, change his mind, and then join in the end and then expect an equal or more amount for a settlement. \n\nShould there not be a benefit for being the person who took on all risk and liability, who did all the work, and who is now happy to keep my brother on the settlement rather than dropping him and trying to go for more alone?\n\nI definitely don\u2019t think everyone but the lawyer is the asshole here - I am trying to do whats best for me and my brother both, I\u2019m just feeling that after everything I\u2019ve done, the stress and risk, etc that it makes sense for me to be compensated a bit more. I\u2019m not ever going to drop my brother or try to screw him over, I\u2019m trying to be fair and I think that if we got equal or him more after the risk and everything that I did it would leave me feeling resentful towards him. \n\nI hope that makes sense and explains my stance.", "If I reject I\u2019d be fighting only for my share and not my brothers. I\u2019m going to accept it\u2019s just a question of is asking for a percent and a half more for taking on the risk, doing the work, having the stress, etc is that fair. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. I personally think it is but we\u2019ve gotten off track with suggestions to reject it and go for gold myself and then split it. It\u2019s better for us both to be involved and I want to benefit my brother.", "So counter offer to the lawyer. He should be willing to do a tiny bit of extra work at this point for less than 30%.", "He literally told me he refuses to do anything else because he\u2019s only getting 30 percent of my part and not of the whole thing so either drop my brother and try to get more or keep my brother and accept", "NTA. Make him sign a legal document agreeing that he will reimburse you for the legal fees out of his portion before you accept, though.", "I think you two should split the legal fees 50/50 and call it a day before you end up straining your relationship with each other. There's what you think is fair, what Reddit thinks is fair and there is what is worth more to you. The slightly more money or resentment straining a decent relationship if he doesn't agree.", "Could a condition of the promissory note use the inheritance as collateral?", "Be careful with that. That can start fights that possibly didn't need to happen. If you act like he's trying to screw you over when he hasn't tried to so far then it could cost you a brother. Just go 50/50.", "Sounds like he's trying to bluff you. It would certainly be a lot more work for him to take it to trial, with an uncertain outcome, than to just write a counteroffer for you and your brother.", "You can always gift money to your brother later! If they're willing to settle for that much there's probably a lot more they owe you", "NTA.\nI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re quibbling about 1.5%. You were the only one interested in pursuing the legal path, so any outcome should be solely for your benefit. If your brother now wants the free money he\u2019s getting, he needs to compensate you for any loss you incur in changing your next step for his benefit.\nI think a fair thing to ask is that he fully cover the legal fees if you accept the settlement. He\u2019s still getting free money - money he would never see otherwise. So with your example numbers you should get $20,000 and he should get $14,000 (get written agreement about him paying you $6000 better you accept the settlement).\nHe can\u2019t complain - he gets $14,000 with no effort on his part", "Depends. Do you mean 50/50 of what\u2019s left after the lawyer gets his cut, or 50/50 of the full amount which means OP gets much less than the brother?", "He had the same opportunity as you and was asked to join.", "Would the amount go up if you counter? If so counter and then give him his cut", "I mean, the brother knew what was happening, waited for OP to do all the work and now wants in and OP will get less as a result.. sounds like he kind of IS screwing OP over.\n\n50/50 is fair but it\u2019s shitty of the brother. He should offer to pay a higher percentage of the lawyers fees.", "Fwiw, I think it\u2019s very fair, for all the reasons you\u2019ve explained. Brother should be happy to get that much since you did all the work & he wasn\u2019t willing to risk anything.   \n\n\n(If he insists on getting a larger share than you \u2018cause all the fees come out of your half, then he\u2019s the one damaging your relationship. Not you.)", "I mean the attitude of always being on the defense. In general that can cost you relationships if you go in defensive mode all the time and acting like you have to protect yourself from them. Then fights start or get bigger or they feel less inclined to agree or compromise if they get defensive because you came out being defensive before the fight even started. And if they do 50/50 it's the same cost to both and it ends now. You thinking he should doesn't mean he will and is 1.5% worth kicking off another family fight over the same money. He could think OP is being greedy and he *might* agree to pay the higher amount but then it strains relations with him right after losing dad and aunt to the battle. You have to pick which is more valuable to you in the long run sometimes even if it means losing a bit of ground or things aren't as exactly fair as you think.", "Except it\u2019s not going to be 50:50 at all because the brother isn\u2019t the lawyer\u2019s client, so OP will get less money. I get your point about being on the defensive, but in this case it\u2019s valid.", "Then that's the choice you would make and OP can pick theirs. Each has it's drawbacks and you pick what price are you willing to pay for what is a few hundred dollars."]}
