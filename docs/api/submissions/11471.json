I have a friend Tom(16M), who has two moms. Our parents are friends, we went to the same elementary school, known each other for basically all our lives, and now we go to the same highschool. Him and his parents are all friendly people who constantly are over at our house for dinner or to watch football games. \n\nMy chemistry class was doing a lab the other day and I was in a group with Tom, and two others. Me, Tom, and one of the others were working on the lab together, while the other person (we can call Kate) was talking to her friends. We were working on the lab write up at a table when Kate came over and asked me for the data we collected. I didn\u2019t care enough to not give it to her, so I was about to hand her my paper to copy when her friend walked over and asked her why she was talking to me and the \u2018f*g\u2019. Kate laughed and I was pretty grossed out by it. She just walked away without my paper so I assumed she wasn\u2019t going to take the answers, and I didn\u2019t call after her. \n\nA couple days pass and the lab was due. As everyone was turning it in Kate walked up to the teacher and complained that she didn\u2019t have the data needed to fill out the lab. The teacher said that it was her fault. She ended up getting a zero on it and is failing the class. Since she is now failing a class she is not allowed to play a sport in the spring. Since we are all juniors this is a very important time for people to prepare for and get recruited for college. She is essentially the best of her sport and is in line to play at a Division 2 school with scholarship. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue. A scholarship was basically the only way Kate could go to college. Otherwise she would be practically swimming in debt. I know this because our moms are friends. My mom received an angry phone call from her friend (Kate's mom) saying that I basically failed her daughter and ruined her life. She said there was no way she could get an academic scholarship and now would have to be paying off student loans for the rest of her life. My mom asked me why I didn\u2019t help Kate and I explained the whole situation. My mom then called her friend up again and blew up on her about her homophobic daughter. \n\nBoth of my parents think that it wasn\u2019t my fault but I just feel icky about it. I know that Kate has a lot of issues, like an absent father and a struggling mom who works several jobs, and I know sports were one of her only outlets, but her reaction to her friend's comment just sucked. Especially as someone who has been experimenting lately it really hurts to see how kids in my school are. Seeing what people say in front of teachers makes me wonder what they say to him when nobody else is around. While I think she deserved some karma, I hate how extreme this was. I feel crappy about it and just want to know if I\u2019m an AH for not helping her to begin with.\n\nEdit: Spacing", "created_utc": 1677941267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0wbi/aita_for_letting_a_girl_fail_chemistry_over_a/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is Kate\u2019s own responsibility to collect this data and if you did it, why couldn\u2019t she? And she could have asked help from the teacher or other friends as well. It is still her own responsibility to ask for help, so I\u2019m sure you would have helped her if she asked for it. And she was rude for laughing about it, but you were offering to help her and she walked away.", ">She just walked away without my paper so I assumed she wasn\u2019t going to take the answers, and I didn\u2019t call after her. \n\n>A couple days pass and the lab was due.

I'm wondering what Kate's reasoning is for not taking the paper of data (OP said she just walked away) and for apparently not saying or doing anything about it until the lab was due.\n\nThe whole laughing at a slur issue just looks to me to have very little to do with Kate not getting the data to do the lab (which may not have been done anyway even with the data).\n\nMaybe OP would've called Kate back to get the paper if Kate had merely gotten distracted by an innocuous comment by her friend. But it would've also been reasonable of OP to not bother to remind Kate of the paper she asked for even in that less offensive situation.\n\nKate is TA for trying to blame OP for her own forgetfulness as well as her own lack of initiative in trying to get the data afterwards or even discussing with the teacher before lab was due.", "NTA.  \n\nFirst, I applaud you for being empathetic.  Second, this is truly on Kate; not her friend.\n\nWhy is it on Kate?  She could have done the lab work herself.  That was her actual responsibility.  Her backup plan was to essentially cheat.  OK, fine.  Her friend comes over and says something offensive.  You would have still shared your data.  She essentially joined in by laughing and walking away.  Now it is on Kate, not her friend.  She walked away without the data.  Kate walked away.  Kate could have asked someone else; she didn\u2019t.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t really karma but rather direct cause and effect.  A different analogy.  Let\u2019s say Kate has a job and lives in an apartment.  She quits her job to spend more time hanging with her friends.  Now can\u2019t pay rent.  She asks you for money, and you are inclined to help, then her friend shows up and insults you.  Kate then laughs and walks away.  Kate then gets evicted.  Not your fault.\n\nThe consequences were large but not as large as her mom suggests.  If she is great athlete, she might get a scholarship at a naia school or be a walk on looking for a spot.  \n\nFinally, Kate needs to learn there are consequences to behavior.  This begins with her simply not doing her own school work.  It ends with her walking away from any help.  This isn\u2019t about Kate\u2019s friend, it is about Kate.\n\nETA: It is highly unlikely that this one instance is what caused her to be academically ineligible.  In other words, while this might have been the proverbial straw there were numerous other instances where Kate failed to do the academic work.", "I\u2019m sorry maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding something. \u201cKate\u201d failed to participate in the group assignment and elected to spend time with her friends and it\u2019s YOUR fault that she didn\u2019t have the assignment completed?!  I\u2019m assuming that \u201cKate\u201d was also well aware that failing that class will adversely affect her chances to play sports and obtain a scholarship, right? Perhaps instead of Kate\u2019s parent calling to malign your name, she could have spent that energy teaching \u201cKate\u201d how to take responsibility for her own actions, or inaction, and to realize now she will have to suffer the consequences. My God the entitlement of some folks. Basically mad because you didn\u2019t help her cheat. If she doesn\u2019t get a scholarship it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t deserve one. NTA", "NTA. Even without her disgusting homophobia, it is HER job to get the data she needs to do an assignment. It is not your job to chase her down and give it to her. She can swim in that debt and I wish her well of it.", "NTA. For multiple reasons, but if you still feel guilty despite her actions there is no way a 0 on one assignment would cause her to fail if she was doing reasonably well beforehand.", "NTA, Kate didn't keep track of her assignments, she deserves the grade she gets from that.", "NTA if she can't pass the course without cheating, that is her fault, not yours.", "NTA! \\[I taught public high school chemistry for 31 years.\\] \"Kate has a lot of issues\". True. Among them: Being a lab parasite. Too often I saw slackers try to ditch the labwork and copy others' data. Being a a homophobe, no excuse. Failing to take responsibility for her own actions. \n\nPlease do not feel crappy. You've taken the high road.", "NTA. This is all on Kate. The interaction with her friend that resulted in her not getting that paper may have been the one part of this that you intersected with. But it is still a byproduct of Kate's failures.\n\nKate needed that data from you because she was talking with her friends, instead of doing the lab and collecting the data herself. Lab data that, unless I miss my guess, her friends should have been working on collecting also.\n\nShe should have been with your group collecting the data. If she didn't want to do it with your group, she could have been collecting the data with them.\n\nThere's more to it than that though.\n\nWhen the teacher said it was \"her fault\" when she approached them, it is likely because they remembered her standing around talking instead of doing the lab. Could they have provided an out for her? Sure. But when you know someone wasn't even trying, the willingness to provide assistance tends to fade away.\n\nAlso, Kate is not failing the class because of one missed lab. If it were one missed lab, she should be looking at a letter grade difference at worst. If even that. That she's failing because of this means she's probably botched multiple homeworks and labs, blown multiple tests.\n\nThis was not a sudden thing. She had to have known her grade was at risk. Yet, she still choose to blow off doing the lab to hang out with her friends.\n\nNote also that after the class was over, Kate had two days **and** multiple people to try to get the lab data from. You, the third person that was working with you and Tom, her friends. Yet she still ended up opting to try to sob story the teacher.\n\nLast thing. What happened to Kate... You can call it karma if you want. I'd call it results of a lack of character and work ethic on her part. Not something you had anything to do with.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You stood up for your friend. This is completely on Kate.", "NTA\nHas it occurred to Kate to just do her own tasks? \"You did not let me cheat on my assignment, it's your fault I failed\" doesn't work much in the real world.", "NTA - it\u2019s kind of you to be worried about her, but she chose to ignore the assignment in class. \n\nShe then chose not to do anything in the intervening days before the Lab report was due (she didn\u2019t find you to ask for it or ask friends for the info, or go to the teacher and say \u201cI messed up, is there any way I can sample data to work with\u201d). \n\nShe also, knowing the rules about grades and sports, and knowing how important playing sports was to her future, allowed her grades to dip so low that one lab report brought her down to failing. \n\nNone of that is on you, it\u2019s just easier for her and her mom to blame someone other than herself.", "Nta, she asked for the data, forgot she asked, left without asking again. You didn\u2019t even refuse to give it. There was nothing you could have done for her, and no one would run after someone to give them the answers of an exam.", "NTA. The whole situation is unjust in the sense that the consequences for Kate are way, way too harsh considering what she did, but that is the system's fault, not yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her mother was way out of line but I'm fairly certain Kate lied to her.", "So, she just walked away without taking the data from you (not like you would give it to her apparently, but she could have tried).

She should have done her own work and not depend on other people. If she can\u2019t pass chemistry in high school without help from other people, maybe college isn\u2019t for her. Either way, it\u2019s not your fault. Not all all. You could have helped her pass, but that doesn\u2019t help her when she\u2019s becoming dependent on other people to succeed. She needs to step up to the plate and pass her classes herself!", "NTA. She was dicking around with her friends instead of doing her work, and then even when she tried to mooch off your effort, decided validating her AH friend's homophobia was more important than copying your work.\n\nAnd while it's possible this individual lab was worth like 30% of your course grade, it's more likely that this zero was one more bad grade in a string of them - if she relies on copying from good students instead of doing the labs and learning the materials, she's probably bombing the other assignments too.\n\nYou didn't cause her to fail, her lazy entitled behavior just bit her in the ass.

She's not failing because of ONE missed lab. She's failing because of a consistent lack of effort.

She, literally, chose homophobia over her lab responsibility.

She asked OP for the data and then walked away without getting a copy. That's on Kate and no one else. She's a junior and responsible for her own assignments. It sucks she'll lose out on a scholarship but that due to her own actions and not to a comment she laughed at.", "Thank you! It\u2019s nice to hear a teacher\u2019s perspective on this!", "After reading I am not sure how OP is even responsible. Friend said something offensive and Kate laughed and walked away without the data. It doesn't sound like OP told her off. Kate was too lazy to do the assignment and apparently to lazy to cheat off someone else either.  NTA", "As I said in my own comment, Kate is not failing that class because of one missed lab.\n\nIf she were performing well otherwise, a single missed lab would be at worst a shift between one (passing) letter grade and another (passing) letter grade.\n\nThat missing the lab now has her failing the class means that she was already close enough to failing to be at risk. This may be one of several labs not turned in, or done incorrectly. Maybe multiple homeworks not turned in or done incorrectly. Tests failed or done poorly.\n\nKate is failing the class because Kate is failing the class.\n\nside note here. If, in the very unlikely chance that the teacher was so strict that a single misses lab was an automatic fail even for an A or B student, this is something that her mom could be fighting with the school and the district.\n\nAs for the consequence of \"failing a class means not sports participation\" (really likely, no organized extracuricular participation), what is so harsh about that? The point of going to school is to get an education.\n\nExtra-curiculars take time away from students availability for doing their school work. If a student is failing a class, then they should not be participating in sports and other stuff. They need that time for their studies.\n\nThe school can not force the student to spend their free time studying. But the school can, should and in this case is ensuring that they are not contributing to the student having less than the maximum amount of free time available to study, when that student is actively failing a class.\n\nI will also add that I would not think this consequence too harsh, even if this were the only class Kate is failing or has every failed. Even if she is a perfect straight A student otherwise, it does not change the fact that she is failing the class.", "Properly applied, the intent of such a rule should be to ensure that everyone that was **working** on doing the lab got the same measurements and data recorded. No matter which of you made the measurements or recorded the data first.\n\nExample, if you're doing a titration and you're the one running the titrate, your partner would typically be the one scribing the start and end volumes first. Then, when you record them yourself afterwards, you should be able to double-check that the numbers you wrote are the same as the numbers they wrote.\n\nIf anything, it's to prevent a spiteful lab partner from preventing you from verifying that your data matches.\n\nWhat it should not be getting used for is to facilitate a member of the group not even bothering to do the lab, and then come along afterwards to swoop up the data that others collected.\n\nKate may have been assigned as a member of your group but she was not actually participating as a member of your group.", "Okay but she walked away without your paper. Were you supposed to chase after her? Force your paper into her hand? The blame isn\u2019t on you. There is something called personal responsibility and it\u2019s her responsibility to make sure she gets the work done and that she passes her class. Her family situation and finances has nothing to do with you.

They were usually also responsible for running a different arm of the experiment and have to give you that data. So you have an obligation to provide the data to the rest of the group.", "All lab members are supposed to check in with each other to make sure they can get the lab turned in on time. It\u2019s a stupid rule and my teacher has never enforced it, but it does exist. I did not say anything to her directly either.", "I hear you, and yet agree to disagree. I hate that some kids have to consistently excel and make smart choices or they'll have no chance at an education, while others can mess up a bunch of times without repercussions cause their parents have money. It is insane for Kate's mom to blame OP for \"ruining her life\", and Kate has definitely not made smart choices, but an academic scholarship should never have been her only chance at an education in a just society.  \n\nBesides, as an educator, I do not think banning kids from extracurriculars helps them do better in their studies. Research has shown that extracurriculars like sports and drama actually have a positive effect on kids' academic performance, while punishing kids for bad grades just doesn't work.", "You gave her the data. She chose not to take it and complete her lab. Her being too dumb/lazy to succeed when you literally handed her the answers is not your fault.", "NTA. \n\nYou and the others were working, she was talking to her friends. \n\nYou offered her the data, she didn\u2019t take it. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t doing her part, that\u2019s why she failed. Her bigotry just makes it worse. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t deserve the scholarship.", "NTA.   She was so busy laughing at her friend\u2019s jibe that she walked off without the data.

To fail completely due to this one assignment probably means she had missed or failed enough previous work to put her in a dangerous position anyway, and this was just the final nail in her coffin. No teacher wants to fail an otherwise good student...", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she may have ended up failing the class anyway if one assignment was the difference.
