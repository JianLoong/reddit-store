Any gift should be appreciated. Also, $100 seems normal. When I got married that's the amount most people gave.", "The first wedding I went to as an independent adult (extended family), I called my parents and asked what is the expectation of a gift, how much did they usually give as a family. My dad would usually say don\u2019t worry I\u2019m giving enough for all of us still and my mom would say the amount. That taught me some foundations of gift giving. \n\nMy dad also always said, his amount varied by family. If he knew the soon to he married couple were starting off fresh with little to no financial support from family, he\u2019d always give more to cover the cost of the wedding, and it gave them a bit of a gift on top. If the couple was well off, he\u2019d cover the cost of the wedding. \n\nAt the end of the day, weddings aren\u2019t meant to be cash grabs, they\u2019re meant to be a celebration. Etiquette does mean a gift, however it doesn\u2019t mean a minimum amount to enter. NTA.", "Your friend is a fucken AH. I\u2019ve never been to a wedding where the bride and groom expect a gift from both the parents AND the children. Any gift should be appreciated and \u201cfriend\u201d should go touch grass outside.", "INFO: What does the invitation say? If you and your family were invited as a single unit (all under the same invite), then one gift is appropriate. If your grown children received separate invites, then they should have brought their own gift.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately it seems like his wedding was less about celebrating with loved ones and more about the presents.  \n\nI find it pretty strange that he must have a monetary figure which he thinks he's worth.  Maybe I'm undervaluing myself but I'd be pretty happy if someone spent $100 on me.  You're right to end the friendship because he's not worth another cent.", "Friend sounds selfish and wedding sounds like a gift grab. Nta", "You could have at least corrected your kid's poor etiquette and asked them to send something after the fact.", "Wow. Imagine if you guys were going to a 400 dollars event, and your gift was 300. Or if you were going to a cruise that costs more than a thousand, and the gift was 800? Would he still complain? \n\nWhere I live concerts can go up to 600 in local currency (half a minimum monthly wage). I just paid that to see a band I really like. But I would never give a gift more expensive than that, only if it was my brother. I don't understand the reasoning. You have to prioritize yourself, not his party.", "NTA\n\nA gift is a gift! Not a reimbursement for the food they gave you!", "NTA! We have become a culture of receiving things! Nobody asked them to have a big wedding! Also most people who get mad about the cost of a gift they get, usually are crappy gift givers themselves. Glad you called him out!", "NTA: I can not tell you the gift value per guest at my wedding. Nor would I carry that around. End the friendship. It isn't even worth a conversation. It was said. GOOD DAY.", "ESH\n\nYour friend was out of line for bringing up the amount of your gift. That was a terribly rude statement. He should have prescribed gratitude. \n\nIf your adult children did not realized they needed to bring a gift, they could have mailed one the next day. There is not a statue of limitations on gift giving. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve inadvertently left the card at home and sent it later.", "Your friend is tacky for making that comment. You\u2019re cheap because $100? For 5 people? Seriously? ESH", "ESH\n\nYou and your children sound really mean to me. I like to at least cover the cost of the reception with the value of a gift when  attending a wedding. And I am not wealthy.\n\nIt was rude of your friend to say what he did but I very much share his view. I would have had to bite my tongue not to say something. -\n\nYou are happy to spend money on yourself but not on your friend when FIVE of you are guests at  his wedding. I find it hard to believe that neither you nor your wife discussed presents with your children.", "Gifts are based on the value people put on them, not the dollar amount.\n\nMy Christmas gift to my friend last year was cooking lessons from me.  It's not because I don't have money for a real gift, I just know he loves when I cook, he always wants to learn how to cook, and usually it's just one recipe at a time.\n\nSo after Christmas, he picked a day, I bought all the ingredients and taught him how to make several dishes at my house.  two of those were also favorites of his girlfriend, who he made one of those for valentines day and she loved it.  then after, that we vacuum packed and split at the end of the night.\n\nHe loved the thought behind it and thought it was a lot more value than normal gifts.  Not to mention it also came with a bunch of food to put in the freezer.", "I try to avoid weddings precisely because these days the bride and groom only care about how much money they get from their guests. Its not actually a celebration anymore.", "Ehhh, I'm going to get down voted, but I'm leaning YTA.\n\nBefore anything else, you gift what you can afford first. If you're right on cash, it's the thought that counts.\n\nThat being said, there is social etiquette for these events. You basically try to cover the cost of your plate(s) plus a little extra for the couple. Your family of five gave $100, or like $20 each. That's very little, and it probably cost the couple anywhere from $500 - $2,000 for you all to be there.\n\nI also think it's ridiculous that your adult children showed up without a gift at all. People are going to say \"It's not about the gifts!!\", but I'd argue in this case that \"It's all about the NO gifts.\" A big social faux pas.\n\nIf all he said was \"I'm surprised you can afford that\" at your MMA ticket cost, it's not all that outlandish, IMO. Maybe something that should have been an inside-voice thought, but it would be a very obvious thought regardless. \n\nDo some googling about what the typical gifting etiquette is for your area, or what venue costs are. I think you'll be surprised.", "I'll tell you how it felt for your friend: you spend 120$ on a random sports show event and less than that on your friend's special day. Looked like his big and special day was less important/worthy for you than MMA. Think how you'd feel about it? It's not even about it you could afford it, especially going as a family of four adults. Your daughter forgot the gift and felt ok going empty handed too. She could at least get an online gift card. She didn't even put in the minimum effort and you didn't remind her to send the gift after the wedding either. I'm not surprised that a person you call a friend felt less than that after what had happened. Looks like you just can't care less even tho you call him your friend. I had people coming to my bday empty handed because I didn't want their unemployment and little money to be an excuse for not coming. But this situation really sucked. Think about it instead of looking for excuses.", "YTA $100 for a family of five is cheap AF. And if your kids forgot gifts, you should have told them to mail a check after the wedding.", "NAH. The comment section shows that people have different expectations regarding gifts at weddings.\n\nYou thought he should be happy with the gift you gave and your family's presence, while he felt insulted because it seemed like not much effort was put into the gift.\n\nIf it's a 20 year friendship that you want to keep, just buy him something extra and say it's from the family. Then call to apologize and explain. If he is understanding, he will probably apologize for being a dick and now it's water under the bridge.", "YTA if your grown daughters don\u2019t know they are supposed to buy a wedding gift than that is on you for not discussing it or teaching them manners & protocol ahead of time.  Most people would have suggested a family gift from the 5 of you or told them they needed to provide their own gifts.", "WTF.\n\nHe\u2019s a total AH\n\n1.  As a groomsman you already put time and money in without a gift\n2. A 100 is a big gift.  Better that than you all get 20 dollar items.  Gifts aren\u2019t even mandatory", "Yikes...what a waste of time.....\nYour ex- friend is the AH!!!!\nA greedy, judgmental,  ignorant AH!!\nHope you make better choices as to whom you let into your life!!", "Your friend was wrong to say what he did. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty lame, though, that your three grown daughters \u201cforgot\u201d to get a gift, the reason being they had never been to a wedding before. How in the world is that a reason? \n\nA gift of $100 from five adults is pretty cheap, especially considering one of them was a groomsman. As I said, I think your friend was wrong to say what he did. But I wouldn\u2019t blame him one bit for thinking it.

As a parent it's your job to teach your kids the \"protocol\" for weddings.", "I\u2019m torn between YTA and NAH. Your friend probably felt close enough to you to share his disappointment (and probably surprise) at the perceived lack of etiquette and respect. How he approached it may be another issue, but clearly you\u2019re close enough to talk about it. Weddings are tricky, but showing up empty handed as adults (your daughters) is usually not taken well, especially if paired with no card or well wishes. I think most people try to be understanding of smaller gifts or not count on/expect gifts, but traditionally, $100 for more than 2 people especially is not proper etiquette.", "Throw away 20 years over that kind of attitude?\n\n\nNot only are you NTA, he is TA, a TRBPA.\n(The really big petty AH)\n\nIt's a gift, not an obligation.\n\nYou didn't say if it was a first or second wedding. \nMaybe the new bride expected more? If it's the first, and this guy was an old friend, maybe the new wife is the variable that changed in your friendship with this dude. \n\nAt my second wedding I did not expect any gifts, I just wanted everyone I cared about with me. \n\nMy first wedding my ex expected gifts, and see how that worked out for me. \n\nYou should've tossed a 20 at him and said, there ya go, happy?  Then tell him to piss off", "Yta - you pay for your plate is the rule !", "NTA. If your \u201cfriend\u201d is upset because you didn\u2019t give him an expensive gift then he is not your friend.

Also being in the wedding party comes with expenses so yeah you gave him more.", "Wow, gift or not. They wanted the wedding its not up to the people invited to make up for the cost.

If he didn't like the gift the sensible thing to do would be to file it away for a future reciprocal gift giving situation, not be an AH about it.", "Wtf?

Because again - you should never *expect* a gift just because you invited someone to your wedding. No one is obligated to attend and no one is obligated to give a gift. I kept track of who gave me a gift so that I could send them a thank you card, but it's not like I cross-referenced it with the invite list to see who didn't give a gift.      \n\nIf you're that concerned about the wedding gifts, I worry about the future of the marriage.", "OP said they forgot, which means they knew.

It might also be something that this friend carries for a long time and might not even be aware of: when I was about 10 I got a watch for Xmas. This watch cost my mom $6. The same Xmas my step sister got a gift for over 100$. Imagine how I felt as a kid to see that she's worth more to the parents than me. I'm a few decades older now but it still feels crap when I think about it. Yes, the treatment was also different so it wasn't the case of the gift itself. But that's how I can easily imagine how his friend might feel. So I was just trying to show OP a different point of view. He might be way too harsh on that friend while he didn't teach his adult kids the customs and is defending them a month later. They had a month to send the gift if they simply forgot. You know, if there is a will, there is a way. \n\nPs. I'm not from the USA so we have a custom of gifting the value of what we call \"plate\". Let's say all the food for one person in the restaurant is priced at 50$, we give 50$ for each adult person. God parents and very close family usually give way more but it's not expected. It's just what we do. Also, nobody frowns if the guests can't afford that plate. Some people just bring a card and flowers. I think there is just way more understanding and that feeling of celebration with the people you love where I'm from.", "I'm sure you're speaking from experience. But I'm good. Will leave you to your fellow Montessori friends. Maybe you'll also learn to read with understanding since you don't get the part that I was just trying to explain to him how his friend could see it. Him not teaching ADULT kids the protocol and not correcting them afterwards is not good. But guess you can't comprehend that either. I rest my case.", "Probably because it was off the registry, right?", "some weddings will have a table at the entrance where guests will leave gifts. there is sometimes people there that will write that who gave what (usually so that they can return the favor in the future)", "If it\u2019s from the registry and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good gift that\u2019s so on him LOL"]}
