Literally, we shared a crib in daycare. When my now husband proposed 5 years ago, she was the very first person I called and immediately asked her to be my maid of honor. When I got the very first positive pregnancy test that ultimately ended in miscarriage I called her first both times. When I found out I was pregnant with my rainbow baby she was the very first person I told. And so on with the surprise pregnancy of my second daughter and her birth a year and a half later. We even asked her to be the girls \u201cfairy god mother\u201d. \n\nFlash forward to last summer, her boyfriend of 10 years calls me and asks me to show up for a surprise engagement party he had planned for her after he proposes. I literally jump through my ass to make it work so that I could be there. (I was literally 2 weeks from giving birth the second time and was technically on bed rest. Okay, so big deal.) After that it was radio silence from her. She didn\u2019t show up to my oldest daughters second birthday. (Huge deal because we had just gotten her autism diagnosis.)\n\nSide note: one of the only times that Emma spoke to me in that time frame between the proposal and my daughters birthday was to tell me that \u201cbecause she has a degree in psychology and knows better than me, she does not believe that my daughter has autism\u201d despite having SEVERAL specialists say otherwise. She has hardly spent 20 minutes with my daughter in the 2 years she has been alive.\nI only found out about the wedding 2 weeks ago when she posted it on Facebook along with her whole wedding party. All of her bridesmaids are skinny/blonde girls she met in college. I have a feeling she didn\u2019t want me in the wedding party because I am the opposite of this \u201caesthetic\u201d (i.e. dark brown hair and a little on the heavier side). \nThe other thing is that when I brought up my concern with her about coming with my autistic daughter she quote said to \u201cleave her in the car with your husband until the reception\u201d. I get being child free. BUT- This is your god daughter that you are telling to sit outside in the car. To me that is saying my family isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nI\u2019m so hurt by it all but I am not saying a word to her because I do not want to upset her before her big day. I honestly don\u2019t think I could sit through it and keep a straight face feeling this hurt. My parents think I am an ass hole for making the decision to not go and not confronting her about it ahead of time.

And I definitely wouldn\u2019t go once she said to leave your family in the car until the reception.  That\u2019s an awful thing to say.  Find adult friends who value your time.  Good luck.", "First your stories are all about she's the first person you got to but none of them are about how you are the first person she goes to .... See the difference. Sometimes the ppl you feel closest to do not feel the same way about you. Sure it could be that you don't fit the aesthetic or it could be that she just does not feel you are her closest friend.\n\nSecond, a child's second birthday is important to no one but the parents. Having an autism diagnosis does not change the fact that it's a party the child will not remember. \n\nFinally, what do you expect her to do to support your child attending the wedding. At that age there are not a lot of options. Toddlers are either able to attend events or they aren't. They are to old to sleep through and to young to reason with beforehand. It's really a case of some have the temperament to attend and others don't. I'm just not sure what response you expected, if your child can't manage the wedding - which she will be to young to remember - then the obvious solutions are either get a babysitter or have your husband stay with her. \n\nI'm getting the distinct feeling that you know she doesn't want to be as involved in your life as you want her to be and that you are hoping that by throwing curve balls like 'oh my daughter might not be able to attend' you can get her to validate the importance of your relationship and instead she's confirming what you already know deep down. \n\nIf she really means as much to you as you've mentioned then I agree with your parents, talk to her. However, be prepared for her to tell you that while your a good friend she also has other friends she just feels closer to at this stage of her life.", "Honestly all this \"literally\" and \"big deal\" and \"first to know\" seems clingy and I'm itchy thinking about it. Is everything a huge deal to you? \n\nIt sounds like she's drifted away and you just won't. NAH though. These things happen.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely normal for friendships to change or run their course in your early twenties. It sounds like you\u2019re in different stages of life, and are coping with the changes to your friendship in different ways. You\u2019re holding on to the friendship a bit too hard, and she\u2019s being a dick.\n\nThat being said, bridal party decisions are often more logical than emotional. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it sounds like you are living in geographically different places? You obviously have a lot on your plate, and her college friends might just be more available for the traditional bridesmaid stuff.\n\nPeople can set their own rules about children at weddings. Lots of couples have childfree ceremonies, or limits around age. Many couples only invite children who are direct relatives, members of the bridal party, or who are travelling long-distance without childcare. Sometimes the rules don\u2019t make sense to \u2018outsiders\u2019. Often these rules are enforced harshly, because once you make one exception, everyone expects an exception for their child.\n\nI would encourage you to make your own \u201cnew friends\u201d who\u2019s priorities and phase of life align more with your own (like she has with her college friends). You might benefit from joining parenting groups, and finding support there, rather than from your friends without children. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can make whatever decision you like about attending her wedding. However, your friendship will likely end for good if you don\u2019t attend.", "I understand that you are hurt not to be a bridesmaid, but frankly a mother with two small children could have a hard time with both the time and expenses that entails. I don\u2019t know if that was her reason, but it would be a concern.", "Choice to not go is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you're vastly overestimating your importance to her, though. If you did confront her, she would not be upset, now or later. So if you're going to confront her, do it when you feel ready, not her.", "I hate to tell you o.p. Your best friend has a best friend. But it isn't you. Find someone who makes you feel good about yourself.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, it sounds like this friendship has been one-sided for longer than you realise and while I think you\u2019re wrong for being upset about not being picked as a bridesmaid (for reasons I\u2019ll detail below), you\u2019re not an AH for not wanting to go to her wedding. As the old saying goes: it\u2019s an invitation, not a summons.\n\nYou have described many occasions where you have bent over backwards to be there for her and include her in your important life events, but mention nothing about her doing the same with you. You\u2019ve made her your daughter\u2019s \u2018fairy godmother\u2019 but she hasn\u2019t spent more than 20 minutes with her in two years, and barely spoke to you in that timeframe other than to tell you that she doesn\u2019t think your daughter actually has autism. Also, unless this is a last-minute arrangement (which it doesn\u2019t sound like it is), giving you an invitation two weeks away from her wedding tells me that you were on the reserve guest list and nowhere near a priority to her. \n\nSo yeah, nothing about her behaviour tells me that she even considers you a friend, let alone a \u2018best\u2019 friend and I think she\u2019s been trying to tell you this for some time. While I think you should\u2019ve noticed it (and acted upon it) a long time ago, I can\u2019t blame you for choosing to ignore the signals she was giving. It\u2019s incredibly hard to come to terms with the fact that a 20+ year friendship has changed and that you\u2019re basically trying to keep hold of nothing. Ask me how I know about that.\n\nI think the only thing you can do here is RSVP \u2018no\u2019, wish her well and let her go.

I think this friendship may have run it's course.", "NAH, but you are making her wedding about you and that's not OK. Clearly if your daughter had only spent 20 minutes with her at 2 years old she's not that involved in your daily life.

She may just be in a different phase of life so try not to take all of this so personally!", "Sometimes friendships run there course. It sometimes is just life taking you in different directions. Op she doesn't see you as her best friend you need to back away now and find new friends.  Wish her well for her wedding but leave this friendship in the past.", "Why do people assume they know more than trained medical professionals? Your friend is definitely an a hole for questioning your daughter's diagnosis. However, on the matter of her intentionally leaving you out might just be to logistical problems. Your friend might have not asked you to be a bridesmaid or maid of honor because she knew you were having a baby around the time she wanted to have the wedding. Plus, she probably knew you would be far along during the planing and the day of the wedding. So maybe she didn't want to put more stress on a new mom with a 2 year old also. Also a heavily pregnant woman is not going to be the best person to assist with setting up and breaking down a wedding. Also when it comes to a bachelorette party depending on the type it could be a judgey and awkward experience. If your friend wanted to got to bars or a strip club a pregnant woman would be pretty out of place. Many people will judge you or start a confrontation for being pregnant and in an area that serves alcohol even if you're not drinking. OP you also stated your due date is around the time of the wedding. So maybe your friend knew there was a chance of you giving birth near the wedding so she didn't want to put responsibilities of you in case you go into labor before or during the wedding. Also 2 year old are not know for behaving well at weddingd, so maybe she didn't want a young child to cry during the ceremony. Plus, your daughter has autism, so going to a wedding would likely be over stimulating for her and she would be more likely to have a breakdown from being overwhelmed by a bunch of different stimulus. Also parents are way more excited about their kids than the rest of the world. While you were picturing a close Aunt like bond with her and your daughter, she may have never had that intention. She is just your friend not your family or your daughter's friend. She doesn't really have an obligation to have that type of relationship with a friend's child. Plus you too are just at different stages in life. Your friend was focusing on building her life with her boyfriend, while you were past that and onto raising your child. It is also likely she became closer to her friends without children. A new parents entire life is their kids, so then tend to only talk about their kid or tend to shirt the conversation to when their friends are going to have kids too. While a childless couple can focus completely on them and she would also have more in common with the childless couples. It sounds like you too are just not friends anymore because life pushed you apart. So maybe talk to your friend about feeling hurt at not being included in the wedding party before jumping to conclusions. So I'm going with I can't make an unbiased opinion without knowing your friend's side of the story and why she didn't include you. OP you could have felt incredibly insecure and started to think the most catastrophic situations around the wedding planning. This could be from the mixture of the pain of grieving a friend plus pregnancy hormones.", "NTA but what does \"rainbow baby\" mean?", "NTA.

That is a choice she chooses to have and has every right to do so as it\u2019s her day. Even if you don\u2019t agree. Plus a childfree wedding is that for a reason and a child with autism would be a very big exception\u2026 as typically kids with autism could cause bigger issues (note I said TYPICALLY. This might not be the case with your kid. But sensory issues and crowds TYPICALLY are a bad combo for people with autism of any age. Coming from someone who worked with autistic kids specifically for 7 years). \n\nThat all being said, you are not the AH and can choose not to go, but it should be for all the other reasons.

I wouldn't give this friendship much more time or energy", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry but that girl is not your friend. I hope you don\u2019t let anyone else treat you that way. I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA.   \n\n\nBut I'm going to say as gently as I possibly can, this person likely doesn't view you in the same greatness of the relationship as you view them.

It\u2019s so, so hard to learn how to read that and I really wish we as a society would normalize just friggen telling people when we don\u2019t want to be \u201cbest friends\u201d anymore.

And I'm not saying this as though she's a bad kid or you're a bad parents. My nephew is autistic and lives with me at 19. And some of the behaviors he does he just can't help. So we don't go places where he may be triggered or may cause disruptive reactions from him because he doesn't like it anymore than the people around him likes it and he also finds it embarrassing. So if your child is someone who can't handle being around crowds and a formal situation like that quite yet then I don't see what the problem is with wait until the reception for your child to go. Besides actual wedding ceremonies are boring as hell. At least from what I recall as a child going to weddings. All the fun to be had was always at the reception.

But then, her opinion is that your daughter is neurotypical, or at least \"not autistic\".  So where is this coming from? Can your daughter sit calmly through the ceremony?  ie - is there any chance this is a reasonable request?  Either way, given her lack of relationship with your daughter, she's demonstrating there's no bond there.  And also she may be very bitchy and rude.  Just comes back to the comment above.  You may be her friend, but she's not yours.  \n\nI hope you send a nice gift and spend the day doing something that will mean more to your lives than this wedding.  \n\nPS;  I have a niece and nephew on the spectrum.
