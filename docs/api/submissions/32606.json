Her oldest is Kaia (13). Kaia has a different dad from the younger kids. My sister and her ex were together until Kaia was 2 and then they broke up (they were never married). Kaia's dad died 3 years ago.\n\nMy sister got married when Kaia was 5 and had her other children when Kaia was 7+. From day one Kaia called them half siblings. I'm not sure if my sister noticed less back then or if she was trying to wait it out for Kaia to drop the half. But in the last few months my sister has been on Kaia about saying half. She told her the kids are not half anything, they are siblings, they are full people and she shouldn't love them less because they have different bio fathers. She also told her Tom (her husband) has been an awesome second dad to her so she could look at it as they do share two parents, even if not two bio parents.\n\nA couple of weeks ago Kaia told her mom that half sibling is used all the time in school. She has friends who use it, teachers who use it, and she heard it from the time she started school and it's not weird. My sister told her it was categorically not true. She said half is used to divide and nobody in real life would use such a hurtful term.\n\nKaia told her to ask me since I'm a teacher and know if that's used among people her age and younger better she (my sister) does. So my sister asked me in front of Kaia and told me Kaia had told her kids use that term a lot and she doesn't believe it. I told her I did encounter half siblings being used in my classroom. I said I don't always know a student is blood related to their siblings or not or if their parents have kids from different relationships. But I always get around 3 to 6 kids a year who will say step and half. I also told her that normally continues when they go to high school. My husband teaches high school and he mentioned it to me when my sister and Kaia started fighting over her use of it.\n\nMy sister didn't like my response and told me I should have the common sense to back her up over Kaia when Kaia is present. She said I should not be backing Kaia up, but her. Because I should want this nipped in the bud as much as she does. I told her she's the one who asked me.

How are you saying something isn't categorically true and playing dumb, making statements that no one is half anything and we are all full human beings? There is nothing wrong with what your niece is saying because it is 100% the truth. Your sister is trying to force a nuclear family onto her family instead of embracing that her family structure is modern. I also think talking to Kaia about her stepfather in that way contradicts her whole statement. If she never realized Kaia said half siblings for years she wasn't present as a mother as she should have been, to begin with. Is your sister embarrassed about having multiple baby daddies or something? Good on you for being honest. Kaia is 13 and not stupid. Make sure you have your doors open for her communication-wise (could change to living-wise), as your sister sounds manipulative!", "NTA\n\nThere's no reason to lie here. Kaia asked you a reasonable question and you answered it honestly. Your sister can really want her children to never use the term half sibling but her insistence on it being verboten is out of line and probably counterproductive, she can't determine the relationship Kaia has with her (half) siblings.", "NTA.  I guess your sister thinks lying to her kid(s) to fit her own fantasy about FaMiLy is better than her kid(s) knowing about their own relationships in the world.\n\nEdit- it's ironic that she says you should use \"common sense\" when she clearly has none herself!", "NTA\n\nyou should tell your sister that by pushing this on Kaia she is aiming a nuke at the interpersonal family relationships. It never goes well when adults try to push familial bonds on kids before they are ready. \n\nAlso your sister is incredibly, mind-bogglingly naive if she thinks \"half-sibling\" is too hurtful to be said by people.....", "NTA, your sister has a hell of a definition of common sense. Thank you for being honest! As niece\u2019s dad passed away, she may be using \u201chalf\u201d as a way to remember him and that HE was her dad, not step-dad. She CAN have two dads, but that is for her to decide.", "NTA - it's your sister who has certain feelings about the word. The word is correct.\n\nYour sister is somehow looking at it negatively (like half a person) when that's not what it means at all...it's just a description or category that more accurately describes the sibling.  The question appears to be though, how she treats her half-siblings.  I have a half-sister and step siblings too. to describe or introduce them to others, I will use 'sister' if it's casual and doesn't really matter, but for people who know me, I will specify half or step because the story happens (either they know me and will ask 'I didn't know you had a sister', or I will then explain 'this is mom and John's daughter'), etc.\n\nSo as long as Kaia isn't shoving it in her sibling's faces and always saying 'half' as a negative term, then she's totally correct and your sister needs to focus less on the word and more on the people.", "NTA\n\nYou were giving an honest answer.  \n\nYour sister is delusional if she thinks she is going to change a 13 YO's position on her relationships with her step parents and half sibling at this late date.  \n\nShe should focus on just making them get along and be as close as comfortable.  This IS her family, the way it is.", "NTA\n\nI have an older \"half\"-sister (different father), but I personally don't use the term (she might, but we haven't had any contact in maybe 5 years).

They're my children just as much as my son is (from a previous relationship) & my older sister is my sister just as much as my younger siblings. I just don't make those distinctions.\n\nThat said, I can certainly understand those who DO make those distinctions. It's whatever people feel comfortable with & referring to half-/step-siblings as such is certainly not outside the norm.", "NTA You know your niece isn't lying.

Most of the time, I will say \u201cmy sister\u201d or \u201cmy brother\u201d when talking about my siblings, but (in high school especially) I always tend to clarify because my half and step siblings are 6+ years older than me. My friends in high school knew my brother (full brother). I would say something about my sister and my friends would be like \u201cyou have a sister?!\u201d (Yes. 6).

The older of the two went off on his friend one time when he called my daughter his half-sister.  He said she was his whole sister and felt it was insulting to say otherwise.  It feels very divisive and offensive to us, but every family is different and people just have to accept the terms others feel comfortable with.", "NTA. She's literally asking you to gaslight your niece.

We got into it a few years ago because she was unhappy that Kaia was calling her husband Tom and I told her it should be okay.", "Exactly! Kaia is at the age where developing personal identity is very important, and to her, having a dad who has passed and a blended family is an important part of her story. Trying to erase that could feel like erasing a part of her identity. \"Half\" does not have to have a negative connotation, and it seems like if it does in this instance, that is coming from your sister and not Kaia.\n\nNTA.

The way it was explained to me the term half-sibling is factual. It means the siblings share one parent. The same as saying 'first cousin' meaning you share a grandparent or 'second cousin' meaning you share a great-grandparent. I think it gets iffy when someone says 'half-sister' or 'half-brother'. Now we are no longer talking about biology but relationships. For example, my father has several half-siblings, but they are all his sisters and brothers.

Your sister is one of those ridiculous people who pushes the notion of united blended family even when it's crystal clear that the children involved are not pleased, not bonding as dreamed and likely never will. She further pisses in the punch trying to convince Kaia to think of her step dad as a replacement for her bio dad who by all accounts she had a loving relationship with and misses him.
