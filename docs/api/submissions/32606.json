Her oldest is Kaia (13). Kaia has a different dad from the younger kids. My sister and her ex were together until Kaia was 2 and then they broke up (they were never married). Kaia's dad died 3 years ago.\n\nMy sister got married when Kaia was 5 and had her other children when Kaia was 7+. From day one Kaia called them half siblings. I'm not sure if my sister noticed less back then or if she was trying to wait it out for Kaia to drop the half. But in the last few months my sister has been on Kaia about saying half. She told her the kids are not half anything, they are siblings, they are full people and she shouldn't love them less because they have different bio fathers. She also told her Tom (her husband) has been an awesome second dad to her so she could look at it as they do share two parents, even if not two bio parents.\n\nA couple of weeks ago Kaia told her mom that half sibling is used all the time in school. She has friends who use it, teachers who use it, and she heard it from the time she started school and it's not weird. My sister told her it was categorically not true. She said half is used to divide and nobody in real life would use such a hurtful term.\n\nKaia told her to ask me since I'm a teacher and know if that's used among people her age and younger better she (my sister) does. So my sister asked me in front of Kaia and told me Kaia had told her kids use that term a lot and she doesn't believe it. I told her I did encounter half siblings being used in my classroom. I said I don't always know a student is blood related to their siblings or not or if their parents have kids from different relationships. But I always get around 3 to 6 kids a year who will say step and half. I also told her that normally continues when they go to high school. My husband teaches high school and he mentioned it to me when my sister and Kaia started fighting over her use of it.\n\nMy sister didn't like my response and told me I should have the common sense to back her up over Kaia when Kaia is present. She said I should not be backing Kaia up, but her. Because I should want this nipped in the bud as much as she does. I told her she's the one who asked me. She said again that I should have used common sense.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702050648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dpq55/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_hear_the_term_half/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister shouldn't ask questions she doesn't want the answer to. I believe that the increased public use of half- and step- actually shows how society is starting to normalize blended families.

What happened there???\", it's just part of who they are to each other, and no one else really cares.

Good on you for being honest and trying to use your experience to reduce your sister's misconceptions.", "I'm not sure what sister is upset about.

NTA, your sister sounds idiotic.", "NTA. Saying her siblings are half-siblings is a technically correct term for what they are. That doesn't mean they aren't also siblings, but that Kaia recognizes they are are from a different father and only half blood related. Kaia's biological father was alive until she was 10 and, assuming he was a part of her life but not inescapable even if he wasn't, she's allowed to feel and acknowledge that separation.

How are you saying something isn't categorically true and playing dumb, making statements that no one is half anything and we are all full human beings? There is nothing wrong with what your niece is saying because it is 100% the truth. Your sister is trying to force a nuclear family onto her family instead of embracing that her family structure is modern. I also think talking to Kaia about her stepfather in that way contradicts her whole statement. If she never realized Kaia said half siblings for years she wasn't present as a mother as she should have been, to begin with. Is your sister embarrassed about having multiple baby daddies or something? Good on you for being honest. Kaia is 13 and not stupid. Make sure you have your doors open for her communication-wise (could change to living-wise), as your sister sounds manipulative!", "NTA\n\nThere's no reason to lie here. Kaia asked you a reasonable question and you answered it honestly. Your sister can really want her children to never use the term half sibling but her insistence on it being verboten is out of line and probably counterproductive, she can't determine the relationship Kaia has with her (half) siblings.", "NTA.  I guess your sister thinks lying to her kid(s) to fit her own fantasy about FaMiLy is better than her kid(s) knowing about their own relationships in the world.\n\nEdit- it's ironic that she says you should use \"common sense\" when she clearly has none herself!", "NTA\n\nyou should tell your sister that by pushing this on Kaia she is aiming a nuke at the interpersonal family relationships. It never goes well when adults try to push familial bonds on kids before they are ready. \n\nAlso your sister is incredibly, mind-bogglingly naive if she thinks \"half-sibling\" is too hurtful to be said by people.....", "NTA, your sister has a hell of a definition of common sense. Thank you for being honest! As niece\u2019s dad passed away, she may be using \u201chalf\u201d as a way to remember him and that HE was her dad, not step-dad. She CAN have two dads, but that is for her to decide.", "NTA - it's your sister who has certain feelings about the word. The word is correct.\n\nYour sister is somehow looking at it negatively (like half a person) when that's not what it means at all...it's just a description or category that more accurately describes the sibling.  The question appears to be though, how she treats her half-siblings.  I have a half-sister and step siblings too. to describe or introduce them to others, I will use 'sister' if it's casual and doesn't really matter, but for people who know me, I will specify half or step because the story happens (either they know me and will ask 'I didn't know you had a sister', or I will then explain 'this is mom and John's daughter'), etc.\n\nSo as long as Kaia isn't shoving it in her sibling's faces and always saying 'half' as a negative term, then she's totally correct and your sister needs to focus less on the word and more on the people.", "NTA\n\nYou were giving an honest answer.  \n\nYour sister is delusional if she thinks she is going to change a 13 YO's position on her relationships with her step parents and half sibling at this late date.  \n\nShe should focus on just making them get along and be as close as comfortable.  This IS her family, the way it is.", "NTA\n\nI have an older \"half\"-sister (different father), but I personally don't use the term (she might, but we haven't had any contact in maybe 5 years). My 3 oldest children are \"step\"-children. The only time I ever use that term is when I have to explain how I have a 41-year-old daughter (I'm 53) & a 6'3\" son (I'm 5'8\" on a GOOD day). They're my children just as much as my son is (from a previous relationship) & my older sister is my sister just as much as my younger siblings. I just don't make those distinctions.\n\nThat said, I can certainly understand those who DO make those distinctions. It's whatever people feel comfortable with & referring to half-/step-siblings as such is certainly not outside the norm.", "NTA You know your niece isn't lying. You should not negate her truth by lying to her to make your sister happy. \n\nYour sister is being stubborn and making something out of nothing. The more she harps on it, the more it's going to be a thing. Good luck to her undoing the thing now.\n\nAnd the truth is, they are her half siblings. No that doesn't mean she loves them less, it's just the honest answer when describing her family history to people.", "NTA\n\nCommon sense is being honest. Kaia is too old to be lied to.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s reaction to Kaia using the term \u201chalf-sister\u201d or \u201chalf-brother\u201d is unreasonable and she\u2019s making it into more of a big deal than it needs to be. Kaia and her siblings don\u2019t share the same dad so yes, they are half-siblings. IMO unless her half-siblings have a problem with it then mom needs to let this go.

Is that what she calls wanting you to lie?  Your sister is being crazy.  I have half and step siblings, and yes, I do refer to them that way.

She'd rather you lie to your niece then tell the truth just so her way can be \"right\". That is so immature and pushy, yet she acts like your niece is the being like this when its her.

I have\u20264 half siblings and 5 stepsiblings. And one sibling that\u2019s my full sibling. Half is a descriptor. It only divides if you let it divide. Most of the time, I will say \u201cmy sister\u201d or \u201cmy brother\u201d when talking about my siblings, but (in high school especially) I always tend to clarify because my half and step siblings are 6+ years older than me. My friends in high school knew my brother (full brother). I would say something about my sister and my friends would be like \u201cyou have a sister?!\u201d (Yes. 6). Or I\u2019d mention my brother (half brother who is vastly different from my full brother) and they\u2019d get confused because what I just said didn\u2019t line up with the brother they knew. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for her to not feel that connection of \u201csibling\u201d with her younger half-siblings, especially since they\u2019re so much younger. Your sister needs to chill.", "NTA Your sister is lying to her daughter and trying to convince her of a negative connotation that only she seems to be holding onto. Half and step are both just descriptive language.", "NTA and I think the phrasing really just depends on the relationship between siblings.  I have a 5 year old, and her dad has two older boys. The older of the two went off on his friend one time when he called my daughter his half-sister.  He said she was his whole sister and felt it was insulting to say otherwise.  It feels very divisive and offensive to us, but every family is different and people just have to accept the terms others feel comfortable with.", "NTA. She's literally asking you to gaslight your niece. Expecting you to back her ridiculous lie and pretend nobody ever says what Kaia has heard people saying is asking you to try and convince Kaia that her perception of reality is wrong. It would be extremely abusive if it had any chance of being convincing. Thankfully there's no way that such a clumsy lie is going to make Kaia doubt what she knows it's true, so I am just baffled and have no idea what your sister hoped it would achieve.", "She is very firmly rooted in this and I do not think me offering her that explanation would go over well. We got into it a few years ago because she was unhappy that Kaia was calling her husband Tom and I told her it should be okay.", "Exactly! Kaia is at the age where developing personal identity is very important, and to her, having a dad who has passed and a blended family is an important part of her story. Trying to erase that could feel like erasing a part of her identity. \"Half\" does not have to have a negative connotation, and it seems like if it does in this instance, that is coming from your sister and not Kaia.\n\nNTA. Also, was your sister being manipulative by trying to convince Kaia half-siblings didn't exist as a term? It's not new and unless there is a language barrier, I am shocked that an adult with multiple children hasn't heard it before.", "She wants Kaia to believe that it's the wrong way to talk about siblings and that distinguishing between step, half and full is wrong, etc.", "She doesn't like having a blended family. She wants them to all be just a family.

When she asked you, she was just looking for her own personal echo chamber.", "So, she wanted you to destroy your relationship with your neice by calling her a liar? How shitty is that?\n\nI think a lot of kids say half sibling because they want to honor their other parent, alive or deceased. By pushing this, it's like your sister is trying to erase Kaia's dad.", "She wants Kia to believe that Kia's friend's and Kia's teacher's descriptive use of the term is wrong.

She is defining a relationship that isd less than you excpect out of a sibling thats why", "He feels the same as my sister. But he's afraid of pushing Kaia away more by bringing it up to her. He told me once he feels like she sees him as more of some random member of the family and not a close family member. I don't think he's wrong about that. But I also think if he pushes for what he wants it will push her away."]}
