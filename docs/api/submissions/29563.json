For my girlfriend\u2019s birthday, she was throwing a little party. She invited her best friend (F20), who we\u2019ll call Eve, to come down earlier so they could hang out before the party, since they haven\u2019t seen each other in 2 years because they go to different universities. They invited me to come eat lunch with them to meet Eve in person.\r  \n\r  \nBefore lunch, I invited my girlfriend and Eve over, and I have a wall where I have taped A LOT of pokemon cards to it. I called it my \u201cpokemon wall\u201d and she took a picture of it and laughed, and sent it to her boyfriend because he loves pokemon too. The lunch went well, and I am being my normal self. Which is very \u201costentatious and blunt\u201d. However, I made the fatal mistake of asking Eve what her major is and she replied back \u201cpsychology\u201d, and I have a very negative opinion about Psychology. All I said was, \u201cEhh psychology. That\u2019s a fake science.\u201d and my girlfriend said, \u201cYeah he doesn\u2019t like psychology.\u201d Nothing more, nothing less.\r  \n\r  \nLater that evening was the party, and Eve wasn\u2019t there. Supposedly she didn\u2019t want to come, and just wanted to go back home.\r  \n\r  \nThe next morning, my girlfriend called me asking if I could come over, and she showed me Eve\u2019s finsta. On Eve\u2019s finsta, she had posted two posts and three stories dogging on me. Saying how dare I be a misogynist and try to control her life by saying psychology is a fake science, that all I am is a toxic man, that I talk weird and need to learn how to talk properly (I have a speech impediment and accent), the Pokemon wall was ugly, and that biology (my major) is a fake science since everything in biology is theories. All of her friends commenting that I am some evil man. I wanted to fire back, but didn\u2019t because I did not want to damage my girlfriend\u2019s relationship with Eve. Plus I did not want to feed her narrative that I am a misogynist. Therefore, I pushed it to the side and forgot about it.\r  \n\r  \nAbout a week later, my girlfriend received PARAGRAPH texts from Eve stating how she still hates me and is now mad at my girlfriend for taking my side and not reprimanding me. She was saying how I was rude and laughed at her at lunch. Along with more jabs at me on a personal level, and Eve said that I only said psychology was fake to start a debate. Which isn\u2019t true at all, although I did debate all throughout highschool. My girlfriend replied back saying she didn\u2019t like how Eve posted about me on social media for all their friends to see. Eve replied saying how she\u2019s disappointed in my girlfriend, more mean things about me, and that she is pissed off.\r  \n\r  \nAbout a few days ago, Eve blocked my girlfriend on her finsta and lost her streak on snapchat. It\u2019s obvious that she is still mad at me for my opinions, and now posting trash posts about my girlfriend on her finsta. AITA for being blunt and causing all of this? Or is all of this petty drama?\r", "created_utc": 1698120214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f4078/aita_for_causing_my_girlfriend_and_her_best/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, the main reason being is my personality. There was some information I left out since it had to be less than 3000 characters; such as, asking \"Eve\" is she was okay since she kept spacing out during the lunch. In which she mentioned to my girlfriend that it was rude of me to do. Plus, my bluntness has caused me to lose a lot of friends. Thus, I thought it was about time to see if I am the person who is causes the break up amoungst friends or if it is them not accepting my personality. Additionally, I feel really bad about the whole situation I mentioned in the story since my girlfriend and \"Eve\" were really close, and I am the reason they don't talk anymore. It's a whole convulated mess, and I need advice. (I've already asked my male bestfriend for advice and he said to just breakup with my girlfriend haha).\n\nIn summary, I wanted to see if \"Eve\"'s actions to my bluntness was justified thus making me the asshole, or if everything was blown out of proportions.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Which is very \u201costentatious and blunt\u201d.\n\nThat's just code for being an unmitigated asshole. Not everything is a debate. How many more friends are you willing to lose before you wise up and see that the problem is YOU? Ok, so you don't believe in psychology, why belittle it by calling it junk science? Psychology is recognized as a social science and is included on the National Science Foundation's roster of recognized STEM disciplines\n\nYou couldn't ask Eve about her classes or what drew her to the subject? You couldn't ask if she had a minor? You just went in and attacked her area of study? First introduction and you pull this? \n\nEve's reaction does seemed a bit scorched Earth, however we weren't there so we just have to take your word for it. You cost your girlfriend a friend, how long until you cost yourself a girlfriend?", "YTA\n\nShe literally just said, \u201cI\u2019m majoring in psychology\u201d and you suddenly just shit all over her major. \n\nAnd for NO reason. She wasn\u2019t arguing she was a hard science major, so she\u2019s not threatening your egotistical claim to be the only **REAL** scientist. What a total dick move!\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be honest, math, physics, and even chemistry view biology the same way you view psychology so you can get off your high horse and stop thinking your better than other simply because of your major.\n\n>AITA for being blunt\u2026\n\nNo, you\u2019re the AH for insulting your gf\u2019s friend major for no reason and hiding behind the stupid \u2018I was just being honest/blunt\u2019 excuse when, in reality, you were just being a socially inept, embarrassing AH.", "YTA. Just because you have an opinion doesn't mean you have to voice it. Her major is (atm) her life choice and you just told her her life choice is fake and your her best friend tried to laugh it awaybwhich obviously hurt her deeply.", "YTA - Claiming to be blunt isn't an excuse to be rude. I've often found people who claim they are brutally honest, or \"blunt\" use it as a shield to make mean comments. You owe the friend an apology.", "YTA. And you're completely wrong about psychology, too.\n\nEDIT: I'll elaborate. It would have cost you nothing to keep your mouth shut. What has opening it cost? \n\nAlso, congrats! At the tender age of 21, you have decided that a field of study that is over 150 years old is \"fake\" and pissed all over someone else's aspirations in the process.", "Sounds like you need some therapy from a qualified psychologist bro. You seem to have some serious negative personality traits", "YTA you started drama and now want to come here and act the victim. Your girlfriend laughing when you are condescending to her friend you had just met also deserves some of the drama. She really went scorched earth on you though, if only there was a science that could explain her behavior \ud83e\udd14", "ESH (edit: well, you and Eve - your gf is stuck in the middle of two assholes like some kind of double-ended dildo of shit). You're both behaving like children. \n\nAlso \"ostentatious and blunt\"  is not a personality. Those are awkward character traits, not something to define yourself by.  If you can summarise your personality in 2 words you need more personality.\n\nIf you keep alienating people ask yourself why you allow your behaviour to keep doing that. Is telling someone that you have some daft internet meme-worthy opinion more important than shielding those around you who you care for from your same daft opinion? Not everyone needs to know your every thought, especially when you know that opinion is only going to cause conflict with someone who you are just meeting and is clearly important to your partner.\n\nEve needs to grow up and communicate like an adult.", "ESH, but my dude. You're just rude, you're not ostentatious and blunt. I don't blame her for being hurt.", "YTA. I feel like theres a LOT being left out, her reaction is very extreme, if all you did was call psychology a 'fake psychology.' she even avoided her best friends bday party because of you. I think youre probably lacking in self-awareness, so theres a lot you probably didnt pick up on in the interaction. You should have a conversation with your gf about this. Eve is her best friend, they have presumably helped eachother thru many hard times, its an important relationship to your gf. You should do your best to help her maintain it.", "YTA. \n\nGod, I have two degrees in social sciences and I deal with idiots like you all the time. Social sciences are increasingly quantitatively driven. The standards for sample size, reduction of bias, the strength of your models - all of it has to be pretty top notch these days. There is a ton of very real data behind social sciences. \n\nIt\u2019s not as \u201cperfect\u201d of a science as most STEM fields, because there\u2019s a lot more gray area. But that doesn\u2019t make it fake or the people who study it less intelligent.\n\nBut even if I can\u2019t convince you of any of that, you shouldn\u2019t say that to anyone. Some opinions are best kept to ourselves. That\u2019s a really rude and pretentious thing to say to someone, you diminished her goals and academic achievements. She didn\u2019t ask your opinion. That\u2019s a terrible way to treat your partner\u2019s friend, and you deserve her ripping you to shreds on her social media. \n\nYour GF sucks because yeah, she should\u2019ve read you the riot act for being such a tool to her friend. I would stop being friends with someone if they let their partner talk to me like that too.", "\"Ostentatious and blunt\" is code for \"I am only being honest but actually I'm being a total helmet\".\n\nYTA.\n\nYou insulted Eve's education and possible future career.   But you were only being you,  right?   Please take a long,  hard,  look at yourself and your behaviour.   I am not condoning Eve's behaviour towards your gf.  But to you?   You deserved it and more.", "ESH\n\nYou - for rendering an opinion that\u2019s both ~~blunt~~ uneducated and ignorant. You clearly need to learn about social cues, and an inability to do so  can in fact be indicative of a *psychological* disorder\u2026 or you might just be an AH.\n\nEve - for what she did on whatever finsta is.", "YTA, as you implicitly admitted yourself. \n\nI mourn for your gf who made the most wrong choice  (albeit she is at least partly at fault too, because it was a conscious choice) by choosing to ignore the wake up call of her best friend and side with you: this is a classic for people who have toxic partners and end up isolating themselves. she will be alone in the end.", "ESH, and you really walked right into this drama. Maybe take a step back and use some empathy or, I don't know, some \"psychology\" to see things from her perspective a little. It will go a long way toward understanding why she is reacting the way she is. She's clearly a drama queen, but you haven't even apologized to her yet, which for some reason you can't see is making things worse for your girlfriend.", "So at the grand old age of 21, you can support your argument that psychology is a \u201cfake science\u201d? Explain your position using your Pok\u00e9mon cards. Please, Golden Child, amaze us with your wisdom. \n\nESH You reek of AH with your arrogance. You meet your GF\u2019s best friend on your GF\u2019s birthday and proceed to belittle her. Don\u2019t give me any crap that you criticized psychology, not her. You were putting her down by putting her choice down, Pikachu. \n\nWhile Eve has just cause to be mad at you, she\u2019s clearly disturbed to be attacking both you and your GF on social media.", "Yeah, she might have overreacted, but\u2026.\n\nYou have exactly the behavior one would expect from someone who thinks psychology is fake science.\n\n\u201cOstentatious and blunt\u201d is just code for someone being unapologetically rude. \n\nYour fatal mistake wasn\u2019t asking her what her major was. It was opening your big mouth after to insult it. A wiser person would know better than to do that. It\u2019s hurtful, and there\u2019s no point to it. \n\nESH", "ESH. But you started it. Learn some social awareness. I'm 'brutally honest' and 'blunt' is just asshole speak for 'inconsiderate and socially incompetent.'", "\u201cOstentatious and blunt\u201d is just code for massive AH. You\u2019re not fooling anyone. \n\nESH", "ESH It sounds like she overreacted, but it also seems like you\u2019re not very socially adjusted. \n\nI have a little more respect for psychology now, but I\u2019ve also always viewed it as a very soft science, especially at your age. At the time, I probably also would have been blunt and said as much. However, I\u2019m slightly less socially inept now, and at this point it seems very obvious to me that you shouldn\u2019t insult something that someone wants to dedicate their life to unless you want to upset them. This seems especially autistic to do with your SO\u2019s best friend that you\u2019re just meeting.", "ESH - She overreacted, and I think you need to speak to a fake science *(really, dude?)* psychologist about your rudeness, or what you call your \"bluntness.\"", "YTA for asking her her major and then crapping on it. Also like said before when people say blunt it\u2019s usually means \u201cI\u2019m rude but it should be socially acceptable. \n\nHowever, sounds like Eve definitely over reacted and ultimately she is responsible for her friendship ending. Crapping on your speech impediment and public dragging you through the mud is 100% unacceptable. She caused the problems with her and your girlfriend, but you caused a problem with her. It\u2019s like a chain reaction of one upping you being an asshole by being a bigger asshole.", "now who is gonna tell him?", "ESH\n\nBut, OP, you're the biggest AH here. Psychology IS a Science, as much as Biology and Physics. There are actual experiments and theories that are tested before anything is ever discussed. There's nothing in the Science of Psychology that's based on guesswork and I think you need to read a bit more before being an ostentatious prick (nicest I can be). Psychologists have been dealing with bullc#@p like this for the last 100 years. I know, because I did (still do) as well when I studied it at University.\n\nYou devalued her studies/focus and think that you're just being yourself. Yes, that \"yourself\" is an AH.

Her friend (and circle beyond) is one for how childish the reaction was to your comment.", "My undergrad is in Human Biology - a hard/natural science, my post grad is in Psychology - a soft/social science, so this  \"fake science\" argument is laughable to me. A lot of the mathematics and statistical knowledge I gained in my Bachelors was useful for the crossover in my Masters. You don't appear knowledgeable enough to make comparisons.", "ESH except your gf. Both you and Eva are AH. Your opinion of psychology is childish, and her actions are even more ridiculous. Your gf should find another people to hang out with.", "ESH, Eve sucks more for slandering you all over the place. \n\nBut you *did* start it, don\u2019t ask questions if you plan on insulting the person for their answer and then be surprised when they get offended. Also, psychology plays a major role in law enforcement, and medical practice so it\u2019s not exactly a fake science.", "YTA \n\nYou called her major a fake science, just basically disregarding any and all work she\u2019s done for it and your excuse is well I\u2019m a blunt person?\n\nBlunt or not you don\u2019t get to just crap on people and shrug and say that\u2019s just who I am\n\nYou said you\u2019ve already lost friendships because you act like this and now you cost your girlfriend one as well.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Eves response to this has been great by any means but that doesn\u2019t excuse how you treat people", "ESH, apart from maybe your gf. Eve sucks for dragging her on social media and you suck for being insensitive and arrogant. Psychology may be a social science, but it isn't worthless, which is probably how you made Eve feel when you reacted with such a dismissive attitude to the subject she's majoring in. I majored in physics, but I wouldn't scoff at someone for taking biology just because I secretly consider it a soft science. There's this little thing called tact and I highly recommend you learn how to use it.", "Loves the sound of their own voice, over confident in their \"opinions\" and talks to people like shit because they don't \"suffer fools\" or in other words, ostentatious and blunt. Yeah YTA, stop acting like a w@nker before you find yourself isolated, alone and friendless", "YTA\n\nIt would have been so easy to keep your opinion to yourself but nope, you're \"ostentatious and blunt\".

This whole thing was dramatic AF and unnecessary. You didn't HAVE to state that you think psychology is fake to someone literally studying it. And also WTF.... psychology is not *at all* fake. Eve's response was kind of a lot, but I don't blame her for feeling bad about you, and trying to play \"biology is fake\" which is also not true to attempt to highlight the ridiculousness of your assertion.

Why do you think it's ok to insult people? If you think psychology is a \"fake science,\" you keep that to yourself. You were extremely rude. To your new girlfriend's close friend. You should care about treating people with kindness and respect. Claiming you have a \"blunt personality\" is not an excuse to be an asshole all the time. In fact, that's literally what it means. \"That's just my personality\" is code for \"I don't think I should have to treat other people with respect.\"\n\nEve needs to learn how to not let rude comments get to her.

For my girlfriend\u2019s birthday, she was throwing a little party. She invited her best friend (F20), who we\u2019ll call Eve, to come down earlier so they could hang out before the party, since they haven\u2019t seen each other in 2 years because they go to different universities. They invited me to come eat lunch with them to meet Eve in person.\r  \n\r  \nBefore lunch, I invited my girlfriend and Eve over, and I have a wall where I have taped A LOT of pokemon cards to it. I called it my \u201cpokemon wall\u201d and she took a picture of it and laughed, and sent it to her boyfriend because he loves pokemon too. The lunch went well, and I am being my normal self. Which is very \u201costentatious and blunt\u201d. However, I made the fatal mistake of asking Eve what her major is and she replied back \u201cpsychology\u201d, and I have a very negative opinion about Psychology. All I said was, \u201cEhh psychology. That\u2019s a fake science.\u201d and my girlfriend said, \u201cYeah he doesn\u2019t like psychology.\u201d Nothing more, nothing less.\r  \n\r  \nLater that evening was the party, and Eve wasn\u2019t there. Supposedly she didn\u2019t want to come, and just wanted to go back home.\r  \n\r  \nThe next morning, my girlfriend called me asking if I could come over, and she showed me Eve\u2019s finsta. On Eve\u2019s finsta, she had posted two posts and three stories dogging on me. Saying how dare I be a misogynist and try to control her life by saying psychology is a fake science, that all I am is a toxic man, that I talk weird and need to learn how to talk properly (I have a speech impediment and accent), the Pokemon wall was ugly, and that biology (my major) is a fake science since everything in biology is theories. All of her friends commenting that I am some evil man. I wanted to fire back, but didn\u2019t because I did not want to damage my girlfriend\u2019s relationship with Eve. Plus I did not want to feed her narrative that I am a misogynist. Therefore, I pushed it to the side and forgot about it.\r  \n\r  \nAbout a week later, my girlfriend received PARAGRAPH texts from Eve stating how she still hates me and is now mad at my girlfriend for taking my side and not reprimanding me. She was saying how I was rude and laughed at her at lunch. Along with more jabs at me on a personal level, and Eve said that I only said psychology was fake to start a debate.
