She's also very \"open\", I suppose. \n\nThe incident that caused this was a recent trip we took over easter - she brought her life long best friend (whose mom is very hippie and I believe where she got the ideals from). Anyway, on our drive over, my daughters period started.\n\nShe was laughing about it with her friends and we pulled over to buy her some sanitary products, at which point, *in the store*, my daughter proclaimed \"I can literally feel it falling out of my vagina.\"\n\nI was humiliated. Her and her friend giggled over it, and if it weren't for the risk to my seats I probably would have walked out and had her wait until the next stop. In the car I had a strong word with her about her behaviour, at which point my wife told me I was being too much and to leave her alone - she was just being an immature teen.\n\nI still didn't think it was appropriate, but left it. Over our vacation she continued to make comments. Her friend also came on her period and then there was several hours of blaming her for pulling her cycle off (?).\n\nOverall it was uncomfortable and when we came home I told my daughter I did not appreciate her ruining my vacation with her period talk. She told me to lighten up, and if I couldn't handle having a daughter I should have used a condom. She brings that up often, which also grates on my nerves.\n\nUltimately I left it as neither of us were backing down and I try to keep a calm home, but my wife can tell I'm still upset and is telling me I'm acting like the immature teen now. She's a teen girl and in the first generation fully able to be open about things that were previously unspoken.\n\nI understand where shes coming from, but I am still allowed to be uncomfortable and not want to hear about it. If she wants to talk about her period with her friend, go ahead, but in private. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682108050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ugrjm/aita_for_complaining_about_my_daughters_period/", "score": 1076, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As are all her friends. She's also very \"open\", I suppose. \n\nThe incident that caused this was a recent trip we took over easter - she brought her life long best friend (whose mom is very hippie and I believe where she got the ideals from). Anyway, on our drive over, my daughters period started.\n\nShe was laughing about it with her friends and we pulled over to buy her some sanitary products, at which point, *in the store*, my daughter proclaimed \"I can literally feel it falling out of my vagina.\"\n\nI was humiliated. Her and her friend giggled over it, and if it weren't for the risk to my seats I probably would have walked out and had her wait until the next stop. In the car I had a strong word with her about her behaviour, at which point my wife told me I was being too much and to leave her alone - she was just being an immature teen.\n\nI still didn't think it was appropriate, but left it. Over our vacation she continued to make comments. Her friend also came on her period and then there was several hours of blaming her for pulling her cycle off (?).\n\nOverall it was uncomfortable and when we came home I told my daughter I did not appreciate her ruining my vacation with her period talk. She told me to lighten up, and if I couldn't handle having a daughter I should have used a condom. She brings that up often, which also grates on my nerves.\n\nUltimately I left it as neither of us were backing down and I try to keep a calm home, but my wife can tell I'm still upset and is telling me I'm acting like the immature teen now. She's a teen girl and in the first generation fully able to be open about things that were previously unspoken.\n\nI understand where shes coming from, but I am still allowed to be uncomfortable and not want to hear about it. If she wants to talk about her period with her friend, go ahead, but in private. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can definitely see your daughter going no contact and your wife divorcing you if this is the hill you want to die on. Read a book. What is your issue with periods? Half of the population has them. They are a sign of our feminine power and ability to conceive which is extremely powerful. Also since you\u2019re clearly uniformed your daughters friend was referencing the fact that she synced up to your daughters cycle due to your daughter starting her period. If you didn\u2019t know, the moon controls all tides on earth including menses. Women tend to bleed on the new moon and ovulate on the full moon when the earth is fertile. It\u2019s science.

I was totally shocked at first not because there is any reason she shouldn\u2019t I just couldn\u2019t relate at that age. I think it\u2019s fantastic and her brother will totally be the guy, if he chooses to date women, that will pick up the tampons for his girl.

Around his friends in the car? In his house? In a locker room? Or online playing call of duty? Have at it man. But out in public, loudly inside a gas station? To your point, it's 2023, not the dark ages.

Body shame is one of my least favorite aspects of this timeline, and women bear the greater burden, unfortunately.\n\nTo be a young boy dealing with coming into sexual maturity is very stressful. But that is a separate issue! And facing the knowledge that a period will happen regularly for decades is a fucking bummer.

Idk he's the adult so people assume he's the parent...and especially loudly proclaiming it in public...yea I'd be embarrassed if it was my kid being gross and obnoxious (again gross denotes talking about blood not periods) in public.

And could she please allow him to be out of earshot next time.\n\nI absolutely get where he is coming from with being uncomfortable & basically some things shouldn\u2019t be said in certain settings.

Rightly or wrongly, it seems that she's feeling rejected by her dad as a woman whenever she brings up that kind of stuff, hence her comments.

She's not saying out of the blue, that she doesn't want him as her father", "Completely agreed. It's bathroom talk, inappropriate to say loudly in a store. There is a time and place. I hope I could say that he would have been just as upset about a son saying something anatomically gross, but somehow I doubt it.", "I'm not sure what your point is? Do you support men talking like that? Think it's totally appropriate and that everyone should support it and never confront them on it? Or is this a, because one group does it, despite it being gross and rude, the other group should also do it?

Idk he might be acting a little immature...but she also kinda needs an attitude check, she knows what's appropriate in public\n\nAlso again we don't know about their home dynamic, but I get the feeling like he probably is more annoyed than angry. I think he still allows her to talk openly about it at home\n\nAgain the annoyance is immature, but I have a feeling like she's just acting like a bratty teenager clashing with authority. Still to tell your dad that repeatedly when you argue...that's just cruel", "He said at the end, that she's allowed to talk about it with her friends, but not at home around him at all. If she is just being a teenager, doing it more bc her dad has an issue with it, then his method isn't going to get her to stop, only do it more. But it really reads to me that she is feeling personally rejected by her dad whenever he says things like this and that OP really needs to look further into why she's making comments about him wanting a son instead, and the feelings motivating her to say that. People don't say things like that for no reason. Yes it's cruel of her to say, but she's only saying it because she feels he's being cruel to her first"]}
