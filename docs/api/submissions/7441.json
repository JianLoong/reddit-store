It absolutely destroyed our marriage and the resentment is strong.\n\nHe was confident he would get custody of our kids because he makes a significant amount more than me and his family is pretty wealthy. He was also sure that Alex would want to move with him because he loves the place my ex wants to move to and plans to attend college in that state.

He has tried to pressure Alex but to our surprise, Alex is not interested in his father's bribes.\n\nHe went as far as buying a house there and met a local woman about 6 months after we filed. She is pressuring him to move full-time. He can only afford a 1 bedroom apartment in our hometown right now.

The best scenario is for our kids to have 2 homes that are comfortable and close by and I am very aware of this but still believe it should be in our home state.\n\nHe wanted to meet for dinner the other night and I agreed.

I could have a much more comfortable life if I agree to these terms (they would be legally binding) but I still shut it down because this is the reason we got divorced.

This is the crux of the whole thing and what your ex doesn't understand: that it isn't about the money. \n\nHe thinks you're being vindictive and holding out for more, so he keeps offering more, until it becomes almost grotesque, how obvious it is that he thinks he just needs to buy you (and your kids) with the right amount to get what he wants.\n\nBut he's missing the point completely. This isn't about money, or about you being spiteful or vindictive or wanting ANYTHING from him. This is about the fact that YOU HAVE A LIFE WHERE YOU ARE. He doesn't see you or the kids as whole humans . . . just as accessories to be dragged along to wherever HE wants to be. But you ARE whole, autonomous humans. You have INVESTED OF YOURSELVES where you live now. You don't just have a job, you have friends, a life, favourite places to spend time. And yes, you can theoretically make new friends, find new favourite places. But you don't want to - you NEVER wanted to. He did. You like the friends you have where you are, the life you have now. And so do your kids. So why would all of you give that up at any price just because he wants a different one? Why is his dream, as a single person, more important than all of your established lives?\n\nHe needs to get his priorities straight. He is not the centre of the universe. You all do not need to revolve around him like the sun. And you are NTA for understanding that.", "NTA. \n\nYou are allowed to live where you want, just as HE is allowed to live where HE wants. He has to pick: the weather/new partner or being near his kids until they all are out of the house.  You are just fine where you are.", "NTA - How could a partner be so focused on living somewhere he's willing to give up his marriage AND his children? This guy is nuts and has his priorities backward.", "Not the asshole! He isnt thinking about anyone, but himself. He isnt thinking about how this would affect the children or the fact he let it destroy your marriage. It sounds to me like he still wants you to be with him, but only if you agree to what he wants. Just an observation. If he really wanted to do the right thing, he should have waited like you said, for the kids to finish school.", "NTA. You had a plan, and he threw your whole marriage away over this move.\n\nSounds like he should just admit this \"warmer climate home\" was more important to him than his family and move full time. He can get his kids for a few weeks over the summer.", "NTA.  Don't put your living situation under his control.  He'll change the terms at his whim, and threaten to change them further to control you.", "INFO how close are you to a full pension and is it a sustainable amount of money? So far NTA.", "NTA\n\nHis current situation is on him and having an obsession to move states. He let it ruin the marriage and jumped the gun by assuming everything was going to go his way. Why the hell did he buy a house down there without knowing he could live in it? Right, because he was arrogant.\n\nNow it wouldn't be wrong of you to accept the offer if you think it was good enough but it's also valid to have no interest in it. Have *your* lawyer look it over and consider other problems before signing anything if you change your mind. I would just assume there could be shenanigan in the document or some issue where he tries to get custody again after moving.\n\nPS There is a really good chance that local women is a rebound or is going to ruin him worse when she files.", "NTA but it seems much simpler to just give him the summers + alternating holidays and let him move to his warmer climate.   That is a pretty common schedule when the parents live far away.", "NTA, you made an agreement to move after retirement. Him wanting to change that now is his own problem, not yours..", "NTA \n\nHe thought he'd win custody 'cause he makes more $$... turns out court didn't like uprooting your children so dad can work on his tan.", "NTA he decided to  bully you and then tried to bribe you, stay where you are. Let him go catch his tan on his own, none of this is your fault", "NTA.  I doubt the higher alimony would make up for the pension or for uprooting the kids.  I understand moving kids when you *have to* for work, but doing it on a whim, especially at those ages, is cruel.", "NTA. This actually really has nothing to do with how OP makes her husband feel or how the husband makes OP feel. If the kids are better off where they\u2019re presently at, then they should stay.", "NTA", "NTH if you are basing your \u201cno\u201d on the same principle: not wanting to uproot your kids\u2019 lives and wanting what\u2019s best for them.\n\nA tiny bit of ESH if you are letting the move being the cause for divorce be the biggest reason you said no, and if it would result in a better quality of life for your kids.

But I'm wondering why your hubby didn't just move anyway?  When you are subject to a parenting plan, the CUSTODIAL parent needs to ask for court permission to move, if moving more than a certain distance.  But because he has a penis, there was no way he was going to win custody.   So his lawyer should have informed him that custody was not on the table.\n\nStill, as a non-custodial, there is nothing stopping him from living anywhere he wants to.  It makes it tough to see your kids.  But here's the deal...even if you live in the same zip code, family courts screw you to the point where you basically can't see your kids often enough, anyway.  Every other weekend and a Thursday here and there?  Ridiculous.  Even if you stick to that meticulously, your kids become strangers after a couple of years.\n\nEx hubby is truly in a no-win situation as any father would be, if he files for divorce.  Best he can do now is move where he wants to move and have his lawyers mod the parenting plan to give him the kids two full months every Summer school break.  As well as weekly video chats, specified in the parenting plan (so custodial parent can't interfere without pissing off a judge)\n\nEdit:  In case I didn't make it clear, I judge NTA as it's not the ex-wife that is preventing the father from moving.  I can understand his reluctance to leave the city where his kids live, but only because he doesn't see \"the big picture\" yet.  Living near the kids while not being able to see them is worse, actually.", "I'm not saying your ex is right in his methods or obsession at any point along the way, but the way you're explaining it, it does seem like you're putting up roadblocks just because you can.\n\nIn the case of a divorce, it bothers me that people can't just try to remain a team for the sake of children. I also think that this could do with a bit more info. Did he propose this to the entire family to see if the kids wanted to move or if they wanted to stay at their school? Or did he bring this up to just you and you shut him down fully and completely without even a glimmer of consideration?\n\nWithout context, you seemingly took what sounds like a lifetime goal, a bucket list item from this man, and tore it up. I understand the stance of wanting to stay put until the kids are out of school, and you're able to get your pension, but money didn't seem like much of an issue.... So either the kids really didn't want to make this change and he wasn't listening to them, or you didn't want to go, and you have used the kids as your out.\n\nMaybe the kids wanted to move to the warmer climate originally, but not now that there would only be one parent there... I mean, you even claimed that one of your kids had plans on going to post secondary where your ex wanted to move.\n\nI know some people can get an unhealthy fixation on something, but I can relate to your ex husband in a way. He felt like he could give his family something great, only to find out that the other decision maker didn't find it so great.\n\nPeople uproot and move all the time. Sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity. Everyone survives... But you two were so set in your ways and hard headed that divorce was the best option?! \n\nThis is also where more info would be handy in passing judgement here... If I were to place a bet, I would wager a lot on the possibility that this obsession to move isn't the -only- reason this marriage fell apart. There has to be more to it than that - something where feelings have been hurt.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but that is the vibe I get.\n\nAnyway. He seems to be giving you a great deal with this new bargain, because you've put his pants parts in a vice. He's paying for an apartment mostly because you can force him to, which I think is really unfair... Again, it sounds like you're using your children as leverage.\n\nSo, I think this may be the best deal you're going to get, and in a way that your kids may benefit, he gets to spend his money in a more sensible way, and you get to claim a win.\n\nESH on this one for both you and your ex.

It is not a world-ending trauma to a child in middle school or their even younger siblings to relocate.\nYou could have relocated and combined your new state pension with the old. A solid outcome.\nI guess I am looking at it like, if it was this important to the man you loved, why wouldn't you change??\nThere doesn't seem to be a downside other than your \"plan\" to do it after retirement.

I would be sad that it came to that, but I'm not going to live somewhere that I'm certain that I would be miserable.", "I could get the same job in the new state and would be able to join their pension system and would still have my pension from my current state.  I wouldn't be left with no pension but staying until full years of service in one state is the most beneficial.", "I know someone who moved rather than end her marriage. Guess what? Her marriage ended anyway. But because this is where her kids are, she can't go back to her home state.", "... but it's ok for your husband to be miserable. Sounds fair to me.", "It\u2019s very smart to stay put and get the full value of any pension, since those benefits are few & far between these days. Plus, he\u2019s already proven to be petulant and will make life altering decisions unilaterally\u2014why risk your future financial security for his bullshit?", "He made himself miserable by letting his desire to move override his marriage and access to his kids.", "He's not her husband anymore.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nHe destroyed his family over a personal obsession, and I bet his kids know it. I bet they absolutely know this has nothing to do with acting in their best interest, it\u2019s just a selfish desire.\n\nHe was willing to uproot his kids when it wasn\u2019t necessary, and try to force you to uproot and lose your pension/financial security. \n\nAnd then he chooses to not have a home where his kids can sleep.\n\nWhat a selfish, self-centered individual. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are being vindictive - you don\u2019t want to move. You already offered reasonable compromises - moving at retirement, having a summer home - he was the one where it is all or nothing.\n\nHe was the one that wanted with no consideration for anyone else.", "NTA he picked this petty hill to die on then let him die on it. \n\nHe didn't care about you or the children when he tried to uproot you all for his selfish wants. Even a judge laughed him out of court because it's absurd a parent would be so blindly self centered. I'll bet he will very quickly just abandon the children too and move when he can't get his way. You and the children will be better off.", "NTA, and that's what the judge thought too.  Your kids are in school and have roots where you are.  Chris doesn't care.  The man really does sound like he has several screws loose if he's willing to give up his wife and children just bc he doesn't like the climate where you live.  \n\nI think it's probably very much for the best , and way better for you, that he's leaving town so you can continue to live where your kids have grown up, offering them security and stability.  \n\nYou are absolutely correct that the person ruining Chris' life is Chris.  Stay strong and ignore him.", "He\u2019s lost his mind, his marriage, and his kids. He got his cake, but the judge made sure he didn\u2019t get to eat it with his kids in the warm state.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. And I feel like he is blowing smoke up your ass. He can only afford a one bedroom apartment in your current town, but he can buy you a new house and pay extra alimony if you move?", "INFO: I gotta know where you live - is it Antarctica?  What\u2019s with the obsession with warmer weather???  Please don\u2019t give in to this.  You and your kids are happy where you are.  You have your pension you don\u2019t want to miss out on.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want to move and uproot your entire life.\n\nYour children don't want to move and uproot their entire lives.\n\nYour ex husband does want to move.\n\nIf it was just a simple choice between you and your husband, I would still give it to you - nobody should be forced to move if they don't want to, and given you presumably meet and married in your current location, I see that one as getting Lefebvre over the person wanting to move.\n\nAdd your children in however and I don't see there is much space for debate at all - one family members obsession with moving somewhere warmer does not overrule multiple other people who don't want to.\n\nIs this causing problems for your ex? Absolutely, but those were problems everyone else saw coming from a mile off, and are entirely of his own making, and for him to figure out on his own.", "NTA He\u2019s an idiot; a selfish idiot.", "NTA. That being said we all have the right to be happy. It\u2019s unfortunate that this was the crux of the divorce, but he knows what he wants and he wants to live somewhere warm. In the long run OP will get blamed for being the bad guy in this situation. Dad will just be the YOLO dad while mom is the controlling mom who had too many rules and requirements. OP might have won this battle, but will ultimately lose the war.", "NTA Do NOT put yourself in his power, no matter how good the terms seem.", "Nta but im kind of confused. He makes a lot of money and his family is wealthy and he is upping his offer to you, how can he only afford a 1 bedroom??  I guess id look at it and compare what he would be paying you in alimony and child support and see what the difference is compared to your potential pension losses, check where the kids actually want to live if the housing situation was equal and think about if you would be happy living in the new state or not.  If the plan was always for you to eventually move to new state after retirement you may be able to make the move if everything else makes sense.", "Your ex could die and the increased alimony would cease at that point.  Is there some reason he could not have the kids for a lengthy time in the summer?", "NTA, and the info you provided about your youngest\u2019s needs is IMO worthy of being in the post. Do any of the kids WANT to move?", "NTA. He's having a tantrum because other people won't let him live his dream. the reason he has a 1BR is because he bought a house somewhere he can't live, and he's being big mad that other people aren't falling over for him to have everything his way. Instead, he learned that family court is not Burger King. \n\nAlso as the parent of kids with learning disabilities, there is no amount of money you could pay me to leave the Northeast for most warm states. I have enough friends in TX/AZ/FL to be extremely sure about this.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to move he can have them for summers. He doesn't get to throw a fit until he gets his way", "Nta", "Agreed. NTA, OP. If your ex is so obsessed with living in the warmer climate (I grew up in Florida in the US, and warm weather 24/7 does get old) he can move and have the children visit him on an agreed upon schedule. You're not forcing him to stay in your home state. You're just providing a stable living environment for your children, which is your #1 priority. \n\nI'm sorry that your marriage ended over this and that a compromise couldn't be reached. Just do what you think is best for your kids.", "He met someone there. Only way it makes sense.", "Haha, the northeast of the US.", "I'm Canadian but it's was -40C here the other day so like. I would love to move. That's the part that makes the most sense out of all of this.", "Get ready to be downvoted... I agree with you 210% there is a missing piece here. No rational couple, let alone a married couple with any sort of solid foundation under them would allow their marriage to fall apart over this.", "We live in a very high-cost area and a two-bedroom is expensive think 3,000-4,000 a month for a nicer place.  The taxes on my home are very high and he pays me a lot of money for alimony and child support so I can stay in the family home.  He also bought a very expensive home in the other state. He is spread a little thin compared to what he is used to and his family did not agree with him so they are slightly less inclined to help. \n\nI did not want to go because I do not believe it is in the best interest of any of my children but especially my youngest who has learning disabilities.", "He could, but he wants to be with them year round  which I have no problem with, it's just not going to happen where he wants it to happen.", "I never gave them the option to be honest, they are pretty young and I needed to think about all of their needs.  They are content in their current schools but my youngest is my main concern. I believe my older 2 would thrive anywhere.", "And alone.", "Well tough shit for him. He can\u2019t unilaterally decide to disrupt all of your entire lives because he wants to live somewhere else. He\u2019s not thinking of his kids best interest, just his own selfish desires. The judge even said so. He can move, but y\u2019all are staying put. If he wanted to be with his kids full time, he should have waited to make the move. \n\nYou\u2019re doing right by your kids, op. Stand tough and firm in your decision. It\u2019s the right one.", "He wants control. And to be seen as the good guy/dad", "Please tell me someone got the divorce court staff\u2019s reaction on video.", "Would he also like a cookie and the moon on a stick?\n\nThe level of entitlement because he can't have everything he wants, good Lord.", "I suppose to say nice was an over simplification. Idk much about schools or spec Ed learning programs myself. My son's autistic, but so are his mothers' so they are able to deal with most of that. Being allistic, I basically just get the gist of how to handle them(my son, like myself and his birth mom, is NB) during situations in which they are ... Not sure how to say this without coming across as an asshole myself, having difficulty. But if that's the case, asking them to leave a program where they are doing well, just for warmer weather, does seem very selfish, provided there is no real medical reason why. Unless you guys live somewhere obscenely frigid, and he wants to move to some one horse podunk area like the swamps of the Southeast US, I don't think you're the asshole here. Especially if there is more family than just your mom.", "My family moved when I was 12 and I feel very strongly about not doing the same to my kids unless there\u2019s some necessity. This is not a necessity. This is a tantrum.", "Lol NorthEast summers aren\u2019t even cold! 80s, 90s heat waves\u2026. So he did all this to avoid cold weather in the winter??", "That\u2019s what I was wondering - how cold would it have to be, to be willing to give up your wife and kids to be in warmer weather?", "How much research have you actually done into the schools where this move was supposed to happen, and how much bias is going into you deeming them as just \"okay.\"\n\nBecause if you were able to entertain the thought enough to check out the state of the schools there, and look into the status of your pension moving over, how unreasonable is it to take that extra step and consider moving there?", "Then that's the answer. You were putting your child's needs over your ex's desires, and you should continue on this path.  It's telling that the oldest don't want to move either.   He just needs to adapt to the situation that he created. NTA.", "Hope you don't mind, but I'm taking this for the next time I hear my sister say \"Go to hell.\" To her ex. Lol", "Yes, but he's still not simply walking away from his children to do it. He's harassing his wife to try and force her to go with him. \n\nI understand his position, actually. When I divorced, I was stuck for a decade in a place where I really didn't want to live, because I couldn't move without leaving my children behind and that was simply not going to happen. I did ask my ex if he would be willing to consider moving with me, to any of half a dozen places where I would've been comfortable, but he was determined to stay put. I couldn't realistically say that was unreasonable of him. *I* hated it here, but he didn't, and he had built a career and a life here. \n\nSo we stayed. For another decade, and now I'm within one year of being free to move, when my youngest finishes high school. Sure, I'm going to get out when I can. But I didn't handle it stupidly, and this guy did. It is not his ex-wife's job to dig him out of the hole he got into by handling it stupidly.", "My parents had to move often when I was a child out of necessity.\n\nIt was awful every time.", "Oh yeah, this is about winter which is why a \"vacation\" home wasn't enough because of my job and our children's school, we would only be able to \"live\" in the state in the summer when it would be hot in either place.", "The move was never supposed to happen.  We never agreed to this, we agreed to move when schools were no longer an issue. Given that I am an educator, I am very aware of the state of education in the state.  I am aware of the shortage of teachers the state is currently experiencing as well  \n\nEven if it was the most amazing school district in that state, I do not feel comfortable pulling my son from his current placement because he has made amazing strides.  My ex felt I was being overprotective but I am the expert in the household when it comes to education.", "Ah yeah source: trust me bro", "Anecdote does not equal data.

I said that if he was determined to move to one of the places where I couldn't tolerate living, I would accept a divorce; I didn't say that I would try to force him to stay where he hated. \n\nI would try hard to find a compromise first -- I would think it likely that, out of the whole wide world, we could find someplace where neither of us would be miserable! But if he were absolutely insistent that the ONLY place in all of existence where he could ever be happy were the very one where I would be miserable, then we would no longer be compatible. At that point, it would be time to set each of us free to go where we would, without the other."]}
