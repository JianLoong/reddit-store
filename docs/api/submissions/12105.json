During the pregnancy, they wanted to keep the gender a surprise until birth and were doing old wives' tales and settled on a boy since that's what the tales were saying.  \n\nSince they were so convinced they settled on one name in particular 'Henri' I want to emphasise I have no issue with that name I think it's a nice name and I did try telling them not to get their hopes up because the baby might not be a boy. \n\nWell, the baby was born, and It turned out to be a girl they were disappointed but happy. They hadn't decided on a name up until yesterday. They announced the name as henriettah. Yes, that's the spelling. They asked me as her grandmother what I thought of the name, and I told them I wasn't a fan of the name. They seemed pretty angry, but I reassured them it's not my child and not my choice to make, but they did ask for my opinion, and I gave it and I wasn't going to convince them to change it but if that's the name then that's the name and i will accept that. Still, they're pretty angry and said i could have lied to them.\n\nEdit 1: I love the name! Things take time to grow on people, and i love my grand daughter. \n\nEdit 2: For the people asking how our relationship is, it's very good, actually.
