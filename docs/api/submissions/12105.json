They may be biologically male or female.  When they reach kindergarten the teacher will determine what gender they were meant to be.  Many children will \"transition\" to a new gender.  Haven't you been watching cable news?", "I'm hoping that they forgot the \"/s\" for being sarcastic. While gender shouldn't be as *big* a fuss as it is now a days, considering the baby could turn out being trans, it's determined by the person themselves, *not* a kindergarden teacher.", "You dont ever call a baby ugly or tell parents that the name they have chosen for their baby is not good or you don't like it. Sometimes you just don't tell the truth or simply smile saying 'its beautiful' as its what I have been taught to do.", "The h in Sarah and Leah completely change the way I pronounce those names, I wouldn\u2019t consider them extra. \n\n[Lea](https://youtu.be/mT9LuotAUmA) as an example.", "I didn't say it was a big deal, it just isn't my favorite (I have a daughter named Lila, a few other girls at her school are Lylah and I just don't love the H). I also have a student named Aliviah and an Adriannah, it isn't a huge deal, just not for me.", "That's actually a pretty common modern version of the name, a teacher in the comments mentions she has the same spelling for one of her kindergarten students,, and if you look at up on name meanings and origins it's pretty common.", "Right, I'm not mad at the name itself, I'm just mad that they added an 'h' to the end. Like, why? For what reason?", "To be fair, standardized spelling in general is fairly new to the game. Hard to say an old name is actually spelled wrong. It might end up being more archaic than wrong", "I was just going to say something like this. I have a 4 letter name, with something like 8 (that I can think of) different ways to spell it, all considered acceptable SOMEWHERE. If I don't spell it out, it's almost guaranteed they'll get it wrong.", "it was no accident they meant to spell it that way.  They love putting a unique twist on names.", "How is that worse?", "It depends, some parents actively look for third opinions and value the feedback. If you don't want to know people's opinions, don't ask for them.", "Leah maybe, but Sara and Sarah are often both pronounced the same, no?", "I have a name that often has an H. Most of these names with H\u2019s are derived from Hebrew names, which have the letter hei at the end. Also silent. They\u2019re often pronounced exactly the same. Most American Lea\u2019s pronounce their name just like Leah. Lee-uh.", "Please explain more. How do Sarah and Sara differ? I had a drunk girl once tell me that they weren\u2019t not pronounced the same and I was so fucking confused because every Sara/Sarah I\u2019ve known said those the same way.", "I was more agreeing with you vs. the previous comment that talked about OP \u201ctrying to save\u201d Henriettah. Save from what? The utter humiliation of having to correct the spelling of your name? My name is 4 letters and is an H name. My company spelled it wrong on my business AMEX. I\u2019m not humiliated.", "They\u2019re going to have ten kids and name them all [henriettah](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SA7EJJv1oWg)", "Poor child", "It isn't unique given lots of people do this thing these days.", "Kids will tease her for having boys name. As i have said little kids are vicious. Im sure you understand the name \u201cHenri\u201d isnt the best name for a girl to have", "I pronounce Sara and Sarah differently.", "No. I went to school with 1 Sara and many Sarahs, they were pronounced differently.", "They are pronounced differently. Where I live: Sarah is like \"Sair-ah\"...Sara is like \"Sah-rah\"", "I think the difference is in the stress, so like Sah-ra vs Sa-rah. Idk if these makes sense, but they sound different in my mind \ud83d\ude02", "To me it\u2019s sah-ra (Sara) and say-rah (Sarah)\u2026\n\nRead these names that much in this comment threat neither sound right now\u2026", "In the UK Lea would usually be pronounced Lee. Sara is pronounced Sah-ra in most cases.", "Interestingly, my (real) name is a Hebrew female name that ends in A, not AH. I don\u2019t know why, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be an H variation of it.", "Henrietta is a girls name though.", "They are the same.", "My (American) daughter is named Sara; same pronunciation as Sarah. When she moved to the UK, everyone pronounced her name as Sah-ra. It bothered her at first, but now she answers to either one.", "It\u2019s Levi-OSA not Levi-o-SAH", "They should not be pronounced differently. They are an anglicized spelling of the exact same Hebrew name. Which was in the Torah/Old Testament and is the reason the name is so popular across the globe.", "Not in the states. Source. Am Jewish with an H name.", "Names like Rebecca were spelled that way in the New Testament. It was Rebekah in the Old.", "Oh it\u2019s from what you would call the Old Testament, not from the Christian bible. Book of Ruth.", "Okay its not gonna make any difference. Have you seen how little kids make fun of others? Either way the kid is gonna get bullied into oblivion for having an unusual name. Little kids are vicious when it comes to bullying.", "That's not necessarily true.  I live in the states and have seen Lea and Leah pronounced differently.", "I don\u2019t agree. Henrietta would be one of the least unusual names at my kids school. Names are so wildly varied these days with so many cultures present that it\u2019s just not a big deal. I\u2019ve never heard of any kid at any of my kids schools being bullied for a name.", "What\u2019s your point? Bullies will always find something to bully you about, whether it\u2019s an unusual name, wearing glasses or that time you sneezed weird. For all you know she might get bullied for having a common name (differentiating Johns in class by adding a usually unflattering adjective in front? Never had John and Fat John in your class?) \n\nNow OP is NTA because she was asked and gave her opinion plus that spelling is atrocious. But Henrietta without the extra H is a perfectly reasonable name.", "Hence the usage of the word \u201cmost\u201d.", "Leah is my name. It\u2019s pronounced \u201cLee-ah\u201d. I\u2019ve only ever seen Lea pronounced \u201cLee\u201d. Am in the southern US", "Thats your experience. Not every peoples experience is gonna be the same as your. Its very likely the kid is gonna get bullied for her name. Kids get bullied by others kids for different hair colors and even different foods they bring to lunch they bully people for the smallest thing im positive she is gonna face some sort of bullying due to her unusual name.", "Yeah thats my fucking point? I said she will definitely get bullied for her name because its unusual by bullies. And also are you having a stroke? Henrietta without the extra H? Enrietta? When was this even brought up?", "I didn\u2019t say kids don\u2019t get bullied. I said that in todays world, it\u2019s not an unusual name."]}
