I know people that are Religious Studies majors that would love, love, LOVE to have a binder like that.  Your \"friend\" is overly defensive of her religion, almost to the point that the most important Tennant of many major religions is to be a good and moral person.\n\nI think it would be helpful that everyone take a lesson from my favorite Pseudo-religion...\"Be excellent to each other,\"", "NTA you've done nothing wrong. It's an educational binder collection for your use. There are pros and cons of all religions and you aren't being insulting I assume in your wording for the lists. She was out of line in spreading that about, too. You aren't the AH, she is.", "NTA. Just because you're not actively religious you're not allowed to learn about them? Especially when this binder is for your own personal use and interest. A pro/con list about religions might be oversimplified, but it's not racist. Your friend is being unreasonable.", "NTA. What a neat project! Your interest could take you interesting places.  \n\nIMO God hold us to love our neighbors, and how better to love than to learn about them?", "NTA, this is one of the weirdest takes on religion ever.

It could grow into a nice thesis if you decide to pursue this interest.", "NTA. You're allowed to research other religions, keep information on them, compare/contrast, pro/con, etc. to your heart's content. Until you openly start bad-mouthing a religion to others, there's nothing inherently racist or forbidden. Aaaaand religion is NOT race. So there's that.", "NTA.  If she finds your binder offensive, she can choose to not look at it.", "NTA - you\u2019re analytical and she\u2019s spiritual, she has no right to ask you to throw away research. Questioning religion is normal", "She's ridiculous. Keep your binder", "NTA. Your friend is giving off big Jehovah\u2019s Witness vibes. As a survivor, let me say it\u2019s a religion that so believes in gatekeeping they\u2019ve moved away from printed materials to just use an app to make it harder to leave proof when the Truth changes again.", "NTA she\u2019s being ridiculous, you can absolutely write and have info about other religions, that\u2019s what theologians do", "NTA. You are educating yourself in a way that's different from most and your friend should have been thrilled to see you are trying to understand not just one group of people but all groups of people.", "NTA. She's being a weird sort of gatekeeper.

I use it for my recipes that I'm fiddling with.", "You do not have to pick a religion. No religion is a perfectly acceptable life path. Your grandma is wrong about this one. And your friend is exhibiting a persecution complex. There is nothing wrong with your binder.", "Different religions are really interesting especially their roles in human history.  If you like knowing about other religions maybe you should look into learning more NTA.", "NTA but agreed with another commenter that you're not exactly getting unbiased pro/con information if you're talking to practitioners for pros and ex-members for cons. I'd argue that faith isn't really a pro/con thing anyway. There are differences in a practice, or things an individual person dislikes, not objective upsides and downsides. \n\nIt's absolutely possible for the people you're interviewing to have biased, inaccurate, and yes even racist views. I'd consider that part of your binder more like an ethnographic interview. But no, absolutely you don't have to stop doing it.", "She\u2019s probably mad about the cons because you\u2019re right \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\n There is nothing wrong in getting interessed in researching other cultures/religions.

That being said no religion is perfect and if your friend can\u2019t realize this, that\u2019s her problem. She has no right to tell you to get rid of your personal item because she finds it offensive", "NTA - I honestly feel like if you *didn't* have a pros and cons of her religion she'd call you racist for excluding her religion. She didn't use even 'racist' correctly in the first place.", "NTA", "This all hinges on what you wrote as \"pros and cons\" about this religion - that could range from anything like saying \"One pro for pastafarians is the nifty head gear they sport\" to \"one con for (insert religion) is the way they eat babies\" - we don't know (and I'm not going to ask) what you wrote, so I can't say whether it's bigoted (it does sound like race is actually a factor here) or not.", "I don't know. That's definitely not racist.... but its not exactly nice either? I can see her side of things but at the same time I don't see a problem with having your opinions and this information written down. I guess much like our thoughts, we need to moderate what is shared as to not offend or hurt anyone. Maybe going forward, just keep the binder to yourself.\nI'd apologize to your friend for hurting her feelings, but the binder is kind of like a journal and you shouldn't have to throw it away just because you wrote something she didnt like in it.

She will try to destroy it. The study of religion is a formal discipline. Is she going to destroy all the notes of every scholar? Who does she think writes about religions for people to google?

I'm assuming this is a Jewish girl - Ashkenazi is a race. Anti-Semitism is racism.  I could be wrong of course about her being Jewish.  She could be a Wiccan...but what are the odds? And then it would still be bigotry, just not racism.", "Pros are from people in the religion, cons are from people who left the religion its not my own ideas or thoughts", "It wasn't not nice either though. It is not a slam book of cultures/religions. It is his own personal research into other cultures for informational purposes, not a catalog for people to use to choose a religion.\n\nHe gave her a glimpse of something that would be akin to a journal: his own personal beliefs and reflections on his discoveries that he used to help guide his development as a person.

Those are just the pieces that did not mean well with him as a person.\n\nOP is NTA", "I like my binder it started out as a way for ne to find my religion and becane a way for me to learn how indigenous ideas are sometimes still used, which plants are used or use to be in medical practices abd its interesting", "When you were 10?! \nYou sound like you were an impressive 10 year old. I personally love the idea of this research and wish more people could objectively look at other cultures and religions. \n\nYour friend means well, but this kind of censorship actually leads to a population steeped in ignorance and intolerance. And I would know, I live in FL", "Many people would probably see the pros and cons as offensive because it would feel like you're reducing a religion down to a zero sum game or a case of \"which one gets me the best perks?\"\n\nIf you're coming at a religion from that perspective it would be horrifying to most laypeople because the point of a religion is to believe in the tenets and commands and the philosophy of how you're supposed to love your life. \n\nBasically they'd think that it looks like you're going about things backwards.", "Your friend doesn\u2019t know what a racist is.", "Then, they are not unbiased pro/con lists. If you balanced it by asking those still practicing what the cons were and those that left it what the pros were, it would be less problematic. \n\nHaving the lists isn't inherently \"racist,\" but the items listed may be.", "She's overreacting. It sounds like an interesting collection.", "Yeah, I definitely don't think you're the AH for having an interest in religions. I think your friend just didn't like what she saw and reacted poorly.", "Oh, I completely misunderstood that in the original post - if you're documenting criticism (pro and con) I don't see a problem. \n\nNTA unless you are quoting Hitler's thoughts on Judaism or something.", "I started at ten because i went to Sunday school and the unicorn story of the bible made me question alot and so ya, lead to research mostly from livrary books at first and that lead to writing my findings because the books had to go back, so ya binder", "She said judging it was rasict, aka the cons sheet made me a rasict for having it", "Well sometimes i got cons from people in but they often really were defensive or didnt want to say, well some people who left did have pros, but not always, it just depends on whos story im reading and when it was written i guess", "There is not such thing as an unbiased pro-con list. It\u2019s always specific to the person making it and their perspective. If I\u2019m making up a pro-con list on dogs to get for me a pro is \u201clarge and energetic\u201d but that may be very much a con for others.

His mistake was showing it to anyone else.", "Ive been doing it since i was 10, and sometimes i end up with more books and binders and such", "Oh god no id never use someones ideas who absolutely detested it in such a way, they need to still have respect for human beings in order for me to consider their opinions into my binder for me to look over and read later", "The person above this is correct, your friend doesn\u2019t understand what racism is.", "As I said, she doesn\u2019t understand what a racist actually is and apparently neither do you.", "Then you need to push for more or, at least, understand you are not getting a true, unbiased picture of the religion. Everyone's exes are horrible, right? Your \"research\" is little more than gossip. \n\nIf you truly want to understand a religion, sit down with a leader in the local congregation, talk with a theologist at your local college, read their holy book yourself, attend services available to you, and use your own critical thinking. \n\nI can see where your list would upset your friend. Boiling her faith down to Pros and Cons is insulting.", "Okay", "Rasicm is judging someone for their race i believe, which is something id never do but i wasnt sure if i was wrong for what i was doing and with people irl telling me it was rasict i was questioning my own thinking", "I have read several books on several religions but that goes on seperate pages, the pros and cons page is not my thoughts or ideas, my thoughts and ideas go on seperate pages so i dont mix it in with peoples who have experienced it themselves, and the only relugion in my area is Christianity lol", " This is her private binder with her thoughts in it. She has no obligation to make some politically correct piece of work out of it just because you and her friend think that she should.", "Then the people you surround yourself with are ignorant.", "Except your friend, though. She's a different religion. How were you able to talk to so many people of different faiths to compile these lists? \n\nI'm willing to bet there is more religious diversity in your area than you know. And, even if there isn't, the internet can connect you with rabbis, priests, imams, pastors, etc. Part of their job is teaching, and many are happy to talk to someone who is genuinely curious. Services are online now, too.\n\nAnd, more than books on several religions, actually read parts of the Torah, the Koran, or what have you. It is great that you have this interest, and starting this at age 10 is very admirable. Again, having the pro/con lists isn't the problem. It's the surface level judgment of someone's faith that is problematic.", "His and he shared it with someone else. Not private. \n\nAlso, I didn't say he should do anything with the lists. I made suggestions on how to get a better understanding of religions. I made no judgment on A H or not.", "Until the international exchange student program the religions in ky area were....well there was a max of three or four, and almost everyone was white, so having people of color in the area or different religions is still...a work in progress for many older people and the younger generations still struggle, i just try my hardest to accept and understand everyone as best i can", "My university has alot of students from all over the world as an international student program, and so i get chances to talk to people from every part of the world which is fun, and so thats kinda what came up, and the pros and cons list was a ten year old me idea to try and help me pick a faith because my grandmother said i needed to have one, so thats how it started and it was really only for Christianity until recently when one of my friends whos muslim was complaining about parts of it and then we got to chatting and she showed me her own list, and we got to disgusing her faith and i just kept making them with people who were willing to add their thoughts on pros and cons of their faith.", " That person asked to see it. That in no way gives them any right to insist that everything in it be politically correct to their judgment.", "Which is why you are not the problematic one because you\u2019re trying to learn about multiple religions. It\u2019s completely possible to list the pros and cons of a religion from an educational standpoint and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the wrong. The fact they think you\u2019re a racist for learning about multiple religions shows how uneducated and close minded they are.", "Great. I understand all of that.\n\nI'm not going to reiterate my suggestions on how to research because you are a college student, and that's your professors' jobs. Presumably, you came here for advice, and I've given it.", "Okay", "I will ne taking your advice and tryibg to use it as it doesnt hinder my research wnd helps it, religions and cultures are a curiosity of mine"]}
