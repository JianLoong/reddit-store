Services are online now, too.\n\nAnd, more than books on several religions, actually read parts of the Torah, the Koran, or what have you. It is great that you have this interest, and starting this at age 10 is very admirable. Again, having the pro/con lists isn't the problem.

That way, she'd be adding to your collection of thoughts. But it sounds like she simply took offense to the information you gathered and that your encounter wasn't constructive.

They\u2019re writing a subjective list of things they (and maybe others) find to be positive or negative about various aspects of various religions. \n\nCriticism itself is not problematic. Criticizing people for not believing the same thing you do or for subscribing to that religion is problematic.

It is not prejudiced to disagree with a religious practice. OP is not indicating that they judge individual people for practicing these religions. \n\n> Having the lists isn't inherently \"racist,\" but the items listed may be.\n\nThe I do not see how any items listed in a pro and con list about a RELIGION could be in any way RACIST unless OP wrote some bullshit like \u201ctoo many Indians\u201d in the con column for \u201cHinduism.\u201d Which I very much suspect is NOT the case. \n\nRace and religion are not the same. \n\nIt is racist to make negative assumptions about people based on beliefs you assume that they have, because you are assuming their religion because of their skin colour (eg someone is brown and therefore is Muslim and therefore believes xyz - obviously problematic).\n\nIt is NOT racist to personally find fault with a religion that happens to be practiced by a lot of minorities in various iterations.", "They can feel however they want, it shouldn't matter to OP.

Sorry but it is. Yes these are fantastic ways to understand religions. They\u2019re not the only valid ways. I\u2019m sure OP has done some of these in some iteration or another.
