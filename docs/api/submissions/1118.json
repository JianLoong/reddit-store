Apologize, dial back on the sarcasm in front of students, and move forward.", "YTA. Definitely unprofessional to do that in front of the students. He's correct that it was undermining him. As a general rule, don't use sarcasm towards people you don't know well.", "ESH. The running sarcasm/being moderately unprofessional from your entire group sucks. Your coworker being a toddler and saying \"check your chat\" to you instead of just talking like an adult sucks. \n\n\nGo in today, sit in his office and apologize for making him feel that way. Don't make excuses just apologize and move on professionally. And ffs your whole group needs to stop that around students.", "You do realise saying \"do not repost\" means absolutely nothing?", "NAH. I really doubt you undermined his authority, but yes he might have felt embarrassed if that didn't match with his presentation in front of students. Just explain in a second apology (maybe face-to-face) that you were feeling stressed in the chaotic atmosphere and it just came out as a way to minimize the tension and you're sorry it was at his expense as it wasn't meant to be at all.", "I would argue that your colleague was being rude - and disrespectful of your boundaries - by interrupting your tutoring a student to ask you to help him instead. And then acting butt-hurt!\n\nWhat he should have done instead was to ask you to please help him \\*when you are done\\* with the task at hand.\n\n\u201cI apologize for being brisk with you \\[that one time\\]. Going forward, please wait until I am finished with \\[task at hand\\] before trying to pull me away to assist you\u201d should do it.\n\nNTA", "Shit happens. Yes, it was a dangerous thing to say, and it went wrong.\n\nYou sincerely tried to apologize and 'repair things', and probably are going to talk to him about it again next week.\n\nIt is understandable that he feels hurt, and so he is not that quick with forgiving.\n\nI can't see no AH's here.\n\nNAH", "YTA. But it's good that you know this and have apologised.\n\nYou need to remember that you're not the only person who feels nervous, insecure etc - your colleagues will feel all these things too. You, inadvertently, made a joke at your colleague's expense and it didn't feel good being him in that moment - he's newer and clearly wants support from you, not 'sass'.\n\nYou haven't ruined your relationship with him but try to remember other people feels stress too.", "Thank you. I blurted it out and regret it. I wish I wasn't so awkward.", "That's fair. Thank you for your time. I will try harder in the future.", "Thank you. I know. I wish I didn't say it. We don't get to talk to each other much in front of students, usually we work with them in one-on-one settings.", "Thank you. I will definitely be apologizing further, which I dread, but is necessary.", "Thank you for your comment. I will definitely try to make ammends."]}
