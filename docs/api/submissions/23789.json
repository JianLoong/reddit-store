His brother still smokes bud. On the first night brother asked him if he would like to try his new pipe. He tried it. I didnt say anything. After all, brother asked him if he wanted a hit, so i thought id seem like a real dick if i held that against him.\n\nSecond day, partners neice comes round with her new baby. Whole family has cuddles. Brother says hes going upstairs (to hit his bong) and my partner asks if he could have a hit, too, so they both go upstairs. \n\nPartner comes down looking really blazed and asks if I'm ok. I simply say its really hard because i feel like im quitting on my own but that i dont want to discuss it now as neice is over with the baby and this is their moment. \n\nHe keeps asking if I'm ok and do I want to talk, but i say not right now as neice is over now and we can talk about it later. \n\nApparently while im out the room, brother's partner mentions that i seem upset, and once neice leaves, my partner apologises for making me feel bad. I just say its been really hard for me to quit everything as i havent really been sleeping. We talk about why that is  and i say i have no problem with him having a drink with his brother. Even them having a pre planned trip in a few weeks where they will go and take shrooms (that i picked) just that smoking has been hard for me to quit especially as he said we would do it together.\n\n\nToday we had an argument, and he tells me i should have just go let his brother and him hit the bong when they wanted as they haven't seen each other in a year and that i made him feel like an asshole for smoking and that ruined the visit. That he isnt the pregnant one so he doesnt have to quit anything, and that i made the whole thing uncomfortable especially that brother and his partner noticed that i was upset, the focus shouldnt have been on me but on neice and her new child. \n\nAm i the asshole?\n\nTo add: he was actually the first one to bring up quitting and assured me we would be doing it together.

Instead of him taking a trip to use shrooms you should both seek addiction counseling and get proper help before bringing a baby into the dynamic.  Or start looking into adoption options as it doesn't sound like a suitable environment for an infant.", "Dude\u2019s gaslighting you now that he\u2019s realizing how hard it is to follow through on his commitment. Period.", "Imma say NTA, you can feel how you want.\n\nBut if he is only going to do it on a trip with his brother, amd thats it, he should get a break.\n\nIts a problem if he stsrts doing it again around your house etc.", "NTA. you don\u2019t need to smoke to have a good time with someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while and you can certainly find other things to do to fill up that time. it seems to me like he\u2019s lacking maturity and respect in this situation. \n\n(anyone commenting who wants to jump on my ass and make fun because i said you can have a good time sober, maybe reevaluate your life if you feel you NEED any kind of substance to enjoy your time with another human being.) \n\nyou mentioned it was HIS idea to quit together. you didn\u2019t force him to or even suggest that he should. he should realize that him going back on quitting not only breaks a promise he made to you, but it\u2019s probably making you more tempted to smoke when you can\u2019t on account of the pregnancy.", "NTA. How much are you two planning to smoke once that baby arrives?", "NTA. My parents quit smoking and drinking together too when my mom was pregnant. It just seems like common sense to me. If your partner has to carry your baby it\u2019s not nice to indulge in all of their vices they had to give up practically in front of them.", "NTA. \n\nCan you ask your doc about things to help you sleep? Your husband\u2019s actions of going back on an agreement, any agreement but especially one that HE initiated, make him TA. But lack of sleep is my personal hell even when I\u2019m not pregnant,  so I\u2019d encourage you to ask a doctor about things that can help you rest.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is an adult, and does not need your permission.", "NAH. Quitting addiction is hard. You quitting cold turkey is harder. Quitting multiple substances is even harder. Your nightmares are from withdrawal. You need to stick with the program. It is very common for women to quit substances during pregnancy. It is less common for men to quit them. I know you guys were in it for solidarity but the reality is that it's most likely not going to happen (as it's not happening). I would go easy on yourself and your mate. You are in a stressful time period for multiple reasons. It will get easier for you as time goes on. I don't think criticizing anyone when they are trying to quit get is effective. Reduced usage can lead to quitting.  Encouraging a reduction of usage and allowing special times to break the promise will reduce your stress level as well as your mates. I think you should give your mate some slack. And I think you should find a way to cope with the stress of withdrawal. Maybe parenting classes. Stay focused on your personal goals and realize that you can not control your mate -- only yourself. Keep trying to better your situation. Do not let anyone stop you.", "Yta- you do know you can quit on your own without someone else doing it with you , right ??\n\nYour husband probably only agreed to quit with you because he knew you were the type to get mad when you couldn\u2019t smoke and he could.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t do it , then you can\u2019t either \u201c mentality is selfish.", "Oh damn. I don't know if I could quit cussing. Oof.", "I'd be more worried about the attitude than the secondhand smoke. Once your baby is born, it'll be \"I didn't give birth, why should I pick her up from daycare,\" not to mention he'll be too blazed to help during the first couple months with nights. Weed got such a bad stigma because of people like him reinforcing how awful people can be to deal with while high. I love edibles, but I know I'm not doing anything productive on them.", "My point still stands I\u2019m just more confused now \ud83d\ude02", "I don't believe her", "Who said anything about \"can't\"?", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of being in certain places. this isn\u2019t like a recovering alcoholic going to a bar. \n\neven if the brother was smoking, OP\u2019s partner didn\u2019t have to. he could\u2019ve said no thank you, and explained he was refraining out of solidarity for OP. any decent person would be understanding of that and not press the issue or try to persuade him to smoke anyways.", "Really not that confusing bud", "Are you even aware of how bad drugs are for the child??", "OP is fine with that. The issue is that he had two bong hits across a visit to family, which is not a thing that indicates an issue with drug use. \n\nOP needs to own her sobriety. Blaming her boyfriend for lack of support isn't going to help her not drink or smoke during pregnancy. If she's going to smoke because her partner smoked, that's 100% on her.", "His actions", "K my bad bud.", "Ok? So you agree, this is a thing she needs to do. Sure sounds like it's her responsibility then!", "No, it isn't. I get that black & white pronouncements are nice & tidy, but it is absolutely fine to go back on your word on some things. \n\nLike, jumping to comparing this to cheating is just unhinged.", "I ate a sandwich for lunch. Does that mean I \"can't\" stop eating sandwiches, or that I chose to eat a sandwich? \n\n\"smoking weed twice\" is not the actions of someone who can't quit smoking weed. If he was smoking daily, that's different. His alcohol intake is more concerning, but OP is fine with that, so that's not at issue here.", "I don\u2019t think that equates this. Your argument is \u201cyou ate\u201d which is a necessity to, you know, live. Her argument is \u201che smoked\u201d, not a necessity.\n\nGoing sober for a long period of time is, I\u2019d imagine, difficult. Even more so when pregnant and stressed from pregnancy things. And *even more so* when your partner you live with offered the pact in the first place to make things easier and goes back on it. Also, he was already drinking, which was his inch. The \u201csmoking with his brother\u201d was him beginning to make it a mile. \n\nIt\u2019s like offering someone with a healing broken leg a crutch and then snatching it away because \u201cthey don\u2019t need to help you\u201d.  Not so much about condemning the thing itself but the invalidating agreement of support that was made by him in the first place. Very asshole behavior.", "You don't need to eat sandwiches to survive. Again, nothing in the information given indicates \"can't\"."]}
