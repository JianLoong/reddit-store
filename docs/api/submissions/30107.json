I had to buy a car since mine had 330,000 km on it and the engine issue was worth fixing. After that I had couple thousand saved and that has been completely wiped out and now I\u2019m not able to cover all my expenses. I asked my gf to help cover my expenses and she has refused because I didn\u2019t propose before this. We had been dating for 3 years and moved in for 2. \n\nShe had told me 3 dates in she expected to be engaged in about 2 years of dating and is very unhappy with me because I didn\u2019t propose. I\u2019m sure she is the one, I\u2019m just still hesitant about marriage and she has told me she is trying to get over the fact she wasted 3 years with me. I told her to give me some time and she has thankfully not pushed it. This was shortly before my work announced they were cutting people and I was let go. \n\nNow she says I\u2019m expecting too much from her since I\u2019m not ready for marriage but expecting her to help me with rent. We have been dating for 3 years doesn\u2019t that count for something?! If it was a year in I understand if it was too early but we have been together for a long time. But she told it was meaningless because I haven\u2019t proposed and she refuses to help me as I could just decide I don\u2019t want marriage and bail at any time. I could have bailed at anytime while dating and still can bail after we get engaged but I didn\u2019t and I won\u2019t. We have been serious for a long time, why is the ring and marriage all that matters?! \n\nI\u2019ve told her since she won\u2019t help it\u2019s shown me she isn\u2019t serious too and she told me it\u2019s fine we can just end the lease and I can go back to live with family if I can\u2019t afford rent here. I\u2019m getting interview requests back and did an interview already although I didn\u2019t get it it\u2019s crazy to me she would waste 3 years over covering a bit more rent and groceries.", "created_utc": 1698849316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ldirs/aita_for_expecting_my_gf_to_support_me_while_im/", "score": 611, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also told you her expectation pretty early. If you knew you couldn't meet it, why did you continue with the relationship? OR at least have a conversation about it when it hit the 2 year mark?", "YTA -- well, well, well, how the turn tables! She told you her terms for a more committed relationship and you've refused them. She has continued your relationship, but has adjusted her expectations and contributions accordingly.\n\nWhy should she change them because suddenly you need the benefits of a more committed relationship, but aren't willing to actually make the commitment? This is the epitome of expecting \"wife duties for girlfriend wages.\"", "YTA, you don't know if you want to marry her but you expect her to act like a wife and cover your expenses when you're unemployed. Make it make sense.", "You\u2019re expecting her to treat you like a husband while you treat her like a girlfriend. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nY'all are a fucking train wreck. If you live together and she doesn't help cover your portion of the rent, doesn't that also mean she will be evicted? Seems like an inconvenient hill to die on.\n\nThat being said, your bills are your responsibility. If you weren't living together, she would have zero responsibility to cover you. As impractical as a \"2-year-mark proposal\" is, she was up-front about it and her desire to get married. And I can see from her perspective that it just doesn't feel like you're committed to her so why should she invest her hard-earned money into you at this point? You're expecting everything without giving anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We have been serious for a long time, why is the ring and marriage all that matter?!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from here. This stuff matters very little to me - but, for that reason, I didn't date people who had a \"walk down the aisle\" goal. You can't hold her desire to get married against her when you went into this KNOWING that was her goal. That's on you. Seems like you went into this not taking her deadline seriously or thinking she'd changed her mind, now being all \"Well, shucks\" when you're faced with the reality she wasn't playing around. What did you expect?", "Yta.  Your expenses are your responsibility.  4 months is plenty of time to find a job.  She wants a partner and you want to be a mooch.  You're threatening to send the relationship because she won't pull your weight too.  It's clear who is invested and it's not you.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou're wanting to have your cake and eat it too.   You're getting all the perks of being married with none of the security or teamwork for her.  THAT is why she mentioned the marriage thing.  She's being expected to carry you but you're not in it for the long haul.  \n\n\nGet an interim job.  There has got to be a McDonald's or the like somewhere nearby that  you can supplement your UE with.  I don't know about where you live but you can usually make up to a certain amount without it cutting into your UE.    \n\n\nAct like a grown up and pull your own weight.", "YTA- you expect her to take on the responsibilities of taking care of you, while also telling her that you aren\u2019t sure you want a full commitment with her. Why on earth would she pay for you knowing you haven\u2019t decided to stay with her. She\u2019s smart. Too many people take on the expenses of a partner with no recourse when the relationship ends. Don\u2019t propose now just for the money, that would be a disaster of an idea.", "Lol. She\u2019s not going to support you if she isn\u2019t married to you. I think it\u2019s funny you BOUGHT A CAR whilst unemployed and then expect her to cover your bills. \nYTA", "YTA. She knows her worth and has always told you her marriage goal, and you ignored it. \n\nAnd the fact she has a plan that she can just move in with her parents means she might have been considering that already. You wanting her to support you may have been the last straw.", "YTA. She is indeed correct. There is a difference between being involved and being engaged. Moving to engaged means there is at least a promise of marriage versus we live together. Especially since she made it clear upfront she wants marriage. If you\u2019re so sure, why are you hesitant? Why haven\u2019t you gotten even something minimum wage? Most McDonald\u2019s hire anyone. She is completely right. You need to show your intentions. I would never cover expenses for a man I wasn\u2019t at least engaged and planning the wedding with. Especially after four months of unemployment. Find something, ANYTHING, to tide you over until something more your forte comes along. I spent five months working Walmart asset protection while I looked around for my current position. Did I like it? No. Did it pay the bills so I didn\u2019t become homeless? Yes. And I worked 40hr/week and still made time to find a new job that I liked better.", "YTA. She set pretty basic ground rules... You could have lied and just hit it and quit it or see the plan through. You didn't pick either. But now that you need something, you base marriage on the fact that she isn't willing to support you? She invest time. You want her to invest time and money on something that isn't showing a return.", "YTA. You're expecting a lot out of someone that you're hesitant to marry after three years. You have family to go live with, so you should do that.", "INFO\n\nDid you pay for her expenses while you were employed?", "YTA\n\n>Now she says I\u2019m expecting too much from her since I\u2019m not ready for marriage but expecting her to help me with rent.\n\nYes. She is right. You also say:\n\n>I\u2019m sure she is the one, I\u2019m just still hesitant about marriage\n\nThat doesn't make sense. If you are hesitant about marriage, then you aren't sure. You need to look inward and figure out what your real feelings are here. \n\nShe has made her expectations clear. And 4 months not working? Why didn't you pick up a retail or customer service job in the meantime while you were looking? Why did you even buy another car?? You should be relying on transit and working for minimum wage while you find something better if you are so broke. \n\nIt sucks to be laid off but it sounds like you are playing the victim here and as a woman I'd be very disappointed by your lack of responsibility.", "This is literally expecting the milk for free but refusing the buy the cow. \n\nOnly you also can\u2019t buy the cow, and expect someone to throw in some ice cream and other bonuses.\n\nIt\u2019s a crappy analogy, but the point is that if you aren\u2019t willing to fully commit in the way she expressed needing, it\u2019s within her right not to fulfill the benefits a marriage would offer.\n\nYTA", "YTA. She was very clear about her goals and expectations and you don\u2019t think they matter. You need to give her the respect of either giving her what she wants (happily, without resentment ) or letting her go find someone who will. \n\nI absolutely understand why she won\u2019t give you money- you have clearly shown that her needs and goals are not important to you, that your timeline is the only one you care about, and your needs are all you care about. I would never, ever financially entangle myself with someone who wasn\u2019t willing to commit to me, and I\u2019m guessing this is how your girlfriend feels as well. You are not married- she doesn\u2019t need to help you in any way, and she shouldn\u2019t, given that you have proven unreliable about commitment and she\u2019d have absolutely no protection or ability to get her money back if you flake. \n\nYou don\u2019t understand why marriage matters, so this tells me she should absolutely move on and find someone whose values are more closely aligned with hers. You are dismissing something that is clearly very important to her, refusing to attempt to understand WHY it\u2019s important, and then mad that she won\u2019t bend over backwards for you.", "YTA.  You are not sure you are ready for marriage yet you want her to act like your wife and pay your bills.  She isn't wasting 3 years \"over covering a bit more rent and groceries\"; she has wasted 3 years on you and her expectations of you.  \n\nIt is time for her to move on with her life and shed the dead weight that is you.", "You\u2019re the asshole, if you aren\u2019t committed enough to get married you shouldn\u2019t expect her to be committed enough to pay your bills.", "This woman is not pissing around. She wants commitment, and these are the consequences of not being committed to her, not the other way around. You missed your chance, someone with this much self worth and confidence isn\u2019t going to wait for you to pull head from ass. Good luck with your job and apartment search.", "YTA \n\nI think it\u2019s the way you said it. You want her to cover you instead of loaning the money to you, which you\u2019ll pay back.\n\nYou are a grown adult who should have saved more for a rainy day. It\u2019s not her job to cover you cos you two are not married. That was her point and you missed it. Sure, you could say the car breaking down wasn\u2019t something expected. IDK how old you are but from the sounds of it, you should really learn to manage your finances.", "So you\u2019re not ready to marry her but you expect her to support you? What\u2019s logic is that? YTA", "You\u2019re asking for Husband Level perks while on the Boyfriend Package. YTA", "YTA\n\n>We have been serious for a long time, why is the ring and marriage all that matters?! \n\nWell, it obviously matters to your gf. And you can stop complaing bc she was upfront about this at the 3rd(!!) date. \n\nSo her argument about you not being comitted enough from her pov is valid. For her, only a proposal and marriage shows comittment. If you are not fine with this, you should have addressed it or left a long time ago. \n\nYou are kind of lucky to still have a gf at this point. My former collegue was also very upfront with her bf about getting married, after 4 yrs relationship she gave her guy a 2yrs deadline, reminded him 6 and then 3 months before the deadline that time is running up (and he always assured her not to worry, he is working on it) and after not getting a proposal, she broke up with him 5min after midnight. He was oc pikachu face, but she moved out within a month, blocked him, started dating and a year later is planning her marriage. The ex still tries to get her back till this day.  His claim? Oc he is going to propose, but on his timeline, so maybe in 5, 6 yrs down the road. He took her for granted bc \"she will never leave me, its just a threat\". Yeah, well dude, it wasn't :)  Do i think she is a little nuts? Maybe, but this girl at least has the balls to voice what she needs from her partner and go through with it. Marriage is just more important to her than everything else, even we as her collegues knew this, her ex definitly knew it.", "Yta she is not responsible for you. She is your gf not your wife and certainly not your free bank account.  If you need money take any job you can find.", "YTA, and soon to be a single one.", "YTA so you want wife benefits without the ring and commitment? Lmfao\u2026", "YTA. Your gf was VERY clear that her goal in a relationship is marriage. You are \u201csure she is the one\u201d, but refused to make the level of commitment she desires, and now want her to support you financially. She is right to break up with you.", "YTA. You want wife duties at girlfriend prices. Your inability to pay your rent is your own problem. If she was your wife that\u2019d be a different situation. \n\nFrom her perspective you are a user. Who wants to be used? She already told you before you lost your job that she\u2019s unhappy with the status of your relationship and you have not done anything to remedy that.\n\nHelp you with rent? She has one foot out the door. A woman will tell you exactly what you need to do to make her happy if you don\u2019t listen or won\u2019t act, it\u2019s on you when the relationship ends.", "YTA. \n\nShe told you what she wanted from the start. You don't plan to marry her, obviously, and using her unwillingness to pay for you as a reason to not marry her just highlights that. \n\nYou want wife benefits when you've made it clear through inaction you don't want to marry her. Cause at 3 years you should know, and you clearly *do* know that you don't want marriage. \n\nGo back to your parents. Yall are done.", "YTA \n\nWhy did you buy a car but you didn\u2019t have a job?  You\u2019re not sure about marrying her but what her to cover you? I mean you\u2019re not making any sense", "YTA - She is done with you. This is her opportunity to throw you out get her life back. If you wanted to marry her you would know. If you didn't figure it out in the first year of living together, the answer to the question of do you want to marry her is no.\n\nIf you were a fiance or a husband, this would be different, she would have known that the two of you were in this for life, and stuck by your side as your life partner. Right now you are someone she is dating/a roommate, and if you can't pull your weight, she has no reason to stay with you.", "This hurts my head. Yta and either cut it off or marry her, but man at this point she should run. She has such a fair point seeing as you're not even married and you're having financial issues you expect her to fix.", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019ve been living together for two years, and don\u2019t know if you want to marry her, then you don\u2019t want to marry her. \n\nYou have to shit or get off the pot.\n\nYou haven\u2019t given her the type of partnership she wants. You are the classic example of wanting your cake while at the same time eating it too.\n\nSounds more like you want a mommy.", "YTA\n\nShe's not good enough to be a wife but good enough to pay your bills?", "YTA\n\nShe was very clear on her expectations from the beginning. If she's the one and you know it, then just propose. PLUS you've been out of work for 4 months, plenty of time to at least have a little part time job. But you want her to help someone who won't help himself. Oh, sorry. You want to mooch off her till she gets fed up with your low-commitment ass and leaves", "YTA, not because you asked for help in the first place but because you're being dismissive of the underlying concerns she has in giving you money. And it looks like you're trying to flip the script on her a bit which isn't fair. She's worried you're using her so stop feeding that impression. \n\nIf you are actually serious about her I would apologize and tell her you are going to handle your situation independently, and that you hope she will be open to talking about marriage once you're employed again and don't have this issue hanging over the conversation.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t owe you shared finances until she has legal protections behind those shared finances.", "YTA.  Seriously - go hit the employment agency.", "YTA.\n\nShe told you she expected younto commit. You told her you need time and she didn't pressure you although she already felt like she wasted years of her life with you if you are unwilling to commit. \n\n*Now*, when it is convenient for *you* because you want financial help from her you tell her *she* is the one showing no interest in commitment.", "I'd work the lowest, shittiest job on the planet before I would expect someone to carry my weight.\n\nTotally, YTA.\n\nOh, BTW... The ring and marriage shows commitment, and that symbol is important to some people.", "Don't get married if you're not ready. But its also not her job to support you unless you've supported her in the past.", "You obviously are not ready for a real, adult commitment yet you expect her to support you? Nope, I would leave too, she can\u2019t trust you and I don\u2019t blame her.", "YTA.  OP let's break this down easily.\n\nYou think getting married after 3 years is too much commitment. But you want her to financially support your entirely while you have no job?  What benefits is she getting?  You hold all the cards at that point and are just actually a terrible partner. You ignore her very clear expectations for your convenience.  Then you want her money.\n\nAlso you aren't employeed for 4 months.  Why?  Did you not consider getting a crappy job elsewhere temporarily?  Like it sucks but your gf is not your safety net.", "YTA. Your expenses are not her responsibility. She was clear with her expectations about the relationship and wanting to be engaged. You won't propose even though you say she's the one, but you want her to foot your bills? It's no wonder she is hesitant to help you.", "YTA... you've been off work for 3 months? Why dont you have another job? Any job? \nMy husbands employment went bankrupt- he got a job cleaning toilets part time while looking for his new career. Part time supplemented EI and allowed him time for interviews and putting out resumes.  It took 6 months to find the work in his field that was what he wanted. Meanwhile toilets were cleaned.", "YTA", "YTA, so you\u2019re not ready for marriage because of the \u201cwhat if\u201d but want that same women to support you for a indefinite time? Why does the 3 years only matter when it benefits you directly? The relationship is obviously over thankfully", "LMAO YTA and your girlfriend is a smart woman. I expect she will just break up with you soon enough since you can\u2019t get your shit together.  Enjoy moving back home!", "YTA - one interview? And what did you do in the preceding 4 months besides collect unemployment?", "YTA\n\nShe's your GF, not your wife. This isn't a \"let's work it out\" scenario. This is a \"wow, what are you gonna do\" scenario.\n\nAt this point she's a romantic roommate. And from the sound of things she's about to bounce. She let you know she wanted to be married in 2 years. If you weren't about that you shouldn't have dated her. She was operating on good faith that you wanted the same things (otherwise why would she date you). She probably feels lied to and betrayed. \n\nSo get your head on straight and firm up. I suspect things are about to get tough financially and emotionally. Let me just say early on that it will eventually get easier. Don't go blaming others for your situation. Just accept it is what it is and work to make it better.", "yta, you\u2019re grown, get a job, handle your shit", "YTA. your expenses, your responsibility. Your gf made it clear from the start what she wanted and expected from this relationship. She set a boundary and you are stepping all over it.", "Sorry but I wouldn\u2019t cover your bills either.

I wouldn\u2019t pay the bills either is we aren\u2019t at the very least engaged before you lost your job.", "Did you expect anything other than YTA here? Because goddamn. Honestly, good for her for putting her foot down. You\u2019ve been stringing her along long enough and sorry, this is what you get.

She told you what her longterm conditions were, now you have already been dating for waaaay longer\u2026 you didn\u2019t want to commit in any form but are now expecting her to finance your life?

You've shown her you haven't been serious the entire three years yall have been dating, so the fact you'd use that to guilt her is really gross.

Nobody can actually make that promise that soon, and even if you're really willing to try, nobody can guarantee that it will be successful. First you have to spend few years together and see how it goes. Marriage should not be forced, it should come to you naturally when you both feel it's the right time. Relationships are not a planned script. Besides, proposal and marriage means nothing if you really love each other.  \n\n\nBut i have a feeling she's not looking for real love, i think she's just looking for a status. Maybe she's an opportunist and has some use from the marriage, otherwise i don't know why it's so important. It could be money, inheritance, or she wants to have kids and stay home all day while you work provide.. Some women are parasites like that, they want to secure their future by having a sugardaddy. They carefully plan their strategy and tactics, and they're slowly but sneakingly building towards a lazy spoiled life. She's being manipulative and blackmailing you from the start, setting a trap for you.  \n\n\nI completely understand her concern though, i would be worried too if i helped you with money and you bailed because we're not married. But if you really love someone you will help them and trust them they will stay, partners should be there for each other through thick and thin. Things like these are the building blocks towards marriage. I honestly don't think she really loves you if she's not willing to help. And possibly you don't love her that much either, since you're still not sure about marriage after 3 years. But she just seems very shallow, being stingy with money and only thinking about a piece of paper and a ring.  \n\n\nYou could've also found a small job during these 4 months, just to pay the bills. There's always jobs available for those willing to work. So you should also be more responsible for this situation. Besides, even if you wanted to propose her now you cannot buy a ring, and definitely can't afford the wedding. So you need to sort it out my dude. If you really think she's worth it, you need to put effort. But i honestly don't think you're right for each other.
