I had to buy a car since mine had 330,000 km on it and the engine issue was worth fixing. After that I had couple thousand saved and that has been completely wiped out and now I\u2019m not able to cover all my expenses. I asked my gf to help cover my expenses and she has refused because I didn\u2019t propose before this. We had been dating for 3 years and moved in for 2. \n\nShe had told me 3 dates in she expected to be engaged in about 2 years of dating and is very unhappy with me because I didn\u2019t propose. I\u2019m sure she is the one, I\u2019m just still hesitant about marriage and she has told me she is trying to get over the fact she wasted 3 years with me. I told her to give me some time and she has thankfully not pushed it. This was shortly before my work announced they were cutting people and I was let go. \n\nNow she says I\u2019m expecting too much from her since I\u2019m not ready for marriage but expecting her to help me with rent. We have been dating for 3 years doesn\u2019t that count for something?! If it was a year in I understand if it was too early but we have been together for a long time. But she told it was meaningless because I haven\u2019t proposed and she refuses to help me as I could just decide I don\u2019t want marriage and bail at any time. I could have bailed at anytime while dating and still can bail after we get engaged but I didn\u2019t and I won\u2019t. We have been serious for a long time, why is the ring and marriage all that matters?! \n\nI\u2019ve told her since she won\u2019t help it\u2019s shown me she isn\u2019t serious too and she told me it\u2019s fine we can just end the lease and I can go back to live with family if I can\u2019t afford rent here. I\u2019m getting interview requests back and did an interview already although I didn\u2019t get it it\u2019s crazy to me she would waste 3 years over covering a bit more rent and groceries.", "created_utc": 1698849316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ldirs/aita_for_expecting_my_gf_to_support_me_while_im/", "score": 2934, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also told you her expectation pretty early. If you knew you couldn't meet it, why did you continue with the relationship? OR at least have a conversation about it when it hit the 2 year mark?", "YTA -- well, well, well, how the turn tables! She told you her terms for a more committed relationship and you've refused them. She has continued your relationship, but has adjusted her expectations and contributions accordingly.\n\nWhy should she change them because suddenly you need the benefits of a more committed relationship, but aren't willing to actually make the commitment? This is the epitome of expecting \"wife duties for girlfriend wages.\"", "YTA, you don't know if you want to marry her but you expect her to act like a wife and cover your expenses when you're unemployed. Make it make sense.", "You\u2019re expecting her to treat you like a husband while you treat her like a girlfriend. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nY'all are a fucking train wreck. If you live together and she doesn't help cover your portion of the rent, doesn't that also mean she will be evicted? Seems like an inconvenient hill to die on.\n\nThat being said, your bills are your responsibility. If you weren't living together, she would have zero responsibility to cover you. As impractical as a \"2-year-mark proposal\" is, she was up-front about it and her desire to get married. And I can see from her perspective that it just doesn't feel like you're committed to her so why should she invest her hard-earned money into you at this point? You're expecting everything without giving anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We have been serious for a long time, why is the ring and marriage all that matter?!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from here. This stuff matters very little to me - but, for that reason, I didn't date people who had a \"walk down the aisle\" goal. You can't hold her desire to get married against her when you went into this KNOWING that was her goal. That's on you. Seems like you went into this not taking her deadline seriously or thinking she'd changed her mind, now being all \"Well, shucks\" when you're faced with the reality she wasn't playing around. What did you expect?", "Yta.  Your expenses are your responsibility.  4 months is plenty of time to find a job.  She wants a partner and you want to be a mooch.  You're threatening to send the relationship because she won't pull your weight too.  It's clear who is invested and it's not you.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou're wanting to have your cake and eat it too.   You're getting all the perks of being married with none of the security or teamwork for her.  THAT is why she mentioned the marriage thing.  She's being expected to carry you but you're not in it for the long haul.  \n\n\nGet an interim job.  There has got to be a McDonald's or the like somewhere nearby that  you can supplement your UE with.  I don't know about where you live but you can usually make up to a certain amount without it cutting into your UE.    \n\n\nAct like a grown up and pull your own weight.", "YTA- you expect her to take on the responsibilities of taking care of you, while also telling her that you aren\u2019t sure you want a full commitment with her. Why on earth would she pay for you knowing you haven\u2019t decided to stay with her. She\u2019s smart. Too many people take on the expenses of a partner with no recourse when the relationship ends. Don\u2019t propose now just for the money, that would be a disaster of an idea.", "Lol. She\u2019s not going to support you if she isn\u2019t married to you. I think it\u2019s funny you BOUGHT A CAR whilst unemployed and then expect her to cover your bills. \nYTA", "YTA. She knows her worth and has always told you her marriage goal, and you ignored it. \n\nAnd the fact she has a plan that she can just move in with her parents means she might have been considering that already. You wanting her to support you may have been the last straw.", "YTA. She is indeed correct. There is a difference between being involved and being engaged. Moving to engaged means there is at least a promise of marriage versus we live together. Especially since she made it clear upfront she wants marriage. If you\u2019re so sure, why are you hesitant? Why haven\u2019t you gotten even something minimum wage? Most McDonald\u2019s hire anyone. She is completely right. You need to show your intentions. I would never cover expenses for a man I wasn\u2019t at least engaged and planning the wedding with. Especially after four months of unemployment. Find something, ANYTHING, to tide you over until something more your forte comes along. I spent five months working Walmart asset protection while I looked around for my current position. Did I like it? No. Did it pay the bills so I didn\u2019t become homeless? Yes. And I worked 40hr/week and still made time to find a new job that I liked better.", "YTA. She set pretty basic ground rules... You could have lied and just hit it and quit it or see the plan through. You didn't pick either. But now that you need something, you base marriage on the fact that she isn't willing to support you? She invest time. You want her to invest time and money on something that isn't showing a return.", "YTA. You're expecting a lot out of someone that you're hesitant to marry after three years. You have family to go live with, so you should do that.", "INFO\n\nDid you pay for her expenses while you were employed?", "YTA\n\n>Now she says I\u2019m expecting too much from her since I\u2019m not ready for marriage but expecting her to help me with rent.\n\nYes. She is right. You also say:\n\n>I\u2019m sure she is the one, I\u2019m just still hesitant about marriage\n\nThat doesn't make sense. If you are hesitant about marriage, then you aren't sure. You need to look inward and figure out what your real feelings are here. \n\nShe has made her expectations clear. And 4 months not working? Why didn't you pick up a retail or customer service job in the meantime while you were looking? Why did you even buy another car?? You should be relying on transit and working for minimum wage while you find something better if you are so broke. \n\nIt sucks to be laid off but it sounds like you are playing the victim here and as a woman I'd be very disappointed by your lack of responsibility.", "This is literally expecting the milk for free but refusing the buy the cow. \n\nOnly you also can\u2019t buy the cow, and expect someone to throw in some ice cream and other bonuses.\n\nIt\u2019s a crappy analogy, but the point is that if you aren\u2019t willing to fully commit in the way she expressed needing, it\u2019s within her right not to fulfill the benefits a marriage would offer.\n\nYTA", "YTA. She was very clear about her goals and expectations and you don\u2019t think they matter. You need to give her the respect of either giving her what she wants (happily, without resentment ) or letting her go find someone who will. \n\nI absolutely understand why she won\u2019t give you money- you have clearly shown that her needs and goals are not important to you, that your timeline is the only one you care about, and your needs are all you care about. I would never, ever financially entangle myself with someone who wasn\u2019t willing to commit to me, and I\u2019m guessing this is how your girlfriend feels as well. You are not married- she doesn\u2019t need to help you in any way, and she shouldn\u2019t, given that you have proven unreliable about commitment and she\u2019d have absolutely no protection or ability to get her money back if you flake. \n\nYou don\u2019t understand why marriage matters, so this tells me she should absolutely move on and find someone whose values are more closely aligned with hers. You are dismissing something that is clearly very important to her, refusing to attempt to understand WHY it\u2019s important, and then mad that she won\u2019t bend over backwards for you.", "YTA.  You are not sure you are ready for marriage yet you want her to act like your wife and pay your bills.  She isn't wasting 3 years \"over covering a bit more rent and groceries\"; she has wasted 3 years on you and her expectations of you.  \n\nIt is time for her to move on with her life and shed the dead weight that is you.", "You\u2019re the asshole, if you aren\u2019t committed enough to get married you shouldn\u2019t expect her to be committed enough to pay your bills.", "This woman is not pissing around. She wants commitment, and these are the consequences of not being committed to her, not the other way around. You missed your chance, someone with this much self worth and confidence isn\u2019t going to wait for you to pull head from ass. Good luck with your job and apartment search.", "YTA \n\nI think it\u2019s the way you said it. You want her to cover you instead of loaning the money to you, which you\u2019ll pay back.\n\nYou are a grown adult who should have saved more for a rainy day. It\u2019s not her job to cover you cos you two are not married. That was her point and you missed it. Sure, you could say the car breaking down wasn\u2019t something expected. IDK how old you are but from the sounds of it, you should really learn to manage your finances.", "So you\u2019re not ready to marry her but you expect her to support you? What\u2019s logic is that? YTA", "You\u2019re asking for Husband Level perks while on the Boyfriend Package. YTA", "YTA\n\n>We have been serious for a long time, why is the ring and marriage all that matters?! \n\nWell, it obviously matters to your gf. And you can stop complaing bc she was upfront about this at the 3rd(!!) date. \n\nSo her argument about you not being comitted enough from her pov is valid. For her, only a proposal and marriage shows comittment. If you are not fine with this, you should have addressed it or left a long time ago. \n\nYou are kind of lucky to still have a gf at this point. My former collegue was also very upfront with her bf about getting married, after 4 yrs relationship she gave her guy a 2yrs deadline, reminded him 6 and then 3 months before the deadline that time is running up (and he always assured her not to worry, he is working on it) and after not getting a proposal, she broke up with him 5min after midnight. He was oc pikachu face, but she moved out within a month, blocked him, started dating and a year later is planning her marriage. The ex still tries to get her back till this day.  His claim? Oc he is going to propose, but on his timeline, so maybe in 5, 6 yrs down the road. He took her for granted bc \"she will never leave me, its just a threat\". Yeah, well dude, it wasn't :)  Do i think she is a little nuts? Maybe, but this girl at least has the balls to voice what she needs from her partner and go through with it. Marriage is just more important to her than everything else, even we as her collegues knew this, her ex definitly knew it.", "Yta she is not responsible for you. She is your gf not your wife and certainly not your free bank account.  If you need money take any job you can find.", "YTA, and soon to be a single one.", "YTA so you want wife benefits without the ring and commitment? Lmfao\u2026", "YTA. Your gf was VERY clear that her goal in a relationship is marriage. You are \u201csure she is the one\u201d, but refused to make the level of commitment she desires, and now want her to support you financially. She is right to break up with you.", "YTA. You want wife duties at girlfriend prices. Your inability to pay your rent is your own problem. If she was your wife that\u2019d be a different situation. \n\nFrom her perspective you are a user. Who wants to be used? She already told you before you lost your job that she\u2019s unhappy with the status of your relationship and you have not done anything to remedy that.\n\nHelp you with rent? She has one foot out the door. A woman will tell you exactly what you need to do to make her happy if you don\u2019t listen or won\u2019t act, it\u2019s on you when the relationship ends.", "YTA. \n\nShe told you what she wanted from the start. You don't plan to marry her, obviously, and using her unwillingness to pay for you as a reason to not marry her just highlights that. \n\nYou want wife benefits when you've made it clear through inaction you don't want to marry her. Cause at 3 years you should know, and you clearly *do* know that you don't want marriage. \n\nGo back to your parents. Yall are done.", "YTA \n\nWhy did you buy a car but you didn\u2019t have a job?  You\u2019re not sure about marrying her but what her to cover you? I mean you\u2019re not making any sense", "YTA - She is done with you. This is her opportunity to throw you out get her life back. If you wanted to marry her you would know. If you didn't figure it out in the first year of living together, the answer to the question of do you want to marry her is no.\n\nIf you were a fiance or a husband, this would be different, she would have known that the two of you were in this for life, and stuck by your side as your life partner. Right now you are someone she is dating/a roommate, and if you can't pull your weight, she has no reason to stay with you.", "This hurts my head. Yta and either cut it off or marry her, but man at this point she should run. She has such a fair point seeing as you're not even married and you're having financial issues you expect her to fix.", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019ve been living together for two years, and don\u2019t know if you want to marry her, then you don\u2019t want to marry her. \n\nYou have to shit or get off the pot.\n\nYou haven\u2019t given her the type of partnership she wants. You are the classic example of wanting your cake while at the same time eating it too.\n\nSounds more like you want a mommy.", "YTA\n\nShe's not good enough to be a wife but good enough to pay your bills?", "YTA\n\nShe was very clear on her expectations from the beginning. If she's the one and you know it, then just propose. PLUS you've been out of work for 4 months, plenty of time to at least have a little part time job. But you want her to help someone who won't help himself. Oh, sorry. You want to mooch off her till she gets fed up with your low-commitment ass and leaves", "YTA, not because you asked for help in the first place but because you're being dismissive of the underlying concerns she has in giving you money. And it looks like you're trying to flip the script on her a bit which isn't fair. She's worried you're using her so stop feeding that impression. \n\nIf you are actually serious about her I would apologize and tell her you are going to handle your situation independently, and that you hope she will be open to talking about marriage once you're employed again and don't have this issue hanging over the conversation.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t owe you shared finances until she has legal protections behind those shared finances.", "YTA.  Seriously - go hit the employment agency.", "YTA.\n\nShe told you she expected younto commit. You told her you need time and she didn't pressure you although she already felt like she wasted years of her life with you if you are unwilling to commit. \n\n*Now*, when it is convenient for *you* because you want financial help from her you tell her *she* is the one showing no interest in commitment.", "I'd work the lowest, shittiest job on the planet before I would expect someone to carry my weight.\n\nTotally, YTA.\n\nOh, BTW... The ring and marriage shows commitment, and that symbol is important to some people.", "Don't get married if you're not ready. But its also not her job to support you unless you've supported her in the past.", "You obviously are not ready for a real, adult commitment yet you expect her to support you? Nope, I would leave too, she can\u2019t trust you and I don\u2019t blame her.", "YTA.  OP let's break this down easily.\n\nYou think getting married after 3 years is too much commitment. But you want her to financially support your entirely while you have no job?  What benefits is she getting?  You hold all the cards at that point and are just actually a terrible partner. You ignore her very clear expectations for your convenience.  Then you want her money.\n\nAlso you aren't employeed for 4 months.  Why?  Did you not consider getting a crappy job elsewhere temporarily?  Like it sucks but your gf is not your safety net.", "YTA. Your expenses are not her responsibility. She was clear with her expectations about the relationship and wanting to be engaged. You won't propose even though you say she's the one, but you want her to foot your bills? It's no wonder she is hesitant to help you.", "YTA... you've been off work for 3 months? Why dont you have another job? Any job? \nMy husbands employment went bankrupt- he got a job cleaning toilets part time while looking for his new career. Part time supplemented EI and allowed him time for interviews and putting out resumes.  It took 6 months to find the work in his field that was what he wanted. Meanwhile toilets were cleaned.", "YTA", "YTA, so you\u2019re not ready for marriage because of the \u201cwhat if\u201d but want that same women to support you for a indefinite time? Why does the 3 years only matter when it benefits you directly? The relationship is obviously over thankfully", "LMAO YTA and your girlfriend is a smart woman. I expect she will just break up with you soon enough since you can\u2019t get your shit together.  Enjoy moving back home!", "YTA - one interview? And what did you do in the preceding 4 months besides collect unemployment?", "YTA\n\nShe's your GF, not your wife. This isn't a \"let's work it out\" scenario. This is a \"wow, what are you gonna do\" scenario.\n\nAt this point she's a romantic roommate. And from the sound of things she's about to bounce. She let you know she wanted to be married in 2 years. If you weren't about that you shouldn't have dated her. She was operating on good faith that you wanted the same things (otherwise why would she date you). She probably feels lied to and betrayed. \n\nSo get your head on straight and firm up. I suspect things are about to get tough financially and emotionally. Let me just say early on that it will eventually get easier. Don't go blaming others for your situation. Just accept it is what it is and work to make it better.", "yta, you\u2019re grown, get a job, handle your shit", "YTA. your expenses, your responsibility. Your gf made it clear from the start what she wanted and expected from this relationship. She set a boundary and you are stepping all over it.", "Sorry but I wouldn\u2019t cover your bills either.

I wouldn\u2019t pay the bills either is we aren\u2019t at the very least engaged before you lost your job.", "Did you expect anything other than YTA here? Because goddamn. Honestly, good for her for putting her foot down. You\u2019ve been stringing her along long enough and sorry, this is what you get.

She told you what her longterm conditions were, now you have already been dating for waaaay longer\u2026 you didn\u2019t want to commit in any form but are now expecting her to finance your life?

You've shown her you haven't been serious the entire three years yall have been dating, so the fact you'd use that to guilt her is really gross.

Nobody can actually make that promise that soon, and even if you're really willing to try, nobody can guarantee that it will be successful. First you have to spend few years together and see how it goes. Marriage should not be forced, it should come to you naturally when you both feel it's the right time. Relationships are not a planned script. Besides, proposal and marriage means nothing if you really love each other.  \n\n\nBut i have a feeling she's not looking for real love, i think she's just looking for a status. Maybe she's an opportunist and has some use from the marriage, otherwise i don't know why it's so important. It could be money, inheritance, or she wants to have kids and stay home all day while you work provide.. Some women are parasites like that, they want to secure their future by having a sugardaddy. They carefully plan their strategy and tactics, and they're slowly but sneakingly building towards a lazy spoiled life. She's being manipulative and blackmailing you from the start, setting a trap for you.  \n\n\nI completely understand her concern though, i would be worried too if i helped you with money and you bailed because we're not married. But if you really love someone you will help them and trust them they will stay, partners should be there for each other through thick and thin. Things like these are the building blocks towards marriage. I honestly don't think she really loves you if she's not willing to help. And possibly you don't love her that much either, since you're still not sure about marriage after 3 years. But she just seems very shallow, being stingy with money and only thinking about a piece of paper and a ring.  \n\n\nYou could've also found a small job during these 4 months, just to pay the bills. There's always jobs available for those willing to work. So you should also be more responsible for this situation. Besides, even if you wanted to propose her now you cannot buy a ring, and definitely can't afford the wedding. So you need to sort it out my dude. If you really think she's worth it, you need to put effort. But i honestly don't think you're right for each other.

Especially in the case of women, if you want kids and want to be married before having them, you don't have forever to wait anymore.  If you're not with the person you're going to start your family with, you need to know if you need to go to have enough time to meet someone else, fall in love, get engaged, get married, have some time alone as newlyweds before kids enter the equation and then finally start family planning.

It doesn\u2019t matter as much where it comes from, so there\u2019s incentive to support the household not just yourselves. \n\nThere are plenty of people on committed long term relationships who run their house that way too which I think is perfectly fine. But there aren\u2019t really any legal protections for them unless they have contracts etc. \n\nI OP said that his gf is afraid he\u2019s going to take her money for months, eventually get a new job, then dump her and never pay her back. I think given his fear of commitment, their conflict between them on a marriage timeline, and their month to month lease, it\u2019s not an unfounded fear. At least if their lease was committed he couldn\u2019t leave as easily lol", "How can she resist such romance!! Lol", "He's too cheap to buy her a ring. He's so cheap to expect his roommate to cover his rent.", "(He doesn\u2019t want to ever get married but doesn\u2019t want her to break up with him)\n\nWhat a charmer", "Which explains quite clearly why she's not enthusiastic about covering his bills. She's already checked out.", "Seems like OP only has decided that the relationship is over now that his GF isn't putting anything more into the relationship especially financially. If she did I'm pretty sure he'd be happy with the status quo even though she's unhappy.", "She said she wasted three years with the guy. If that isn\u2019t pulling a ripcord I don\u2019t know what is.", "He wants to stay now because he wants her to pay his bills. She should run.", "Funny how a legally binding lease will do that", "Absolutely. He doesnt really want to get married and she\u2019s not prepared to pay for a couple of bills for him - best to just accept it\u2019s done at that point but neither of them seem to be prepared to admit it.", "Sounds like he doesn't want it to be over because he wants her to float him lol", "He would have won if he appreciated his girlfriend more or found another job so he didn't have to rely on her financially. He wants Husband benefits, but he's still on the Boyfriend plan.", "yes there's no winning, because he asked his girlfriend who he hasn't committed to yet to pay his bills. \n\n\nmaybe i missed it. did OP say why they couldn't find a job?", "Which is why you figure this shit out before the hard stuff happens.", "unless he gets a job quick", "Agree with FitBook - I've seen too many of my friends get d\\*cked around by romantic partners that wouldn't commit and kept whiffle-waffling around.... that seed of indecision inevitably crept into other areas of their relationship(s) and I never saw it end well.\n\nSo I have respect for people who are honest and upfront about looking for that level of commitment and who come out and make it clear that they won't wait around years and years for the other person to decide.", "I would have thought a marriage time limit silly in my youth, but having been fucked around by a guy nodding passively for over a decade and potentially fucking my chances of having a family, I think it's smart.", "I believe that is a hobosexual move.", "LOL @\u201cplease be by Valentine\u201d\ud83d\ude02", "Look. If you don\u2019t know that you are serious about a person and can\u2019t see yourself committing and marrying this person after 2 years you\u2019ve got problems. Why are you dating this person? You can not want to get married but after 2 years you should know one way or the other if they are marriage material. \n\nShe was upfront about her expectations and he knew that. Her big mistake was moving in with him without a commitment (engagement ring) and not following through and ending things when it was clear he wasn\u2019t interested in marrying her. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s done with him now though. Good for her. If she wants a husband she shouldn\u2019t waste her time on the OP.", "*No Scrubs overlay increases in volume*", "That's my thing too! She isn't wrong to have desires or timelines, but she also sat back when the 2 year mark passed.\n\nI would've been devastated as OP", "They aren\u2019t chained together. They have no legal obligations to each other. She\u2019s allowed to leave him to sink if she wants because that\u2019s how uncommitted relationships work.\n\nFWIW, I refused marriage and was in a long-term relationship without legal obligations and we ended up helping each other through things like this. \n\nWe were both fully on board with it.

Setting a deadline for proposal, way to kill romance. Also, one might think that love would be more important to her than a ring, but apparently, the jewellery is the important part. And not helping someone you supposedly love? I mean, I'd do that type of thing for a friend. It doesn't even have to be my partner. I think any sane person would.\nNTA, she's toxic.", "Allow me to jump in.\n\nLots of young people who get married are poor, uneducated, and honestly not ready for marriage yet.\n\nThis usually leads to an early pregnancy before either partner can actually solidify some stability in their lives. So then it's a constant game of catch up and delaying your personal aspirations and dreams to keep up with each new life change.\n\nNext thing you know it's 10 years later and there's growing resentment because the couple only had the resources and time to have 1 partner follow their dreams.\n\nYou may be an outlier, but its fairly common for people who aren't ready and in no stable shape to be married, rush into it, which starts the marriage on a shaky foundation to begin with.\n\nOne of the #1 stressor on a marriage are financial issues.\n\nIt makes sense to get that in a row before you both meld your lives together.", "Yup she probably was going to leave but now feels bad because the bf is broke and dependant on her to keep his standard of life", "This is my impression as well. It\u2019s been a year, she\u2019s tried to talk to him about it, but \u201cthankfully backed off\u201d.

Only one interview at 4 months of unemployment? Sounds like he just expected her to cover for him.", "I got laid off in March, have applied to roughly 600 jobs, did at least a screening interview at a bit over 100, and I still haven't managed to get a single offer. Depending on your field/experience/skillset, the market could be terrible right now. I'm single and had fairly substantial savings so I covered everything up until my lease was over and I moved back in with my parents, but if someone is trying to find a job but is struggling right now I can't blame them.", "Yes!!  I understand the wedding bells are not for everyone, but his girlfriend was upfront.  OP, you snoozed and you lost.  She told you two years and it has been three, you said you think she is the one, what is the hold up?  Don't ask now, it's too late.  Now you will have to get a job and pull yourself back up, and it will still be too late.  (probably)\n\nYTA", "Some people don't care about marriage and that is fine. But for people who do two years is long enough to make up your mind and an ultimatum is fine.

They can't get pregnant outside marriage? They can't grow resentful outside marriage? If they're so poorly educated why are they somehow able to keep from getting pregnant as long as they don't get married?\n\nI've had friends who waited for different reasons, I guess I'm just struggling with some of the ideas people have here about what happens when a couple gets married.\n\nI think we've all known people who didn't get married, or plan on it, and the exact same things happen to them as the things you're talking about.\n\nThere are a lot of social, cultural and even religious reasons for partnership or marriage to look a specific way. I'm just finding it hard to comprehend some of the reasons given here, since they fall outside the zone of what I've typically heard of seen over the years (reasons that appeared more thought-out, with very specific reasons for delaying) whereas the ones presented here seem to have more to do with the perception of what marriage does or doesn't do.\n\nAnd just to be very clear, I'm talking very specifically about people who say \"i knew they were the one\" but then posit the reasons given in this particular comment thread.", "Honestly, not even her problem lmao. That's a him problem.\n\nIf they were married, it'd be a different story, but otherwise, nah.

I do agree that when savings run out it's tme to take any job while still trying to find a career, but if the GF was serious about the relationship (either of them really) then she could have said \"you get any job and contribute what you can and i will make up the rest\" and give him  reasonable time frame to find any job.", "Eh, depends on the industry. If dude's trying to go work a customer service job for something in the meantime (retail, etc), yeah I doubt he's putting in much work.\n\nSpecialized fields like software engineering or something in Tech/medical/etc? Yeah I could see this being a standard return, or even 0 interviews in 4 months.\n\nNo point in really speculating though since we don't have numbers of OP's applications in those 4 months.

IT TOOK ME AN ENTIRE YEAR to get my new job. I even had consultations at hiring companies for assistance. The job market right now is shit because companies are filtering through their applications using AI that pings for X amount of \"key words\" but those words are a mystery! So unless you literally change your resume every single time you submit an application and somehow manage to figure out what key words they are looking for 9 out of 10 applications are never seen by actual people because if they don't pass the AI filter they get essentially thrown out. So it's possible OP is actively trying to find a job and just having shitty luck.

If you truly accept this as a standard for beginning the relationship... At that point I don't see much difference between proposing on the 2nd date and waiting the 2 years to propose.", "Which is exactly what she's saying. He doesn't want to make the commitment but expects her to give him money.

Since there's no indication he is doing that, his effort seems to be lacking. He should not be acting entitled to his girlfriend paying when he won't commit.
