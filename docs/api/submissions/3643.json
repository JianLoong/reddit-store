Exempt workers are *often* paid salaries, non-exempt are *often* paid hourly, but whether someone is a salaried worker or an hourly wage earner is irrelevant to whether they are appropriately classified as exempt or non-exempt.\n\nIn order to qualify as an exempt employee, you need to earn above a certain threshold AND have a fair degree of control over your schedule and responsibilities. I would be shocked if OP counts as an exempt employee based on the clear micromanagement of their schedule."]}
