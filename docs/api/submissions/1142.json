It's not your fault your step sons mom can't handle her other child and instead chose to parentify the younger brother. It is not his responsibility to regulate his siblings emotions.", "NTA\n\nYour stepson has two brothers, your son, and his mother's other son. It seems a bit unfair to me that he hasn't spent time with his dad for Christmas for so long. It's really sad.\n\nI can also totally understand why he's nagging his mom - he's seen what Christmas with you would look like, and he wants to experience that as well.\n\nI hope all works out, and that you, your son, your ex, and your stepson will have a very Merry Christmas.", "NTA \n\nYou just asked him if he's like to stay for Christmas day and then he went and asked him Mum for permission. That's 100% ok and a reasonable request. Also not the AH for not giving in to her ridiculous request of lying. \n\nHis mother however, is the AH, because she's basically neglecting the needs of one of her sons for the needs of the other, which is child abuse. Both of her sons deserve to have their needs met and the son you invited over, deserves to spend Christmas with his father. \n\nShe needs to find a better way of keeping her other sons emotions stable that doesn't involve sacrificing the needs of her other child.", "NTA- I think you aren't wrong at all for offering him to stay with y'all. If the mother of him doesn't want that she can tell him that but shouldn't go off on you.", "NTA\n\nYou said it best, he's at the age where he can make his own decisions. He chose you.", " It would be best if you talked to his mother first, and could come up with an amicable solution for everyone. But of course you're not going to tell your step son he's not welcome. That would not only be untrue, but immeasurably cruel. You're 100% NTA.\n\nAlso, it's not the son's job to regulate his brother's emotions.\n\nFinally, i seems odd to me that you're communicating with your step son's mother. That should be your ex's role", "NTA. This sounds really complicated, because it isn't the step son's job to help regulate the older son's moods. It is on the mom to help him learn coping mechanisms for the autistic son. If the kid really wants to spend Christmas with y'all, he should be able to, but it isn't always that easy. I'm really sorry you're struggling with this, but you're not the AH at all.", "YTA\nyou caused the kid a shit ton of grief, knowing his mom wasn't going to allow it.

The default is to alternate holidays each year, but you could make a different agreement.\n\nIn my case I decided to have my kids every Christmas Eve (6pm on Dec 23 to 6pm Dec 24) and allow them to be with their mother every Christmas Day.  We  did everything the same but 24 hours early.  This was better for the kids because stability and consistency is very important.\n\nParticularly when you get into blending different families with multiple parenting agreements, it really helps to be flexible with the timing.  Christmas doesn't have to happen on Dec. 25.", "NTA  \n\n\nI don't think it's very healthy that she's using your stepson to \"regulate\" her other child's emotions. I certainly sympathize with ASD but making them co-defendant is not a fucking coping strategy. FFS. God forbid the step son dies in a car accident or something, the child with ASD will be at such a disadvantage.   \n\n\nTrying to back out of this by saying the step son is NOT ALLOWED to go to Dad's house.....is pacifying the ASD child at the expense of the step child thinking dad doesn't WANT him for xmas? WTAF!? This seems very abusive to me.", "ESH.\n\nThe ex for not letting the kid spend Christmas with his father for the past 5 year.\n\nThe father for not fighting to have his kid for the past 5 years for Christmas.\n\nYou for getting involved and getting the autistic kid involved.

Mind your own business next time.", "Maybe I'm alone in this opinion but I think putting up a tree prior to Thanksgiving (end of November for non-Americans from USA) makes people a huge AH.", "Would it be impossible for you to include mom and autistic brother on Christmas Day, and have them all come over while half-brother spends the night?\n\nOr even if he's not allowed to spend the night, have them all over for breakfast and present opening? \n\nNo, it is not your obligation to host this autistic child. yes, they cannot self-regulate. I have a close relative with an autistic child, and it's very isolating because no one invites you anywhere, and your other children become the de facto playmates.\n\nIt would very  much be in the \"Christmas spirit\" to say OK, we will include this autistic child. You can make room at the inn.\n\nMaybe do a test run over Thanksgiving weekend for a little get-together and see how it goes so it's not \"OMG it's Christmas!\"-level and the boy will have seen your house before.", "I think somethings need to be addressed \n\n\n1. Your SS shouldn't be an emotional anchor for his brother (disability or not) \nDad should be fighting SS corner for that.\n\n2. Your a bit of an ass, why didn't you say you would talk to his Dad about it, 10 isn't old enough in most courts to make where to stay choices. \n\n3. Dad and mum need to have a new agreement in regards to Christmas.  Maybe that you and dad have son Christmas Eve until afternoon, one year and the next one Christmas noon until boxing day evening. \n\nOr you say fine we'll keep to the stick to our days no matter what. Example: if the agreement is you have weekends you have everyweekend no matter if it's a holiday or not. \n\n4.

I haven't responded to her texts yet, but my train of thought was to refuse to do as she requests.", "I went back and asked him about this actually. Their agreement was to alternate holidays every single year, but about five years ago when I left my ex, he had a breakdown and ended up in therapy. After this, she went back on their visitation agreement and told him to go back to court, as there's no way he'd be awarded anything other than supervised visitation, so he's terrified to try and reach an agreement within a court.\n\nI've asked him to ring about this schedule and suggest us all spending Christmas together, but he finds its very unlikely that she's inconvenience herself during Christmas by either having guests or being a guest. He doesn't feel like he has any real leverage to oppose her. I will update once he's had the call. I haven't made any contact with her or responded to her messages.\n\nI have in the past showed him resources to make himself more comfortable claiming visitation or even custody, but their power dynamic in general is very unhealthy, and he's very skeptical he can do anything to oppose her.\n\nI think it's all in his head, but I can't do anything to change his opinion, despite all the ways I've shown him that his mental health won't play that big role and so forth.", "THIS, and I'm surprised more don't see it from this perspective.\n\nESH\n\nYour *ex* has a son with *his ex,* and this boy isn't actually your stepson at this point. It's really awesome that you have a good relationship with him still, and it sounds like it's beneficial for all of you. But a 10yo child, particularly a 10yo child with special needs who struggles with emotional regulation and social cues, should not be put in this position. You weren't an AH for inviting him, but you should've done it by contacting his mother yourself or having your ex ask.\n\nHis mother should be honest with him now, and tell him that she is the one who would rather keep him for Christmas/eve. If she doesn't want to let him come, it's her responsibility to explain it. That can include telling him that the invitation was inappropriately extended, but it doesn't include pushing you to lie.\n\nHis father should be the one fighting to have his kid on major holidays some years. Perhaps there's a custody/visitation arrangement we don't know about here.\n\nETA: Could you get these kids together to do the tree, etc on another day?", "They started Christmas movies on October 24th here.

But if should still be your ex who navigates this. Unless he and the moon can't make reasonable decisions together, in which case I would think it's a question of the custody agreement. It's a lot to put on a 10 year old, and ideally your ex would have talked to the mom first. But either way, of course don't tell the kid he's not invited. The mom has to tell him it's her decision that he can't go.\n\nI don't suppose all of you, including mom and 13 year old son, couldn't spend it together", "The 10 yo isn\u2019t special needs.
