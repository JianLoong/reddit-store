Mine has my wife's ashes but regardless of whose ashes or even if there wasn't ashes that necklace is an important item to your boyfriend because the most important things it carries is memories. You are in a relationship with a man who lost his wife, what you are doing is telling him there is no room in your heart to understand his grief, and trust me that grief will always be there. Those of us who have lost someone can learn to live and love again but what you are asking of your boyfriend is to \"move on\" or \"get over it\" and that is a sure fire why to drive him away or make him miserable. \n\nEither accept that he is going to keep things that remind him of his late wife and more important that his memory of her IS an important part of him or leave", "YTA.

If anything, the wife made your boyfriend the man he is today. It was her love that allowed him to open himself up to and love another woman (you). It was her life, not just her death, that set the foundation for your life together. There is something really beautiful knowing how much love he has for you, and how much love he can give you because of how he loved his wife.\n\nIt's incredibly selfish to ask anyone who's lost a loved one to forget them.

You can't erase her, the life they had, or the love they shared, but here's the kicker, love is not a finite thing. He can still love and cherish her memory and still have more love for you than you can imagine, unless you run him off with this BS. People grieve in their own time, their own way, for as long as they need to. All you're going to do is make him feel like he needs to hold on tighter because someone is trying to erase her memory.

I suggest you do so.", "Info\n\nYou are getting called the asrehole but I have a family member who is in a similar situation.\n\nEven though the late ex died years ago my relative partner still posts on facebook for all the  anniversaries  how much they miss their first love.  \n\nMy relative is left feeling very much a distant runner up to her preferred partner.\n\nBeen years now.\n\nSo question for you are you ok with this situation never changing...are you 100% sure you won't increasingly resent them?", "YTA.  The necklace means a lot to him, and shouldn\u2019t threaten you and the relationship at all. Please find a way to stop being threatened by how he chooses to remember someone he loved, because if you keep pushing, you\u2019ll end up being someone he chooses to forget.", "YTA. He lost his wife, which was obviously very difficult for him. He's still opened his heart to you to the point that you feel confident he wants to marry you and start a family with you... and you're mad about a necklace? \n\nYou need to grow up, because this man is way too emotionally mature for you. Everybody has a past, and his isn't threatening you in the slightest.", "You asked. He said no. Now drop it.", "YTA. You don't tell people how to live with their grieve. You can move on from the lost and rebuild but our memories are part of our history and you don't understand how important is to honor them.\n\nIf you are this possessive, insecure and/or jealous to see a dead woman as a threat then you should leave him alone.", "Sometimes you don\u2019t need to read beyond the title. YTA", "I dont know NAH i guess.  \nAnd that is only \u00b4cos its her mothers ashes. If it was their wedding band in a necklace i\u00b4d say that you where an AH. But if its the mothers ashes i think it should go to one in her family.   \nBut he isnt an AH for wanting to have a memory close to his heart. One is more than capable to love both a person and a memory of a dead person.", "Yeah, this man ain't gone marry you.", "YTA. You chose to date a widow! What did you expect?", "Don't compete with the dead. You will lose.\n\nYTA", "YTA for sure. I\u2019m pretty sure if I mine died I wouldn\u2019t just give stuff away. I would still like to remember her.", "YTA think about it if your dad died and you kept a bracelet with his name/a date or something on it and your boyfriend told you to get rid of it \u201cbecause you shouldn\u2019t have another man\u2019s name on your jewelers\u201d how would you feel? Not great because that\u2019s pretty unreasonable. \n\nIt\u2019s the same situation. This is about YOUR insecurity and jealousy you need to deal with it without trying to control his life and how he lives it. Deal with it before even talking about marriage or a future.", "YTA. If you can't accept a necklace from the late wife you really shouldn't date a widower", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nGet over yourself. If you can't respect his life before you, you're not accepting all of him. Just the parts convenient for you.\n\nHere's the thing. You never really stop loving someone. It may warp to hate, but it still nonetheless has a place in your heart. Regardless, a part of his heart will always belong to his ex wife. But that doesn't mean it thtestiens or jeapordizes your relationship. He has moved on enough to start a life with you - that should be worth your respect and admiration.", "Whats next, you will want him to burn all their photo and go to a memory erasing clinic.", "if you don't know the answer to \"If some miracle happened and she came back to life, would he stay with you?\" then i HIGHLY recommend you leave.\n\n\ud83d\ude2c the insecurity sets in because you know in your gut you're second fiddle. and no one likes to feel like that. idc what anyone else says in this damn comment section about not fearing the dead you need to look out for your OWN future. if the only reason they're with you is because the person they actually want to be with is dead that's not worth staying. i'd run for the hills personally.\n\nidc if you all downvote me for that life is too precious to mess around with a man who doesn't worship your existence.", "YTA. You're jealous of a dead woman. That's just weird. \nIf my husband died I'd wear his and my rings in summer way for the rest of my life. Any new man would have to be on board or say goodbye.", "YTA. how insensitive are you? His late wife was a huge part of his life. The slight tone of jealousy here is not a good look. You owe him an apology.", "YTA for deciding for your partner that it's time for him to get rid of reminders of his late wife.\n\nHave a little generosity --  respect and include her memory in your family going forward. She's part of his history.", "YTA. you are not replacing his dead wife, you\u2019re supposed to be adding to his life. he can love you and honor her memory at the same time. the necklace doesn\u2019t have to hold her ashes, it holds her memory. if you aren\u2019t comfortable with this, you should break up now instead of expecting him to erase her from his life to make room for your jealous ego.", "him keeping it in a safe space wouldn\u2019t bother me but wearing it everyday still? maybe a little far\u2026. grief is so strange though. idk.", "YTA - let it go! Let it gooooo! The ashes never bothered you anyway!", "Yes YTA \n\nWhy are you jealous of a dead wife, she passed away, he wears it because it's a memory for him to remember her by. \n\nI suggest you stop otherwise you might lose your partner and all for it being a necklace that belonged to his deceased wife.", "A gentle YTA. This is an emotional subject for both of you. But demanding a behavior occur is very much in AH territory. You need communication and compassion. \n\nYou might want to ask yourself where this desire to put away the necklace is coming from. Feeling insecure or jealous towards a past partner would not be unusual. \n\nWhile not the same, imagine if he had lost a child. The memories, love, and grief don\u2019t just disappear. It also won\u2019t prevent him from having the ability to love others.\n\nHis wife will always be a part of him. Grief ebbs and flows and has nothing to do with how happy he is with you (many widows feel more guilt when things are going well in the relationship!).If you could find space to honor her memory and allow him to open up it could be healing for the both of you. \n\nGrief is tricky. And building a new relationship after that loss difficult. It might be worth processing for you both with an individual therapist and a couples therapist. \n\nDiscussing boundaries and what each of your needs and feelings are will help build a stronger relationship for you both.", "INFO: why is wearing it a sweet gesture now, but inappropriate if you get engaged?", "I want you to *REALLY* think about why this affects you.\n\nYou have an issue with *two dead people.*\n\nYTA", "How do you even find the logic that it somehow bothers your relationship? What backwards hoops did you jump through? YTA and if you can\u2019t see it you aren\u2019t ready for a relationship. Do better.", "Yta", "Keeping the necklace is fine. Wearing it means he hasn\u2019t moved on and isn\u2019t ready to marry you.\n\nThere\u2019s no point trying to push anything on him, when he decides he\u2019s ready to stop wearing it, you\u2019ll know there\u2019s emotional room in his life for you.\n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t sit around playing second fiddle and hoping he\u2019ll get over her.", "YTA Why are you jealous of a deceased person? He's allowed to honor his memories of his late wife. Even though it's his late wife's mother's ashes that doesn't mean it wasn't important to his late wife and now him. \n\nLet him keep his necklace and a picture of them up if you'll eventually move in and argue over that too. He can still honor his late wife while being in love and staying with you.", " YTA. Let him honor his wife and his mother how he wants. Just because he\u2019s loved someone before you doesn\u2019t mean he loves you any less.", "You're not ready for this marriage....you're not ready for any marriage.\n\nTake the next Greyhound out of town and let this guy find someone that respects him.", "YTA. Wearing this necklace could be weird (I mean, MIL ashes??), but just keeping it, not at all. Your bf's late wife is part of his life history, and he has every right to want to keep a memento of her and of her mother.", "Until you experience the level of loss he has, you\u2019ll never get how terrible of a request this is. That marriage helped mold him into the man before you today and he\u2019ll think about his wife probably every day for the rest of his life. Let him grieve how he wants to, let him honor her how he wants to, and let him have room to flourish. He has to grieve a life lived and their dreamed life that never came to be. YTA. \n\n\nEmbrace that he\u2019s a sentimental bloke. If all he requires is wearing a necklace to gain any sense of comfort and closure, you lucked out! There are a lot of other ways he could be grieving, such as visiting the gravesite daily or bringing clothes that smell like her to bed each night. He could get a tattoo or want to name kids after her. \n\n\nLosing a spouse is a tragedy. Please get some education on how to be a supportive spouse and that education will benefit any future marriage you will have. Focus on what you can do and how you can improve, especially with conflict resolution and grief. For now, this necklace is a package deal. You can\u2019t have him without the necklace. For others the package is children, debt, dealing with toxic work hours, a bizarre hobby, crazy in-laws, etc. Be grateful for how lucky you are. A lot of people still wouldn\u2019t even be ready to date yet!", "YTA, it's really pathetic that you're jealous of a dead woman.", "YTA & if you keep bringing it up, you'll no longer be needing to concern yourself with planning that future with him.", "YTA.  This is a form of healing for him. It\u2019s a battle you will never, EVER win.  If a necklace his dead wife wore is this much of an issue, you need to leave.  \n\nYou are jealous of a dead woman,  That\u2019s pathetic.", "Yta you will not win against a dead spouse.", "An 'intruding force'...\n\nTherapy y'all\n\nAnd she spins it like *he's* the one that needs to think twice.", "YTA- You need to accept that marrying a widower means that he will always have his late wife in his heart. It\u2019s not weird, it\u2019s not inappropriate. Don\u2019t be insecure about a woman who isn\u2019t here anymore. You\u2019re here, she\u2019s not, and he will ALWAYS love her. You need to accept that if you\u2019re going to marry him. If I were him though I\u2019d be rethinking this relationship", "YTA. She\u2019s dead. Stop being insecure about a dead person.", "YEP, YTA. Run, OP\u2019s bf! Run!", "YTA - you need to drop it and you also need to make peace with the fact that he was married to someone who *died* before you came along. Also be warned that if you decide to take matters into your own hands you will 100% blow up your relationship (if you haven't already) as that will definitely be a deal breaker.\n\nStop being jealous over a dead person. I suppose at least you're not calling her an ex so that's one step up on other people who post similar stories here. But you need to do better.", "NAH. I don't find you unreasonable but you cant force him to give it up if it brings him peace. I would suggest that you dont make it a burning issue. Dont bring up the necklace in your conversations ever. Ignore it completely unless he brings it up and then acknowledge his feelings. The necklace is in the background, you are the one who is bringing it up again and again. So don't", "YTA and there\u2019s a strong possibility your being an AH will end this relationship", "ESH. You could have been more sensitive in bringing up the topic, but you\u2019re not wrong to be concerned. It seems that he\u2019s chosen not to move on from from his wife even while apparently planning a life with you, and his attachment to the necklace is indicative of that. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re \u201cjealous of a ghost\u201d, as other are suggesting because by wearing it everyday he\u2019s essentially telling you that she comes first, and your current life with him will always be subordinate to his memories with her.", "Yeah, I only entertain people fearing the dead if their fears are ghosts or zombies. \n\nNext thing OP wants is him getting rid of anything that reminds OP of his late wife. Hope she is not a stepmom", "I would argue you need to decide if your love can encompass his deceased wife. If your love if not big enough to include her and appreciate she helped create the man you love, you need to move on.\n\nYou are not in love with a divorcee whose past taught him what he did not want and what mistakes not to make. You love a widower and his wife helped him be the person you fell in love with - so she is not only a part of him but is a part of your future together.", "Also, his dead wife is part of who he is - her presence in his life helped shape the man you love today. His commitment to her and her *love of her mother* tells you he loves fiercely - an admirable trait. \n\nDon\u2019t just let it go. Embrace it.", "Seriously. The woman's dead, she's the least threat to ever threat. Woman needs to stop digging up the dead in her search for problems.", "Good thing he didn't have kids with his ex, if a damn necklace is a problem, well....", "HE CONTINUES TO WEAR THE NECKLACE OF HIS DEAD WIFE FILLED WITH ASHES OF HER MOTHER. Now, he has been with a woman two years  and plans on getting married to her and having children. You are all deluding yourself if you would think his wearing this necklace forever is not weird.", "First, I agree. Second, \u201cdon\u2019t be jealous of ghosts\u201d goes so fucking hard.", "This. OP unless you are willing to give up every.single.item that has sentimental value to you from a person no longer here, SHUT YOUR MOUTH. You think it's sweet and then it's not? Seriously, think of it this way. Think of it this way. Find the most sentimental item you have of someone you loved that's no longer living. Now your soon to be husband wants you to give it away. Like great start to the marriage right? Here this thing that didn't bother me now bothers me so toss it out. What better way to start that commitment than a nice old seed of resentment to plant. He is so rethinking this marrying to OP now that her mask slipped.

A small photo of this woman in OP\u2019s and her boyfriend\u2019s home (if they live together) would be a really nice gesture, assuming the boyfriend welcomes it.", "And I\u2019m sure if he didn\u2019t propose because of this she would think her jealousy was right, that she couldn\u2019t hold a candle to his dead wife. He\u2019s literally committed to the point of marrying again, and she does this? It is absolutely breakup material.", "nah she should leave. nobody wants to be second fiddle and it sounds like she's second fiddle if he hasn't moved on.", "Just wanted to say, sorry for your loss", "She acts like this is someone who dumped him, or a girl from hs he's still obsessed with for no reason.

They specifically make necklaces that you can put cremated ashes in. I have one myself. It's an incredibly common thing to do.", "I don\u2019t think I can give a judgment, but I wanted to make it clear: It\u2019s not even the wife\u2019s ashes, it\u2019s his late MIL!", "Exactly. \n\nI thought it was sweet, but we're moving towards marriage and children ourselves, and I don't think it would be appropriate for him to wear it once we're engaged. I feel it would be too much of an intruding force on our family.\n\nI dont think its appropriate they get married if she cant respect his grief for his late wife. It was still her necklace regardless of whose ashes it contained,  and obviously meant a lot to her.", "You say this but you'll change your tone once OP comes back saying her husband had sex with his dead wife.", "But \u2026 ZOMBIES!!! \ud83d\ude31", "exactly this. but with the caveat. i don't think it's irrational at all to not be able to handle that or not want that.\n\nthis is exactly how it should be approached and handled but let's not kid ourselves not everyone is cut out for it. \ud83d\ude2c some ppl want to be the one and only and I don't think that's unreasonable or irrational.", "You mean, his mother in law?\n\n\nHe didn't get divorced. She is still part of his family, even though she and his wife has passed.", "THANK YOU!!!!! Sometimes this sub loses its freaking collective mind. \n\nRefusing to take off a necklace with your past mother-in-law's ashes is creepy beyond.

And if she acts like that maybe he should rethink marrying her.", "Yes!! i read a post on here where a woman was with a man whose late wife passed from illness. The woman goes to the cemetery to honor her among other things. It shows maturity but more importantly respect for somebody that literally died. its not like OP\u2019s bf cant love them both", "She would be playing second fiddle if he was prioritizing someone else over her.

OP still gets his time, energy, and affection.", "Thank you", "that\u2019s what i meant to say. thank you for clarifying that for me. even still if it was his mothers ashes or a family members ashes and my girlfriend or significant other told me to give it away i would straight up dump her", "That person's relationship status is not my problem.", "If the grave/casket had a hole in it, I'd still be afraid of ghosts/zombies, but everyone has their own fears I suppose. \n\nPS: she should have broken up when she noticed the late wife's tombstone had a hole drilled into it.", "Nah, if by some miracle his dead wife came back to life would he still be with OP? if the answer is no then guess what. You're second fiddle \ud83d\ude2c\n\nPlus he wears mementos of her daily. That's... gotta feel like the memory of her is ever present and looming. And that's entirely normal and his right to do so! By no means should he be asked to give that up or anything but to me this sub is pretending like ghosts can't stand in between people and it's irrational to feel like you're competing with a dead person for space in someone's life. \n\nI mean ffs we can accept this in fictional characters (Robert Baratheon, Lyanna Stark, Cersei Lannister) but we can't imagine that happening with real people?", "By no Miracle will she come back to life. \nWhat a stupid statement.", "If you don't want to engage with the hypothetical and can't handle talking through complicated emotions like an adult then you can just not comment.
