Bold of that man to assume you didn\u2019t need it because of your age. Invisible disabilities exist. I hate this mindset", "NTA. It\u2019s a handicapped spot, not an old people spot. It doesn\u2019t matter what you \u201clook\u201d like, if you were handicapped you\u2019d have every right to the spot same as any old person who is handicapped.", "NTA.  You weren\u2019t parking.", "NTA. As others have said, you were only turning around, not parking to \"run in for a minute\" like I've heard other people do. Safety is important.", "NTA\n\nGrumpy old man just wanted to park and not allow you to turn to what I assume is rather obvious narrow area for any size vehicles. In addition, just because you\u2019re young and you may not look like a handicapped doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t. I hate that mentality of \u2018you must look like a certain way\u2019 to have your way. Heck old man could be an ass either he was or wasn\u2019t handicapped.", "NTA - You were just using it to turn around. He\u2019s also an AH for saying you look \u201cawfully young\u201d to have a disability. Disability doesn\u2019t age discriminate. Imagine if you had been disabled, he would\u2019ve heckled you just for using an accessible parking spot.", "NTA. For gods sake. You were just turning around! Grumpy grand dad was just in a mood.", " NTA if you were just using it to turn around. If you planned to park there then TA.", "NTA if you were just using it to turn around. Old dude is TA for ranting at you.", "NTA. You weren't planning to park there, just used it to turn around and leave. I guess he had bad experiences previously with people who didn't have accessibility issues parking in accessible/handicap spots, and lashed out on you.\n\nIt's also worth noting being young does not equal being free of mobility challenges, unfortunately, so him judging you solely based on you looking \"too young to need it\" is nothing short of ignorant and he should know better - as a person who's had Lupus since 24, I can sadly attest to that. Again, he probably had past experiences with inconsiderate people that have nothing to do with you. Not excusing his behavior, just know his rant has nothing to do with you or your behavior in this scenario.", "NTA. You did not park there and you did not plan on doing so.", "NTA, you made a mistake and then were attempting to correct it. It's not your fault he blocked you in and once you were able to, you left.", "NTA\n\nYou did what you had to do to ensure safe driving. The elderly man misunderstood your intentions.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly someone shouldn't just assume that a young person isn't disabled by looking at them. Many disabilities are invisible. I'm 18 and have an invisible disability that no one could guess just by looking at me. My stepdad has an invisible disability but has and uses a blue badge, again no one would know his disability just by looking at him so that man assuming people can't have disabilities just because they 'look too young' is ableist. \n\nAnd you weren't actually parking in it, you were using it for less than 30 seconds to turn and get out safely without causing anyone harm as it was the only safe option. What did he want you to do, ram into people and cars to get out to avoid using the disabled spot? Ridiculous. If he hadn't stopped and argued with you then you would've been out of the way in seconds. \n\nSome people are ridiculous.", "NTA! The one time it is acceptable to use a handicapped spot is to safely turn around to leave. \n\nFor all the people who will comment there was another alternative, there are dead-end lots where this happens. He is a new driver and chose the safest course of action. Better to use an empty space to turn around than to try to make a Y-turn and possibly hit a car.", "No NTA. You are allowed to turn around.", "How often are you going to post this?", "NTA you were just turning around... Drs and whomever give out handicap placards give them out like candy now when you are willing to pay your $25 or whatever it is.  It is an odd sense of entitlement to people who have them to yell at others for the spot...", "NTA. Although it was a mistake to park in an accessible parking spot, it seems like you had good intentions and were trying to navigate a narrow parking lot safely. I get that the elderly man was upset at first, but he shouldn't have gone on a rant and blocked you in the spot. In the end, you were able to resolve the situation peacefully by asking him to move his car so you could exit. It's important to be mindful of accessible parking spots in the future, but in this case, it seems like it was an honest mistake and you handled the situation appropriately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
