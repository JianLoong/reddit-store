Both my side and my husband\u2019s side of the family live close, so we see each other all the time. On my side of the family, we get together every Friday at either my house or one of my sibling\u2019s houses for pizza. This past weekend, I was the one hosting Pizza Night.\n\nOur 13 y/o had his friends over that night, which sometimes happens on these nights and there hasn\u2019t been an issue before this. My son\u2019s baseball teammates were over, one of his friends, Karsyn, got diagnosed as autistic a few months ago. This isn\u2019t particularly surprising, as something was always different with him, he\u2019s still a popular, smart boy but it all made sense when he was diagnosed. My son and his friends are very confident in themselves, including Karsyn, and Karsyn\u2019s new special interest after baseball is his autism. Karsyn believes his autism makes him who he is, he is insanely smart, helps my son and his friends with homework and he can tell you anything about baseball. Karsyn, my son, and his friends also like making jokes about themselves, one of his friends is gay and jokes about his sexuality. My husband and I have made sure to talk to the boys about knowing what is and isn't appropriate and to know your boundaries.\n\nKarsyn will make jokes about his autism, usually directed at mocking what he believes are ableist parents, mocking anti-vaxxers, ect. Karsyn was upstairs with my son and their other friends before my husband or I got home. We had the family come over after school/work and when pizza was ready, everyone came to the kitchen and dining room. Karsyn had some shirt on that said \u201cI love someone with allism\u201d, allism is apparently a word autistics use for people who aren\u2019t autistic. We all sat down and my sister made a comment about the shirt. My sister and her son have a \u201cseverely\u201d autistic son, he\u2019s 15 and can\u2019t do much on his own. My sister asked what the shirt meant and said it wasn\u2019t funny, it started escalating there, with my son and his friends getting rowdy. Karsyn then said something about not being a burden, to which my sister said \u201cfor some of my friend\u2019s, their children\u2019s autism are burdens, their children are burdens\u201d, at that point, I screamed at everyone to shut up and told my sister and her husband to leave. \n\nSince then, tensions have been pretty high, and we don\u2019t even know if there will be a pizza night next week. My sister and her husband has only dug their heels in their position, my son is very upset, and cried to us about how his aunt could see someone like Karsyn, a long time friend, as a \u201cburden\u201d. Most of my family is siding with my sister saying that children should \u201crespect their elders\u201d and said Karsyn is \u201cfull of himself\u201d. My son is still very hurt by those comments and I feel like he has a right to be, and haven;\u2019t apologized to my sister.

Your sister got into a shouting match with a 13-yo about a snarky shirt. She has a \"severely\" autistic child and doesn't know what allistic means? To me, it sounds like she's got a morality complex about raising such a \"burden\" and Karsyn directly challenged it. It's exactly what the shirt was mean to do, and she got hooked. She's ableist and deserved to be called out.", "NTA. So your adult sister started a fight with a 13 year old child she'd never met before and ended it by telling him that people like him are burdens? YIKES. You were right to kick your sister out. Her behavior was entirely inappropriate.\n\nAnyone who starts a fight with a child and then says they should \"respect their elders\" even when those elders are being cruel is not a person that should be around your kids. Your sister needs some therapy and some space away from your kids.\n\nLook, any 13 year old, autistic or allistic, is capable of being annoying as shit. Recently diagnosed autism adds some fun neurospicy sprinkles on top of behaviors and attitudes that I have no problem believing are totally obnoxious and especially triggering to your sister. But it's our job as adults to manage our own emotions about it. Your sister totally failed at that part.", "You are NTA. Your sister is a major AH. She started a fight with an autistic child, demonstrated an extraordinary amount of internalized ableism, and expressly told Karsyn that people like him are burdens - it's not a stretch to interpret that as saying children like Karsyn are unwanted. I'm sure she sometimes feels overwhelmed by the needs of her family. That doesn't give her the right to dump her feelings on Karsyn and invalidate his lived experience as the person who actually has the neurodivergence.", "NTA, and THANK YOU for standing up for us. My parents scapegoated me because I was \"so difficult a baby\" and turns out... I am Autistic. Your sister sees her kid as a burden (just like my parents) and tried to project that feeling onto Karsyn; I'm glad you put your foot down with her. THANK YOU.", "NTA. Your sister picked a fight with a 13 year old. That's all that needs to be said.", "I can\u2019t imagine how your poor nephew must feel since his mom considers him, or at the very least, people like him to be a burden. Believe it or not, even autistics with higher support needs like your nephew are capable of understanding what people say about them.\n\nNTA and I am glad you stood up for your son\u2019s friend.", "NTA, AT ALL. \n\n>\u201cfor some of my friend\u2019s, their children\u2019s autism are burdens, their children are burdens\u201d\n\nThis was out of line. I don't care How true it may be, you do NOT say that to an autistic child (ANY child honestly, but still.) That comment was flat out bullying of a child. \n\nAnd the whole \"respect your elders\" is bullsh*t. Politeness is given, respect is EARNED. No one needs to respect anyone who is showing themselves to be undeserving of that respect. Age alone doesn't automatically qualify one as a respectable individual, and I'll die on that hill.\n\nMy opinion, you did the right thing.", "NTA. Your sister picked a fight with a 13 year old.\n\nWow.", "NTA - your sister may struggle to come to terms with her son\u2019s difficulties. But that doesn\u2019t give her the right to tell autistic people how to express their own identity and nor does it give your sister\u2019s troubles and inherent ableism precedence over the feelings of disabled people she interacts with.\n\nThose shirts are not really meant to be \u201chaha\u201d funny; they\u2019re a satirical criticism directed at those who decide that allistic voices are more important than autistic ones in discussions on autism, and who insist on using language that goes against the preferences of the majority of the autistic community [the majority of autists prefer not to use person-first language and would prefer to be called \u201cautistic\u201d rather than \u201cperson with autism\u201d - but many neurotypical people will insist they\u2019re being \u201cnice\u201d by ignoring the choices of the people they\u2019re referring to and will insist on using person-first language].\n\nBy making her feelings on the subject more important than those of the autistic person in the room, criticising the shirt without understanding it, and making the whole thing into a fight that didn\u2019t need to happen, your sister declared herself (intentionally or otherwise) to be within that group of people who see autism as an enemy to be defeated. For autistic people who consider autism to be a central part of who they are, this is very little different to saying that you hate autistic people and wish they didn\u2019t exist - so that\u2019s why your sister\u2019s view was offensive: she herself isn\u2019t autistic - she shouldn\u2019t be implying that level of hate towards people who are.\n\nI\u2019m sure your sister\u2019s life isn\u2019t easy. But that doesn\u2019t make it okay to say that sort of thing to or about children because of things that are intrinsically part of who and how they are.", "NTA.  What you sister and her husband did to a 13 y.o. autistic child, and the behavior they modeled for the other children present, was vile.  \n\nThe notion that you should respect your elders while they tear you and your friends to shreds with things like racism, or homophobia, or weird ableism, or just plain cruelty, is a feeble excuse for adults whose behavior is inexcusable.  Your sister's own child's issues are not an excuse to be outrageously hurtful to another child.  \n\nThrowing out people who are flat out hurting children and modeling abhorrent behavior is the right thing to do.  You had Karsyn's back and showed your child that you walk the walk.  You showed him that you stand up to bullies, and that you protect children in your home.   \nBravo, Mom!!!\n\nDo Not Apologize.    \n\nSupport your child.  Support Karsyn.  It sounds like you and your husband are doing a really good job in helping your child understand appropriate vs. inappropriate ways to address differences between friends respectfully.   \n\nDemand that your sister apologize.  Do not allow her within 100 yards of your very nice child and his friends until she understands that what she did is inexcusable and must not happen again.  \n\nP.S.  You might want to let Karsyn's parents know what happened, as, verbal and intelligent as he was in locking horns with your sister, what your sister said might have been traumatic, and they should know so they can address it with him if necessary.", "NTA your sister does realize that Autism is a Spectrum Disorder & if she truly believes her son is a burden then she is doing him a disservice by raising him. Just like there are a plethora of colors & gradients, there are a plethora of ways autism can present itself. Your nephew, like ALL people, deserves to be loved & understood. A burden is something you deal with, chosen or not, & is not a way to describe anyone regardless of their capabilities.", "Your sister is the adult in this situation. She is the asshole. If you have nothing nice to say - say nothing at all. She literally started picking on children because she didn't agree. Disgusting behavior.", "NTA\n\nYour sister was way out of line taking her frustrations with her life out on a 13 year old kid, a guest in your house. Everything your sister said to Karsyn was out of line.", "I cannot stress enough how NTA you are. I have an autistic child who falls more on the severe end of the spectrum as well, but I\u2019ve never once felt he is a \u201cburden\u201d. To me it sounds like your sister has some things she needs to work on in therapy. Your home sounds like one filled with love and acceptance, one id love my son to spend time in.", "Your sister should have let him be (kept to herself) and not made those types of comments to a child and a child with autism at that. NTA.", "NTA just because she\u2019s older doesn\u2019t give her the right to be rude. I love that a 13 year old kid has the courage to stand up for him self, and you apparently raised an amazing young boy who supports and cares for his friends. You should be very proud!", "NTA. Your sister was being an ah for calling her son a burden and for basically telling that other kid that he was a burden to his parents. As for you, I don\u2019t think screaming was the best thing to do but I still don\u2019t think y ta.", "NTA\n\nYour grown ass sister picked a fight with a 13-year-old boy. And she doesn't even have a good argument. He has autism and he's allowed to express his feelings around it. If she has such an issue hearing others' opinions on this, then she needs a good therapist to vent to. What she doesn't need to do is attack a 13-year-old who has newly been diagnosed and who is navigating what that means to HIM, ffs.", "Yeah, your sister is an asshole. NTA. Karsyn's shirt was about people exactly like her.", "1. No, you are NTA for making your sister leave. Regardless of your stance, you recognized a grown adult having an intense argument with a child whose parents entrust in your care was inappropriate and you swiftly defused the situation by separating them.\n\n2. I can\u2019t imagine the difficulty having a severely autistic child, and maybe having your son\u2019s friend more or less make light of the condition was triggering for her. FWIW, I don\u2019t think he was, nor do I find offense to his shirt. Regardless, to imply to that child that he may be a burden, when he obviously is doing his very best to cope with it, is wildly wrong. Two separate conversations need to be had here, one with your sister and one with your son. Understanding and grace should be given to both. That said, this child does not owe your sister any kind of apology.", "NTA - This was just a joke. Maybe not the best joke but definitely not a harmful joke. I get your sister has a tougher time with her child who doesn't seem to function as well as Karsyn, but that doesn't make him the bad guy for having a sense of humor about his situation.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, considering Karsyn is not your kid, they shouldn't be holding you responsible for his behavior, you aren't in the position to control or discipline him (beyond telling him he has to go home).  If your son had been the one she was arguing with it would be different, but you don't control his friends.  Why is she mad at you for something someone else said or did?\n\nSecond, I don't see a problem with the shirt he was wearing given the situation.  Obviously autism is a tough thing, I'm sure your sister is very sensitive about it, but I think it is really cool that Karsyn is able to embrace his disability and be proud of who he is.  As someone with autism, there is nothing wrong with him wearing that shirt.\n\nThe whole \"respect your elders\" is BS... just because you are old doesn't mean you are right!  Frankly, I think we'd all be better off if the world wasn't run by a bunch of old men who don't really even understand the modern world.", "\"karsyn\" lol", "I find it VERY sad your sister considers her child a \u201cburden\u201d. My son is ASD and I have a nephew with moderate cerebral palsy.

If one's feels gets hurted by this, one has a problem and it isn't the t-shirt.\n- Mom with autistic kids.\n\nSecond, those boys seem to be smarter than your adult sister or the \"should respect elder\" bullshit giving relatives.\nYes, life isn't always easy. Having severe autistic \nkid surely don't make it any easier. But it's not ok to pour your shit on to some kids back. \n\nMaybe I wouldn't kick them out, but I certainly would have said sister to should the f up. That would propably be even worse, so maybe your way was better. \n\nI must say that I would be quite petty and childish there, but I could not respect those people and even less could apologize for sister whos misbahavior started the  whole thing.\n\nOP is NTA.", "NTA. As a parent to autisic children and partner of an autistic man I'm thoroughly upset about someone saying that to an autistic 13 year old.", "Your son's friend is a kid who doesn't really know about autism - which is rather normal. He thinks autism means 'me'. That boy, Karsyn, is just a kid - if he was your son I'd suggest sitting him down - but you are not his parents - that's not your job. \n\nYou could talk to your son, make him aware that Karsyn isn't the definition of autism, there's a cousin who has a very severe version - he should be aware of that, already. Autism can be pretty difficult. I feel for your sister - as in, saying that her son is a burden, that's gotta be painful for her, it's probably something she feels that she wasn't looking to confront. \n\nThat said, NTA, but these are a lot of overreactions - your sister could have gritted her teeth and not engage in an argument with a kid who just started puberty - it was just a t-shirt. Admittedly you could have handled it better too, but this seems to have come out the left field, and you seem to have been gotten overwhelmed. \n\nTry to keep more of the family from getting involved - personally, I think you should talk to your sister and her husband - adults to adults, if at the moment you feel you should apologize you could... It's a bit of an unnecessary mess - it's not like YOU were wearing the t-shirt. This stems from your sister's issues with her son, it isn't a fight for the entire family to have - it's probably out of an emotional exhaustion with the situation she is in... One can empathize with that.", "YTA\n\nKarsyn needs help learning when it's best **not** to push something.  It's fantastic that your children are confident.  Although, from your post, it sounds like Karsyn is right on the line separating \"confident\" from \"completely full of himself\"\n\nIt sounds like your sister was not being an AH.  She said \"for **SOME PEOPLE** children with autism are a burden.\"  She was not saying Karsyn was a burden.  **He took it personally when it was not intended to be about him**.  She meant it about her own lower functioning autistic child.\n\nSince people on the autism spectrum (such as myself) have a hard time reading people, he needs to learn that, sometimes, **not** saying something is the best approach.\n\nKarsyn pushing the issue with your sister was deeply hurtful to her.  I'm sure he didn't mean to cause harm.  But **he** owes her an apology.  And hopefully he can start learning, sometimes, saying nothing is the best course of action.\n\nYou can be right, or you can be happy.  You can't be both.", "ESH", "ESH Your sister should have let it drop after saying she didn't find the shirt funny. It wasn't appropriate for her to get into an argument with a 13 year old. However, what your sister said is accurate from her experience. I'm sure she sometimes does feel like her son is a burden and may have friends in similar situations who at least sometimes feel the same way. It was not nice for her to say this out loud, but she has a right to her feelings.\n\nThe kid does sound full of himself. It's great that he is using humor and has confidence, but it's not appropriate for him to argue with an adult as a guest in someone's home.\n\nYou overreacted by throwing your sister out of your home. You took what she said in the worst way possible, and she wasn't necessarily implying that the kid is a burden to his family. If the kid doesn't want to hear negative things he shouldn't get into arguments. You could have stepped in and said the conversation is over and let's change the subject.", "ESH. Your sister was way out of line picking a fight with a 13 y/o. It doesn't really matter what was on the shirt, adults need to act like adults and leave a little extra room for children's behavior.\n\nIt's not what people want to hear, but Karsyn was out of line too. His confidence about his autism is admirable, but that doesn't mean his shirt is inoffensive. The reality is that being the parent of an autistic kid can come with outsized demands. Those parents can need extra support and community.\n\nSo mocking the fact that there is a community that exists for autism supports is misguided and rude, despite the fact that Karsyn may not need to draw upon those supports himself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
