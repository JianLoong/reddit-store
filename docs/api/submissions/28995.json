I learned that he\u2019s been wanting to get a buzz cut for a couple months now but his mom, my sister, has absolutely forbade it since she feels it would make him look like a \u2018thug\u2019. I think it\u2019s a bit ridiculous. He\u2019s 16, a junior in high school, and at the age kids can drive, so I think he\u2019s very much old enough to make his own decisions regarding something impermanent like hair. \n\nI said as much to him, and he asked if he could use the electronic razor I had to get a buzzcut. Obviously this was a case of him going over his mom\u2019s head, but as I said, I think she\u2019s being ridiculous, so I told him to go ahead. He did so, and the result looked pretty good.\n\nMy sister called me when he got back home freaking out, saying I had no right to supersede her authority and make that decision for her. I told her that she\u2019s right it\u2019s not my decision, but it\u2019s not hers either, he\u2019s almost an adult and can make choices about *his* hair. It\u2019s not as I gave him the go ahead to get a tattoo or a nose ring, or even to dye his hair an absurd color. Beyond the simple fact that he should have the autonomy to make the choice, the choice he made isn\u2019t bizarre, or irreversible, and won\u2019t cause any problems. It\u2019s just a buzz cut. \n\nShe got angry and said I have no right to let her kid do what she forbade, but I pointed out that she was being awfully controlling. She hung up and posted on our family GC what an AH I was. \n\nHer husband and the rest of the family mostly agree with me that it\u2019s just a buzz cut and not that deep, but her vehemence makes me wonder, am I in the wrong?

And was his hair good looking? \n\n\nI\u2019m joking obviously NTA your sisters being silly and weird", "No way are you TA for this, your sis is over-the-top controlling. My guess is if he'd gone elsewhere and done it himself, she would be just as livid, but you're now a convenient target for her to focus her ire on.\n\nGood for you for letting your nephew- who's old enough to drive- exercise a little autonomy over his own body and appearance. \n\nNTA", "NTA: A 16 year old can go get their own hair cut. I certainly popped into the salon for a trim or a brow wax at that age. Children aren't chattel. Some comments act like the parent owns them. It's weird.", "NTA. He could have walked into any salon and got it cut himself.  You allowed your nephew to borrow your razor.  That's what family does.  \n\nTell your sister that she only has two years left with her son.  Then he'll run from her. Does she want her last month's spent in conflict over absurd issues?", "It seems like you persuade him to do it because his mother was \"being silly\". Could've handled it better IMO.", "He would have found a way to do it himself anyway. In the 90s my mom wanted me to have long hair and my parents wouldn\u2019t let me cut it. When I was 15 I used my friend\u2019s mom\u2019s clippers and buzzed off all my hair. My parents were pissed and my dad told me I looked stupid but I didn\u2019t care. It was something I could control that my parents couldn\u2019t do much about no matter how mad it made them. This kid was going to find a way, with your help or someone else\u2019s. NTA but his mom is.", "YTA. Some schools do not allow buzz cuts. You could have been the cause of school exclusion. You should have said no, because his Mum said no. You undermined her.  The lad will be able to choose his haircuts soon enough. He was not being harmed by having to wait until he could pay for his own hair cut to have a buzz cut", "Imagine being 16 and not even have the freedom of choosing your own hairstyle", "NTA he has autonomy", "I will never understand why parents want to control a kid's hair.  My mom did it too.  Still tries, actually.  It's hair.  It grows out.  Weird colors can be redyed or cut out.  Weird haircuts can be reshaped if they need to be.  I just don't get it.  \n\nNTA.  He's 16 and it's his hair.", "ESH\n\nYeah, his mom is ridiculous, but at the end of the day, he's not your kid and that's not your decision.", "YTA... Not your kid. If he did it on his own, that's one thing, but you're destroying multiple trusts in your family. My nephew (16) is not allowed to ride on my motorcycle with me. I don't think that's the right decision, but would never take him out anyway. If I did, I would damage the trust between my brother and i, as well as between my brother and his son. That is the core of the issue, not whether or not you think it's ok...", "ESH\n\nHe's 16. He is quite capable of walking in to a hairdresser and getting a haircut. He doesn't need mommy to hold his hand and tell the hairdresser what kind of haircut he wants - he just needs his head, and some money. So Mommy is being an asshole about his hair.\n\nSo if he had asked of his own volition whether you had clippers and whether he could use them, I'd be calling you a non-asshole: you wouldn't be doing anything that he couldn't have just bought.\n\nBut you didn't just do that - you encouraged him to cut his hair. By your description, you brought the subject up, and offered him the opportunity, and that makes you an asshole as well.", "YTA! He\u2019s not your child & you ADMIT deliberately going behind her back & letting him do something you KNEW she didn\u2019t approve of!\nHe still lives with her & should be following her rules. \nIt\u2019s not even about a haircut, it\u2019s about your actions.", "Yeah, YTA. You stepped right in the middle of a disagreement between your nephew and his mom, gave him the answer he wanted (that he couldn't get at home), and then want to know if you were an A H? Of course you were. \n\nOf course your sister's being ridiculous and controlling. He's 16 and can't cut his hair how he wants? She is not doing your nephew any favors. If you want to help, though, talk with her. Tell her she needs to back off and let her son start making more decisions for himself, that he is nearly grown and will do better when he leaves her house if he has some room to be independent and make mistakes now, while he has her for a safety net.", "NTA. I started making my own haircut/style choices when I was 12-ish. And like someone else said\u2026it\u2019s hair. It will grow back. Your sister sounds extremely controlling.", "NTA. Your sister is ridiculous about his hair. He's 16. He could walk in to virtually any barber and walk out with a buzz cut, no questions asked.\n\nI would imagine you could have talked to her first, but from your other comments, it seems like she has no idea why dictating his hair is an issue\n\nHelping to circumvent the control of someone trying to prevent the autonomy of another person isn't wrong.", "NTA. You\u2019re in college, so I am assuming that you are 22 or younger. Which means you are more of a peer to your nephew than an authority figure. \n\nYour nephew is old enough to make his own choices when it comes to his hair style. He asked your opinion and you were honest.", "On the one hand it's just hair. It will grow back. \n\nOn the other hand you down your nephew that his mother does not need to be respected or listened to. Whether you think it's fair, or valid doesn't matter. It's ultimately not your choice because you are not this boys mother. \n\nYou've helped him learn an important lesson. If mom says no, go ask elsewhere. \n\nYTA", "He is 16 which is old enough to be making decisions on how he wants his hear. NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s a controlling psycho. The more she controls, the more he\u2019s gonna rebel", "Nta. My parents were big on \" you will wear this \" and \" keep your hair like this\". This might seem harmless but it does a lot of damage someone. I decided grow out my hair and only wear some oversized tees and jeans for a few years after leaving home because my father thought i didnt look good and didnt let me do it. It kind of felt like having some control over my life. I thought during my late teens that he just didnt respect me enough as a person , as i was about to be an adult and still had to listen to his opinion.", "NTA", "Nta. It's hair it grows back. As long as he is the one caring for it and tending to its upkeep and paying for anything extravagant out of his own pocket he should be allowed some autonomy with the style he wants. Especially at 16. And a buzz cut? How is that thuggish? It's such probably the most conservative/old fashioned/preppy cut for boys ever lol military,police and many private schools actually still mandate it for males. Thuggish? Sounds like your sis is grasping at straws to maintain control. The only thing I banned my kids from with hairstyles was shaving obscenities into it and permanent hairdyes/bleaching before 14 years old. (And boy was the hairdye rule fought about by some of the kids \ud83e\udd23)", "He's old enough to go to a barber or get his own clippers and do it himself.  He was going to do it one way or another \n\nNTA", "NTA.  His mom is insanely controlling.  He is old enough to pick his own haircut.", "NTA. Hair is such a low risk way for kids to explore their identity nd how they want to look. It's bizarre to me that his mom is dying on this hill.", "YTA. I don't agree with the mother freaking out over a buzz cut, my kids were choosing their hairstyles at age 5 or 6. But the mother has ultimate authority here, and as her sister you have no right to defy that.\n\nYou are not this teens legal guardian.  You just created drama between a mother and son by stepping in. It won't help him, eithet", "NTA- He's 16, almost an adult. He should definitely have the autonomy to choose what he wants to do with his hair. The fact that her own husband and the rest of the family mostly agree with you, shows how much of a controlling and ridiculous AH she's being.", "So let me get this straight, she forbade him to get a buzzcut, but he can technically join the military (with any guardian's approval) which would in turn...give him a buzzcut. Your sister is beyond ridiculous, she's delusional.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m glad you let him cut his hair the way I wanted.  I never had control of my own hair when I was a kid, and I hated it so bad!  NTA.", "NTA. In two years she's going to be wondering why her son never comes home to visit. Kids should absolutely have control over their own bodies. Hair is such an easy way to let kids have a sense of self and individuality without impacting or hurting anyone else. Our rule always has been if it's legal (so no tattoo before 18) and not against things like school rules, it's their body, their choice.", "NAH. She's being precious and controlling, but also maybe she's having a hard time learning to let go of her little boy.", "NTA. Your sister is being controlling and ridiculous.", "I used to get angry at my ex for getting my son a buzzcut every month. I didn't like how it looked, acknowledged the simplicity of caring for it, but I was only angry because my son *hated* it. \n\nBut, the foolish man insisted the poor boy get one, every month. He now has an estranged adult son, with hair down to his arse. \n\nPerhaps your and/or nephew needs to phrase it as about bodily autonomy, consent, and respect - as in her transitioning to respecting his basic humanity rather than seeing herself as his \"boss\" and him as an accessory to dress and show off. \n\nThat young man will rebel in many ways, this is nothing. You did enable it, so of course his mother will be mad at you. Perhaps that will distract her rage from the lad, as well as give him the knowledge that you're in his corner.\n\nNTA", "YTA, you might thing it was silly little thing, his  legal parent/guardian didn't and that is all that should matter.  You had no right to allow him to do something she explicitly said he couldn't do when you had full knowledge of her feelings.\n\nMaybe you will understand one day when you have children.", "YTA. You knew his mother was against it and did it anyway. You clearly have no respect for her, her rules or her wishes.", "If a guy wants to look like it's 1997, who is anyone to stop them?", "NTA\n\nI understand her though.  Letting go of control as the kids age is very hard.\n\nShe needs the family around her (like you are) to apply social pressure to encourage her to back off.", "Your sister was being excessively controlling and intrusive in a 16 y.o.'s life.  Technically speaking, she's the parent, so you shouldn't have ignored her wishes for her child.  But I don't actually care about that.  I don't think you did anything wrong.  \n\nHow fast do you want to bet your nephew is going to high tail it out of there once he's 18.  I'm betting pretty damned fast.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
