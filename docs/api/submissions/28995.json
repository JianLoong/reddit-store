He did so, and the result looked pretty good.\n\nMy sister called me when he got back home freaking out, saying I had no right to supersede her authority and make that decision for her. I told her that she\u2019s right it\u2019s not my decision, but it\u2019s not hers either, he\u2019s almost an adult and can make choices about *his* hair.

It\u2019s just a buzz cut. \n\nShe got angry and said I have no right to let her kid do what she forbade, but I pointed out that she was being awfully controlling.

It's such probably the most conservative/old fashioned/preppy cut for boys ever lol military,police and many private schools actually still mandate it for males. Thuggish?

I don't agree with the mother freaking out over a buzz cut, my kids were choosing their hairstyles at age 5 or 6.

Hair is such an easy way to let kids have a sense of self and individuality without impacting or hurting anyone else. Our rule always has been if it's legal (so no tattoo before 18) and not against things like school rules, it's their body, their choice.", "NAH. She's being precious and controlling, but also maybe she's having a hard time learning to let go of her little boy.", "NTA. Your sister is being controlling and ridiculous.", "I used to get angry at my ex for getting my son a buzzcut every month. I didn't like how it looked, acknowledged the simplicity of caring for it, but I was only angry because my son *hated* it. \n\nBut, the foolish man insisted the poor boy get one, every month. He now has an estranged adult son, with hair down to his arse. \n\nPerhaps your and/or nephew needs to phrase it as about bodily autonomy, consent, and respect - as in her transitioning to respecting his basic humanity rather than seeing herself as his \"boss\" and him as an accessory to dress and show off. \n\nThat young man will rebel in many ways, this is nothing. You did enable it, so of course his mother will be mad at you. Perhaps that will distract her rage from the lad, as well as give him the knowledge that you're in his corner.\n\nNTA", "YTA, you might thing it was silly little thing, his  legal parent/guardian didn't and that is all that should matter.  You had no right to allow him to do something she explicitly said he couldn't do when you had full knowledge of her feelings.\n\nMaybe you will understand one day when you have children.", "YTA.

Letting go of control as the kids age is very hard.\n\nShe needs the family around her (like you are) to apply social pressure to encourage her to back off.", "Your sister was being excessively controlling and intrusive in a 16 y.o.'s life.  Technically speaking, she's the parent, so you shouldn't have ignored her wishes for her child.  But I don't actually care about that.

And if he doesn't like it, it'll grow back.\n\nI think NTA, but its a little hard to decide.", "YTA. That is not your kid and you had no right encouraging him to do something you KNEW he was not allowed to do. He is still a child under his parent's rules. He has 2 years and then can do as he pleases. You were wrong.", "NTA, I remember when I was a teen, puberty does weird stuff, like make you extra sweaty; having a full head of hair always made it worse. There were times where I would get a buzzcut just to fight the heat.", "Nta your sister needs to pull the stick out of her backside", "NTA. Your sister is freaky controlling.  She might wonder why her son refuses to make a contact after he gets out at 18. It\u2019s on her.", "I'm not going to make a determination here, NTA, because you're right. His mom is overbearing. YTA because you knew she would be upset (now there's unnecessary drama in their house), and you decided anyway what someone's minor child could do. Can't even make an ETA determination here.\n\nBUT: A tidbit about a minor child's hair and their parent trying to control what they do because of how they think it will look. My own experience as a kid slightly younger than him is I wanted to be a \"sceen queen.\" I'm of mixed race and at the time I had dreadlocks that were goofy looking because they were in their infancy stage and my mom had no clue how to upkeep them and this was before the time where just googling or looking up a YouTube video to figure it out wasn't a thing. \n\nI rebelled anyway. I was a good kid otherwise, but I would use whatever money I had from my job to dye my goofy looking dreads crazy colors (and get supplies for piercings so I could have piercings without permission). My mom was outraged for about a year. Huge fights. Finally, she accepted it.\n\nAll of that said. As an adult, I am SO glad I got to express myself through my hair and other things. Almost as soon as I turned 18, I started working jobs that has very strict dress codes, and I abided by them because that's what you do for a job when you're creating your adult life. I'm so glad I had the time as a kid to have fun and express myself. Nothing I did was so permanent that I don't look absolutely professional at a job now (except sometimes a cool new coworker will notice my snake bite scars.) I also still have fun with my look when I'm not at a job with strict dress codes. \n\nLet kids have non-permanent self-expression while they can. Worry about them looking \"professional\" (I have strong beliefs about that too, dgmw) when important stuff comes up like university interview,  etc. where they'ree trying to make a professional impression because when you're an adult is when you have the most constraints about your appearance that can be really important and affect your life. I'm glad I have pictures to show people now how goofy I looked when I was younger (most of the time, it looked good, but I went through some phases that were a little cringe). \n\nAll of that to say: Can't make a determination, but I would have done the same thing.\n\nThis was an actual essay. I wasn't expecting that myself. Thank you to anyone who made it through.", "NTA\n\nKid is 16, not 6. Plenty old enough for his own body autonomy", "NTA. He should have just shaved one random stripe on his head so these women would have to handle it themselves.  Last time I checked, teen boys hair grows so stinking fast that he\u2019ll probably have the hair he had previously in like, 2 or so months.", "Lol your sister is absurd. Does she take him to the barber shop and tell them how to cut it?", "NTA she doesn't want her baby to grow up. And it's only hair.", "ESH - sis sucks for being a controlling dictator. You suck for actively enabling something you knew would cause havoc and conflict. \n\nYou could have at least said \u201cwhat you do after school is outside my remit\u201d and then at least pled some ignorance when he came home bald", "good one", "Literally, you can get clippers for $20", "a real head scratcher", "Some cops are thugs.", "someone else... more like literally everyone", "Yeah weird how the mom thinks OP has dominion over this kid\u2019s body. They simply didn\u2019t wrestle the razor away from him. Should they have tackled the kid if he tried to enter a barbershop?", "she didn't persuade him at all, he wanted to, and she provided him with the means to do so.", ">YTA\n\nIt's his body, he can do whatever he wants as long as it doesn't hurt him, the only thing hurting him is his mom.\n\nlet me tell you this, if a teenage girl can get an abortion because it's her body, then it's perfectly fine for a teenage boy to cut his hair because its his hair.", "She wasn't in the position not to let him do it. The kid made the decision, not her. OP is not an authority figure to him and doesn't get to enforce rules. The kid living at home doesn't mean his mother should have a say in how he cuts his hair, that's overbearing and controlling behavior. Those aren't reasonable rules that should be expected to be followed.", "She didn't make any decisions, the kid did, as is his right. I don't get what kind of \"authority\" that mom thinks she has over a 16 year old's hair.", "He is 16, it is the kids decision.", "He should be taught to question his mother when she is being ridiculous!  He\u2019s two years from being treated by the legal system as an adult and needs to learn to think for himself, which he clearly can\u2019t do with his hysterical and grasping mother!  Maybe you\u2019ll understand one day if you ever respect your kids as their own people.", "Sometimes parents should not be listened to, especially when they are controlling and full of shit.", "The mother has exactly 0 authority over how that teenager has his hair cut. None. As the legal guardian, you're allowed an opinion, and as long as the kid does not rely on a financial contribution from your side to get it done, that's where it ends. You're not required to be a legal adult to pick a hairstyle.", "Her being controlling does make her the AH though. Her maybe having a hard time learning to let go may be a reason, but not an excuse for her behavior.", "It doesn't matter what she pays for. She shouldn't be dictating her 16 year old's haircut. At that age, you as a parent can have an opinion on that kind of stuff, and that's where it should end. You don't need to be a legal adult to walk into a barber shop and have your hair cut the way you want it, this is no different.", "How delusional are you?", "Again, it\u2019s not about the haircut.  Delusional is thinking it is.  Listen, not my kid, just adding my comment.  You don\u2019t have to agree.  Isn\u2019t that the point of this?  To allow everyone to give their opinion to OP so they can figure out what they should or shouldn\u2019t do?  Calm down.", "including cutting her controlling ass right out of his life, and probably rebelling aggressively against everything she's ever told him not to do", "If you can\u2019t do shit like that when you\u2019re 16, when can you do it? NTA and when that kid goes to college, he\u2019s going to wig out with the newfound freedom.", "My kid had a purple buzz cut in middle school. It was great.", "The only reason your sister should have any say in your nephews hair style is if she was paying for it (still controlling of course, but a little more understandable). Your nephew used your clippers to do it himself, so it literally cost everybody nothing. \n\nYour sister is being controlling here and honestly as long as your nephew is satisfied with his effort then that is all that really matters.", "That caught my attention too. \n\nI have yet to see a single thug with a buzz cut.\n\nMarines,  yes.\n\nArmy. Defo.\n\nNavy, yep.\n\nCoast guard, probably. \n\nThugs? No. Usually shoulder length and greasy (around here anyway). But never with a high n tight or a buzz.", "A soft YYTA\n\nYou overstepped yourself, id be pissed, you walked over a boundary and made a discission about her child and decided it meant nothing. \n\nNo matter the justification id be pissed. \n\nNow you have to live with the outcome.", "But not all cops.  My husband and I were homeless for about three years, and the cops we met were actually pretty nice people.", "True... You'll only be seen riding one while you're on it. That cat hair will be noticeable for months", "She encouraged it & even supplied the means to do it. He didn\u2019t just go out to a barber shop & get it on his own. She should have told him he\u2019d have to work that out when he got home. She didn\u2019t even hesitate to insert herself between him & his mom. This wasn\u2019t her problem to fix.", "Then you missed the point of what I wrote.", "Because purple hair is very uncommon. So he might stand out or get attention from it. Not a difficult dot to connect there.", "I've seen plenty of thugs with buzz cuts. Only some were cops or armed services. \n\nHe probably looks disgusting, tbh, but 16 is a great time to do that. It's his head.", "it\u2019s hair. the outcome is it will grow back. he\u2019s 16 ffs it\u2019s not that deep.", "Really shouldn\u2019t dye your balls man", "So what? Sixteen is the perfect age for wacky hairstyles.", "I get that, but Op has changed his relationship with his sister. As a parent Id be pissed.", "I think you\u2019re replying to the wrong person. I was answering a person who asked why someone would look at someone who had purple hair", "You literally asked a question based on a bunch of assumptions, and OP corrected you with facts. Maybe you should take your own advice and not ask questions if you're not ready for the answer. OP is allowed to disagree with feedback, especially if it's based on baseless assumptions.\n\n> sTiLl ArGuInG\n\nYeah, really mature reply you got going on there.", "Hello, welcome to Reddit. This is where people comment jump without hesitation.  The chances of the person you replied to being the person who replied to you are a maximum of 50/50.  Standard protocol.", "Haha", "His mother put herself in that position by being ridiculous"]}
