(Final?)", "selftext": "[OG POST\u203c\ufe0f](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j6z6n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_a_cake_for_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1)\n\n\nSo I posted here no much time ago and I feel it's correct to update all of you!\n\nI stood my ground and refused to do the cake. I actually made some cupcakes using Clara's cake decoration and turned it into graduation ones for my friends and their classmates. I posted it on ig yesterday and some family members blocked me because of it (mind to say there was a photo of two of my friends faking a proposal using one cupcake as the ring, and I post it with a text that said \"At least these two are getting a wedding dessert from me\". Petty, I know)\n\nAlso because yesterday was the wedding and, like I wasn't invited, I spent the day with my friends and later some uncles and cousins told me to at least I should've been respectful and stayed the evening at home. Stupid? Yes, did I tell them that? Of course! That's why they blocked me or straight up ignored me.\n\nThe important thing here: there was no cake in Clara's wedding. Guests who aren't from the family asked why there wasn't a cake and they made up a lot of things, such as \"Oh, we just don't wanted cake\" to \"The cake got accidentally destroyed when it was getting sent to here\", and they even tried to imply that Clara was pregnant by saying something among the lines that Clara was getting nauseous over the idea of fondant so that's why there's no cake.\n\nAnyways, the situation thankfully de-escalated and now everyone is calmed. I haven't been reached out about the cake (besides the cupcake thing), but my cousin told me that some people were mad because I didn't showed up with the cake. Like? I was uninvited, how tf they wanted me to show up and also with a free cake?! They're delulu just like Clara. \n\nBIL was so ashamed because of the lies Clara said about the cake and confessed me he's only one day being married and already thinking of divorce. I actually feel bad and told him that I got his back with whatever decision he makes.\n\nSo, that's all for this update! Thank you so much everyone for their words in my first post, it was really funny to see revenge ideas, and also a relief to see non-biased opinions on this situation since everyone was siding with Clara, and I was so close to surrender and make the cake. Actually, when I first posted I was preparing some flour and mix thinking \"this is it\", but then tons of people telling me not to fall into the gaslight and manipulation of Clara got me rethinking my decision and immediately stopped. \n\n\nThank you so much everyone.

And even then, a day later begged you to make the cake after she had burned her bridge with you.\n\nIn the end, she hurt herself, because what's a wedding without a cake?\n\nThe question is, why, with all the expenses attendant upon a wedding, did she single out the cake to be her cheating event? It wasn't even a sly cheat. It was a rage-filled one.\n\nWas there bad blood between you two? Some family thing?

She wasn't like this, we didn't treat each other that much but for what I saw she was very calm and treated everyone with respect. She has a strong personality, sure, but doesn't use it as an excuse to be an asshole with others. I get why BIL married her in first place, but suddenly everything changed.\n\nI told him not to worry about me and her since it's more of a deep family situation and we're eventually gonna get out of it, but she started to lie about a possible pregnancy, and (something I forgot to add in the update) how I couldn't attend her wedding because I was at the HOSPITAL, instead of just admitting she didn't wanted me there. It's her weddings, she decides who goes and who doesn't, and her decision is respectable, Idk why lying that much. That's why BIL is starting to get a bad feeling over her lying so casually and without remorse. Even that, if he talks it out with Clara and decides to work it out then it's more than okay.", "Sure sure. I already said that I'M, in fact, petty. I admitted it\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso I'm not excited, BIL is the one who told me \"Well, I'm updating you the day I divorce her (since he's GENUINELY debating it) so you can say it on reddit\" (I didn't told him about the post, he found it himself), so that last line is pretty much just a joke between us that I know he's gonna see.
