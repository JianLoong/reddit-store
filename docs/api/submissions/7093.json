That's not going to change. Are you really ok with that?", "We wonder why MIL is being divorced. NTA.", "Yeah, this is never going to get better.", "\\*Boy run.\n\nSamesame tho", "Ugh, get a magic wand. It\u2019s cheaper.", "The problem is he knows what she\u2019s like but he just doesn\u2019t care that it bothers you. You should not be in a relationship like that.", "Just break up with him. His lack of boundaries with her mother will never change. Moreover, it will just continue to get worse.\n\nImagine having children with this man\u2026and his overbearing mother", "You need to leave.  Period.  The red flags are bigger than the ones used on stage in Les Miz!  Run far, run fast, and don\u2019t look back.  This situation will never get better.", "NTA.  You should leave, whether mom comes or not.", "NTA.\n\nBut do yourself a favor and leave this mama's boy for good, if he can't stand up for you now, he never will. Move out and let him and mommy have their fun.", "You don't have a mother problem, you have a bf problem. Sadly, you gotta dump him because this is not going to get better.", "\"Finally he called his mom saying that he can't let her stay cause I don't agree with it...\"\n\nThrowing you under the bus.\n\nPersonally, I'd tell her she's fine living with her son but not until the weekend since you want time to get away from the toxic hostility (if the rent/house/whatever is in his name) or you're sure that he'd love to have her come help him move out of your home.\n\nNTA", "Currently you're being an asshole to yourself staying in a relationship with someone who's already married to their mother. Break up and move on", "NTA- this is definitely a case of \"if you give a mouse a cookie\"", "Seriously tho, dump him. Don't date momma's boy.", "RUN", "OP: you don\u2019t have a mother in law problem, you have a boyfriend problem because he\u2019s not defending you from abuse. You need to seriously reconsider this relationship.", "NTA - time to bail on that relationship. Sure he may be a sweet and nice guy buuuuut the way he behaves around his mother? Yeah no\u2026she\u2019s already judging and deem you not fit for her son. She\u2019s the type that, if and when, you have kids it\u2019s going be HER BABIES, not yours. Be like Jordan Peele NOPE and GET OUT!", "can we get a Valentine\u2019s Day update looool", "NTA. Dude you're 25, you can do better than some pathetic mama's boy without a spine and his overbearing nightmare of a mother.", "And why she's getting divorced.", "So why are you still in the relationship?? You haven't answered The question.\n\nCongratulations, you found out he tricked you, and you're still staying with him? Given how entwined the relationship is, he was deliberately hiding it from you until you moved in together. Break up with him. He doesn't see it as toxic because he likes the dynamic", "Congratulations, now you understand that you are talking with her because they are a package. Break up", "Indeed, and if you're someone who can't handle that there are so many toy options on the market.", "And then you have to keep talking with them about the show because they really just wanted to get you to watch it so they could talk about it, so not only are you spending all this time  watching those episodes, but you also spend hours of your time listening to them have one sided rants about this show.\n\nIf that sounds exhausting, imagine signing up to do that forever.", "Seriously, sex toys are cheap, and peace is valuable. Why stay in a relationship with someone who's already married to their parent? Why would you be a third in a relationship where the other two are a very clear team who are both screwing you over?", "NTA. Take this as a sign and get out now. THIS is as GOOD as it will ever be, it will only get worse from her and it already sounds horrendous.  You deserve a life where you are the number one priority. Your bf does not spend time with you, his mom is mean to you, why are you with him?", "Break up with him.", "NTA leave this Oedipal loser I promise you can do better", "NTA- repeat to dear mom all the criticisms She\u2019s given to you over the years as why she shouldn\u2019t stay at your house, like it\u2019s not clean enough she doesn\u2019t like this, or that. Tell her she would be extremely uncomfortable and so would you.", "NTA\n\nSeriously. Leave. \n\nYour bf will never put you first and will always throw you under the bus. He doesn\u2019t care about your wants or needs.", "NTA Wow just wow! Run!", "NTA First, your BF should shut his mothers diatribes down and not allow her to speak to you the way she does. Second, he needs to grow a spine and tell her to stop dropping by whenever she feels like it. She\u2019s getting divorced? Big surprise. If she treats her husband even a small amount of the way she treats you, a divorce was inevitable. Stay with you? Absolutely not! And it wouldn\u2019t be for just a few weeks. Once she was in she wouldn\u2019t ever leave. Also, if you\u2019re in the US, some jurisdictions state that a stay of 3 consecutive nights establishes residency and to get them out you\u2019d have to go through a legal eviction process. Stand firm in your resolve and don\u2019t let her move in. I\u2019ll warn you, though, you\u2019re going to come home in the very near future and she\u2019s going to be moved in. Your BF is so much a mommas boy that she\u2019s just going to show up and he won\u2019t say no, no matter how you feel about it.", "NTA. But, my dude. My guy. Leave this boy. He is allowing his mother to verbally abuse you and violate your private spaces. In fact, he is inviting her to do so. \n\nThis relationship is not worth it. He showed you who he is. Believe him.", "NTA, but it's this a situation you really want to be in? Your bf should have your back, not let you be abused by Mommy Dearest.", "You need to break up. Now. NTA", "Oh my dear OP=NTA\n\nbut just end it now, it will never get better and this is WEEKLY?  Being abused by his mother while he does nothing to defend you.\n\nI don't care if he is the sweetest man in the world otherwise and showers you with affection, can you really tell me that 52 times(plus holidays?) a year that you want to suffer through this?\n\nAnd eventually he might wear you down, can you imagine daily denigration?", "Omg let her come, and leave already! What is there to stay for? Your bf already lost me that he won\u2019t get off his games for you. He sounds like a boring loser. His mom can have him.", "YTA - to yourself. This isn't going to get better, are you planning on building a life with this person? What's the hope, she dies and he's suddenly fixed? Life's too short to live like this. Set yourself free", "So leave???\nYou're not a tree, you're not stuck there. Find another house and another boyfriend. You sound amazing and badass, don't stay too longer than you have or they will snuff that out of you.", ">A friend recommended a show to me and I got through about 2.5 episodes before I gave up  \n>  \n>WHY? because the \"Villian\" who was repossessing people's gold fillings was the most likeable character I'd yet seen at that point."]}
