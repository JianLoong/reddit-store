It wasn\u2019t an accident, it was drunken stupidity. Stupidity she found funny, which doesn\u2019t say good things about her character considering what she intentionally broke was someone\u2019s wheelchair. In either case, you break it, you buy it. If the money needs to be taken out of her college fund, so be it. Since she\u2019s off to college, it\u2019s time for her to learn that drunk or sober, the stupid crap you do has consequences.\n\nNow, you\u2019re being kind. You are offering to have them pay for it before taking them directly to court, which could have given her a destruction of property on her record.\n\nThis situation is none of your extended family\u2019s concern. They get a vote on absolutely nothing. Their opinion here means zero in this situation, and it is not okay for your wife to bring others into this as an attempt to outrank you. \n\nThe three opinions that matter here are:\n\nYours\n\nYour wife\n\nYour son\n\nNow, if you\u2019re on the fence about this, you can always ask Charlie if he\u2019d feel okay with having them pay half the cost. The parents aren\u2019t out nearly as much money, Annie gets consequences (hopefully the money would still come out of her college account, as this was her mess to clean up), and your wife can feel a bit better, and Charlie has some measure of justice. But after that suggestion, I would go with what Charlie wants. Someone acted callous toward someone with a disability, and I think he has a right to make the final decision.\n\nBut letting them get off without paying a dime is saying that it\u2019s completely okay for this young woman to act drunk and be cruel. If anything, you are doing her a disservice. By making her face some kind of consequence, you are teaching her a life lesson she\u2019s in desperate need of receiving. Life shouldn\u2019t reward the cruel.", "NTA - there are consequences to actions and that\u2019s a lesson that Annie is going to have to learn. If she\u2019s old enough to drink, she\u2019s old enough to be accountable for her behavior", "NTA. Perhaps it wasn't the wisest decision for Charlie and his friends to go into the club despite it not being wheelchair-accessible, but that's irrelevant because that didn't break the chair. (Incidentally, it sounds like Charlie has great friends.)\n\nWhat *did* break the chair was another group of people deciding to play with something that not only wasn't theirs (which by itself would make them the AHs) but was also a mobility aid (which makes them even bigger AHs) and *push it down the stairs*. (What did they expect to happen?? Did they think it would sprout wings and fly away to safety?) **You don't screw around with someone's mobility aid.**\n\nAnnie was drunk? Charlie left the chair unattended? Annie's parents are \"tight on money\"? None of those things matter. They broke it, so they should pay for it. It's as simple as that. If paying for it will cause them financial hardship then they should have thought of that before deciding to touch something that didn't belong to them. Paying for something after breaking it is neither cruel nor unusual, let it be an expensive lesson to respect other peoples' property.\n\nYour wife is willing to place Annie's parents' financial convenience over her own son's mobility. She needs to fix her priorities.", "NTA\n\nIf Annie had broken the chair helping to carry it up/down that is one thing but it was broken through drunken antics. That\u2019s a behavior that need\u2019s consequences. \n\nWas Annie in a group or did she do this alone? If it is a group it should be split amongst the group. If not, and since you can afford to front the cost\u2026it might be prudent to have Annie pay you back on a payment plan.", "NTA.  Would she prefer to go to jail for destruction of property first and have to pay for it via restitution?", "NTA...but that girl Annie is most definitely. What kind of person breaks the wheelchair of a handicapped person, drunk or not? My god.", "NTA - let the court decide how she will set up a payment structure for this. There is typically an agency within the court that will do this even if she can\u2019t pay it right away.\n\nThis is the best demonstration of our actions having consequences. She had no regard for whom the chair belonged to, nor how detrimental it would be. Why should she be afforded mercy? She did not convey the same. It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s offered a solution as such.", "No judgement. I watched a video on public freakout with this very same thing, except it was guys that pushed the wheelchair down steps at a club.", "NTA - Annie is 100% responsible for the replacement. This has nothing to do with your ability to pay. That\u2019s just a poor attempt to lay guilt on you.\n\nMaybe their efforts would be better spent teaching Annie responsibility.", "Brand new account and posts up the identical story from a front page artical today but from a different point of view. Get fucked loser.", "NTA and ***N.F.W.*** do you let her get away with wrecking his wheelchair on purpose.  She destroyed the means of transportation of a disabled person, knowingly and intentionally, this absolutely ***SHOULD*** be pulled from her college fund, hopefully she'll have to get a job or a loan and earn it back herself, and her parents trying to bully you into paying for her intentional vandalism victimizing your son is over the top and shows where she got her missing sense of right and wrong.", "NTA - The family can afford to fix the chair their daughter broke through her drunken stupidity--they just don't want to access the resources to do so.  Too bad, so sad--actions, please let me introduce you to consequences.\n\nThe fact that your son left the chair unattended did not give Annie or anyone else a license to throw it down a freaking flight of stairs.  If Annie behaves this stupidly when she is drunk, maybe this will be a wakeup call to avoid making such poor choices in the future.  Anyone with a grain of sense knows that wheelchairs exist for people who need them and who can be left in dire straits without them.  Her parents can make her work off the debt to her sister's college account via giving up allowance, getting a job or working more hours--whatever they want.  This is a them issue for not raising their daughter better.", "NTA. These people you\u2019re dealing with are the worst for two reasons. \n\n1. Annie\u2019s actions weren\u2019t stupid, they were incredibly cruel. And her parents are clearly ableist to minimize the act by calling it a stupid mistake. If Annie has instead went up to a non-disabled person and did something to *take away their mobility*, no one would be calling it \u201cONE mistake while drunk,\u201d they\u2019d be calling it disgusting and unhinged, because that\u2019s what it is. \n\n2. No remorse. If they were actually sorry, the parents would have immediately apologized, not asking for a meeting to \u201csettle this.\u201d Beyond that it sounds like they were apologizing to try to get out of the consequences, and not apologizing because they were actually sorry. \n\nWay to defend your kid. Sue their asses.", "NTA. She broke it, she pays for it. I had someone take my bike without asking and break it and she also could barely afford it but she gave us a 100 bucks to replace it. It wasn't technically enough but it paid most of the cost.\n\nIt's one of those things that people have to learn .", "NTA.\n\nHer parents are crying over that \"one mistake\" as if their daughter is about to be executed. What is happening instead is that she faces a steep financial penalty and that's it. No criminal record for vandalism. As far as \"one mistake\" goes, that is a very reasonable lesson for her to learn.", "NTA - if Annie was at a bar, she\u2019s an adult and she\u2019s responsible for her actions.", "NTA. Mistakes have consequences, even if you \"only made one\" and even \"if you were drunk.\" That's literally why we arrest people for drunk driving.", "NTA also if you have a college fund money isn't that tight", "NTA. Annie or her family need to pay. They have the money; they just don\u2019t want to use it for *this.* \n\nIf you went to court, the other family would lose, and I suspect they know it.", "pretty sure this is a bait post since i just watched a video a few minutes ago where this exact thing happened, but it was college boys who pushed the chair, not girls", "I just saw a tiktok of security footage from a club and it had a guy (I think it was a guy, I can\u2019t find the video now) pushing a wheelchair down a flight of stairs and the caption had almost all the same info as this post.

His wants and needs are what matters here. \n\nAnnie did a shitty thing, something she knew was wrong.

It\u2019s an expensive motorized one, but it helps him have independence. \n\nRecently, he and his friends went to a club for the first time and unfortunately, it was not wheelchair accessible. The club was on the second floor of the building and there were no elevators. They didn\u2019t think to call ahead, but Charlie told me that since they were already there he didn\u2019t want to spoil the night. His boyfriend carried him up the stairs while a few others carried his wheelchair up.\n\nLater in the night Charlie needed to use the bathroom, so he and his boyfriend went out and he was carried down the stairs since the bathroom was on the first floor. They left the wheelchair unattended at the top of the stairs. \n\nBut when they came out of the bathroom, the wheelchair was at the base of the stairs and it was broken. Obviously Charlie was devastated and wanted to know what happened, so they asked to see the security footage. The footage showed a girl with her friends playing around with the chair and eventually, one girl pushed it down the stairs. They were laughing and seemed drunk. \n\nOne of Charlie\u2019s friends knew the girl who pushed it, Annie, from a class and messaged her over social media to ask for an explanation. Annie didn\u2019t respond. At this point my wife and I got involved and found Annie\u2019s parents\u2019 contact information. We contacted them through our lawyer and demanded they pay for the cost of the wheelchair, otherwise we\u2019d take them to small claims court. \n\nAnnie\u2019s parents responded and asked to meet with us to settle this. We agreed and asked them to come to our house with our lawyer present. Once they came over, Annie started crying and apologized for what she did. She said she was drunk and wasn\u2019t thinking. Annie\u2019s parents also apologized, but they said that they couldn\u2019t pay for the chair. They said that they were tight on money and couldn\u2019t afford the cost. I said tough luck, but consequences are consequences. They tried to guilt us by saying they\u2019d have to pull from their other daughter\u2019s college fund to pay, but I kept saying that there are consequences for your actions. Annie\u2019s parents then got upset and started yelling that it was Charlie\u2019s fault since he left the chair unattended, we were being cruel and unreasonable, that Annie made ONE mistake while drunk, and they weren\u2019t going to pay, at which point our lawyer made them leave. \n\nWe were planning to file in small claims the next day, but my wife took me aside after Annie and her parents left and told me that since we could afford the cost of a new chair, we shouldn\u2019t make the entire family suffer for Annie\u2019s mistake. We asked Charlie for his opinion and he wants them to pay. I think his opinion is what matters most but my wife and some extended family keep trying to convince me otherwise, so I don\u2019t know. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. I would NOT compromise by paying half. Sue for all costs - the full cost of a new chair plus legal fees and any rental fees associated with getting a loaner etc. The chair was undamaged when you went to pee, and now it's trash thanks to Annie. I have zero sympathy for having to pull money out of her college fund to pay. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. And even if they had no money, if you break it, you pay it.", "Nta\n\nYou can't let someone get away with these types of actions. If they get away with it they will continue such behaviour cause I don't think she learnt her lesson at all. As the parents like to make excuses it's one mistake. That's all it can take and you stuffed up. It's a good lesson to learn for the long run", "NTA.\nMatter of fact, it's possible that club has security video that caught this. That would certainly strengthen your case in court.\n\nBut yes, they can talk to your lawyers, and they can talk to the court. Sue them. Actions have consequences. She's lucky you don't file criminal charges against her. You probably still could...", "Not only would I file small claims court,  I'd file criminal charges.  Depending on where you are, what she did is a fairly big deal\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. Annie didn't break the chair by mistake, she did it intentionally, for fun. What kind of person does something like this? She needs to learn consequences. \nAlso, the family CAN afford it (since there's a college fund), they just don't want to pay. They could take money from the college fund and ask Annie to get a part time job to repay it. It's not like you're leaving them homeless and hungry.", "NTA, but what about negotiating a payment plan until the debt is cleared? I agree with others that she needs to be responsible for her actions.", "Remarkably similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/11ru13h/mercyhurst_university_hockey_player_pushing_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) story", "NTA if you let this girl get away with no consequences for her actions she will not learn a lesson and will go through life with a cry a few tears it was an accident entitled attitude, your son wants her to pay and so she should she needs to learn a lesson as well as her parents who are raising a very spoiled entitled daughter", "NTA. You break it, you pay to fix it. 100% on Annie, if she is a minor, her parents are responsible.", "NTA for several reasons.   \n\n\n1. Annie did this and there's video footage so Annie is liable.\n2. Doesn't matter if Annie is drunk. I've been drunk multiple times and have never caused property damage or driven drunk or any other similar action drunk people blame on alcohol. \n3. So they don't have money but are saying if they had to pay, they'd have to take it from Annie's college fund? Oh so there is money! Even more of a reason to cough it up.\n4. The most important point is it does NOT matter if it's left unattended. Cars are left unattended in these things called parking lots. Is Annie not liable if she smashes up some windshields or side mirrors or keys them?", "NTA frankly college fund would be a waste on her.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA. My reasoning for saying that is Charlie and Annie were both in a club. So, I'm assuming they're over the age of 18.  Frankly if Charlie and Annie are both old enough to go to a club they are old enough to take care of this between themselves and you and Annie's parents should not be involved. And even if you want to be involved her parents have nothing to do with this if she is over the age of 18, it's all on Annie. And finally just remember this, and I'm surprised your lawyer didn't tell you the same, if they don't have money, they don't have money, so you're not going to get it, even if awarded damages in small claims court. You do realize they can file for bankruptcy and their debt will be cleared.  Your son is better off suing the club this incident occurred in for not having an accessible areas for the disabled and or inadequate security.", "Hope the incident was caught on tape and there were 3 people messing with the wheelchair, 1 walked away but the other 2 had their hands on it as it flew downstairs.  Hope the lawyers see the 2 people directly involved with the damage done.", "NTA. \n\nSo if I leave my car unattended, she can be drunk and wreck it because she was drunk? \n\n\n> Annie started crying and apologized for what she did. She said she was drunk and wasn\u2019t thinking. Annie\u2019s parents also apologized, but they said that they couldn\u2019t pay for the chair. \n\nThat's a good start.  They apologized and offered an explanation (*not* an excuse).   Also, lots of people can't afford the things they break, accidentally or intentionally.   It doesn't give them a free pass.  They make payments, or use credit cards, or sell some other items to raise the cash, or take out a loan. \n\n\n> They said that they were tight on money and couldn\u2019t afford the cost. I said tough luck, but consequences are consequences. \n\nBummer for them. Maybe the kid should have thought about that.   Your comment is correct. \n\n\n> They tried to guilt us by saying they\u2019d have to pull from their other daughter\u2019s college fund to pay,\n\nWho cares where the money comes from?  Your son shouldn't be able to go anywhere because \"they might be tight on money\"?\n\n\n> Annie\u2019s parents then got upset and started yelling that it was Charlie\u2019s fault since he left the chair unattended, we were being cruel and unreasonable, that Annie made ONE mistake while drunk, and they weren\u2019t going to pay, \n\n\n\nAaaahhhh, there it is.  Now THEY get upset, and blame-shift.  YOU GUYS are cruel and unreasonable.   Not the person who effectively prevents your child from going places. \n\nCourt. Garnish wages if that's what it takes. \n\nSure, you have the money. That's great, you can replace the chair and get your kid back out and not stuck in the house - but THEY need to reimburse you for that cost.   It's just LUCKY that you can afford the chair.  What if you couldn't?", "NTA.\nIf I had done something like that as a kid my parents would have marched me to the police station themselves & then put me to work.", "NTA\n\nThey literally took away his ability to get around and laughed about it on footage. \u201cTouch luck\u201d and \u201cactions have consequences\u201d are more than appropriate.", "NTA Annie will not learn that there are consequences to her actions, drunk or sober. She is responsible for her actions. I would take them to small claims court to get the judgement, but then offer to work out a payment plan. That Annie has to pay. Not her parents.", "NTA\n\nBut Annie is the one who broke the wheelchair and I think Annie is the one who should pay for it. If you guys can afford to pay for it right away, have Annie + her family put on a payment plan to pay you back slowly. This way the other daughter isn't punished for this.", "NTA\n\nWhether or not you can afford to replace the chair yourselves isn\u2019t the issue. What if you couldn\u2019t? Would  Charlie just have to suffer without it because Annie thought it would be funny to destroy something he needs to be mobile? If you are old enough to drink at a club, you are old enough to know that a wheelchair is expensive medical equipment that would not survive a trip down the stairs. She needs to get a job and set up a payment plan. Good on you for taking your son\u2019s opinion on this matter seriously.", "NTA. They break it, they buy it.", "NTA. Their mistake, their problem.", "NTA,\nYou could compromise by making them pay half if it'll make some people in your story feel a little better, but Annie doesn't get to get away with something by excusing it on being drunk. I've been absolutely sloshed plenty of times and never destroyed property ESPECIALLY not a wheel chair. That's not drunk behavior, that's mean girl behavior and she should pay.", "What a strange coincidence that OP's story is the same as a popular front page post.  Topical!", "yeah me too. carson briere (danny briere's kid) did almost the exact same thing", "This. Fictional post.", "Because some people just suck...", "The club does have security footage. That\u2019s how they figured out who pushed it.", "Exactly what I thought", "Yeah I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit. Been a lot of these lately.", "Lol i was looking for the video, i call bs in this story, someone just want to write a story.\n\nEdit: would you look at that, already deleted lol.", "And being intoxicated isn't an excuse because she CHOSE to drink that much", "I agree, except they do have the money in a college fund.  The court won't exempt that money.", "Good, let them file for bankruptcy, or let Annie, the parents or both have that judgment on their credit, they tried to bully OP and make it out to be his son's fault that their drunken ass hole of a daughter intentionally destroyed a disabled person's wheelchair.  \n\nNo, no, no, fuck her and fuck the parents trying to let her damage other people, I can't even believe you would defend this honestly.  She, her parents, or both, need to pay, and if they can't pay, they deserve the consequences of getting sued and having the judgment sent to collections.", "I disagree on compromising. These people shouldn't get away with only paying for half of the damage they caused, laughed about, and then became abusive over. They shouldn't get to feel good about any of it.", "Either they copied or are coincidentally the same people", "If Annie is over 18 it is not her parents' financial responsibility.", "I'm not defending anyone, only pointing out, if Annie is over the age of 18, her parents have absolutely no financial responsibility whatsoever for what happened.", "Oh don't me wrong-- she should pay the whole bit, but I also recognize this may help the wife to feel a bit better"]}
