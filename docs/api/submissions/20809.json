She sells those things and buys even more bits instead.\n\nI don't go out so I shop online and if I see a cute pair of PJ's with a character on then I'd buy it, but she then sells it because it's not a character he knows, he's 1 I don't think he would know or care what picture was on his Pjs he is going to bed in.\n\nBecause he likes bluey she thinks he only likes wearing bluey clothes, I've bought him bluey things but there's only so much you can buy in one theme, so would buy for example Chuggington or Bing PJ's if I saw them, they are the exact same style she buys just not all bluey ones, which I'd also bought.\n\nMy daughters reasoning is he's not watched them so doesn't know who they are so she sells them on Vinted.\nMy reasoning is he's 1 and wouldn't care or notice what was on his Pjs it could be Barbie and he wouldn't care.\n\nShe says I buy quantity over quality which I found rude as nothing I buy is cheap rubbish and it's all nice she then replaces it all with more things on vinted, but if someone's bought you a gift I'd at least let him wear them and then sell them on vinted after, especially as I send her photos and say do you like this or that etc .. and don't buy the things she doesnt like.\n\nShe cannot understand at all why I'm a bit upset, he's my first grandson I've got 5 children so I know which clothes are ideal for babies and that as parents we all have a certain style we like so I make sure I stick to hers, and would never buy a completely different style clothing to what he usually wears. \n\nIf she had a completely unique style she liked I'd buy that style but she puts him in the exact style I buy but sells all the new ones I get if they don't have bluey or paddington on.\nIt's so hard getting just those characters in clothes you are really limited.\n\nShe also sells any toys that are not bluey or paddington, I'd already bought loads of those ones for him from her wishlist aswell but some other things aswell, so she sold the other ones.\n\nI'm going to stop buying things now as it's not appreciated at all and is sold straight away and I will just buy a select few items in the theme she will only accept, it will save me money anyway but I'm just upset about how much I've already spent that went straight online.\n\nShe thinks there's nothing at all wrong with doing what she does and has no remorse and is totally unapologetic which is fine that's her opinion, but am I the arsehole for being slightly offended nearly all my gifts go on vinted ?", "created_utc": 1687955620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8b4s/aita_my_daughter_sells_nearly_everything_i_buy/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Think I'll buy it if you think y'all can use it.\"  Just got to go back and think about how my parents would try to \"raise my kids for me\" rather than let me make all the decisions, and that included their clothes.

I was also going to throw a shot in the dark and suggest she may be under financial strain and you are unaware.\n\nBut the more I read, the more it seems she is dead set on a certain style or motif for her child and that is that.  The fact that she wants this style is fine, the fact that you buy stuff outside of this style is fine.  BUT, her continually selling what you buy says one of two things;\n\n* She has told you multiple times to stop buying other stuff and you dont listen, so she rolls with it and buys something along the style she wants for her child\n* She is a very ungrateful person and cares nothing about your feelings\n\nThis is such an easy fix, JUST STOP BUYING", "INFO: Since you like to buy stuff your your grandson, why don't you ask her what does he need? like a backpack , stroller, etc...

Immediately selling what you buy isnt cool though but, tbh it might be because she has too much. \n\nAlso the \u201cive got five kids so I know which clothes are ideal for babies\u201d really stuck out. Yes, you raised kids but now its your daughters turn, so do you think maybe youre being a little over bearing?", "YTA - Stop buying stuff. Overloading them with stuff that they can't use, don't want, or don't have room for is not helpful. And if you are not buying them stuff to be helpful, why are you doing it? \n\nYou need to change your attitude ASAP if you want to keep a good relationship. Saying \"Because he likes bluey **she thinks** he only likes wearing bluey clothes\" - this should not be \"she thinks\", this should be \"she said\" and since she is the mother, what she says goes. You raised 5 children. But you are not raising her child. She is the mother. I am not saying that your experience doesn't have value, but she is the one who has experience with her child. By ignoring what she says you are undermining her role as mother. \n\nTry actually listening to them when they tell you what they want/need. \n\nAlso - while it is generous to buy things for new parents, they often get inundated with stuff picked out by other people. Sometimes they just want to pick out the things for themselves. You get joy out of buying things for your grandson and seeing him use those thing - don't you think they want they too? \n\nIf you want to be helpful - buy them diapers/wipes/etc.", "Does she need money?   I\u2019d say instead of being hurt (and I get it, I have grandchildren). Start a college fund or savings account for him instead and contribute to that every month/birthdays/Christmas.   That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t buy him a gift, but something small would be fine.  He\u2019d probably be happy with an empty box at this age.   Then, when he gets older, continue with the contributions into his college fund, but make gifts to him experiences instead of things.   I do that now with my oldest grandson.   His birthday is usually a week or two at baseball camp, and this year for something different, we took an archery class.   Family passes to local museums, the zoo, or even a long weekend at the beach.   \n\nYou aren\u2019t going to win the battle of you buying things and your daughter thinking they are junk/ unnecessary/he won\u2019t like them or whatever.   Beat her at her own game.  Or ask her what would be a good thing to buy for him, what does she need to make life with a baby easier?", "ESH", "NAH. It's understandable that you're upset by this, but gifts are just that - gifts. Once you give somebody a gift, it's up to them whether they keep it and use it or sell it or donate it. It's not fair to insist that someone keep/use a gift in exactly the way you want them to, especially if it's not something they asked for or wanted. If it's important to you that all your gifts are kept and used, only get them things you know she/they want.", "NTA. If she doesn\u2019t want those gifts she can use her words.", ". Despite your best intentions, you've been stomping on your daughter's boundaries as a new parent.\n\nLet her be the Parent to HER child.
