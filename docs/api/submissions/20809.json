She sells those things and buys even more bits instead.\n\nI don't go out so I shop online and if I see a cute pair of PJ's with a character on then I'd buy it, but she then sells it because it's not a character he knows, he's 1 I don't think he would know or care what picture was on his Pjs he is going to bed in.\n\nBecause he likes bluey she thinks he only likes wearing bluey clothes, I've bought him bluey things but there's only so much you can buy in one theme, so would buy for example Chuggington or Bing PJ's if I saw them, they are the exact same style she buys just not all bluey ones, which I'd also bought.\n\nMy daughters reasoning is he's not watched them so doesn't know who they are so she sells them on Vinted.\nMy reasoning is he's 1 and wouldn't care or notice what was on his Pjs it could be Barbie and he wouldn't care.\n\nShe says I buy quantity over quality which I found rude as nothing I buy is cheap rubbish and it's all nice she then replaces it all with more things on vinted, but if someone's bought you a gift I'd at least let him wear them and then sell them on vinted after, especially as I send her photos and say do you like this or that etc .. and don't buy the things she doesnt like.\n\nShe cannot understand at all why I'm a bit upset, he's my first grandson I've got 5 children so I know which clothes are ideal for babies and that as parents we all have a certain style we like so I make sure I stick to hers, and would never buy a completely different style clothing to what he usually wears. \n\nIf she had a completely unique style she liked I'd buy that style but she puts him in the exact style I buy but sells all the new ones I get if they don't have bluey or paddington on.\nIt's so hard getting just those characters in clothes you are really limited.\n\nShe also sells any toys that are not bluey or paddington, I'd already bought loads of those ones for him from her wishlist aswell but some other things aswell, so she sold the other ones.\n\nI'm going to stop buying any extra things now not on the list as it's not appreciated at all and is sold straight away and I will just buy a select few items in the theme she will only accept, it will save me money anyway but I'm just upset about how much I've already spent that went straight online.\n\nShe thinks there's nothing at all wrong with doing what she does and has no remorse and is totally unapologetic which is fine that's her opinion, but am I the arsehole for being slightly offended nearly all my gifts go on vinted ?", "created_utc": 1687955620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8b4s/aita_my_daughter_sells_nearly_everything_i_buy/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Think I'll buy it if you think y'all can use it.\"  Just got to go back and think about how my parents would try to \"raise my kids for me\" rather than let me make all the decisions, and that included their clothes.

I was also going to throw a shot in the dark and suggest she may be under financial strain and you are unaware.\n\nBut the more I read, the more it seems she is dead set on a certain style or motif for her child and that is that.  The fact that she wants this style is fine, the fact that you buy stuff outside of this style is fine.  BUT, her continually selling what you buy says one of two things;\n\n* She has told you multiple times to stop buying other stuff and you dont listen, so she rolls with it and buys something along the style she wants for her child\n* She is a very ungrateful person and cares nothing about your feelings\n\nThis is such an easy fix, JUST STOP BUYING", "INFO: Since you like to buy stuff your your grandson, why don't you ask her what does he need? like a backpack , stroller, etc...

Immediately selling what you buy isnt cool though but, tbh it might be because she has too much. \n\nAlso the \u201cive got five kids so I know which clothes are ideal for babies\u201d really stuck out. Yes, you raised kids but now its your daughters turn, so do you think maybe youre being a little over bearing?", "YTA - Stop buying stuff. Overloading them with stuff that they can't use, don't want, or don't have room for is not helpful. And if you are not buying them stuff to be helpful, why are you doing it? \n\nYou need to change your attitude ASAP if you want to keep a good relationship. Saying \"Because he likes bluey **she thinks** he only likes wearing bluey clothes\" - this should not be \"she thinks\", this should be \"she said\" and since she is the mother, what she says goes. You raised 5 children. But you are not raising her child. She is the mother. I am not saying that your experience doesn't have value, but she is the one who has experience with her child. By ignoring what she says you are undermining her role as mother. \n\nTry actually listening to them when they tell you what they want/need. \n\nAlso - while it is generous to buy things for new parents, they often get inundated with stuff picked out by other people. Sometimes they just want to pick out the things for themselves. You get joy out of buying things for your grandson and seeing him use those thing - don't you think they want they too? \n\nIf you want to be helpful - buy them diapers/wipes/etc.", "Does she need money?   I\u2019d say instead of being hurt (and I get it, I have grandchildren). Start a college fund or savings account for him instead and contribute to that every month/birthdays/Christmas.   That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t buy him a gift, but something small would be fine.  He\u2019d probably be happy with an empty box at this age.   Then, when he gets older, continue with the contributions into his college fund, but make gifts to him experiences instead of things.   I do that now with my oldest grandson.   His birthday is usually a week or two at baseball camp, and this year for something different, we took an archery class.   Family passes to local museums, the zoo, or even a long weekend at the beach.   \n\nYou aren\u2019t going to win the battle of you buying things and your daughter thinking they are junk/ unnecessary/he won\u2019t like them or whatever.   Beat her at her own game.  Or ask her what would be a good thing to buy for him, what does she need to make life with a baby easier?", "ESH", "NAH. It's understandable that you're upset by this, but gifts are just that - gifts. Once you give somebody a gift, it's up to them whether they keep it and use it or sell it or donate it. It's not fair to insist that someone keep/use a gift in exactly the way you want them to, especially if it's not something they asked for or wanted.

Kids are kids so they're obviously super happy even with that stuff, but I had to tell them no and toss the stuff because it's gross and dangerous even if I deep clean it because it's broken, hence why the stuff was in the garbage in the first place. \n\nThis was a few years ago, shortly after she followed my druggie sister into a meth addiction, and I had to ban her from being around my kids because I can't have them exposed to that kind of life. \n\nPoint is, you're a generous, loving grandma, well done. If she doesn't appreciate it, put the money elsewhere, into an account for the baby or maybe buying cute pajamas for other babies who don't have grandmas like you. My local pregnancy crisis center has a boutique for underprivileged moms to shop with the points they get from taking parenting classes. It's a really nice place and only possible through donations from thoughtful people like yourself.", "It sounds like you mean well, but you're probably overloading your daughter. You said in the post why should she care about the characters on his PJs because he's 1 and won't remember. Same logic can apply to you. Why spend all this money buying him stuff he won't remember and won't fit into 4 weeks from now. If you want to do something nice for your grandson, take the money you're spending on excess clothes and toys and put it into some kind of account he can use for college or buying a home or getting married when he grows up. That will be a much better use of your money.", "Does any of this really matter?  The solution for you is to stop buying the clothes and instead ask her if she would like your help.  I honestly find this sad and petty.  If you want to contribute either keep doing what you are and stop whinging because once you give her the clothes she has the right as the mother to do what she likes, or ask her what you can buy.  Also tell her how hurt you are.  Stop the pettiness - both of you have a lot to give to this child.  All the best.", "Has she told you what she is buying on the site with the money she gets from selling the extra gifts?", "It\u2019s ok if the daughter knows she just can\u2019t have access to it", "OP says it's off the wishlist and if it's not on there she sends pics and asks. That's what I am talking about.", "I'm sticking to the list from now on lol, I wish she had told me she only wanted those things but she knew I'd bought lots more and was fine with it and then sold them all. She prefers selling new things apparently as they make more money and she can buy more stuff.", "Babies don't need seven million pajamas and toys either. I agree a savings account is a great idea to add to over time!", "This. We\u2019ve been asking my parents to just gift money to our daughters college fund. Instead my mom shows up with a bag full of clothes nearly every time she visits. And you know what? My 1 year old has worn a fraction of those clothes because she grows so damn fast she 1) can\u2019t possibly wear them all and 2) some baby clothes are clearly designed by people who don\u2019t have kids. \n\nI\u2019d love to sell it all. But I\u2019ll always advocate putting aside some $$ for her future.", "This is not true, but may be for her situation. I cherished everything my parents bought for my babies and a lot of them are keepsakes now that my kids are older. Don\u2019t speak for everyone here. I think her daughters being incredibly rude. He can\u2019t wear them one two times? They\u2019re fricken pjs. But if she doesn\u2019t want these things then she should stop asking her to buy stuff from a damn wishlist and just ask for cash or a clothing gift card where she can go buy her own damn clothes since she\u2019s so picky.", "I will buy stuff but only on the wish list and not the extras. She bought double the amount of clutter with the money she made from selling the gifts so I don't think that's the reason", "What a fantastic idea, I just love buying things for people I'd rather it if she had donated the things she didn't want or give them to someone who needed them rather than selling them for her own profit. I've got things I've already bought him put by for Christmas that I now know she will sell so I'm going to donate them instead, thankyou for such a lovely idea, sending much love to you \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "\u201cPERHAPS the mother of the baby is just as excited about her own baby as you, someone with five kids.\u201d\n\nWow, guys.", "Then grandma should include a gift receipt.", "No the daughter shouln't know. She may not save anything herself foe childs education. Then blame OP  if it doesn't  cover everything. Worse dayghter might feel entiteled to it and badger child for the money when she gets acess to it.", "People here would tell you to stop buying her even the things on the list, if i had to guess. Which to be clear would make sense", "If something isn't asked for, I wouldn't bother buying extras despite how nice the gesture may be. Having too much stuff for a child can be overwhelming, especially when they grow so quickly and barely get any use out of things like clothing before it doesn't fit anymore.", "I mean she is OKing it - she hasn't asked you to stop. She's seeing your extra gifts as a cash cow for herself.", "She also continues to do it after being told not too. I get the impression the daughter is probably tired of arguing about it.\n\nOP's post has 2 or 3 comments where it sounds like \"I know better than my daughter.\" This is literally a problem of her own making because she hasn't listened.", "Yes I agree she told me she sold it as had too much stuff but she bought double the amount of stuff from the money she made", "I'd ponder if you would give pushback if she said no to everything or would say no to gifting cash. If so, this may be her path to least resistance so it doesn't turn into Talkie Toaster conversation.", "Yeah, sure, that\u2019s easy to do once or twice. And this is not once or twice. Clearly OP continues to give unwanted gifts and it\u2019s become a burden on her daughter.", "Maybe so. But it is her home and baby, so ultimately her decision what clutter to have. It is a bit different when the kid is bigger, and you give them gifts. Even then don't overdo it, it never goes down well.", "But it's clutter that she wants and will use.", "I would stop buying things altogether since she doesn\u2019t seem to be grateful for them. The idea of the bank account is best, if you feel like you are going to get something, pop the money in a bank account and they\u2019ll have a nice sum in a few years. Don\u2019t tell your daughter about it though.", "You're welcome! I'm sure those people will truly appreciate the nice things you bought! \n\nIf you want to see the impact directly, there's a chance you might have nearby charities that would match you with a family. I met an older lady years ago at the store that had no living children and was matched in some sort of adopt a grandchild type program through a charity. Her \"granddaughter\" had gotten pregnant as a teenager and so the older lady was helping her get supplies together. My daughter had recently grown out of her baby stuff so I happily gave her my number and made up a diaper bag of goodies that new parents don't think to buy until it's too late and now they have to go to the store at midnight. \n\nIt wasn't expensive, I had a new diaper bag I'd never used and I stocked it with brand new packs of stuff like puppy pads (best changing mats ever for newborns likely to just pee everywhere the second you get their diaper off), good diaper cream, baby Tylenol, an under arm thermometer, one of those kits with the baby nail clippers, gum brush, hair brush, and nail file, then a variety of pacifiers, these cool teether things you put cold fruit in so it won't choke the baby, and some other stuff I forgot since it's been forever. \n\nWhen she came to pick it up I included a package of diapers and wipes, some protein and granola bars, and some really nice tasting meal replacement shakes since I know that that newborn period can be crazy and mom might not have the energy to even make a sandwich some days.", "Have you got any women\u2019s shelters near you? A lot of people there have kids or babies and came to the shelter with just the clothes on their backs. They always need donations.", "Excited about buying/picking out baby stuff.", "Yes, exactly! If you buy the things she says she wants, she'll use them.  If you buy the things she says she doesn't want, she won't use them.  \n\nImagine this: You put, oh, just thinking of my own grandma, knitting needles and blue yarn on your wish list.  She gets you crochet hooks and beige crochet string.\n\nYou don't crochet, you don't have any projects that will use beige string.  You point this out, and she says 'Come on, mom, it can't all be knitting!'", "I wish she did aswell plus then I could have donated all the bits to charity as someone else suggested. I'm going to stick to the list not buy extras and the things I've bought already for Christmas that I now know will be sold I will donate to a mother and baby shelter \ud83d\ude0a", "This^ or at least understate what it is and say it's some treasury bonds or something not a college fund. So they don't have expectations of school being financed.", "OTOH, OP is setting herself up for 17 years of misery, as her daughter complains about her being cheap and no longer buying anything for her grandchild.", "Stop buying her stuff she doesn\u2019t want. Problem solved.", "Is she buying future sizes?", "Then less is probably a good answer too aside from a savings account for your grandson.", "Then her daughter needs to have that conversation with her instead of leaving her to wonder if it\u2019s too much and ask the internet if she\u2019s an asshole. Cause she\u2019s not. She wants to spoil her grand baby. Nothing wrong with that unless it\u2019s a personal preference.", "I've learnt my lesson now and it will certainly save me money", "You do realize Christmas isn't for another 6 months and what you buy now may not work for him when he gets it?", "She literally has. She has told her mom what she doesn\u2019t like about what OP keeps buying and OP won\u2019t. stop.", "It sounds like the daughter tried to when she made the comment that OP buys for quantity and not quality but that OP is not understanding what is being told to her. The daughter has even sent wish lists of what they want and need, but OP buys that *and other stuff.*\n\nYes, the grandchild may not directly care about any individual piece, but it seems that OP buys a LOT of stuff at any occasion she can. And that's way too much for a single child that will be growing rapidly. It makes sense for the parents to put limits on it to try to control the hoard. The fact that there isn't a million Bluey or Paddington items is the point and a way to be \"well, if grandma won't stop buying things even after I've tried to talk to her, maybe I can at least direct it.\" OP's daughter is also trying to curb this by selling it as a clear message that they don't want all this extra stuff in their house and they WILL get rid of it and not just keep it out of obligation. \n\nI get it that OP is excited. She seems like she may show her love via gifts. But part of gift giving is knowing what is actually needed or wanted. Maybe OP just likes shopping for any cute baby stuff and gets it with her grandson as an excuse. But the parents literally have no room for everything and have tired to get her to stop. I'm glad OP seems to be receptive to the bank account idea as that is a much better solution for everyone involved.", "She would have a fit if I only bought one thing but that would actually be quite funny to see lol \ud83e\udd23"]}
