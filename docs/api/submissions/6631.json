But whatever amount that is, she has to realise that that is money she is going to be without every month until the PS5 is paid off. Reality is, if she can't afford food or transport etc, she can't afford a PS5.", "NTA - but I would reflect on how you loaning her money in the past, not getting repaid, and then loaning her more has enabled her behaviour. As a general rule I never loan money out to family and expect it back, unfortunately it just leads to major conflict and it\u2019s not worth it. Sit her down and discuss an amount that she can pay back weekly/fortnightly/monthly that\u2019s in her budget.

Good luck, such a tough situation!", "NTA at all. You are being way more sympathetic than most. I appreciate what you say about luxuries, but that absolutely does not change the fact that her priority should be starting to pay you back first. If this were a loan from a bank or something, she'd have no choice but to start paying or face some consequences.

That was something I did with my parents when I had to pay them back without becoming completely broke again myself", "NTA- I get that even when you're struggling, you deserve some good things, and those cost money, but it is fair to be upset about it when you see that someone who owes you quite a lot of money spends it on things that are objectively not necessary instead of trying to pay you back.

You've demonstrated that for years - all she had to do was ask. \n\nLike you said, we all deserve enjoyment. But we also all have the responsibility to pay our debts. She isn't lacking enjoyment by repaying you. *She* decides how to spend the money in her hands, regardless of where it came from. *She* made the decisions. *She* is responsible for reconciling her debt.", "NTA  I agree with you that even when you have very little money, some of it needs to be spent on luxuries, because you gotta have something in life to enjoy. However, she could have kept using the PS4, there was no need to spend money on a PS5. \n\nDefinitely no more loans for her from now on. Maybe you can discuss a payment plan with her or something. I don't think she'll be able to pay you back completely, but she could at least attempt to pay some of it back.", "NTA for starting the conversation about the money she owes. YWBTA if you didn't stop this enabling of loaning her money. So got in the habit it's the easy way out. You parents were the enablers and you followed suit. So you're not to blame. Yet.\n\nYou all parents + kids should have the conversation about spending money for needs and saving for wants. Seems long overdue.\n\nShe's doing it the other way around and than emotionally manipulating your parents/you/the next person. She's good at that, but it isn't healthy behaviour for her relationships now or in the future.", "NTA\n\nGiven the explanation, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if money was requested just for the monthly payment. Asking to start getting paid back shouldn\u2019t come as much of a shock since there\u2019s already been so much money loaned.", "NTA\n\nBut stop \"loaning\" her money.

She will continue to ask for \"loans\" but consider them as gifts for as long as you allow it.\n\nMy hard rule is to never loan money to friends and family that I actually need to get back.  In other words, it is a gift and if they ever \"gift it back\" then that is a bonus.\n\nI would suggest a demonstration rather than a lecture:    Ask her to return your old PS4 to you, along with any games she may have of yours.  When she asks why, tell her you need some money so since she doesn't need it anymore you'd like to sell it. If that doesn't make her feel the least bit of guilt for buying a PS5 whilst owing you thousands, then you're probably out of luck.", "NTA\n\nYour parents have (wisely) put a stop to her requests and so should you. With a full-time job she can support herself, you're not doing her any favors by not forcing her to learn to live within her means.", "NTA.

My splurging on \u201cluxuries\u201d was getting McDonald\u2019s once a month, not buying a PS5. Years of scrimping and getting better jobs/promotions has now put my family in a place where we can afford luxuries and have the ability to help others.

She's living well outside her means and buying another thing on debt is a really bad idea. Bit she's ADDICTED TO DEBT. Don't enable her with any more loans. It's a shit way to live for her and you.", "NTA. \n\nYes, she's allowed to splurge once in a while and have something nice. But this is exponentially more than she can either afford or deserve. \n\n1) no more money going out to her. 2) call in her loan. She can now officially afford to start paying you back. If she refuses, chalk it up to a horribly expensive life lesson and say goodbye to this selfish/irresponsible drain on your life.", "NTA. She does need to pay you back and it should be a priority. Also, just stop giving her money.", "NTA - Skip the conversation and the write off the previously loaned money - you are never going to see it back. But STOP lending her money. Just say no. She is a grown woman with a full time job. She needs to figure out how to manage her life and finances. If she gets pushy, tell her \"I am not in a position to lend you any more money.\"  \n\n$7k over 5 years is not a small amount of money.

That said, it\u2019s time to pay whats owed.\n\nA recommendation: keep a ledger, or even a piece of paper with payback transactions so you both see what she has left to pay. Get both of yours\u2019 initials on it too after every transaction.

That is to say in theory, if a consumer keeps borrowing but never repays, those debts will appear on their credit score and in their DTI ratio, and eventually no one will be willing to offer them any more credit. (I know this is very loose and basic and skipping over a lot of stuff, but work with me). \n\nBUT \"buy now, pay later\" companies don't perform underwriting. No one is tracking how much debt a consumer already has when they buy a $500 PS5 for $20 and a promise to pay $20/month until it's fully paid off. I'm sure you can imagine how easy it is for someone to get into a MOUNTAIN of debt by taking on seemingly small \"buy now, pay later\" payments to buy things they could not ordinarily afford, not realizing how quickly those 'small' payments add up.\n\nFrom what you've said about your sister, it doesn't seem far fetched to imagine her in this scenario. \n\nIf you don't put your foot down now, in a few months she's going to start asking you for money again but this time to pay off the debt she's built up.", "Homie, if she can't afford to live on her own, she can gets some damn roommates, like everyone else.

Literally everything. Maybe she can cancel some, maybe some need to stay. It\u2019s easier to work that out when you can see it all listed. That all needs subtracting from her monthly income.\n\nShe then needs to allow herself a monthly amount to live on - say she can get away with spending \u00a360 a week on food as a single person and \u00a340 a month on travel, call it \u00a3300 a month. Maybe an extra \u00a350-100 so she can buy one pair of jeans or have one meal out with friends or whatever a month (depending on whether she does have debt and exactly how much is piling up). Basically whatever is a fair amount based on her income and outgoings/debt, without allowing her to spend unlimited amounts on clothes or games or whatever extra shit she would normally buy but can do without.\n\nWith all that subtracted from her monthly pay, she can see what she has left to pay people back or pay off debt. It needs to be used to pay off whatever she has - paying people back, credit card, loans, stuff she\u2019s bought on credit. Prioritise what she\u2019s paying interest on or is nuking her credit score, and see what options you have for other stuff - 0% balance transfers to a new credit card can be a lifesaver if she\u2019s got credit cards accruing interest, for example. She also needs the self control to not keep using those credit cards. I found it helpful to physically put them somewhere hard to get to like the back of a drawer or even on top of a bookshelf - sure I could access them if I really needed them, but it took away that spontaneous spending that\u2019s so easy with cards.\n\nThe main thing is she needs all this in one place (I find a spreadsheet very helpful and easy to make calculations but there are probably apps etc out there) and it finally needs to be out in the open, more to herself than anyone else. She needs to be able to see exactly how much she owes and how she\u2019s gonna pay it off, cos atm she\u2019s probably not even looking at the balance cos she\u2019s scared.\n\nYou will probably never see your money back.

I\u2019m not just broke I am fully poor. Hitting something like rock bottom is absolutely necessary. \n\nNow if she ends up on the streets starving to death? I\u2019d help, but these little loans aren\u2019t helping her avoid that, honestly.", "That is the beauty of a payment plan for something stupid like a game console.  You dont' need to have any money to get further in debt, that is how poor people stay poor.", "It's definitely something you need to work on, cuz you're actually not the difference between her starving and not; her appropriately managing her spending for her needs is. You stepping in is helping her not experience consequences and practice handling her life as an adult", "Or she can give it back to you and you can sell the PS4 and recoup a little bit of your money. And stop loaning her money. NTA", "you're never getting any of this money back OP. She has the nerve to tell you about the PS5 and her ability to do a payment plan on it which means it's not even CROSSING HER MIND she owes you money because she doesn't plan to pay it back. She has been seeing the money as gifts not actual loans.  \nDo not give her a further cent and if you do just accept it's a gift. However, doesn't sound like you are wealthy or even comfortable financially so you really should not give her any more money.", "Same with mine...", "Exactly. OP, you can't keep giving her money and then being upset over how she handles it or that she isn't paying you back. STOP giving her money and the cycle ends.", "And DON\u2019T GIVE HER ANY MORE MONEY"]}
