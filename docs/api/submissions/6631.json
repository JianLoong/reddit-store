But whatever amount that is, she has to realise that that is money she is going to be without every month until the PS5 is paid off. Reality is, if she can't afford food or transport etc, she can't afford a PS5.", "NTA - but I would reflect on how you loaning her money in the past, not getting repaid, and then loaning her more has enabled her behaviour. As a general rule I never loan money out to family and expect it back, unfortunately it just leads to major conflict and it\u2019s not worth it. Sit her down and discuss an amount that she can pay back weekly/fortnightly/monthly that\u2019s in her budget.

Good luck, such a tough situation!", "NTA at all. You are being way more sympathetic than most. I appreciate what you say about luxuries, but that absolutely does not change the fact that her priority should be starting to pay you back first. If this were a loan from a bank or something, she'd have no choice but to start paying or face some consequences.

That was something I did with my parents when I had to pay them back without becoming completely broke again myself", "NTA- I get that even when you're struggling, you deserve some good things, and those cost money, but it is fair to be upset about it when you see that someone who owes you quite a lot of money spends it on things that are objectively not necessary instead of trying to pay you back.

You've demonstrated that for years - all she had to do was ask. \n\nLike you said, we all deserve enjoyment. But we also all have the responsibility to pay our debts. She isn't lacking enjoyment by repaying you. *She* decides how to spend the money in her hands, regardless of where it came from. *She* made the decisions. *She* is responsible for reconciling her debt.", "NTA  I agree with you that even when you have very little money, some of it needs to be spent on luxuries, because you gotta have something in life to enjoy. However, she could have kept using the PS4, there was no need to spend money on a PS5. \n\nDefinitely no more loans for her from now on. Maybe you can discuss a payment plan with her or something. I don't think she'll be able to pay you back completely, but she could at least attempt to pay some of it back.", "NTA for starting the conversation about the money she owes. YWBTA if you didn't stop this enabling of loaning her money. So got in the habit it's the easy way out. You parents were the enablers and you followed suit. So you're not to blame. Yet.\n\nYou all parents + kids should have the conversation about spending money for needs and saving for wants. Seems long overdue.\n\nShe's doing it the other way around and than emotionally manipulating your parents/you/the next person. She's good at that, but it isn't healthy behaviour for her relationships now or in the future.", "NTA\n\nGiven the explanation, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if money was requested just for the monthly payment. Asking to start getting paid back shouldn\u2019t come as much of a shock since there\u2019s already been so much money loaned.", "NTA\n\nBut stop \"loaning\" her money.

She will continue to ask for \"loans\" but consider them as gifts for as long as you allow it.\n\nMy hard rule is to never loan money to friends and family that I actually need to get back.  In other words, it is a gift and if they ever \"gift it back\" then that is a bonus.\n\nI would suggest a demonstration rather than a lecture:    Ask her to return your old PS4 to you, along with any games she may have of yours.  When she asks why, tell her you need some money so since she doesn't need it anymore you'd like to sell it. If that doesn't make her feel the least bit of guilt for buying a PS5 whilst owing you thousands, then you're probably out of luck.", "NTA\n\nYour parents have (wisely) put a stop to her requests and so should you. With a full-time job she can support herself, you're not doing her any favors by not forcing her to learn to live within her means.", "NTA.

My splurging on \u201cluxuries\u201d was getting McDonald\u2019s once a month, not buying a PS5.

She's living well outside her means and buying another thing on debt is a really bad idea. Bit she's ADDICTED TO DEBT. Don't enable her with any more loans. It's a shit way to live for her and you.", "NTA. \n\nYes, she's allowed to splurge once in a while and have something nice. But this is exponentially more than she can either afford or deserve. \n\n1) no more money going out to her. 2) call in her loan. She can now officially afford to start paying you back. If she refuses, chalk it up to a horribly expensive life lesson and say goodbye to this selfish/irresponsible drain on your life.", "NTA. She does need to pay you back and it should be a priority. Also, just stop giving her money.", "NTA - Skip the conversation and the write off the previously loaned money - you are never going to see it back. But STOP lending her money. Just say no. She is a grown woman with a full time job. She needs to figure out how to manage her life and finances. If she gets pushy, tell her \"I am not in a position to lend you any more money.\"  \n\n$7k over 5 years is not a small amount of money.

That said, it\u2019s time to pay whats owed.\n\nA recommendation: keep a ledger, or even a piece of paper with payback transactions so you both see what she has left to pay. Get both of yours\u2019 initials on it too after every transaction.

Tell her you need her to pay X amount every paycheck, and NEVER loan her money again.", "This honestly isn't a bad idea to bring to the conversation!", "Yeah what I do is when someone asks to borrow a little bit I'll do it. And wether or not they return it in a timely manner without me having to hunt them down determines if I lend it again. \n\nMy mom always said to consider any loans a gift and if you can't afford to gift it, you can't afford to loan it.", "> it becomes a lot harder to turn somebody down when they claim you're the difference between them starving or not.\n\nHelp her find a local food bank or such instead of giving money.", "Tell her to sell things she doesn't need and to start a budget plan for each month as your not able to be her personal atm indefinitely", "Yea she knows how to manipulate you. My boyfriend's brother does this. Spends all his pay checks on bs and doesn't have any money left then calls us because now him, his gf, and their baby can't eat. Our response now is that's tough you should probably manage your money better. \n\nYou can't spend all your money on shit you want then expect someone else to spend their money on the shit you need.", "She's working now though, so surely she can't still claim she's going to starve?", "You need to learn to say no firmly. If she\u2019s hungry and truly has no food, she can go to the food bank or free pantries around town. And if finances are tight, she should take another part time job and reduce her spending. She needs to learn that there is a consequence to her spending. I would let her know now that you don\u2019t plan to loan more so she can plan ahead with her budget.", "If she says that, now you can just tell her to sell the PS5.", "Then get a professional therapist so that you can learn that you are harming her and not helping her.\n\nWhen I was broke, I got 2 extra jobs.  I worked a full time M-F day job, a night time waitress job 3-4 nights a week and a part time weekend job at a retail store.  There is no excuse for her being broke all the time, other than poor money management...and having the habit of making you feel guilty, when not having a few meals may make her wise up.  There are food pantries and other free food options she should be exposed to the hard way.\n\nSTOP GIVING HER ANY MORE MONEY!!", "Your sister could be using a food bank and public transportation to help keep costs down. It\u2019s not always the most convenient thing to do but if she doesn\u2019t have kids to be home for, is capable of working full time and living alone, and consistently prioritizes her *wants over needs* then she is lying.\n\nShe is not at risk of starving. She\u2019s at risk of facing the consequences of her behavior. I\u2019d write off the 7k and take a hard line against any loans. Tell her upfront that you are no longer in a position to help her and that as a gesture of love you\u2019re considering the past loans a gift. Tell her you appreciate her respecting your situation and not expecting or requesting assistance in the future as you will have to say no.\nI", "Sometimes you have to let them starve. She\u2019s 30yo, and keeps letting this happen again and again? She will never change until she\u2019s forced to. She\u2019s never truly worried about hitting rock bottom because she knows there\u2019s a comfy punching bag waiting to break her fall. Let her eat dirt", "\u2026which is exactly why I think OP is an asshole to herself.", "This is EXACTLY  the route I had to take with an older brother that was asking for money regularly from me and our mother. \n\nWhen I finally put my foot down and said we would go buy food for him, go purchase clothes directly for him, or make checks out for his electricity or water bills made payable to the company he got very angry but stopped asking\u2026\nProblem solved.", "Why deli meat? That\u2019s expensive. When I\u2019ve been broke, it\u2019s rice & beans or bread & peanut butter. Something repetitive and boring like that is good motivation to plan better to have money for food next paycheck", "Your parents have said they are fed up with giving her money - you need to do the same. It's clear she's A. Awful with money and B. Has no intention of paying you back soon (if ever). \n\nYou're not helping yourself or her by continuing the pattern. You could offer to help pay groceries but I'd suggest doing a couple of things first instead. \n\n1. Ask her to create a budget (and maybe find a service to help her)\n\n2. Start a monthly payment plan - if she's got steady work there's no reason why she can't start to pay you back, even minimally so she can get used to the idea you're not an open cheque book. She's already doing it for this PS5. \n\n3. Ask her to see a financial advisor (ex through her bank) to look at pulling money into a savings she can't easily access. It sounds like she's an impulsive spender - the best way to combat that it to make the excess money not accessible (ex. It goes into an account she has to request access to).\n\nTELL HER YOU WONT GIVE HER A CENT OR ANY OTHER HELP UNTIL SHE DOES THE ABOVE. Don't offer to help until she starts trying to help herself. Dead serious on this. STOP.\n\nIf you really want to have any chance of getting your money back you'll probably have to help her with these steps and keep on her."]}
