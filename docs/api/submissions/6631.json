By buying a PS5 she has shown you that you will likely never see your money again unless you take her to your countries equivalent of small claims court, etc. \n\nRegardless of what you decide to do, stop lending her money.", "NTA - The danger of a pay monthly plan is that she might not be able to afford it at all, and saw something she could afford. But whatever amount that is, she has to realise that that is money she is going to be without every month until the PS5 is paid off. Reality is, if she can't afford food or transport etc, she can't afford a PS5.", "NTA - but I would reflect on how you loaning her money in the past, not getting repaid, and then loaning her more has enabled her behaviour. As a general rule I never loan money out to family and expect it back, unfortunately it just leads to major conflict and it\u2019s not worth it. Sit her down and discuss an amount that she can pay back weekly/fortnightly/monthly that\u2019s in her budget. Hopefully you can start the conversation gently with \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019ve found full time work and are back on your feet, I\u2019d like to discuss a repayment schedule on the amount owning\u201d. Good luck, such a tough situation!", "NTA at all. You are being way more sympathetic than most. I appreciate what you say about luxuries, but that absolutely does not change the fact that her priority should be starting to pay you back first. If this were a loan from a bank or something, she'd have no choice but to start paying or face some consequences. She's treating you, her sister, worse than she would treat something faceless like a bank. Having your old PS4 and games should be more than sufficient as a luxury anyways.", "ESH but it's a VERY VERY nuanced Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nStop. Enabling. Your. Sister.\n\nYou are allowing her to clearly continue making REALLY incredibly stupid and irresponsible decisions, and thus enabling her misuse of your money.\n\nYou have to stop.\n\nShe has to learn.\n\n(no you would not be more of an asshole for saying something, in fact, you're getting partial asshole credit for not having said something sooner.  She's a grown up, she needs to act like it. )", "NTA\n\nSounds like things are moving up for her, and that\u2019s a good thing, but she needs to pay you back the money you owe her. I would definitley have a conversation about it saying you\u2019re happy but you won\u2019t be giving her anymore money until you are repaid.\n\nIt could be something like a small monthly transfer, ending when you get all the money she owes you. That was something I did with my parents when I had to pay them back without becoming completely broke again myself", "NTA- I get that even when you're struggling, you deserve some good things, and those cost money, but it is fair to be upset about it when you see that someone who owes you quite a lot of money spends it on things that are objectively not necessary instead of trying to pay you back. And it deserves to be acknowledged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a separate note- I've been there OP. Since I've been let down repeatedly I've implemented a \"no double loan\" rule- you owe me? You can't get more until you repay me. Highly recommend it!", "NTA.\n\nIf she can afford a console, she can afford to pay you back. She owes you the money and should prioritize clearing out her debt, anything else is an AH move and selfish.", "NTA. Mary is lacking some major financial skills. Her spending is obviously out of control. \n\nI would probably start by cutting off the supply. If you continue to give her money - she will continue to request it. You've demonstrated that for years - all she had to do was ask. \n\nLike you said, we all deserve enjoyment. But we also all have the responsibility to pay our debts. She isn't lacking enjoyment by repaying you. *She* decides how to spend the money in her hands, regardless of where it came from. *She* made the decisions. *She* is responsible for reconciling her debt.", "NTA  I agree with you that even when you have very little money, some of it needs to be spent on luxuries, because you gotta have something in life to enjoy. However, she could have kept using the PS4, there was no need to spend money on a PS5. \n\nDefinitely no more loans for her from now on. Maybe you can discuss a payment plan with her or something. I don't think she'll be able to pay you back completely, but she could at least attempt to pay some of it back.", "NTA for starting the conversation about the money she owes. YWBTA if you didn't stop this enabling of loaning her money. So got in the habit it's the easy way out. You parents were the enablers and you followed suit. So you're not to blame. Yet.\n\nYou all parents + kids should have the conversation about spending money for needs and saving for wants. Seems long overdue.\n\nShe's doing it the other way around and than emotionally manipulating your parents/you/the next person. She's good at that, but it isn't healthy behaviour for her relationships now or in the future.", "NTA\n\nGiven the explanation, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if money was requested just for the monthly payment. Asking to start getting paid back shouldn\u2019t come as much of a shock since there\u2019s already been so much money loaned.", "NTA\n\nBut stop \"loaning\" her money. Your parents were smart, they stopped.\n\nShe needs to learn how to live within her means.", "NTA.\n\nIf she can afford a pay plan for a PS5 she can afford to pay you back \u00a350 a month.  But I'm sure she will find a reason not to, or to borrow it back immediately. She will continue to ask for \"loans\" but consider them as gifts for as long as you allow it.\n\nMy hard rule is to never loan money to friends and family that I actually need to get back.  In other words, it is a gift and if they ever \"gift it back\" then that is a bonus.\n\nI would suggest a demonstration rather than a lecture:    Ask her to return your old PS4 to you, along with any games she may have of yours.  When she asks why, tell her you need some money so since she doesn't need it anymore you'd like to sell it. If that doesn't make her feel the least bit of guilt for buying a PS5 whilst owing you thousands, then you're probably out of luck.", "NTA\n\nYour parents have (wisely) put a stop to her requests and so should you. With a full-time job she can support herself, you're not doing her any favors by not forcing her to learn to live within her means.", "NTA. If she can't afford to pay back part of her loans, she can't afford luxuries like PS5. The whole \"poor people also deserve luxuries\" applies when the said person doesn't owe a ton of debt to friends and family", "I\u2019ve been poor, living paycheck to paycheck. My splurging on \u201cluxuries\u201d was getting McDonald\u2019s once a month, not buying a PS5. Years of scrimping and getting better jobs/promotions has now put my family in a place where we can afford luxuries and have the ability to help others. We help family and friends who are working at bettering their situations despite setbacks.\n\nYour sister is taking advantage of you. Stop giving her money now. You can try to set up a payment plan, but realistically you are never getting that 7,000 pounds back. Just consider it a gift. NTA.", "NTA!", "NTA\n\nBut you have to realise you aren't gonna get that money back.\n\nYour parents set a boundary after being tired of her free-loading and you filled the bank-of-mum-and-dad gap (it seems naively).\n\nAnd while you're right, sure, people deserve to have fun etc. I don't think everyone is owed luxuries. She's living well outside her means and buying another thing on debt is a really bad idea. Bit she's ADDICTED TO DEBT. Don't enable her with any more loans. It's a shit way to live for her and you.", "NTA. \n\nYes, she's allowed to splurge once in a while and have something nice. But this is exponentially more than she can either afford or deserve. \n\n1) no more money going out to her. 2) call in her loan. She can now officially afford to start paying you back. If she refuses, chalk it up to a horribly expensive life lesson and say goodbye to this selfish/irresponsible drain on your life.", "NTA. She does need to pay you back and it should be a priority. Also, just stop giving her money.", "NTA - Skip the conversation and the write off the previously loaned money - you are never going to see it back. But STOP lending her money. Just say no. She is a grown woman with a full time job. She needs to figure out how to manage her life and finances. If she gets pushy, tell her \"I am not in a position to lend you any more money.\"  \n\n$7k over 5 years is not a small amount of money. Think of what you could have done if you had been saving or investing that money instead of giving it to your sister.", "NTA she could have also spent a bit of money on herself but not 500$", "NTA - it\u2019s great she got a PS5 and welcome to the current gen family! That said, it\u2019s time to pay whats owed.\n\nA recommendation: keep a ledger, or even a piece of paper with payback transactions so you both see what she has left to pay. Get both of yours\u2019 initials on it too after every transaction.
