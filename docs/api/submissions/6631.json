But whatever amount that is, she has to realise that that is money she is going to be without every month until the PS5 is paid off. Reality is, if she can't afford food or transport etc, she can't afford a PS5.", "NTA - but I would reflect on how you loaning her money in the past, not getting repaid, and then loaning her more has enabled her behaviour. As a general rule I never loan money out to family and expect it back, unfortunately it just leads to major conflict and it\u2019s not worth it. Sit her down and discuss an amount that she can pay back weekly/fortnightly/monthly that\u2019s in her budget.

Good luck, such a tough situation!", "NTA at all. You are being way more sympathetic than most. I appreciate what you say about luxuries, but that absolutely does not change the fact that her priority should be starting to pay you back first. If this were a loan from a bank or something, she'd have no choice but to start paying or face some consequences. She's treating you, her sister, worse than she would treat something faceless like a bank.

I would definitley have a conversation about it saying you\u2019re happy but you won\u2019t be giving her anymore money until you are repaid.\n\nIt could be something like a small monthly transfer, ending when you get all the money she owes you. That was something I did with my parents when I had to pay them back without becoming completely broke again myself", "NTA- I get that even when you're struggling, you deserve some good things, and those cost money, but it is fair to be upset about it when you see that someone who owes you quite a lot of money spends it on things that are objectively not necessary instead of trying to pay you back. And it deserves to be acknowledged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a separate note- I've been there OP. Since I've been let down repeatedly I've implemented a \"no double loan\" rule- you owe me?

You've demonstrated that for years - all she had to do was ask. \n\nLike you said, we all deserve enjoyment. But we also all have the responsibility to pay our debts. She isn't lacking enjoyment by repaying you. *She* decides how to spend the money in her hands, regardless of where it came from. *She* made the decisions. *She* is responsible for reconciling her debt.", "NTA  I agree with you that even when you have very little money, some of it needs to be spent on luxuries, because you gotta have something in life to enjoy. However, she could have kept using the PS4, there was no need to spend money on a PS5. \n\nDefinitely no more loans for her from now on. Maybe you can discuss a payment plan with her or something. I don't think she'll be able to pay you back completely, but she could at least attempt to pay some of it back.", "NTA for starting the conversation about the money she owes. YWBTA if you didn't stop this enabling of loaning her money. So got in the habit it's the easy way out. You parents were the enablers and you followed suit. So you're not to blame. Yet.\n\nYou all parents + kids should have the conversation about spending money for needs and saving for wants. Seems long overdue.\n\nShe's doing it the other way around and than emotionally manipulating your parents/you/the next person. She's good at that, but it isn't healthy behaviour for her relationships now or in the future.", "NTA\n\nGiven the explanation, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if money was requested just for the monthly payment. Asking to start getting paid back shouldn\u2019t come as much of a shock since there\u2019s already been so much money loaned.", "NTA\n\nBut stop \"loaning\" her money.

But I'm sure she will find a reason not to, or to borrow it back immediately. She will continue to ask for \"loans\" but consider them as gifts for as long as you allow it.\n\nMy hard rule is to never loan money to friends and family that I actually need to get back.  In other words, it is a gift and if they ever \"gift it back\" then that is a bonus.\n\nI would suggest a demonstration rather than a lecture:    Ask her to return your old PS4 to you, along with any games she may have of yours.  When she asks why, tell her you need some money so since she doesn't need it anymore you'd like to sell it. If that doesn't make her feel the least bit of guilt for buying a PS5 whilst owing you thousands, then you're probably out of luck.", "NTA\n\nYour parents have (wisely) put a stop to her requests and so should you. With a full-time job she can support herself, you're not doing her any favors by not forcing her to learn to live within her means.", "NTA.

My splurging on \u201cluxuries\u201d was getting McDonald\u2019s once a month, not buying a PS5. Years of scrimping and getting better jobs/promotions has now put my family in a place where we can afford luxuries and have the ability to help others. We help family and friends who are working at bettering their situations despite setbacks.\n\nYour sister is taking advantage of you. Stop giving her money now.

She's living well outside her means and buying another thing on debt is a really bad idea. Bit she's ADDICTED TO DEBT. Don't enable her with any more loans. It's a shit way to live for her and you.", "NTA. \n\nYes, she's allowed to splurge once in a while and have something nice. But this is exponentially more than she can either afford or deserve. \n\n1) no more money going out to her. 2) call in her loan. She can now officially afford to start paying you back. If she refuses, chalk it up to a horribly expensive life lesson and say goodbye to this selfish/irresponsible drain on your life.", "NTA. She does need to pay you back and it should be a priority. Also, just stop giving her money.", "NTA - Skip the conversation and the write off the previously loaned money - you are never going to see it back. But STOP lending her money. Just say no. She is a grown woman with a full time job. She needs to figure out how to manage her life and finances. If she gets pushy, tell her \"I am not in a position to lend you any more money.\"  \n\n$7k over 5 years is not a small amount of money.

That said, it\u2019s time to pay whats owed.\n\nA recommendation: keep a ledger, or even a piece of paper with payback transactions so you both see what she has left to pay. Get both of yours\u2019 initials on it too after every transaction.
