It\u2019s creepy and self centred and you do right to avoid him.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, not the A as a matter of principle, i.e. you are never obliged to be in any kind of romantic/sexual relationship that you do not want, regardless of how the other person might feel about it, so by definition you cannot be the AH.  \n\nSecondly, this guy specifically has a weird vibe - the early confession of love is one thing and can maybe be put down to sheer enthusiasm, but the \u201cI\u2019d be so sad if you left\u201d thing smacks of desperation at best, deliberately manipulative behaviour at worst.  Either way it feels like you made the right call.", "NTA for that. You ran from a love Unabomber. But I\u2019d stop letting guys see you naked after they\u2019ve raised the red flags.", "NTA. The most charitable read is the guy is emotionally immature and overwhelmed by (likely new) feelings. It wouldn't be a healthy relationship for him either. He needs to have his heart broken and grow a bit for his own sake as much as yours. \n\nThe less charitable reading is he's particularly unbalanced or a creep. Love bombing early in a relationship can just be childish, but it can also be the prelude to abuse. I don't like to make that assumption, but it's a very real possibility.\n\nI had a relationship with someone who came on very strong, very early. Unlike you, I said it back. We both meant it with the best of intentions. It was a result of us both being in very bad places mentally. We were both knew this at the time, and both were self-aware enough to know it was a bad sign but pursued it anyway. Results were predictable.\n\nThis I think was the best case. If one of us hadn't meant it but had continued either out of guilt or otherwise it would have been so much more crushing later. If I had been the one who said it first I would have preferred a no, at least in the long run, and I think my ex would have agreed.", "NTA\n\nDon't ever stay with someone out of pity. Or if it doesn't feel right for you. Their feelings are theirs to manage. Don't be cruel but don't stay just to make them not feel bad.", "NTA. You dodged a bullet. Anyway, you don't need to stay with someone because of how 'they' feel.", "NTA", "NTA. The \u201cI love you\u201d after 2 dates is red flag territory. Run, and keep running from this person.", "NTA, he hurt himself. You are not oblicated to love someone you don't really even know. You spent so little time together. He got attached way too fast.", "NTA, easily. That is a really toxic behaviour. More than just two times are needed to create a strong connection, it was just too early and it's not good when people put you under pressure when you still have to really know who they are. So, just leave it behind you and go ahead.", "Just to add. I did like him but after he asked if I wanted to be friends with benefits with him and he also added that he should be able to be with others but I wouldn't be able to do the same.", "NTA. When I was 18 my song was \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you love me \u201c. .  If some guy told me he loved me we were done.
