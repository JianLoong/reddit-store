If you can afford rent, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t move out. You\u2019re an adult after all and it\u2019s bound to happen at some point.", "NTA... I would stay.  But be excited for her journey and participate as much as possible.  It's obviously a big deal. Let her know that wherever she is, will be home to you. Tell her that moving out and starting your own life is only possible because of the way she raised you and the values that she instilled.  Tell her and show her you are happy for her and ask that she be happy for you.  Change is hard, and mixing another in with the move will make things stressful but do everything possible to make it a good thing for you both.", "Tell her you're not going. Before she looks anymore. So she doesn't factor you into her plans.. You need to get an apartment and stay. That's where your life is. That makes the most sense for you. Your mom wants what she wants. You want something different and that's appropriate and fine. NTA", "NTA  \nA 40 min commute twice a day, five days a week is too much to ask.  \nYour mom needs to understand that it would be very hard on you.", "NTA. It\u2019s normal that you want to move out in this moment in your life. If your mothers move wouldn\u2019t be the cause, you\u2019d probably move out sooner or later anyway. Your mother is disappointed that she\u2019s too late to live in het dream house with you, I do understand that as well. But she shouldn\u2019t push you not to move out, it\u2019s a healthy step at your age.", "NTA. You\u2019re at the age where it\u2019s time for you to \u201cspread your wings\u201d.

If you are expecting your mom to pay anything for your own rental in addition to her new home, that\u2019s too much for her.", "NTA - Your mother is free to live her life, but she can\u2019t obligate you to do what she wants.  She\u2019s probably wanted this for years, but she missed the window of opportunity.  You aren\u2019t a child anymore.  You have adult responsibilities, and you are tied to the area around where your school is.", "NTA your mom is still looking at you as a child. You're an adult and ready to move out and she should let you. It's sad she couldn't do all this when you were a child but it is what it is. She should realize the hassle living with her would have on you. Momma's being selfish. I say move out, let her get her dream house and visit often.", "You are at the age of moving out - or of moving out soon. So if indeed being happier as a family is your mother's main motive to buy the house, she is not thinking ahead much. NTA.", "My ex and I ended up parking partially for a reason similar to this. Her mums goal was to own a family house, and she was looking at places in a city that had little_bad public transit and not much external public transit. Her mom wanted my girlfriend and her brother to move with her, and she wanted to do it. \n\nTotally valid ! But I wanted to live with her myself sooner, not wait for several more years.\n\nYou are an adult, and you should do what you need to do. Start to budget for your move, look into apartments and roommates as needed. You've got this OP. NTA", "NAH. There is nothing wrong with her doing this. And you are 19. You don't have to go with her.", "NAH but you might want to consider giving it a try over the summer because you might end up liking it after all. There might be a job close to her new house that you would enjoy, it could pay more because it can be harder to find employees in some rural areas. Also, depending on your school program you might be able to schedule classes just a couple days a week or even do some online sometimes. \nJust a thought, but you aren\u2019t horrible if you move into your own apartment either. I would also recommend that you help her with the move either way because I also had a single mom by my college years and you sound close so you want to maintain that good relationship. \nI\u2019m in the US and some of our colleges that have rural areas within an hour or so have their own bussing systems. I know a lot of people who used the long bus rides 2 or 3 times a week as dedicated study time since moving wasn\u2019t an option financially. I would look at the overall costs of both options and see which is the best overall. The apartment might be the best for you from the sounds of it, but your mom will probably feel a lot better if you can show that you researched the pros and cons of both options.", "NAH. You're an adult now. You don't have to live with your mum anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA, get your own place and pay rent if it bothers you so much. Your mum is using this as an opportunity to get on the property ladder, and it's an admirable goal for her to achieve.", "Well I technically can\u2019t really afford it because I won\u2019t be getting student loans or anything. I\u2019ll just have to juggle studying and working a lot of extra shifts", "That\u2019s great advice. Unfortunately my mum is Arab so that type of healthy communication just won\u2019t work", "Consider the value of the money, time, and energy you will save not having to do that 1.5-2 hour commute every day. There is a real cost to that -- and it's *not* a low cost. \n\nSome years ago, after the apartment I was renting was sold out from under me, I used that as an opportunity to get a place close to my job. The new place was a little more expensive -- but it was within walking distance, and the amount of money I saved on mass transport, gas, and car maintenance made up for it. And I was shocked at how much extra time I had in the evenings! It was still light outside when I got home! I could actually get a lot more of my own stuff done! I could go to social events, and I could work out at the club every day if I wanted! I had so much more time and energy.\n\nThis is *your* time to make your own way. I hope you'll grab it.", "Yeah, I get that. Is there any way you can get the people who you want to live with to tell your mom off the record that they will look after you and make sure that you don't get into any trouble?  I don't want to say chaperone, but that's the idea. My ex mil was a strong woman from the Middle East. The girls definitely had to do things differently than the boys. Even still, staying part of the family was just the norm.  \nHmm... maybe do it gradually? Show her how exhausted you are and that it's messing with your grades because you need more study time. Stay with your friends a week and tell her how much school work you got done.  Then ask to extend your stay, then ask to stay for the school year... It's a tough road for sure, but it's definitely worth the try.", "NTA. Move into a houseshare. it's probably better for you now that you are an adult anyway", "Can you suggest to your mother that if she buys the house now to rent it out for 1 year until you complete your schooling?  (Are you planning to live with after school is done)?", "Did you even read the full post? OP would stay if her mother moved. \n\nAnd for some people, the cost for them of an almost 2 hour commute a day would lead them to make different choices.", "Op is 19. \nShe needs to start thinking about her own independence- which is what she is doing.\n\nAlso, her mom is Arab. Forgive me for not believing keeping an eye on Op is not one of her reasons for the insistence.", "I hadn\u2019t seen anything about nationality. That does make an impact as most Arab parents feel like failures if their children move out prior to getting married. The same attitude is prevalent in South America too, and it\u2019s definitely a cultural mindset. A summer at mom\u2019s new house might be needed to make the finances work through because the costs of moving into an apartment can be high especially if it\u2019s not an existing roommate situation. Appeasing mom with a pro con list might help her accept the apartment move more easily too though. I hope it\u2019s not too difficult a situation for either of them.", "op=NTA\n\nso long as you aren't trying to tell HER she can't move, you absolutely are not the AH.\n\nYou are an adult.  I presume you are not expecting her to pay your bills?", "Don't let her guilt you into agreeing with her decision to move. NTA", "NTA. You're an adult and the move would have a negative impact on your schedule.its not her decision", "NTA\u2026I would ask mom how she thinks you would be happier as a family if you have to travel so much for school and work, that you would hardly ever be home, let alone when you are home, you would be tired and grumpy from all the travel, work and studies that you would be asleep most of the time at home?  Is she really thinking of the family or what she wants? Or just what she envisions?  If she moves, tell her you will not be moving with her.  You will be looking for other accomodations s that more fit your currents needs.", "NTA - time to tell mommy you are an adult. Then adult up and make your decisions for yourself. Mom did her job, time for you to take responsibility for yourself."]}
