To save anyone doing the math: yes, we got together when she was 22 and I was 38; we dated for two months before we eloped.

(I did sign a prenup and she has sole access to her trust fund, FWIW.)\n\n\nHer family is large and there are a lot of cousins. Most of them are a lot older or younger than my wife, except for one, who I\u2019ll call Rachel (25F). Growing up they were also very good friends as much as cousins, and Rachel in particular has had a tough life. Her father frequently cheated on her mother and in turn her mother was withdrawn and distant. Her father was also ~20 years older than her mother, so you might see where this is going.\n\n\nJane\u2019s family has regular gatherings, but Rachel never attends them, so she and I hadn\u2019t actually met until recently when she visited. \n\n\nShe barely acknowledged me at dinner, only really speaking to Jane, who got visibly more annoyed by it as the night went on. I could tell she was conflicted, understandably. I thought maybe it\u2019d be better if I excused myself after dinner to let them catch up alone, but as soon as I tried to leave, Rachel started asking me a bunch of questions. The last three were: \n\n\n\u201cHow old was your last ex before Jane?\u201d A: 35 when we broke up.\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you break up?\u201d A: For the same reason as my previous three exes: I couldn\u2019t get out of my own head and decide what I wanted, and it wasn\u2019t fair to them.\n\n\n\u201cHow many of them did you cheat on?\u201d\n\n\nAt that one Jane interrupted with, \u201cRachel, what the fuck?\u201d \n\n\nR: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know?\u201d\n\n\nJ: \u201cHe didn\u2019t cheat on *any* of them, Christ, I\u2019ve fucking *met* three of the four, they still have friends in common.\u201d \n\n\nR: \u201cMaybe they never found out.\u201d\n\n\nThat was when I guess I\u2019d had enough. \u201cLook, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t like me, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that when you\u2019re a guest in our house you won\u2019t just repeatedly insult me. If you\u2019d like to see Jane without me around, that\u2019s fine too, but right now I think you should probably leave.\u201d\n\n\nIt was obvious how frustrated Jane was with her at that point, so it didn\u2019t surprise me when she agreed.\n\n\nRachel went very quiet. She got up, gathered her things, and left without another word, but she was crying by the time she got to the door.\n\n\nI certainly *felt* like an asshole in that moment. Jane said she had no issue with what I said, but the last time she reached out to Rachel, her reply said she had no interest in talking while Jane was married to \u201cthat asshole.\u201d \n\n\nI know the fracturing of this relationship is hurting Jane, and I definitely feel responsible.

Your response to Rachel's rudeness was approriate and called for. Rachel was being an ass. It's not her responsibility to police other people's relationships, no one asked her. She doesn't know how to conduct herself as a guest. That's her problem, not yours.\n\nRachel is the one making the ultimatum. She owes you both an apology. She prefers to play the victim because she isn't mature enough to admit her mistakes.", " NTA\n\nJust stay out of the way.     Tell your wife you trust her decide when/how/whether to reach out to Rachel.  Rachel seems to be a broken soul who needs some support.", "Absolutely NTA and neither is your wife. Her cousin is a major AH. Given what went on in her family, I can't really blame her much for *thinking* that... but she's *definitely* the AH for *saying* it. FFS, by age 25 most of us have figured out that some thoughts need to stay inside our heads, instead of giving voice to anything and everything.", "NTA. Because not only was Rachel insulting you, she was insulting Jane. She was plainly saying Jane made a mistake in marrying you. Jane saw it, was trying not to make a scene. Rachel can dish it out, but couldn't take it. Maybe she'll learn some manners.", "NTA, and you showed a remarkable amount of grace and restraint towards Rachel.  \n\nNeither you nor Jane have either directly or indirectly done anything to harm Rachel.  \n\nFwiw, I have a feeling - based on nothing other than her background as described by you, her archetype, and what you\u2019ve detailed in your post - that she would have found fault with ANYONE Jane married, regardless of age or any other variable. But because you\u2019re the person Jane married, you\u2019re the one she is attacking.", "NTA for expecting respect in your own home. but as a 24 year old I dated a 39 year old who \u201ccouldn\u2019t make up his mind\u201d about the women in his life who were his own age. Much like you. Gives me the ick. he totally took advantage of my inexperience and women his own age saw right through his bullshit. It\u2019s not surprising Rachel is on high alert out of concern for her cousin. \n\nIn my anecdotal experiences, I have never seen such a large age gap not be a toxic situation. A 24 year old and a 40 year old are on totally different wave lengths. Also not sure what her wealth has to do with anything.", "NTA, she can\u2019t be that bothered if she waited 2 years to meet you.", "NTA. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask that guests not insult you in your own house. Especially when she\u2019s just projecting her insecurities onto you without even knowing you. She needs to grow up and fuck off.", "NTA. Rachel has issues. She projected those issues onto you and Jane, probably to make herself feel somehow superior, like she knew a truth you couldn't understand. Instead, she made herself look like an AH, and didn't like it when she was treated as such.\n\nThe key to this is Jane's reaction. Jane *agreed*. Jane *supported your decision*. She called Rachel out. So whatever you said, you were fine. \n\nIt sucks that Jane is hurt, but that is not your fault. *Rachel* is the one hurting your wife. You're just caught in the crossfire because Rachel refuses to deal with her own issues.", "NTA - She is outright disrespecting your marriage and projecting her own fathers infidelity onto you. She needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nRachel's questioning was COMPLETELY uncalled for, and she was rude. I wouldn't tolerate someone showing up at my house and asking me questions like that. It sounds like Rachel has a lot of very unpleasant pre-existing ideas about you. \n\nBut to be frank. YOU are not responsible. Rachel did, as the kids say, fuck around and she found out. Jane AGREED with you that Rachel was overstepping, and if Rachel would rather cut off Jane than admit she was being rude? Well. That shows what kind of person she is, in my opinion. Rachel seems DETERMINED to make YOU into the issue here- when SHE'S the one who turned up at your house to accuse you of cheating.", "Lol that age gap, gross dude", "YTA for having a 24 year old wife.

She wants to play the role of protective cousin, but you've been married for 2 years and this is the first time she's actually met you?\n  \nPart of me wonders if this is actually about you or if something recently happened in Rachel's life and she is projecting her feelings onto you and your wife's relationship.\n  \nEither way, you're right. She doesn't have to like you, but the least she can do is be polite to you in your house or meet her cousin somewhere else to insult you.", "Firm NTA.  You have the right not to be blatantly attacked in your own home and it sounds like you were gentle enough with her.  She has her own issues, maybe once she has some therapy and perspective she'll be able to apologize to you.", "Lol, yea you\u2019re always going to be the asshole for dating someone that young when you\u2019re 40. I would say date someone your own age but they\u2019re probably too mature for you.", ">should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\nYou should not have answered **any** of those intrusive questions at all. You're 40 years old and you haven't learned yet how to change a topic or shut down an interaction altogether? You said you were giving them privacy to hang out, you should have kept walking.\n\nESH, Everyone Sucks Here. Your age gap is going to be family gossip for probably another decade. Hone your social skills about it or let your wife handle her asshole relatives by herself.", "I think given her background you provided you should have been aware she was going after you when she began asking those questions in that setting and could have reacted more proactively to avoid it from escalating as it did. Questions don\u2019t have to be directly answered, especially in that circumstance, just because they are asked. I think that is something you should work on to help avoid situations from escalating in the future. That said, you didn\u2019t act inappropriately and was well within your rights to remove her from the scene to avoid further escalation at that time while standing up to her rude behavior. Who knows the long term consequences of that evening, and how unfortunate it is, especially for Jane but what\u2019s done is done at this point.", "ESH.  \n\nYou should\u2019ve boogied and let them talk; who knows how it might\u2019ve eased tensions. \n\nJust gonna question the EQ of anyone, let alone the 40-year-old in the room, who\u2019d answer those invasive questions. \n\nIf Jane was more mature, she really should have stopped it. Her house, her cousin. \n\nNobody ever went wrong by letting the spouse who\u2019s actually related to the rude guest order the heave-ho. \n\nNow you\u2019re the creepy old dude *who threw Rachel out for even bringing it up.*", "Nta.

It doesn\u2019t seem that long since I was in my mid 20s, but sadly it has been, and I\u2019m almost a completely different person. That being said, I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s too much of an age difference, and she\u2019s still an adult who obviously said \u201cyes.\u201d  Not my place to judge\u2026 and, more importantly, that\u2019s not what OP is asking for judgement about.\n\nI\u2019d say NTA, but I probably would have handled it differently.  I think I would have said \u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on any of them\u201d and just let it go, but I\u2019m not really great with confrontation.", "NTA.  Rachel certainly is though.

Do you expect people to not bat an eyelid when they know your gross age gap? Rachel has every right to hate you and to try to help her friend wake up. \n\nYour excuse for not dating the women your age also shows how gross this relationship is, did having a young partner who is easier to control help you get into that \"headspace\"?", "Not an asshole.
