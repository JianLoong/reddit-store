I think you're NTA for this particular gift. However, it's hard to say when it actually comes to your girlfriend.\n\nI think your entire first paragraph is kind of an excuse. Sometimes buying gifts sucks, sure. Especially if you don't know a person well and this is for a white elephant or something (but hey, that's what wine baskets were made for). But if you're close with a person, like a girlfriend, and you seriously can't think of something they would enjoy based on how well you know them, then you aren't listening very well. I am under the impression you may have given your girlfriend thoughtless gifts in the past and she's feeling resentful, though deciding to bring it up at a poor time.\n\nThe fact is, we're all constantly talking about what kinds of gifts would be important to us. Obviously, not intentionally. But by listening to your friends, knowing the wants, needs, and likes they talk about, you can easily become a fantastic gift-giver. Just by listening.", "Info: What gifts have you gotten her in the past and how has she reacted to them? Any examples?", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m like you, but I\u2019m thinking probably a little older so I\u2019ve learned how to cope with it a little better. Gift cards really aren\u2019t the way to go and you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve been phoning it in. But you don\u2019t know until you know. Make a list of everything your gf likes or does. Foods, hobbies, activities, studied in school, career, books and movies she likes and the clothes she wears. \n\nSo let\u2019s say she really likes gardening. Google \u201cunusual gifts for gardeners\u201d and the name of your city for ideas. Go to a garden center and ask for what can be planted this season. See if you can get an appointment with her and your local master gardener. Make her a planter out of one of your shoes. Find a botanical garden and plan a picnic. But for goodness sake don\u2019t buy her a gift card for Home Depot.", "YTA, not for the thoughtful gift that you put a lot of effort into for your best friend, but for the lack of effort and thoughtfulness that you've put into your girlfriend's gifts for a little over the past year.\n\nWhen I was 2 months into dating my current boyfriend, he was looking through my sketchbook and asked about a specific drawing of two very detailed and colorful frogs. I explained that I wanted to get a couple of custom ceramic frogs to decorate my fairytale section of my bookshelf since I couldn't find any that I liked. I happened across a shop that could make them, but it was too expensive at the time. Well, my boyfriend snuck my drawing out of my sketchbook and had both of my frogs made for me for Christmas the following month. They are by far my favorite Christmas presents, and I show them to everyone. \n\nNow I'm not saying that you have to get things custom made or spend a lot of money, but you need to pay more attention to specific things that your girlfriend either wants or that catches her attention. That will show her that you payed better attention and bothered to remember something besides the general gift cards for things she likes.", "YTA.

Have a conversation with gf about it where you explain your side and acknowledge how she may be hurt by the gift you gave your friend. You might be able to come up with a solution like her giving you basic ideas and you expanding on them. If gifts are part of her love language, you'll need to work together to meet that need. Also try listening to her and getting her small things she likes or needs more regularly (chocolate, flowers, etc.) or surprising her with a bigger thing when you can (fancy dinner, mini vacation, spa day, etc.).", "NTA for now, maybe an edit will change that if it turns out the girlfriend has been receiving really bad gifts. It's ok to give generic stuff like fancy dinners, gift vouchers - it's not ok to give stuff they clearly have no use for.\n\nYour gift for your friend isn't the sort of thing that can be repeated, it came about because of his book.

Make sure you explain to her that you being able to think of this gift for your friend is not a reflection on your feelings towards her, but a moment of growth with something you struggle with. I see this as you often struggle with thinking of unique thoughtful gifts and was proud of yourself for being able to improve this.

Write it down. When it becomes gift giving time, consult your list. \n\n-Make something, like what you did for your friend. My pandemic project was learning to crochet - I've since given many many little crocheted things as gifts. Even if it isn't some amazing thing, they really appreciate the time and effort more than anything. Play to your strengths. Do you wood work? Draw? Paint? Music? \n\n-Pay attention to her hobbies and her struggles. Find something that would make her life easier, or make her hobbies more enjoyable. \n\n-The best gift is one a person wouldn't buy (or wouldn't think to buy) for themselves, but are happy to have. This is important as you get older and have more disposable income, as people then just buy whatever they need. So stay away from needs and find some wants, especially if they're a little decadent. \n\n-If you're really desperate and your list is empty, you could at least pay attention to what she buys from the makeup store and buy that instead of a gift card.

We also endorse in our favourite snacks, listen to music in the car, have bookshelves, talk about our interests, have expensive cosmetics in the bathroom or wear a certain style of jewellery, just to name a few examples. When a friend constantly asks me to scratch her back I can be sure some handwritten vouchers for scratching her back in her gift will make her smile. My best friend is an artist. I see his work and we talk about styles and media. Therefore I know a sketchbook to keep his pencil practice pieces in one place, an acrylic starter set when I know he's interested in them or aquarelle pencils will suit him. He also always has cold feet so my hand knitted socks are also not a bad idea. He has the perfect gift idea 90% of the time. The other 10% are either me needing something within our budget but not being able to afford it or him being a little unsure and me giving him a long list he can pick and choose from for years. When I absolutely don't know what to do I ask. It's not hard to ask. My mom loves hand knitted socks and needs lots of hand balm. Two things to keep in mind.

It's not even that hard to be thoughtful with Sephora (and make sure to keep receipts for easy exchanges).", "He's continuing to weaponize incompetence by pretending he can't tell why his girlfriend is mad.   \n\n\nHe spent days have books bond and writing original content for his friend, but only gets sephora giftcards for his girlfriend. What a dweeb.", "Yeah I\u2019ve given (what I think, based on reactions) lots of good gifts over the years. Generous and thoughtful, but the ones for my husband have never landed well. I\u2019ve actually given up trying to get him a nice gift, he now just picks what he wants and gets the cash for it in a card.", "And a lot of people have a collection of some sort that makes go-to gifts really attainable.", "I was broke in my early-20s and working on some job prospects. I was hanging out with my best friend and she was asking me how it was going. I mentioned I was a little embarrassed in a recent interview because my nicer \"interview\" clothes were still pretty ratty. While I was embarrassed, it was a 10-second exchange (if that) that I passed off as a joke (I think I said something along the lines of \"maybe it'll help, they'll take pity on me, a poor street urchin, and hire me\").\n\nBut a few days later, she gave me a Ross gift card with a \"World's Best Aunt\" card \"from her daughter.\" It was never my intention to beg for hand-outs but I was so grateful to her.\n\nI try to pay it forward by listening for similar opportunities of giving in my friends' lives.", "Sure, but that doesn't mean that they necessarily want you to buy something related to it. I mean, I'll mention things I like, but it doesn't mean I want someone to buy me something related to it.", "I share interests but\u2026 we have several streaming platforms so probably don\u2019t buy me a DVD. If it\u2019s something not on a platform- I might actually buy it myself. Same with music. I buy a lot of books, I could talk about my favourite author, you\u2019d have to search all my bookcases, my kindle, and audible to be sure I don\u2019t have it. It can be tricky. \nThat said I spent about a decade moaning about the skinny Jean tyranny and my last gift from my partner was flared Jeans when one ship where we live finally stocked them. Wine is also a good one. We have too many animals (unless you meant animal themed which makes more sense. We used to have nine dogs, my perception is warped).", "We've been together for a year and two months.\n\nMake up is a big interest of hers. Other than that, I feel like a lot of gifts based on people's interests (like a t-shirt based on their favorite TV show or what have you) can feel equally as phoned in.", "My husband and I walked by a jewlery store. Something in the window caught my eye and I commented that I really liked it. My husband noted it, went back and got it and saved it for 2 months for a Christmas gift (it wasn't expensive). He Did a similar thing w/ a piece of pottery for Christmas last year (again, the gift was under $50).\n\nI keep a note on my phone of things he mentions he likes/needs or things I see on-line or when shopping that I think would be good gifts.\n\nIf you wait until the last minute and don't pay attention, then yes, gift giving is hard and doesn't have to be that expensive.", "Then sorry my dude YTA absolutely imo.", "Any hobbies that she truly enjoys? And souvenirs that she likes?"]}
