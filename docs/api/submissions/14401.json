I think you're NTA for this particular gift. However, it's hard to say when it actually comes to your girlfriend.\n\nI think your entire first paragraph is kind of an excuse. Sometimes buying gifts sucks, sure. Especially if you don't know a person well and this is for a white elephant or something (but hey, that's what wine baskets were made for). But if you're close with a person, like a girlfriend, and you seriously can't think of something they would enjoy based on how well you know them, then you aren't listening very well. I am under the impression you may have given your girlfriend thoughtless gifts in the past and she's feeling resentful, though deciding to bring it up at a poor time.\n\nThe fact is, we're all constantly talking about what kinds of gifts would be important to us. Obviously, not intentionally. But by listening to your friends, knowing the wants, needs, and likes they talk about, you can easily become a fantastic gift-giver. Just by listening.", "Info: What gifts have you gotten her in the past and how has she reacted to them? Any examples?", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m like you, but I\u2019m thinking probably a little older so I\u2019ve learned how to cope with it a little better. Gift cards really aren\u2019t the way to go and you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve been phoning it in. But you don\u2019t know until you know. Make a list of everything your gf likes or does. Foods, hobbies, activities, studied in school, career, books and movies she likes and the clothes she wears. \n\nSo let\u2019s say she really likes gardening. Google \u201cunusual gifts for gardeners\u201d and the name of your city for ideas. Go to a garden center and ask for what can be planted this season. See if you can get an appointment with her and your local master gardener. Make her a planter out of one of your shoes. Find a botanical garden and plan a picnic. But for goodness sake don\u2019t buy her a gift card for Home Depot.", "YTA, not for the thoughtful gift that you put a lot of effort into for your best friend, but for the lack of effort and thoughtfulness that you've put into your girlfriend's gifts for a little over the past year.\n\nWhen I was 2 months into dating my current boyfriend, he was looking through my sketchbook and asked about a specific drawing of two very detailed and colorful frogs. I explained that I wanted to get a couple of custom ceramic frogs to decorate my fairytale section of my bookshelf since I couldn't find any that I liked. I happened across a shop that could make them, but it was too expensive at the time. Well, my boyfriend snuck my drawing out of my sketchbook and had both of my frogs made for me for Christmas the following month. They are by far my favorite Christmas presents, and I show them to everyone. \n\nNow I'm not saying that you have to get things custom made or spend a lot of money, but you need to pay more attention to specific things that your girlfriend either wants or that catches her attention. That will show her that you payed better attention and bothered to remember something besides the general gift cards for things she likes.", "YTA.

Have a conversation with gf about it where you explain your side and acknowledge how she may be hurt by the gift you gave your friend. You might be able to come up with a solution like her giving you basic ideas and you expanding on them. If gifts are part of her love language, you'll need to work together to meet that need. Also try listening to her and getting her small things she likes or needs more regularly (chocolate, flowers, etc.) or surprising her with a bigger thing when you can (fancy dinner, mini vacation, spa day, etc.).", "NTA for now, maybe an edit will change that if it turns out the girlfriend has been receiving really bad gifts. It's ok to give generic stuff like fancy dinners, gift vouchers - it's not ok to give stuff they clearly have no use for.\n\nYour gift for your friend isn't the sort of thing that can be repeated, it came about because of his book.

Make sure you explain to her that you being able to think of this gift for your friend is not a reflection on your feelings towards her, but a moment of growth with something you struggle with. I see this as you often struggle with thinking of unique thoughtful gifts and was proud of yourself for being able to improve this.

Write it down. When it becomes gift giving time, consult your list. \n\n-Make something, like what you did for your friend. My pandemic project was learning to crochet - I've since given many many little crocheted things as gifts. Even if it isn't some amazing thing, they really appreciate the time and effort more than anything. Play to your strengths. Do you wood work? Draw? Paint? Music? \n\n-Pay attention to her hobbies and her struggles. Find something that would make her life easier, or make her hobbies more enjoyable. \n\n-The best gift is one a person wouldn't buy (or wouldn't think to buy) for themselves, but are happy to have. This is important as you get older and have more disposable income, as people then just buy whatever they need. So stay away from needs and find some wants, especially if they're a little decadent. \n\n-If you're really desperate and your list is empty, you could at least pay attention to what she buys from the makeup store and buy that instead of a gift card.

We also endorse in our favourite snacks, listen to music in the car, have bookshelves, talk about our interests, have expensive cosmetics in the bathroom or wear a certain style of jewellery, just to name a few examples. When a friend constantly asks me to scratch her back I can be sure some handwritten vouchers for scratching her back in her gift will make her smile. My best friend is an artist. I see his work and we talk about styles and media. Therefore I know a sketchbook to keep his pencil practice pieces in one place, an acrylic starter set when I know he's interested in them or aquarelle pencils will suit him. He also always has cold feet so my hand knitted socks are also not a bad idea. He has the perfect gift idea 90% of the time. The other 10% are either me needing something within our budget but not being able to afford it or him being a little unsure and me giving him a long list he can pick and choose from for years. When I absolutely don't know what to do I ask. It's not hard to ask. My mom loves hand knitted socks and needs lots of hand balm. Two things to keep in mind. She also once got a shower product set she really liked. Well here's a third idea, there's something she likes but wouldn't usually buy.\n\nDo you really know not one of the examples mentioned about your friends?", "We do.

He likes Milwaukee tools and he will often say oh I really need one of these. I take a picture of it with its display tag, then when I need to buy a gift I go in home Depot and I show the salesperson my options and they help me pick one. You could do the same thing with makeup, jewelry, clothing anything!\n\n3) go into the Amazon search bar and put \"gifts for girlfriend\" or gifts for chicken lovers, gardeners, readers etc. You don't necessarily have to buy it off of Amazon, but their suggestions are usually very good.\n\nHope that helps!", "NAH. Your gift was wonderfully thoughtful but also a big leap in creativity from a gift card. GF is reasonably hurt that you don't put as much thought into hers. Possibly you think friend's interests are a little more intellectual while hers are merely make up and purses (as per comments). Which is condescending so somewhat AHish But, you sound as if you'd like to do better and you can if you follow these steps: remember that gifts are about receiver interests not giver. Next consider what you did for your friend and do likewise for GF ergo get creative. And makeup is a perfect interest as it's essentially an art media. I can think of 10 not at all phoned in gifts: handmade cosmetic rack, makeup mirror, vintage vanity or cosmetics set, museum specializing in makeup in different cultures, face painting kit, henna tattoo set, theatre makeup set, Opera tickets,backstage pass to theatre makeup dept, professional makeup session, books by celeb makeup artists, antique Maquillage box...or for lower budgets a nice set of brushes, or some colors you think would look good on her.\n \nYou can do this with anyone's interests if you just pay attention and brainstorm a little.

Op is NTA, gf needs to chill.", "I get what you mean but how do you not know what you partner likes and shit like that and hat they don\u2019t have it\u2019s not hard to remember 1 thing they enjoy say my sister likes hello kitty my dad like \u201cbaby yoda\u201d my partner likes legos, my mom like gnomes, my MIL likes fab letics my lil bro like football my other l bro likes art pens, my big bro likes Deadpool my (bitch of a) grandma like turtles my FIL likes survival gear my SFIL likes those desert hats my nephew youngest likes buzz light year my SIL like space my other SIL loves dogs my lil sister in law loves art my youngest SIL loves Renaissance stuff  my XSMIL likes tattoos I could continue for ages but it\u2019s not hard to remember one single thing someone you care for likes", "I usually get soooooo close. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten him something he really wants, but not quite right. It's generally something I can't really have known, but still, I'm so pleased when the gift is right on the first try.", "But you\u2019re still trying and not just giving gift cards, so that\u2019s okay!", "Idk, I give my partner incredibly though-out gifts, and some of them never see use. Like I bought him bedsheet suspenders, bc his sheets pull off when he tosses and turns. \n\nThere's been other gifts like that, but the thing is, at least I tried. At least it came from a real need or interest that he expressed. It's not a fucking gift card, and I'm not putting more thought into friends' gifts than his.", "When you go shopping with him, does he look at stuff he likes? Does he mention a book he wants to read? A movie he wants to watch? I just keep a running list on my phone of things they\u2019ve mentioned.", "Actually it\u2019s not difficult at all. Keep a running note in your phone every time your husband (or whoever else you may need to get a thoughtful gift for) mentions in passing that they want or need something that they wouldn\u2019t buy for themselves, or comes across something at a store that they love but don\u2019t buy. When it comes to gift giving time pick something off the list. This has never failed me.", "Does he have no hobbies or interests? Do you pay zero attention to him? It\u2019s hard to believe being with someone for any length of time and having no clue what they might like. Sorry it\u2019s weird.", "That\u2019s a lot of words to use when a simple, \u201cWow, I was TA because I am too lazy to put effort into my gf but have endless energy to put into my friend\u201d. \n\nYou came for a judgment and got a unanimous one. Do better, your (hopefully soon to be ex) deserves a heck of a lot better than after thought gift cards.", "I know it can be super hard to find a good gift. Sometimes I spend hours brainstorming different things to Google or aspects of what they like. It\u2019s the same method you used for your friend though. Find a hobby or something they\u2019re passionate about, and get something that will be meaningful for that thing / make it easier / add value to it in general. I also try to write down any ideas I get throughout the year in my notes app - this way I can reference the note when needed. Gift cards are nice but well thought out gifts are so much more meaningful.", "Yeah, you are lazy when it comes to your Gf and gifts. She likes makeup, I don't understand makeup, gift cards. Same with purses/shoes....you are demonstrating that you think your Gf is shallow and you can't possibly give her a better gift because you don't have the depth of connection with her you do your friend (and handful of others). You know you are phoning it in with gift cards so you know you are phoning it in with your Gf. Why are you surprised that hurts her feelings?", "Oddly, by contrast, in my family a specific wish list is the norm and what I greatly prefer, so \u2018it\u2019s better to give nothing than to ask\u2019 is not universal.\n\nBut that\u2019s often the issue \u2014 there are multiple gifting styles/cultures, and what looks thoughtful to one person won\u2019t to another.", "The effort one puts in is it exactly!!\n\nOne year for my birthday I got a bag of Halloween kitchen towels. I had been buying more holiday themed ones leading up to that,  to be fair, but it was a bummer. Last year for my birthday I got the souvenirs my husband had brought me back from his golf vacation the month prior. It was a few fridge magnets and some earrings - styles I would not normally wear. They were still in the little plastic wadded up bag from the souvenir shop.\n\nConversely, for Valentine's Day I gave him a card (which he criticized what I wrote) and some candy while I got nothing. \n\nWriting that out now, I'm not sure which is worse- zero effort or crappy gifts but tiny effort?  I guess the tiny effort feels like leaving a penny for a tip...", "Jesus, no wonder she feels neglected. I wouldn't give my little brother a gift card for his birthday, let alone my significant other.", ">Oddly, by contrast, in my family a specific wish list is the norm and what I greatly prefer, so \u2018it\u2019s better to give nothing than to ask\u2019 is not universal.\n\nSame in my family too.\n\nI truly don\u2019t see what is wrong with a list.", "I can totally relate! My husband is so difficult to buy for. Frequently after I bought him a gift, but before giving it to him, he'd buy it himself. I've gotten through to him that he can't do that. \nThis year, after buying something off his wishlist, he still wants it altered in specific, difficult ways. He loves science and space, 9 years ago I got him a telescope that he says was a perfect gift but has still never used... Some people are just hard!", "yeah YTA. She\u2019s correct.", "You can definitely do better with your gift giving, however you\u2019ve only been together a little over a year how many opportunities has there really been for inspiration to hit? Might be a point to say how long you\u2019ve given your bff shit or no presents before you came up with this idea. NAH. Maybe for presents you should think of experiences to do together (concerts, weekend away, coming class, wine tasking?) that are easier than buying items. Then you have a nice memory and not just some spare cash for a stuff you buy yourself regardless.", "Yeah I've got a closet full of really cool shit that I would not have bought and really don't have room for. I'm enough of a packrat without people throwing shinies at me lol\n\nLike all I really need are more t-shirts and pajama pants but I don't talk about that so instead I get chachkies because those make adhd brain go brr at shops", "I\u2019m known as the \u201cthoughtful gift giver\u201d in the family but I can\u2019t really give my husband anything good because 1) if he wants something really he will get it for himself 2) he would rather save the money I would\u2019ve used to get him a gift and 3) if I make him something homemade he just sees it as junk cluttering up the house.\n\nAlso every Christmas for the last four years, when I get him a gift, he will say \u201cI thought we agreed on no gifts! I swear we agreed on that!\u201d And every year I will say, \u201cNo, we never agreed on that, and I know we never agreed on that because I would never in a million years agree to that oh and also this EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED LAST YEAR when will you learn??\u201d And he will have to rush out last minute to get me a gift.\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day though we actually did agree on no gifts and he got me a gift anyway and I was like \u201c?? thank you but why did you give me a gift?\u201d And he was like \u201cYou asked me to\u201d and I was like \u201c\u2026no I didn\u2019t.\u201d", "The vast majority of my boyfriend's wishlist is just 'new sweaters' and my mom always winds up getting the color/fabric he likes better. Same brand as what I got him. Dunno what it is lmao cause I'm the one giving the parents on both sides his list. His mom often gets the wrong size...", "It\u2019s possible. I can come up with some amazingly thoughtful gifts for certain people or occasions but others nope", "Not the person you were responding to. But yes to some of those. He doesn\u2019t have a ton of hobbies (basically just video games and cooking) and if he wants something, 99% of the time he buys it. He\u2019s not into clothes or shoes. He so hard to buy for. There\u2019s just so few things he really wants, so I\u2019m stuck between something really utilitarian or trying to come up with a sentimental gift that won\u2019t just get stuck in a box out of lack of place to put it.\n\nOne of my best friends has a ton of crafty type hobbies, so a wide variety of crafting materials, in a wide range of prices, make good gifts. She has a thing she collects which is easy to find and can be pretty inexpensive. It\u2019s easy to get something personal and  thoughtful (though not necessarily to the extent OP did).", "I'm not the person you replied asking this question to, but I am similar to them. I am great at giving gifts to my close friends, but when it comes to my boyfriend? I suck. I think the reason behind this is we have two completely different personalities as well as interests. He's a car guy, whereas my friends and I share a love for anime for example. So I guess for me my friend's interests are more within my realm of knowledge and comfort, so I tend to know exactly what I'm looking for. \n\nBut I don't drive and I have a hard time even being a passenger in a vehicle. So unless my boyfriend wants an abundance of car fresheners, steering wheel covers, or cool car stickers, I tend to just have him make me a list of things he would like and I pick a couple things off it. This way he's still surprised yet content with what he gets.", "No, some people are just easier to get gifts for than others. It is also hard to get people you feel already have everything or get themselves things they really want.  My BFF? Got a list of things I know she would love. My bf? That needs to be a discussion \ud83d\ude05 parents? They are the single hardest people in my life to get gifts for. \n\nIt doesn't mean we love them any less, it just means we have zero freaking clue what they would appreciate because they usually always get what they want before a gift giving occasion even happens or their interests are so narrow or unknown that it's hard to figure out what is worth getting for them.", "Some people are way harder to find gifts for than others.  That said, your partner is someone you should be spending extra time trying to work out ideas for.  Phoning it in with gift cards is not something a lot of people are going to be happy with.\n\nTo OP: Maybe commission some art on Reddit?  A reproduction of a moment from your relationship, or a portrait of them if they\u2019d be comfortable with that, a pet, or something referencing their hobby?", "Some people are just really hard to buy for. My mom is like this, she has a really specific taste in everything.  Getting something that is a complete surprise that she will actually like is nearly impossible. She knows she is like this, so she just tells us what she wants.  Or just get her socks, they are always a hit.", "Some people are hard to buy gifts for. They don\u2019t like very much.\n\nMy spouse sometimes doesn\u2019t receive gifts very graciously, or is often disappointed in gifts that I\u2019ve put thought and effort into getting. It makes it harder to come up with ideas for gifts.", "Some people are hard to buy gifts for. I think I am, though I'm also not the kind of person to be offended by getting an underwhelming gift. And honestly, if I received the gift that the OP gave to his or her best friend, I'd be touched at the effort and thoughtfulness, but I'd put it in the back of a cupboard and never look at it again.", "About dud gifts- \n\nA few people have given me books that I hated right off. Wrong genre, horrible author, just absolute shit.\n\nOccasionally someone recalls an author I like, or a genre, sees a top review and buys that for me. Except it's a book that usually came out long before the holiday season so I've already bought and read it.\n\nI'm not easy to buy gifts for and it's just better to give up on books at least.", "I don\u2019t think buying a gift card is overthinking. It\u2019s be one thing if OP put a lot of thought into gifts that didn\u2019t land, but they said they mostly get gift cards. That is minimal though, minimal effort.\n\nOP, YTA", "Yes, this. Some people are just fucking hard to gift!!! I've been shopping with my mom a million times, you'd think I know her style, but what she picks isn't what I'd pick. I buy her books on topics she likes and she leaves them in the bag for years. My dad was even worse, if there weren't any new redneck comedy CD's out (he was from Montana), I was sunk, he already had everything he wanted, as most men do.  I asked what they wanted and got \"I dunno\" responses. I'm inclined to say if you don't know what you want, maybe we should just skip getting you something you don't want, but they want some gift anyway! \n\nI think OP got lucky on thinking of a good one, which happens once in awhile.", "I had the perfect idea for a Christmas gift for my dad in October. Discussed with siblings (joint gift).  I was so excited.  It was something my dad hadn\u2019t said he wanted, but I knew he would love.  And so I waited for Black Friday.  10 days before Black Friday my dad wants to show me this cool thing he just bought.   Sigh.  So deflating.  He ruined the one truly thoughtful perfect gift I had ever come up with for him.", "Some people are just more difficult to buy for than others due to not liking to be gifted \"stuff\" or preferentially buying stuff for themselves when they want it. I also say this as a person who struggles across the board with gift giving, though.", "I am a great gift giver. My love language is gifts. But I am self aware enough to know that it is incredibly hard to buy me anything. I never ask for anything. I never mention wanting anything. I rarely \"like\" things. Most of our time is spent working, shuttling children, then relaxing reading, scrolling, or TV. Not a lot of time to see something I like. Also, I grew up extremely poor and taught myself to not want things. My husband has tried for 13 years and has successfully bought me good gifts for like 2 birthdays and one Christmas. But it's ok, I know he's trying.", "He seems relieved that I\u2019ve given up. The pressure is off us both now \ud83d\ude02", "Some people just don't like gifts my dad just tells us not to get anything for Father's day or his birthday because he just goes and buys himself golf balls from us for himself.   But for my folks since they don't want more stuff around the house I order food from. Usingers sausage or cheese places to send.", "I buy things when I have the idea. (If it's 6 months in advance then so be it). Don't know if that helps", "Thanks for saying that! I guess you're right, cookies really are an excellent gift. :-)", "same, but I use their birthday in my calendar. I use birthdays for all kinds of notes. \"Favorite color blue\" \"Cream, no sugar\" \"loves Rammstein\" \"fave soda fresca\" \"boycotting starbucks\" \"vegan - NO HONEY\" \"allergic to chocolate\" \"lactose intolerant but will suffer for taste\"  and of course links to things they mentioned wanting one time so I can buy it next time I have to get them something.", "But would they necessarily want things just because they're related to things they like? Maybe it's just that I'm not that gift-oriented, but I've gotten gifts from coworkers that are related to things I love (fave TV shows or hobbies), and they were nice thoughts, but they just aren't gifts I would have gotten for myself; they're just taking up space in my apartment. But honestly I'm really not someone who likes physical things...and I don't have a lot of space for things.", "My husband and I are the same way, and it doesn't mean we don't love each other. We each buy what we want and don't give each other birthday or Christmas gifts. However, if we find something we know the other will love, we will buy it, just a surprise gift.", "I had to tell my husband there was a ban on buying himself anything 30 days or less prior to a gift-giving holiday. Too many times I had the \u2018perfect idea\u2019 only for him to buy himself the \u2018thing\u2019 right before & I\u2019d have to scramble to come up w a new idea that never felt as good as the first one", "I try to do that, too. Then frantically search my house from top to bottom because I just *knew* I would remember where I hid the gift so my husband and/or kids wouldn\u2019t find it. Recently found a gift I intended to give him for Christmas two years ago\u2026in our attic crawl space because we never go up there unless we are storing something.

People like things related to the things they like. Yes, there is a limit, and have to be appropriate, but yes.\n\nIf they say they like penguins, getting them a penguin  themed gift every birthday is lame, but you could et them tickets if there is a special penguin exhibit comming to the zoo and that would be thoughtful.\nIf they like vintage clothing AND they like the band Toto, then a vintage Toto concert tee is appropriate.\n\nPeople also talk about specific things they like ALL THE TIME. Watching TV, my husband or I will say things like, wow, that is a cool sweater character x is wearing, or things like that. I have a co-worker who started getting into plants over the pandemic and is now starting to feel comfortable with orchids, I could get her an orchid. People say things all the time.", "Ooh, my husband has given me the same ban for the same reason \ud83e\udd23", "OK, I'm just saying I don't see a use for a physical thing related to something I like. I have movies/music/books I love; I just don't need a shirt or one more plastic thing related to it."]}
