I think you're NTA for this particular gift. However, it's hard to say when it actually comes to your girlfriend.\n\nI think your entire first paragraph is kind of an excuse. Sometimes buying gifts sucks, sure. Especially if you don't know a person well and this is for a white elephant or something (but hey, that's what wine baskets were made for). But if you're close with a person, like a girlfriend, and you seriously can't think of something they would enjoy based on how well you know them, then you aren't listening very well. I am under the impression you may have given your girlfriend thoughtless gifts in the past and she's feeling resentful, though deciding to bring it up at a poor time.\n\nThe fact is, we're all constantly talking about what kinds of gifts would be important to us. Obviously, not intentionally. But by listening to your friends, knowing the wants, needs, and likes they talk about, you can easily become a fantastic gift-giver. Just by listening.", "Info: What gifts have you gotten her in the past and how has she reacted to them? Any examples?", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m like you, but I\u2019m thinking probably a little older so I\u2019ve learned how to cope with it a little better. Gift cards really aren\u2019t the way to go and you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve been phoning it in. But you don\u2019t know until you know. Make a list of everything your gf likes or does. Foods, hobbies, activities, studied in school, career, books and movies she likes and the clothes she wears. \n\nSo let\u2019s say she really likes gardening. Google \u201cunusual gifts for gardeners\u201d and the name of your city for ideas. Go to a garden center and ask for what can be planted this season. See if you can get an appointment with her and your local master gardener. Make her a planter out of one of your shoes. Find a botanical garden and plan a picnic. But for goodness sake don\u2019t buy her a gift card for Home Depot.", "YTA, not for the thoughtful gift that you put a lot of effort into for your best friend, but for the lack of effort and thoughtfulness that you've put into your girlfriend's gifts for a little over the past year.\n\nWhen I was 2 months into dating my current boyfriend, he was looking through my sketchbook and asked about a specific drawing of two very detailed and colorful frogs. I explained that I wanted to get a couple of custom ceramic frogs to decorate my fairytale section of my bookshelf since I couldn't find any that I liked. I happened across a shop that could make them, but it was too expensive at the time. Well, my boyfriend snuck my drawing out of my sketchbook and had both of my frogs made for me for Christmas the following month. They are by far my favorite Christmas presents, and I show them to everyone. \n\nNow I'm not saying that you have to get things custom made or spend a lot of money, but you need to pay more attention to specific things that your girlfriend either wants or that catches her attention. That will show her that you payed better attention and bothered to remember something besides the general gift cards for things she likes.", "YTA.

Have a conversation with gf about it where you explain your side and acknowledge how she may be hurt by the gift you gave your friend. You might be able to come up with a solution like her giving you basic ideas and you expanding on them. If gifts are part of her love language, you'll need to work together to meet that need. Also try listening to her and getting her small things she likes or needs more regularly (chocolate, flowers, etc.) or surprising her with a bigger thing when you can (fancy dinner, mini vacation, spa day, etc.).", "NTA for now, maybe an edit will change that if it turns out the girlfriend has been receiving really bad gifts. It's ok to give generic stuff like fancy dinners, gift vouchers - it's not ok to give stuff they clearly have no use for.\n\nYour gift for your friend isn't the sort of thing that can be repeated, it came about because of his book.

Make sure you explain to her that you being able to think of this gift for your friend is not a reflection on your feelings towards her, but a moment of growth with something you struggle with. I see this as you often struggle with thinking of unique thoughtful gifts and was proud of yourself for being able to improve this.

Write it down. When it becomes gift giving time, consult your list. \n\n-Make something, like what you did for your friend. My pandemic project was learning to crochet - I've since given many many little crocheted things as gifts. Even if it isn't some amazing thing, they really appreciate the time and effort more than anything. Play to your strengths. Do you wood work? Draw? Paint? Music? \n\n-Pay attention to her hobbies and her struggles. Find something that would make her life easier, or make her hobbies more enjoyable. \n\n-The best gift is one a person wouldn't buy (or wouldn't think to buy) for themselves, but are happy to have. This is important as you get older and have more disposable income, as people then just buy whatever they need. So stay away from needs and find some wants, especially if they're a little decadent. \n\n-If you're really desperate and your list is empty, you could at least pay attention to what she buys from the makeup store and buy that instead of a gift card.

We also endorse in our favourite snacks, listen to music in the car, have bookshelves, talk about our interests, have expensive cosmetics in the bathroom or wear a certain style of jewellery, just to name a few examples. When a friend constantly asks me to scratch her back I can be sure some handwritten vouchers for scratching her back in her gift will make her smile. My best friend is an artist. I see his work and we talk about styles and media. Therefore I know a sketchbook to keep his pencil practice pieces in one place, an acrylic starter set when I know he's interested in them or aquarelle pencils will suit him. He also always has cold feet so my hand knitted socks are also not a bad idea. He has the perfect gift idea 90% of the time. The other 10% are either me needing something within our budget but not being able to afford it or him being a little unsure and me giving him a long list he can pick and choose from for years. When I absolutely don't know what to do I ask. It's not hard to ask. My mom loves hand knitted socks and needs lots of hand balm. Two things to keep in mind. She also once got a shower product set she really liked.

I then fomo about not getting to make that choice. At least anything of consequence. Just take me out to dinner. I\u2019ll buy myself the things I need. I wish I was different but here we are.", "Some people are really easy to get for and some aren't.  Some hobbies are easier to buy for than others.  This is why I love either lists or just agreeing 'hey we don't need to exchange gifts'.", "She could be me. My husband is extremely hard to buy for. Every time he finds something that he actually wants, he'll spend an hour shopping and comparing and reading up on reviews, checking to see if the reviews are fake, *materials lists*. Then 99% of the time he buys it. If he didn't buy it at this point, either he didn't want it, or it was cost prohibitive. So even if I buy off of his list, it's wrong. \n\nI've given up, too. His gifts are,\"Hey, Babe, you've got this much to spend. Go wild.\"", "Not the person you\u2019re asking, but I agonise over the decision. If I\u2019m just out and see something he\u2019ll like then I\u2019ll pick it up and he\u2019ll love it. A gift for birthday/christmas/anniversary? I bomb it every time.  \n\nConversely, my husband is an awful gift giver (or so he says). He\u2019s amazing at choosing a gift for me.", "My dad does this all the time for my mom, and it\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019ll barely remember having mentioned liking something, or forget about it entirely, then months later there it is. One time they were on vacation and he couldn\u2019t get back to the shop without her, so he called them later and bought it over the phone. Tiny shop, didn\u2019t normally do shipping, but they agreed to send it to him.", "That's fine; I'm just saying most of the people in my life don't do this. If I saw something in a store that caught my eye, I'd just buy it myself if I really liked it; it wouldn't occur to me to mention it to someone.", "Yes, I am not grateful for a plastic hunk of junk that's contributing to environmental degradation. I am not grateful for a cat t-shirt, especially since I haven't worn a t-shirt in over 5 years. I am not grateful for a car organizer when I do not drive. \n\nI am very grateful for someone choosing to give me a gift. I appreciate that very much.\n\nI don't really care if I seem ungrateful to you.", "That and you can't control when you get an idea. I've had some great ideas 6 months in advance that   turn out awesome. Then there's the times when you start looking a couple of months before, and nothing seems to click, so you keep looking and keep an open mind but nothing really seems to fit.", "That's a good point.", "I can't say I'm an excellent gift giver, I'm just wondering how it might be more difficult to give those you are closer/closest to in life, worse gifts than others. I'm an average gift giver, but just by sheer proximity, I'm around my partner so much more, that I pick up more of their wants, needs, and interests. I'm genuinely wondering what might be the case that friends get better or more thoughtful gifts than a spouse.", "Yeah, this is kind of what I'm wondering. Everyone seems to be giving me really valid answers (higher pressure, too many options, people who don't *need* things) but EbbWilling's comment seems to imply *bad* gifts, or dud gifts. Which makes me wonder if they're only duds because the recipient is hard to shop for.", "Cookies are an excellent gift! I can totally understand having a partner with intangible hobbies/interests, but it sounds like you compensate in another way. Original comment I replied to mentioned that the gifts are duds, so I'm wondering if their spouse is hard to please.", "Those sound like awesome gifts. Sorry they fell through. If those don't satisfy, then I too would probably assume my spouse is impossible to buy for.", "I keep a notebook, with a section for each family member. As they mention stuff here and there, I write it down, or, if it's something online, bookmark it. I have a folder divided into sections with each family members name. \n\nI'm pretty good at nailing gifts and that's all my trick is, one of the kids mentions an obscure new band, write it down, nab them a hoody for their birthday in 5 months time. \n\nIt's simple but you look like a GENIUS", "I keep a notebook, with a section for each family member.

Takes all the guess work out.", "I often find myself struggling more to get my partner something good than anyone else, because there are entirely too many options. So I can answer for why I sometimes struggle.\n\nThere are about 400 things I could get him, based on his interests and things he's mentioned. My best friend of 3 years- about 100. It's way more likely that what she mentions to me is important to her, but since I am with him all the time I hear more of his passing fancies. Does he really want to get into woodworking, or was it just a few funny tiktoks?", "Personally, I feel the standards are higher (and it feels like you\u2019re applying higher standards) and that applies a lot of pressure. And because I\u2019m bad at gift giving (a big part of which is I never know what to get anyone) I start getting frustrated. I also feel like I\u2019m not meeting those standards triggering anxiety and a bit of shame. All of that combined makes for a really bad shopping experience and I always end up being near a breakdown when Christmas shopping and that doesn\u2019t lead to good gifts. \n\nBut I can just buy my friend something from his steam library. Something that he has explicitly stated as wanting, but asking is bad for some reason.", "I'll give you me and wife for example. \n\nWe don't really have significant wants as we're older and doing fine, so if we want something we just buy it.\n\nWe have completely different hobbies. We do have some interest in each others' hobbies, but not deep enough to actually tell exactly what one might want and lack. So interests don't really work either (we tried, and while there were some successes most were off)\n\nSometimes we do pick up a great gift and it's awesome, but we've been together over 15 years... So it's has to happen just by the sheer number of gifts we went through.\n\nMaybe we're just difficult to gift for, as I don't recall any awesome gifts from anyone else either since my early 20's.", "I hate gifting. I am hard to shop for and I know this so I beg people not to buy me presents for any reason. I do not under any circumstances want people to get me anything, but people struggle with the emotional want to get a gift.", "I do this, too! Well, I use my notes app, but same concept.", "My partner does this for me as well (I can keep my list of gifts in my head :3) and it always makes me get all emotional when i mention something and happen to see her open the notes app haha"]}
