I think you're NTA for this particular gift. However, it's hard to say when it actually comes to your girlfriend.\n\nI think your entire first paragraph is kind of an excuse. Sometimes buying gifts sucks, sure. Especially if you don't know a person well and this is for a white elephant or something (but hey, that's what wine baskets were made for). But if you're close with a person, like a girlfriend, and you seriously can't think of something they would enjoy based on how well you know them, then you aren't listening very well. I am under the impression you may have given your girlfriend thoughtless gifts in the past and she's feeling resentful, though deciding to bring it up at a poor time.\n\nThe fact is, we're all constantly talking about what kinds of gifts would be important to us. Obviously, not intentionally. But by listening to your friends, knowing the wants, needs, and likes they talk about, you can easily become a fantastic gift-giver. Just by listening.", "Info: What gifts have you gotten her in the past and how has she reacted to them? Any examples?", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m like you, but I\u2019m thinking probably a little older so I\u2019ve learned how to cope with it a little better. Gift cards really aren\u2019t the way to go and you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve been phoning it in. But you don\u2019t know until you know. Make a list of everything your gf likes or does. Foods, hobbies, activities, studied in school, career, books and movies she likes and the clothes she wears. \n\nSo let\u2019s say she really likes gardening. Google \u201cunusual gifts for gardeners\u201d and the name of your city for ideas. Go to a garden center and ask for what can be planted this season. See if you can get an appointment with her and your local master gardener. Make her a planter out of one of your shoes. Find a botanical garden and plan a picnic. But for goodness sake don\u2019t buy her a gift card for Home Depot.", "YTA, not for the thoughtful gift that you put a lot of effort into for your best friend, but for the lack of effort and thoughtfulness that you've put into your girlfriend's gifts for a little over the past year.\n\nWhen I was 2 months into dating my current boyfriend, he was looking through my sketchbook and asked about a specific drawing of two very detailed and colorful frogs. I explained that I wanted to get a couple of custom ceramic frogs to decorate my fairytale section of my bookshelf since I couldn't find any that I liked. I happened across a shop that could make them, but it was too expensive at the time. Well, my boyfriend snuck my drawing out of my sketchbook and had both of my frogs made for me for Christmas the following month. They are by far my favorite Christmas presents, and I show them to everyone. \n\nNow I'm not saying that you have to get things custom made or spend a lot of money, but you need to pay more attention to specific things that your girlfriend either wants or that catches her attention. That will show her that you payed better attention and bothered to remember something besides the general gift cards for things she likes.", "YTA.

Have a conversation with gf about it where you explain your side and acknowledge how she may be hurt by the gift you gave your friend. You might be able to come up with a solution like her giving you basic ideas and you expanding on them. If gifts are part of her love language, you'll need to work together to meet that need. Also try listening to her and getting her small things she likes or needs more regularly (chocolate, flowers, etc.) or surprising her with a bigger thing when you can (fancy dinner, mini vacation, spa day, etc.).", "NTA for now, maybe an edit will change that if it turns out the girlfriend has been receiving really bad gifts. It's ok to give generic stuff like fancy dinners, gift vouchers - it's not ok to give stuff they clearly have no use for.\n\nYour gift for your friend isn't the sort of thing that can be repeated, it came about because of his book.

Make sure you explain to her that you being able to think of this gift for your friend is not a reflection on your feelings towards her, but a moment of growth with something you struggle with. I see this as you often struggle with thinking of unique thoughtful gifts and was proud of yourself for being able to improve this.

Write it down. When it becomes gift giving time, consult your list. \n\n-Make something, like what you did for your friend. My pandemic project was learning to crochet - I've since given many many little crocheted things as gifts. Even if it isn't some amazing thing, they really appreciate the time and effort more than anything. Play to your strengths. Do you wood work? Draw? Paint? Music? \n\n-Pay attention to her hobbies and her struggles. Find something that would make her life easier, or make her hobbies more enjoyable. \n\n-The best gift is one a person wouldn't buy (or wouldn't think to buy) for themselves, but are happy to have. This is important as you get older and have more disposable income, as people then just buy whatever they need. So stay away from needs and find some wants, especially if they're a little decadent. \n\n-If you're really desperate and your list is empty, you could at least pay attention to what she buys from the makeup store and buy that instead of a gift card. At least try dude.", "My husband has really bad adhd which causes memory issues. You know what he does?

We also endorse in our favourite snacks, listen to music in the car, have bookshelves, talk about our interests, have expensive cosmetics in the bathroom or wear a certain style of jewellery, just to name a few examples. When a friend constantly asks me to scratch her back I can be sure some handwritten vouchers for scratching her back in her gift will make her smile. My best friend is an artist. I see his work and we talk about styles and media. Therefore I know a sketchbook to keep his pencil practice pieces in one place, an acrylic starter set when I know he's interested in them or aquarelle pencils will suit him. He also always has cold feet so my hand knitted socks are also not a bad idea. He has the perfect gift idea 90% of the time. The other 10% are either me needing something within our budget but not being able to afford it or him being a little unsure and me giving him a long list he can pick and choose from for years. When I absolutely don't know what to do I ask. It's not hard to ask. My mom loves hand knitted socks and needs lots of hand balm. Two things to keep in mind. She also once got a shower product set she really liked. Well here's a third idea, there's something she likes but wouldn't usually buy.\n\nDo you really know not one of the examples mentioned about your friends?", "We do.

He likes Milwaukee tools and he will often say oh I really need one of these. I take a picture of it with its display tag, then when I need to buy a gift I go in home Depot and I show the salesperson my options and they help me pick one. You could do the same thing with makeup, jewelry, clothing anything!\n\n3) go into the Amazon search bar and put \"gifts for girlfriend\" or gifts for chicken lovers, gardeners, readers etc. You don't necessarily have to buy it off of Amazon, but their suggestions are usually very good.\n\nHope that helps!", "NAH. Your gift was wonderfully thoughtful but also a big leap in creativity from a gift card. GF is reasonably hurt that you don't put as much thought into hers. Possibly you think friend's interests are a little more intellectual while hers are merely make up and purses (as per comments). Which is condescending so somewhat AHish But, you sound as if you'd like to do better and you can if you follow these steps: remember that gifts are about receiver interests not giver. Next consider what you did for your friend and do likewise for GF ergo get creative. And makeup is a perfect interest as it's essentially an art media. I can think of 10 not at all phoned in gifts: handmade cosmetic rack, makeup mirror, vintage vanity or cosmetics set, museum specializing in makeup in different cultures, face painting kit, henna tattoo set, theatre makeup set, Opera tickets,backstage pass to theatre makeup dept, professional makeup session, books by celeb makeup artists, antique Maquillage box...or for lower budgets a nice set of brushes, or some colors you think would look good on her.\n \nYou can do this with anyone's interests if you just pay attention and brainstorm a little.

It's not like that, though.\n\nI'm a really good gift giver. I've gotten reactions like people crying from joy upon opening gifts, people still mentioning the gifts I gave them years later, etc. It took work to become good at it.\n\nThis is how I do it:\n\n* Every time the person mentions something purchasable that they like, WRITE IT DOWN.\n\n* Every time the person points out something they want, WRITE IT THE FUCK DOWN.\n\n* Every time the person mentions a problem they have, consider whether their problem could be solved by a gift. If the answer is yes, WRITE IT DOWN.\n\n* Pay attention to people's preferences, passions, etc. WRITE THEM DOWN.\n\nNEXT...\n\nWhen do you need to give somebody a present? Whenever that is, forget about waiting until that date is closer. Start picking their present NOW. Look at everything you've written down. Let all that information swirl around your brain. That alone will put you in a state of mind to have a present-related stroke of genius. I guarantee you'll manage to think something up if you give yourself months to do it.\n\nEven without a stroke of genius, though, the list will suggest great gift options. For instance, one of my exes hated when his drinks got watery. I got him whiskey stones to solve the problem.\n\nBut again, these lists will make strokes of genius more likely.

All she sees is you phoning it in on gifts most of the time, and then going unexpectedly thoughtful this once. She cannot read your inner workings, and she\u2019s probably seen similar behavior from men who are very different. \n\nI do think you can probably improve on gift giving, generally, even if not on a hitting-it-out-of-the-park level. Think about what happened with your friend here - you knew how much they had invested in something, helped out with it how you could, etc. and it basically made an idea happen. See if you can get similar insight into your gf\u2019s (or others\u2019) interests, hobbies, jobs, etc. Find out *why* they like the things they do or what it is they like about them, or try doing things with them. A bit of effort can go a long way in thinking of better gifts. \n\n\nAt the same time I also get your perspective. I\u2019m generally good at getting gifts for people, but there are some I almost always blank on and have no clue what to get them unless I have a similar \u201cstroke of genius\u201d or get really lucky and come across stuff. My dad is the big example here. There\u2019s been like *maybe* three gifts I\u2019ve gotten him that were huge hits he still talks about, mostly random thrift store finds, and the rest have all been the most generic \u201che\u2019ll get use out of it but it\u2019s totally not memorable\u201d variety, like literally a candle in the one scent he likes. He could very easily complain about me not getting thoughtful gifts compared to what I get others. \n\nSimilarly, I have an ex who got me really great, even creative gifts twice and the rest of the time phoned it in or went with what others advised. I can also attest that he generally was not good at gift giving. He was one of those \u201cbuy a gift card or something super generic the day of\u201d people and it drove me batty. But when he thought of something good, it was really good. \n\nThe TL;DR here is that I both see how what you\u2019re doing is not quite to the level of weaponized incompetence while also seeing why she probably feels slighted. If gift giving is important to her, more thought into someone else\u2019s gift may translate to her thinking you don\u2019t care as much about her as them.

They tend to not be very observant. They get caught up in their own stuff and in general don\u2019t notice other people\u2019s likes, dislikes, passions *unless* they happen to line up or are directly at odds with the giver.\n\n2. They struggle with empathy. People that struggle with empathy are not terrible people, as some would have you believe, but people that have difficulty pretending to be another person. Empathy can be really important with gift giving - it helps you mentally try out the gift to see if the person will enjoy it. People that struggle with empathy typically give gifts that *they* would like to receive.\n\n3.  Finding the right gift because of #1 and #2 makes the process time consuming and overwhelming, so they go the path of least resistance and do cash, gift cards, or rely on specific requests.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s seemed to work for most of my friends that struggle is: \n\n1. At a neutral time, when there\u2019s no pressure, make a list of family and friends you\u2019d like to be able to give thoughtful gifts to, give each person their own page. \n\n2. On the page capture: likes, passions, hobbies, personal goals, annoyances (surprisingly people love a gift that is a solver of or a nod to an annoyance)\n\n3. Notes about your connection with the person: shared inside jokes just the two of you have, where you met, a favorite day together, shared love/hate of a certain thing.\n\n4. Keep the pages someplace safe. \n\n5. When gift time rolls around, pull out the paper and generate some ideas.\n\nIt is absolutely possible to learn how to be a thoughtful gift giver, the wrong time to attempt it, when your 2 days away from the important date and now have pressure blocking you from thinking clearly and not being overwhelmed.\n\nI\u2019d say good luck, but you\u2019re capable of better - so do!", "NTA.

I am guessing that you and your girlfriend are fairly young, so take it from an old lady (35f) your not the AH...... My husband is not a good gift picker.... haha  I used my adult brain and figured that instead of getting mad at him or being disappointed, I would take the heat off of him by making a list on amazon with everything I want so he has options to choose from.

My husband, on the other hand, bought into the great marketing machine and believed every female wanted diamonds, gold and exotic perfume for gifts.  I wanted none of those things and it took me years (and a couple really eye-opening actions) to convince him to stop buying them for me.  Gift-giving was NOT our love language!  We solved the problem by making two lists of books - one for him and one for me.  Whenever a gift-giving occasion was coming up, we would consult the lists and order up one of the titles. Frequently these were out-of-print editions or historical biographies that weren't available locally.  Worked for us.\n\nOP, I suggest that you ask your girlfriend what kinds of gifts she would like to receive and make a list.

I also began making ramen more often and going all out with it while ditching the packet. He got me a ramen bowl with chopsticks. Neither of these things were asked for, but are used on a weekly basis. He simply observed what I was liking and doing and found something that would make that activity more enjoyable.

He still got me things sometimes and I appreciated it but they weren\u2019t as thoughtful or nice as the gifts I got him. I get he was in between jobs a lot since he kept getting fired from those jobs or had to quit.

I put a lot of pressure on myself to get something thoughtful because so many people make the same assumption you do and I didn\u2019t want her to think that I didn\u2019t put effort or thought into it.

It made me indecisive and hesitant, and I would end up with something last minute just because I had to make a decision and no decision ever felt good enough and I\u2019d end up feeling even worse. Fortunately, my wife is amazing in a lot of other ways too and she recognized that I\u2019m just not good at this and took a lot of the pressure off of me. She handles most of the holiday gift giving on my behalf, and we\u2019ve stopped doing gifts for the traditional events like birthdays and anniversaries. It\u2019s really helped us both out, because I\u2019m still really really bad at Christmas, but I\u2019ve gotten really really good at random tuesdays when I see her favorite flowers on display and leave them in her car as a surprise for when she gets off work. \n\nTl:Dr People have different strengths and for people who suck at gifts the added pressure can make picking out a gift even more difficult.

Sure the person receiving a gift card has to go shop for their own gift, but they don\u2019t have to work and earn that money, which often times would but far longer than a shopping trip, generally much less enjoyable, and tends to be somewhere they planned to shop anyway. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of people saying it\u2019s ridiculous to \u201cnot know\u201d what to get your girlfriend, but it really can be tough. My husband always finds me amazing, unexpected yet perfect gifts. I\u2026 struggle to find him equal gifts. I often just ask him outright what he wants, or get him gaming gift cards to use when he finds something he\u2019d like. We\u2019ve been married over a decade, and together a handful more years beyond that. He is my person and I love him endlessly, but purchasing gifts for him is my kryptonite, my downfall, my trapped in a horror movie moment. \n\nI think something people don\u2019t realize or forget about is that as an adult people can buy themselves things they want. So I might have an idea of something super awesome that my husband would love, only to realize he\u2019s purchased it for himself! Same goes for other family members. It really can be hard to purchase things for someone, even someone we\u2019re very close to and care deeply about, when that person has the ability to get things they want for themselves.\n\nI\u2019ve seen references to the fact that you buy her makeup/beauty gift cards, and people being very offended. Personally I wear makeup *maybe* twice a year. It\u2019s not my thing.  Like at all. But I just gifted my tattoo artist an Ulta gift card for her birthday because she LOVES makeup. She wears it for herself and really enjoys doing her makeup every day. If you\u2019re just getting those because \u201cgirls like makeup\u201d, sure, you would lean to being TA, but if she\u2019s into makeup or it\u2019s something she purchases frequently I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in poor taste. This isn\u2019t the same as buying an Outback Steakhouse gift card to gift to a vegan.  \n\nAs a final thought, have you asked her what kind of gifts she\u2019s hoping to receive? I know it can feel like the gift needs to be a secret or surprise, but honestly I always lean to the idea that a gift that\u2019s wanted but doesn\u2019t bring a surprise is better than a surprise gift that doesn\u2019t hit the mark.", "NTA.

If you do not feel this way about your girlfriend, you are dating the wrong girl and wasting her time.", "That\u2019s because you care way more about your friend than your gf.", "You are getting roasted hard here so I'm just going to offer a few tips.\n\n1. It's hard to come up with great ideas spontaneously.  You're not going to have an epiphany mindlessly wandering around the mall the day before.  But over the course of a year, I'd bet you occasionally see things and think \"she would really like this.\"  WRITE IT DOWN!  Put a note in your phone and add to it every time you think of something.  Also good to do this for other people you might be giving gifts to like parents, siblings, friends, etc.\n2. ALWAYS include a hand-written card with any gift to her, even if you do have to go the gift card route.  And don't get the generic hallmark crap.  Go to Etsy and get some handmade ones.  They are unique, more interesting designs, better quality, and hardly cost more than what you find in the drug store aisle.  Key is to not just scrawl \"Happy birthday, Love sunni\" but to write about what she means to you, what she brings to your life, favorite memories, etc.\n3. Speaking of Etsy, it's a goldmine.  Just do searches for stuff that she likes and you'll get a ton of ideas.  Travel?  Harry Potter?  Cats?  Tea?  Hayao Miyazaki movies?  19th century European stamps?  Doesn't matter, you'll probably get dozens of options you wouldn't have thought of.\n4. Experiences also make for great gifts.  Plan a weekend away at a B&B or even just a day tour of some wineries or breweries.  Do an escape room.  Drive out to the middle of nowhere (on a clear night/new moon) and go stargazing.  Get tickets to watch her favorite sports team, band.  Sign up for a cooking class together.  Take her to the aquarium, the zoo, the amusement park, the arcade.  Volunteer together for an organization or cause that she cares about.  Get a girl's spa package for her and her mom/sister/friend.  Or book a couple's massage.  OR get some scented candles, apricot oil, and give her a massage yourself after a day of doing the things above.\n5. Since she likes makeup, don't get generic gift cards, get her a beauty box subscription.  My wife is into Korean beauty products and I don't have the slightest clue what any of them are so I got a subscription for her birthday once.  It's genius because she can try a bunch of new things and see what she likes, AND she gets a new box of surprises every month that remind her that it was a gift from you.\n6. Finally there are the gifts that require what I call playing the long game.  For example, if she likes wine, keep all the corks.  Get a display box (again, off Etsy) with the corks in it and then a nice bottle of champagne to add one more on her birthday.  Another option is to collect your favorite photos of your time dating and make a photobook on Shutterfly or a similar service.  I did this once for a vacation to South Africa and had a lot of fun picking out the best photos and designing it, plus it makes for a great coffee table book.  Or the granddaddy of them all, write a short note about what you like about her every day (or every week, if you want to be more reasonable).  Then fold up the notes and keep them in a decorative box.  When you gift it, tell her she can open one note every day/week, taking her all the way to the next birthday/anniversary/etc.  These aren't easy to pull off as they require some degree of sustained energy, but that's what makes them special.  If you can pull something like these off it is a guaranteed home run.\n\nIf you think about the above points, you'll realize that like 90% of it boils down to putting in the effort.  It's about showing someone that you didn't just do the bare minimum, rather you're giving them the level of attention commensurate with how important they are to you.  \"It's the thought that counts\" is a total cliche and also 100% true.", "So instead of getting her a kinda personal gift that is at least thoughtful\u2026 you get her a totally impersonal gift card where she then has to do her own shopping? YTA", "Honestly, it was a risky move for OP, depending on what \"near completion\" means. As someone in academia, I would be very touched, but also very cranky if someone did all that on a draft that wasn't final. The thought definitely counts (hence being touched), but I'd rather not have anything but my final draft memorialized. \n\nThat said, you lose me with your second paragraph. \n\n>But no, all she cares about is whether OP is sufficiently devoted to her.\n\nI mean, if the extent of OP's gifts for her until that point were gift cards with the explanation of \"idk I'm bad a gifts\" and there have been opportunities to memorialize her achievements along the way, that's a legitimate concern. \n\n>If a guy does something with someone else or for someone else, there are GFs who will immediately leap to the conclusion that he has love to give that he\u2019s not giving to HER.\n\nThere are plenty of men who think that about girlfriends being thoughtful to others as well. And when stated this way, it's a problem. \n\nBut going from \"here's a gift card\" to \"here's a copy of your dissertation with a heartfelt about-the-author I wrote for you\" is a massive leap.
