Some info first: i recently moved into new flat. Its 4 bedroom, 5 people are living there and 6th is supposed to move in. Its me(M22) my bf Charles (20M), Elizabeth(F26), Marry-Anne(F26), Victor(35M). All people moved in at the start of the this month. Victor is working fulltime and most of the time he is not here. Me and my bf are currently studying and working part time. Elizabeth and Marry-Anne just graduated and they have jobs but i dont know more. \n\nI recently had argument with Elizabeth because she keeps bringing random people into our flat without asking or even warning us in advance. She argued that they are not random people to her and that she is doing this so that they dont have to pay for hotels while they travel through city. So far she brough 2 people (her cousin(F) and her friend( M). The issue i have is that rent is expensive in our city and there is not enough big selection of affordable flats for my and my bf, and that these people come into our flat, they usurp our resources(electricity, water) and time ( i cant use kitchen, toilet, bathroom). Its already hard enough for 5 people living there (with 6th about to move in) to accommodate each other.  And also that Elizabeth acts arrogant,like its her flat, she keeps light on, in the middle of the night, doesnt clean after herself, uses our kitchen stuff...So i confronted her, and told her that i (and my bf) dont like it and would like her to stop. \n\nSo far we didnt talked about it in person only through Facebook and in our group chat. \nVictor said he has no problem with it. Same for Marry-Anne (she is her friend, roommate and colleague-people that Elizabeth brings stay in her bed)\nMe and my bf see is as issue.\nAnd so far she brough: her cousin who stayed for 3 night last week.\nHer friend who came 2 days ago and stayed for 1 night. \nAnd yesterday her cousin came again and she wrote us that she ll be staying for 2 nights.\nMe and my bf are currently out of the city. \nSo i would like to know if i am the asshole. \nP.s.: Sorry for grammar, english is not my native language. And all names are fake.\n\n\nEDIT: sooo, i showed this post to my bf, and he told me that i forgot to write down 1 other issue that we have with Elizabeth. She broke our (all flatmates) washing mashine. She basically filled it so much that the door couldn't be closed and she put things in there that shouldn't be washed only in hand. After that she found her stuff in washing machine not washed and completely soaked. She didnt told anyone, so it took us another day to figure out, only then she admittedwhat happened. She then brought up the subject of buying a new one, but that we all should buy it together.", "created_utc": 1689772908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153ux65/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_to_stop_bringing/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But where I live, people are allowed to bring short-term guests into their apartments (i.e., flats) without the landlord's prior approval. Since you are her flatmates, I don't see how you can force her not to bring short-term guests, if doing so legal.\n\nThe second issue which you raise is really an issue of the \"house rules.\"  It seems to me that all of you in the flat need to have a meeting to arrive at common agreements about things such as (a) keeping the common areas clean and (b) informing others, ahead of time about short term visitors. \n\nNAH", "Esh-I\u2019m assuming you have never lived with non-family members \n your roommate should be letting others she will have guest. \nNow let\u2019s get to you- it is unreasonable for you to think no one will ever have guests over unless you sign a lease saying so. I mean are you gonna ban the others from brining their SOs or potential bf\u2019s/gfs bc you don\u2019t want to wait to use the restroom. You live in a share house- you didn\u2019t mention that the house has an official schedule for when people use communal spaces therefore you have no expectation to have free access to shared bathrooms or the kitchen. Yeah it\u2019s annoying to have to wait to cook, but this is the compromise you made when you moved there. Also you said you confronted her- this makes you the bigger AH. And by this I mean the fact you used the word confront - not ask or talk. If you confront which in my mind means you are coming from a place of aggression, you will get nowhere with someone to change their minds, in fact they will often double down on their behaviors bc they now think your aggressive and mean. \n\nYou are welcome to have a house meeting and ask if they would be willing to set up a few rules for overnight guests. Reasonable asks would be a heads up in a group text that they will have guest on X day, that paramours not stay in the house once the roommate leaves unless okayed by the majority of the group, no guests for longer than 3/4 consecutive nights, and any guests who is violent or aggressive can\u2019t come back. However I wouldn\u2019t try to get them to pay for guests spending the night, that\u2019s too much.", "ESH\n\nHer cousin is not 'random people'. She's allowed to invite people overnight. However a polite thing to do is to give some heads up and to make sure that her flatmates are not inconvenienced. As I see it both Elizabeth and Marry are hosting. The guests are even staying in Marry's bed. Could be that this cousin is her bf or something.\n\nAnyway, have a meeting and ask Elizabeth and Marry to pay more for expenses and to give a prior notice, at least a few hours. It's very easy with the group chat. You can also ask the landlord what's the policy for extra people staying over all the time.", "* I recently had argument with Elizabeth because she keeps bringing random people into our flat without asking or even warning us in advance. \n\nShe doesn't have to ask or warn you. If she lives there and she pays rent, she's not obligated to warn you or ask your permission. Unless this was agreed upon before she moved in.", "It\u2019s so important to have all roommates sign a Code of Conduct agreement which clearly states these items and others. \n\nHow many days per month can you have overnight guests? \n\nHow many consecutive days are guests allowed over before that roommate must pay more for utilities/rent for their stay. \n\nAll housemates must be alerted through group text when you have guests over. \n\nIf throwing a party you must inform all housemates 48hrs prior. And you have to clean up the party within 24hrs. \n\nAll potential pets must be discussed and approved prior with all housemates before bringing into the home. \n\nWhat is the agreement for sub leases? Drug use in the home? Damage to others belongings? Etc etc. \n\nYou may be thinking some of this is overkill. I had a prior roommate cooking their dinner on the stove, got high and fell asleep. I wake up to the smell of smoke several hours later and the pan was literally melting into the open flame of the stovetop. Could\u2019ve ended really badly. Apparently the same roommate had decided days prior to disable the fire alarm in the kitchen because it was \u201ceasier\u201d than opening a window or turning on the stove fan when they cooked. WILD. It was my pan and he refused to replace it. Which whatever. At that point I was happy it was just a pan I lost not my whole ass life. \n\nThese are all things that should\u2019ve been defined prior to these people moving in. Best way forward is to have a house meeting and ask the roommates what\u2019s important for them. Then draft up a document for everyone to review.

How often will this be happening? A few days here and there isn't a huge deal imo.

If they use a lot of extra resources just make that roommate through in a few extra $ that month.", "NTA - She is pushing up the bill costs without compensating for it, and causing an inconvenience to the actual residents. This is also highly likely a violation of your tenancy contract. I'm not a lawyer but I would check with your landlord as you are in a shared flat if this is allowed, and it is possible that she will be asked to move out.", "If they stay they pay.", "NTA. But please go talk with the landlord. They will typically have a rule about guests and limitations on how long they can be there.", "I would be annoyed because of the extra usage of the facilities. I would be beyond pissed that she broke the washing machine, and wants EVERYONE to chip in and get a new one. I'm sorry, but your flatmate sounds horrible.", "You should make the roommate pay extra utilities due to the extra company", "YTA. People can have guests, even overnight guests, w/o getting permission from roommates/flatmates. \n\nYes, ideally in a friendly situation people will give each other a heads-up that they're having guests but it is absolutely wild to think you have the right to say yes or no to guests.", "So, you have a problem of the commons. You both share resources, and value those resources differently. She values the ability to use what's available to help others \\[or to be seen to be helpful if we want to be nasty\\]. \n\nYou value the ability to be secure, comfortable, and have some degree of predictability. \n\nThe problem is that your home doesn't seem to have an agreement about how the commons should be used. \n\nEveryone is at fault as long as you are all in a state of anarchy. Unless you've tried to bring everyone to the table to create house-rules, then you're all at fault for misuse. \n\nThat said, not all misuse is equal. As you point out, her use is impacting you in an unpredictable way. When you signed up to live there, you presumed you'd only have to share the toilet / kitchen / power with X people, and now find out it's X + Y people. It would be like if you signed a lease for you and your BF, and then brought along your two children and mother-in-law's favorite pool boy. They didn't agree to the whole circus, how unfair!\n\nSo while everyone has some fault here, I do think her error is more obvious and reflective of poor behavior. \n\nNTA.", "yta\n\nsorry but seem like you and your boyfriend are the ones with the issues\n\nas long as she pays her bills who cares she has a right to invite people round and sleep\n\nif you dont like living with others then dont \n\n also that Elizabeth acts arrogant,like its her flat,      your doing the same thing acting like its just yours and your boyfriend", "NTA  Very rude of Elizabeth to bring overnight guests to SHARED apartment.

Are they in a different financial situation than you and BF? Can you suggest why they don\u2019t have issue with Elizabeth bringing guests around? I am not going to change my judgement until I can get more information", "NTA- If someone who pays rent has an issue with unannounced guests, then they should not be staying the night.", "YTA, you can\u2019t expect people to never have guests over. They might be random people to you, but they aren\u2019t to her. You could instead ask for her to pitch in a little more for utilities on months when she has people over, but a couple days a month really is not a whole lot.", "NTA. It\u2019s basic courtesy when you are living in a shared house to check and agree with others before having a guest to stay.", "Kind of on the fence on this but I'd say NTA, your roommates should be respectful about bringing guests that her roommates might not be comfortable with. If she MUST bring them despite her roommates not liking it, then have them stay in her room and not share any of the common spaces unless they absolutely need it (like to use the bathroom or something).\n\nCalling them \"random people\" is kind of rude though, so I can see why she's being rude back to you. When I first read this I thought your roommate was bringing in randoms that she met at random parties on different nights or something. Sounds like it's just two people she's close with that she wants around once in a while. \n\nHow would you feel if at some point some really close friend or your family was in town and you want to bring them into your living space for a bit, Elizabeth starts calling them \"random people\".

Extremes exist sure, but at the very least she should be able to have guests over. \n\nOP's fault for not discussing guidelines and rules when moving into a place with a bunch of people. Obviously, people have different expectations.", "OP and his BF, as well as the other flat mates, better have locking doors on their rooms.  That way they can secure their stuff while out.  Because, sooner or later, there\u2019s going to be a thief invited in.", "Ask the owner.  It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re living in an air bnb.", "Okay, but are you going to let the other people who live there know or are the overnight guest just going to show up? I\u2019m saying you let others know beforehand.", "I would let them know, but ultimately it's not a question. It's a heads up, because I pay rent too. \n\nI understand OP's struggles. I would hate people I don't know in my home, but that's why I don't have any roommates. I went through that for years when I was younger.", "OP was misgendered in the other comment. That matters.", "So misgendering someone is ok? I never said that the fact they are male made a difference.", "The comment misgendered the OP.", "I think your English is great. Has she ever lived with roommates before? I mean some people haven\u2019t and you know, THAT can be an issue.", "Ok Thank you!!", "OP's gender has no relevance in the discussion of finding a stranger in your house."]}
