That's just ... childish. My guess is that your parents feel like they sacrificed their own opportunities to be successful by having a baby so young, so they need to take credit now. I don't think that's a good excuse, just an excuse. On the other hand, even if they were negligent parents, parenting takes a lot of self-sacrifice. All but the worst parents deserve some of the credit for raising functioning adults. But expecting a 15 year old to show gratitude for that is unrealistic and celebrating their own success instead of their child's is gross.", "NAH. \n\nI don't think it's possible to properly raise a baby when you're still a child yourself. They probably did give up quite a bit, even if it's not apparent to you at this time. \n\nThey shouldn't be taking credit for your hard work if they didn't help with homework, reading bedtime stories, etc.", "NTA. Your comment to them should be an eye opener for them to start to repair your relationship. They obviously held down a household and a new baby at such a young age. I hope as you get older you can look back with a softer lens. I have young parents too and they worked really hard to have a household and because i have a huge extended family that did raise me, comments like that also really irked me. And I\u2019ve clapped back plenty of times even though I know they did their best. It\u2019s only now as a parent that I look back feeling sorry for them. I\u2019m sure they would have loved to raise you as older, more successful, healed parents. But God knew they needed you more then they needed themselves. God bless you all.", "NAH what you are describing is typical, as far as parents being very self congratulatory and the kids having a very different opinion on that.  \n\n>parents started saying (my name) must have gotten that quality from me.\n\nYou don't have to agree with their statement, but it's worth pointing out that what they were saying does not take away from your work or your academic achievement. The two ideas can co-exist. \n\nAlso seems worth adding that if we take it at face value, their neglect opened up space for you to become as self sufficient as you are. So while it's kind of back handed towards them, they did have a hand in things. It doesn't take anything away from you and it certainly does not take away from work you have put in. \n\nYou have every right to feel annoyed. They also have every right to feel proud of you, which is what I think fueld their debate. Parents are weird. I'm a parent, we get weird. Lack of sleep and nostalgia are quite powerful.", "NTA - I was a little older than your parents when I had my son, he\u2019s 16 now and an absolute brain-box. I was on my own with my boy, no Dad, no family support, just me and him and some great childcare provider choices. I would never take any credit for what he has achieved or how wonderful he is. That\u2019s all him. I provided the home, food, love and support, his intelligence is his own and I\u2019m sorry your parents don\u2019t see that yours is also your own.", "NAH. It's totally understandable that you are feeling it's your accomplishment and yours alone, but to be honest, if they had a baby at basically your age, were thrown to the wolves, and managed to stay together, keep a roof over your head, not get you taken by a CPS and raise you to the point where you can take AP classes and THRIVE, they must have been doing something right. Imagine how well would you fair if you were given a baby and no support right now.", "NAH.\n\nWhen they are taking credit for things you have done, they are expressing that they are proud of you.  But you weren't wrong to correct them and point out that these are YOUR accomplishments.\n\nI'm sorry your parents have been irresponsible at times due to their young age. However, the fact that they are still together and you're dong well in school suggests they did a few things right along the way. They may not have done it perfectly, but they DID sacrifice a lot to raise you. It sounds like you're about the age they were when they had you.  As you move forward through big life events over the next few years, just imagine if you were doing so while tending to a baby.", "NAH. Hun, it sounds like they were thrown to the wolves when they had you. For you to be doing as well as you are, for your parents to be as *young* as they were when they had you, with *no support system,* you should be a little more grateful.", "NAH", "NTA", "It's perfectly normal and factual to attribute certain qualities to the genetic contribution of a parent while recognizing that said parent was not an attentive parent that necessarily contributed to a subjective success rate. \n\nYou sound bitter and entitled. They were simply comparing you at your age to qualities they may also possess and you took it as a backwards narcissistic attempt.... It's incredibly entitled of you.\n\nYou need therapy because clearly there's some pent up resentment. \n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Being young don't exonerate them from responsibility.", "NTA\n\nWho forgets their own kid's birthday. Jeez!  I can see a future of NC", "So you're saying two things that don't add up.   \n\n\nFirst, you're saying your parents were extremely neglectful.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, you're saying you are in AP English.   \n\n\nI was in AP courses in high school. You don't just automatically go into AP classes you have to show talent and I don't know of anyone that, specifically English, that took those classes with little to no help at home. Almost everyone I've ever met who has neglectful parents had horrible study habits because their parents were never around to help them in their formative years.   \n\n\nOf course, this isn't to say you don't have an intellect level off the charts, I don't know you. But it is to say that, you're saying your parents didn't take you to the doctor or school or anything but somehow you learned to read and comprehend the English language remarkably well in the last 10 years enough to get enrolled in AP classes without any help whatsoever from your parents, in that they never helped you with homework or read to you, or worked with you to understand things   \n\n\nIf you've literally done all of this on your own, then no your not the AH and if you haven't you're still not the AH but neither are your parents.", "YTA. \n\n>Parents who had me very young (f30) and (m31\n\nAnd having a kid at 30 is not \"very young\".

Have you seen the news? A lot of parents can't even do that.", "She doesn't need to be 'grateful\" that her parents were irresponsible and decided to have her as kids. This is silly and how so many abusive parents think-- that their children owe their parents anything.", "I\u2019m down voting this because my parents never helped me with homework. It was the teachers who helped me with study habits - the ones who would help me work through other crap going on at home. I took all AP classes, my parents wouldn\u2019t have known shit about how to enroll me. Yea - I enrolled myself in high school because they forgot", "Okay, first it\u2019s not that they wouldn\u2019t take me to school or the doctors they would just forget to take me. As a kid, I became interested in learning on my own.  at a pretty young age, I started going to the library and talking to strangers who seemed nice or talking to teachers to get any advice. I wanted to learn so I got advice from basically anyone willing to help me out. I was able to form my work ethic just by being determined as a young kid and listening to advice.", "I know someone who grew up in an abusive home and was kicked out and homeless at 16 and graduated as valedictorian.", "Yeeeaaahhh I gotta disagree. The idea only kids from good homes can achieve what you did unless they are a genius is a pretty awful thing to say really.\n\nI got some of the best grades in my school with a shitty home life.\n\nPlus its not exactly sound logic to think because something is true in your personal experience it must be true universally.\n\n\"Having neglectful parents is mutually exclusive with being in AP classes\"\n\nI actually can't get over it. This is one of the most earnestly elitist and prejudiced comments I have ever read.", "Yeah, either OP is a genius, or the parents aren't as neglectful and actually managed to instill a good work ethic in her if nothing else.

Us parents do that, and sometimes my kids jump in in the melee and draw the line to from which side they got what we are proud of, or simply say it is an anomaly.  I understand you have some resentment to your upbringing and those feelings are valid.

She single handedly got her 4 siblings out of bed, changed the wet sheets (2 of them wet the bed until they were adolescents) gave them breakfast, got them dressed and to school, walked them home, helped with their homework, did other chores and pretty much raised them while her mother literally sat on the computer and played games all day. \n\nThen her step father would come home and berate her (the child) for the house being a mess.\n\nHer siblings got a much better upbringing than they would have if she wasn't there and the adults had to do it. Sad and disgusting but true.", "\"Smarts\" are hardly genetic, mostly being a result of environmental factors. Seems to me that the parents did not contribute much to such factors.\n\nIt is perfectly normal for parents to be proud of their children's achievements, but taking credit for them is sucky behavior, especially when they weren't much of a part of anything in the child's life."]}
