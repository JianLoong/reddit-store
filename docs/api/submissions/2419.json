That's just ... childish. My guess is that your parents feel like they sacrificed their own opportunities to be successful by having a baby so young, so they need to take credit now. I don't think that's a good excuse, just an excuse. On the other hand, even if they were negligent parents, parenting takes a lot of self-sacrifice. All but the worst parents deserve some of the credit for raising functioning adults. But expecting a 15 year old to show gratitude for that is unrealistic and celebrating their own success instead of their child's is gross.", "NAH. \n\nI don't think it's possible to properly raise a baby when you're still a child yourself. They probably did give up quite a bit, even if it's not apparent to you at this time. \n\nThey shouldn't be taking credit for your hard work if they didn't help with homework, reading bedtime stories, etc.", "NTA. Your comment to them should be an eye opener for them to start to repair your relationship. They obviously held down a household and a new baby at such a young age. I hope as you get older you can look back with a softer lens. I have young parents too and they worked really hard to have a household and because i have a huge extended family that did raise me, comments like that also really irked me. And I\u2019ve clapped back plenty of times even though I know they did their best. It\u2019s only now as a parent that I look back feeling sorry for them. I\u2019m sure they would have loved to raise you as older, more successful, healed parents. But God knew they needed you more then they needed themselves. God bless you all.", "NAH what you are describing is typical, as far as parents being very self congratulatory and the kids having a very different opinion on that.  \n\n>parents started saying (my name) must have gotten that quality from me.\n\nYou don't have to agree with their statement, but it's worth pointing out that what they were saying does not take away from your work or your academic achievement. The two ideas can co-exist. \n\nAlso seems worth adding that if we take it at face value, their neglect opened up space for you to become as self sufficient as you are. So while it's kind of back handed towards them, they did have a hand in things. It doesn't take anything away from you and it certainly does not take away from work you have put in. \n\nYou have every right to feel annoyed. They also have every right to feel proud of you, which is what I think fueld their debate. Parents are weird. I'm a parent, we get weird. Lack of sleep and nostalgia are quite powerful.", "NTA - I was a little older than your parents when I had my son, he\u2019s 16 now and an absolute brain-box. I was on my own with my boy, no Dad, no family support, just me and him and some great childcare provider choices. I would never take any credit for what he has achieved or how wonderful he is. That\u2019s all him. I provided the home, food, love and support, his intelligence is his own and I\u2019m sorry your parents don\u2019t see that yours is also your own.", "NAH. It's totally understandable that you are feeling it's your accomplishment and yours alone, but to be honest, if they had a baby at basically your age, were thrown to the wolves, and managed to stay together, keep a roof over your head, not get you taken by a CPS and raise you to the point where you can take AP classes and THRIVE, they must have been doing something right. Imagine how well would you fair if you were given a baby and no support right now.", "NAH.\n\nWhen they are taking credit for things you have done, they are expressing that they are proud of you.  But you weren't wrong to correct them and point out that these are YOUR accomplishments.\n\nI'm sorry your parents have been irresponsible at times due to their young age. However, the fact that they are still together and you're dong well in school suggests they did a few things right along the way. They may not have done it perfectly, but they DID sacrifice a lot to raise you. It sounds like you're about the age they were when they had you.  As you move forward through big life events over the next few years, just imagine if you were doing so while tending to a baby.", "NAH.
