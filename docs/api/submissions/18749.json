I thought I might be jumping to conclusions so I checked your profile and your previous post confirms my suspicions.  \n\nI get the sense that he needs to control and possess everything of you and yours, and the box is a symbol of that.  I hope you can get some support to protect you and your child. \n\nEmotional and financial abuse can be subtle but just as devastating as physical abuse.\n\nYou might want to consider making regular trips to the local library as an \u201cenrichment activity\u201d for your child, and then using the free internet there so you have privacy.

But the age difference says to me that he has chosen you because he thinks he can manipulate you and make you behave the way he wants. He wants a bangmaid and he wants you to do all the work of the house and the mental load so he doesn't have to. Your boxes aren't important to him. Your wants or needs aren't important to him. All that matters is that he is comfortable and getting cared for and you continued to buy into your place in his world. NTA", "Given the age difference, the fact that you're disabled on top of it, the uneven domestic labor that also leaves you conveniently exhausted, and the deliberate stomping on your very reasonable boundaries (because you're not supposed to have any about anything), you are in an abusive situation. He got you pregnant to trap you. He's keeping you tired and wearing you down so you won't leave or tell him no.\n\nAsk for help. Plan the best exit strategy for you and the kiddo and get out of there.", "NTA.\n\n 33yo man impregnated a 19yo and as it turns out, he's a lazy ass who thinks money and sperm are all he needs to contribute.  What shocking news! \n\nDude works 25 hours a week.  He needs to be pulling his weight.  But tbh this kind of man isn't going to change so you should really consider leaving rather than teach your kid that his behavior is something you should be tolerating.", "NTA, but holy age gap batman.   \n\n\nI'm sure this is largely about the 33 year old who had a kid with someone who maybe just graduated high school needing power over you and not wanting you to have anything nice of your own, but on the off-chance it isn't... why not just get another less fancy box for the table? That would solve the actual problem.", "Nta. This man is horrible and so is that age gap, given you have several chronic illness. A child at 18 Op, this man has certainly groomed you. Happy birthday, and something tells me he picks fights so he'd storm off and not buy you a present.", "NTA - It's not too much to ask to have your own things and your own space in your own home. Just because you married him does not mean you gave up all autonomy and all rights to singular possessions.", "Sounds like there is a reason he is 14 years older then you and you need to work on an escape plan. NTA, but not in a good, loving, respectful relationship either.", "NTA. It sounds like you really love these boxes and do not want them to be ruined. Your husband is TA for not taking your feelings into consideration. If it\u2019s so hard for him to take the charger out of the closet, why doesn\u2019t he just leave those items on the dining table if he is just going back and forth every day?\n\nSounds like you have bigger issues in your marriage if he nags and starts fights every year before your birthday. I feel for you and hope this gets resolved.", "NTA  -  Your husband is a big AH and should be helping you out more", "NTA. This whole post is concerning. He seems controlling and manipulative. If your husband is working so infrequently, I'm assuming he makes a lot of money. If you feel safe doing so, I'd talking to him about hiring someone to take some of the chores off your plate. His job hours are 20hrs/4 days a week, your job hours are 24hrs/7 days a week. \n\nJust...yikes.
