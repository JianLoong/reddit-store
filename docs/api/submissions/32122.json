Are you jealous?  Otherwise I cannot think of a reason you would be so cruel and unsympathetic to your sister.  Stop putting her down and look for ways to help her through.", "YTA.  All Alia was doing was telling you about what she's going through.  She's struggling and wanted someone to talk to and you immediately shut her down.  You should be apologizing profusely to her.", "YTA. It honestly sounds like you have some hard feelings about your parents supporting her to study abroad and you\u2019re maybe unintentionally taking it out on her by not being supportive. Yes, it was her decision to study abroad and it comes with certain downsides like making new friends. But, just because that\u2019s a struggle she chose doesn\u2019t mean that makes it any easier. It\u2019s important to support your siblings! Especially since your sister is living somewhere with no support system. It\u2019s important for her to know you\u2019re still there.", "YTA\n\nI chose to study abroad for postgrad. I didn\u2019t share her experiences (I\u2019m white and was in a predominantly white program), but it is scary to be put in a place where you don\u2019t know anyone or have a support system physically there. Your \u201cadvice\u201d is unhelpful. I can think of a million other ways you could have done that conversation. \n\nYou honestly sound jealous and resentful.

I had to be selected, work hard (at university and at my job to make money for the year) to be able to go. And yet, the first weeks were hell. I couldn't understand the people (strong accents) and had no idea how I would be able to graduate. So yeah, I complained and sometimes asked myself why I made this decision. It's one thing to prepare for moving abroad and it's a entirely different beast to live abroad. I 100% don't regret my year, once I got past the doubts and loneliness but I am glad my family was here to listen to me when I was down.\n\nYou sounds jealous and it's not a good look.", "YTA. Damn you're straight up cruel.", "YTA of course she can still complain if a choice she made isn't all she thought it would be.

On top of that she is experiencing a new culture. She felt she could open up to you and you dismissed her. She just needs a bit of a chat and some support. \n\nCall her back. Tell her you're sorry and want to talk through what might help. There will eb student support services. Clubs and societies. Chat through how she can connect with people.", "YTA studying abroad does not automatically mean she is supposed to have the issues she's having. It really sounds like you resent your sister for having this opportunity.", "Yeah, I can see why she's not speaking to you. Studying abroad comes with challenges. It's not just all shiny.

She's also a human being with feelings\n\nYtA", "YTA - your sister was vulnerable with you about struggles that she's facing in her personal life, and instead of listening with empathy, you \"shoulded\" all over her. \n\n\"I'm lonely\" - \"I'm struggling\" - \"I'm sad\" - \"I'm feeling ostracized because of my skin color\" \n\nAll of these vulnerable, heavy statements met with \"You made this decision, so you can't complain\". \n\nHow awful for your sister that she is not allowed to share her feelings with you without having them thrown back in her face. \n\nDid you ever think about telling her something as simple as \"We really miss you too, and I'm sorry you're feeling alone right now.

Your sister is alone and struggling with loneliness in a foreign country and you react like that? Jeeeeez man.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nShe's lonely and homesick, have some sympathy for her!

Did any of you or out through siblings ask to to study abroad and get shut down?\n\nYour sister thought she could call you for emotional support when she was struggling, \n and you told her otherwise", "YTA. Your sister is being racially abused and feeling burned out and you're like 'oh it's your own fault'??? \n\nAs for your sister, here are my suggestions:\n- join a bridge club, it's a chill and social society most unis have and there's often a lot of SE Asian and Chinese members as the sport is more popular in Asia than in Europe. \n- Manchester is super diverse, can she meet people outside of the university? I personally love a quiz night because somebody will want her on their team, or recommend something like Chapeltown Picturehouse where she can go alone and have a good time even if she doesn't get chatting. \n- she should keep a record of the bullying. Even if she chooses not to report it right now (I understand how it might feel scary to report something that would cause her problems if she's not successful) it will help her if it a) escalates or she b) needs receipts at any point in the future\n- can she do a weekly zoom social with her family and/or friends? To make her feel less isolated? Scheduled things have been good for me whilst I've been busy with my PG study because it's let my friends know when I need a bit of extra support.", "YTA.\n\nShe did choose to study abroad, and money isn\u2019t everything; I\u2019ll bet she\u2019d rather work than feel lonely. Loneliness is not just a small problem. You should understand that more than strangers on Reddit as her sister.\n\nYou might think life is easy for her as she\u2019s getting fees paid for but think again; are you just jealous of her, and not able to be happy for your sister?", "YTA. it sounds a little like you\u2019re blaming her for the racism she\u2019s experiencing, with the whole \u201cyou chose to study abroad so you have to suck it up\u201d mentality. she absolutely did not sign up to be targeted by her classmates. since when is that an inherent part of studying abroad? furthermore, you\u2019re her sister. you should be more supportive. i can 100% understand being envious of the support she receives from your parents but that\u2019s no excuse to turn your back on her when she is reaching out to you for help in a vulnerable time.", "YTA", "You couldn\u2019t have said something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a tough time\u2026.\u201d? \n\nYTA - what was the point of that? Is there some anger or resentment brewing here?", "Wow. No compassion, no sympathy, no support, no empathy, no recommendations. Just feed her to the wolves. Yikes. \n\nGreen does not look good on you.", "YTA. it is a common reaction for people studying abroad/moving abroad to feel lonely for the first couple of weeks. you should've talked about all the positives, remind her about her goals and all the benefits of studying abroad and try to shift her focus from the negatives. you should've supported her in general...", "YTA. You sound very jealous. Living abroad is hard. I am white, moved from a \u2018white\u2019 country to another \u2018white country\u2019. It\u2019s hard! I can\u2019t even imagine dealing with racism on top of all when I went through so much to \u2018fit in\u2019.

If you met her, however, you'd realise she was rude as hell and no one wanted to associate with her.\n\nIt's easy to blame things on her classmates and say it's racism. But I find it hard to believe that in a multicultural country such as the UK, she hasn't found a single person who wanted to talk to her.", "So she has been there over 3 years and has no local friends? LMAO she has only herself to blame. NTA she is probably insufferable if nobody wants to be around her", "Nta you did nothing wrong.  She is lonely and instead of trying to socialize she has decided every one at her school is racist. Not possible. There will always be a few racists no matter where she goes but not everyone. She is young and sound very immature. Try to support her and encourage her to join a few school groups. If she is friendly huge chance someone wil be friendly to her.

I know Brits are often stereotyped as being undemonstrative, but Manchester is usually known for being full of friendly people, and your sister was fine and happy for her first three years in Bath (which frankly, I'd expect to have worse levels of diversity), so it's clearly only this year - after she moved to a completely different part of the country without the friends she made during her undergrad degree - that something has gone wrong for your sister. \n\nAnd because this is an outlier year, it's really unhelpful telling her that she should be used to it!
