I personally love a quiz night because somebody will want her on their team, or recommend something like Chapeltown Picturehouse where she can go alone and have a good time even if she doesn't get chatting. \n- she should keep a record of the bullying. Even if she chooses not to report it right now (I understand how it might feel scary to report something that would cause her problems if she's not successful) it will help her if it a) escalates or she b) needs receipts at any point in the future\n- can she do a weekly zoom social with her family and/or friends?

Second, OP, no matter how informed one can be before making the decision to live abroad for however long, there is simply no way to fully prepare for the inevitable culture shock. It's exciting and fascinating but can also be lonely at times. And you don't realize what you took for granted until they're gone,  even small comforts like a familiar snack. A little compassion is in order here.", "There are student social activities and groups that she can join to meet people and become friends. I met an American going to London University who got a job in a pub to make some pocket money and meet people. I think you can get part-time employment with a student visa, but the rules may have changed.\n\nYou were actually really mean though. It is hard making new friends and meeting people when you move to a new locale. I don't blame her for not talking to you if you have no sympathy and empathy.", "YTA hard core.

I would say a gentle YTA, because I think OP genuinely doesn\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard for their sister. \n\nI say this as an Asian who grew up in Asia and studied abroad myself. Before I went, and in the first few years after I went, I had the same mindset as OP. My parents worked very hard to support my studying. I should be focusing on academics and doing well in school. I decided to study abroad, so it\u2019s my responsibility to acclimate and make friends in the new culture. \n\nIt took me years to realize that I wasn\u2019t happy. Studying abroad gave me a lot more opportunities than I would have had if I stayed where I was from, so I don\u2019t regret it and would do it again. But I couldn\u2019t get used to the food and weather. I don\u2019t quite enjoy the social activities (bars, parties etc.) that people from the culture abroad do frequently. My experiences and the things I care about just aren\u2019t the same as those of people around me. It\u2019s easy to say to focus on academics or just to acclimate, but a lot of cultural roots run deep and even if one tries, it is not easy.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t even get picked on due to my skin colour, so I imagine it\u2019s much harder for OP\u2019s sister. I can see why OP doesn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t before I went myself, and even then, it took me years to realize and admit it all. \n\nBut OP, I hope this helps you understand a bit more why it\u2019s hard for your sister. Please be kind to her. Even something like \u201cI can\u2019t claim to understand what you\u2019re going through, but I acknowledge it is difficult and if you want to talk, I am here to listen\u201d would mean a lot to her.", "No judgement but your sister has loads of ways of meeting people.

This hopefully ensures that your sister is less likely to make the same mistake, and that she knows she needs to take responsibility for the consequences of her current choice. You want her to grow from this experience.\n\nHer perspective: She has lived in a western country for a few of her formative adult years, and possibly adopted some western culture by osmosis despite only being friends with fellow POCs. She is genuinely lonely, and was seeking some western style affection when she answered your call.

The first year was lonely, depressing, and I would downright go for days without having a proper conversation that wasn't in a class or related to class work. I made friends later with similar intrests and started integrating in the second year. Sounds like she is specifically looking for other SEAs which I understand since a lot of Asian students abroad tend to stick together in bubbles but it is not healthy and her not making a decent effort to connect with people and playing the race card is pathetic. She needs to have an epiphany and understand that making friends means finding people with similar interests and being more social rather than reserved.\n\nYou pointed a part of the truth to her but are not being a helpful sibling but rather judgemental and almost sounding like you have a grudge or jealous that she got to study abroad with your parent's support.

I'm a minority here, too, to the point I get stared at doing simple things like grocery shopping because people aren't used to seeing a non-Japanese person where I live. A lot of the people I met when I moved here have since left, and my social network of people who share my culture is dwindling. \n\nIt isn't as simple as \"getting used to it\".

No two people experience the same thing in the same way, and maybe if you were in her shoes then her problems might not be as much of a struggle for you if at all, but that doesn't change the fact that she in her own experience IS struggling, and that it's very real to her. Everyone's feelings, struggles, and experiences matter and are valid no matter how big, small, or different they are, so your sister's feelings should matter to you BECAUSE they matter to her.\n\nOver the span of 4 years, circumstances can change, and what wasn't a problem before could eventually become one or vice versa. I hope you can try to understand the difficulty and loneliness in just being abroad and away from your family. Yes, it was her own choice, but that doesn't make it any less hard on her. Also on top of being in a new city, postgrad is significantly different from undergrad, so there's multiple things she's struggling to adjust too. Mental health is serious and it's more vulnerable in some people than others.\n\nPlease try to understand her. She's used to not leaning on or confiding in others because you and your family don't seem to try to understand and validate her. She tried to open up to you when she called which is great, but you coldly shut her out. \n\nI understand she should be living her own life and dealing with her own issues on her own, but she's your little sister, she should be allowed to vent and even whine whether it's about something big or trivial, and she deserves to be heard, accepted, embraced, because that's what family is for, right? Wouldn't you want your family to be somewhere you could return to even later on in life whenever you need help or comfort?\n\nI know you probably have a lot to do and deal with, what with the responsibilities you mentioned and all, but please have some compassion and empathy in your heart. Family is irreplaceable, so don't lose your sister or be the reason you two drift apart.

Everybody else is a lot more subtle, with the upper class making overt attempts to appear not racist by having more friends and acquaintances from an ethnic background. \n\nTo me it seems less a race thing and more a culture thing. Brits don't tend to make friends in the same way that Americans do and almost all social activity revolves purely around going to the pub. In fact most societies at university will have a pub crawl every term visiting at least 10 pubs in a night.\n\nI will say that OPs response is something only a complete AH would say and instead they should have been more sympathetic.
