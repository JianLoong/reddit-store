{"id": 15514, "submission_id": "12w87aq", "title": "AITA for lying about my weekend plans to avoid babysitting?", "selftext": "I (25F) recently (1 year ago) moved across the country to be closer to my brother, sister-in-law (40 M/F) and nephew (6M). Importantly, I said at the time that I would babysit once per week - I said this happily as I love hanging out with my nephew. We all agreed.\n\nI really like it here. A little too much. Instead of babysitting, I want to do other things - my past few weekends have been spent skiing, taking art classes, language exchanges, trail running groups, etc. I now have a lot of friends here that I love to pieces and want to catch up with regularly.\n\nMy brother lives about an hour outside of the city in the suburbs, and even babysitting for 2-3 hours eats up an entire afternoon/evening. They rarely bring him here as my babysitting time usually overlaps with his bedtime. I babysat weekly for my first month, and then switched to biweekly. This was fine, but I recently have been feeling like this is too frequent, especially as I sometimes need to work on weekends as well. I asked to change this frequency to monthly. \n\nInitially, my SIL said that a monthly visit is not good, as my nephew would like to see me more often. I thought I solved this problem by talking to him about it the last time I babysat - I said that I have a lot of stuff to do on weekends so will see him less, but still way more often than when I lived really far away. He understands weeks vs months, and has a calendar in his room, so I marked out when I would be babysitting. He understood. \n\nHowever, it seems the issue is that my brother and SIL really enjoyed the free babysitting, as they do not have money for babysitting and did not go anywhere without their son the first six years of his life.  We could not agree on a babysitting frequency, so I began to lie about my work schedule, saying that I have to work full days on Saturdays (I do not - a few hours if anything). They also know I go to church on Sundays so that time is restricted as well. With this lie in place, I am beginning to babysit only once per month.\n\nHonestly, I feel like a monster lying about my work schedule to get out of seeing my nephew, even though I enjoy hanging out with him. I did not know what my free time would look like over a year ago when I promised to work weekly.\n\nImportantly, when making the judgement, please remember that I know I have the \"right\" to lie babysit however often I want. The time is mine. This is not \"Do I Have the Right\", it is \"Am I The Asshole\". \n\nTLDR; AITA for saying I'm busier than I really am to avoid babysitting?", "created_utc": 1682255550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w87aq/aita_for_lying_about_my_weekend_plans_to_avoid/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their child isn't your responsibility. You're a great brother for agreeing to help them with childcare when you could spend time with your nephew without the obligation by visiting when they're home. You're an awesome uncle, and they're taking advantage of your love for your nephew to save a bit of money.", "NTA. Instead of lying about it, just stick to \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not available today to babysit\u201d and leave it at that. They aren\u2019t owed an explanation, or free childcare at the expense of your free time as someone who didn\u2019t pop out a baby.", "NTA. Your nephew is not _your_ child. It's not _your_ responsibility to babysit him. If you did try to speak to your brother and SIL and explain that you have your own life and they still insist you do that and you're afraid that speaking up will make them block you from your nephew then ig lying is the best choice\n\nEdit. Some spelling mistakes", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them babysitting. You\u2019ve been extremely generous to do that for them as long as you have but you also have a child free life that you get to live.", "NTA, they are using you. It\u2019s one thing for you to offer on friendly basis and it\u2019s another thing for them to demand a specific frequency or mandate it. It\u2019s not your obligation. I would strongly suggest that you have a conversation with them and explain that you have a busy schedule now that you have settled in so you won\u2019t be able to do a confirmed X/week or month babysitting session, you can help if there is a real emergency but other than that they need to make different arrangements.", "NTA. This is so common with people that have kids it's ridiculous. They suddenly lack free time because they decided to invest in something that lasts 18~23+ years depending on the country. Then get mad/realize that this investment isn't self sustaining and requires attention. Welcome to having children. Family isn't obligated to take care of your investment for you. Random strangers aren't obligated to either, which is why babysitting and daycare are PAID businesses (and don't get me started on how their \"perfect angel\" suddenly becomes a demon from another universe when not in their parents eyesight and get around other children, because we all know it's true, but that's a different topic).\n\nThey enjoyed the free babysitting, but now you have other things you wanna do. Unfortunate for them, but that's what they have to deal with now being parents. No money for a babysitter means they're taking the kid with them where they need to go. That's parenthood. Sometimes date nights only happen once a month but that's what they signed up for for the next 11~12ish years (until he's old enough to be left home alone at least), so they have to deal with it.", "NTA. I find free babysitting to be like Xmas presents. They happen once a year, and should be just grateful to get something under the tree, no matter what it is.\nIt\u2019s your time, do what you wish and they should be thankful for the time you freely invest on your nephew. Also at 6 he should have school friends and soon they ll find another family they can mutually dump kids on each other (this is what I fo with my oldest best friends, she is often here for sleepover when her parents go concerts or need a break and we do the same).", "NTA\n\nThey are trying to use you as free childcare. And they are trying to guilt you by saying \"oh, nephew misses you so much\" when you try to set boundaries. \n\nYour time is your own. It's great if you want to hang with nephew once a month and babysit for free. But you shouldn't feel guilted into doing it more often than you actually want to. They are not trapped in their house. If they want to go out, they can PAY for a babysitter.\n\nAlso, this nonsense about nephew misses you so much is a load of bull. If they REALLY wanted nephew to see you, they would be making an effort both ways, bringing him to you where you live half the time to experience fun things to do close to where YOU live. But that's not what they're doing, is it? Nope, it's always you drive to them because it's not about you \"spending time with nephew\" it's about *you being used as a free babysitter*. Don't let them do this. Set boundaries.", "NTA, but I think a serious conversation about boundaries is necessary to keep you not the asshole, because while I do think you\u2019re getting trampled on, I don\u2019t think lying is the way out of it. Especially if you want to come out of this with a healthy relationship with your family. If you feel like a calm, empathetic conversation won\u2019t be possible, I\u2019d recommend a mediator (not another family member). Good luck!", "NTA. You do not have an obligation to keep to a specific babysitting schedule. It sounds like your SIL could use reminding of that. You have your own life, and while it's clear you love your nephew, you do not need to be bound or guilted into babysitting for free when that's disruptive for you.  I get lying to get out of it is the easiest way to handle it, and it doesn't harm anyone in doing so. With that said, it might be beneficial to talk to your brother/SIL about the babysitting situation so you're all on the same page regarding expectations.", "Changing your mind is allowed. N T A for not babysitting on demand but you shouldn't lie about it, just tell the truth - you didn't realise how much fun your new life was going to be and your priorities have changed. That's not what they want from you so they won't be happy, but they're not in charge of you. YTA for lying about it, yes.", "NTA  From what you've said your brother lives about an hour from you? That's a lot driving weekly. Maybe you could babysit every other week and take turns with the driving - or your brother and,SIL could make plans to go out in your area.", "NTA\nYou impulsively promised too much of your time when you saw an unknown work schedule, your move, and the opportunity to see your family more frequently. Now that you're getting more established in your own independent adult lifestyle and routine, weekly babysitting isn't convenient for you any more. Situations change. It's okay to change a boundary that no longer works for you. How much of your time and energy you give away is THE place for healthy boundaries.\n\nLet your bro and SIL know you can't promise regular free babysitting any more. Was there any agreement that you would babysit in return for some favor or support from them? If so, deciding when you've given enough time to \"pay it back\" might be a discussion. You have YOUR life and YOUR priorities to tend to. \n\nYou do not owe them a detailed explanation. Don't give them reasons to target and devalue. It's not your job to provide regular free time to parents. It's not going to damage your nephew for you to be a single young asult who visits occasionally. Give them boundaries. \"I can't come over regularly like I used to before I was more settled in here.\"  You could, but don't have to, offer a date night babysitting once a month.\n\nYou have the right to plan your limited time and energy to best meet your needs. Your needs for self care, rest and recharging, and other priorities outside of work are valid needs. The lying us unnecessary and only clouds the issue. You used to have plenty of time for free babysitting. You no longer do.", "NTA\n\nYou overpromised, and when you realized you tried to amend it. \n\nLegally speaking, there is no \u201ccontract\u201d here. You aren\u2019t getting anything for babysitting. You\u2019re doing them a favor, which you are under no obligation to continue doing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine to have other plans. THey are the AHs for making you feel you need to lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce per month is already very generous.", "NTA", "NTA. A diplomatic lie is acceptable now and then. However I do think you are going to have to sit down with them sooner or later and explain how things have changed.....", "NTA -  as long as you give them notice.", "ESH. That was a big commitment to make. But, at the end of the day life changes. Surely they don't expect this arrangement to last forever. At the end of the day their child is not your responsibility. And you are not obligated to give them free babysitting for the rest of your life. \n\nYou also messed up by communicating with the child and not the parents. Your SIL is wrong to use your nephew wanting to see you to guilt you into babysitting more.\n\nHave a conversation with them. My life has changed since I've been here. I have more friends now. And a social life I didn't expect. I will babysit 1 or 2 (up to you) times a month. But it needs to be arranged ahead of time. They can take it or leave it.", "You aren't responsible for their child and ultimately the only thing you did wrong was lie to avoid the confrontation that will only be worse if they find out. They need to respect your time. You are going out of the way for them, they shouldn't just expect it.", "NAH,  But keep your weekends free to yourself and give them mid-week options, or let them know that the babysitting thing is not working out anymore because you are building your life in the city.", "YTA for lying in my personal opinion. However NTA for not wanting to babysit, especially for free. Just be honest though...ESH really...I can't stand people who lie. You have every right to set boundaries and dictate how your time is spent, but why put yourself in a position where you feel guilty and secretive rather than juat setting boundaries and living freely? Also your brother and SIL should at least compensate you in some way for your time rather than expecting free labor.", "YTA for needlessly lying.  You don't need an excuse.  All you need to do is say \"That doesn't work for me\" and refuse to elaborate.  Just repeat \"That doesn't work for me\" as many times as necessary if the try to press you.  It is truly none of their business *why* it doesn't work for you.", "YTA. For continuing to lie to them. You made a promise you don\u2019t want to keep. Tell them all the truth.", "YTA - though a very soft AH. I get why you did it, because they don't want to take, \"no\" for an answer. You're right in that you are free to do what you want with your time. It's always best to be honest, regardless. It gives them a chance to process their real feelings of anger and disappointment. You take that away from them when you make up an excuse. And they do have the right to feel angry and disappointed with you, because you were initially really excited and gave them a great offer. Your lying is to protect your own feelings of guilt. If you want to choose another thing to do with your time, own it and don't feel guilty. You love your nephew and spending time with him, so you don't have to defend your time management to them. You have a right to have your own life, and they'll have to learn to accept that.\n\nMaybe work something out with them that they can be happy with as well. You could take your nephew to your place for an overnight on one night a month to make it extra special. Or tell your bro and SIL that if they bring your nephew to your place, you'll take him for the afternoon on an extra day. Invite them to go to church with you then take your nephew to lunch while the parents go shopping or something. Just show an effort to fit them in where you are offering time without ruining your social life.", "YTA for lying. Don't cave into pressure, stay honest, and explain your side. They can disagree but they don't control you. Live you life.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nTo be clear, you're not at all an AH for not wanting to babysit as often anymore!! Life changes over time, and it's completely reasonable that agreements like the one you made when you moved there should be flexible and change over time as well. It would be ridiculous for them to assume that you were going to babysit biweekly for the rest of your nephew's childhood. While I genuinely feel for them (several parents that I love are in similar positions and I know that it's incredibly difficult on their mental health not to be able to have time to themselves and away from the kids to recharge and focus on their own relationships), and I feel for your nephew (as an auntie I know my own niblings look forward to every moment spent together), their needs are only half of the equation here, and yours are not less important. \n\nHowever, none of that was the question you put to us, and you didn't ask us to pass judgement about you babysitting or not. You asked us to judge whether you are an AH for LYING TO THEM about it. And yeah, you are. The lying is not only unnecessary, it's really poor judgement on your part. At some point they're going to find out, guaranteed, and it's going to hurt them (and your relationship with them) way more than just telling them the truth.\n\nStop lying. Being sneaky and deceitful with people you love is never the answer. Just sit down with them and be honest. Tell them that you love spending time with your nephew and being able to help them out, but your circumstances have changed since you've moved there, and you are finding that you need more time to pursue your own interests and social life. Perhaps this is the time to see if you can find a happy medium: offer an occasional afternoon of babysitting at your place, even if it's not the ideal for them, to give them some semblance of a break. \n\nBut yeah . . . while you're N-T-A for your needs, lying to them is definitely an AH move.", "YTA for lying and YTA for not really trying to honour the commitment you made. Maybe take your nephew to church with you if you enjoy hanging out with him, that would be multi tasking and honouring commitments, it would maybe be an opportunity to do something with him afterwards...", "I'm sorry.  YTA\n\nYou don't make promises to little kids and let them get attached, then ditch them for something \"better\" when it comes along.  They're tiny little people.  They get when they aren't a priority to you, even when they don't have the words to express it.  You are clearly a priority to him. He is now very aware that he is just an option to you.

It doesn\u2019t make them greedy or selfish for asking for help. They\u2019re thinking of their child (and yes, spending time away from your children is important for the parents relationship, which enables kids to be raised in a happy home). Your nephew will notice you not being around as much. I\u2019m not sure if you explicitly told your nephew that you were going to be around weekly, but it\u2019s not good to set expectations for a kid and then fail to meet them.
