Your Father is being incredibly selfish and denying your sisters a chance to spend the day with him.", "NTA. As a former neglected child, there's nothing I appreciated more than relatives stepping in for me and going as far as getting rash. It happened very rarely but it was what helped me to get perspective and validation because when all the adults around you act as if a bad behavior is ok, you start questioning yourself and then convincing yourself that being mistreated is normal.\nSo yes of course taking back a gift and snapping at someone is a bad act itself, but this time it was not only deserved but also useful for your sisters' emotions", "Info:  What did your sisters think about what you did? \n\n\nTruthfully it means nothing what we think, you being an assholes all depends on what they think. Because it's not about your dad it's about you stepping in and making a decision and speaking for them.", "NTA that man is not acting like father so he doesn\u2019t need a Father\u2019s Day gift.

Maybe leaving the gift would have sent a better message, though. He would then have only associated negative feelings toward it and it would be a reminder of how messed up he is.\n\nBut, he doesn't deserve a gift. Not a father at all.

My 16 year old sister however was made from the moment that he had said the thing about the party and started to cry, she said that she was done trying to make a relationship with him and ended up giving the gift to our brother", "Take him to court for child support. Maybe you can get payments from when you got custody. It could help if your sisters want to go to college.", "Definitely sue him", "NTA but if you do not take him back to court to sue for child support then you\u2019re the asshole.

You and your brother are fierce advocates for your sisters. In California if you go for child support the courts will take your father and stepmother\u2019s income into account.

Please get started on this right away because it can take time to complete the process. In the meantime, block your father and stepmother from contacting you. Tell your Aunt that you will gladly return the Father\u2019s Day gift when he starts earning it by acting like a father and until then, your brother will continue to receive the accolades and gifts for fulfilling the role!

You can always put the money into a savings account for their college fund or the like.", "The mother should pay child support as well; even if she can't pay yet, she still owes it. My Father disappeared for 20 yrs but all that child support debt accrued in his absence. I was an adult when those payments finally began. It is now another 20 yrs later and the total due is finally paid. My mom didn't need the money by then so she used it for family vacations. My half-sister (same Father) was in college when her Mom died and those child support payments started going to my half-sister. She desperately needed that money and it helped her pay for college. My point is, even if YOU don't need the money right now, your siblings may truly need it in the future. Regardless, it is owed.", "NTA, you're protecting your siblings", "NTA.\n\nConcerning all the comments mentioning Child Support, check with your state.

Some part of him must know he's failed as a father, and you are actually playing the \"dad\" role.
