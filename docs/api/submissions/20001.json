All while we barely have heard from my mom(still don\u2019t know where she is), and although we live 3 minutes by car now away from our dad in a better house than we did before, he still doesn\u2019t make effort to call/see my two younger siblings. My brother and I are over trying to have either of our parents in our lives, but I know my sisters really miss them sometimes and unless I call to invite my dad over to our house/award ceremonies/ recitals, he doesn\u2019t even care to ask, but he does give my sisters money when they ask for it.

Snatched a gift that my sister got for our back from my dad after he didn\u2019t invite my younger siblings to his Father\u2019s Day party. 2.

How do you tolerate him without completly loosing it?", "NTA sorry that your dad is a deadbeat but that's what he is. He doesn't really care about you or your siblings. If he did he would be reaching out about important life events and stuff (at minimum).", "NTA he\u2019s not a real father just a sperm donor.", "NTA. Your Father is being incredibly selfish and denying your sisters a chance to spend the day with him.", "NTA. As a former neglected child, there's nothing I appreciated more than relatives stepping in for me and going as far as getting rash. It happened very rarely but it was what helped me to get perspective and validation because when all the adults around you act as if a bad behavior is ok, you start questioning yourself and then convincing yourself that being mistreated is normal.\nSo yes of course taking back a gift and snapping at someone is a bad act itself, but this time it was not only deserved but also useful for your sisters' emotions", "Info:  What did your sisters think about what you did? \n\n\nTruthfully it means nothing what we think, you being an assholes all depends on what they think. Because it's not about your dad it's about you stepping in and making a decision and speaking for them.", "NTA that man is not acting like father so he doesn\u2019t need a Father\u2019s Day gift. How weird to want to celebrate Father\u2019s Day with your friends instead if your actual children", "Obviously your \u201cdad\u201d is utter shite! nta. I just want to commend you on stepping up for your siblings, and at such an early age as well. \n\nI hope everything good for you and your family, and I hope your sorry excuse of a sperm donor gets hit with the biggest karma the universe has to offer!", "NTA. Maybe leaving the gift would have sent a better message, though. He would then have only associated negative feelings toward it and it would be a reminder of how messed up he is.\n\nBut, he doesn't deserve a gift. Not a father at all. Standing up for yourself & sisters was probably setting a good example for them.", "I mean technically yta (because taking back a gift is bad) but he seems to have been an awful father and I don't blame you one bit.
