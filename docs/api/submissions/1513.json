I work for a small company that caters to customers' orders through phone and email. Many of us, including me, are able to work from home.\nI NEEDED this job due to circumstances with my daughter's after school. Working from home was the only solution at the time and I think I'm incredibly lucky to have found this job when I did.\nRecently, we received two new coworkers. We were stoked because the night crew really needed more help. We were overworked, tired, and a few were (maybe still are) planning to quit. One was being trained by the same person as me, let's call them Book, and the other was trained by someone from a different team entirely, we'll call them Brat. They're a couple in their 30s.  We know that they are from a religious cult that one of the higher ups are in and got the job off of his recommendation.  We didn't want to scream \"Nepotism\", but it became obvious when the higher up wanted to bring Brat in at a higher rate than anyone else because he had to drive to get to the office. (Most of the staff have to drive and Brat is also currently working from home)\nBook's work plummeted and odd behavior started to happen. Emails sent when neither of them were supposed to be on the clock, mainly Brat (this is illegal in my state). Came in hours before their shift to put their tags on the easiest orders. Huge problems in customer's orders that caused a lot of returns and extra work for everyone. They don't email, call, or message anyone so we're all left picking up the pieces. Mainly me and coworker, Toro. I've had to stay hours past my shift going into their work and fixing things that were day 1 lessons. I had numerous talks with the manager because now it's affecting my health. \nTheir disregard for the schedule has caused us to scramble in certain areas and their mistakes and refusal to fix them has caused stress and extra work. I decided enough was enough and started messaging them directly. This was done to me many times when I first started and led to a lot of growth on my end. Brat started questioning why I was being \"unprofessional\" and talking about their hours despite the way it's hurting everyone being outlined for them. Emails that I would be working would disappear only to turn up in the archive or deleted folder. They would say they knew their schedule and, in the same text, give the wrong hours. If one of them is told that their shift is up, then both of them will leave, despite their shifts being different.\nToro and the trainer, Kam, who taught Book and myself, and both of the team managers agree that I haven't done anything wrong. Toro and Kam say I shouldn't be staying as late as I am cleaning up after them. I should just put Book or Brat's tag on it and leave it in the box.\nI'm not their boss. I'm just tired and this job isn't the best and now I have to constantly fix orders each night because if not all the work won't be ready for the morning crew.

I don't have a choice in the matter. If I clock out before it's done then that leaves a mountain of work for the morning and leaves the driver's without knowing where they're even going. The cult information is more about how we've been asking to receive help for a long time but didn't receive anyone with any skill or want for the job, just because they were in the same organization.\nI was also told that confronting them was the right thing to do since I was given the same direction when I first started from management and co-workers.", "Honestly? I should but I also feel bad about it. The products we give are essential to the businesses that order them and if I leave it then they might not even get it or get the completely wrong items. We've already had issues where a business had to delay their whole opening just because of a bad shipment. I don't think it's fair that someone else has to pay for something I can do myself.", "Sounds like the drivers not knowing where to go is not your problem. They can take it up with management.", "  You are kind of TA. Well either do what you were told and tag the people who were supposed to do it, or if you don\u2019t want to, then feel free to do the extra work but realize that\u2019s YOUR CHOICE so stop complaining about it. If you don\u2019t want  t the extra work at the end you don\u2019t have to do it.", "I get what you're saying but that's literally part of my job. I manage on Friday and Saturday nights and get all the information out to all of operations, customer service, and orders. I know the post needs more info but it cut me off at 3,000 characters \ud83d\ude05  It's a small company and I've been there long enough that a lot of end of night responsibilities have been placed on me.", "That's a good point. I was just given the \"just tag it\" advice today. So maybe I'll just have to nut up and do that from now on. It wouldn't apply to every order and mistake, unfortunately, because some things need to get done for the morning crew and the delivery drivers especially but it might lessen the load a bit.", "Hope you're getting overtime at least \ud83d\ude09", "Nut up?? I haven\u2019t heard that before, it\u2019s pretty crass.\ud83d\ude33", "I appreciate that. If I wasn't I think I'd just start crying \ud83d\ude02", "I'm sorry \ud83d\ude05 It's was a pretty popular thing to say when I was kid with my friends and stuff. Old habits die hard. I am really sorry if it made you uncomfortable though."]}
