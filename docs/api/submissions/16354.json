Not OK\n\nNTA", "Um, no, NTA. \n\nShe got scared cuz she **knew** she was doing something she wasn\u2019t supposed to, and she\u2019s gaslighting you saying it\u2019s cuz you yelled. She knew better than to try and force an animal\u2019s face into food.", "NTA. Don't let anyone abuse your kitty.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is, though, especially for trying to force your cat to eat the puppy food. She should have gone out and got Rodeo his food immediately. If she's that comfortable forcing someone else's companion to eat, she probably doesn't treat her puppy any better. Plus, dog and cat food are not interchangeable; cats have specific dietary needs that dog food won't provide.", "Nta, she\u2019s throwing a tantrum and trying to make you think you are in the wrong because she knows she messed up badly and is afraid you will call her out on it. You better stand up for your old cat, because your the only guardian they\u2019ve got to do it for them", "NTA, she should've taken her ass out and gotten you more cat food. Don't mess with other people's pets.", "Definitely NTA! Who brings their puppy over without warning? That's flipping weird to me. I'd consider that alone a reason for her to be TA because that's so rude! But since she just let her puppy eat the cat's food, that's not cool, seeing as it could easily be prevented by letting you know! Then she fed the cat the kibble when you told her NO! She disrespected your boundaries! What other boundaries is she going to cross? That's what I would wonder. I know you love her, but you deserve someone who will respect your boundaries. And it's awful that she would scold your cat for not eating puppy kibble when it has a medical reason not to! Let alone force its face into the kibble! She acts like she's 16 not 21! Do you really want to date someone who acts like they still need a babysitter?", "NTA.", "NTA - That was a natural visceral reaction... same as if you were to see someone doing this to your child. Probably would've done the same thing.\n\nYou and your (ex)girlfriend will never see each other the same. Not sure where your relationship will go, but know that you did right by your cat. He was there before her and is by your side now.  :)", "Yeah narrowly NTA\n\nRight up until she grabbed the cat's neck you were kinda losing your cool over a dumb mistake that she clearly didn't know how to fix. But responding with violence to an uncooperative animal is beyond disturbing, I'm honestly a little worried for that puppy she has.", "NTA she had no business putting her hands on the cat", "NTA. Find another gf.", "What?! Why are you questioning if you are. You are NTA here but she is. I\u2019m assuming she knew that Rodeo could only have wet food because of his dental problems from old age. The fact that she asked you about giving him kibble, you saying no, then her doing it anyways PLUS holding that old cats head down is a huge issue. That right there tells me she doesn\u2019t respect you and who treats an animal like that?! There are plenty of others in the sea that won\u2019t act like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's so much wrong with her behaviour towards the animals here .... For a start, when introducing animals to each other it should be planned, controlled and on a neutral environment. Her bringing her dog unannounced, letting him off leash immediately and not stopping him when he misbehaved is so wrong. Holding an animal forcefully, trying to make him eat food that isn't even meant for his consumption in the first place is mildly abusive. Okay, maybe not mildly. You're not an asshole for protecting your cat, in HIS HOME, his safe space.

If you deviate from the rules about his food, treats or meds, you are not only dead to me, i WILL send you the emergency vet bill. If you don't pay I WILL get a lawyer involved.
