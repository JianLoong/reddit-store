{"id": 12557, "submission_id": "11u85g9", "title": "AITA for yelling at my little brothers for their actions towards my dad's new girlfriend?", "selftext": "I (m19) am the oldest son in my family and I have two brothers: (m13) and (m11) respectively. With this context in mind let me get into this story:\n\nMy mother (who was always an awful awful person) divorced my father (m42) when I was 9 (and my brothers were 5 and 3 respectively), and left my father to go marry a musician in Texas. In the divorce proceeding my mother, supported by her new boyfriend, was more than willing to give over full custody of my brothers and I to my dad.\n\nNevertheless, since the divorce nearly a decade ago, my father raised us all on his own (maybe with some help from my grandparents). He is an amazing dad and he never made us feel like we needed anything. That being said, during that period of giving us the life we deserved, he put his own personal-life on hold. For close to 8 years my father hadn't gone on so much as a date or anything. He has moved on, but I think the divorce and the infidelity damaged a very core part of him which he sometimes still struggles with, although he'll never admit/say that.\n\nWith this in mind, after nearly a year of convincing, I managed to push my father to go on a date with a friend of mine's mother (who herself was a widow). They hit it off and they have been together for almost two years now. The issue is, since my dad introduced her to my brothers some 6 months ago they have made her life hell. They say she is trying to replace our mom (who was already an awful person but they were too young to know that). She is trying really hard to connect with them as she is constantly trying to win them over with gifts and fun plans. Clearly she is struggling.\n\nI am posting this because a few days ago, I came back home from college to just check-in with my family. What I saw was just awful, my brothers were refusing to eat food she had made (because she had made it) to literally refusing to even recognize her existence. The sweet lady she is, she goes along with it and continues to try, but the other day when I went downstairs to get a bike-pump, I saw my dad trying to console her as she was crying about how my brothers hate her.\n\nAt this point, I got super angry. Took both of my brothers into a room and just yelled at them both. Both of them, since then, have become super quiet and perhaps fearing my anger, eat what is given to them, do as they are told and have, perhaps begrudgingly, begun listening to her.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend says that this was not the right decision. She said I should have let my dad handle it and all I did was make them hate her more. That wasn't my intention. With this in mind, AITA?\n\n**1ST EDIT:** I do want to clarify that, after I yelled at them, I talked to my dad. He has tried to talk with them but to no avail. You have to go easy on my dad here. From his perspective he can't be too hard on them as he is the only parent they have to lean on. Despite this, he is constantly trying to sit down and talk with them about it.\n\n**2ND EDIT:** I want to just say a few things. The person most opposed to her is actually my youngest brother, which makes sense as he is the only one of us who remembers our mother fondly. I get not wanting to replace your parent, but gosh darn it I wish I had her as a mom. She's so sweet, she's  trying to impress them by making them stuff they like. She's constantly going out of her way to help them with their work. Maybe its me projecting, but I went through my teenage years without my mom. I know how hard it was because I was there. She can be that for them, and I don't think they understand just how much that means. Furthermore, she is trying to meet them where they are at and I just don't know what I can do to try and get them to at least give her an opportunity.\n\nShe's also not trying to be their mother, she's just trying to help them as much as she can and that's because we can't help as much anymore (my grandparents are getting old, and I am in a college that is 6 hours away).", "created_utc": 1679096819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11u85g9/aita_for_yelling_at_my_little_brothers_for_their/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't a parent. You are their brother. However, sometimes it's that very thing that will sway the opinion of siblings in this type of situation. \n\nIf your brothers didn't give reasons to hate her (she does nasty stuff when no one sees it, etc.) Then they deserved something for being little snots.\n\nI do advise sitting down and actually talking to them about all of it calmly at least once before you leave again. It will probably make them, and you, feel better about the situation.", "Because your dad was handling it well so far? NO!!!! What you did was perfect! I know they look up to you and because of that they're going to listen to you more than they're going to listen to him or her! See, the way they're thinking is that Dad's the authority but it's his girlfriend so of course he's going to stick up for her. She's the girlfriend so of course she's going want them to act nice to her. But you saying these things, that's a whole new level to them! That's going to make them sit up and take notice if nothing else does!\n\nYou are NTA and you may have really made this whole situation turn a corner here! Good job big brother!", "NTA \n\nAnd not a bad idea. \n\nOften kids will listen to an older sibling way more than they would listen to a parent. \n\nYour next step is to sit them down and EXPLAIN where your anger came from and why you think they should actually give her a chance. \n\nMaybe explain that you saw your Mum break your Dads heart and that he has worked hard for a decade to raise you all peacefully and that he deserves some happiness. Take the anger and guilt out of the conversation and really talk to them. That will go a long way to help fix the situation.", "NTA\n\nSometimes brothers need to deal with brothers without getting parents involved.", "NAH- the kids may seem like the assholes but what they really need is to understand that their father deserves companionship, and that having more people in your life that care about you is a good thing. \nThey don\u2019t have to call her mom or think of her as a mom, but they have to learn peaceful coexistence.", "NTA. Your brothers were too young to understand the reality of the situation with your mother and it seems your father has taken the high road and not criticized her. IMHO, you did exactly the right thing as only a respected big brother could. I hope it's a turning point for everyone.", ">I might be the asshole as I have made the situation much worse\n\n\n\nHow did you make it worse? It sounds like your actions helped. Maybe you should have spoken normally rather than yell, but that doesn't make you an ah. NTA", "NTA. Sometimes it\u2019s the older siblings job to let the younger siblings know when they eff up. A soft kick in the butt because sometimes they take it better from the older sibling who is closer to them in age and maybe views. Maybe just straight up yelling could have been replaced with firm concise language but you can revisit this convo with them. Do they remember your mom? Are they still in contact with her? Do they know what she did to you all and your dad? Are they scared of your dad being in a relationship for any reason whatsoever? Has your father tried putting them in therapy to route out the problem?", "NTA. I think you did the right thing as their brother. They needed to hear that their behaviour was horrible. They are resisting change in their lives, and I think that is pretty normal for kids their age. But that doesn't make being AHs OK.", "NTA! You are a good older sibling who looks after not just their siblings, but parent and family unit as well. It seems like your siblings trust you a lot. You should sit down with them, apologize for yelling, and talk them through everything. Why it isn't okay to shun their dad's girlfriend like that, how much he has sacrificed for them, and how to move forward. Good luck!", "NTA. Now that you have them an earful maybe the next step is to speak with them, get therapy. But sounds like hearing it from you might have been what they needed because they probably assumed you'd feel the same way. \n\nI would also talk to your dad at this point. He might have already tried with them but having one on one talks with them about their feelings is also a good next step. They don't need to love your stepmom but they need to treat her with the same civility and kindness she has been giving them. They also need to understand she's not trying to replace your mom. Mom chose to leave but stepmom is not a replacement. They probably still feel loyal to her and those friends are hard to untangle at that age.", "NTA\n\nSiblings keep us honest. They can say things parents can't. Keep reminding them dad deserves happiness, too.", "NTA\n\nYou meant well OP. You really did.\n\nSeems like your siblings are struggling to understand how their father is also in need of companionship. I'd try to explain to them why their father is doing that and asking them to try giving her a chance.", "NTA - But you should apologize for screaming and explain the truth about your mother", "NTA. I think your brothers needed to hear your perspective and learn to be better from it.", "NTA. They need to show respect. She needs to back it down. She's trying too hard to be a mother figure. It's something they haven't had and don't want. Do it over starting as friends.", "Pretty clear NTA", "NTA, you didn't act like a parent, you acted like a big brother. Your dad has to show the boys that they will always be first in his heart, so someone has to tell them that they are being right little shits.", "NTA. Although maybe apologize for yelling at them, explain why what they were doing is wrong, and then give them the details of why your mom isn\u2019t around. I\u2019m pretty sure the tune will change once they here she just up and dropped them.", "NTA\n\nThis is something that needed to come from you, not your dad. They need to be told by a peer that their behaviour was wrong. You\u2019re GF isn\u2019t an AH either but she is a bit dense for not being able to see that. \nYour dad talking to them obviously wasn\u2019t going to work because they think he doesn\u2019t understand them, they can\u2019t say the same for you.", "NTA \n\nYou did a fine job of being a big brother, and a good son.\n\nSounds to me like your dad deserves some happiness and your brothers were doing their best to prevent that. Sometimes they need a good talking to. But also take the time to listen to them, maybe there\u2019s something else behind the scenes.", "NTA, and anyone that says otherwise must not have had siblings. If siblings can't yell at each other when someone's being an AH then no one can.", "I wouldn't say AH, but bad idea. First, you don't know what goes on when you aren't home. Second, you can't assume the boys feel the same way about your mother they do. They may need counseling. Third, it is your father's job to tell them what to do, not yours. You overstepped. This is not your place, and she is right. Once you are gone, they will get worse. They know their actions are getting a response now.", "Your dad should have handled it. He didn't. You did a good thing. NTA.", "NTA.  As older brother you should be a role model for the younger sibs and call them out when they're being little beasts.  My brother did this for me, and I'm glad he did.  You're doing good work here mister.", "NTA. Sometimes, kids need to hear things from their siblings/peers.", "Oh wow. This is hard. So, it really isn't your place to be a parent. Your dad needs to fill the role  you were filling, but I don't blame you.\n\nI have such a hard time calling your brothers AHs in this case. They were acting like it, but this is an insanely hard adjustment in a time that is already difficult for most kids. Life is already changing all around them, and now there's a new element that is taking dad's attention from them.\n\nOof. NAH because I really just feel bad for everyone involved. The only one I would call the AH is possibly your dad, but I don't know enough of the story.", "You did what was needed but you're girlfriend is unfortunately right. Your father is the one that should have been the one to do this. You need to sit down and have a talk with your dad on what happened and tell him that he needs to have a talk with your brothers as well... maybe even a family meeting with all of you together (without the girlfriend) and you can apologize to your brothers for yelling but tell them where you are coming from calmly. That dad put his life on hold and he has every right to be happy with a new person without them making person he choose feel like shit. Ask where they are coming from as well and why they feel the need to bully this new woman in their life.\n\nYou seem like a good guy so your dad raised you right, so your brothers should see reason on how their behavior is unacceptable.", "Your GF is absolutely wrong. Your brothers are the AH. Good for you for stepping up and doing the right thing. And I'd be giving my GF and second look for not supporting what you did. Your brothers were bullying your dad's GF, who sounds like she's trying. They deserve more than a scold.", "Yelling at children from a place of anger is never the play, my dude. It's not good parenting, and also you're not even their parent. YTA.", "NTA", "NTA at all. That\u2019s called being a good big brother.
