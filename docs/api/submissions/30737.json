I live right by the beach and parking is a problem. I have a garage so it doesn't affect me whatsoever. \n\nPart of our agreement is that we have to be physically there when we exchange custody. So I can't just send him out on his own or watch him on Ring to go to his mom. Normally this isn't a problem.\n\nYesterday my ex came to pick Cody up and she called to say she was running late because she couldn't find parking. I said okay. 10 minutes later she calls me to ask if she could park in my garage instead of trying to parking that isn't there. I said no. My reason is that we had just fought over money. I was paying her child support until she got a new job and is making way more than me. I took her to court to reevaluate child support so now she pays me. I ended remodeling my garage and getting a new washer and dryer. I knew she would start an argument about how I'm spending \"her\" on new stuff when in reality I needed to remodeling my garage and needed a new washer and dryer. It just wasn't worth it.\n\nThat made mad. She ended up coming to my porch and I walked my son to her. I apologized for not letting her use my garage and made up an excuse how there wasn't room. \n\nToday she texted me an $80 parking ticket she got for parking in the red zone by my house. She asked me to pay it because she couldn't find parking and I'm just as responsible for the custody exchange as she is. She said that it would only be fair seeing how she has to come to my house. \n\nI told her I need to not be responsible for everything. I go through a lot of bullshit with this coparenting thing and I just deal with it and that's what she should do. She then asked me to pay half and I said you literally make $175,000 a year. You can afford to pay an $80 ticket. She said it wasn't about the money but about the principle. I asked would she pay my parking ticket under similar circumstances? All of a sudden she stopped asking about the ticket and said she was disappointed in me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
