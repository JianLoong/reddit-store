I am in my 30s now. We had an invasive/annoying pastor that made snarky remarks, and had the social intelligence of a gnat. You are not wrong. Your parents probably went nuclear because they might be embarrassed and care what this pastor thinks. I have no doubt later on down the road they will understand your reaction. But seriously, what the hell is wrong with people like this? It\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s rude and entitlement at its finest. The good news is, when you eventually have your own place, you won\u2019t have to deal with bullshit like this.", "NTA\n\nThere's a difference between being grateful and being submissive.

I presume this is your parents home so you don't really have the right to say that they cannot have him as a visitor. However, you are an adult and you have no obligation to have anything to do with sucky, slimy people like this. Tell him to his face that you want nothing further to do with him and you will not sit and listen to him ever again. Leave the room and seriously consider telling your parents to put an f'ing sock in it the next time they tell you to apologize. Don't cook for him, refuse to see or speak to him. If your parents give you grief when he's there, leave the house. You really need to start looking at how to get into your own place because this is not going to end up anywhere good. The next thing you know, they're going to drag you into that church and force you through some  sort of conversion to make this clown happy.

Stealing is all that kind of slime cares about.", "NTA, you told him how you felt about him just showing up whenever he wants to and is always doing things to creep you out.

You should think carefully before you say things or don't and deal with the consequences.", "YTA, if you're so uncomfortable then move out and go NC", "NTA.

But he is showing absolutely no respect for you. Helping someone does not make him entitled to show up whenever he wants and judge you or try to convert you.

I feel like I may be able to offer some insight here.\n\nBased on what info you've provided us, I'm going to say that there are NAH.  Most likely, what you're dealing with here is more due, at least in part, to a gap in generational perspectives and expectations as it pertains to how pastors operate.\n\nThe practice of unannounced visitation by pastors was not just accepted in the generations just prior to this one, it was largely expected of pastors.  If a pastor didn't do this, it was perceived that he/she wasn't doing his/her job.  It's a thought that still persists, to an extent, among both pastors and churchgoers.\n\nIn today's world, however, dropping by someone's place, especially unannounced, is becoming more and more taboo--a viewpoint I totally understand and even agree with.\n\nIt's entirely likely that visitation such as this is the regular practice of this pastor.  If it is, it's entirely reasonable to suspect that it's also something that's expected of him by his congregation.\n\nAs for gifting your family a Bible and inviting you to church, think about it in context.  He helped you get into your home.   No one just assists in buying a home for someone they're indifferent toward, or even just like a little bit.  It's clear that he cares about your family a great deal.  As such, he cares for your immortal souls--and, if he believes that Jesus meant what he said when he said that \"No one comes to the Father (God) except through me,\" then it stands to reason that he would want a family he cares about to embrace this truth, as well.\n\nI understand the awkwardness that this can present for people of different religious beliefs, especially if said religion believes that there are multiple valid ways to God, and that generally leads people to say, \"don't try to convert me!\"\n\nI actually like Penn Jillette's viewpoint on this matter, as an admitted atheist.  He said:\n\n*\"If you believe there is a heaven and hell, and people could be going to hell or not getting eternal life or whatever, and you think it\u2019s not really worth telling them this because it would make it socially awkward--\"*\n\n*\u201cHow much do you have to hate somebody to not proselytize?
