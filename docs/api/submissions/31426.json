What does \"we were helped\" mean in this context.  Did this dude give your family money, does the church own this house and you are getting a very cheap rent,  or is it just this pastor guy knew the realtor and put you in contact,  or something else?  \n\nThis is all to say, are your parents putting up with his frequent visits because they are especially beholden to this guy and fear to be otherwise homeless if he isn't allowed to proselytize on a regular basis?  \n\nAside from that, sounds like you need to have a little convo with your parents and ask them what gives?", "This story has more holes than Swiss cheese \ud83e\uddc0 \ud83d\ude33", "Protestant pastors don\u2019t do mass", "NAH. It sounds like he's trying to evangelize, but ultimately you're in your parents house. If they want to let him into their home, that's their right.

Soft YTA because I hate that kind of religious shit and it's beyond rude to just show up to your house uninvited regularly but you did overstep what your parents wanted for their own house.", "YTA\n\nWhile this guy is a pain for you, it's clear that your parents think otherwise and it's their place.

But at the end of the day, it isn\u2019t your home. It\u2019s your parents. And your parents clearly like having him around. You saying he can\u2019t come around is stepping on their authority.

Have a pretty much zero tolerance of their presence after that. They left me alone and unconscious in the room with what I consider a predator.

Your parents are not AHs for making you apologize for being rude.", "NTA whatsoever! I can completely imagine the situation because the same thing happened to me when I was a teenager. I am in my 30s now. We had an invasive/annoying pastor that made snarky remarks, and had the social intelligence of a gnat. You are not wrong. Your parents probably went nuclear because they might be embarrassed and care what this pastor thinks. I have no doubt later on down the road they will understand your reaction. But seriously, what the hell is wrong with people like this? It\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s rude and entitlement at its finest. The good news is, when you eventually have your own place, you won\u2019t have to deal with bullshit like this.", "NTA\n\nThere's a difference between being grateful and being submissive. Grateful is good. Submissive is not. Pastor man is going to keep pushing until you accept Jesus as your personal savior. That's not hyperbole, that's literally what he is doing. He will keep pushing until he understands that his pushing is no longer acceptable.", "ESH.\n\nUnfortunately you don't get to dictate who comes and goes into your parents' home. It's their house, so they can decide if and when they want to have visitors.\n\nAt the same time, nobody can force you to hang out with this person. You get to draw your own boundaries. If you think that someone is weird or creepy, you have all the right in the world to refuse to interact with them.", "YTA \n\nYou DO NOT get to dictate who can visit your parent's house.  A house you DO NOT OWN.\n\nIf you don't like this man, when he comes over, LEAVE.\n\nI am amazed at how entitled kids have become over the years.", "NTA...You're an adult and you're allowed to tell someone how you feel about their actions. He has no problems telling you what he thinks, so why should it be different for you?  Your parents need to acknowledge your feelings, instead of worrying so much about the embarrassment.", "ESH.\nYou for your attitude.\nThe pastor for his.\nYour parents for theirs.", "Even though I had a good chuckle, YTA. I would have paid good money to see that.", "NTA. It is very annoying.", "NTA - And your parents are falling right into this creep's cult routine. I presume this is your parents home so you don't really have the right to say that they cannot have him as a visitor. However, you are an adult and you have no obligation to have anything to do with sucky, slimy people like this. Tell him to his face that you want nothing further to do with him and you will not sit and listen to him ever again. Leave the room and seriously consider telling your parents to put an f'ing sock in it the next time they tell you to apologize. Don't cook for him, refuse to see or speak to him. If your parents give you grief when he's there, leave the house. You really need to start looking at how to get into your own place because this is not going to end up anywhere good. The next thing you know, they're going to drag you into that church and force you through some  sort of conversion to make this clown happy. I would also expect them to start bleeding money into his pockets at any time, if they aren't already.  Stealing is all that kind of slime cares about.", "NTA, you told him how you felt about him just showing up whenever he wants to and is always doing things to creep you out. He left on his own and from your post you didn't ask him to leave. Your parents on the other hand are AH for flipping out on you for telling him how you felt rather than sit down with you and ask why he made you feel that way.", "YTA\n\nYou should've expressed that to your parents if you felt so strongly. You just made the situation uncomfortable for everyone. It was very rude but i think you know that. Your parents' reaction is understandable. You should think carefully before you say things or don't and deal with the consequences.", "YTA, if you're so uncomfortable then move out and go NC", "NTA. Without bashing anyone's religion, what your parents did was an overreaction.  \nYou also live in that house, you have rights to privacy and not have to deal with people you don't like.  \n\n\nThey have an outdated mentality regarding religious \"authorities\".

Granted, it\u2019s your parents\u2019 house, not yours, but his behavior is offensive to you personally.\n\nI laughed when I read about him flouncing out of the house.

The simplest thing to do is not answer the door. Just because you are home doesn\u2019t mean you are home waiting for him to drop by.

But he is showing absolutely no respect for you. Helping someone does not make him entitled to show up whenever he wants and judge you or try to convert you. That\u2019s asinine. \n\nYour family needs to set boundaries, like that he needs to call before stopping by, and not ask you to do favors for him. If your parents want to do favors for him, whatever. \n\nIf he was truly helping out of the goodness of his heart and in the name of his God, it should be no-strings-attached and he should go on his merry way.
