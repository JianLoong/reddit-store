I doubt your mom would have liked that. \n\nAre you TA for going to the graduation of someone you have a good relationship with? No. It probably wasn't wise to take your younger siblings with you, but that wasn't TA move either. Your mom is, by your statement, not wanting the family to attend bc SHE didn't get invited.

You're right, your step brother's disagreements with your parents shouldn't affect his relationships with his siblings.

A strong bond between siblings can be a life saver, especially with parents like that.", "This really sounds like an lgbt issue. Sudden relationship change, fight with parents about it, so upset all contact is cut with them, and then top it off with a grandparent also being upset?

But you are young and had good intentions. \n\nReading again and saw they felt they deserved to go so it isn't as if they are outcasting your brother...so definitely no reason to punish the rest of you. \n\nNTA but think next time...you are nearly legal so no problem going like you did.", "You're NTA for being a supportive sibling, especially since it seems like your stepbrother doesn't have much support at all.\n\nI find it fascinating that your mother, apparent step-mom to the college grad, immediately jumps to threats of police involvement, while your stepdad quickly deescalated that choice. I'm glad, because your mom is definitely an AH for that.\n\nThe unfortunate factor is that as a 17 year old, it wasn't really your decision to bring other minors along a hefty road trip without parental consent. I'm not gonna say YTA for that because it seems like you and your siblings are the only support your stepbrother can depend on, even if it involves the risk of rule breaking.\n\nIn the future, assuming this feud between your stepbrother and parents continues, I'd strongly urge caution when choosing which rules to defy.
