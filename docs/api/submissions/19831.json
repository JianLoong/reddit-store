Looks like you need them with your mom.", "ESH you took a 9 year old an overnight trip when you were expecting to sleep in your car. There's no correct way to go about it, and I'm glad y'all made the best of it and that your brother was happy to y'all. Whatever trouble they try to put you in will be worth it everytime years down the line when y'all are in the same room with your step bro reminiscing about that time y'all surprised him for his graduation.", "I hope you all continue to be close.

I'm not reeeeally the asshole here, am I reddit? I just do not understand, and that OPs mom was praised about caring about her blood-related child, but not her step-daughter who just lost her mother. Ugh, you can obviously see how much those comments messed with me.", ">This really sounds like an lgbt issue.\n\nMr Fantastic wants his superpower back.", "Yes a 17 year old can.

But the nine year old makes it ESH for me.", "I love how just relating this from my perspective is so offensive to so many. That sounds like my story, sounds like a lot of my friends stories, but just pointing it out as a possibility and suddenly just flooded with angry comments about how dare I suggest it as a possibility.
