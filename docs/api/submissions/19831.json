Especially your dipshit stepdad for saying you need to apologize to your mom.", "It\u2019s very sad to have to celebrate a milestone like college graduation without your family.  I\u2019m glad you and your siblings went to support your stepbrother.  I hope you all had an amazing time together.  Sounds like you have a strong relationship and that will serve you all so well as adults.  Keep loving and supporting each other.", "NTA. Your mom has made this all about her and her husband. It's extremely petty of her to attempt to sabotage your relationship with your stepbrother. I'm curious as to why they aren't speaking to your stepbrother; that could impact my vote, honestly. \n\nDid you earn your grounding? Certainly, assuming you are still a legal minor. The police threat was likely posturing, though it would have been interesting  to see all the dirty laundry aired in court. I doubt your mom would have liked that. \n\nAre you TA for going to the graduation of someone you have a good relationship with? No. It probably wasn't wise to take your younger siblings with you, but that wasn't TA move either. Your mom is, by your statement, not wanting the family to attend bc SHE didn't get invited. Logically, we can assume that everyone would've gone if she had received one. So your attendance was disobedient but it doesn't make you TA.", "NTA. You're right, your step brother's disagreements with your parents shouldn't affect his relationships with his siblings. Additionally, I'm sure he really appreciated having your support at his graduation. Maybe he and your parents will eventually have a relationship again, but that shouldn't dictate whether or not you all (siblings) have a relationship with him. Of course, while you're under 18, your parents can restrict your movements and therefore how often you can see him via grounding, taking away your car privileges, etc.", "NTA and your mom sounds like she's on the narcissistic personality spectrum calling you disrespectful for trying to do your own thing and be your own person. I bet she's fun to be around when you fail at something and possibly make her look like a bad mother. Getting someone arrested because their siblings wanted to support them is asinine. Your mom is out of control and your stepdad is a piece of work. I hope you're able to get out of there soon. Don't let them hold you hostage!", "Info: did you take the nine year old?", "NTA your mom is awful for trying to keep you from being there with your brother!

You just got in the way of their \u201cpunishment\u201d for the step bro.", "ESH. Your parents should tell you why they aren't speaking with your brother. You shouldn't have taken your siblings with you. You are underage and it was unwise for you to even go, but you eally shouldn't have agreed to take charge of your siblings.

You should not have taken the rest of you. And your stepbrother should no better than to take you in as they aren't your parent or guardian.
