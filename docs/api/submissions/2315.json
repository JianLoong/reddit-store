I'd say something similar if some man tried to say that to me.", "NTA he\u2018s misogynistic and your husband needs to set boundaries", "NTA as your BIL provoked it, but it could have been handled better and privately.\n\nJust a thought, if your brother in law worships your husband, then a word from your husband should have made him shut up and back off.", "NTA, I understand your husband being upset that it happened in public, but maybe he should take this as a sign that his brother is way out of line. Good on you for setting a boundary, that guy seems a little obsessive.", "NTA.\nYou were standing up for yourself, something that your husband was failing to do. \n\nQuestion, does your husband respect you? Because if he did, he would\u2019ve shut down his BIL the first time he said anything misogynistic.", "NTA\n\nit seems like someone needs to put him in his place..", "NTA\n\nYou are no one's property.  Implying such is toxically misogynistic and bullying.  He deserved whatever comments he gets.  Who cares if it was in public.  You were defending yourself and as this wasn't the first time he pulled this crap he got what he got.", "NTA and I LOVED your response! Lol immature? Maybe, but I always say asinine comments deserve the same level of responses and your BIL deserved what he got", "NTA.  Bullies love weak targets.  And your husband sounds like he isn't willing to back you up when your BIL was doing some sexist crap.  They both need to think twice before they expect you to be a wallflower and accept this nonsense.  You are putting them on notice that they live in your world, not the other way around.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband doesn't want a scene he better make it clear to his brother you aren't his damn property and you don't need his approval for your clothes. And that brother-in-law needs to apologise to you for good measure.\n\nIf your husband won't do that, then that is him choosing that you will make a scene everytime brother-in-law refers to you as an object to be owned.", "NTA\n\nYour brother in law needs to learn to shut his damn mouth. \n\nIt\u2019s 2022. Women are not the property of their husbands.", "ESH but I'm on your side. Your response was immature and inflammatory but this guy was making misogynistic comments. Your husband is also an asshole if he doesn't back you up. If this guy worships your husband surely your husband stepping in and combatting his sexism would actually work, so it seems to me like your husband is a bigger issue.", "ESH \n\nBUT I am on your side 100%\n\nYour husband does not control you, you are not his property and your BIL was an idiot for saying as much and you did the right thing standing up for yourself. However you didn't really need to call him your husband's bitch even if it was true. \n\nBasically at this point, if your husband truly has so much influence over this guy, your Husband is going to have to help clean this up to save the relationship. He is basically going to have to restate what you said to the BIL himself, and make him apology to YOU for the suggestion that you are nothing more than property, and then you can apologize for calling him a bitch.", "Husband is right, but he should also talked to your brother in law and get him to stop dissing you!", "NTA", "ESH , what a shit show. Your husband's an A for not establishing boundaries, his brother's an A for his sexist misogynistic bs, and you're an A for descending to his level .Remember don't wrestle with a pig, you'll both get dirty and the pig likes it", "ESH\n\nYou need to have a serious talk with your husband about this, not a bunch of petty name calling with his brother. His brother is out of line, and as you said, worships the ground he walks on.\n\nThis will also give you important info about your husband, whether he will let misogyny slide \"because family\" or whether he will be a good husband.", "ESH, but you've got my support for having to deal with this twit..  I don't blame your husband for being upset- you were both acting like children.  \n\nMyself,  I'd go for laughing, patting him on the cheek, and saying something like \"oh sweetie, no wonder you're single,\" and then walking away.", "ESH\n\nYour husband being angry because his BIL and wife are acting like teenagers is justified.", "ESH.
