I'd say something similar if some man tried to say that to me.", "NTA he\u2018s misogynistic and your husband needs to set boundaries", "NTA as your BIL provoked it, but it could have been handled better and privately.\n\nJust a thought, if your brother in law worships your husband, then a word from your husband should have made him shut up and back off.", "NTA, I understand your husband being upset that it happened in public, but maybe he should take this as a sign that his brother is way out of line. Good on you for setting a boundary, that guy seems a little obsessive.", "NTA.\nYou were standing up for yourself, something that your husband was failing to do. \n\nQuestion, does your husband respect you?

You were defending yourself and as this wasn't the first time he pulled this crap he got what he got.", "NTA and I LOVED your response! Lol immature? Maybe, but I always say asinine comments deserve the same level of responses and your BIL deserved what he got", "NTA.  Bullies love weak targets.  And your husband sounds like he isn't willing to back you up when your BIL was doing some sexist crap.  They both need to think twice before they expect you to be a wallflower and accept this nonsense.  You are putting them on notice that they live in your world, not the other way around.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband doesn't want a scene he better make it clear to his brother you aren't his damn property and you don't need his approval for your clothes.

Women are not the property of their husbands.", "ESH but I'm on your side. Your response was immature and inflammatory but this guy was making misogynistic comments. Your husband is also an asshole if he doesn't back you up.

However you didn't really need to call him your husband's bitch even if it was true. \n\nBasically at this point, if your husband truly has so much influence over this guy, your Husband is going to have to help clean this up to save the relationship. He is basically going to have to restate what you said to the BIL himself, and make him apology to YOU for the suggestion that you are nothing more than property, and then you can apologize for calling him a bitch.", "Husband is right, but he should also talked to your brother in law and get him to stop dissing you!", "NTA", "ESH , what a shit show.
