We told everyone right away though.\n\nWe were also young, and I think a lot of folks expected it to be a \"starter marriage\" or a whoops kind of thing.  No one was ever mean about it, but they did take a little while to warm up to the idea (not to either of us personally, but the idea that we were married). \n\nBut here's the deal.  The one time his mother asked some pointed questions that put me in a bad light, my husband shut her down and then didn't talk to her for 10 months.  I actually ended up facilitating a reconciliation, because my husband admitted to me that at that point, he didn't know how to re-approach his mother, and we lived multiple states away, so he couldn't just call her and arrange a lunch.\n\nLike I said, we were young.\n\nAnyway...  your husband isn't doing enough to make it clear that his family's behavior is unacceptable.  Telling them to stop isn't enough if they don't stop.  He needs to initiate going lower-contact with them...  probably don't cut them off entirely like my husband did...  but you should never be in a position to listen to your BIL talk like this, and if he does, you both just leave the event.  Period.  No games, no clap backs, BIL probably gets off on upsetting you.  Don't give him that reward.  Your involvement in their lives is a privilege for them.  Take it away."]}
