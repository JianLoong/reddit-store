Your sister is being ridiculous by trying to make an issue out of something that is not an issue (who cares if you have the same inlaws???). And you were an AH by saying she should cancel her wedding.", "You are both TA. Grow up.", "ESH and I don't think Alex needed much convincing that you meant it. It sounds like you meant it.", "ESH, sorry. If you\u2019re both old enough to be getting married you should act like the adults that you are. Put the petty \u201ccompetition\u201d stuff aside and get used to one intertwined family. Otherwise you\u2019re just going to keep running into these snags. \u201cShe got pregnant while I was pregnant to upstage me\u201d is in your future if you can\u2019t squash this now.", "Oh boy do I see a lot of petty bickering in your future. Be prepared for a lifetime of \"she chose that wedding dress to upstage me, no SHE chose that wedding venue to upstage ME, well she got pregnant first to prove a point.\" I wouldn't be surprised if your inlaws went low contact with all 4 of you over this behavior. OR....... You could both grow up, act like adults, set boundaries, stop competing with each other and recognize that you'll be in each other's lives whether you like it or not, so might as well try to get along. Would you consider helping each other plan your respective weddings so you're both happy and don't step on each other's toes?", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have made that comment about her ending her engagement and she should grow up and realize that you are not out to steal her spotlight.", "ESH. The timing of your engagement to Nick is pretty suspect, like maybe you guys caught \"wedding fever\", but whatever. Your sister isn't doing herself any favors by criticizing you to her future in-laws - it will just make her look bad to them. You had no reason to tell her to call off her wedding in front of her in-laws. You both need to learn to support each other - you have two weddings coming up and the pressure is just going to get worse.", "ESH. You're both behaving like children..", "NTA\n\nShe seems adamant that she does not want the same inlaws as you. As I assume you do not plan on cancelling your wedding, you gave her the only other available option.\n\nHer not liking that option is her problem.", "lmao what are these comments\n\nNTA she started it", "So why was she so hell-bent on jamming your families together? Was it so you would see she \"won\" the in-laws over you? I mean I'm having a hard time calling you the AH only because I absolutely would have said \"Well if you don't like it you can cancel your wedding\" LOL Besides, she kept poking you about it! \n\nHave you tried asking her exactly what she expects to happen? Because it sounds to me like she wants you to cancel your wedding... So it only seems fair that you would say it to her too.\n\nShe's being an absolute child about this and it sounds like she's ruining your relationship with your in-laws even farther, So I'm sure she's an AH... I just don't know about you.", "ESH - you both sound impossible and frankly your husbands-to-be really ought to reconsider this entire soap opera mess.  I'd love to have the ticket concession to holiday dinners--they'll be next-level cage matches, I swear.", "ESH sounds like your future is going to be a lot of competitions. Someone neutral to have a conversation might help.", "This some true hick shit. I think you might need to analyze your life. Esh", "I mean you've been broken up for three years and sometime within the year she's been engaged you two reconnected, started dating again AND got engaged. I can see if there's a competitive history there she'd see it as personal. \n\nYour comment IN FRONT of the in-laws that she cancel her wedding shows there's at least some bad blood between you. How you thought breaking up their son's engagement would ingratiate them to you I have no idea. Also ridiculous to act surprised that Alex is upset you told his fiance she shouldn't marry him. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re asking someone to cancel a wedding. Your family at that. For frivolous reasons. Sorry.", "YTA\n\nClearly your intent was to harm.
