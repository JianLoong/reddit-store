OR....... You could both grow up, act like adults, set boundaries, stop competing with each other and recognize that you'll be in each other's lives whether you like it or not, so might as well try to get along.

The timing of your engagement to Nick is pretty suspect, like maybe you guys caught \"wedding fever\", but whatever. Your sister isn't doing herself any favors by criticizing you to her future in-laws - it will just make her look bad to them.

Was it so you would see she \"won\" the in-laws over you? I mean I'm having a hard time calling you the AH only because I absolutely would have said \"Well if you don't like it you can cancel your wedding\" LOL Besides, she kept poking you about it! \n\nHave you tried asking her exactly what she expects to happen? Because it sounds to me like she wants you to cancel your wedding... So it only seems fair that you would say it to her too.\n\nShe's being an absolute child about this and it sounds like she's ruining your relationship with your in-laws even farther, So I'm sure she's an AH...

How you thought breaking up their son's engagement would ingratiate them to you I have no idea. Also ridiculous to act surprised that Alex is upset you told his fiance she shouldn't marry him.

You can stop hanging out with your stepsister and Alex since it only causes chaos.  If she starts drama while families are around, just put her on mute and walk away.  She is banking on your reaction, show maturity and disengage.  \n\nQuestion:  Has your step sister always sought attention while double down on causing trouble?   What does Nick say about this?
