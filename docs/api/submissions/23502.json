I wouldn't match it. I would just put in as much the person who put in the least.\n\n\ud83e\udd47\n\nNTA and this was an excellent response. Fair and equitable.\n\nYour brother is \"man of the household\" for his house and needs to figure stuff out.  Also, he and his wife need to look at the possibility of her working if it will improve the overall family finances.\n\nAnd I would suggest putting your family on an info diet about the nitty gritty of your finances.", "NTA- not your kids not your problem\u2026", "NTA, they hounded him to get married and have kids, they can support him. Here\u2019s a crazy idea, his wife can get a job and your parents can watch the kids or they can all chip in to pay for daycare. If you cut them all off, I wouldn\u2019t be mad at you.", "This is wild to me cause you specifically said you\u2019d match the lowest contributor. If your brother needs says\u2026 $2,000 this month then why doesn\u2019t everyone pitch in? Between you, your 7 siblings and your parents that\u2019s 10 people to help contribute. $100 each and the brother is fine, which is what family is supposed to do, right? \n\nHow much have the rest of them contributed?", "That was my thought. I know that Mormonism isn\u2019t the only cult obsessed with members having kids, but as someone raised in it it\u2019s always going to be where my brain goes first", "Any religion tbh", "NTA. Your money, your lifre your choices.  And good for your for thowing their words back at them.", "Huge, massive NTA. I cannot fathom what world we live in where families believe they are entitled to any members resources. I would tell them to get fucked.", "Hoarding your blessings. WTF?! That's nuts. Sounds like some people wish to redistribute the wealth and it's your wealth they want to redistribute to your sibling. I've seen this before parents that can't stand for some reason to have a kid successful and happy.", "NTA. They gave him the shitty push to have kids before prepping unlike you they can help fix the problem", "NTA. Brother shouldn't have kids he cant afford, and parents should put their money where their mouth is. You only get one life, dont spend it financing someone else's bad decisions.", "INFO: Are you saving money for a family or do you have a huge house and fancy cars and take international vacations?", "NTA you and your husband are in no way obligated to help anyone. Even if you made 9 figures! Your brother needs to take care of his own responsibilities. His wife could get a paying job.", "NTA you're not even saying no to helping you're just telling them to stop counting your money... like wth?", "Childcare and midwifery seem to be the common choice of options. I swear all the duggar women became midwives."]}
