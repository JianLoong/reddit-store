NTA at all, I have a hard time even telling a friend that (though I know I should). Maybe suggest he buy a compact mirror to check himself before meetings? Lmao that is so crazy and fross", "NTA but you sort of have designated yourself as the booger checker for doing this so much for so long lmao. After the third time I would just accept that he is a booger man now and not say anything", "NTA.\n\nHe's a grown-ass man, he should have gotten the gist of it after the second time.", "LOL - you aren't the booger police.  He's old enough to check his own nose.  NTA.", "NTA, though if your boss gets mad again maybe you could just say, \"Hey, I have reminded you every single day up until a couple days ago. Why don't you just stop in the bathroom and check for yourself before we meet with clients?\"", "This post made me laugh. \n\nNTA\n\nHe should just assume he DOES since you've been telling him every day for weeks! LOL!", "Yeah, if you\u2019ve been telling him every single day, it\u2019s time for him to get a clue, realize it\u2019s going to *keep* happening every single day, and take care of himself like a big boy. You\u2019re not an asshole. (Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too common for people like him to expect assistants like you to do everything short of wiping their butt in the bathroom.)", "NTA- he is an adult, he got told a few days in a row he had nose clingers, then a normal person would then check every morning themselves.  Not your job to cull the nose clingers.", "This is so funny!  Thank you.  I love the job description part.  Definitely NTA.", "Wow NTA, you\u2019re completely correct it\u2019s not your job to tell him these things, he\u2019s an adult and OMG check a damn mirror!! I have a coworker who comes to ask me after they eat lunch to ask a quick \u201cdo I have something in my teeth?\u201d BUT we work outside not with easy access to mirrors, and this person is very shy and I\u2019m more of a trusted friend to them. So it doesn\u2019t bother me, and it only happens once a day, if that. I think it\u2019s cute lol, and if I wanted it to stop I could say something. Also if my coworker ended up with spinach in their teeth and a customer told them they would NOT come complain at me for not catching it, they\u2019d just be really embarrassed and not say Anything. This story is too much I don\u2019t blame you OP I\u2019d be pissed, boss has no right to essentially blame you for his lack of hygiene checks.", "NTA. if a grown ass man can\u2019t wipe his boogers that is on him, not you. if he wants to make you his personal booger checker, you need a raise.", "The sooner you apply for jobs that pay more, the quicker you make more to not look at boogers.", "Omg NTA, if I was told this once I would be paranoid and looking in the mirror multiple times a day for weeks. What a weirdo", "NTA -  Buggers are personal property and best left unnoticed in their natural habitat! Save the buggers!", "NTA, apologize and get him a gift.

You've alerted him to the fact that he has a repeated problem, which is all you can reasonably do.
