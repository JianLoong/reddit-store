As an adult now I can honestly say that my preferred parent is my stepfather, who married my mum when I was 3. He was always honest with me, a bit rough around the edges, but I got treated just like his kids.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for so much of my personal experiences in the comment, but you need to understand from the child\u2019s perspective. \n\nThis just pulls down kids\u2019 self esteem.

My sister's ex was an absolute deadbeat but we never had a single bad thing to say about him in front of her/his kids because he's their dad.
