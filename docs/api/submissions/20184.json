The experience would likely impact them a LOT more than you- however I dont think you are an asshole for not wanting to experience a thing that is very heavy emotionally for most people (your friend included)\n\nI think a compromise would be best- it is possible your friend doesn't want to go alone- due to being Jewish it will probably be pretty heavy for them as well, but also important to them to witness it. It is a part of their history, and they probably want someone with them to share it with and also for emotional support.\n\nI would talk to your friend about it, and see where they stand. If they are okay going alone / with a tour group then no harm there- but if it came down to it and they didn't want to go with anyone but you, I would still go with my friend so they don't have to experience it alone.

I think people are getting really hung up on your wording here because you said \"really bum me out\" in reference to the Holocaust. Which sounded tone deaf. I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging that visiting a site where horrific tragedy occurred has the potential to be deeply emotionally upsetting. And I don't think you're required to go to a dark emotional place. You can still respect and pay homage to a tragedy without visiting the site where it happened. People have different emotional sensitivities.\n\nAnd, people don't have to do everything together. As long as you're respectful about your friend's wishes. If she says she really wants the emotional support of a companion then I would at least consider making the sacrifice.

It's your vacation too.", "NAH and I say this as a Jew. Whenever I go to Europe I try to visit places of historical relevance to jewish people and unfortunately a lot of it is indeed a bummer, but some is really beautiful and fascinating. I was in Prague last September and there are amazing synagogues with super old cemeteries. There are some beautiful memorials for victims of the Holocaust too. There are other ways to learn about our history besides visiting Dachau and I understand if you don\u2019t want to spend 1/3 of your time in Prague at a concentration camp, especially as it\u2019s out of the way. \n\nThat said, if your friend is willing to do something that you want to do but she doesn\u2019t, it would be nice of you to consider doing this with her without complaining.

However - this visit would be a big life event for your friend, would you consider going for support? Don't be surprised if she gets kind of mad when you say 'I want to enjoy the beer and party scene'. I've been to the Holocaust museum in Washington and refused to see the railroad cars because I just don't need to see that. I know what happened, seeing the rail cars won't make it more real.\n\nIt is supposed to be a very powerful experience.", "Suit yourself. I guess the issue is how important your presence at this site to her. Be upfront about your feelings. NTA.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want to go, you shouldn\u2019t.

No one is unreasonable. It would be one thing if it was something like the Anne Frank museum which is in the city center and can be done in an hour, but spending most of one day traveling to and from one specific memorial is a lot of time to spend on something you have no interest in. \n\nJust make sure you find a way to let her know that is respectful and not dismissive.", "NAH. Your reasons are valid.", "I\u2019ve gone on concentration camp tours for a WW2 history trip before.

I would go with him to support him, (as your friend is Jewish, this is kind of an important pilgrimage for him), but if you can sit it out and do something else while he\u2019s visiting the concentration camp, then they might be a better way to protect your mental health.

That's a really gross outlook on one of the most important events in history. I think it's wrong, and quite frankly, offensive, to ignore history and distill your view of Europe down to the most superficial parts you enjoy.

It was also a bummer to the 11 million people (including six million Jewish people) who died in camps like Dachau. Major bummer. Their families were also quite bummed, I understand. \n\n\nThere were hundreds of genocides in Europe alone, hundreds in Africa, hundreds in Asia, etc etc. Human history is a long tapestry of groups of humans practicing barbaric slaughter of their fellow man for arbitrary and petty reasons.\n\nNo one should be guilt tripped over not wanting \"holiday\" to contain \"visit concentration camps\". That's not a typical holiday destination unless you specifically want it to be. \n\nThe idea that you either believe that every country you visit you must find a genocide site of some sort to visit and show reverence at (because \"no fun allowed\") or slightly more worrying you literally believe that \"holocaust\" is the only notable part of Europe and the only reason you should go is to pay respects and spend time at concentration/death camps\n\nNTA", "I don't think OP is an asshole but I upvoted this purely for the sass", "The only way you can visit Dachau from Prague in a day is to take an overnight train there the night before, visiting it during the day, and take an overnight train back.

I\u2019m guessing based upon how long it takes to drive there and accounting for having to change trains at least once, if not a lot of times, in Germany.\n\nETA: Curiosity got the better of me. I did check. If you leave Prague at 02:30 you will arrive at 08:33.

That's something you might say about a minor inconvenience, not contemplating the horrors that were carried out during the holocaust. How can you type that out OP, and not realise that YTA?", "I don't think it's not wanting to be a grown up or lacking empathy to not want to visit a place that is emotionally draining on a dream vacation.
