The experience would likely impact them a LOT more than you- however I dont think you are an asshole for not wanting to experience a thing that is very heavy emotionally for most people (your friend included)\n\nI think a compromise would be best- it is possible your friend doesn't want to go alone- due to being Jewish it will probably be pretty heavy for them as well, but also important to them to witness it. It is a part of their history, and they probably want someone with them to share it with and also for emotional support.\n\nI would talk to your friend about it, and see where they stand. If they are okay going alone / with a tour group then no harm there- but if it came down to it and they didn't want to go with anyone but you, I would still go with my friend so they don't have to experience it alone.

I think people are getting really hung up on your wording here because you said \"really bum me out\" in reference to the Holocaust. Which sounded tone deaf. I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging that visiting a site where horrific tragedy occurred has the potential to be deeply emotionally upsetting. And I don't think you're required to go to a dark emotional place. You can still respect and pay homage to a tragedy without visiting the site where it happened. People have different emotional sensitivities.\n\nAnd, people don't have to do everything together. As long as you're respectful about your friend's wishes. If she says she really wants the emotional support of a companion then I would at least consider making the sacrifice.

Whenever I go to Europe I try to visit places of historical relevance to jewish people and unfortunately a lot of it is indeed a bummer, but some is really beautiful and fascinating. I was in Prague last September and there are amazing synagogues with super old cemeteries. There are some beautiful memorials for victims of the Holocaust too. There are other ways to learn about our history besides visiting Dachau and I understand if you don\u2019t want to spend 1/3 of your time in Prague at a concentration camp, especially as it\u2019s out of the way. \n\nThat said, if your friend is willing to do something that you want to do but she doesn\u2019t, it would be nice of you to consider doing this with her without complaining.

However - this visit would be a big life event for your friend, would you consider going for support? Don't be surprised if she gets kind of mad when you say 'I want to enjoy the beer and party scene'. I've been to the Holocaust museum in Washington and refused to see the railroad cars because I just don't need to see that. I know what happened, seeing the rail cars won't make it more real.\n\nIt is supposed to be a very powerful experience.", "Suit yourself. I guess the issue is how important your presence at this site to her. Be upfront about your feelings. NTA.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want to go, you shouldn\u2019t.

No one is unreasonable. It would be one thing if it was something like the Anne Frank museum which is in the city center and can be done in an hour, but spending most of one day traveling to and from one specific memorial is a lot of time to spend on something you have no interest in. \n\nJust make sure you find a way to let her know that is respectful and not dismissive.", "NAH. Your reasons are valid.", "I\u2019ve gone on concentration camp tours for a WW2 history trip before.

That's a really gross outlook on one of the most important events in history. I think it's wrong, and quite frankly, offensive, to ignore history and distill your view of Europe down to the most superficial parts you enjoy.

Happy to clear this up.", "Good luck getting from Prague to Dachau and back in one day unless you have a car, and even then you're looking at minimum 5h one way. Europe is small, but not *that* small.", "There is an incredible Terezin museum in Prague which focused on the art from the children incarcerated there.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Yeah, I guess I am so used to the guards and bag checks at Synagogue that I forget it\u2019s not normal.", "Yea what if she needs a friend to be there for her emotionally?", "That was my thought as well. I never wanted to watch Schindlers Lust again, but I wasn't going to let my son watch it alone. \n\nYTA", "Again if the friend expresses they want support that is an entirely different conversation. But just because OP isn\u2019t Jewish doesn\u2019t mean they need or want the experience of going to a concentration camp. I was forced on a school trip as a child to go to the museum in DC. The pictures and the shoes were enough for me to know I will not be stepping foot in a concentration, willingly, in my lifetime. Like I said. I think your view is absolute bullshit.", ">OPs Jewish friend\n\n*half-jewish.*\n\nWhich, btw, isn't a real thing.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think that OP is under any obligation to go, because it\u2019s a vacation and you should be able to do what you want. That said, the excuse of \u201cman it would really bum me out\u201d is pretty pathetic. Yeah, you don\u2019t need to seek out every single monument to human suffering whenever you go on a vacation, but when going on a vacation with a _friend who is Jewish, and to whom Dachau has extreme significance_, I think that\u2019s a point where you suck it up and support your friend. \n\nAlso speaking from personal experience, I\u2019ve been to Dachau and I think it\u2019s absolutely something that people should experience. To be where those people were and walk where they walked, it\u2019s incredibly sobering. We shouldn\u2019t spend all of life wallowing in the atrocities of the past, but we absolutely need to remember and be reminded", "This implies that her friend's feelings are more important than her feelings. With this logic, wouldn't the friend be selfish by trying to force someone into an experience they won't enjoy? There's a middle ground where OP can be supportive and not attend if she wishes not to.", "Yeah but a European vacation is a once in a lifetime opportunity for a lot of Americans.

Maybe try Schindlers List instead.", "No need to be rude.\n\nAgain, you're allowed to do or not do things. We don't know if OP's friend wants support, so I'm saying that the least OP could do is offer that support.", "I'm aware it's not a thing, which is why I said Jewish.", "Because their friend has a personal connection to Dachau. I think, if they were a good friend, they would support their friend and go with them.", "France is out of the budget. To visit France they\u2019d have to forego a different part of their trip or OPs friend would have to do it alone. Choosing a different country in OPs budget let\u2019s them explore more of Europe together", "youre making a lot of assumptions about how motivated OPs friend was to go to France. Maybe it is OPs friends life wish to go to france, or maybe it was just a passing preference. we don't know, so calling it significant is really assuming a lot. \n\nAlso, OP isn't just giving up a day of drinking. it isn't OPs duty to go to Dachau and bear witness to the depths of human depravity, especially on what is supposed to be their vacation. as long as OP can find a way to communicate this gently to their friend, they are not TA", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Lol!", "\u201cThe least they can do is support their friend\u201d is not the same thing as saying they should offer support to their friend.", "Sure.\n\nIn other words, OP's friend has no idea that she's not actually jewish.\n\nOr, OP is mistakenly calling her half-jewish. But where would she learn to call her half-jewish except from her?", "So OP's friend did her a favor by skipping France (which she could afford) so that OP would have a travel buddy for her budget trip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTraveling alone is super fun so I don't see how OP \"saved\" her friend from anything or how this compromise benefitted OP's friend.", "France is out of OP's budget.

Not 2...at least 3?\n\nDachau is meaningful to OP's friend.

If OP doesn't want to go, they shouldn't have to. It's not like OP doesn't want to go to a museum or a show, it's a concentration camp. \n\nWe also don't know if the victims include OP's friends family.
