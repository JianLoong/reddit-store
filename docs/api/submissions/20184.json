The experience would likely impact them a LOT more than you- however I dont think you are an asshole for not wanting to experience a thing that is very heavy emotionally for most people (your friend included)\n\nI think a compromise would be best- it is possible your friend doesn't want to go alone- due to being Jewish it will probably be pretty heavy for them as well, but also important to them to witness it. It is a part of their history, and they probably want someone with them to share it with and also for emotional support.\n\nI would talk to your friend about it, and see where they stand. If they are okay going alone / with a tour group then no harm there- but if it came down to it and they didn't want to go with anyone but you, I would still go with my friend so they don't have to experience it alone.

I think people are getting really hung up on your wording here because you said \"really bum me out\" in reference to the Holocaust. Which sounded tone deaf. I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging that visiting a site where horrific tragedy occurred has the potential to be deeply emotionally upsetting. And I don't think you're required to go to a dark emotional place. You can still respect and pay homage to a tragedy without visiting the site where it happened. People have different emotional sensitivities.\n\nAnd, people don't have to do everything together. As long as you're respectful about your friend's wishes. If she says she really wants the emotional support of a companion then I would at least consider making the sacrifice.

Whenever I go to Europe I try to visit places of historical relevance to jewish people and unfortunately a lot of it is indeed a bummer, but some is really beautiful and fascinating. I was in Prague last September and there are amazing synagogues with super old cemeteries. There are some beautiful memorials for victims of the Holocaust too. There are other ways to learn about our history besides visiting Dachau and I understand if you don\u2019t want to spend 1/3 of your time in Prague at a concentration camp, especially as it\u2019s out of the way. \n\nThat said, if your friend is willing to do something that you want to do but she doesn\u2019t, it would be nice of you to consider doing this with her without complaining.

However - this visit would be a big life event for your friend, would you consider going for support? Don't be surprised if she gets kind of mad when you say 'I want to enjoy the beer and party scene'. I've been to the Holocaust museum in Washington and refused to see the railroad cars because I just don't need to see that. I know what happened, seeing the rail cars won't make it more real.\n\nIt is supposed to be a very powerful experience.", "Suit yourself. I guess the issue is how important your presence at this site to her. Be upfront about your feelings. NTA.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want to go, you shouldn\u2019t.

No one is unreasonable. It would be one thing if it was something like the Anne Frank museum which is in the city center and can be done in an hour, but spending most of one day traveling to and from one specific memorial is a lot of time to spend on something you have no interest in. \n\nJust make sure you find a way to let her know that is respectful and not dismissive.", "NAH. Your reasons are valid.", "I\u2019ve gone on concentration camp tours for a WW2 history trip before.

That's a really gross outlook on one of the most important events in history. I think it's wrong, and quite frankly, offensive, to ignore history and distill your view of Europe down to the most superficial parts you enjoy.

The USA didn't officially acknowledge it until 2019 (104 years after the fact) Even Obama skirted the issue by referring to it by an alternative term.

I selected a number of significant Jewish sites and Synagogues that I wanted to see when I was traveling and we also went to many significant Christian sites/Cathedrals that my friend selected as well. I had no idea until we returned from the trip that my friend really resented being taken to so many boring sites (Side note in her defense- many of the Synagogues were nondescript buildings - probably due to the whole persecution thing).

I can't compartmentalize quite so easily and maybe neither can the op.  \n\nAlso, OP is just telling Reddit how she feels with the being bummed out part, you're making it seem like this is what she told her friend, which is not the case.", "While I already know this to be true, I think plenty of people use NAH and NTA interchangeably. And I even think of it as such until i see the first NAH to remind me that its an option lol.", "It's actually about a trip two friends are taking, if that even matters anymore.", "If OP was the one with the bigger budget constraint, then the friend choosing to go to France would have impacted OP.\n\nOP's trip would be more expensive if the traveled alone. \n\nThe friend's compromise enabled the trip.", "The room of hair at Auschwitz", "For education. I\u2019m Jewish but I didn\u2019t have family that I knew in the Holocaust. The folder room had zero personal significance to someone like me, but a bunch of shoes from people who lived? Or rings? Tremendously emotional. \n\n\nOther people need to learn and only us Jews hammer home that we need to Remember That We Suffered. The Holocaust is barely taught in many public schools and there are still people who think it was a hoax despite countless records. The hatred is all coming back around again.", "Can confirm -- been to that museum a handful of times, didn't party for days afterwards because of the weight you take after visiting it", "Myself and two mates sat in silence (I think one might have broken the silence once or twice with simply, \"fuck\") on the train back to Krakow after visiting Auschwitz. We needed that ride to properly take in what we'd just seen. We got off the train, went back to the apartment to change, met our other mates who didn't come to the camp and went for dinner. It wasn't a party, but we all agreed we needed a drink.", "Also how the fuck are you in the right mindset after literally going to a fucking concentration camp to go party in the evening? How can you just snap your mind out of that headspace to go have fun at night? I find that to be more disrespectful than telling a friend that you don\u2019t want to go with them cause it\u2019s a bummer.", "They might already have one, but if not they definitely need a pinned post with the voting options", "Glad to help!", "You're so eloquent. Perfect response. \ud83d\udc4c", "I dunno why they think that. Maybe it's like when women talk about the horrible things that have happened and are still happening to them, and men respond by saying that men have issues too, or #notallmen.\n\nBefore you assholes say it, no I'm not comparing women's issues with the Holocaust.", "...and? That doesn't make it a compromise. The friend didn't compromise. Because that implies there was a dispute. \n\nBut \"I have to go here or I can't go\" isn't a dispute. If OP wanted to go to Norway and Friend wanted to go to France and they decide to go to Germany - THAT is a compromise (not one that would settle much but a compromise) because then they are settling a disagreement. \n\nBut if the options are \"This or Nothing\" THAT IS NOT A COMPROMISE. If the friend changed plans to include OP it is because a point of the Europe trip was to go with OP. The destination was not as important. Also important to note - if they HAD gone to France, Friend would be way LESS likely to get to see Dachau.\n\nSo basically this \"compromise\" which was actually just basic holiday planning is what enabled Friend to go in the first place. So why does OP need to spend their money to spend part of their very limited holiday time at a place they know is going to put them in a poorer headspace?", "You won\u2019t be.

As far as I know, the [Final Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution) was organized and executed after a long period of less genocidal formalized antisemitism - which included plans like [deporting Jews to Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_Plan). Or [check this out](https://www.annefrank.org/en/timeline/56/the-gestapo-deports-polish-jews-to-poland/).\n\n>there is a difference in a multitude of actors in a scenario versus all actors acting under a specific racial policy that coordinates all or most arms actions and functions of a nation...You haven\u2019t established that any of the factors I have mentioned were present in the Indigenous genocide.\n\nSo a governor of state saying what I quoted and then organizing campaigns to go out and exterminate Indigenous populations doesn't count?\n\nOr the [Conquest of the Desert](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2506294.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A787ca51bfea49fe4d4abdd59ba391559&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1), which saw the Argentine government and military geared towards \"extinguishing\" Indigenous populations through massacre and enslavement? [Or the British government's actions in Tasmania](https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-evidence-for-the-tasmanian-genocide-86828)?\n\nAre you really saying that there weren't specific racial policies that coordinated most functions of a nation in Indigenous genocides?\n\n[I really recommend this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1185909.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5183ae51b6981f750a62d3c5e245e905&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1), although I sadly can't find a public version (if anyone does, please link it!)\n\n>You haven\u2019t established that any of the factors I have mentioned were present in the Indigenous genocide.\n\nI showed that \"borders\" weren't followed.\n\n>Here\u2019s one that was not present in the Indigenous genocide: The Nazi\u2019s believed that they were the victims of an international Jewry scheme that lost them the first World War...Zyklon B...gas\n\nOf course things like Zyklon B and gas and international banking weren't relevant to genocides of Indigenous Americans. Those things didn't exist yet. If you want to argue that the Holocaust was *technologically* distinct from Indigenous genocides you're undeniably right - and different technologies lead to other, compounding differences. But that's not really the salient point, is it? I don't think it's what you're saying. If you want to argue that the Holocaust was unique because of its coordination, I point you again to that first article about the Conquest of the Desert - it details the carefully coordinated military plans of the Argentinian army involved in that genocide. If you want to talk about \"efficiency,\" you need to do work in defining how that's measured, and at the onset I think there's something to be said about the twisted \"successes\" of colonial Europeans *entirely wiping out Indigenous groups*, which didn't happen in the Holocaust.\n\nLike I said earlier, I do think there's probably a case to be made for the uniqueness of the Holocaust. I just don't think that case rests exactly where you're saying. And I think it has more to do with uniqueness that results from differences in gradation (of industrialism, \"scientific\" racism) and cumulative features of 21st-century technology than it does a fundamentally new idea of what genocide should be.\n\nI'm not trying to turn this into \"who or what was worse.\" I don't think my language expresses that, but I also want to make it explicit that that's not what I'mtrying to do.", "That's a great point. I'll have to mull this connection over. As a psychology nerd this is my favorite thing to consider, people's behaviors and the \"why\". So thanks for that\ud83d\ude0a"]}
