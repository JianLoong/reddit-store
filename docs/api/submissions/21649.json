I had to check in every 10 minutes or she would freak out and call the cops. \n\nIt got to be too much and we divorced. Anna was very young when this happened and because of some prior criminal charges, I got full custody.

I was more than okay with that because it\u2019s a free phone, what\u2019s the downside?\n\nWell the downside is that my ex is doing the same thing to Anna now. If the tracking software shows she\u2019s anywhere but my house, work, or school [before it let out for summer], she will panic. Anna told me about this and how annoying it gets. \n\nI talked to my ex and she said she would stop but Anna said that never happened. So I got a new phone for her without the tracking software. She leaves her moms phone at my house and will occasionally call or text her mom on it, but if she\u2019s going out with friends she won\u2019t bring it. \n\nThat was fine for about 2 weeks until they ran into each other at target and my ex figured out what was going on.

After that, I have tracked their location 3 times: once to double check eldest was on the right bus because the phone cut out and I wasn't sure she understood, twice when youngest lost her phone and we were working out where it might be.  Youngest lied about where she was once last year and was grounded for a month, she hated it, regained my trust over a little while and has her freedom back.\n\nAt 17, you're very nearly an adult and tracking them obsessively is just creepy.  She definitely needs the freedom to just be herself, and your solution sounds like the most peaceful option.", "NTA. I legit saw this on an episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d.  Too much tracking/sheltering your kids can lead to them doing anything to experience freedom; any detrimental thing to break away from the prison that is you.  (They used to say the same thing about Catholic school girls back in the day, about how they\u2019d \u201cgo wild\u201d the minute they graduated high school).", "NTA. Though I think you could have pushed it further and just confronted her about the fact that she hasn\u2019t stopped this behavior after she said she would. You could have just told her that you\u2019re buying another phone. I would be sure to send it back to make the point. This is about establishing boundaries, and I think there\u2019s a way here to be firm without being mean or hateful.\n\nThough as others have said, I think her mental health is concerning. I won\u2019t rehash it here.", "nta", "NTA good on you for showing your daughter that this behaviour is not normal in any relationship,family or not", "Your wife\u2019s behavior is seemingly compulsive. Has she seen someone for this? Before alienating her daughter? Your NTA", "why is your daughter conforming to her mom's obsessions?  Your daughter can go NC if she wants to.  Let the ex deal with that for a few months.  You can't reason with nuts.", "NTA. Im really happy/grateful your daughter has you to confide in.", "NTA. Both of my kids 18M and 11M have iPhones, both of them are required to keep their locations shared with me at all times but it is only so that if something happens to them I have their last known location in Find my iPhone app. I also share my location with them, my sister and my best friend at all times too. I do not check up on them. I don\u2019t question where they are or what they are doing because at any given time I know where they are and who they are with. \n\nIn the times we live in the only reason I want their location shared with me is because people go missing so easily.", "She needs therapy. NTA.", "Wow. Your ex sounds like one of my ex's baby mama. The kids didn't have smartphones, though. They had to text their mom all the time to let her know where they were, even when their father had visitation. She would randomly block my ex's phone number, along with mine and my son's. No one knows why. Their father ended up getting them phones so that couldn't happen.\n\nIt turns out the mom has severe schizophrenia. It got so bad that my ex had to get emergency placement and she had to go inpatient for treatment. Thankfully, she got so much better. She actually never remembered why she blocked the numbers. The emergency placement got dropped and custody went back to the way it was. The kids actually asked that it go back to the original custody arrangement 70/30 with my ex having the 30. \n\nYour ex needs help. There is something very wrong with her. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou respect your daughter\u2019s privacy, and that\u2019s great. You want to give her the freedom that every teenage girl deserves. If the mother does not want to give her the privacy, then you did the best solution possible, without causing any major problems. When I was seventeen i loved my privacy, and i think your daughter loves the privacy you give her today.", "NTA.\n\nLet me rephrase it for you: An adult woman spying 17yrs old girl. \n\nIs it okay to you? who knows maybe her chat, picture taken can be shows up to this adult woman.. are you okay with your child pic, private chat, location shared with this adult woman?", "NTA sounds like your ex needs therapy for this separation anxiety and controlling behaviors", "NTA. Your house, your rules. She may be able to force your daughter to use her phone at her house but she can't force her to use it at your house.", "NTA. Your ex sounds like she needs major therapy, I actually do pity her. But she can\u2019t take her mental health issues out on you or daughter, it\u2019s not fair", "number of people on reddit that think \"You got full custody, you are the one to legally decide\" is good parenting is insane.", "if your daughter has an iphone, then she'll get notifications that she has an airtag on her (in a bag or purse).\n\ni found this out while chaperoning a school trip. parents put airtags in their kids' luggage, the teachers with iphones got notifications that airtags were following them. as an android user, i did not.", "Honestly sounds like a weekend a month is still too much given the abuse of this contact. At 17 Anna is old enough to make independent decisions on how she spends her time, so I think the best option is to be the only parent making these decisions. Don't try reasoning with crazy, just let Anna decide how/if she maintains contact with her.", "YES. I asked my bestie, who's more like a sibling than anything, if it would be ok for me to share my location with their phone as a just-in-case. So if they wanted to, they could see exactly where I am at any given time *because I gave them permission to.\"\n\nI told myself that if I ever had kids, this is how I'd do it: \"This phone shares your location with me. It also shares *my* location with *you.* This is not so we can spy on each other, but so if there's an emergency, we can *find* each other.\"\n\nBut somehow I feel if the daughter said to the mom \"ok, well let me track your phone then - I'd feel safer knowing where you are,\" it would *not* go over well.", "Not for a minor.  You just tell them why and don\u2019t abuse it.  My family can see where I am. I normally use it to see how close they are when meeting me. Sometimes to ensure they are back at whatever friends house they said they were sleeping at.  They use it to find their devices that they loose constantly.", "This is reminding me of that Black Mirror episode", " Yeah, they think it is weird.", ">Your hatred of your ex is showing.\n\nYour hatred of OP is showing. I think you should reread what op wrote and see how you got it majorly wrong.", "You need to go back and reread the post. OP literally stated he tried talking to the mother, mother said she would stop and never did. \n\nOP has full and legal custody. That means he can unilaterally make the decision to get his daughter a second phone, so she can have privacy and not have her every action and movement tracked and followed and questioned. \n\nOP is NTA here.
