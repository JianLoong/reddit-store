I had to check in every 10 minutes or she would freak out and call the cops. \n\nIt got to be too much and we divorced. Anna was very young when this happened and because of some prior criminal charges, I got full custody.

I was more than okay with that because it\u2019s a free phone, what\u2019s the downside?\n\nWell the downside is that my ex is doing the same thing to Anna now. If the tracking software shows she\u2019s anywhere but my house, work, or school [before it let out for summer], she will panic. Anna told me about this and how annoying it gets. \n\nI talked to my ex and she said she would stop but Anna said that never happened. So I got a new phone for her without the tracking software. She leaves her moms phone at my house and will occasionally call or text her mom on it, but if she\u2019s going out with friends she won\u2019t bring it. \n\nThat was fine for about 2 weeks until they ran into each other at target and my ex figured out what was going on.

This is a psychological problem, and not a parenting choice proven by her treatment of you. She\u2019s controlling, obsessive, and clearly manipulative. If I were you I would cut off unsupervised visits, take your daughter to go have lunch/dinner with her with you watching from another table or from a car facing the door etc. I can guarantee you that if you keep allowing her to go over there your ex is going to use other methods to get what she wants wants. Be it AirTags, Tile Tags, Sharing ICloud/Apple ID, or getting into your daughters phone to download apps that give her access (then delete it off or the home screen so your daughters unaware). \n\nWhen that happens and you cut off those methods if she\u2019s as obsessed as I think she is, she\u2019ll probably start essentially stalking your daughter in person. There\u2019s also the danger that if she feels like you\u2019re taking away all her means of control she at the absolutely worst case scenario may lie to your daughter and just take her away from you. By that I mean \u201coh we\u2019re going to stay with grandma and grandpa for the weekend\u201d then just never bring her back. If you do decide to keep allowing her over there you need to be checking her bags for tags everytime, and consistently checking for spyware apps on the phone you bought. I honestly may not even allow her to take the phone you bought over there at all. \n\nBesides downloading spyware she could \u201caccidentally\u201d break it so she\u2019s forced to use hers 24/7. Get one of those things that look like keychains that have an emergency button to alert you. That way you know if your daughter needs help and to go over there and get her. I say that because her mom could take (her) phone while she\u2019s over there so she can\u2019t leave or call anyone to come get her. People with psychological and control issues like this don\u2019t get better with time, they get exponentially worse. More so when you prevent her from doing so. I really don\u2019t recommend letting your daughter be around her alone until she starts going to therapy. If your ex tries to call names just tell her she has a problem, and you\u2019re not going to continue to enable it and let her negatively affect your daughters mental health. \n\nThat if she feels so strongly about it she can take it up with the court. She can\u2019t by the way, by the time you\u2019d get a court date your daughter would likely be 18. Not to mention that you have full custody do to past legal issues, that coupled with the spying is more than enough to make sure she\u2019d just be wasting her money and time. Your daughters also 4-5 years past the threshold of being able to decide where she wants, the courts value her decision. Then if she keeps harassing you, block her. If even that doesn\u2019t stop her you\u2019ll have to seriously consider a restraining order. Now your daughters nearly an adult, her mothers going to attempt to manipulate and gaslight her to extremes. When that happens because it will, the only way she can regain control of her at that age is if she emotionally blackmails her to let her do so. \n\nYou need to have several conversations with your daughter about this, preparing her, and teaching her it\u2019s okay to stand up for herself and it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love her mom. That her mom just has some issues but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s responsible for enabling her moms compulsions to make her feel better. Remind her that those issues will only grow not lessen, that giving her location eventually won\u2019t be enough she\u2019ll ask for more. It\u2019ll also be much harder when she attempts to stop it down the line, because she would\u2019ve been feeding her moms delusion that she has a right to it.

We do however have an app that we can turn on and off at will.  She's moved away, so when she or I are road tripping, we turn it on just in case something goes wrong and the other can know when we got where we're going in case the \"I made it\" phone call didn't come in on time.
