I had to check in every 10 minutes or she would freak out and call the cops. \n\nIt got to be too much and we divorced. Anna was very young when this happened and because of some prior criminal charges, I got full custody.

I was more than okay with that because it\u2019s a free phone, what\u2019s the downside?\n\nWell the downside is that my ex is doing the same thing to Anna now. If the tracking software shows she\u2019s anywhere but my house, work, or school [before it let out for summer], she will panic. Anna told me about this and how annoying it gets. \n\nI talked to my ex and she said she would stop but Anna said that never happened. So I got a new phone for her without the tracking software. She leaves her moms phone at my house and will occasionally call or text her mom on it, but if she\u2019s going out with friends she won\u2019t bring it. \n\nThat was fine for about 2 weeks until they ran into each other at target and my ex figured out what was going on.

And I know people on this sub do tend to leap straight to mental illness but it does sound like she has pretty severe anxiety about something happening to people she loves. The fact that she called the cops instead of bombarding you with texts accusing you of cheating (the other reason people track their SO) suggests that it\u2019s a way out of proportion concern for your safety, and she\u2019s acknowledged that when talking about your daughter. If that\u2019s the case, she CAN\u2019T stop without help. \n\nSo, NTA for not wanting your ex to track your daughter. It\u2019s invasive and does have the potential to destroy their relationship, and you\u2019re justified in doing whatever it takes to make it stop. If she\u2019s struggling with an anxiety disorder, though, maybe at least try to understand that her motives are good, if misguided, and encourage her to get help?\n\nI\u2019ve known several people with anxiety disorders and the irrational fear of something bad happening is a theme. There\u2019s always a kernel of truth at the base of it - like sure, a wildfire COULD get out of control and destroy our town, but the likelihood of it happening is extremely small. For that friend, though, it meant going to great lengths to prepare for a thing that was probably never going to happen. \n\nNow, if it does happen, the rest of us are going to look pretty stupid.", "NTA you have full custody so parental decisions ultimately are up to you. If you didn\u2019t want the tracking app on your daughter that\u2019s fine. You trust your daughter and soo should her mum.

I still have find my iPhone on for her but she doesn\u2019t check on it every 10 minutes and only uses it when I\u2019m going into the city or a concert. Checking it every 10 minutes and flipping out when her kid actually has a life outside of school work and home is concerning and invasive.

That's not okay.", "NTA -Anne will soon be an adult and have all the rights and freedoms that entails. Tracking her is morally questionable, and let's face it tracking doesn't realistically tell you the status of a person. The Anne could be dead comment is over the top to the point of obsessive. Tracking is not a force shield it's not going to immediately protect a person. It can help find them in certain very limited situations, but it will not do much in immediate life and death mishaps. EX needs to see a psychologist to help with her obsessive disorder. Parents understandably worry, but this sounds well beyond that.", ">Your ex learned nothing \n\nI mean, this is pretty obviously a case for therapy, not just learning from past experiences. The Ex\u2019s reactions are not reasonable or rational.", "I don\u2019t think OP has learned much given that he chose to save money instead of protecting his child.", "agreed. my mother has undiagnosed (officially, she won't see a dr but the psych at the ER the last time I had to take her said it really looks like) bipolar disorder and delusional disorder and when she's in her manic episodes she gets wildly paranoid about stuff and texts me constantly when I'm not home to make sure that I'm okay, even though I'm 42 and have been independent since age 18. \n\nanosognosia is the inability for someone who's sick to actually recognize that their brain needs help - it's usually seen in people with paranoid schizophrenia, sometimes bipolar, and often with delusional disorder.  they'll often refuse both treatment and medication. pair that with delusions that people are out to get you and you can have a pretty dangerous situation.\n\nyou're definitely NTA for trying to protect your daughter's privacy but please keep in mind that unchecked mental illness can be one hell of a beast. if this *is* the case, she's probably not being an AH intentionally and more than likely won't turn dangerous, but it's best to just be aware.", "It might even be PP-OCD. I had it really bad after my kids. OCD is not just, \"I have to switch the lights on and off 3 times to save the world every Monday\". A big part of it can be intrusive thoughts you don't want. When my son first went to pre-k I would cry after I dropped him off in the mornings because I was constantly having scary thoughts of anything that could happen to him and would be so anxious all day until I could pick him up. I became a helicopter parent and if he wasn't in school i would have to keep an eye on him at ALL times. The thoughts aren't planned out. Even now it isn't as bad but even if I'm having a good time, I'll have a flash of something horrible happening relating to what I'm doing and my heart will start beating fast and I'll get anxious. My adrenaline will start pumping and I'll have to calm myself down with breathing exercises.", "There is a black mirror episode about a crazy mother like OPs wife.
