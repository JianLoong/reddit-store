Her mother and I got divorced because she started being very obsessive about knowing details of everything. Where I was going, who I was with, when I expected to be back. I had to check in every 10 minutes or she would freak out and call the cops. \n\nIt got to be too much and we divorced. Anna was very young when this happened and because of some prior criminal charges, I got full custody. I did however allow my ex to have Anna one weekend a month. \n\nAnna\u2019s first phone broke about a year back and my ex offered to buy her a new one. I was more than okay with that because it\u2019s a free phone, what\u2019s the downside?\n\nWell the downside is that my ex is doing the same thing to Anna now. If the tracking software shows she\u2019s anywhere but my house, work, or school [before it let out for summer], she will panic. Anna told me about this and how annoying it gets. \n\nI talked to my ex and she said she would stop but Anna said that never happened. So I got a new phone for her without the tracking software. She leaves her moms phone at my house and will occasionally call or text her mom on it, but if she\u2019s going out with friends she won\u2019t bring it. \n\nThat was fine for about 2 weeks until they ran into each other at target and my ex figured out what was going on. She blew up at me, but I told her this is the reason we got divorced and I don\u2019t want her to drive her own child away too. \n\nShe is claiming it\u2019s negligent and it\u2019s dangerous if she doesn\u2019t know Anna\u2019s safe because she could be dead, which seems like a bit of an over reaction in my eyes.

I can see it possibly with younger kids getting lost but generally it's not going to help prevent anything. It's horrible to say this but if something were to happen, she wouldn't know about it until too late anyway. The best way to keep your daughter safe is to teach her safe behaviours & part of that involves trusting her to do them.", "NTA, you are the hero your daughter needs in her life. \u201cTracking\u201d has to be consensual or it\u2019s wrong.", "NTA noone deserves to be tracked like some kind of animal it is invasive it shows a complete lack of trust an it can even be used to be abusive which is kind of what it sounds like your ex is doing to your daughter, it's not right an you shouldn't allow it.", "NTA - you\u2019re teaching your daughter how to enforce boundaries and protect her autonomy through example. Good for you.", "Easy NTA. You're protecting her mom's paranoia. The irony here is pretty thick: her fear of threats to her daughter is the threat to her daughter.", "Yikes. NTA at all, as I'm sure you know. Did the divorce proceeding include this monitoring junk? Now that it has been shifted to your daughter maybe your ex can be legally banned from this nonsense. Although in the meantime your daughter could die or worse, run off with a rock musician, and how would your ex know? Your ex has a lot of spare time, it seems.", "NTA, she\u2019s almost an adult she should be responsible enough to not need tracking. Sounds like you made the right call with your ex", "NTA. This sounds like some form of mental illness at this point, it\u2019s not healthy for anyone. She is 17, she is making her own way and you are the primary parent here so you have obviously assessed the situation", "NTA.\nYour ex wife is going to stifle any trust your daughter has for her. Tracking someone 24 hours a day is NOT healthy in any respect.\nShe needs therapy for her obviously overwhelming anxiety, not more trackers on your daughter's person. Whether she will or not, sadly, isn't within your control.\n\nYou may have to start checking your daughter's things for airtags too, and be prepared to support your daughter if/when she decides she's no longer going to entertain her mother's presence in her life. Unfortunately this seems like a likely outcome.", "NTA shes 17, in a year shes going to be a legal adult and will have every legal right and reason to not be tracked and there will be nothing her mother can do or say about it that has any weight.

You know this.", "NTA\u2026.you\u2019re the custodial parent who made a parenting decision.", "NTA - Your ex clearly has some mental illness going on. As someone with anxiety myself I feel for her but she needs to get help and leaver her family members alone.", "NTA it's a recent thing to have smartphones and people were fine without them before. When I was a teen I'd get up to some reckless shit but in the end you have to trust your kids to live and learn. \n\nMaybe if she wants that safety net in case something does happen, get her a fitness or smart watch.

Yes she is her mother but she has no custody rights - you make all the decisions.\n\nMake sure she doesnt do anything to track you daughters laptop, and doesnt use air tags and put them in anything that belongs to your daughter.", "I\u2019ll say NTA but close to AH. I\u2019d say since you have full custody, you should\u2019ve gone to her mom, laid down what the deal was, and let her mom deal with it. Having her find out like that is not the right way IMO.

If daughter hasn't already been made aware of her mom's undiagnosed mental illness, she needs to be. Daughter needs to know that mom might be much more ill than anyone realizes and to watch out for any dangerous behaviors. My fear is that as the daughter gains more independence as an adult, it may push the mom over the edge and make her actions extremely unpredictable. At some point, someone may end up having to force the woman into treatment. OP mentions past criminal charges against mom and I am really curious what kind of charges they were. I mean, is she on drugs or something?"]}
