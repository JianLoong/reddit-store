She\u2019s most likely not going to return your calls or see you. You\u2019re probably gonna find out some time later she\u2019s pregnant, and has dropped out of law school.

Were you okay with his comment?\u201d  And if she says she wasn\u2019t ask her why she didn\u2019t say anything.

Especially if you're being as preachy about it as it sounds here and especially if that advice is centered around him potentially trying to stop her studying law, which is nothing but an assumption you are making about what possibly might happen that you present as an inevitability even though it isn't.", "NTA. Your sister is a Golddigger, and that dude is fucking creepy. They both need to he told off here", "NTA. Careful though. He'll probably try to isolate her. It'll be way easier for him to do that if you're fighting.", "Jees. Sounds like you're over reacting", "NTA.  OP said their piece, but unfortunately they can't make sister listen and remove the rose colored glasses.  Sounds like she's internalized some part of this relationship with this AH as elevating herself (his \"success\", his \"maturity \", being taken of like a child, whatever) and that will be hard to break if she doesn't want to see it.  Best you can do is let her know you'll be there when she does.", "NTA, sounds like hes trying to groom her", "NTA.  You sound concerned and I applaud you for that.  Maybe reach out with a softer tone and tell her you are just concerned for her and you just want her to think about the things you said and you want to just be supportive of her.

She can dress any way she wants, regardless of age.  Just sayin.", "NTA but this is a minefield so tread very carefully. You see the red flags and so does she but like many in love she's ignoring them. You will have to change your approach with her going forward of not so much telling her to pull her head out of the sand but as concerns about her future plans for school, her career, kids, etc. The more you try to force her to break up the faster and further you're driving her into his arms.", "NTA. I\u2019d be speaking up to my sister if she were in this situation too. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to hear the truth and I\u2019m sure she already knows this which is why she got defensive.

Men (barely) of her age wont promise that. \nShes flattered. She probably thinks shes got all the life/love/money problems solved with this guy,  or at least that'what she's telling herself atm\n She's only 21 snd was single for a year.

Little does your sister realize, but \u201cbeing taken care of\u201d is literaly a jail sentence. Her life will be dictated by her BF, and it will never be her own. Independence is self preservation, and unfortunately, she is too young to recognize it. Be there to support her, don\u2019t say another bad word against BF (otherwise he will move to isolate her), and hope for the best. Let her know you support her unconditionally. Good luck to all of you!", "NTA. I\u2019d buy her a copy of Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft.

He\u2019s controlling and misogynistic and she probably hasn\u2019t seen the half of it yet.

Just keeps telling herself it wont be so bad. \n\nIts gona be that bad...", "NTA - She is a gold digger and he is an abuser.  What I admire a lot is a law student being so stupid. The end of it will be to be pregnant and alone, after burning bridges with the family, and being exchanged for another young woman of 21, when she is knocked down and with her body detonated at 25, without a job and knocking on her door in search of shelter.

I believe you're trying to do the right thing by warning her, but when in the history of the world has anyone been talked out of dating someone they're into?", "Nope.", "YSH. I wouldn't give you a Y T A because you are right, the dude sounds like a real charmer and when as many flags are getting thrown as this guy you probably should say least pause the game to check out what's happening. But you definitely don't need to tell her that he is going to force her to become a SAHM or trophy wife. IF she tells him what you said he now has the opportunity to either change his plan or change his tactics. So now IF she continues to see him when she starts telling you that she has changed her mind on college/career he will have already primed her on how to respond to you, OP.", "Nta you voiced your concerns, but beyond that she has to make her own choices.

When my niece was 20 she married a bum kid,  18, no job,  quit school in grade 8,  no drivers license,  just played video games.   She proudly announced she would support him and he could be the house husband.   We tried warning her then bit out tongues.\n\n5 years later  she left him (for another guy) had PTSD from his abuse and being a bum..  she went kind of nuts, changed her identity, legally changed her name and went off the radar.

But this current sitch is no bueno.\n\nWho at 36 has anything in common with a 21 year old college student, enough to be in a relationship with them?

But a lot of growth and maturation happens between 21 and 26; the chance of a 15-year-gap relationship actually working OK are a lot better then.", "Sure, there are mature 26 year olds, but people are generally wildly different individuals at 26 and like 31, yet alone 41. I know I was, as well as all of my friends.\n\nImo, until you approach your 30s, even small age gaps can be quite different stages in life. I\u2019m 32 and 26 feels too young for me to the point where I wouldn\u2019t really consider that my dating pool, and almost everyone I meet around that age still feels like a post grad young adult.\n\nGranted, mileage will differ in different cultures and areas. In major US cities though, a 26 year old comes across as really young."]}
