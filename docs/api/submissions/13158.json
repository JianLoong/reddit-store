OP said their piece, but unfortunately they can't make sister listen and remove the rose colored glasses.

You see the red flags and so does she but like many in love she's ignoring them.

And it was hard. I tried to just be an ear to listen whenever she needed to complain and only offer solicited advice but our parents were constantly critical of him and told her he wasn\u2019t right for her and it just made her incredibly upset every time. They were right but she wasn\u2019t ready to hear it. It\u2019s frustrating to watch because there\u2019s no easy way to get her to see how bad of a situation she\u2019s in without also just making her upset and pushing her away.

If you say something negative about the guy you run the risk of the situation you\u2019re in now.  If you say something positive you can get blamed when she stays with him too long.  Secondly it sounds from your post that she already knows he\u2019s that way so your pointing it out wouldn\u2019t help her anyway.  If you\u2019re going to voluntarily walk in a mine field you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when one of the mines blows up in your face.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.  Abusers are really good at what they do, and your sister isn't able to see it yet.  You won't be able to convince her, especially if he's already poisoning the well against you and trying to isolate her from her family.  Trying to push the issue will only drive her further into his arms.\n\nSo, you have a few options.\n\n1. Please set and defend your own boundaries.  Watching someone you love go through the abuse cycle can be traumatizing in itself.  Don't give more than you can so that when or if she's ready to leave, you haven't burnt yourself out.  It is okay to say, \"I'm just not a huge fan of your boyfriend, can we hang out and talk about other things?\" or \"I'd prefer to just hang out with you, I'm not really comfortable with your boyfriend and I don't want things to get weird.\"\n2. Consistently name behaviors without trying to convince her you're right or putting too much heat in it.  Small disgusted faces if she tells you something he did that was harmful to her and maybe a small, \"I don't like that,\" or \"I don't like that he is hurting you like that.\"  Just going, \\*wince\\* \"That sounds really controlling,\" and uncomfortably changing the subject will go a lot further than trying to make her see the light.\n3. Keep abuse resources at your fingertips (I recommend http://www.tnlr.org/en/).  If or when she asks for help, you can send her to resources that won't further harm her.  DO NOT suggest couples counseling or that he get therapy.  Both can exacerbate abuse.\n4. If he does do gross things in front of you in the future, speak up in that moment, but be prepared for him to launch an all-out assault and make it seem like you're making a scene or being an AH for confronting him.  Stay calm and do your best to let him hang himself with his AH behavior.  Set firm and clear boundaries and don't match his heat.  It doesn't always have to be a direct challenge, either.  Just an \"ew\" face and immediately changing the subject sometimes does the trick.  Sometimes it can become clearer to the victim that their abuser is clearly being an AH if the other person doesn't get swept up in the drama, but keeps making it clear that he isn't acting okay.\n5. Get your own support/therapy/confidant for this.  You can do everything right and she could still stay with him for a very long time until it gets really bad.  You can't fix this for her.  She has to be able to see it and want to leave.\n\nMight I be going overboard jumping straight to abuse?  I hope I am.  The patterns you've laid out are pretty suspicious to me though, and definitely CAN set her up for horrific abuse later.", "NTA", "NTA.
