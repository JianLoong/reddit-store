OP said their piece, but unfortunately they can't make sister listen and remove the rose colored glasses.

You see the red flags and so does she but like many in love she's ignoring them.

Odds ar, you wont ever be in a lasting relationship or a marriage that both parties are happy in. In the process of demonising feminine qualities, you simultaneously take away one of your most beautiful quality's from a mans perspective, your femininity (which this womans sister obviously has and is the reason that man will probably invest in that relationship/future marriage). \nFeminism has demonised the word submission and portrayed it as oppression when it's simply a quality of being feminine and following the lead a man is expected to give. If you want a masculine man who's willing to take care of you than be prepared for that man to expect a feminine woman. \nNot all of you want that and that's cool, just expect an emasculated man who will submit to you the moment you feel conflicted and raise your voice at him.

Abusers are really good at what they do, and your sister isn't able to see it yet.  You won't be able to convince her, especially if he's already poisoning the well against you and trying to isolate her from her family.  Trying to push the issue will only drive her further into his arms.\n\nSo, you have a few options.\n\n1. Please set and defend your own boundaries.  Watching someone you love go through the abuse cycle can be traumatizing in itself.  Don't give more than you can so that when or if she's ready to leave, you haven't burnt yourself out.  It is okay to say, \"I'm just not a huge fan of your boyfriend, can we hang out and talk about other things?\" or \"I'd prefer to just hang out with you, I'm not really comfortable with your boyfriend and I don't want things to get weird.\"\n2. Consistently name behaviors without trying to convince her you're right or putting too much heat in it.  Small disgusted faces if she tells you something he did that was harmful to her and maybe a small, \"I don't like that,\" or \"I don't like that he is hurting you like that.\"  Just going, \\*wince\\* \"That sounds really controlling,\" and uncomfortably changing the subject will go a lot further than trying to make her see the light.\n3. Keep abuse resources at your fingertips (I recommend http://www.tnlr.org/en/).  If or when she asks for help, you can send her to resources that won't further harm her.  DO NOT suggest couples counseling or that he get therapy.  Both can exacerbate abuse.\n4. If he does do gross things in front of you in the future, speak up in that moment, but be prepared for him to launch an all-out assault and make it seem like you're making a scene or being an AH for confronting him.  Stay calm and do your best to let him hang himself with his AH behavior.  Set firm and clear boundaries and don't match his heat.  It doesn't always have to be a direct challenge, either.  Just an \"ew\" face and immediately changing the subject sometimes does the trick.  Sometimes it can become clearer to the victim that their abuser is clearly being an AH if the other person doesn't get swept up in the drama, but keeps making it clear that he isn't acting okay.\n5. Get your own support/therapy/confidant for this.  You can do everything right and she could still stay with him for a very long time until it gets really bad.  You can't fix this for her.  She has to be able to see it and want to leave.\n\nMight I be going overboard jumping straight to abuse?  I hope I am.

The implication is women don\u2019t deserve equal pay and treatment because they don\u2019t fight in a war.\n\n> women want the rights but are happy to pass on the responsibilities\n\nThis again implies that there\u2019s something wrong with this. Wanting rights should not be contingent on responsibilities. That\u2019s not how it works. It\u2019s also the obvious progression: why would women fight for the right to fight in a war when they\u2019re considered a man\u2019s property? Responsibilities will always come later, an oppressed group isn\u2019t going to fight for the right to be even worse off.\n\nWhen it comes to war this also ignores a lot of the nuance. Each citizen has a duty to their family and to their country. If you don\u2019t want to have orphans, someone needs to go with your children. In a lot of scenarios it simply makes sense that women take that role while men fight - men are generally physically better at fighting. This has no impact on one\u2019s deserving of rights though.\n\nThis also doesn\u2019t consider the fact that women are far more likely to be brutalized by men and what you are asking of women to stay is a lot different than men.

I've always known her to be interested in younger men but that's not because my mom is a sugar momma. My mom is just a very young spirited and active person. Even though she has the maturity and wisdom of a 50 year old woman, she lives like she's 30. She just finds that she has little in common with men her age because in her own words \"They act like they're old. I might be 50 but I'm not old\". Her long term boyfriend is 30, they're 20 years apart but I feel like I rarely notice the age difference. They're a perfect match for each other and I've never seen my mom so happy.\n\nOn the other hand, I remember being 17 and dating a 21 year old. I thought I was so cool and so \"mature\". Low and behold, the joke was on me. It took some growing up to realize that the guys my age weren't \"too dumb and immature for me\" but we were equally young and dumb. I was so easily impressed at 17 that I thought having an apartment and car meant someone was mature and that I must of been really awesome for them to show interest in me. In reality, he was a big loser and I was a fool. Now at 22 I couldn't imagine dating someone that young.
