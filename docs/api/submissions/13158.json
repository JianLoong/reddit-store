How could she not? She's just choosing to ignore it.", "NTA. Sounds like your sister needs an outside perspective, and you gave it. Good for you.\n\nKeep reaching out to her, even though she isn't ready to talk yet. She will be someday, hopefully soon, and she may need her support system to get her out of a bad situation.", "NTA.

She's obviously more shallow than you and will have to figure out for herself whether the money and lifestyle is worth living with a jerk.", "NTA you\u2019re trying to protect her, but she clearly doesn\u2019t want to hear it. You did your duties to warn her and only she can make the decision on how to proceed next.", "NTA\n\nHe belongs to an older generation than her. She should wait for her brain to finish growing before making this decision ( why is the Ukraine/war comment funny to anyone)\n\nI would\u2019ve had the same concerns.", "NTA\n\nBut unfortunately you can't force her to see the red flags through rose colored glasses. She's seen some but brushed them off because this is new and exciting and she's *in love* in that \"honeymoon\" phase.\n\nRemember that whatever happens, you did try to raise your concerns. Don't push it or you may lose your sister, but if she comes to you later about issues with him don't throw it in her face. Be supportive.", "NTA\n\nSorry to break it to you OP, but the mental manipulation of the narcissist your sister is dating is already complete. She went from working really hard to get into law school to \u201cyou\u2019re just jealous because I found someone successful and good looking, and who is going to take care of me!\u201d, a complete 180 of where she was just three months ago. What\u2019s going to happen next is this man is going to convince her that you and the rest of your family \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to see her happy\u201d, and start turning her against all of you, especially you. She\u2019s most likely not going to return your calls or see you. You\u2019re probably gonna find out some time later she\u2019s pregnant, and has dropped out of law school. We all have seen this story before, and sadly\u2026.. we also know how this sometimes ends.", "NTA. You did the right thing. It sounds like she is in love with  the idea of him. Hopefully that will fade as he shows his true colors.", "NTA, you did your sisterly duty and warned her.", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s very easy for people to say \u201cyou\u2019re jealous\u201d when something they do is criticized. It\u2019s not always jealousy, sometimes it\u2019s concern.  \n\nIf possible remind her of the things he has said \u201cremember when he talked about the Ukrainian women?  Were you okay with his comment?\u201d  And if she says she wasn\u2019t ask her why she didn\u2019t say anything. Because I guarantee it\u2019s because she knew it would cause a fight. \n\nTell her there are more important things in life than finding a good looking man.  Finding a decent one for example and remind her she\u2019s worth more than that", "INFO: are you in an area with reproductive freedom and choice?

Be prepared to be there fpr your sister when she comes to terms with the nature of her relationship.", "NAH - nothing wrong with telling her your opinion on her boyfriend, although calling out the hypocrisy of women demanding equality but not being willing to equally fight and die for the defense of their country does not make one a mysoginist.\n\nShe is an adult and responsible for her own decisions however so if she loves him or just wants to have a go at being a golddigger don't expect her to follow your advice. Especially if you're being as preachy about it as it sounds here and especially if that advice is centered around him potentially trying to stop her studying law, which is nothing but an assumption you are making about what possibly might happen that you present as an inevitability even though it isn't.", "NTA. Your sister is a Golddigger, and that dude is fucking creepy. They both need to he told off here", "NTA. Careful though. He'll probably try to isolate her. It'll be way easier for him to do that if you're fighting.", "Jees. Sounds like you're over reacting", "NTA.  OP said their piece, but unfortunately they can't make sister listen and remove the rose colored glasses.  Sounds like she's internalized some part of this relationship with this AH as elevating herself (his \"success\", his \"maturity \", being taken of like a child, whatever) and that will be hard to break if she doesn't want to see it.  Best you can do is let her know you'll be there when she does.", "NTA, sounds like hes trying to groom her", "NTA.  You sound concerned and I applaud you for that.  Maybe reach out with a softer tone and tell her you are just concerned for her and you just want her to think about the things you said and you want to just be supportive of her.  She will make her own decisions.\n\nOn a side note, I'm not sure I agree that it's \"only natural\" for her to dress revealing because of her age.  She can dress any way she wants, regardless of age.  Just sayin.", "NTA but this is a minefield so tread very carefully. You see the red flags and so does she but like many in love she's ignoring them. You will have to change your approach with her going forward of not so much telling her to pull her head out of the sand but as concerns about her future plans for school, her career, kids, etc. The more you try to force her to break up the faster and further you're driving her into his arms.", "NTA. I\u2019d be speaking up to my sister if she were in this situation too. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to hear the truth and I\u2019m sure she already knows this which is why she got defensive. Just support her in any way you can, hopefully this will be short lived", "NTA.", "NTA. She knows,  but she also likes the size of his wallet., snd I bet he promises to \"take care of her\" . Men (barely) of her age wont promise that. \nShes flattered. She probably thinks shes got all the life/love/money problems solved with this guy,  or at least that'what she's telling herself atm\n She's only 21 snd was single for a year. Bear in mind that her previous boyfriends would have been teenagers/ college kids. Just support her and wait.

Unless he starts hitting her, the ball's in her court now, and only your sister can save herself.", "NTA. You said this from a place of concern. Little does your sister realize, but \u201cbeing taken care of\u201d is literaly a jail sentence. Her life will be dictated by her BF, and it will never be her own. Independence is self preservation, and unfortunately, she is too young to recognize it. Be there to support her, don\u2019t say another bad word against BF (otherwise he will move to isolate her), and hope for the best. Let her know you support her unconditionally. Good luck to all of you!", "NTA. I\u2019d buy her a copy of Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft. If she\u2019s not concerned about recognizing any of her boyfriend\u2019s behavior patterns in the definitive book about abusive and controlling behavior, then she should not be afraid to read it.", "She just doesn't want to face it yet.", "It\u2019s true. He could very well want her to work and give him al the money.", "Agree , it\u2019s really the only option..", "Fuck no. He's a creeper and she's an immature young adult who just got to the drinking age. His manipulation isn't her fault and it's clear he knows what he's doing.
