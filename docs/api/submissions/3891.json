Nicole on multiple occasions has made rude comments to me that she has justified by saying she is \u201cmore spiritually mature\u201d than I, and that if I explored more scripture I wouldn\u2019t be hurt. She made a point to notify the entire family, inclusive of grandparents, that my fianc\u00e9 and I had sex before marriage and advised us she is \u201cworried about his soul\u201d and how I am corrupting him. My fianc\u00e9 was not a virgin before we were together. \n\nRecently, Nicole claimed she wanted to \u201cpatch things up\u201d after months of low contact between us. She drove several hours to discuss in person. While I am upset about the things that have transpired, I was open to speaking with her about it, because I don\u2019t want to deal with this forever.\n\nAs soon as I sat down at the restaurant to talk, she says she only came to speak with me but figured she had to speak to her brother too. I asked what she meant by this and she says \u201cwell I assumed you were waiting on things to be patched up between us before you asked me to be in the wedding\u201d. I let her know that I was not planning on asking her to be a bridesmaid because I did not feel we were in a place in our relationship for that. She said she finds that extremely disrespectful and that she had her sisters-in-law in her wedding. I said \u201cwell that was very kind of you to make that choice, unfortunately we have decided against that for our wedding\u201d. I did let her know, that if things change between us before the wedding I would consider this. She did not speak to me the remainder of the time. \n\nBy the time they leave to head back home, Mary let me know Nicole had said \u201cI just wish he would marry LITERALLY anyone else\u201d. Among other comments of course too\u2026 My fianc\u00e9 had a phone conversation about this with Nicole letting her know this was a decision we came to together, and was not something I decided without consulting him.

Thanks so much for your thoughts :)", "NTA!!!! And don't look back.", "NTA keep your boundaries tight. She hasn\u2019t made an effort with you.", "You KNOW her.  Why would you invite her disdain of you on YOUR DAY?  NTA, and keep letting your soon to be hubs handle his pissy sister.", "DO NOT! I repeat, DO NOT leave your wedding dress or anything of importance for your wedding ANYWHERE she maybe even be able to slightly get her hands on it. If she tried to sabotage your relationship, she will absolutely try and sabotage your wedding", "Everyone sucks here", "NTA  I wouldn't have her at my wedding under the same circumstances either.\n\nWhat are your inlaws like overall.  Is it just Nicole that's the AH or does that extend to your PIL as well?  If it does and your fiance is up for it... elope.  Or just have a very small ceremony with the people you most care about and support you.  And just forgo the big wedding altogether.", "You're definitely NTA. Jesus Christ.", "NTA. I would not even let her come to the wedding! No telling what kind of scene she will cause. And if you plan to allow her in your home post-wedding, I would let her know that you expect her to be cordial and respectful or she will be getting removed.", ">well I assumed you were waiting on things to be patched up between us before you asked me to be in the wedding\n\nWell I only ask people who like me to be in the bridal party,  perhaps [fiancee]  could make you a groomswoman?\n\nNTA\n\nWhere has this come from that relatives of the groom expect to be in the bridal party?\n\nHonestly i would have told her \"at this point she is closer to losing guest status than becoming a bridesmaid. \"", "NTA.", "I hate it when people think they are spiritually mature and they don\u2019t even know they aren\u2019t actually aligned with those values. I just wish Jesus would pop in and point this out to them because it must make Him so mad that people do this.  \n\nNot only are you NTA, I would disinvite her altogether. I would let his parents know that while you value family you will not be made to feel badly on your wedding day. That your SIL has been repeatedly out of line and rude and openly declared she objects to the marriage. As this is the case not only is she not the invited to it, but you guys will be NC with her as a result of her antics. You hope they understand this decision made by both of you and still want to come. If not, you understand and they will be missed.", "It's \"Christians\" like these that have turned me off organized religion. NTA.", "I can see why she doesn\u2019t have many friends..", "No joke!  I know that sentiment all too well!", "One of the things most Christians seem to like to ignore (I'm talking generally) is that in God's eyes, all sin is weighted equally...it's human nature, not God's nature, to say that their sin is worse than my sin.\n\nI lived with my husband before marriage. I sin daily (I'm not proud, just realistic) and I recognise that we are called to love and not judge (\"Love they neighbour\" \"judge not lest the be judged\"). I'm going to be honest, I don't know much about the churches and denominations in America, but the ones I have seen and come into brief contact with all seem very much surface deep and immature. I know there are others because I have met Christians from America that aren't that way...and yes in the UK we have the nuttier Versions too...I just don't find their stance very ChristLike.\n\nYou're NTA. She needs to look past the word of scripture and embrace it into her life spiritually...Jesus never placed himself on a pedestal, he spent time with sinners and washed their feet. He did not judge them. \n\n(I also work for a church...Christians do Christ a disservice when they focus on judgement...that's not our role)", ">because she has read more scripture than OP\n\nShe obviously hasn't understood it. Pretty sure the instruction was not \"judge others, because you are surely prefect and have the right to do that\"", "Yeah I don't know much about it ae I'm not any religion and my atheist parents came from. Hindu upbringing but if I did know about a religion someone was being hypocritical about I'd use that as my rebuttal", "NTA it\u2019s overwhelming how offensive future SIL is.  She\u2019s the religious gate keeper for the family/heaven here? Yet she keeps desperate to be a bridesmaid too, so odd.  She seems to be missing any logical emotional intelligence and is ignorant on social norms.  She\u2019s a bully. Your fianc\u00e9 should have the equivalent of a high electrified fence to protect his life and you his sister, especially after the first offense.  She never made any sort of apology.   \n\nWould you buy a house next to someone like her? Would you even rent? That person is a nightmare.  Marinara flags on this marriage.", "NTA. Honestly, if it was me, I'd give some serious consideration to eloping, or something.", "This sounds like my wedding all over again\u2026my sister in law told me that she wished her brother was marrying his ex and not me\u2026so he kicked her out of wedding party and she made a big deal about it. She sounds like an entitled prick, if she\u2019s being hateful and negative don\u2019t feel bad. She doesn\u2019t support the relationship so why include her especially if your fianc\u00e9 feels the same way..NTA", "NTA. One toxic SIL. You're wedding your choice. I'd stay away from her. Blood don't make family. love and respect", "I and my SIL do not speak!! If for some reason she is gonna be around we don\u2019t bother going. I avoid her like the plague. May I suggest you do the same, because trust me it only gets worse when children are in the picture. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m impressed that you even want it at the wedding at all.", "NTA. You ask your closest friends and family to be a part of the wedding party. People who will support the marriage. Nicole will not.", "Nicole sounds insufferable. She's lucky to be getting an invitation with her crappy holier than thou attitude. NTA. Definitely keep her on low contact.", "I bet she's realised her christian friends will ask why she's not a bridesmaid. It's clearly all about appearing to live by christian values, not actually doing it. NTA OP", "Apparently needs to be the center of attention?  I don\u2019t know.  People are unreal.", "Just remind her that Adam and Eve weren't married either......they were \"partners and helpmate\" according to the good book.  So they lived together in \"sin\" according to her definition!", "Tell her it\u2019s not middle school and you don\u2019t need  a chaperone", "NTA: make sure you hav your dress and rings closely watched", "You would be an idiot if you let her and I don't know why you're even asking this. Nta", "Nta and omg she sounds soooo awful", "NTA I wouldn't even invite her to the wedding", " NTA and honestly I wouldn't even invite her to the wedding if she's so against it she can stand outside and hand out religious literature, burn books, yell at random dogs or whatever it is crazy people do.", "You\u2019d be a dope to invite her, apart from not having her be a bridesmaid. \n\nNTA", "That's literally Christianity since the council of nicaea circa 315ish ad", "Same"]}
