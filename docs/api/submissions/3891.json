Even before my fianc\u00e9 and I were together, she had never liked me and made multiple comments about this. Once my fianc\u00e9 and I were together, things got a lot worse. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is incredibly religious, which I can admire, but this is important context. Nicole on multiple occasions has made rude comments to me that she has justified by saying she is \u201cmore spiritually mature\u201d than I, and that if I explored more scripture I wouldn\u2019t be hurt. She made a point to notify the entire family, inclusive of grandparents, that my fianc\u00e9 and I had sex before marriage and advised us she is \u201cworried about his soul\u201d and how I am corrupting him. My fianc\u00e9 was not a virgin before we were together. \n\nRecently, Nicole claimed she wanted to \u201cpatch things up\u201d after months of low contact between us. She drove several hours to discuss in person. While I am upset about the things that have transpired, I was open to speaking with her about it, because I don\u2019t want to deal with this forever.\n\nAs soon as I sat down at the restaurant to talk, she says she only came to speak with me but figured she had to speak to her brother too. I asked what she meant by this and she says \u201cwell I assumed you were waiting on things to be patched up between us before you asked me to be in the wedding\u201d. I let her know that I was not planning on asking her to be a bridesmaid because I did not feel we were in a place in our relationship for that. She said she finds that extremely disrespectful and that she had her sisters-in-law in her wedding. I said \u201cwell that was very kind of you to make that choice, unfortunately we have decided against that for our wedding\u201d. I did let her know, that if things change between us before the wedding I would consider this. She did not speak to me the remainder of the time. \n\nBy the time they leave to head back home, Mary let me know Nicole had said \u201cI just wish he would marry LITERALLY anyone else\u201d. Among other comments of course too\u2026 My fianc\u00e9 had a phone conversation about this with Nicole letting her know this was a decision we came to together, and was not something I decided without consulting him. To which she responded, \u201cyou are my BLOOD brother and I am here forever. From what I have seen this past weekend, she will not be!\u201d. He says \u201cwell if you do not think we will work out, why would you want to attend our wedding at all?\u201d She says \u201cbecause then you will finally be making the right choice and not living in sin.\u201d She was referring to him and I living together before marriage.

Personally i would go a step further and ban her from the wedding and my life. Why is it always the religious people doing this bullshit?", "NTA.

You're under no obligation to make her a bridesmaid, and in fact it could be seen as nice of you not to make her join your bridal party, you know, since she doesn't support your marriage and all.
