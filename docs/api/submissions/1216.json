I have 2 kids,  a 11 year old son and 8 year old daughter.  My son went trick or treating with his friend in his friends neighborhood but my wife and I took our daughter in our neighborhood.  \n\nThere's this house that's sorta across the street from us.  They're nice enough people but really religious.  I wouldn't care except they push their religion.  They invite neighbors to events,  hand out pamphlets and other stuff.   They're not jehovah witness but pretty close by how pushy they are. \n\nA few years back the dad invited me to a church event.  I almost went. We go to church but I thought it'd be interesting to see how someone else does things. Then I was talking to another neighbor and he said \"DON'T GO\". I guess he went to one and they invited him to join the men and play cards or something in the basement,  then proceeded to debate with him about their religion vs his and wouldn't let him leave (his words). \n\nComing after adults is one thing, but they've also sent they're kids over to hand out pamphlets to my kids a few times when they were playing outside.   My son had no interest but the pamphlets talked about a summer/day camp thing and made it sound fun. My daughter kinda wanted to go but I didn't trust it.  They're not brainwashing my kids. Hell, I won't even make them go to church if they decide they don't want to I'm not letting someone else make them feel bad for not belonging to their religion.  \n\nLast Halloween that house had their kids sitting outside giving something out. Of course a pamphlet.  \n\nSo back to trick or treating this year.  We went up our side of the block then across the street. When we were approaching that house I told my daughter \"just go to the next house they don't give out candy here anyway\". I even said I'd race her to the next house to distract her.\n\nLater my wife said that it was stupid for me to tell my daughter to skip a house because they don't give out candy. That I'm teaching her to be greedy. \n\nI said that her and I both knew it wasn't about the candy but I'm  sick of them being so pushy about their religion, and using their kids to do it. I mean the parents weren't even outside with them it was the kids, and it was the kids that ran over with pamphlets when my kids were outside playing.  \n\nWife said it's not the kids fault and I probably made them feel bad that their home schooled so probably don't get to talk to many other kids and now think daughter doesn't like them, we should have just gotten it and tossed it when we got home. \n\nAITA for telling my daughter to skip a house?  I can see my wife's side, but I kinda feel like it's the parents own fault.  I don't answer  my door for jehovah witnesses either so...", "created_utc": 1667578912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym3atv/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_skip_a_house/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We knew that a home that was decorated was probably  a good home versus one that had no decorations. We didn\u2019t trick or prank anyone but we also didn\u2019t waste our limited time", "I have a Jehovahs Witness family member (used to have a few, but the others have died now). I grew up around the fringes of their faith, so I know a lot of JWs and most of them never stop with the conversion attempts. I don't blame you for trying to keep away from your neighbours and you are NTA for doing that. They sound as though they employ similar tactics.\n\nMy remaining JW family member is someone very close to me and I love them to bits, but we did end up having a serious row over some very hurtful things they said to me when proselytising. We now have an agreement that in order to preserve our relationship, they will never attempt to discuss religion at all with me, my husband or our son.", "NTA -not your job to prioritize some other kids MAYBE feeling lonely over keeping your own kids away from a cult. \n\nHad something similar happen as a kid - toward the end of a school day one day in elementary school we all got taken to this sort of mini \u201cfun fair\u201d type thing with some fun stuff to do set up outside in a yard and at the end they gathered us all up and were asking if we went to church, which ones, etc. and we\u2019re taking down our names and phone numbers and stuff on a list. My mom heard about it when she went to pick me up and got PISSED. She went over and confronted them and got our info removed. \n\nI was pretty young so I don\u2019t remember/didn\u2019t know what went on behind the scenes - if the school knew this was gonna be a religious thing at all, if anyone got in trouble, whatever. Appalachia, man.", "NTA.  I would ask your wife is she really thinks it is a good idea to introduce your eight year-old to a cult.", "NTA - Halloween is about candy. that's the whole thing behind trick or treating. I made my 4yo skip houses I felt where just down right sketchy. (One required kids to go into the back yard).. So no, you're not the asshole for protecting your kids from religious zealots that are pushing material on a non-religious holiday", "NTA\n\nYour kids are *trick-or-treating*, not paying calls. If a house has no candy and no other attraction (like a haunted house setup), there's no obligation to visit. It's not greedy\u2014at least, not any *more* greedy than the holiday already entails. \n\nIt would have been NAH but for your wife calling you stupid; that was uncalled for.", "It's usual for people to have differences of opinion.   But calling your husband stupid seems inappropriate.   Also the suggestion that your statement about no candy would be teaching your child to be greedy is a long stretch.   IMO the no candy remark is just making the change of plan acceptable to the child.   Memory in a child for this kind of information is until the next fun thing that happens.  Perhaps no one is an asshole here.  But, wife is coming awfully close.", "NTA. If your wife thinks they are so dandy, why doesn't she visit them? Go over with a coffee cake and spend a couple hour listening to them about their religion? \n\nSkipping a house that only interacts with people to try to convert them to their religion is completely reasonable.", "NTA - The want to be the pushy family, religion, golf, doesn't matter, if you are PUSHY you are an AH and people tend to avoid you, so you did what any reasonable normal adult would do. Your wife is wrong on this one.", "NTA - you did the right thing to protect YOUR kids. Yeah I feel sorry for those kids, but that\u2019s a case of \u201cnot my circus not my monkeys\u201d.", "NAH.\n\nIMO 8yo kids should not have to deal with religious pamphlets in the middle of trick or treating.  They've been neighbors for several years, so if your kids and their kids aren't friends already, they aren't going to be.\n\nThe difference here between you and your wife is really just a matter of style. What is polite vs. rude, or real vs. fake.", "NTA \n\n\"Teaching her to be greedy\"? It's a night of literally ringing on dozens of doorbells and straight up asking/expecting people to give you candy. These neighbors are choosing not to participate in this...so don't participate with them."]}
