We have taken action to resolve the situation, and he is no longer employed with us.\" Or something similar from said bank, I will believe it. \n\nOP's claims about the employee's behavior are simply not believable. For someone who works at a bank to risk their (probably well-paying) job (in this economy???) it would take a lot more than \"You're lazy.\" Either OP was a lot more inflammatory than he's letting on, or he's cooking up the worst possible ways to prove the teller was somehow wrong for being offended by personal insults. \n\n Source: Again. I've worked for a bank for 2 years. I've never seen a colleague act like this, not even my bipolar one who's secretly doing benders on her days off so she can't take her meds.\n\nEdit. Have a little compassion for the working class. Please tell me how you would enjoy it if your clients started telling you how to do your own job. Even if they're right. Would you like to be criticized and berated by the people you're getting paid to help all the time? Just because it's your job does NOT mean you have to tolerate being treated as less than human. If you are anything but polite to someone who is serving you and being paid to do so, you're TA. Simple as that.\n\nAnother edit. You all fail to notice how OP doesn't mention anything about the employee being impolite until he insults said employee. I can promise you we demarket (freeze and close) all your accounts if you treat staff with disrespect. If you can't understand that it's just a job for us, and we are not a personification of the poor banking services the company we work under provides, you need to start keeping your money in your mattress. Bank tellers aren't there to deal with your BS. And you aren't there to make a new friend, so stop expecting them to kiss your ass. If you provoke an employee and then hold it against them that they can't be provoked at their job, you are TA.", "It seems your entire argument is \"I work in a bank and haven't seen this therefore OP is lying\"."]}
