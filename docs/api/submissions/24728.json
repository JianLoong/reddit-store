Theres a lot that needs to be done at the end of the day - counting drawers, batching transactions, counting vaults, etc etc etc. its nice to be able to get it started early so youre not there longer than you have to be.\n\nBUT\n\n\u2026I would never be so dumb as to say that to a customer out loud. Thats ridiculous. Its not like you showed up at 4:58 (which has happened). You were gone with 15min to spare", "Tell him some big banks are closing branches around the country due to little customer traffic. If he is now accustomed to closing early it suggests his branch isn\u2019t do busy.  Maybe he will soon have lots of free time.", "YTA ... How do you get off calling someone lazy when you've never done their job a day in your life? You can assume what it's like but you don't know for certain. Of all the things you could have said that was completely inappropriate considering the circumstances.", "NTA. I would be furious, like, find-a-new-bank-furious, if I showed up at 4:55 to find the bank closed. Sometimes I am legally required to make a deposit right away.", "I\u2019m not a let-me-speak-to-your-manager type but if someone calls me an a$$40!3 for making them do their job then I would be speaking with his manager. \n\nNTA I\u2019ve been working since I was 14, I do understand.", "NTA. They call them banker\u2019s hours for a reason.", "NTA. Fuck \"bankers hours\". A bank is there to serve the customers. We all don't have the luxury of showing up before 5.", "YTA. You don't know they're closing procedure and how long it takes but the laziness comment was unwarranted.", "INFO\n\nWhere were the hours in question posted? Google, or at the bank itself? Please keep in mind that because of COVID, a lot of businesses still have fucked up operating hours on Google or their websites, because they haven't updated them after the change. Lots of places close 30mins earlier now. \n\nIt's not like the employee asked you to leave when you came in. He serviced you and then politely asked that you respect the hours of the business next time (whether he was right or not.) That doesn't warrant you calling him lazy- because he was not. He served your ungrateful self. \n\nWas this the branch manager or assistant manager? I work for a bank. Normally, it's one of those two who closes up shop. In which case, they're allowed to decide when and if they close early to get their paperwork done. \n\nShould he have called you an asshole? No. But you should not have commented on his work ethic unprovoked, either, when he hadn't shown any signs of *actually* being lazy. You felt personally attacked by him establishing a request, and decided to say something back. \n\nAny employee of any store is allowed to ask a client to leave if they're treated the way you treated that employee. Please be mindful. You're the one who escalated this. The hours of the bank are irrelevant.", "NTA. Their hours are their hours. These are the hours the public can come in and do all the transactions offered by a bank. \n\nNow if you had asked to begin consultation about a loan at 4:59, that would be a different matter, and AH-ish. Although TECHNICALLY they should still put the customer first and even honor THAT, since they are a BUSINESS whose job is to SERVE THE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.\n\nNot only was the employee rude to expect a customer to not come in at 4:30, he was extremely out of line by saying what he said, and quite frankly should be reported to upper management. Lazy, entitled person who doesn't appreciate what he has (a JOB, for which he probably gets paid too much to do very little.)", "NTA.\n\nso what happens if they close early at 430pm\n\nthen a customer thinking banking hours was til 5pm tries to walk in?\n\nbusiness is about stability ... changing banking hours at will is not good business", "NTA it\u2019s illegal where I am from to close a bank early or open early. There are government regulations that are strictly adhered too. Might want to look up if you have something similar then report them to the head office.", "ESH\n\nCould've easily just said \"sure\" then next time go whenever even if it's 4:55.  They were being a dick and you wanted to argue/prove you're right.  It's just unnecessary and exhausting", "I guess he can just sit at home with no job from now on because calling customers AHs should absolutely get you fired.", "Ehh...mixed answer. NTA your opinion, and for what it's worth, I completely agree with your thinking. But YTA for the way you said it. There's a way to say things, and I think you kind of failed at your delivery. But I absolutely agree with your message.", "NTA.  I'd like to see what his manager would say if you told them you were moving your account due to this encounter.", "NTA and you should report that to a branch manager. Thats a crazy aggressive attitude for him to have. There's footage if every inch of that place, so a report can be corroborated.", "INFO: A complete stranger decided to call you an asshole over this?", "NTA He should have never have said that to you. As a former bank employee I can understand his thought process, but the SDB vault isn\u2019t supposed to be shut until after the bank is, since there\u2019s timers in it they have to check before closing the vault", "Nta. I would have been pissed if I had gone to make a deposit so I could pay a bill and they were closed half an hour early.", "NTA. You pay that bank for a service. You should expect to be able to use the bank during their posted business hours without complaining from a lazy staff member. After the way the employee insulted you and called you an AH, maybe the bank manager needs to be informed about the lack of professionalism of his or her employees.", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t have confronted him head on, just report him to manager and corporate.", "You\u2019ve never heard the term \u201cbanker\u2019s hours\u201d? They do not feel obligated to offer customers good service.", "This would have been the only thing to do. Engaging with him was pointless, but at least the is now a recording of the interaction on the security cameras. Immediately contact corporate to report the issue and the harassment, be specific about date and time and point out that they should review the footage.", "you don't get out much, huh?", "My bank is closed all the time when I roll through at 4:45 (I ask to be let off early on fridays sometimes to deposit my check before the bank closes at 5)", "Someones never worked such a job and it shows.\n\nWhen someones wage is that low and the task are that menial, people have no problems risking their job; they aren't really risking much.", "I too felt this was an interaction that may have happened \u201cinternally\u201d in the OPs brain\u2026", "Honestly the fact that it\u2019s such a pointless mundane encounter is what makes me think it happened haha", "I've worked at least one job where we tried to close up 30 minutes early every day. Coworkers were definitely miffed when someone came in around that time.\n\nI've also had employees of buisnessed I've been to express the same thing when I came in even an hour before closing.\n\nThis story isn't hard to believe at all.", "Yep that's more like it, I have a friend who works at the bank and this has happened to them before, as well as many coworkers they've spoken to. No way is this real.", "you're complaining about this story being made up while simultaneously making up facts to justify your verdict. peak reddit moment right here. why do people like you even read these post, much less comment? no one needs to read a million people comment about how they think a post is fake.", "I probably would feel the same but the same thing happened to me recently - was finished my transaction before five and still got scolded.  It was jarring.", "Lmao I\u2019ve been to banks which were closed half an hour before they said they would. Count yourself lucky you\u2019ve never had to experience this.", "NFH \n\n(Never fucking happened)", "Why would you need to rebalance the vault for a safety deposit box?", "She did leave before 5 though. She came in at 4:30 and was done at 4:45. She wasn't telling him to stay late. She was telling him to comply with the posted hours.", "Until the bank manager pulls up the security tape.", "Based", "[removed]", "That's the standard business model here in the UK. Branch closures are all the rage.", "Depends on the local laws, but yes they could.", "I've been working for a bank for 2 years. Clients like OP come in every day bitching about my colleagues. Doesn't make me believe them when they're being disrespectful and unkind. Makes me think they didn't get what they wanted last time and they're gonna throw a tantrum unless I put my foot down.\n\nEdit: OP commented something about how the employee should've bit his tongue and let him leave. Then says it's the employee's fault for starting the argument. Follows this up with a \"well if he wanted to leave early...\" as a gotcha moment. \n\nOP:\n\n- went to the bank \n- (we still don't have a concrete answer on whether or not it ACTUALLY closes at 4:30. OP is leaving this information out on purpose, probably)\n- bank employee served him (aka he did his job) \n- bank employee politely requested he come in earlier next time \n- OP feels like the employee is passive aggressively telling him to \"fuck off during my downtime\" or whatever \n- OP calls employee lazy for essentially doing his job (serving OP and then moving on. OP was the only customer around, as far as we know) \n- employee defends himself because now, OP has turned this into a verbal confrontation \n- OP comes onto the internet and complains about all this \n- OP blames the employee for starting the argument and convolutes the story to make him seem like less of an asshole \n- OP genuinely cannot handle rejection at all", "Five to ten years ago, I would agree. Not now. Any sense of work ethic has basically vanished in many sectors. OP is definitely not the AH.", "Lol OK. It's just Reddit. No need to be so upset about comments. Fact that you're upset about my comment, kinda leads me to believe you think I might be right.", "Working as a server, I agree. But for a bank, I disagree.", "My bank opens at 8:00 and closes at 1 p.m. After 1 p.m.  you can still enter the foyer to use the ATM or do other minimal transactions that you don't need an employee for.", "I was a bank teller in 2018 and they told us to encourage customers to use the ATMs for basic transactions. It was so they could justify only having 2 tellers working at a time.", "From OP's Post \" The bank in question closes at 5:00. \". So yes- according to their posted schedule, they close at 5pm.", "Thats like every post", "Its actually because the elderly need our help more than tech-savvy millennial, gen Zers and gen alphas who use online banking all the time and never need to call unless there's a fraud or a password reset to deal with. \n\nSenior clients take a lot more time and energy to explain things to. They're vulnerable to financial abuse, so often they're very paranoid and we have to spend a *lot*  of time reassuring them before they feel ready to leave. \n\nIf you can use the ATM, use the ATM. The tellers are for people who have a phobia of learning how to use technology.", "I don't think I'm taking OP's word of mouth alone on this. Human error happens. OP is asking if he's the asshole in the argument. That's what AITA is for. Considering he started it, (I promise I'm not in middle school), he is the likeliest candidate for TA *even if the bank hypothetically closes at 5pm and we have concrete evidence of this.*"]}
