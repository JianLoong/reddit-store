Why would someone risk their job on something so pointless? Nta i guess though", "NTA if a business is open until 5 and you\u2019re there and done with your stuff before 5, you did nothing wrong.

There's nothing worse than a customer turning up before closing after the kitchen is clean and ordering food, undoing the cleaning. \n\nBut this is a bank.

Half an hour before close is absolutely enough time to get through a bank transaction, especially since banks tend to close early anyway.

Because I guarantee you there's more to his job than just \"wait on customers,\" including some parts of it that happen after he's left his till for the day. You don't get to call him lazy or to tell him to do his job. It's not hard to get through a single 15-minute transaction without being a jackass to low-level employees.", "YTA for calling him lazy. \n\nNot wrong that you were within your rights to show up when you did, but you could have just said \u201cOk\u201d and walked out. \n\nDude obviously had a shitty day.", "ESH\n\nHis job is to be open until five; most workers understand that you work beyond closing times in order to clean and prep for the next day. \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to call him lazy. You were rude and entitled in that moment", "ESH.  it's rude to call people names.  that goes for both of you, you called him lazy, he called you an AH.  super unprofessional and inappropriate. \n\nhowever, you should take this up with the manager.  not your interaction with the employee, but how they were closing early.  just to clarify if they are allowed to do that.", "YTA. You in fact do not know what his job hours are. He could have been scheduled to work until 3 and was forced to stay late.
