I\u2019m confused as to why they are here and A says she invited them since they don\u2019t have family vacations often. Obviously I\u2019m upset I said no partners and she had the nerve to invite her family. I told her that this wasn\u2019t ok and we talked about this before we even booked the trip. She said they wouldn\u2019t be any trouble but who wants a girls trip with a 3 yr old and someone\u2019s partner? We all were going to brunch at 11 so I tried not to let this ruin my trip. We get to brunch and A and H are getting pretty drunk. I tried to tell them to slow down since they have there child with them. H said he was an adult and he didn\u2019t need me monitoring them. \n\nI ignored them for the rest of brunch and tried to have fun on the beach( we went after brunch) G threw sand all over me and T and threw a tantrum when we took the bucket of rocks he was throwing at us.When we got back to the Airbnb A & H went to sleep and left G awake he almost instantly started messing with things and broke a lamp. At that point we are all fed up. I wake G\u2019s parents up and an argument ensues. A says some pretty hurtful things that I told her about in private. I\u2019m so fed up and hurt that A and her family have ruined the trip I decided to leave I moved my flight and am now sitting in the airport waiting to board.

Honestly, you would have been in the right to be annoyed by A secretly inviting her husband, much less her husband and a small child that needs round the clock care. \n\nI have two small kids.

I hate when people unilaterally decide that these boundaries don\u2019t apply to them and their precious family. \n\nSorry to be blunt, but it doesn\u2019t sound like A & the twins respect you, your feelings, or the friendship.

You don\u2019t need to be around that. \n\nThis is gonna sound very judgemental of me, but I think it\u2019s disgusting that they were slamming back the alcohol while they had their 3yo there and they were clearly expecting everyone else to watch him. And going to sleep and just expecting him to be monitored. I feel bad for the kid. I\u2019m a parent myself so I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not allowed to let their hair down every now and then, but you don\u2019t both get hammered while your kid is with you, and bring your kid and your partner on a partner and kid free trip.", "NTA i would ask for my money back since it was stated and agreed before that it would be couple and children free trip, then they change that.

It sucks your vacation got ruined.", "A pays for your and T's spots since H and G essentially took those spots on the trip. \n\nI'd be a bit worried about damages since it's in your name, in hindsight, since it was under your name you'd be well within your rights to kick them out, using landlord if you had to.
