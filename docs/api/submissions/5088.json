And honestly with my job and taking care of the animals him and everything Else it\u2019s just been exhausting. \n\nHe constantly criticizes me while driving and is completely rude he calls me names and belittles me the entire time. He complains about my music and everything else he can think of. \n\nI have asked him over and over again to keep his mouth shut and if he wants to be rude he can find his own ride to work. This results in him saying he\u2019ll just quit and I can pay all the bills. \n\nLast week he was driving me absolute crazy. I haven\u2019t been getting any sleep cause he wakes me up constantly and refuses to let the dog out when she\u2019s not feeling good and he\u2019s awake and I\u2019m sleeping.\n\nI drove him to work and dropped him off to be criticized the entire time. I picked him up and the exact same thing happened. I stopped to get gas down the road from our house probably 5 minute drive 20/30 minute walk. \n\nHe ended up needing something and ran in and I drove off leaving him no other choice but to walk home. I got home and enjoyed my 20 minutes of piece and quiet before he got in and started calling me a selfish asshole for leaving and not telling him. \n\nHis mom was happy I stood up for myself while my disabled father staying with us called me selfish and over dramatic as well due to the fact it\u2019s freezing cold out and he was only wearing his work hoodie. \n\nSo Reddit I\u2019m coming to you for advice on wether I was the a hole in this situation or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No. Nta. He's gross", "ESH\n\nStranding someone is a dick move and you were an AH in that situation.  Your bf is an AH for having a job an hour away and expecting someone else to drive him, for belittling you and calling you names, and for assuming you would pay his bills if he lost his job.  All of those are red flags that would cause most people to examine whether this is a healthy, loving relationship.\n\nHe is abusing you.  Get out now before your entire life is ruined by this jackass.", "And looking at your last post it looks like this toxic relationship has been going on for at least six months..........I'm sorry but he sounds like a trash person. You need help. Leave his sorry ass", "NTA! I know you don\u2019t want relationship advice but it can\u2019t be separated from the issue you\u2019re worried about. The way he talks you is absolutely abuse. If you don\u2019t see it that way (yet) then you\u2019re going to have to continue asking yourself regularly if you\u2019re TA. And the majority of the time, you won\u2019t be.", "NTA- literally only read the first paragraph and passed judgement.", "ESH. Basing this solely on your edit. He\u2019s is too old to act the a petulant child. You need to grow up and accept your loser boyfriend will mentally and emotionally abuse you for so long as you stay with him. You dad, he\u2019s a mooch that needs to keep his mouth shut. You\u2019re all awful.", "When my husband was keeping me from sleeping, I noticed other things he did, realized he was abusive and left our marriage.  Leaving him at a gas station is mild.

But did you know that you can move out and he can pay his own bills like a grown man? \n\nSay what you like about \u201cchemistry\u201d - there is a very specific type of man who dates a woman almost half his age. He\u2019s also the kind of man who creates his own stressful situation (by doing something dumb like DUI) and then blames that stress when he acts like a d*ckhole to the person helping him.

A 37 year old that loses their license and has the gall to criticize the person sacrificing to get them where they need to go isn\u2019t long term relationship material\u2026 unless you want that relationship to mirror any one of several thousand country songs including lyrics such as \u201ctrailer\u201d, \u201cbeer\u201d, or \u201cwifebeater\u201d\u2026", "Nta and your edit made your situation worse", "Run... Just run. Chemistry be damned.", "Nta....you don't want advice but you really need to listen to everyone here telling you this relationship is abusive. Your dad defending him is an ah and probably where you got the idea that his behavior is OK. While YOU may not have been aware of HIS age, HE was at the very least aware that you were very young. You don't say how long you've been together but if it's years that makes it worse. Ages matter when one person is really young and the other much older because the younger person hasn't had enough life experience to realize they're being abused and older men want younger girls because they're easily controlled, manipulated, and mentally beaten down to accept how they're treated as normal and just obey. Calling you names, putting you down, insulting you, are all abusive actions. You are being abused and people are trying to help you here. You need to leave him AND your dad!!!!", "NTA and you know it, but what in God\u2019s name are you doing with this abusive alcoholic?", "Nta.   You are describing a classic abusive personality, and that\u2019s why everyone feels the need to comment about it.  You would be the ah if you stay with him.", "NTA but your age gap and relationship is why he disrespects you and your driving and threatens to quit work and make you pay bills lol please don\u2019t think there isn\u2019t a connection.

He is verbally and emotionally abusing you. This isn\u2019t love. This isn\u2019t a loving relationship. Please read over your words. He criticizes you, is rude, calls you names and belittles you.

He's 37, can't handle his drinking problems or his temper. He is using you and abusing you. And yes, the age gap is concerning because he knows a woman closer to his age wouldn't put up with this. And neither should you. What does he bring that's positive? Like he threatened to quit his job and make you support him? Also, chemistry doesn't mean crap. In fact he likely love bombed you in order to get you do what he wants. You need to throw the whole man out.  Also, your father taking your abusers side makes me wonder if he's also an abuser.", "YTA", "NTA but why are you with him?", "Doesn\u2019t really matter if YTA or not.

Especially when that someone has a drinking problem.  I've also been 37, and at 37 a 22 year old looks like they are barely not a child.\n\nPlease do not ignore the fact that this man is old enough to be your father.  Please do not ignore the fact that this man has a substance abuse issue and cannot drive because of it.

He got me a Christmas tree because he knew how much it meant to me with him not caring to much for the holidays. He got me a cat and a dog knowing how much I love animals. He helped me get my car. He pumps the gas for me when we\u2019re driving together. Puts oil in and checks the other fluids. He fills up the tires when they\u2019re low. He gets me Chinese food when I\u2019m having a bad day because he knows it\u2019s my favorite. He got me a heater for my side of the bed and a heated blanket because I said it was cold one time. He gets me soup when I\u2019m sick. Won\u2019t let me help him shovel because it\u2019s to cold for me to be out there to. Got me a new pillow because I was getting neck aches. Changed my tire when I got a flat even though it was rusted and took a hour and a half to get the tire off. He does stuff for me. He does make my life better. He does make me happy.
