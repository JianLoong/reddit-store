And honestly with my job and taking care of the animals him and everything Else it\u2019s just been exhausting. \n\nHe constantly criticizes me while driving and is completely rude he calls me names and belittles me the entire time. He complains about my music and everything else he can think of. \n\nI have asked him over and over again to keep his mouth shut and if he wants to be rude he can find his own ride to work. This results in him saying he\u2019ll just quit and I can pay all the bills. \n\nLast week he was driving me absolute crazy. I haven\u2019t been getting any sleep cause he wakes me up constantly and refuses to let the dog out when she\u2019s not feeling good and he\u2019s awake and I\u2019m sleeping.\n\nI drove him to work and dropped him off to be criticized the entire time. I picked him up and the exact same thing happened. I stopped to get gas down the road from our house probably 5 minute drive 20/30 minute walk. \n\nHe ended up needing something and ran in and I drove off leaving him no other choice but to walk home. I got home and enjoyed my 20 minutes of piece and quiet before he got in and started calling me a selfish asshole for leaving and not telling him. \n\nHis mom was happy I stood up for myself while my disabled father staying with us called me selfish and over dramatic as well due to the fact it\u2019s freezing cold out and he was only wearing his work hoodie. \n\nSo Reddit I\u2019m coming to you for advice on wether I was the a hole in this situation or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Are some of the chores that fall to you his domain (ie are the animals his but you do the work? Do you do his laundry? Do you clean up his messes?

He literally has nothing to offer you.", "NTA but you are being verbally and emotionally abused. Please listen to what everyone is saying to you. It is NOT normal for a significant other to belittle, yell at, and name-call their partner. That is abuse. Stress is not an excuse to abuse someone. It also sounds like he does not treat you as his equal in this relationship as you stated you have to take care of him and he doesn\u2019t help at all with the dog. The fact that he isn\u2019t always abusive, and is sometimes very loving, is a classic psychological tactic used by abusers to keep their partners from leaving. It\u2019s called breadcrumbing. You can research it. If abusers were awful 100% of the time, nobody would stay with them. \n\nI know you said you didn\u2019t ask for relationship advice but I think everyone is just very alarmed by the behavior you described and are concerned for you. It sounds like your dad didn\u2019t model what a healthy relationship looks like for you, since he seems to think your boyfriend\u2019s behavior is fine, and maybe you think this is normal because this is like the relationships you saw or how you were treated growing up. I assure you, none of this is normal or acceptable. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like that.

Leaving him there was not an arsehole move. It was a long awaited moment of standing up for yourself.

Aren't you stressed too with all the extra work you do for him?\n\n> Things were really good at the beginning\n\nSadly, that is how it works. At first, they're really great partners. You're in love, maybe move in together. Once they feel safe enough, they'll push your boundaries little by little: make a snarky comment here, question your skills there, insult your sanity another time. Because you're in love and because you remember it being different, you'll think that this might be just a phase and will look for an explanation for their change of character. \"Stress\" is a common argument in this situation. And you'll start questioning yourself. Slow but steady you'll adjust your own behaviour to avoid drama - which is healthy as a short-term reaction, because you take care of your own mental ressources. But if this is not a one-time-situation, it'll become unhealthy, because you'll start putting yourself second all the time, alongside with questioning your behaviour and worth. \n\nIf you want to keep this relationship going, please don't obey to any of his nonsense anymore. Don't avoid the drama HE is starting. If he can dish it out, he'll have to take it. Stay alert to things he does and says, and keep a close look on the emotions and reactions his behaviour does cause you to experience.\nIt'll be hard, but it'll be the only way to maybe save this relationship.
