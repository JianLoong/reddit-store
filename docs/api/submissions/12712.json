We have known each other since we were kids and were friends for years before we started dating. I never dated anyone before him and neither did he. Scott is perfect marriage material; he has always been unconditionally committed, takes great care of me and he is even the perfect height (a couple inches taller than me) for a husband.\n\nA month ago, he came to me with a surprising idea. He didn't want us to go to the prom together as a couple. Scott says that there is no fun in going to the prom with your pre-existent partner because the whole point is that it should be an special event where you create unique memories. He feels it would be a good thing for us the have some level of experience with other people in order to not feel trapped in our current relationship, specially before we finish high school considering we already know we will remain together during college as we are going to the same place.\n\nI wasn't really convinced but I agreed as I didn't even care that much about prom to begin with so I was fine just going with my friends and many of them are not expecting to have dates that night either. As such, I was surprised when I received a proposal. His name is Rob (18M) and we are together in a few classes. We aren't really friends but we have talked many times casually and I found him really funny and nice. He is a member of the school's basketball team and he is very tall and muscular. I don't think he even knew I had a boyfriend but he instantly asked me once I told him I didn't have a date and was going with friends.\n\nThe issue is that last week Scott came to me with bad news. The girl he wanted to go to the prom with told him no and, after a few more attempts with other ones, he realised that he was not going to find a date. He wanted to end his own idea and have us go together. I am totally against that as I have already committed to go with Rob and it would be very rude to cancel. I think Scott should just go with his friends or not go at this point.\n\nHe has been really sad and angry about this, avoiding me and yelling at me when I tried to reason with him. His mom says he has been acting like that at home too and is worried about him but she thinks I am in the right in this situation. I don't want him to feel bad but he is the one that put me in this situation and I don't want to punish other people because of his actions.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679266765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11w0m1x/aita_for_going_to_prom_without_my_boyfriend/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's already feeling trapped in the relationship, but you aren't seeing it. \n\nTell him he can still go to the prom, he can just go stag, and he can ask all kinds of other girls to dance with him. \n\nNTA but Scott is sure acting like one.", "NTA, but please don't be thinking about marriage yet. You're very young and you'll go through a lot of growing up and changing in the next ten years. Sometimes teen relationships last, but don't be planning your life with that expectation. And be wary of Scott; he's telling you he wants to be with other people and then coming back when other people don't want him.", "NTA. Go with Rob. Scott asked you because no one else would go with him. Don't be second fiddle. Also, doesn't it seem weird that he would suggest you go with different people? Scott wants you and to date others, too.", "NTA - your BF literally wanted to date someone else and when she shot him down (as well as a few others) he decided to go crawling back to you. He sucks. Go to the prom with Rob. Maybe he\u2019ll act like a real boyfriend. Because Scott clearly doesn\u2019t know how to be one.", "NTA. Your bf clearly wanted a free pass to hook up with another girl and is now upset no one wants him. The fact he wants to cancel the agreement shows this was always about him and what he wants and is a red flag warning about his controlling nature. Keep your date with Rob and enjoy the night. Break up with Scott because this won\u2019t be a once off. He\u2019s showing you his true character.", "NTA.  Scott shot himself in the foot, but it's not your job to clean up the mess.

But your assessment of this kid as \"perfect marriage material\" is way off.  He appears to be self-centered and manipulative, and this whole scenario should be a big red flag.   Don't be so sure you will remain together through college; more importantly, don't assume that you are supposed to be together.  You're both young and immature, and neither of you have been on your own, so I won't say you need to dump him over this, but I'd pay close attention to what he does in the future and think long and hard about whether he really is the one you want to marry.", "Nta \n\nHe wants another girl, but it didn't work out.

Move on.", "Nta.  Your boyfriend just learned what F* around and find out means.", "NTA and hopefully you leave Scott. I might be reaching but it sounds like Scott already had one foot out the door. He felt like other girls wanted him and you were the barrier that was stopping these other girls from going after him. He quickly found out he is not as desirable as he thought he was and now he\u2019s trying to go with you. He\u2019s treating you as worse case scenario, don\u2019t be that.", "NTA. \n\nPlease don\u2019t continue dating this boy. He tried to use your naivety against you to get what he wanted, which was to date and fools around with other girls while having you as a safety option.\n\nDoing that to someone you care about isn\u2019t marriage material. It sounds like his plans for your future together have been different than yours for a long time.\n\nIs your future college where you want to go? Or was it where your boyfriend was going? \n\nThere are plenty of boys taller than you in the world. There\u2019s even some that will match with you in ways besides height.", "Nta, he wanted you two not to got together, because he wanted another date, then he didn\u2019t get it and now he changed his mind, so he won\u2019t have to go alone.", "He fucked around and found out.

Do not choose your college, your career, your friends, etc based on what your high school boyfriend wants or is planning for himself. Good luck to you.\n\nPS: A boy who doesn\u2019t want to share prom night with his high school girlfriend of two years is not a great boyfriend. An 18 year old boy, any 18 year old boy, is not marriage material and you are too young to be considering a life-long commitment. All will come and will be better with time and experience.", "NTA\n\nYou went along with his idea, when the idea didn't pan out the way he thought he changed his mind. It would be rude to back out now. \n\nI do wonder about the person he wanted to go with though. Why did he only want to make \"special\" or \"unique\" memories with them and not you? This would have been a special event for the two of you as well, not many proms to attend after high school.", "(a) NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He feels it would be a good thing for us the have some level of experience with other people in order to not feel trapped in our current relationship, specially before we finish high school considering we already know we will remain together during college as we are going to the same place.\n\n(b) Awww. Go to prom w/ Rob.  Scott is not \"marriage material\"... he isn't even boyfriend material, after this nonsense.  No surprise some other girl told him no. How uncomfortable for her.", "NTA.\n\nHe made this mess.", "NTA - he can't have it both ways; he either wanted to go with you or he didn't. He can't just suddenly change his mind because he can't get another date...", "NTA - it was his dumb idea to begin with. The only reason he wants to go back on it is because he was rejected. I wouldn't want to be his \"last resort\". Plus you're right to stick to the commitment you made already with another date.", ">His mom says he has been acting like that at home too and is worried about him but she thinks I am in the right in this situation.\n\nI'm dead, even mom wouldn't back him up when he's probably only fed her his side of the story.\n\nObviously NTA, but you need to full-commit to going with Rob and also tell him about Scott since it sounds like he thinks you are single. He might want to have a relationship with you after prom. And if there's a part of you that wants that, I think you should go for it because it doesn't sound like Scott is as committed as you are and has tried to burn you to get his way multiple times. But if you aren't ready to maybe end things or not that interested in Rob, the least you have to do either way is tell him the important details about your status so that he's not making plans in his head about a relationship that you have no plans to pursue.", "NTA. Your boyfriend initiated this - he wanted to experience life without you - he needs to suck it up and grow a pair.\n\nFurthermore, the fact he even suggested it and had someone he wanted to go with speaks to deeper issues on his part. He under appreciated you, was thinking about what might have been and now that he finds out that he\u2019s not going to get his chance, is trying to deprive you of the very thing he said was good.\n\nHe sounds a bit immature tbh. Good luck with everything, make sure you enjoy yourself, and make sure you don\u2019t let your prom date feel bad - he shouldn\u2019t suffer for Scott\u2019s mistake.", "NTA, sounds like he was already feeling trapped and wanted to have a date with someone else. This isn\u2019t normal relationship behavior, and I think proves he isn\u2019t perfect marriage material at all. Dump Scott and have fun with Rob.", "What's perfect height for a husband mean?", "NTA OP, some people don\u2019t appreciate what they have right in front of them because they lack appreciation for said thing.", "NTA but the fact he asked other girls to prom shows you and everyone else that he is only dating you because you\u2019re convenient. He\u2019s with you because you like him and he doesn\u2019t want to be alone. You should definitely reconsider being in a relationship with your bf. Maybe you and your new prom date will click.", "NTA Dump this guy and do not look back. I\u2019ve never heard of any committed guy happily in a relationship pulling this. He is not a good guy. Also do not base your college and career on where your high school boyfriend is going.", "NTA He just wanted to cheat on the relationship. Grow a backbone and don't let him manipulate you like this. Dump the bf and go to prom", "NTA. Have fun at prom with Rob. Also, you may consider taking a break from dating your boyfriend when you go to college. College is a time of personal growth and new experiences. Just a thought.", "NTA\n\nHe wanted a chance to see how good his odds were of getting another girlfriend...without the risk of being single if he just dumped you first. \n\nHe wanted to test the waters of the dating pool without the 'risk'. Then he realized no one else was into him, so he came crawling back to you because he couldn't find a new option. \n\nThis should be a warning sign to you that he isn't as in to you as he's coming across. He likes the stability of having a girlfriend in general. He's just with *you* because you're the one who took him. \n\nI'd fear I'd be dumped like a hot potato the first time a girl in college (or wherever path he takes) after high school shows an interest in him", "NTA this was his idea and you said yes. He did this to himself.", "He\u2019s not marriage material, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.

Of course he\u2019s depressed - he set himself up for failure that ended with him being thoroughly humiliated while you get to go on a date with a basketball star.\n\nThat said, while the situation is hilarious from the outside, in reality, you need to step back and ask if you go to the prom with another person, will that permanently damage your existing relationship with your bf?
