We have known each other since we were kids and were friends for years before we started dating. I never dated anyone before him and neither did he. Scott is perfect marriage material; he has always been unconditionally committed, takes great care of me and he is even the perfect height (a couple inches taller than me) for a husband.\n\nA month ago, he came to me with a surprising idea. He didn't want us to go to the prom together as a couple. Scott says that there is no fun in going to the prom with your pre-existent partner because the whole point is that it should be an special event where you create unique memories. He feels it would be a good thing for us the have some level of experience with other people in order to not feel trapped in our current relationship, specially before we finish high school considering we already know we will remain together during college as we are going to the same place.\n\nI wasn't really convinced but I agreed as I didn't even care that much about prom to begin with so I was fine just going with my friends and many of them are not expecting to have dates that night either. As such, I was surprised when I received a proposal. His name is Rob (18M) and we are together in a few classes. We aren't really friends but we have talked many times casually and I found him really funny and nice. He is a member of the school's basketball team and he is very tall and muscular. I don't think he even knew I had a boyfriend but he instantly asked me once I told him I didn't have a date and was going with friends.\n\nThe issue is that last week Scott came to me with bad news. The girl he wanted to go to the prom with told him no and, after a few more attempts with other ones, he realised that he was not going to find a date. He wanted to end his own idea and have us go together. I am totally against that as I have already committed to go with Rob and it would be very rude to cancel. I think Scott should just go with his friends or not go at this point.\n\nHe has been really sad and angry about this, avoiding me and yelling at me when I tried to reason with him. His mom says he has been acting like that at home too and is worried about him but she thinks I am in the right in this situation. I don't want him to feel bad but he is the one that put me in this situation and I don't want to punish other people because of his actions.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679266765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11w0m1x/aita_for_going_to_prom_without_my_boyfriend/", "score": 1302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're very young and you'll go through a lot of growing up and changing in the next ten years. Sometimes teen relationships last, but don't be planning your life with that expectation. And be wary of Scott; he's telling you he wants to be with other people and then coming back when other people don't want him.", "NTA. Go with Rob. Scott asked you because no one else would go with him. Don't be second fiddle. Also, doesn't it seem weird that he would suggest you go with different people? Scott wants you and to date others, too.", "NTA - your BF literally wanted to date someone else and when she shot him down (as well as a few others) he decided to go crawling back to you. He sucks. Go to the prom with Rob. Maybe he\u2019ll act like a real boyfriend. Because Scott clearly doesn\u2019t know how to be one.", "NTA. Your bf clearly wanted a free pass to hook up with another girl and is now upset no one wants him. The fact he wants to cancel the agreement shows this was always about him and what he wants and is a red flag warning about his controlling nature. Keep your date with Rob and enjoy the night.

But your assessment of this kid as \"perfect marriage material\" is way off.  He appears to be self-centered and manipulative, and this whole scenario should be a big red flag.   Don't be so sure you will remain together through college; more importantly, don't assume that you are supposed to be together.  You're both young and immature, and neither of you have been on your own, so I won't say you need to dump him over this, but I'd pay close attention to what he does in the future and think long and hard about whether he really is the one you want to marry.", "Nta \n\nHe wants another girl, but it didn't work out.

Move on.", "Nta.  Your boyfriend just learned what F* around and find out means.", "NTA and hopefully you leave Scott. I might be reaching but it sounds like Scott already had one foot out the door. He felt like other girls wanted him and you were the barrier that was stopping these other girls from going after him. He quickly found out he is not as desirable as he thought he was and now he\u2019s trying to go with you. He\u2019s treating you as worse case scenario, don\u2019t be that.", "NTA. \n\nPlease don\u2019t continue dating this boy. He tried to use your naivety against you to get what he wanted, which was to date and fools around with other girls while having you as a safety option.\n\nDoing that to someone you care about isn\u2019t marriage material. It sounds like his plans for your future together have been different than yours for a long time.\n\nIs your future college where you want to go? Or was it where your boyfriend was going? \n\nThere are plenty of boys taller than you in the world. There\u2019s even some that will match with you in ways besides height.", "Nta, he wanted you two not to got together, because he wanted another date, then he didn\u2019t get it and now he changed his mind, so he won\u2019t have to go alone.", "He fucked around and found out.

Do not choose your college, your career, your friends, etc based on what your high school boyfriend wants or is planning for himself. Good luck to you.\n\nPS: A boy who doesn\u2019t want to share prom night with his high school girlfriend of two years is not a great boyfriend.

All will come and will be better with time and experience.", "NTA\n\nYou went along with his idea, when the idea didn't pan out the way he thought he changed his mind. It would be rude to back out now. \n\nI do wonder about the person he wanted to go with though. Why did he only want to make \"special\" or \"unique\" memories with them and not you?

How uncomfortable for her.", "NTA.\n\nHe made this mess.", "NTA - he can't have it both ways; he either wanted to go with you or he didn't. He can't just suddenly change his mind because he can't get another date...", "NTA - it was his dumb idea to begin with. The only reason he wants to go back on it is because he was rejected. I wouldn't want to be his \"last resort\". Plus you're right to stick to the commitment you made already with another date.", ">His mom says he has been acting like that at home too and is worried about him but she thinks I am in the right in this situation.\n\nI'm dead, even mom wouldn't back him up when he's probably only fed her his side of the story.\n\nObviously NTA, but you need to full-commit to going with Rob and also tell him about Scott since it sounds like he thinks you are single. He might want to have a relationship with you after prom. And if there's a part of you that wants that, I think you should go for it because it doesn't sound like Scott is as committed as you are and has tried to burn you to get his way multiple times. But if you aren't ready to maybe end things or not that interested in Rob, the least you have to do either way is tell him the important details about your status so that he's not making plans in his head about a relationship that you have no plans to pursue.", "NTA. Your boyfriend initiated this - he wanted to experience life without you - he needs to suck it up and grow a pair.\n\nFurthermore, the fact he even suggested it and had someone he wanted to go with speaks to deeper issues on his part. He under appreciated you, was thinking about what might have been and now that he finds out that he\u2019s not going to get his chance, is trying to deprive you of the very thing he said was good.\n\nHe sounds a bit immature tbh. Good luck with everything, make sure you enjoy yourself, and make sure you don\u2019t let your prom date feel bad - he shouldn\u2019t suffer for Scott\u2019s mistake.", "NTA, sounds like he was already feeling trapped and wanted to have a date with someone else. This isn\u2019t normal relationship behavior, and I think proves he isn\u2019t perfect marriage material at all. Dump Scott and have fun with Rob.", "What's perfect height for a husband mean?", "NTA OP, some people don\u2019t appreciate what they have right in front of them because they lack appreciation for said thing.", "NTA but the fact he asked other girls to prom shows you and everyone else that he is only dating you because you\u2019re convenient. He\u2019s with you because you like him and he doesn\u2019t want to be alone. You should definitely reconsider being in a relationship with your bf. Maybe you and your new prom date will click.", "NTA Dump this guy and do not look back. I\u2019ve never heard of any committed guy happily in a relationship pulling this. He is not a good guy. Also do not base your college and career on where your high school boyfriend is going.", "NTA He just wanted to cheat on the relationship. Grow a backbone and don't let him manipulate you like this. Dump the bf and go to prom", "NTA. Have fun at prom with Rob. Also, you may consider taking a break from dating your boyfriend when you go to college. College is a time of personal growth and new experiences. Just a thought.", "NTA\n\nHe wanted a chance to see how good his odds were of getting another girlfriend...without the risk of being single if he just dumped you first. \n\nHe wanted to test the waters of the dating pool without the 'risk'. Then he realized no one else was into him, so he came crawling back to you because he couldn't find a new option. \n\nThis should be a warning sign to you that he isn't as in to you as he's coming across. He likes the stability of having a girlfriend in general. He's just with *you* because you're the one who took him. \n\nI'd fear I'd be dumped like a hot potato the first time a girl in college (or wherever path he takes) after high school shows an interest in him", "NTA this was his idea and you said yes.

Of course he\u2019s depressed - he set himself up for failure that ended with him being thoroughly humiliated while you get to go on a date with a basketball star.\n\nThat said, while the situation is hilarious from the outside, in reality, you need to step back and ask if you go to the prom with another person, will that permanently damage your existing relationship with your bf?

My mother was dating a boy in her senior year of highschool, he asked her to prom, this was probably in october of that year.  well one thing lead to another and like some high school things happen, their relationship came to an abrupt end.  it wasn't a big fight or anything, it just sorta ended.  so a month later when some other guy asked her to prom, she didn't think much of it and accepted. \n\nWell night of the prom, and who is the first guy at her door?  her ex-boyfriend.  she said it was a very awkward moment, and when her father heard what was going on he sat all three of the down (the 2nd guy got there late).  He looked all 3 kids in the eyes and said \"you don't have much in this world you can call your own, one of those things is your honesty, and how honest people think of you.  I will apologize on behalf of my daughter for the confusion this has caused and any embarrassment.\"   Then he looked at my mother and my mom, having been raised by him her whole life, knew what he meant without him saying it.  so she went to the prom with her ex boyfriend.  \n\nWhy?  Because she promised him FIRST, and they never talked about not going to the prom together after breaking up.  She did apologized herself to the other boy.  it wasn't his fault, and she clearly would have rather gone with him, then her ex.  but she never forgot the importance of keeping your word.  now that i dated myself badly with that little story; i'll get to the core of the issue\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntake it or leave it.  but i do ask you listen to someone who has dated loved and lost, and seen all sides of people for many more years then you've been alive.  Your boyfriend gaslight you at the start of this story.  his nonsense about going to prom with different people was just him trying to get permission to sleep with someone else without straight saying it.  It didn't become a problem till the girl he wanted to get with shot him down, then he realized his girlfriend had a date to prom with a good looking guy, probably better looking then him, and his petty jealousy kicked in.  hence his tantrum.\n\nNow im not going to tell you to dump him, only you know your heart.  But you'd be stupid not to suspect his interest in you if he was willing to toss what yuo two have together aside for another girl entirely when he has a chance.

Him asking you to cancel your plans is disrespectful. Respect is important in any relationship be it friendship or romantic.  Now even worse than anything is that he feels the right to yell at you.  That's just not okay in my books. Your parents probably don't yell at you much, if at all. Your boyfriend should not be yelling at you either. This whole situation is your bf's fault. He wanted permission to fool around with other girls and have you as a safety net. However, I promise you that if he liked any of his \"experiments/new experiences/unique memories\" more than you, he would dump you in a heartbeat. Go have fun at prom, eat, dance, take pictures.

If you wouldn't have been invited by someone and he would have been with that girl, i bet that that night he would have broken your heart.\n\nYou are too nice to see what's happening and you definetly won't do anything wrong by keeping your word.\n\nAnd Scott will only keep you until something better comes up... It's sad what he's done and it's wrong for him to try and guilt trip you into giving up.\n\nYou're NTA", "Nah, bye bye scott, and hope Rob gets to NBA. Nta.", ">The issue is that last week Scott came to me with bad news. The girl he wanted to go to the prom with told him no and, after a few more attempts with other ones, he realised that **he was not going to find a date**. \n\n\nWhat did he expect you to do? Go with your friends and watch him go on a prom date with another girl?  Why is that 'traumatic' for him, but would be OK for you? \n\nThis guy is silly.  It feels like he did a soft break up with you, and now he regrets it.  You've committed to go with Rob, I think you should stick with that.  Please tell Rob everything that's going on and tell him you are still going with him. (just in case Scott tries to tell Rob you've changed your mind). \n\nI do want to say something else.  Scott isn't marriage material. No one in high school is marriage material.  Needs a few more years for someone's adult character to come through before anyone can see that.", "He only suggested this idea because he already had someone else he wanted to take to prom that wasn't you. Now he's back pedalling and being jealous because it backfired. This is not the definition of someone loyal to you or someone \"marriage material\". He has effectively made you his back up plan. Dump him and go to the prom with basketball dude guilt free.", "Oh, but if it had been the other way around (you going alone/with friends and him going with the other girl) he wouldn't have cared one bit. That guy doesn't care about you.\n\nAnd just an advice from a woman 25 years older than you: A man's height is one of the least important qualities. Perfect height doesn't make up for treating you badly, like this guy is doing. Of course you are allowed to have preferences, and you are still a teenager, but how he treats you is soooo much more important than how he looks or how tall he is.", "Girl. Drop this loser. He clearly doesn't value you at all.", "This scenario is classic. Scott is in for a rude awakening.", "Yep.  I dated one, too.", "I'd like to thank you for introducing this masterpiece into my life, I don't know how I've managed for so long without it. Will definitely watch again. And again. And again.", "OMG, my 80\u2019s hair\u2026", "I think it's safe to say that Scott was expecting to do stuff with another girl.", "Scotty didn't know.", "Having a preference for a physical attribute in your life partner? Disgusting!", "Me too, Rob definitely gets my vote.", "Every time this gets posted I take the time to read it and laugh. Stupid jerk didn't realize his girlfriend was a total catch and was dating down by being with him, even in the post he can't seem to admit that she's hot. I hope she dumped his ass for the tall tattooed guy.", "Yeah. There\u2019s an awful lot of stories on [BORU](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) about guys who pressure their wife/gf to open the relationship and end up regretting it.", "Oh. There are plenty of stories circulating like this online with both sexes taking the big L.\n\nPeople are morons", "Bless you for posting this. It\u2019s always so fulfilling when it comes across my eyes.", "I'm rooting SO hard for tall tattooed guy, he knows a catch when he sees one", "Pressuring your partner to open the relationship is just so lacking in empathy. These dudes just want to cheat without feeling guilty and without worrying about getting caught or the girlfriend getting angry.", "Exactly. Everyone seems to be forgetting that he's PERFECT in the height department. Who cares if he wanted to screw another woman after prom? He's marriage material because of his height!"]}
