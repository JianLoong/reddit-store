I said that\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s not expensive, which she said that it wouldn\u2019t be because other BMs wouldn\u2019t be able to afford something expensive. **EDIT** she said that it would be around \u20ac60 for the dress as she didn\u2019t want everyone spending a lot and I had sent aside \u20ac100 incase of alterations etc\u2026 \n\nShe invited all of us to go wedding dress and bridesmaid dress shopping in a bridal shop and when she sent the invite I said again that I wasn\u2019t willing to spend a lot of money on a dress that I will only ever wear once and that I would feel anxious about the price and feel awful in front of everyone and pressured. Again she reassured me. \nWe all went BM and Dress shopping, she found her dress and when it came to bridesmaid shopping everyone was trying dresses on not knowing the price so I asked and it was nearly \u20ac200 for a dress. I tried dresses on thinking that my sister would say let\u2019s try somewhere else after knowing the price, but the other BM fell in love with the dresses they chose. I tried so many dresses on and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in any of them especially knowing the price of them. \nI started to feel pressure off everyone for not choosing a dress and I\u2019m the end I said \u2018I\u2019m sorry but I think it would be best if I don\u2019t be a bridesmaid, as everyone likes their dresses and clearly ok paying that money\u2019 to which everyone was like \u2018there must be a dress you like\u2019 I said \u2018well I\u2019m just not willing to pay that much money on a dress that I\u2019ll wear once\u2019. \n\nI would also like to add that I was told that I also had to pay \u20ac100 for hair and makeup and then accessories on top. At first I said I wasn\u2019t willing to pay that, however I agreed and paid the deposit. \n I also needed to pay for a hotel for two nights and the hen party on top of that. \nAfter calculating it all in my head and it would have cost me nearly \u20ac1000 just for her wedding and hen party. \n\nSo I stuck to my morals and said no. \nEveryone then went to pay their deposits and I said I am going home. My sister said she understood and we hugged it out. However, she later told our parents that I was embarrassing and that I should have took her to one side and said how I felt. \n\nAt the time I felt so pressured to pick a dress that I just said it how it was. \nI\u2019m not paying that for a dress sorry! \n\nI feel that I have been made out to be the Ass Hole because I\u2019m not willing to spend that much money.\n\nI have also said that I will go to some of the hen party but not all of it as I am travelling alone and want to get home in the daylight. Again made to feel like an AH. \n\nBaring in mind that the hair and make up was only just booked and the wedding is at the end of the year. Apparently they are refusing to refund the deposit. \n\nMy parents agree with me and said they are proud I stuck to my morals.  \n\nHowever I feel like I have been made out to be the AH. \n\nAm I an AH?\n\n**edit** \n\nI would like to add the moral is regarding financial side.\n\nI didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t be bridesmaid horribly, I was getting dressed thrown at me making me out that I should just pick something. \nI felt overwhelmed and pressured by everyone. My sister could have stepped in but she never did expediting me to clearly just say yes. \nThe dresses had to be ordered there and then. Some bridesmaid were matching me and another were supposed to but she fell in love with a dress there. If everyone wasn\u2019t matching then it wouldn\u2019t be a massive issue. \n\nI agreed to pay for my dress as her wedding is on a budget but then she has added on more and more to it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she makes them all pay for their own flowers too at this rate", "created_utc": 1683801566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ejhq9/aita_for_telling_my_sister_im_not_being_a/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's totally okay not to want to be a bridesmaid anymore when you realize you can't afford it. I agree with your sister that there would have been a better time to discuss it instead of getting on a soapbox about paying X amount for a dress you'll \"only wear once.\" (That's not a rule, by the way.

As she said, you should've taken her aside and tied her you weren't buying such an expensive dress and not said so in front of everyone and then even coming out with not being a bm just because of a dress. You used this as an excuse for something you didn't want to do from the start, and that's not cool. And doubt it in front of everyone is even shittier.\n\nAnyone's response would've been saying an excuse about not picking a dress right there and not making a spectacle in front of everyone, and just bought another dress less expensive.", "Mild YTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying I can\u2019t afford to be in a wedding or not feeling comfortable spending a certain amount; however, if you had concerns about spending money, it\u2019s unclear why you wouldn\u2019t have checked in with your sister about what the expectations were when she asked you to be a bridesmaid? I can\u2019t imagine you thought you were only paying for the dress, so it\u2019s curious that you didn\u2019t talk about what you could afford or see if there were things you could opt out of to save money. \n\nAnd I hope you can recognize that this was not some big moral issue; it was about a budget, and it was ultimately unkind to use that moment to publicly make a big deal about the cost and tell your sister you no longer wanted to be a bridesmaid.", "[deleted]", "NTA. You made it clear since the start you have a budget. So it's ok if you stick to that.", "YTA\n\nThis is probably going to get downvoted, and normally in a severe communication break down like this I would say everyone sucks, but this situation is a little different. This is your sister\u2019s wedding, and unless you are estranged from your family, it is practically expected for sisters to be in the bridal party or even the maid of honor, so you\u2019re the AH for jumping to this conclusion of not being in the wedding so quickly and over something that is really pretty small. \n\nI\u2019m surprised your parents said they are proud of you for sticking to your morals. I guess being cheap is a moral? \n\nAlso, there are plenty of ways to be safe hanging out in groups after dark, so saying you can only go to part of the bachelorette party so you can go home in the daytime shifts the focus to you and your perceived needs and takes the focus of your sister who is being celebrated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why should she have to keep being polite when her sister had no problem with the other bridesmaids walking all over OP and pressuring her to get a dress she couldn't afford?", "I mean Morals as in not just feeling pressured to order the dress and then worrying about where I will get the money from on top of everything else she wants us to pay for. \nShe could have stepped in but never did. \nThanks for your comment x", "Thank you for your comment x", "Agreed thanks x", "My friends said the same that it\u2019s so far in advance they should refund you or take it off the bill and they refund me. Ive even been told to contact them myself but I don\u2019t even know who it\u2019s with and tbh I have just given up. It\u2019s all messed up. X", "Oooh, I can actually help with this unless contract law is very different where OP is from. A deposit guarantees one party (the buyer/client) performs their part of the contract and protects the seller/service provider's time because the idea is that once they book you, that's a slot that could have gone to someone else. It is *generally* not refundable unless their contract explicitly provides that it can be refunded. (FYI, the wedding industry can be intense hahaha. I once was called upon as MOH to get a refund from a supplier for butterflies because they were late for the ceremony and the part where the butterflies were needed was over. It took me five hours, hahaha, and in the end the bride felt bad for the supplier and we released the butterflies at the reception.)\n\nOP can try talking to the hair & makeup team and explain--maybe the new bridesmaid (if there is a replacement) can swap in and just pay OP for the deposit already given. u/Quirky_Alternative19, tagging you just to make a suggestion.", "Exactly \ud83d\ude33 x", "I said we should all wear different but the same colour but 4 of the BM are matching me and her MOH were supposed to match but she chose the expensive dress and there for I couldn\u2019t just pick another dress because it would look weird x", "She new it was financial. She could have stepped in when I was getting pressured but she expected me to agree to pay like the others did. I didn\u2019t say it horribly there wasn\u2019t a better time to say it because of what was happening. \n\nWith all the other costs she kept on adding it was getting out of hand. \n\nTganks for you comment", "Yup, it was the tenor of this being a moral issue that made me read her post as a judgment of her sister. I didn't major in philosophy, but I did take 24 units in it--including Ethics and Morality--and I don't see the moral issue. Reading her response to the question didn't help, but her fleshing it out did make me understand how stressed she was in the situation and I changed my vote to NTA.", "I have to say, I don't get big weddings. All the expenses, which always balloon because capitalism imposes a 'wedding tax', all the stress, and all at an event that's supposed to be two people celebrating the fact that they love each other so much that they want to share their lives, with or without the trappings of conventional beauty. Obviously happy for her if it's what she wants, but I wish for your sake that she was more understanding of the fact that what she wants won't fit your budget. Especially with things as they are now, no one should shame you for that. NTA - you'll be there for her on the big day and that's the important part.\n\nEdit: misread something.", "Personal preference and morals are two different things. Your *personal preference* is to not spend hundreds on a dress for one day. Your financial situation may not *allow* you to spend hundreds on a dress for one day. But by saying that your \u201cmorals\u201d won\u2019t allow you to spend that much on a dress, you\u2019re putting yourself on a high horse and implying that you have an ethical objection to spending that much money, which\u2026 kinda makes you sound like an AH.", "Aaah, now that you spell it out I get it. You know how everyone tells that one person in the pub who isn't drinking that they're a killjoy? There's something similar when it comes to shopping, and I feel you. You shouldn't have to spend out of your budget, and you did tell her multiple times about it. I still don't get the moral issue (but then again I'm not a philosopher, haha), but with more info I'm understanding how sensitive this issue was for you and I'm changing my vote.", "I have been in 3 weddings and never once have the bride and groom paid for everything. I have always paid for everything as a bridesmaid. I also think you should have done some research ahead of time, my bridesmaids dresses have always been upwards of $150. As soon as I read you post, I was shocked you even thought it was possible to get a dress for that cheap. I think both you and your sister had unrealistic expectations. Also, I would be really hurt if my sister decided not to be in my wedding and that may be why she said those things to your parents.", "what a mess", "I have a well paying job and that\u2019s just too steep never mind the time and all the expectations that comes with it. There is no way I could have afforded that in my 20s and 30s. Stick to your guns\u2026 it\u2019s just too much of an ask!", "For sure your sister stinks for that. You should have said flat out that she either needs to help you pay (privately ask this btw), revise her vision to something in your range, or you\u2019re happy to support her as a guest instead of in the bridal party. You\u2019re not TA for not putting yourself in a financial bind.\n\nI\u2019m saying that framing this as \u201cmoral\u201d makes you sound obnoxious and supercilious.", "It could be that English is not OP's first language tbh. Sometimes we non native speakers choose the wrong words to convey our meaning bc we can't remember what the right word was. She might have just meant her personal rules of not going over budget. Idk, just giving her the benefit of the doubt", "Thanks for your comment x", "Thanks \ud83d\ude0a x", "3 have matching dresses and me and the other were supposed to match. The other decided she fell in love with a dress so therefore I didn\u2019t want to spoil it for her either just because I couldn\u2019t afford the dress hence saying it will be easier if I was bridesmaid. If everyone was wearing different dresses it wouldn\u2019t have been a massive issue they they aren\u2019t x", "It sounds like you have a different tradition to us, as when a bride and groom ask you to be part of their wedding they should pay as they have asked. \n\nHowever I agreed to pay for the dress as she\u2019s in a budget and I would have to buy an outfit if I wasn\u2019t. \nshe could have gone online to look for dresses in that price range, when she chose a shop I knew that she hadn\u2019t looked at prices I did online but she was adamant it wasnt that expensive so that\u2019s why I kept mentioning it to her saying I\u2019m not paying a lot and she agreed. Also having the added financial costs of hair makeup accessories shoes etc.. then the expensive hen on top. \n\nI wasn\u2019t willing to feel pressured to pay for a \u20ac200 dress. She could have said something but thought I\u2019d just say yes and find the money from somewhere but I don\u2019t have that kind of money.", "Yeah OP is coming off very naive to me. I\u2019ve also been a bridesmaid multiple times and was expected to pay for my dress, my portion of the bachelorette and hair and makeup.", "Lol she does not sound supercilious by any normal standard of the word. What a ridiculous assertion.", "I don't get this, why would it be bad for you to have a different dress, in the end 3 already had a dress different from the other one so you were already no already. Did these girls know about your budget ? Anyway, I find this so ridiculous... you can fall un love with a dress but you need to take consideration of others too. \n\nYou shouldn't have had to say no to being a bm just because one \"fell in love\" with a dress... sorry but what a pushover.", "The one not matching is MOH so MOH can be different to the bridesmaids if I just had a random dress as well it wouldn\u2019t be the exact colour because they are all getting theirs from the shop so it just wouldn\u2019t look right. Hope that makes sense. \n\nIf she had said for example baby pink was the colour everyone could have looked online for a baby pink dress everyone is different but it\u2019s the same colour she didn\u2019t x", "But why didn't you say no to such an expensive dress ?! You could've bought the same dresses as the others and told them you had this already settled with your sister, if they wanted something more expensive she was to be laying for the difference or they should've. Not just, I won't be a bm anymore"]}
