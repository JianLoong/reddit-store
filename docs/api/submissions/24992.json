So I can see why she\u2019s upset (if that\u2019s the case), however even this isn\u2019t your \u201cfault\u201d.

Many are encouraged to eat vegetarian diets, though.\n\nSikhism leaves it to individuals, but many practice vegetarianism.\n\nRastafarians follow ital. Many adopted the Old Testament dietary restrictiobs and do not eat shellfish or pork. It's an idea of eating of the earth and purely.

His teacher was mortified and immediately called his dad. His dad just laughed. He said, though they wouldn't choose to allow it, he was child, also had learning difficulties, and was done in innocence. He found the teachers level of panic amusing and respectful.
