You were excited and didn't do it on purpose, but he feels like he missed out on a moment. All of those feelings are valid. But then I kept reading...\n\nCalling you names and refusing to get involved with buying things for the baby is a dick move no matter how you look at it. It's a tantrum. Call him out on it. You're having a child. Once the birth has taken place you won't have the time or capacity to coddle and placate an adult toddler too. You are NTA.", "Yikes, that treatment is red flag behavior. I get being disappointed that he didn't get to find out the way he wanted, but that didn't make it any less of a surprise to him. And now you're responsible for buying the baby's things? I hope you don't keep separate finances because that's another GIANT red flag. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being an AH.", "NTA it seems like you already have one baby in the house. He only wants the symbolic parts of parenthood and none of the detail. He\u2019s already not interested in learning more about the baby\u2019s health. He\u2019s already refusing to participate in buying baby things (which typically would be something to do together). I doubt you are in for a smooth parenting ride with him around.", "NTA. He\u2019s had an extremely unfair and outsized response to this, you could have still shared the joy of this moment together but he\u2019s chosen to take that away from the two of you completely. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop myself from opening that email. \n\nGiving you the silent treatment and refusing to help pay for your kid(?!) is simply too ridiculous for me to fathom.", "NTA - Your husband is immature. He expected you to be a mind reader, then proceeded to call you names and throw a tantrum. While he is valid for being disappointed, his response was not okay. Don't apologize anymore, and if he continues to throw it in your face, explain to him that you both need to work on communicating and not expect the other to mind read. He needs to grow up fast because once your son comes, maturity and communication are important for new parents. \n\nBTW, I also found out the sex of my son first, and I called up my husband to tell him (we were at work). When I asked him if he was mad that I found out first, his response was, \"No, you're carrying him. You should be the one to know first.\" If your husband wanted to know with you, he should have expressed those feelings beforehand.", "NTA - sounds like 2 babies", "You didn't meet the expectations he never disclosed to you. You apologize that your actions while completely adequate and innocent made him said. You did everything right. He has a case being upset, he has no case blaming you for it and beyond all of that punishing you for it!\n\nThere is one asshole in your house and it is not you. NTA", "Okay, so your husband had ideas on how this was going to go and didn't communicate those ideas to you.  You on the other hand were excited and maybe jumped the gun on doing something that could have been/should have been a shared thing.  \n\nHow about let's just move on?  He can't \"punish\" you for the rest of the pregnancy because now he knows, and you can't put the horse back into the barn.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. And yikes, that kid is going to be a dad.", "NAH. Your Husband's feelings are valid as is your excitement. But, the reality is he didn't think to tell you and you didn't think to ask.\n\nIf anything, this highlights the pair of you have a communication issue which you both need to address.", "ESH.\n\nIt would have cost you nothing to wait and find out together, or to contact your partner and see if he minded. This is the first thing, besides health, that either of you get to learn about your baby. I can see why lots of people find it exciting and want to share that together. You didn't bother to find out whether he, like many (most?) valued that. You did take away what could have been a treasured moment for you both as parents. His upset is understandable. \n\nHowever, his refusal to buy the baby's things now is ridiculous and downright childish. He is cutting off his nose to spite his face here. \"I didn't get to find out the sex at the same time as you so now I won't be involved in the next thing - that'll teach you\". It would be laughable if this guy wasn't about to become a parent.", "I think it\u2019s a bit of an ESH situation. The doctor already told you the baby was healthy, so that\u2019s not why you opened it. And it\u2019s not fair to say \u201che should be happy the baby is healthy\u201d because that has nothing to do with you being impatient about the gender results. Shouldn\u2019t *you* have been satisfied that the doctor already told you the baby is healthy and not spoiled the gender surprise? It would\u2019ve been courteous to text him that the results are in your inbox and ask him if you can open it or if he wants to do it together. It seems odd and not very considerate that you didn\u2019t do that. Both of you messed up by not anticipating this situation and talking about your vision for learning this news. He should not be lashing out at you given that he didn\u2019t express how he wanted to learn it together.", "YTA,  You can't expect him to be excited about all the milestones if you keep on robbing him of the opportunity. He is lashing out because you are showing little to no respect for him as the father. \n\nIs he being petty and childish? most certainly. Is there history of you doing this in the past and this is just the tip of the iceberg? We as your audience don't know. Hard to judge his reaction without knowing a lot more context.  \n\nIt would have taken a millisecond of thought to realise that he would have wanted to share in this experience. You already had the doctors word that the baby was healthy. You chose to find out anyway. \n\nReally shouldn't take a mind reader that the father would want to share this moment with the mother.", "ESH\n\nHe reacted horribly and he probably just unloaded on you a whole workday of stress with that. However, he's still entitled to decide how, when and, most importantly, **if** he wants to know. There's no value in saying \"I didn't want to ruin the surprise\" right after you did exactly that and willingly.", "ESH. Personally I do feel like that is something you both do together, although I understand your excitement, I think it's pretty standard that finding out the sex would be something you do together, so it was thoughtless of you. \n\nHowever his reaction is immature and pretty shitty. Basically removing himself from responsibilities like picking out things for the baby, honestly if he's going to be like that over a mistake I'd be worried about how he's going to act out when he is upset in the future. \n\"I missed the baby's first steps, so now I'm not going to help with bedtime because I've been robbed of this moment\" \n\nIgnoring you is also just immature and ridiculously. This man needs to sort himself out and learn how to respond like an adult before the baby gets here. \n\nYes he has a right to be upset about you not thinking of him in that moment, of you taking away that initial excitement you should have had together and he absolutely has a right to express that (without insulting you) \nBut he doesn't have a right to wash his hands of planning for the baby or give you the silent treatment. \n\nHe needs to grow up really quickly.", "NTA.  He didn\u2019t tell you he wanted to read the results with you, you can\u2019t read his mind.  But people can get weird about gender reveals.  At least you apologized.\n\nIt might be understandable for him to be upset, but telling you that you are now responsible for buying all the baby\u2019s things is way over the top, even if he doesn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d mean it.  In another comment, you mention that he also gave you the silent treatment a few days ago when you forgot to bring a thumb drive to scan some documents.  Was it actually your responsibility to bring the drive or did he spring that on you?  It\u2019s kinda sounding like he punishes you for small mistakes (or breaking rules that you didn\u2019t even know existed) with the silent treatment.  Which isn\u2019t really a good partnership.  You are both about to have a baby - HIS baby as well as yours, and he can\u2019t be laying all the responsibility on you because he is mildly disappointed.  Is he going to give you the silent treatment every time you make a minor mistake like forgetting to bring something?  Life gets much more complicated when you have a baby, you don\u2019t need a partner sulking like a second child every time something goes wrong.", "Get a fucking backbone.\n\n\nHe is fincially punishing you for a mistake? \n\n\nThis is still his child.\n\n\n\nYou need to sit him down and tell him in no uncertain terms that he doesn't have the authority to punish you and if he already announces he wont fullfill his responsiblities as a father, you will be ready to end the relationship over it.\n\n\n\nHe either loves and respects you, or he doesn't. \n\n\nHe either is a father to that child, or he is not.\n\n\nYou don't need to parent the tantrum of an adult man", "NTA. As you said, he should be glad that the baby is healthy and help you prepare for it, not mourn for some over-romanticized idea copied from social media. Hopefully when the actual, physical, crying baby is born and becomes more concrete and not just an abstract occasion for celebrations, he will grow into the role of a parent \ud83e\udd1e", "You're NTA. He's having a ridiculous tantrum and I couldn't figure out why until I got to this part:\n\n>The last thing he said to me was that I'm now responsible for buying all the baby's things because I spoiled the surprise for him\n\nAnd there it is... so what's next? Fast forward to when the baby arrives. He's going to find another excuse to berate you for something minor, and your punishment will be handling *all* diaper changes and midnight feedings.\n\nI hope you stop apologizing, because this sounds like it's his way of keeping you in a state where you're trying to appease him.", "So.. if he can\u2019t know everything at the same time, then he doesn\u2019t want to know anything?  He no longer wants to be involved with the baby and buying items that he will have to use and be in his home because you opened an email?  Hopefully he becomes a grown up soon because the baby doesn\u2019t wait for you both to be present when they roll over, say their first word, take their first steps or tell you about their first girlfriend.  This issue is about to get way worse.  His feelings are valid and so will yours when you miss a \u201cfirst\u201d activity at some point, so an apology was in order although please find a way for you all to work through this without him just stepping back from everything.  Good luck and congratulations on your son!", "NTA, he got his surprise when you told him", "NTA\n\n> The last thing he said to me was that I'm now responsible for buying all the baby's things because I spoiled the surprise for him.\n\nFather of the year right there. Baby isn\u2019t even here yet and he\u2019s acting like that. Yikes.", "NTA. What the hell did I just read.  You are not a mind reader, he didn\u2019t tell you \u201cbabe wait to read the email until I get home\u201d. Or anything like that. He needs to understand there will be a lot of firsts he is going to miss as much as I hate to say it it\u2019s going to happen.

Plus, how can you get NIPT results and *not* look - the gender is the only fun part of them, the rest is nerve-wracking!", "NTA I think that your husband is creating drama to dodge being a proper husband and father. Like he is making up excuses for you to feel guilty so that you will agree to whatever he wants. What he wants is to get out of paying for his own child. Sheesh.", "I don't know if he had said that me being on the hook for buying all of our baby stuff was serious or not. Feels shitty either way. Still, I don't want this to be the reason why communication breaks down. I recognize my part in him being hurt and I'd like to make amends.", "The separate finance thing might be cultural? It's not usual for married couples to have joint bank accounts (unless it's for a loan or mortgage). That being said, since I do make more I've been more than happy to take on a bigger share of financial responsibility. So far, I've been paying for my OB visits, though he did pay half for the NIPT testing.", "We initially planned for my mom and I to do the baby shopping together since she has more experience (she runs a nursery, aside from the obvious parent status heh). That being said, now that he's expressed this, I also wonder if he wanted to be part of the process too?

Very unsure how to feel about this :/", "He did not tell me he wanted to find out together, in fact, he doesn't talk about the baby much. However, I understand why he feels hurt and I also understand my part in it. I realize I could have slowed my roll and given it a moment or two to think about it, but what's done is done. I've offered an apology and a chance to look through the results together, but he's shut me down and told me to drop it. \n\nSo I'm at a loss. I understand I have done something hurtful (even unintentionally), but him putting the financial onus on me is just unfair and a little painful.", "Some clarity: the test was initially offered as I'm older (over 30) and the doctor was concerned that there was some risk. The gender marker also just read \"Y chromosome detected? Yes\" so I missed it on the first go around.\n\nThat being said, I recognize that I should've kept my excitement in check. However, what's done, is done. Do you have a suggestion on how I can make this right?

There is no \"making amends,\" as the cat is out of the bag. The reason communication has broken down is because he is disappointed and can't deal with his emotions. It's not for you to fix. He needs to work through it and then come out the other side. If he can't, there are bigger issues. Ignoring your pregnant partner is not how an adult handles their issues.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s serious or not. An adult doesn\u2019t say things like that and have a tantrum. Being disappointed is not an excuse to act out and you\u2019re not a mind reader. I would have done exactly what you did.", "Is he usually like this or could there be something else bothering him? A stressful time at work?", "Give him a few days and then ask if he wants to go look at cribs together.

Either is really not cool. This is your child with him and you should be sharing in both the labor and expenses. Just because you make more than him doesn't mean financial punishment is okay.", "Where I am from, married couples who have children together definitely co-mingle finances.

Those guys are assholes.", "Jesus why would you have a baby with someone who won\u2019t change a diaper?! What a massive arsehole he is.", "Oh he's definitely being unfair. He owes you a sincere apology now too, and that's on him. You're absolutely right there, imo.\n\nHe didn't tell you he wanted to find out together, and you didn't tell him you wanted to find out asap / potentially alone. If I was in his shoes, you finding out alone would communicate to me that you didn't really see me as being part of this process, or didn't really value my role as a parent too. You've told him the same way you might casually tell a friend.\n\nMaybe give him a bit of a breather to process now that he has heard your apology. When he has done that, he needs to acknowledge that what he said is ridiculous and offer you some reassurance in return.", "I think a genuine apology without any excuses or questioning of why he is upset or making him feel like you think he is being silly for caring.

You don't have to make amends OP: you accidentally did something differently to how your husband would have preferred, and then you apologised when he told you that it wasn't his preference. He really needs to grow up quickly!", "I suspect work might be a stressor in his life, and sometimes we talk about it, but he's not very forthcoming about his problems. He tells me that he's frustrated about the commute, the work, the people, etc. all of which is understandable. \n\nI hoped he'd be more excited about the baby we're going to have, though I recognize my part in causing him some hurt.", "I'm not sure what he meant either. Initially, we had planned for my mom and I to shop for things because she would know what to look out for and what to buy. But now I'm not sure if he also wanted to be part of that process too.  \n\n\nHe has some trouble expressing his feelings, so I honestly don't know how he feels about the whole pregnancy. I can tell he's excited because he posts the ultrasound videos on Instagram, but he was very stoic and quiet at the actual in-person appointments. Whenever I ask him for his opinion on, well, anything, he just says that it's \"up to me, since I'm carrying the baby.\" Very confusing.", "Unfortunately, I found out \\*after\\* the fact. I have some experience with caring for babies, but he doesn't seem at all interested in learning more. I didn't think he would be this way, alas.", "I really disagree with this, having been in the same position as OP. A NIPT isn't just about the gender, it's mostly about whether your child has potentially life-ending genetic conditions. The three main ones kill babies within the first year of life. The gender reveal is just a nice bonus. \n\nOP wanting to know as soon as possible whether their child is at risk of serious health conditions should be a given - she's the one carrying the child and the one that would physically have to go through terminating the pregnancy if necessary. At that stage you are constantly thinking and worrying about whether the pregnancy is healthy, so I can't imagine thinking of the results as a nice thing that should be saved and shared together.\n\nShe opened them as soon as possible and let her partner know as soon as possible so they could finally stop worrying that the child might be seriously ill. I didn't wait one minute when I got our results and immediately phoned my husband to let him know everything was OK and that we were having a girl.\n\nHe was so happy, and we could have chosen then to not tell anyone else the gender. It's nothing like casually telling a friend - it's reassuring your partner that your future is going to be OK. \n\nI can understand on some level that her husband is disappointed she found out first, but he's throwing a massive unnecessary hissy fit about it. He should be happy that everything is OK and the fact that he isn't means he didn't grasp how serious this test is and what the consequences could have been. \n\nNTA, at all.", "Thank you for being honest. I realize I may have caused much greater hurt than I anticipated and I feel terrible. It's been a very stressful pregnancy and with the positive results, I might have lost myself there a little. No excuses, however.\n\nAnyway, I will try to give him some space and see where we're at. I want to be able to move on from this and focus on the rest of the pregnancy without further stress <3", "I did that, actually, a little while after. I told him I'm sorry, that I understand, that I'll be more mindful but that was when he told me that he just wants to drop it. So, I'm not sure what to do :(", "Childless, but thats exactly what i was wondering. How is it spoiling the suprise just because she knew it a few hours earlier? Like, couldnt he be suprised by her telling it to him? Why does he insist on having to read it off the chart himself?", "it's not about causing him hurt. \n\nyou're both human and emotions can get out of control. we only know a miniscule part of your relationship. from your post and your response it sounds like there's something else going on that's bothering him and he must not know how to deal with it since he's lashing out. \n\nif this isn't typical behavior for him, it's time to sit down and try to get to the bottom of things. whether you do it with a therapist or just each other, the communication between the two of you needs to improve now, before the baby comes. \n\nbabies can wreak havoc on even the strongest relationships with the upheaval they cause in people's lives. if you don't get on the same page now, it'll only get worse later on. \n\nhe also needs to learn how to process emotions and learn to deal with stress. stress at work is nothing compared to a baby crying at 4 am after only a few hours of sleep.", "I think couple's therapy would be a great place to sort some things out. It's normal to be overwhelmed with a big change like a baby coming and it can absolutely put a strain on relationships. Having a mediator could help you better understand each other.", ">He has some trouble expressing his feelings, so I honestly don't know how he feels about the whole pregnancy.\n\n\nThat's something he needs to work on before your child is born, for your child's sake. Imagine your child does something that upsets him, and he pulls the same tantrum that he's pulling on you right now. Would you still think that's ok?\n\n\nYour husband is about to be a father, OP.

Yeah that's what good fathers do.\n\nI bet you already have examples of him taking offense at shit he could have prevented by talking about it. I bet you already have examples of you apologizing and trying to fix situations that he created. It's going to get worse.\n\nStop apologizing. Start pointing out his lack of communication. Be blunt about what you think and feel when he acts like that. If he keeps being a miserable asshole, call him out.\n\nNTA. He needs to grow the Hell up, preferably *before* the baby is born.", "I think we're actually in agreement for the most part, if I've understood your comment correctly. I totally agree that finding out that the baby is healthy is going to be an asap thing for most people. OP's post reads like she was told all was looking fine over the phone, but chose to read the email with details of the baby's sex. It's that part of this that I don't think was fair without prior discussion, hence the ESH judgement. Totally agreed that the partner's reaction is uncalled for.", "Thank you for being understanding. The test was offered to me as I'm over 30 and with it, the doctor was worried about some potential health risks. I had a series of spotting earlier on in the pregnancy, you can imagine where my mind is at while waiting for the results. I quite literally fell to the floor in relief when the doctor gave me the all clear.\n\nI won't diminish my part in how I may have hurt my husband's feelings, but unless you've been pregnant, you're always wondering about the what-if's because they can happen to anyone.", "I think it\u2019s just time now, unfortunately you can\u2019t rush it. Does he do this often? Give you the silent treatment when he is upset? If so, how do y\u2019all usually move past it?", "Drop it. He's allowed to have his feelings hurt and be upset for a couple of days.", "OK I missed the bit about the phone call. In that case I agree it's a gentle ESH for being too excited about the gender to wait.\n\nEven so, I have no patience with the \"I found out second so this whole baby is ruined\" attitude that OP's husband has. That's bizarre. The baby is their actual child and is going to be around for the rest of their lives, it's not like she spoiled the result of a football game.", "You absolutely are, it's so stressful. Once you can feel the movements as well you're never not anxious about how long it's been since you felt them move. I used to have to time it when I was worried and it was never more than about 20min but in my head it had been ages!\n\nYes, you did hurt his feelings by looking at the gender instead of waiting. But he should be way, way happier that the baby is healthy than angry that you found out the gender before him. He is overreacting big time!", "He does. Just a couple days ago he blew up at me because I forgotten to bring a thumbdrive when we were scanning some documents for his dad. (He had one in his work bag anyway) \n\nHe normally cools down after a day and only starts talking when I do, usually when I ask what he wants to eat.", "It really is bizarre, isn't it? It's like a toddler getting frustrated with a toy and throwing it. I'm finding it hard to imagine how this man thinks he's mature enough and well regulated enough to be a parent.", "Does he need a day to cool down because he got agitated about something so minor like you forgetting a usb-drive which wasn\u2019t even a problem? \n\nI don\u2019t wanna read to much into that situation, but I\u2019ve got the feeling that your husband has some regulatory problems regarding his anger management."]}
