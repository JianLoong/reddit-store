We had to change the date because of a scheduling conflict with the best man so figured that we would just move the wedding to the following Saturday. This happens to be one of my bridesmaids birthdays. I jokingly texted her asking if she\u2019s okay with my wedding being moved to that date and she sort of flipped out. I did not expect her response. She started off by making comments like \u201cyou better sing happy birthday to me and I expect a cupcake.\u201d Then a few hours later she sent me this: \n\n\u201cNo that's not true I don't want to lie to you. I guess it does hurt a little I don't want to be selfish or make you feel bad. I don't really feel like there is a way to say no. I guess I'm a little hurt because it's a huge birthday it's gonna be my 30th and I was hoping to do something special for it and I will lose that weekend because there will be so much going on with the wedding. I'm not angry but I am a little sad. I don't want to be selfish but I just wanted to say it because I didn't want to not say anything and let it fester. \u201c\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: best man conflict. He is already in another wedding that weekend out of town. He got the dates mixed up he was willing to take an Uber after our wedding to make it to the next and we decided to move it he did not ask us to. He is a member of the grooms family so this one was non negotiable. \n\nShe can chose to come to my wedding if she wants or celebrate her birthday her own way I would never hold that against her. I would rather her do that then come and be upset the entire time and feel like she missed out.\n\nEdit: I have already made several changes to me wedding plan to accommodate her. She is really tight on money so I picked cheap bridesmaid dresses and I am covering the cost of her hair, makeup, hotel, etc. for the day. I can\u2019t afford to do this for all of my bridesmaids but I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad about not being in the wedding because of money. I\u2019m the most hurt about her saying she\u2019s sad and that the Weekend would go to waste. Her and her partner would have had all of their meals paid for the entire weekend.\nEdit: My 30th birthday is a few days after hers. We have been friends for 20 years and we have never made a big deal about our birthdays. That was the whole point of me joking about the wedding being on her birthday. For years we both ignored our birthdays for the most part and joked about how ridiculous birthdays are. Which is also why I didn\u2019t expect her to feel this way. \nAlso for those asking about the weekend before we would lose some vendors. But the venue has this date available it\u2019s another option we are floating around with the venue to try to make things work and replace the vendors. We haven\u2019t booked the date of her birthday it is the first choice for the reschedule and the second is the weekend prior if we can swing new vendors within the next few days. \nThe date is off season because it\u2019s what we can afford. I didn\u2019t pick this date specifically it was the date offered to us from the venue that lined up with our vendors.", "created_utc": 1671512164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqewpq/aita_for_booking_my_wedding_on_my_bridesmaids/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You moved the date because of a scheduling conflict with the best man and in doing so, created a scheduling conflict with your bridesmaid. And for some reason, that is okay with you.\n\n2. You made a joke out of it, expected her to play along and was surprised when she didn't. Again with the not caring.\n\n3. This bridesmaid is supposedly close enough to be part of your wedding party. But now instead of celebrating her special day and a milestone birthday at that, you want her to be part of celebrating yours? And it won't be just the one day. Next year it will be your 1st wedding anniversary on her birthday and the next and the next. \n\n4. You moved the wedding date once. Why can't you move it again? \n\n\nGood on the bridesmaid for not hiding her true feelings, like you expected her to. I'd be evaluating where I stood with you, if I were her. And reconsidering some things going forward. \n\nYTA", " YTA. If this person is important enough to you that you\u2019ve put them in your wedding then it should be important to you that you honor her milestone bday. You changed the date for another member of your bridal party. Choose a different date that doesn\u2019t fall on your friend\u2019s birthday. Especially since you asked her and she told you she does care. Honestly, pretty crummy that you put her in that spot to begin with.", "Kudos to your bridesmaid for kindly and gently being honest with you.  She seems mature and respectful.\n\nOp, your wedding is important to you, Not so much everyone else.  It\u2019s a dick move to prioritize one person in your bridal party\u2019s schedule over another.  And it\u2019s selfish to expect your friend to sacrifice her milestone birthday weekend for one that revolves entirely around you.  It would be one thing if you were in a position where no other date worked, but your wedding is a year and a half away, with lots of options available. This reads like you kind of carelessly picked this date, with the attitude your friend should just suck it up and enjoy the free food.", "YTA It's a milestone birthday, no one wants to spend a milestone birthday at someone else's wedding. And you KNEW it was her birthday when you booked the venue. And it's not just a guest, it's a bridesmaid. Her entire day revolves around catering to you.\n\nOf course you're the asshole here. How can you not see that?! And you \"jokingly\" texted her to see if it was okay? You don't even care that you're the asshole. Be honest, you just came here hoping people would side with you and make you feel better, didn't you? It's honestly your attitude about the whole thing that really irks me.", "YTA. You already rescheduled once because someone in the wedding party had a conflict. You still have a conflict. Pick another date.\n\nEDIT: Double YTA based on your edits. You volunteered to reschedule your wedding for her birthday so that someone else who screwed up the dates wouldn't have to rush from one event to another. Guess you got your revenge on her for having to buy those cheap bridesmaid dresses, huh?", "I mean, if you knew it was her birthday, then yeah, YTA. Kinda sounds like you did, then joked about whether or not she was OK with it.\n\nYes, you are entitled to schedule your wedding whenever you want to, but you changed it because of a scheduling conflict with the best man, and completely disregarded a possible scheduling conflict with your bridesmaid. \n\nYTA", "Yta\n\nShe said \"it would be sad to lose that weekend\" because she is losing it. This is YOUR wedding , not hers.  You will remember this day as the happiest day of your life. She will remember her 30th as the day her friend said fuck your feelings, cater to ME on MY wedding day. She told you in the most respectful manner. Change it. You needed a discount price for the venue so bringing up finances seems pointless. You asked her. Not the other way around.", "Soft YTA. Scheduling a wedding is hard and with things like venues and other things the dates you can schedule it are pretty limited. But, I can see her frustration if you were willing to move the wedding for a conflict for the best man....and then moved it to a day you knew would be a conflict for her. Yeah, she can suck it up and celebrate her birthday officially another weekend, but I can see why it would make her sad.\n\nMy friend's brother has been engaged for 3 years now and didn't really care about a wedding....then two months ago announced they were getting married and their date was my friend's 40th birthday. Not a huge deal, but also pretty rude. He'd had some birthday plans that he then had to reschedule (hotels booked for an out of town trip) and such. He was happy for it and got over it, but we also all agreed that his brother was being inconsiderate and selfish.\n\nETA: I just reread and saw this was for a date in 2024...yeah, you're definitely the asshole here.", "YTA, your 30th birthday is a milestone occasion. My cousin got married the same day I graduated HS and none of my family attended my ceremony b/c they were busy with the wedding day(parents didn\u2019t come)we celebrated the next day with leftovers from the wedding.

Why is groomsman's inconvenience more important than bridesmaid's one and only 30th birthday? I'm sure you'll get married again, you sounds too selfish and oblivious to make a marriage last, but she'll never turn 30 again. I'd drop out of the wedding, were I her.", "YTA you knew it was her birthday.  \n\nWhen I am asked to be part of a wedding party I agree because they are important to me and I am important to them.   That the bit see you are dismissing her feelings of wanting to be there but that means you being there for her when you known her so long and care enough her to invite.  \nYes she could not attend but then she would miss out having you whom she cares about in her big celebration. \n\nAlso not being funny wedding is not just the day is it.  It takes over months:weeks for those involved.\n\nI must thank all my friends for not being such an ass to do this to me I would have to express myself they would not do this.", "NAH. You had to reschedule and that date was close and worked. It\u2019s your wedding.\n\nShe\u2019s being a genuine friend and respecting you enough to tell you the truth. It\u2019s the kind of thing that, if she just swallowed and tried to ignore, would probably do more harm.\n\nYou didn\u2019t \u201cexpect\u201d her response? You only texted her \u201cjokingly\u201d? Why would that be a joke? That behavior seems a bit flippant and self-absorbed. Your wedding may be your DAYYYYYY but it doesn\u2019t - and shouldn\u2019t - matter even a 1/10th (or less) as much to everyone except you and your fianc\u00e9. \n\n I think you should appreciate and respect her honesty. She seems to behave like a more thoughtful friend than you do.\n\nNow that I\u2019m writing this I\u2019m leaning a little more towards YTA.

You just showed you don\u2019t value your friend. You changed the date for a groomsmen but don\u2019t care about her. Just because you didn\u2019t celebrate birthdays in the past doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t want to.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to have this friend after the wedding if you continue to treat her this way", "NAH\n\n\nYou\u2019re free to schedule your wedding whenever you like, and she\u2019s free to celebrate her birthday instead of your wedding if she\u2019d prefer. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to schedule around everyone\u2019s everything.", "INFO: what are hours for the wedding?

It was awesome that she did that since she knows that my birthday is a big deal to me. \n\nAlso, hilariously, my anniversary is on her birthday, so she chose the date on purpose, so that we could always say \u201cHappy Anniversary\u201d on each other\u2019s birthdays, and vice versa.", "YTA - it doesn't matter if your paying for all this stuff for her to attend your wedding etc, insinuating she should just be happy with it and accept it for her bday. The whole point is the wedding has limelight on you, and the bday should have limelight on her. There is no way you can share that light like that.", "NAH. Get her a cupcake, sing happy birthday. Do something special for her 30th. Who says only one good thing can be celebrated at a time?", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like the best man didn\u2019t ask you to move the wedding; you chose to in order to accommodate him and in doing so, are inconveniencing a friend of two decades. 30th birthdays are milestones so even if she doesn\u2019t usually celebrate doesn\u2019t mean that she will never want to celebrate. You\u2019re prioritising a wedding party member *who had figured out his own solution*, knowing it would impact another member of your wedding party. Friend or family, this is impacting someone you love. \n\nShe has been gracious and honest in her response to you, so unless she has a history of dragging out issues after raising them, I think you\u2019re blowing this out of proportion. \n\nEither you can move the date, or you can\u2019t, and either she can live with it, or she can\u2019t. What you definitely can\u2019t do is control her feelings and reaction - it sounds like you\u2019re more mad that she didn\u2019t react in the way you wanted her to, which is what makes you TA.", "NAH - I personally would just do something for my 30th either a week before or after. Wedding trumps 30th birthday IMO with the effort involved and lengths needed to go into planning it but at the same time, she has communicated openly, respectfully and honestly and it's pretty reasonable given it was moved for the best man.\n\nAs others have said, apologizing and re-affirming that's you dont have much of a choice with the date then doing something really nice for her on the day would probably the best course of action.", "NAH. Adults being so obsessed with their birthdays sincerely baffles me.", "NAH - I got married on my brother's birthday. It made it easier to remember my anniversary.", "NAH. So, you need to keep your costs down so you're limited to the off-season, and they only have 3 days available. The first you chose and apparently set up vendors for is a conflict for the best man, who's a family member of your groom, so it's understandable that date doesn't work. The next date is a bridesmaid's 30th birthday, but in your 2 decade friendship neither of you have celebrated birthdays so you didn't anticipate she'd celebrated this one either, but she's indicated she wants to. The final date available may not work if you can't get vendors since some you've chosen can't do that date. \n\nIf you really want this bridesmaid in your wedding, which it sounds like you do based on everything you've done so far to help her be there, I'd suggest talking to her about her birthday on your wedding weekend - apologize for assuming she wouldn't want to celebrate since neither of you have before, and talk about whether she wants to participate in your wedding if you include a celebration of her birthday (if that's something you'd want to do) or if she'd rather not be in your wedding at all so she can celebrate how she'd like (does she have family or friends she wants to celebrate with that won't be at your wedding?), and any other options. Work thru it together so it's not all on her to decide.", "NTA sorry you have to deal with the drama. Sounds like you are doing a lot to accommodate her. She could have been equally happy that you chose her birthday as your special day.", "Has she not celebrated 28 other birthdays? People take it way too seriously.  The friend can make a choice.

Is she finally in a position where she can celebrate her life in a big way and feel emotionally safe/ accomplished to do so?", "I think we are the only two going with NTA. Prepare yourself - the downvotes are coming lol", "Then pick the week prior\u2026.", "She probably thought the joke was that you were planning to do it on her birthday and then realized you were serious", "But you are angry that she's upset. That makes you an asshole.", "I didn't get her looking down on her. They're all skint. She seems to want her friend (ex friend?) to be grateful for the extra she is spending on her though, which you can't really expect when ultimately it's for her benefit, not her friends.", "Yeah honestly who does anniversary parties? I've literally been to one in my life and it was my grandparents' 50th. I can see why that was worth celebrating.", "But that would inconvenience the best man, and we wouldn\u2019t want that! /s", "Lol. Confirmation of how self-centred you are. 'What does your friend get from this friendship?''Well, I don't force her to do one more additional thing for me'.", "Exactly!  The hair and makeup is for the sake of OP\u2019s photos and wedding esthetic- it\u2019s not like OP is springing for a spa day for the friend", "Well it might be that I'm seeing something that isn't there. \n\nBut when I commented before I saw a response from OP clearly highlighting how she had made things easier for her friend, choosing less expensive options and paying for some things (which she should do regardless if she wanted to have input on them!).\n\nOP commented later(?) how they're forced to choose out of specific dates due to financial reasons. So they brought up how they kindly helped out their less fortunate friend (who should now be full of gratefulness for OPs kindness and charity) and OP conveniently did not mention that they aren't well off either (needing that discount).\n\nThat might have even bought some goodwill to OP but nahh, much more important to mention that OPs friend wasn't able to commit as much money to OPs wedding as OP would have liked.\n\nMaybe I'm seeing things that aren't there. But I'm not getting really good impression of OP so it just struck me a bit funny (ironic maybe, not haha funny) how OPs priorities are all kinds of messed up in my opinion.\n\nShe's after all saying that she would have otherwise chosen more expensive stuff but because of her friend she couldn't (which clearly was an inconvenience since she felt the need to bring it up on AITA). But here she is, not affording the expensive venue herself without discounts. Which is inconvenience to her (not being able to freely decide the date) and for her guests since the first date wasn't good for one and the second date option is on her friend's birthday.", "My point was that an adult understands that sometimes other things take precedent. It sounds like the bridesmaid is a very old friend. An old friend would be happy to be invited to be a bridesmaid and schedule a birthday party a different weekend. Maybe its a cultural thing but if someone dropped out of being a bridesmaid or sent the kind of message that bridesmaid sent over a wedding being scheduled the same day as their birthday then they would be absolutely ridiculed by any friends and family who heard about it.\n\nEdit: Saying I'm invalidating those that do is a massive reach.", "Wait is the bed man conflict not what she called the original date?", "The previous commenters point is that it would only be a joke if you weren't planning your wedding on her 30th birthday. But you were and you are. So it's not a joke? Unless you are able to explain the joke, (although if you have to explain it, it still isn't funny).\n\nArranging a serious conversation about your plans to rearrange your wedding to coincide with her milestone birthday is the bare minimum. Choosing not to suggests that you don't care that much about your friend's feelings and/or emotional immaturity.", "If she picks the week prior to the best man conflict, now she\u2019s going to have to remember a whole new date instead of just remembering 1 date that covers her friend\u2019s birthday and her anniversary. Clearly that is much more important than taking her friend into consideration. Only the best man and the bride matter in planning a wedding obviously! Lol", "I thought you meant pick the week prior to the bridesmaid\u2019s birthday and the date of the best man conflict.", "I personally feel (have a very strong inkling?) OP has already chosen the date. Maybe she was offered more dates, but I think it\u2019s already been settled by the way she responds. \n\nIf it was WIBTA I think she would have relented by now, but the fact she already texted the girl and how much she is pushing back I think it\u2019s already settled. \n\nI\u2019ve been in wedding and have heard so much about weddings. Flowers and invites and all sorts of stuff are tricky, particular, and time consuming. One week push back may be annoying, but possible for many vendors to work within their already planned schedule and prices. Having the wedding out a couple months makes it harder. BUT ULTIMATELY this is her friend of 20 years and she should have been prioritized over flowers and additional surcharges if the option was there and she was changing it all for another human.", "But how will OP be able to outshine her friend on her if she can\u2019t make their mutual friends pick OP over friend?  I hope if OP keeps the date, she\u2019s prepared for some mutual friends to ditch the reception after dinner for the friend\u2019s party bus.", "She doesn't  know  if the weekend previous would  work for the vendors . If it doesn't  this date would be the  one all works for op s wedding.  As I see it she is trying  still to make it work on the previous week so nta imo."]}
