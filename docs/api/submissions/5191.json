We had to change the date because of a scheduling conflict with the best man so figured that we would just move the wedding to the following Saturday. This happens to be one of my bridesmaids birthdays. I jokingly texted her asking if she\u2019s okay with my wedding being moved to that date and she sort of flipped out. I did not expect her response. She started off by making comments like \u201cyou better sing happy birthday to me and I expect a cupcake.\u201d Then a few hours later she sent me this: \n\n\u201cNo that's not true I don't want to lie to you. I guess it does hurt a little I don't want to be selfish or make you feel bad. I don't really feel like there is a way to say no. I guess I'm a little hurt because it's a huge birthday it's gonna be my 30th and I was hoping to do something special for it and I will lose that weekend because there will be so much going on with the wedding. I'm not angry but I am a little sad. I don't want to be selfish but I just wanted to say it because I didn't want to not say anything and let it fester. \u201c\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: best man conflict. He is already in another wedding that weekend out of town. He got the dates mixed up he was willing to take an Uber after our wedding to make it to the next and we decided to move it he did not ask us to. He is a member of the grooms family so this one was non negotiable. \n\nShe can chose to come to my wedding if she wants or celebrate her birthday her own way I would never hold that against her. I would rather her do that then come and be upset the entire time and feel like she missed out.\n\nEdit: I have already made several changes to me wedding plan to accommodate her. She is really tight on money so I picked cheap bridesmaid dresses and I am covering the cost of her hair, makeup, hotel, etc. for the day. I can\u2019t afford to do this for all of my bridesmaids but I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad about not being in the wedding because of money. I\u2019m the most hurt about her saying she\u2019s sad and that the Weekend would go to waste. Her and her partner would have had all of their meals paid for the entire weekend.\nEdit: My 30th birthday is a few days after hers. We have been friends for 20 years and we have never made a big deal about our birthdays. That was the whole point of me joking about the wedding being on her birthday. For years we both ignored our birthdays for the most part and joked about how ridiculous birthdays are. Which is also why I didn\u2019t expect her to feel this way. \nAlso for those asking about the weekend before we would lose some vendors. But the venue has this date available it\u2019s another option we are floating around with the venue to try to make things work and replace the vendors. We haven\u2019t booked the date of her birthday it is the first choice for the reschedule and the second is the weekend prior if we can swing new vendors within the next few days. \nThe date is off season because it\u2019s what we can afford. I didn\u2019t pick this date specifically it was the date offered to us from the venue that lined up with our vendors.\n\n******thanks for y\u2019all\u2019s honesty. To the people sending my death threats in my inbox over a wedding date YTA. I would rather lose vendors/deposits than lose a friend. After she sent that message yesterday I told her that I was going to change the date and she apologized and told me not to so I didn\u2019t know how to take it. We spoke and told each other how we felt. She has a lot going on and it\u2019s about more than just a birthday for her so I\u2019m glad we had that conversation. The venue no longer has the Saturday before available. We are going to cancel the wedding for now and see what we can do regarding deposits. I can\u2019t get married on her birthday as she stressed to me that it would ruin our friendship. My fianc\u00e9 and I got pressured into having a wedding by our families so we see this as a sign to do what feels right to us and not appease them. ****", "created_utc": 1671512164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqewpq/aita_for_booking_my_wedding_on_my_bridesmaids/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You moved the date because of a scheduling conflict with the best man and in doing so, created a scheduling conflict with your bridesmaid. And for some reason, that is okay with you.\n\n2. You made a joke out of it, expected her to play along and was surprised when she didn't. Again with the not caring.\n\n3. This bridesmaid is supposedly close enough to be part of your wedding party. But now instead of celebrating her special day and a milestone birthday at that, you want her to be part of celebrating yours? And it won't be just the one day. Next year it will be your 1st wedding anniversary on her birthday and the next and the next. \n\n4. You moved the wedding date once. Why can't you move it again? \n\n\nGood on the bridesmaid for not hiding her true feelings, like you expected her to. I'd be evaluating where I stood with you, if I were her. And reconsidering some things going forward. \n\nYTA", " YTA. If this person is important enough to you that you\u2019ve put them in your wedding then it should be important to you that you honor her milestone bday. You changed the date for another member of your bridal party. Choose a different date that doesn\u2019t fall on your friend\u2019s birthday. Especially since you asked her and she told you she does care. Honestly, pretty crummy that you put her in that spot to begin with.", "Kudos to your bridesmaid for kindly and gently being honest with you.  She seems mature and respectful.\n\nOp, your wedding is important to you, Not so much everyone else.  It\u2019s a dick move to prioritize one person in your bridal party\u2019s schedule over another.  And it\u2019s selfish to expect your friend to sacrifice her milestone birthday weekend for one that revolves entirely around you.  It would be one thing if you were in a position where no other date worked, but your wedding is a year and a half away, with lots of options available. This reads like you kind of carelessly picked this date, with the attitude your friend should just suck it up and enjoy the free food.", "YTA It's a milestone birthday, no one wants to spend a milestone birthday at someone else's wedding. And you KNEW it was her birthday when you booked the venue. And it's not just a guest, it's a bridesmaid. Her entire day revolves around catering to you.\n\nOf course you're the asshole here. How can you not see that?! And you \"jokingly\" texted her to see if it was okay? You don't even care that you're the asshole. Be honest, you just came here hoping people would side with you and make you feel better, didn't you? It's honestly your attitude about the whole thing that really irks me.", "YTA. You already rescheduled once because someone in the wedding party had a conflict. You still have a conflict. Pick another date.\n\nEDIT: Double YTA based on your edits. You volunteered to reschedule your wedding for her birthday so that someone else who screwed up the dates wouldn't have to rush from one event to another. Guess you got your revenge on her for having to buy those cheap bridesmaid dresses, huh?", "I mean, if you knew it was her birthday, then yeah, YTA. Kinda sounds like you did, then joked about whether or not she was OK with it.\n\nYes, you are entitled to schedule your wedding whenever you want to, but you changed it because of a scheduling conflict with the best man, and completely disregarded a possible scheduling conflict with your bridesmaid. \n\nYTA", "Yta\n\nShe said \"it would be sad to lose that weekend\" because she is losing it. This is YOUR wedding , not hers.  You will remember this day as the happiest day of your life. She will remember her 30th as the day her friend said fuck your feelings, cater to ME on MY wedding day. She told you in the most respectful manner. Change it. You needed a discount price for the venue so bringing up finances seems pointless. You asked her. Not the other way around.", "Soft YTA. Scheduling a wedding is hard and with things like venues and other things the dates you can schedule it are pretty limited. But, I can see her frustration if you were willing to move the wedding for a conflict for the best man....and then moved it to a day you knew would be a conflict for her. Yeah, she can suck it up and celebrate her birthday officially another weekend, but I can see why it would make her sad.\n\nMy friend's brother has been engaged for 3 years now and didn't really care about a wedding....then two months ago announced they were getting married and their date was my friend's 40th birthday. Not a huge deal, but also pretty rude. He'd had some birthday plans that he then had to reschedule (hotels booked for an out of town trip) and such.

I'd drop out of the wedding, were I her.", "YTA you knew it was her birthday.  \n\nWhen I am asked to be part of a wedding party I agree because they are important to me and I am important to them.   That the bit see you are dismissing her feelings of wanting to be there but that means you being there for her when you known her so long and care enough her to invite.  \nYes she could not attend but then she would miss out having you whom she cares about in her big celebration. \n\nAlso not being funny wedding is not just the day is it.

You had to reschedule and that date was close and worked. It\u2019s your wedding.\n\nShe\u2019s being a genuine friend and respecting you enough to tell you the truth.

Do something special for her 30th. Who says only one good thing can be celebrated at a time?", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like the best man didn\u2019t ask you to move the wedding; you chose to in order to accommodate him and in doing so, are inconveniencing a friend of two decades. 30th birthdays are milestones so even if she doesn\u2019t usually celebrate doesn\u2019t mean that she will never want to celebrate. You\u2019re prioritising a wedding party member *who had figured out his own solution*, knowing it would impact another member of your wedding party.

What you definitely can\u2019t do is control her feelings and reaction - it sounds like you\u2019re more mad that she didn\u2019t react in the way you wanted her to, which is what makes you TA.", "NAH - I personally would just do something for my 30th either a week before or after. Wedding trumps 30th birthday IMO with the effort involved and lengths needed to go into planning it but at the same time, she has communicated openly, respectfully and honestly and it's pretty reasonable given it was moved for the best man.\n\nAs others have said, apologizing and re-affirming that's you dont have much of a choice with the date then doing something really nice for her on the day would probably the best course of action.", "NAH. Adults being so obsessed with their birthdays sincerely baffles me.", "NAH - I got married on my brother's birthday. It made it easier to remember my anniversary.", "NAH. So, you need to keep your costs down so you're limited to the off-season, and they only have 3 days available. The first you chose and apparently set up vendors for is a conflict for the best man, who's a family member of your groom, so it's understandable that date doesn't work. The next date is a bridesmaid's 30th birthday, but in your 2 decade friendship neither of you have celebrated birthdays so you didn't anticipate she'd celebrated this one either, but she's indicated she wants to. The final date available may not work if you can't get vendors since some you've chosen can't do that date. \n\nIf you really want this bridesmaid in your wedding, which it sounds like you do based on everything you've done so far to help her be there, I'd suggest talking to her about her birthday on your wedding weekend - apologize for assuming she wouldn't want to celebrate since neither of you have before, and talk about whether she wants to participate in your wedding if you include a celebration of her birthday (if that's something you'd want to do) or if she'd rather not be in your wedding at all so she can celebrate how she'd like (does she have family or friends she wants to celebrate with that won't be at your wedding?), and any other options. Work thru it together so it's not all on her to decide.", "NTA sorry you have to deal with the drama. Sounds like you are doing a lot to accommodate her.

So they brought up how they kindly helped out their less fortunate friend (who should now be full of gratefulness for OPs kindness and charity) and OP conveniently did not mention that they aren't well off either (needing that discount).\n\nThat might have even bought some goodwill to OP but nahh, much more important to mention that OPs friend wasn't able to commit as much money to OPs wedding as OP would have liked.\n\nMaybe I'm seeing things that aren't there. But I'm not getting really good impression of OP so it just struck me a bit funny (ironic maybe, not haha funny) how OPs priorities are all kinds of messed up in my opinion.\n\nShe's after all saying that she would have otherwise chosen more expensive stuff but because of her friend she couldn't (which clearly was an inconvenience since she felt the need to bring it up on AITA).

I understand the nuances of the couple already having moved the date once, but I don't think their actions rise to the level of being the AH here. I DO think that OP should have a heart to heart with her friend & let her know that she's OK with whatever she chooses & that she wants to celebrate both her birth & her friendship with her, & if she decides to come to the wedding, to make a point of doing something to call attention to the significance of the day for the Bridesmaid. My husband & I flew to Ireland to celebrate my cousin's wedding,  which took place on Hubby's birthday. We had planned something for the following day (which he adamantly was fine with because how often do you have to wait for a get together due to work, commitments etc anyway) & at the reception, my cousin surprised my husband with a cake & everyone sang Happy Birthday.
