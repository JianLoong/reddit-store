I would be big mad too. \n\nI believe that once is a sufficient amount to tell someone what your boundary is.

Yeah, he shouldn\u2019t use your towel.

I do think you need to effectively communicate, calmly, that this is something that\u2019s important to you. It\u2019s something you want him to respect about you. That said, it sounds like you might need to invest in some additional towels, so that he doesn\u2019t use yours. Clearly define the towels that are his (such as a different color).

Absolutely stand up for yourself. Always! But that doesn't mean yelling and intentionally giving the silent treatment. Neither of those are effective communication tools and neither are going to get your point across. If it's a deal breaker pack your shit and leave, if not have the conversation again. If you've had the conversation too much and it's not changing, leave.", "Well not that they would admit to you...\ud83e\udd23", "How could you possibly know the towel laundering habits of everyone you've ever met?", "I\u2019ve definitely gone for like a month", "Not to mention mildew *loves* growing on towels that are left damp.", "Wait, but she has to get STDs test ASAP. Maybe he cheated on her with other towels. And don't forget to contact her neighbour, in case he used his towel.", "I don\u2019t do this (I just use one towel\u2026), but understanding where OP is coming from\u2014 unless you change that towel every day, the next time you dry your face, you\u2019re using the towel that touched yesterday\u2019s asscrack.", "Acne has nothing to do with being unclean.", "So, a self-admitted strawman?  Great.  Love that you used physical abuse as a convenient crutch for a slippery slope argument that makes no sense.  Very classy.\n\nI'm going to turn your extreme example around.  I told him not to use my towels, but he did it anyway.  I told him not to hit me, but he did it anyway.  See how ridiculous it is?\n\nI hate when other people touch my laundry.  I don't know why, I just do.  It makes me anxious and uncomfortable.  If my wife or roommate or whoever decided to just move my laundry without asking me because it was convenient at the time, I'd be upset.  I'd probably be snappy.  Not touching my laundry is a boundary we set up a long time ago.  Is it weird?  Sure.  Does my wife necessarily understand it?  No.  Does she still respect my boundary of not touching my laundry?  Of course.\n\nAnother great thing about relationships is that we find someone to accept us for who we are and teach us to love and accept ourselves too.  There's a lot of great things about relationships, and none of them apply to every single situation.  Abuse requires repeated actions.  BF fucked up once and crossed a boundary, she fucked up and yelled.  Domestic abuse has no place in this single situation and it was distasteful to try and use it to further your point.\n\nMy \"rule\" is simple.\nDO NOT LET PEOPLE IGNORE YOUR BOUNDARIES.  Whether it's not to use your towel or not to punch your nose, boundaries are boundaries and should be respected.", "Bigger question....why does she need a FULL SIZED towel for her face and only her face??\nThey make smaller, perfect for just face sized towels...", "How does anyone forget to flush?", "Forgets to flush?

Kids just went back to college, and stores are trying to move products to get ready for Christmas", "Shop around and just keep an eye out especially at Christmas and back to school time.  Or just after a holiday look for the holiday themed set.  Do you really care if there's a leaf pattern on your nice soft towels if it saves you $10 on a full set?\n\nThe flipp app is a beautiful thing if you use it regularly.  I don't have target or tjmaxx as I'm Canadian, but it's the same idea.  I have no clue whether you guys have Winners or Home Sense, but that's where a lot of my towels came from.  They've often got sets for $10 or less there.  A little effort and my towels are actually all pretty closely matched colour wise.\n\nIkea towels aren't bad actually, I have two that are around 5 years old and aren't showing it yet.  They're thinner than the four that were from the local bay when it was going out of business that are way older, but for $2 a towel on clearance I can live with that.  I hate thin fabrics. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I like clearance racks and store closing sales.

You peeps are really looking for something to be mad at.  \n\nPoint 1. Just because something is unimportant to one person doesn't invalid its importance to someone else.  When you have any sort of relationship with someone (romantic, platonic, whatever), the things that are important to that person matter.\n\nPoint 2.  Boundaries are important and shouldn't be broken without prior discussion.\n\nI'm getting the feeling a lot of people are mad because someone called using one towel gross.  Calm down, just because someone thinks it's gross doesn't mean it is.  I think burping with your mouth open is nasty, but it doesn't mean people who do it are nasty.", "I get up to pee  at  least 3 times a night and I'm not trying to wake everyone up every 2-3 hours so I don't flush my pee at night.
