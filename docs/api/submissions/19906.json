We met through a mutual friend and we get along really well. The work I'm passionate about does not pay well if you don't have a high enough job, which I do not have right now. My boyfriend works at his dad's very successful company and will take over for his father when he decides to retire which means he makes a lot more money than I do. This is not usually an issue in our relationship, I like to try to even things out but he says he likes spoiling me. The problem is that lately we have been discussing marriage and my boyfriend says he is hesitant to marry a woman who makes so much less than him. He says this is because he grew up with a gold digger mother and doesn't want to repeat his father's mistakes. When we first started dating his dad was very wary of me but we have a very good relationship right now and even he says his son is being ridiculous. \n\nLast weekend my best friend 30F got married and I was the maid of honor. It was a lot of fun and I thought everything was perfect for her special day. I was getting a little sad that my boyfriend didn't seem to let this convince him marriage is a good idea but I wasn't going to push him on such a happy day. When it came time for her to toss the bridal bouquet she gathered all of the bridesmaids and I ended up catching it. My best friend made a light joke about how maybe I really would be next but my boyfriend and I just laughed it off. I didn't think anything of it and went on with the rest of the night. In the car home my boyfriend blew up at me and said I was pressuring him into something he wasn't sure about. He said my best friend and I made him very uncomfortable and he didn't like that I had brought her into a private matter. \n\nI told my best friend that he didn't want to marry me a few weeks ago and she thought it was very strange and that he should go to a therapist for his commitment issues. When I told him this he was adamant that he would not be going to a therapist because he didn't need one. He brought this argument up in the car and said that I shouldn't have let her interfere and that he knew we had planned this to get him to propose. We did not plan this, I just happened to be in the right place and I don't really believe in the bouquet superstition anyway, it was just a fun thing for the bridesmaids to do together. \n\nHis friends agreed I shouldn't have caught it or even participated but my best friend thinks he's being dramatic, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1687026750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14by60f/aita_for_catching_the_bridal_bouquet/", "score": 456, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re fully in the right, and his reason for not wanting to marry you is paranoid and absurd, but at the same time trying to pressure him into changing his mind will probably make him resent you if he does eventually cave. Unfortunatley I think your differing views on marriage does not make you very compatible. You want marriage, he has no interest in marrying you(for a ludicrous reason).

Really?", "Your boyfriend is over-reacting to you catching the bouquet.\n\nYou both need to go to pre-marriage counseling and work these issues out in a moderated environment; otherwise, these conflicts will degenerate into yelling and screaming matches.\n\nAnd stop repeating to him what your best friend says about him.

He seems really fearful about commitment and he basically called you a gold digger! I really don\u2019t think it will be a good idea to get into a marriage with him because even if you guys went to therapy I personally feel like he will still have this thought in the back of his head and it will affect the marriage.

It's a meaningless thing.\n\nYou would be an asshole if you stayed with this jerk though.  The irony of someone who is only successful thanks to nepotism standing on the shoulders of other people's hard work complaining about and low-key implying you're a gold-digger is so thick you could chew it.\n\nHe doesn't want to marry you.  Period.  Take the hint, get out, and find yourself someone who isn't an asshole.  He doesn't have \"commitment issues\" - he just doesn't want to commit to you.  He flat out told you that he doesn't deem you successful enough to be worthy of the \"honor\" of being his wife.   At this point, he's just being horrible so you'll break up with him so he doesn't have to do the dirty work and he can say he was right all along and you broke up with him because you wanted his (daddy's) money.  Have some self-respect and stop subjecting yourself to this self-absorbed, materialistic jerk.", "NTA but your bf sure has issues.

I fear he won\u2019t treat you very well or trust you if you do get hitched. These are his insecurities that he needs to either work on or frankly, he doesn\u2019t see you as the ONE. He shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to marry you - he should happily be wanting to put a ring on it after this long. \n\nI would be incredibly offended if my PARTNER OF THREE YEARS thought of me as a gold digger - it shows how little they think of me or know me. So gross. Find someone better who actually respects you. He clearly does not!", "NTA. He's the one being dramatic. Now is a really good time to discuss what you both want out of the future.

Three years.  What a toad he is.", "NTA. It seems your bf is TA. He also seems narcissist and is using future faking to get you to stay. He is putting a Carrot on a stick. You are forced to act your best for years to wait for him to make up his mind about wanting you. You deserve better . Read about narcissist and how they use future faking to manipulate and get you to do what they want . Right now you could be already married with someone who appreciates you and trusts you", "NTA. He calls his own Mom a gold digger. He clearly thinks he is better than anyone who makes less money than he does. That's not going to change. He's wrong but may never see it. \n\nFind someone who loves you for who you are and what you have.", "NTA This would have to have been well planned blind aim on the bride's part, lol. Umm... so he doesn't want to go to therapy... will he go to couples counciling from a pastor or an officiant? That's kinda also part of the job as well. It's not therapy technically, but it is an open forum to discuss these things with a non-biased 3rd party. If you're not religious, it just can be an officiant.", "NTA\n\nTimeline is a bit messy, and I could be reading you wrong. Sounds like your BF got upset at the mere fact you caught the bouquet. Your friend put the pressure on. You could have alleviated that by assuring your BF it's just a tradition and this doesn't mean you're wanting to be married any time soon. But you just participated in a wedding event, being the MOH it would be weird if you weren't there. \n\nUnsolicited advice: couples counseling can be very valuable for unmarried people. Sounds like y'all need to understand each other otherwise you are going to read into his protests as: he doesn't want to marry you rather than just not wanting to be married. He is going to read all of your pressure as: you just wanting to be married and not wanting to marry him for him.", "Of course, NTA. He's hesitant in marrying a woman who makes so much less than him? No. The gender income disparity in our culture is well known. I think he doesn't want to marry you and is using the income differential as an excuse. I hope you let him go.", "NTA. Jeez, you caught a bouquet and laughed with your best friend at a joke she made about it.", "When people tell you who they are, listen. \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t marry someone who calls you a gold digger and is so self-centered they\u2019re capable of making a bouquet toss at someone\u2019s wedding about them. What a turkey.", "NTA - but please prove him wrong. Tell him you\u2019re not going to marry him for money and that in fact you aren\u2019t going to marry him at all and just walk away. If after three years together he thinks you\u2019re a gold digger he clearly doesn\u2019t love you and has issues. You need to leave him.", "NTA. Honestly, if he claims \u201che doesn\u2019t know if he wants to marry you\u201d, after 3 years dating, that\u2019s a huge lie. He well knows that he doesn\u2019t want to marry you and the equivalent salary in the relationship is a dealbreaker. Maybe it\u2019s time for an honest discussion with the reality of your relationship moving forward. You deserve to get your happy ending, it just might not be with this guy.", "NTA and I find it really disturbing that he refers to his mother as a \u201cgold digger\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou said it, you did nothing wrong, it wasn't planned.\n\nIf the marriage thing is coming up everyday then I can see why he blew up. If it's not then I think it was inappropriate, he may have just felt uncomfortable because some blokes don't understand how much some women share with each other. It sounds like you share everything with your best friend which is okay but that can make guys very uncomfortable which is what it sounds like has happened with your fella.\n\nIf I was to guess, your boyfriend's father has rubbed some opinions off onto him. If finance was not an issue before why is it now? Some people are just taking what little info you have given and giving drastic responses but this is for you to justify. Also is he just making so much more because he is in a silver spoon position to skyrocket to the top of the fathers company? If so he may be very out of touch and not understand what it's actually like.\n\nYou need to make a decision, it doesn't sound like he will ask until you work you way up and make more money, to me that is very shallow but again, you have 3 years together and I have 200-500 words to go off.\n\nThat being said, when people show you who they really are you need to trust that, go by actions not by words. What will happen if you have kids? I think he is very money focussed and probably always will be - does that work for you...being less important to him than the money he brings in?\n\nEDIT: I think I misread a lot. Father loves you, BF called you a gold digger...oh dear, my dear. I can now see why some people's opinions are so strong. I think this is something you really need to think about and decide what you well and truly want.", "Girl, leave. He thinks you are in it for the money. This will never be a partnership. He needs therapy and you need to move on to a partner that believes and appreciates you.", "NTA because it wasn't planned or anything but this is a sensitive topic for both of you and youre colliding on how your future could look. He has deep fears and your desires to be married and how it looks aren't aligning. It is insensitive to tell someone to go to therapy, even if it's clear support could be beneficial for them because it kind of implies he needs to \"fix\" something when that's not the case here.", "Seriously, dump this guy. He thinks you\u2019re not good enough to marry him.\nWhat you should be looking for is a guy who feels lucky you\u2019re willing to marry him.", "NTA, obviously", "Sis I read up to end of the first paragraph and deffo not AHole , it clearly seems he has commitment issues and would deffo benefit from therapy - and if he keeps blowing up and not discuss it like a mature man then sis tell em boy bye - you shouldn\u2019t have to wait for him to ask you and insult you about your income like that", "Boyfriend likes when OP has less money than him but doesn\u2019t want a goldigger girlfriend?  Anyone else confused?\n\nOP NTA. Catching the bouquet is just a harmless action that in no way results in marriage (just an old wives tale)", "NTA - but your bf is a dumbass, so I suggest you dodge this canon and save yourself some love.", "NTA, you\u2019ve been dating for 3 years and he should know that catching a bouquet doesn\u2019t actually mean you\u2019ll be getting married or pressuring someone. Like, you were simply participating in a game. \n\nHonestly dump him, he legit called you a gold digger.", "NTA, red flag that he blew up about this and is suggesting you planned it intentionally to pressure him, shows that he does in fact seem quite paranoid about commitment  \n\n\nAlso the gold digger thing, why are you still with him? Is he ever gonna come around to marry you? Seems unlikely", "NTA for catching the bouquet, but you\u2019re definitely being an AH to yourself.\n\nHe\u2019s already told you he doesn\u2019t want to marry you. He also told you it\u2019s because he thinks you are a gold digger.\n\nYou need to process this and accept that he has told you the truth. Therapy will not suddenly make him think of you differently. He just sees you as a \u201cright now\u201d girlfriend but will absolutely dump you once he finds someone he actually considers wife material/a better fit.\n\nLeave if you have any respect for yourself.", "NTA and this guy is a dick please don't try to force it with him. He said he doesn't want to marry you take him at his word. \n\nAlso side note- he went to your best friend and told them he didn't want to marry you then got mad that she had a response that was \"meddling\" and doesn't want you to talk to her about it?

You think he\u2019ll be any better to you???", "NTA but I think this says everything you need to know about him.

I think people might be missing the line \u201cI was getting a little sad that my boyfriend didn\u2019t let it convince him that marriage is a good idea.\u201d\n\nWTF?", "ESH\n\nNot a fan of his basically calling you a gold digger or,in fact, for dating you at all if it's important to him to be on equal financial  footing with his partner.

As far as I know the catching of the bouquet is supposed 5o be fun and lighthearted, not a marriage contract. However, I can kind of see how this may have come across to him, given the circumstances.\n\nIt seems he's made it very clear that, at the very least, marriage is not in the cards right now and that he's very wary of marriage. Dispite that, marriage keeps being brought up, therapy is suggested, friends are involved, his dad has your back, etc. That's a lot of people not in this relationship having stong opinions on this relationship. It seems constant. With that in mind, I can somewhat see how he would react to your catching of the bouquet and his misinterpretation of it as people just wont leave him alone about asking you to marry him.\n\nTake the hint instead of pressuring him into submission. You all clearly want different  things. You've got his dad on your side, friends on your side, reddit on your side, but this dude clearly doesn't want marriage right now (or possibly ever). You have every justification to end the relationship, so do that instead of beating a dead horse into goo like you're currently doing", "ESH\n\nOk, so firstly, why are you an AH?...\nI'm afraid it doesn't sound like he's ready for marriage- for whatever reason - the gold digger stuff could be an excuse to get you to back off a bit? It does sound like you are pressuring him and certainly bringing other people into it as well. That is not cool and will not make either of you happy. You already told your friend about your issues. I get you need someone to talk to, but you are bringing her opinion to your boyfriend and allowing her to pressure him as well. Of course catching the bouquet was fine, but by that point your boyfriend already felt pressured and was projecting. \n\n> his dad was very wary of me but we have a very good relationship right now and even he says his son is being ridiculous\n\nSo you have been canvassing other people's opinion and getting them to pressure your bf too? It doesn't seem to stop at your best friend. \n\nSo why is he an AH.\nFirstly...he's saying you could be a gold digger. He doesn't trust you yet and/or he has a warped opinion of certain women and fear of them because of his mother. Plus, he did overreact to the bouquet toss. He does need to work out his trust issues and stop implying you are a gold digger because that is very disrespectful. \n\nBoth of you need pre-marriage counselling. Both of you need therapy. You because you need to have more self worth than pressuring a man to marry you who is disrespecting you. Him for his mummy issues etc. \n\nNeither of you are ready for marriage. Also, if you want to show him that you want to marry him for him, offer a pre-nup (careful not to get screwed though, and get your own lawer). \n\nGood luck", "Yta for telling your friend about that i doubt he even trusts you anymore i wouldnt .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The problem is that lately we have been discussing marriage and my boyfriend says he is hesitant to marry a woman who makes so much less than him. He says this is because he grew up with a gold digger mother and doesn't want to repeat his father's mistakes.

I would like to apologize for Covid and the other plagues that happened as a result of my childhood naivety.", "Which is completely fine.", "I agree, but telling him he had commitment issues and that he needs to see a therapist is wrong, and he isn't wrong about bringing the best friend into private matters. That wasn't necessary", "Right? I work part time at a public library and my husband is an IT consultant. He makes like 40x what I do. He would be okay if I wanted to just quit and volunteer if that\u2019s what made me happy. Because\u2026we love each other and we aren\u2019t with each other for how much the other makes. He has been unhappy in his job and I\u2019ve been trying to convince him to quit actually. We both just want each other to be happy. That\u2019s what marriage should be about - love, happiness, and growth together.", "NTA.  He does not want you to leave him, but he is not planning to marry you.  The  kicker is if you break up he will find someone else pretty quickly.\n\nYou are allowing an intimate relationship with a man who has told you that you are not enough.  That is going to be bumpy.", "Amen. Just came to say this. Sis this man does not want to marry you.\n\nYou are his 'good time' not 'life time' person. He does not deserve you and you deserve better.", "He is NOT stringing her along. HE was TRANSPARENT and HONEST about not wanting to marry her.", "[removed]", "There doesn't need to be any counseling she needs to leave. He doesn't want to marry her. If he does go through with it, it will be a \"shut up ring.\"", "\"You both need to go to pre-marriage counseling\" .. Ther is no need to o that, because there WILL BE NO MARRIAGE. And she knpws that, because he has TOLD HER.", "He HAS made up his mind: He DOES NOT WANT to marry her. And he has been honest about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is NO carrot, no stick, just the truth: He enjoys the relationship, but e doies not want to marry her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: he is NOT doing anything wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHE is the AH for pressuring him instead of accepting his decission.", "exactly, came to say this. he must be immensely insecure about himself to be acting like this. i would\u2019ve packed my bags after that one. you\u2019re NTA op, but him on the other hand\u2026", "My 2\u00a2 is that he simply doesn't want to marry her and she should leave. Couples counseling with a boyfriend who clearly won't even commit is absurd. She needs to let it go.", "In the post she implies she intended for the wedding to sway her BFs views. He obviously picked up on something real other than the bouquet.", "Yup. He may not be ready to be married soon but after three years he should have a good idea of if he wants to marry his partner. He clearly does not.", "Huh? Of course she would be a little bit sad, she wants to get married. So in your opinion it's perfectly ok for him to be angry and cause an argument because she caught a bouquet but not for her to be a little sad that he doesn't want to marry her. Catching a bouquet is just a wedding tradition and she herself said that it didn't mean anything. Little kids catch bouquets all time, does that mean they are getting married, or that anyone is pressuring them to get married? I think your shock is better saved for when him not wanting to marry a girl with a lower income than him because he's afraid they are a 'gold digger'.", "It's offensive to suggest a person needs theraphy for not wanting to get married. Most people in my country (Italy) never get married anymore.", "Why wouldn't she tell her best friend? That's literally what your friends are for", "Then is he equally wrong about telling his friends? Because he did. \nHe said his friends agreed she shouldn\u2019t have caught it or even participated. \nSo it sounds like his friends are aware of the situation. \nPeople are allowed to talk about their relationships with their friends.", "You don't talk to your best friends about your life?", "How is she TA?", "Why do you care? Let people enjoy things lol.", "At my mom's wedding, they switched it so the girls caught the garter and the guys caught the bouquet... then the girl put the garter on the guy... it was hysterical", "At that point, I wouldn't be surprised if he were a fan of Andrew Tate.", "If his mom was a gold digger, that\u2019s not a red flag. The red flag is calling his GF a gold digger AND refusing to see a therapist. It\u2019s ok to have a gold digging mother, you don\u2019t choose your mother - it\u2019s not ok to assume all women are gold diggers and that\u2019s the vibe he\u2019s putting off.", ">We did not plan this, I just happened to be in the right place and I don't really believe in the bouquet superstition anyway\n\nErr.... where does it say it was a scheme?", "Found OP\u2019s boyfriend.", "What a strange way to say you didn\u2019t understand the post.", "OP said the boyfriend made the argument that he thought it was a scheme. if it truly was a scheme the bride would have rigged it by handing it to OP instead of tossing it.", "Where does it say that? She said he thought it was a scheme and she said they didn't plan it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Even if that were true (its not), her bf still needs therapy and is the AH in this situation and she should still leave.

Reading comprehension for one.", "Found the OP\u2019s boyfriend . The world revolves around the rich boyfriend obviously. The OP\u2019s friend planned a wedding, invited the OP and her boyfriend, made sure the OP caught the boquete .

She needs to acknowledge these red flags and consider if he\u2019s even husband material to begin with.", "Yes. Exactly. I get that as a wealthy person you would be wary of potential gold diggers, but if your are still suspicious of your partner after being together for years, then there is something wrong with you and/or with the relationship.", "Especially when talking about his own mother.", "It\u2019s quite a claim to say she\u2019s even leeching off of him at all\u2026.calling someone who makes less money than their partner a gold digger or leech is ludicrous.", "Yeah I really miss the good old days when men could marry women, force them to give up their entire life and career to raise their kids, then divorce them for a younger woman and leave them without a penny as they try to re-enter the job market after not working for 20 years. So much more FAIR.", "Cool. Tell that to my friend who pays alimony to her ex husband. Pre-nups are a thing if he\u2019s concerned about their differing finances.", "The simple solution is a prenup.", "Oh, is that why it happened?

I get it. You\u2019re just like OP\u2019s boyfriend. Have the day you deserve.", "She said in her own words that she was sad that the wedding didn\u2019t convince the BF that marriage was a good idea.
