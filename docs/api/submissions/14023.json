She decided she wanted them herself and even found a lady in our area who can do the style for her. \n\nWhen she brought it up to me and my husband I thought the idea was perfect! I ensured she knew what she getting herself into and that more than likely, if she ever wanted them out she may need to shave her head. She said she understood that and would just wear wigs or rock the bald look for awhile. \n\nHowever, my husband completely disagrees. He thinks she\u2019s too young to make this decision.

However, I think he\u2019s overreacting to this one. It\u2019s true that some hairstyles are more stereotyped than others, but that is the fault of others and not of our daughter.

You've advised you daughter that she'll have to cut all of her hair off if she ever decides to get rid of the locs. She's fine with that so there's no problem. Your husbands reasons for being against this are problematic.

Technically, it is not permanent. Yes,she would have to shave her head but her hair would grow back. \n2. Body autonomy.

That's part of her culture and if she wants to do it, she can. Period. \n\nYour daughter knows the repercussions if she decides she doesn't like them. Your husband is literally echoing the very thing he claims to hate. He's teaching your daughter to present herself as \"less black\" (having white or white adjacent hair styles)  as to not be seen as unprofessional. That's unacceptable. She's half black. If he didn't want his daughter wearing traditionally black hairstyles, he shouldn't have married a black woman. I don't think he's trying to be problematic but he is. \n\nNow is the PERFECT time for her to go through trial and error on what she likes. She has parents to remind her she's beautiful if it doesn't work out and she takes a self esteem hit based on others reactions, a routine to help her learn time management as far as hair care goes in different styles, and she's already trying to learn who she is as a person. If you suffocate what she wants with what you want when it comes to her style, she will have a much harder time figuring out who she is when she moves out. (speaking from personal experience here) \n\nIt's her hair. That's really what all this boils down to. Your daughter is not your husbands property. She's her own person. Within logical rules of safety and boundaries, her body, hair and style are all things that belong to her. She should be allowed to do what she wants with her own body and hair (within reason of course) hair grows back. Getting a locs as 13 is not the same as getting a teardrop tattoo on your cheek. There's a very VERY good chance shell decide on a different hairstyle long before a career is even in the picture. That's even besides the fact that black hairstyles arent unprofessional. \n\nPeople living  by the fear of those stereotypes are what keeps those stereotypes around. If everyone is afraid to lock up their hair because they may be seen as unprofessional, who's going to prove people wrong? Who's going to change that idea? No one. So the stereotype will stick around. \n\n\nPS my husband has locs. He's a lead at an IT security company for law firms all over the world. Name any law firm and he provides their IT security, I can just about guarantee it.  He makes well into 6 figures and is very very successful in his career. IT companies are always trying to poach him from his current company, even with the locs.  We're 24 and we're about to buy a house. Our life is good. Guess what. His locs didn't stop that.

Honestly if my mom had let me cut my hair at 8 when I first started asking for short hair instead of insisting I'd look like a boy and pressuring me to keep being her dress up doll, I don't think I would've felt pushed into spending my teen years looking like I lost a fight with a weed trimmer then fell in a vat of fluorescent dye, nor do I think I would have gotten as many piercings.\n\nLike, no regrets - I had fun with it - and I wasn't naturally a super extreme kid so I probably would've been satisfied with a pompadour or something instead of going whole hog into, \"what will most piss off my mom for my next haircut and outfit?\" Cuz like, most teens don't have that as a major motivation for their behaviour but for me once I claimed my agency over my appearance, I rubbed her nose in it for a solid 5 years. \n\nAnd I eventually ended up getting the same haircut I'd wanted at 8, loved it, and wore it for a solid decade.

The idea behind them is as beautiful as the end result. I think your husband needs a little learning too. As an old straight white woman, he\u2019s wrong. Not only does she not need to be worried about the professional world at 13, she doesn\u2019t need to full stop. There was a time not so long ago that tattoos were taboo in professional settings. Wild colors on the hair was as well. I lived outside the US for 16 years and have just entered the American workplace. It\u2019s a different world now, thank goodness! If I\u2019m giving your hubby the benefit of the doubt, I wonder if it\u2019s an ick factor because of the different washing needs. All I ever knew about dreadlocks for a really long time was that they didn\u2019t get washed. With my sad little greasy hair, I had a huge ick factor. Then I had a woman we hired (in an incredibly well paid and senior consulting position at a company know for its staid nature and blue suits with red ties, mind you) who had gorgeous dreadlocks and a willingness to entertain my dumb questions. When she explained the process she went through\u2026 I was amazed and impressed with the dedication it took. And it removed all thought of ick. She washed her hair appropriately to her hair type and needs, of course. And my bias was honestly mere ignorance of the truth. Since then I\u2019m full of admiration for people with intricate hairstyles. I am the laziest person in the world with hair. Also, as a parent who married someone with a different ethnic background and had one kid with crazy curly hair, I realized when she was like 5 that I can\u2019t help her. It\u2019s an area where I feel like a failure because I was never able to give her tips or buy the right products. When you don\u2019t have the experience, it\u2019s time to sit down and hush. So you are absolutely NTA. Having said that, since you are in a relationship with your husband, it probably would be good to help him see the light. This isn\u2019t the last time he will have to face his strong, competent, capable daughter having her own mind on things (great job, mom!). Tightly controlling her will result in him not continuing a relationship. My son let his hair grow out rather long. He then dyed it the color of Cookie Monster. He didn\u2019t tell hubby and I because he was worried about hubby\u2019s reaction. While I was helping my curly girl dye her hair purple, she let it slip. I made up an excuse to get him to Zoom with me so that I could tell him how great it was. Hubby was not pleased but I have MONTHS to help him through his need for time to adjust. He\u2019s one of the NOOO! kind of people when first presented with big change. Then he works himself through it. I\u2019m not sure if your husband has some of that going on, but I find that helping him get through his own issues helps. It\u2019s not your job, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I choose to do it because I love my hubby and he loves his kids with all his heart, so I want him to continue to grow in relationship with them.", "NTA .
