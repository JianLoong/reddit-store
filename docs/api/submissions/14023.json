She decided she wanted them herself and even found a lady in our area who can do the style for her. \n\nWhen she brought it up to me and my husband I thought the idea was perfect! I ensured she knew what she getting herself into and that more than likely, if she ever wanted them out she may need to shave her head. She said she understood that and would just wear wigs or rock the bald look for awhile. \n\nHowever, my husband completely disagrees. He thinks she\u2019s too young to make this decision.

However, I think he\u2019s overreacting to this one. It\u2019s true that some hairstyles are more stereotyped than others, but that is the fault of others and not of our daughter.

You've advised you daughter that she'll have to cut all of her hair off if she ever decides to get rid of the locs. She's fine with that so there's no problem. Your husbands reasons for being against this are problematic.

Technically, it is not permanent. Yes,she would have to shave her head but her hair would grow back. \n2. Body autonomy.

That's part of her culture and if she wants to do it, she can. Period. \n\nYour daughter knows the repercussions if she decides she doesn't like them. Your husband is literally echoing the very thing he claims to hate. He's teaching your daughter to present herself as \"less black\" (having white or white adjacent hair styles)  as to not be seen as unprofessional. That's unacceptable. She's half black. If he didn't want his daughter wearing traditionally black hairstyles, he shouldn't have married a black woman. I don't think he's trying to be problematic but he is. \n\nNow is the PERFECT time for her to go through trial and error on what she likes. She has parents to remind her she's beautiful if it doesn't work out and she takes a self esteem hit based on others reactions, a routine to help her learn time management as far as hair care goes in different styles, and she's already trying to learn who she is as a person. If you suffocate what she wants with what you want when it comes to her style, she will have a much harder time figuring out who she is when she moves out. (speaking from personal experience here) \n\nIt's her hair. That's really what all this boils down to. Your daughter is not your husbands property. She's her own person. Within logical rules of safety and boundaries, her body, hair and style are all things that belong to her. She should be allowed to do what she wants with her own body and hair (within reason of course) hair grows back. Getting a locs as 13 is not the same as getting a teardrop tattoo on your cheek. There's a very VERY good chance shell decide on a different hairstyle long before a career is even in the picture. That's even besides the fact that black hairstyles arent unprofessional. \n\nPeople living  by the fear of those stereotypes are what keeps those stereotypes around. If everyone is afraid to lock up their hair because they may be seen as unprofessional, who's going to prove people wrong? Who's going to change that idea? No one. So the stereotype will stick around. \n\n\nPS my husband has locs. He's a lead at an IT security company for law firms all over the world. Name any law firm and he provides their IT security, I can just about guarantee it.  He makes well into 6 figures and is very very successful in his career. IT companies are always trying to poach him from his current company, even with the locs.  We're 24 and we're about to buy a house. Our life is good. Guess what. His locs didn't stop that.

I can only speak to a white womans experience so please tell me to sit down if needed and I apologize if this isn\u2019t a good comparison. \n\nMy 13 year old daughter wanted to shave her head. I personally did the same thing so can relate to the desire and also the awful experience of growing it out, especially all the mean kids etc. HOWEVER, it\u2019s her choice, and it\u2019s actually a decent way to teach kids that age about how those things are (semi) permanent and the consequences that go with choices like this, with no real repercussions other than a few months of a weird ass haircut as it grows, and being able to laugh at pictures from that time as you get older. She\u2019s currently in the awkward grown-out phase now (but it was/is adorable).  \nI know this is a different experience and desire but maybe your husband could relate more to something like that. What if your daughter just wanted to shave her head to make hair maintenance easier? It\u2019s hair, it grows. We\u2019ve all made hair decisions we didn\u2019t love, and hopefully lots of hair decisions we did love. I think this actually sounds like a lovely option for your daughter, and I\u2019m all for making any kind of hair care easier or better for the self confidence.", "Agreed! The biggest lesson my mom learned when I was exploring my self-presentation is that hair grows back. She didn\u2019t want me to get my hair cut short, she didn\u2019t want me to dye it fun colors\u2026 but then she realized that it\u2019s just hair, it\u2019s not permanent, and if I change my mind, it\u2019ll grow back. I haven\u2019t really ever changed my mind, though! I\u2019ve spent the better part of a decade with short blue hair, and I\u2019ve loved it!! Hair with tight coils takes a lot longer to grow back since the coiling/shrinkage makes it seem a lot shorter than it actually is, but even still, it WILL grow back, even if it might take a while.", "This, and 13 is a good age for this sort of experimentation anyway. Educational institutions tend to be a bit more forgiving image-wise and she has no career to put on the line yet.\n\nIt\u2019s such a non-permanent decision too, in that she can choose to shave and wear wigs for a while if she ever regretted the locs.", "I'm biracial and my (white) mom didn't stop being possessive of my hair until I was in my early 20s. Any time she'd concede, she'd go out of her way to sabotage the cut / dye / style to prove that I was wrong for going against her wishes of me having hair down to my ass. I eventually started doing things behind her back and dealing with the meltdown later because her crying over a bag of hair was easier to deal with than being cornered and having her scream (that I'll look like a homophobic slur) if I cut my hair.\n\nAll her controlling and possessive behavior did was put another huge wedge in an already strained relationship and I feel like OP's husband will end up walking a similar path if he continues to expect his daughter to fit into a narrow western view of acceptable beauty standards.", "NTA, this is what I wanted to say too.", "No, no.
