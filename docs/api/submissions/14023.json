I ensured she knew what she getting herself into and that more than likely, if she ever wanted them out she may need to shave her head. She said she understood that and would just wear wigs or rock the bald look for awhile. \n\nHowever, my husband completely disagrees. He thinks she\u2019s too young to make this decision.

However, I think he\u2019s overreacting to this one. It\u2019s true that some hairstyles are more stereotyped than others, but that is the fault of others and not of our daughter.

You've advised you daughter that she'll have to cut all of her hair off if she ever decides to get rid of the locs. She's fine with that so there's no problem. Your husbands reasons for being against this are problematic.

Technically, it is not permanent. Yes,she would have to shave her head but her hair would grow back. \n2. Body autonomy.

That's part of her culture and if she wants to do it, she can. Period. \n\nYour daughter knows the repercussions if she decides she doesn't like them. Your husband is literally echoing the very thing he claims to hate. He's teaching your daughter to present herself as \"less black\" (having white or white adjacent hair styles)  as to not be seen as unprofessional. That's unacceptable. She's half black. If he didn't want his daughter wearing traditionally black hairstyles, he shouldn't have married a black woman. I don't think he's trying to be problematic but he is. \n\nNow is the PERFECT time for her to go through trial and error on what she likes. She has parents to remind her she's beautiful if it doesn't work out and she takes a self esteem hit based on others reactions, a routine to help her learn time management as far as hair care goes in different styles, and she's already trying to learn who she is as a person. If you suffocate what she wants with what you want when it comes to her style, she will have a much harder time figuring out who she is when she moves out. (speaking from personal experience here) \n\nIt's her hair. That's really what all this boils down to. Your daughter is not your husbands property. She's her own person. Within logical rules of safety and boundaries, her body, hair and style are all things that belong to her. She should be allowed to do what she wants with her own body and hair (within reason of course) hair grows back. Getting a locs as 13 is not the same as getting a teardrop tattoo on your cheek. There's a very VERY good chance shell decide on a different hairstyle long before a career is even in the picture. That's even besides the fact that black hairstyles arent unprofessional. \n\nPeople living  by the fear of those stereotypes are what keeps those stereotypes around. If everyone is afraid to lock up their hair because they may be seen as unprofessional, who's going to prove people wrong? Who's going to change that idea? No one. So the stereotype will stick around. \n\n\nPS my husband has locs. He's a lead at an IT security company for law firms all over the world. Name any law firm and he provides their IT security, I can just about guarantee it.  He makes well into 6 figures and is very very successful in his career. IT companies are always trying to poach him from his current company, even with the locs.  We're 24 and we're about to buy a house. Our life is good. Guess what. His locs didn't stop that.

A 5 year old who might want a certain hair style/hair colour/piercing/etc but can't understand the amount of effort to care for it is one thing, but a 13 year old should be trusted with that responsibility (or the consequences if they don't).", "Ah yes, the way to end racial issues is to muffle the cause! Certain hairstyles will \u201cnot allow success due to stereotypes\u201d so we should stop styling hair! That is the obvious way to go, because the issue isn\u2019t the racist stereotypes, it\u2019s the hairstyle! \n\n\nThis thought process always irks me!! Stereotypes won\u2019t change if you always follow them, and most stereotypes shouldn\u2019t be followed, especially when it\u2019s something so racist.", "This. He is feels high on his wokeness by proxy. He may say he means well and is aware of biases etc but he is still policing his black daughter with racists ideas he has never suffered from.\nHe gives \"I'm a good one\".", "Yes, it's not a facial tattoo \ud83d\ude2d", "Try not to be so quick to scream \u201cracist\u201d. He might just be a realist who actually cares for this girl. It\u2019s a fact that people with locks are treated differently, whether we like it or not. It\u2019s been [ruled](http://www.essence.com/news/judge-ban-dreadlocks-workplace-discrimination/) in court that banning dreadlocks from workplaces isn\u2019t discriminatory. I think it\u2019s fair to prepare the girl for real world. If it was my child I would absolutely let her wear her hair the way she wants, but I would also talk to her about the social consequences in a prejudiced world.", "On a side note maybe braids/cornrows whatever you may call them are a less permanent solution but if done correctly they can last months and look similar to locs??", "I partially agree with you, but it sounds like husband's only issue here is the (semi) permanent-ness of it. OP does say that her daughter has done other braids and stuff. \n\nI give a soft AH to the husband without further context of if he has issues with other styles, but OP is still right.  It's hair!  play with it! It grows back!", "That was my thinking! If he wants the daughters chances of success to be maximized, he DEFINITELY wants her to experiment with her look in an environment where it doesn\u2019t really matter, rather than when she\u2019s in her 20\u2019s and trying to be professional. The only thing I\u2019ll say (as a non-black, non-woman) is that stereotypes and unconscious bias are a thing, and both parents should keep their eye out for it when daughter does sport hairstyles that may be seen as less \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201cmainstream\u201d. Don\u2019t want the teachers or coaches or whatnot reducing expectations or having her miss out on some math Olympiad or chess club or whatever because of a perceived \u201ctype\u201d.  But that\u2019s part of parenting\u2014 protecting the kid as they\u2019re learning who they are.", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA", "What\u2019s a \u201cstreet hairstyle\u201d?", "I was afraid the husband would get angry by being reminded that they went against what he said, not so much the locs themselves.", "Not all countries are US.\n\nFor where I am from that attitude would be racist AF", "My mom had a mild fit when I was in my teens when I (a semi-goth) had my hair dyed black with green skunk stripes. \n\nBut all she did was tell me if I ever came home with one of those wallets with a front pocket to back pocket chain, I was done. \n\nI don\u2019t know why that was her breaking point lol. \n\nFWIW, I\u2019m 42 now and my hair is bright pink and I still work a professional job.", "may i refer the husband to an old episode of Sabrina the Teenage Witch? to quote, \"Hair grows! Hair grows.\"", "1) as a teacher with purple hair, shhh. My purple hair has never stopped me from getting a job. \n2) you ever seen locs? They\u2019re GORGEOUS. They\u2019re a beautiful and maintenance friendly style for black hair and other people\u2019s racism is not a reason not to do it if it\u2019s not genuinely dangerous. \n3) a tattoo *is* permanent. This is just hair. It\u2019ll grow back if she decides she wants a change."]}
