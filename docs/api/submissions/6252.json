We both had our own homes and he had some inheritance money so I had no problem with this. It's always been 50/50 and we have one joint account that we transfer into for our monthly bills and kid (5&2) expenses like lessons and sports.\n\nMy job has gotten more and more flexible about WFH over the years to the point that I no longer need to go into the office. If the kids are sick, they stay home with me while I work. I don't get sick days and husband has 5 per year. Things at work changed for me in the last 3 months (corporate restructuring) and I have HATED the job I have been in. It's made me dread having to work and has been very stressful.\n\nDuring the month of December, I WFH alone only a handful of times. I either had one or both kids at home sick at any given time. I was still taking calls and having to be on video for important calls and it was exhausting.\n\nA new opportunity came up at work, one that I was very excited about and something that would be good for my career. The one catch is that I would have to go into the office one day a month.\n\nGoing to the office is a 1.5 hour train ride each way, which means I would leave before the kids got up and wouldn't come home until dinner. On every other day, I would still wake up with them, get them ready for the day and drop them off at daycare and school by 8:30, head to my home office, then pick them up from daycare and after school care at around 4:30. \n\nMy husband has a job that isn't flexible. He earns roughly half what I do. On the days that I would go into the office on that one day a month, he has asked that his monthly expenses be scaled back to make up for the day off without pay he would have to take to be able to drop off and pick up the kids (he normally leaves around 6:45 and is home by 5, so earlier and later than needed for kid pick ups).\n\nI don't think I should have to essentially pay my husband to have a day off to be a parent. I don't get compensation for making all the meals, buying groceries for the kids or doing the daytime chauffeuring. Is the time that I spend doing everything every other day not enough to say that he should take the hit for one day of having to be a parent? Since we decided from the beginning that our finances would be separate and expenses 50/50, why now does he get a day off with pay at my expense because he has a job that pays less?

And you haven't listed anything your husband does to balance that out. Him getting the kids ready and driving them to and from daycare one day a month is a drop in the bucket compared to what you do. Him taking that day off is a reasonable sacrifice because your career progression and subsequent pay raises will benefit your family (e.g. being able to put more money into college funds); married couples are supposed to be a team.\n\nLots of people are getting on your ass about the 50/50 split in finances while you earn more but I don't see the issue with that seeing as it's something you and your husband have agreed on and it was his idea when he had more money. It could be something to revisit but you haven't mentioned your husband having a problem with the split overall, just that he wants the added stipulation of being payed for the day off every month. You also stated in your comments that he has more savings than you and has money left over after bills for an expensive hobby so it doesn't seem that working a day less every month will have any significant impact on him financially.", "YTA. You are married and you make double and he has to pay 50%. He is contributing far more of \"his\" resources to the family than you are. \n\nHe's definitely right.", "For what it\u2019s worth, I think she only needs to pay 1/2 his salary. Because this is the cost of him doing it instead of a baby sitter or nanny, which they would have otherwise split, she only needs to split half his \u201crate\u201d to parent.", "[50/50 was HIS idea from when *he had more money* than her when they first met.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100vqy8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_husband_to_be_a/j2kq7n9/)", "If he wants more move up, find anew job, learn, expand", "[deleted]", "Yeah, the difference is he'd actually have the day off and be just doing the childcare unlike her who has to do double time and be working both jobs. Just because she's been managing to multi task doesn't mean you should minimize how incredibly hard that work load is.", "Hire a babysitter.", "This is why having one parent take care of the home and not work is important.", "So 50/50 is okay if the circumstances are *he* has more money, but not if *she* has more money?", "Not exactly. If he was an average parent who didn\u2019t have childcare for one day a month, he would have to just eat the day and take it off, right? \n\nBilling the other parent for what is still also your own responsibility is weird, imo. (But so is total 50/50 with no income disparity considerations.) \n\nMaybe NAH but you guys need to work together to find a better solution, one that is mutually beneficial.", "That's a separate issue and hard to quantify. Op should be paying more because they make more and OPs husband should be helping around the house.", "So what?  There was another post here recently about a woman who didn\u2019t pay for her wife to vacation with her because wife couldn\u2019t afford it and they split things 50/50 even though the poster made 3x as much.  Their decision to split 50/50 was also made early on by both people.  She was absolutely attacked for not paying for her wife and for making her wife pay 50% of rent, etc..  Times change, incomes change, decisions should change.", "Do you realize how sexist this would sound if the wife was the one making less money?  WTF.", "You are asking him to take a pay cut so that you can get a raise.  You can see that\u2019s unfair, right?", "Calculate his hourly salary and pay him for the hours needed, then ask him to find a part time job for the rest. NTA", "These are rules he made up himself when he had more money than op due to inheritance. Now the tables have turned he doesn't like it", "She\u2019s doing double while still earning income. He would lose be losing income if he had to take off one day a month to take care of the kids. This isn\u2019t about parenting. This is about finances. OP wants her husband to lose some of his income and still pay the same amount towards their expenses.", "THANK YOU! All these people giving examples of situations changing (like health issues causing loss of income/employment) are overlooking the fact that the ONLY thing that has changed is one day a month of extra responsibilities and now OP makes more. So it\u2019s fine that she was still paying 50% AT HIS REQUEST and having less disposable income despite also holding down the household, but now that it\u2019s her making more suddenly she\u2019s an AH? Nope. \n\nETA: Especially when OP has stated it\u2019s literally only 2.5 hours that need to be covered in the morning! Husband is MILKING IT.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t understand separate finances in a marriage. Seems like a recipe for disaster, especially with larger differences in income, but the line was clearly drawn to benefit one person over the other in the first place. Why is it up to only OP to compromise? NTA!", "Who said anything about that?", "Not that hard to quantify.  Look up how much it would cost to hire someone to do all these things.", "My point is that a ton of people in the comments are ripping into her for saying 50/50 because she makes more than him without the context that he was *completely fine with it* when he had more money than her (it was, in fact, his idea). So he's okay with an even split when it benefits him financially, he's okay with a financial split so long as she's taking on the brunt of the home/childcare labor while they're both working, it's just literally any change that puts any burden on him that's a problem?", "When they started their 50/50 arrangement he did make more money and he was the one that asked for the deal...", "Did OP say he made the rules himself? I didn't see that. Assuming that's true, situations change. If OP loses her job suddenly would we still expect them to pay 50/50? I wouldn't  expect that. \n\nGoing 50/50 is not something that should be decided once and never changed ever again. OPs partner is choosing not to change the 50/50 in hard dollars but is asking for what seems like a  reasonable accommodation due to situational changes.\n\nHeck the courts adjust child support when ppl have tangible increases or decreases in financial situations. This is no different.", "This sounds less like a marriage and more like a cold partnership. Why are you guys together if you don\u2019t even love each other enough to make compromises for each other?", "Wouldn\u2019t he also have to leave work early to get the kids from daycare?  You said 6:45 is too late.", "I just find it odd she's getting so much grief for it in the comments when he was seemingly okay with the situation when it benefited him, but now it needs to shift since he's no longer benefiting.", "Yea do that in a relationship, have the conversation on who is doing more, that always ends well /s. For real though, OP should be paying her fair share and that's by percentage of household income and OPs husband should be carrying his weight around the house.", "But he didn\u2019t actually have more, it was in savings/retirement stuff.  They were probably EARNING the same and that\u2019s what they paid bills from.  He\u2019s probably been okay with it because he still had enough \u201cmad money\u201d do do what he wanted, but of course he\u2019s not going to be okay with losing part of his income so that his wife can make MORE.  That would make absolutely no sense.", "I don\u2019t think he was making more money, he just had more in his retirement savings.", "[Yes, in comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100vqy8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_husband_to_be_a/j2kq7n9/)\n\n>50/50 and separate accounts was his idea because he had a lot more money than I did when we first met.", "Just to clarify for you, he gets 5 paid days off hence why they are discussing the other days he'd be taking off as unpaid ones.", "I don't see anywhere where it says it did benefit him. At best when they started they both had their own homes and he had inheritance, but it doesn't say he was making more than her.", "It really is a convo that should be had so that all of the housework and childcare doesn't fall to one person.  As far as how they decide to split finances, that is their business.  The goal of my comment was to say that housework and child care can absolutely be quantified....and it isn't cheap.", "No, he has more savings now but was making more when they made the arrangement", "That\u2019s not how I read it.  She said he \u201chad more\u201d and still \u201chas more\u201d in savings.  Either way, it\u2019s her asking him to take a pay cut so that she can get a raise.  How about they find a high school kid to babysit 1 morning a month?  I do not believe that they don\u2019t have a local FaceBook page where they could ask for help."]}
