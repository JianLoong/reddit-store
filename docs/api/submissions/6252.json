We both had our own homes and he had some inheritance money so I had no problem with this. It's always been 50/50 and we have one joint account that we transfer into for our monthly bills and kid (5&2) expenses like lessons and sports.\n\nMy job has gotten more and more flexible about WFH over the years to the point that I no longer need to go into the office. If the kids are sick, they stay home with me while I work. I don't get sick days and husband has 5 per year. Things at work changed for me in the last 3 months (corporate restructuring) and I have HATED the job I have been in. It's made me dread having to work and has been very stressful.\n\nDuring the month of December, I WFH alone only a handful of times. I either had one or both kids at home sick at any given time. I was still taking calls and having to be on video for important calls and it was exhausting.\n\nA new opportunity came up at work, one that I was very excited about and something that would be good for my career. The one catch is that I would have to go into the office one day a month.\n\nGoing to the office is a 1.5 hour train ride each way, which means I would leave before the kids got up and wouldn't come home until dinner. On every other day, I would still wake up with them, get them ready for the day and drop them off at daycare and school by 8:30, head to my home office, then pick them up from daycare and after school care at around 4:30. \n\nMy husband has a job that isn't flexible. He earns roughly half what I do. On the days that I would go into the office on that one day a month, he has asked that his monthly expenses be scaled back to make up for the day off without pay he would have to take to be able to drop off and pick up the kids (he normally leaves around 6:45 and is home by 5, so earlier and later than needed for kid pick ups).\n\nI don't think I should have to essentially pay my husband to have a day off to be a parent. I don't get compensation for making all the meals, buying groceries for the kids or doing the daytime chauffeuring. Is the time that I spend doing everything every other day not enough to say that he should take the hit for one day of having to be a parent? Since we decided from the beginning that our finances would be separate and expenses 50/50, why now does he get a day off with pay at my expense because he has a job that pays less?

Strictly based on your question Y W B T A if you forced your husband to take a paycut. However, from your post it seems theres like a 70/30 split in household chores, where you do 70% and he does 30%? If that is so, that split was never going to be sustainable as it relies heavily on you to either WFH or become a SAHM. \n\nI suggest you sit down and really look at the division of chores and why most of it falls on you. If you are happy with the way things are you will also have to be happy with sacrificing some potential career options that may clash with your current household set-up.", "NTA it's only financially 50/50 but you are clearly doing most of the labor in the relationship.

And if you were sick or hospitalized or even, God forbid, pass away he would definitely have to take lots more time off.\n\nBut your job is structured in such a way that you CAN make money from home. His seems not to be. Asking him to take a full day off once a month could even harm his career so even though it seems petty it does make sense that he would be concerned about losing out on that day. Because that's what it is, he's losing out, not you're paying him to stay home.\n\nAnd yes you do so much already, hopefully, the day off a month he gets to spend with your children may help him appreciate all your hard work. \n\nActually I just had a thought. You should, if you agree to the scale back make it clear what exactly you do for your family everyday tending to the children, cleaning the house and working full time.\n\nIf he starts putting everything off until the next day when you're back to 'normal' then no.

If your husband is going to lose income so that you can pursue this new job opportunity, you need to reimburse him for that in some way.

That would never work for the vast majority of working parents.", "You have a job which allows you to work from home - meaning that you also take on the majority of childcare if the kids are sick AND you're the one doing the school run every day, with 2 children under the age of 5. That is a lot - so more info would be needed about how your husband pulls his weight. \n\nYou made an agreement about your finances that it should be a 50/50 split, when it comes to bills, otherwise your money is your own. You also happen to make more money than he does. Fair enough - but I expect that there is some jealousy there on his part which might be why he isn't co-operating. After all, if you are earning twice his wage AND taking care of the kids at home... Well, what does he contribute exactly? \n\nNot only that, you are stressed out with your current job, and have found an opportunity than would benefit you greatly at the cost of not being around for childcare for a single day a month. Why isn't your partner supporting you with this? Do you even like each other at this point? \n\nDamn guys. You don't sound like you're working together at all. He's not pulling his weight in childcare, and you're not working together regarding a day's wages. You're fighting about a day's wages at the expense of your children. \n\nESH - more him than you based on the info you gave. You both suck though! You have kids you're raising together. If your agreement is 50/50 split for paying bills, hire someone to pick up and drop off your kids from BOTH your wages. If you didn't work from home in the first place, guess what, you'd both be paying for childcare anyway since you wouldn't be around to do it!
