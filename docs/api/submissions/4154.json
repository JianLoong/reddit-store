She recently got engaged and is planning a big, expensive wedding. She's asked me and our other siblings to contribute financially to the wedding, but I've refused. I don't think it's fair for me to have to pay for her wedding when I have my own financial responsibilities and goals.\n\nMy sister is furious with me and says I'm being selfish and unfair. She's even threatening to cut me out of the wedding party if I don't contribute. Our other siblings are siding with her, but I still don't think I'm in the wrong.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? I want to support my sister, but I also don't want to sacrifice my own financial stability for her wedding.

Of course you are NTA. Her wedding is not your responsibility. Perhaps your sister needs to live within her means rather than burdening everyone else with her problems. OP, your sister has to learn to be an adult, and your family are enabling her poor decisions and bad behavior.", "Absolutely NTA your sister is the selfish one, and entitled to think she can demand money from anyone. If I were you I'd be glad not to be in such a person's wedding party as they will probably be demanding and selfish with that also.

As for being in the wedding party, why would you want to subject yourself to someone that entitled.  If she's this way now, imagine how bad it will get when she's supposed to be bossy and demanding.

Perhaps in other cultures it\u2019s typical to financially contribute for a wedding of a sibling, but not in the US and probably not in most of the West.\n\nNow I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad to say that in place of a gift, if you could pitch in cash for the wedding. Something like 200 or 400 dollars would be okay, which is what you\u2019d likely spend on a gift for your sister\u2019s wedding anyway But any more than that is crossing a line for me.\n\nI know in Israel and parts of Europe it\u2019s common for guests to give cash instead of gifts to offset the cost of the wedding. (A typical gift may be 100 to 150 dollars per guest, for example). In American culture it\u2019s a little strange, but it\u2019s starting to become common for people to do things like opening a \u201choneymoon fund\u201d or \u201cdown payment fund.\u201d So if the couple is cash strapped, maybe a model like this is appropriate.

People will insist on big and expensive weddings when they can only pay for like 10-20% of it. Then guilt friends and families into contributing the rest. You get added to wedding committees and whatsapp groups. And your contribution has already been decided for you. All this without your input.
