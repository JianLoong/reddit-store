We didn\u2019t know each other going into the year but we\u2019ve definitely formed a friendship. We\u2019re not like best friends or anything but we get along well.\n\nWe never really officially discussed boundaries or anything like that we just treat each other with respect and use common sense and that\u2019s worked out for us in the time we\u2019ve been living together.\n\nEvery now and then she\u2019ll tell me about her boyfriend but she\u2019s never shown me any pictures or anything. All I know is he goes to another school a few states and they\u2019ve been together since high school.\n\nOne day she tells me he\u2019s going to visiting because he has a fall break. I didn\u2019t ask any kind of details when she said this and just said ok. \n\n Yesterday, I get a text from her saying that her boyfriend was on his way and asked if I could let him in the room if he shows up before she\u2019s back. However, I didn\u2019t see this text until I get a knock on the door.\n\nI look through the peephole and ask who it is and he announces himself as my roommate\u2019s bf. Now I had never seen this guy before in my life so I didn\u2019t let him. I asked him if he could just wait until she was back from class. He just said sorry to bother you and walked away.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later my roommate comes back with the guy from before. She starts asking me why I didn\u2019t let him in. I told her that I had no idea what her bf looked like and wasn\u2019t comfortable with some random guy coming into the room while I was alone. She told me that I was overreacting and needed to grow up.\n\nThey leave and don\u2019t come back until much later. I\u2019m just about to go to sleep and ask how much longer he\u2019ll be staying and he says probably *just* the next two nights. I ask him *where* he\u2019s staying and he gets this confused look on his face. Then he says he\u2019s staying in our room.\n\nI told both of them I never agreed to anything like that and that he would need to leave. My roommate then proceeded to call me a bitch. I stood firm and finally they both left. My roommate sent me a message saying that they ended up sleeping in his car and was trying to guilt trip me.

It's *common sense* that if someone has an SO visiting with the roommate's consent, they will be around the room and potentially staying the night.  You're in university, on a student budget, a hotel would not be the go to arrangement unless it's necessary.  Where else would you think he'd stay, without specifically making alternate plans??  She brought it up with you ahead of time, as she should.  She could have been clearer, but most adults with *common sense* would not think they need to spell it out like that.  When you said \"ok\", the *common sense* implication is that you're fine with the partner staying over while visiting.\n\nIt was a jerk move on your part to not clarify *anything* with her and make your boundaries known ahead of time so they could arrange another place to stay.  Instead you just say \"ok\", make her think you're fine with the situation, and then spring it on them late in the evening that oh no, you need to get out, when they have not had a chance to budget for, research and book other accommodations.

Bringing her bf who you don\u2019t know to sleep in your shared dorm room?  Nope.", "NAH:  I would say though if he goes to school states away wouldnt the assumption be he's staying the night. Yea she could have been more clear but at the same time I'm surprised you didn't have any follow up questions", "NTA You are not the asshole because you want to feel safe in your dorm room. Each person could have tried better to discuss this more before it happened rather than assuming what statements meant.", "Nope NTA. This happened to me way back in 1986. Room mate at college trusted a stranger and he stole my brand new college logo jacket that my grandma had just bought me.", "ESH.  So you really thought some random guy managed to show up when her boyfriend was coming and introduces himself as her boyfriend.  That\u2019s reaching to a whole new level.  She is because she should have discussed sleeping arrangements, but seriously, unless you share a bedroom with her, having someone she has known for years stay isn\u2019t that hard.  It sounds like you could use some real world experience instead of what sounds like overreaching fear.  He isn\u2019t at all as he sounded polite and did not know she had not asked you.", "YTA. Yeah I get that you didn't let him in when you've never met him... that's fine. But. He should have been allowed to stay in your dorm room when she arrived to introduce you. College is like that and you should have realized that when she said he was visiting that he would be sleeping in her bed. Making your roommate sleep in her bf's car is going to make your whole semester awkward. She's going to hate you for this... and rightly so.", "NTA\n\nI don't think it is fair to assume that it was implied that he would be staying in your dorm when she said he was visiting. There needs to be an explicit conversation about if you are comfortable having her bf stay in your living space and for how long. As far as letting him in the door that is absolutely wild. Like even if you did know that it was for sure him...you don't know him. How awkward and uncomfortable to have a man who is a complete stranger just hanging out in your dorm room waiting for his gf to come back. My roommate freshman year did this. No warning, no asking how we felt about it. He was just hanging out in our dorm all day long while she was in class. The first time I met him, my roommate wasn't even in the room, I just walked in to see a balding man in my dorm. He was just chilling in the TOP BUNK while my other roommate had to hang out in the bottom bunk if she wanted to be able to hang out in our dorm. He stayed all week and my roommate and I had to find other places to hang out the entire day so we were not stuck in the room with our roommates like 30 year old weirdo receding hairline having bf chillin on the top bunk in his pjs watching cartoons.", "NTA.  She clearly doesn't care what happens to you.  Check your college handbook.  Some don't allow people who aren't students to stay in the dorms.  If she keeps bringing it up go to your RA.  This is what they're for.", "Classic example of why \"we never really officially discussed boundaries or anything like that we just treat each other with respect and use common sense\" doesn't actually work out. You guys have different opinions about what's common sense and respect around guests and use of space, and you don't realize it until something comes up. For the future, it's a good idea to discuss a short list of things with new roommates BEFORE they come up: guests, quiet hours, cleanliness standards, shared chores, etc. \n\nWhen you are discussing it in the abstract, you can come up with a guest policy that you both can abide by, and she could plan housing for him during fall break accordingly. But since you left it until now, she feels like you're taking something away from her (and making her boyfriend temporarily homeless), and you feel like you're being forced to accept a stranger in your house. \n\nYou may have to suck it up and accept the guest this time, but the most important thing is to check in with her afterward when you're calmer. Apologize for tempers running hot, and ask if you can talk a bit more about how often he'll be visiting and what to do next time, because you value your friendship and roommate relationship and want to make sure everything works out. And if it doesn't with this roommate, at least you'll know to talk about these things from the beginning with the next roommate.", "I\u2019ve been your roommate before and I\u2019ve been you before. It\u2019s always awkward. Honestly she should have talked to you about it first, and asked if you were comfortable with it, but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s never had a roommate and doesn\u2019t really know boundaries/living with someone who isn\u2019t your family and how to make it work. You get a crash course in A LOT of things in college, especially socially. It\u2019s just something you guys have to talk through and work out. From her perspective, she knows him and knows that he\u2019s safe and just wants to spend more time with him now that she is living on her own for the first time. From your perspective, you don\u2019t know him at all, and he could be anyone and you don\u2019t want some random dude you don\u2019t know in your room, especially when she wasn\u2019t around, or at night because you don\u2019t know if he is safe, and even if he is, it\u2019s still uncomfortable. You\u2019re not a bitch, but neither is she. I think she\u2019s in the wrong here, but she doesn\u2019t know that yet and just can\u2019t see where you\u2019re coming from.", "ESH - I understand it made you uncomfortable but it seems like it would have been better to compromise for one night and tell them that the next night he will have to find somewhere else to stay since it was already so late. I understand not wanting him there when she isn't in the room but you all need to communicate expectations. Ultimately this a shared space that you both have equal claim to. Handling it this way, where you essentially kicked him out late at night, is just causing a conflict and this will likely make your living situation uncomfortable for awhile because of tension. Your roommate should have absolutely asked you ahead of time but you also could have handled this better since you all never talked about rules and boundaries.", "The real AH are colleges that require dorm living for the first year or two, forcing adults to live with people they don't know in a tiny shared space for apartment prices.", "Soft YTA.

Granted you both could have communicated better, but you overreacted when realizing there was a difference in understanding.\n\nIt's been a while since I was a college student, but even back then it wasn't uncommon for someone to have a friend or significant other visit and stay in a shared dorm room for a few days.

When I was an RA, I had to deal with this issue way too many times.", "Agreed with all this. Having had a nightmare experience with my dorm roommate, the biggest advice I'd give to those planning on living in a dorm is to clearly lay out boundaries on day 1 and maybe even sign an informal contract.

Therefore zero reason for any sane person to expect a visitor to stay in a shared dorm room which often times can make studio apartments look huge.\n\nOp's roommate made a profoundly stupid assumption. And doubled down on it by being a huge asshole trying to guilt OP. It is basic manners to ask or discuss someone staying the night in any and all roommate situations. A thousand times so if it's a shared area like many dorms are and no seperate rooms. OP was 100% right to assume they'd made other arrangements like a hotel since it wasn't asked if he was staying there.

My understanding is in most countries a dorm is a group of four or so bedrooms attached to a shared living room and kitchen. There is one student per bedroom.\n\nIn the US, most on campus dorms, especially for first year students is like a double bed hotel room, only the bathroom is down the hall. Roommate and OP sleep in the same room, probably with fewer than two meters between the beds.", "Doesn't matter how likely it is, OP's roommate isn't rooming with a representative, statistically significant sample of the global population, she's rooming with one specific person, OP, and she foolishly made an assumption instead of communicating.", "Big difference between a dorm room and a house.", "Wow I can\u2019t even imagine ahaha.

Two people to a room, identical dresser, bed, desk down each side.  A very few lucky people got single rooms based on a lottery system.

When I was in college we were all excited to be adults, living together away from parents, and we generally supported  each others\u2019 desires to have adult romantic lives whenever it was reasonably possible. Boyfriends and girlfriends slept over often and the rule was to be considerate and flexible on all sides. You didn\u2019t have an absolute right to have your partner (or fwb, whatever) sleep over indefinitely, or to be loud or rude, and you didn\u2019t have an absolute right to ban a roommate\u2019s partner to preserve your own ideal comfort. Seems like you\u2019ll get an N t a ruling here, and I agree it was fine not to let him in til your roommate showed up. After that, pretty selfish and rigid, and I don\u2019t blame your roommate for being mad.", "NTA- this is the second post I\u2019ve read recent where a woman is accused of overreacting about not wanting to let a strange man into a room/house with them. It\u2019s bananas. There is no way in hell I would ever ever do that.", "Sorry OP, but YTA here. Not for not wanting him to stay in your room, but for feigning ignorance over him visiting. \n\nYou knew in advance that your flatmate\u2019s boyfriend lives a few states away, and you know they\u2019ve been together since high school. And you know that the reason he is able to visit on this occasion is because he\u2019s on fall break.  \n\nSurely the context here is clear as day? He\u2019s obviously going to be staying overnight. He lives far away, they\u2019ve been in a long term relationship and not seen each other for a while. She talks about him fairly often. And he\u2019s visiting because he\u2019s on a break from Uni. It\u2019s clearly not a visit for brunch. \n\nBut again, you being uncomfortable with him staying over does not make you the asshole. \n\nHowever your roommate raised it with you in advance and told you that her boyfriend was coming to visit. She didn\u2019t spell it out for you, but I think it should have been extremely clear from the context that he was planning to stay overnight. You heard this and didn\u2019t ask any details. You had the opportunity to ask anything you wanted, if he was getting a hotel, how long he was staying, and you could have told your roommate here that you were uncomfortable with him staying over, which is TOTALLY reasonable. \n\nBut you didn\u2019t do any of that. You just said OK. \n\nAs far as your flatmate knew, that was you giving permission for him to stay over. I think your flatmate was well within her rights to assume she had your permission, since, y\u2019know, you gave it? If someone asks you a question and you say OK, then that\u2019s you answering them. You told her it was fine for him to visit. \n\nWhat did you expect? He was only going to visit for the afternoon after travelling across multiple states to get there? That he was only spending one day of his break with his long-term girlfriend who he hasn\u2019t seen in a while? \n\nI really don\u2019t think you can use the excuse that you didn\u2019t know he was staying over and you never agreed to it, because you did. She told you he was visiting, and you said OK. That\u2019s clear as day to me. \n\nAlso, you say you treat each other with respect, but you don\u2019t seem to have any respect for her.\n\nShe told you in advance that he was visiting during fall break, and gave you an opportunity to speak to her about it, and you just said OK. Surely just as common politeness you\u2019d ask her about their plans and such? Seems outright rude not to, but that might be the Brit in me. \n\nThen she texts you and asks you if you could let her boyfriend in, and you don\u2019t. It\u2019s understandable that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable, and the poor guy apologised for bothering you and then leaves. Your roommate was a little snappy when she came back, but she was probably embarrassed that her boyfriend had been sat on the kerb for half an hour. \n\nThen she and her boyfriend spent the day out of the flat, leaving you in peace. Most school sweethearts in this situation would be spending the day making out in their room and getting handsy with each other, but she clearly respected you enough to leave you in peace for the day and do something else. \n\nAnd then to top it all off, when they finally get home, you\u2019re rude to them and make them sleep in a car because you didn\u2019t understand what you previously agreed to. And now you\u2019re accusing her of trying to guilt trip you. Well, you probably should feel guilty! \n\nYou\u2019ve probably ruined their entire trip, all because you agreed to him \u2018visiting\u2019, apparently without taking a second to consider that he would probably want to be staying over. \n\nYeah, YTA.", "NTA. She should have asked explicitly if she wanted to allow him to sleep in your shared room.  You would still have been perfectly within your rights to say No, I'm not comfortable with that.  \n\nDon't allow her to guilt you over inisting on expected levels of privacy.", "NTA, but *almost ESH*. I mean, the right time to clarify where he was sleeping was when she mentioned he was visiting over the break, not *at bedtime* once he's there. It was a little shitty to not let him sleep the one night. But at the same time, there must be a common lounge area or a library open late that they could have slept in instead of his car. \ud83e\udd14", "NTA, any guests in a shared living situation are all agree or no.\n\nYou can veto any guest she wants, and she can veto any guest you want.", "NTA.  She knew he was coming...that's what hotels and sleazy motels are for", "YTA. You sound extremely immature and like you played stupid about who her boyfriend was, and about him staying over. Your roommate gave you plenty of notice and you didn't bother to ask for any details, but then made the unilateral decision that she couldn't have a guest.", "Gently, ESH. This is an INCREDIBLY predictable outcome of \"We never really officially discussed boundaries or anything like that we just treat each other with respect and use common sense.\" Y'all created an environment where you don't have common rules and you don't have explicit boundaries, and then were shocked when invisible assumptions on both sides weren't met.\n\nWhen she said her boyfriend was visiting, common sense to her (and to me!) was that she meant he was staying in your room, and when you said okay, you meant you didn't mind that. Common sense to you said he was staying somewhere else. This is why you need to communicate.\n\nYou absolutely don't need to let a strange man into your room, or let him sleep in your room! You DO need to communicate about boundaries, though. I GUARANTEE you that a lot of the people in your dorm would agree that her interpretation is the \"common sense\" interpretation...bc common sense is bullshit, and you all grew up in very different communities and families of origin, so you all have different cultural expectations in certain areas. It's been a minute since I was in college, but I knew people who had sexiling agreements; I knew people who didn't care who their roomie had over as long as pants stayed on; I knew people who would never even bring their partner back to the room to hang out because it felt disrespectful to the roomie. All of them thought they way was the correct, respectful, obvious way of doing things.\n\nShe is the bigger AH here because she should have communicated about this better, and she has a higher burden of communication here that she failed to meet--while I understood what she meant with that check in, that doesn't mean it was good enough. She needed to get an explicit yes first.\n\nLet this be a learning experience that you need to talk about things like boundaries around visitors with every person you live with from now on.", "YTA because you failed to follow up her question of \"is it okay for boyfriend to visit [FROM OUT OF STATE]\" with your own question of \"why are you asking me if it's okay for your boyfriend to visit\" to clarify. You said it was okay. As in you okayed it and failed to clarify what you were okaying. And then when he showed up on the premise of you okaying it already, you now decide to ask questions and shocked Pikachu face?

How about asking to see his ID??
