Cam likes doodling and using certain online animation apps, but her preferred way to express herself is through street art such as graffiti. I have found an art class that specializes in graffiti for Cameron, as well as gotten her connected with specific zones where graffiti is allowed. She\u2019s staying out of trouble and it makes her happy, so I don\u2019t see any issue with it and encourage her hobby.\n\nSome context about my sister-in-law Sydney is that she has two daughters, my nieces Eden and Ava, and her husband Benjamin is not involved with the girls at all. My brother-in-law is the kind of guy who brags about he\u2019s such a man because he\u2019s never changed any diapers or attended parent-teacher meetings and Sydney does it all. He\u2019s seemingly oblivious to the fact that this does not impress nor earn him respect from other fathers his age.\n\nSydney constantly makes excuses for Benjamin\u2019s lack of involvement with Eden and Ava. Things along the lines of how it\u2019s her responsibility as the mother or that since he makes more money, it is not his responsibility to step up as their father. (Sydney seems to have internalized misogyny herself.)\n\nI bring all that up because Sydney has become very vocal about her disapproval of Cam\u2019s graffiti hobby and a lot of her complaints seemed to be misogynistic. Things along the lines of how Cameron is fourteen, becoming a young woman, and needs to start acting like it. And that I should move her into classes for a more appropriate (\u201cfeminine\u201d) form of art like watercolors.\n\nI told Sydney that, unless Cam wants to, I would not be changing her art class or discouraging her graffiti. She\u2019s staying out of trouble and it makes her happy, I see no issue with her hobby. Sydney called me irresponsible and said to think about the kind of potential partners Cam would attract with a hobby like graffiti. She then said that if Cameron keeps doing graffiti, she will eventually hang around a bad crowd and get into drugs.\n\nI told Sydney that she doesn\u2019t have room to criticize the way I support Cam\u2019s passions when her own husband is barely involved with Eden and Ava. Sydney and I got into an argument, where I admittedly was yelling back at her. My wife had us de-escalate, told Syndey off, and we left. Once we got home and things cooled off, my wife explained that she did not regret telling Sydney off over the drug comment. But throwing Benjamin\u2019s lack of involvement in Sydney\u2019s face was just a low blow on my end. And that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right since I could have addressed Sydney\u2019s comment without bringing the situation with Benjamin into it.\n\nI do see my wife\u2019s side and realize that bringing up Benjamin was a low blow. The two friends I brought it up to, however, said that Sydney had it coming and that, in a way, I helped Sydney because she needed to look at herself and her own family dynamics in the mirror.

But she could have reasonable concerns that she's communicating poorly.\n\nGraffiti is, without a doubt, associated with gang behavior.  If you don't see that, you're either being intentionally obtuse or incredibly naive.  Sure, there is a \"legitimate\" graffiti community that only \"tags\" legally--and sometimes produces stunning murals, which are a very legit art form of their own.  But that's rare.  And, yes, by association, if you don't at least make your own daughter aware of the link, people may pigeonhole your own daughter into an \"undesirable\" group, which may hinder her ability to fit in, make friends, have play-dates, and have an \"easier\" social life.  If you're having the conversations, then, great.  But you still do have to be concerned--as a parent--with how others perceive your daughter.\n\nHaving a daughter myself, yes, it's incredibly hard to socialize girls.  OOH, I love the fact that she's a (toddler) tomboy.  Certainly makes it easier for me as a father to buy toy cars instead of barbies.  But, we do recognize that not being able to fit in with girls can cause significant social harm.\n\nI don't think it was an issue to bring up the husband.  She opened the door to criticism, so she can get fucked.  But, it doesn't sound like you have any idea about \"misogyny\" as you appear to be misusing it, and it's entirely worth having a discussing with your wife about how you want to parent your daughter.

Making disrespectful comments about someone and expecting no coments back at you or acting oh-so-hurt about it is pure hypocrisy.", "NTA Because she simple needs to understand that her own ideas around gender roles had lead to co-parent with an absent partner.\n\nIf she has picked better then maybe she wouldn\u2019t be a single married mother.", "I agree with your wife. The uninvolved husband comment was irrelevant to Sydney being so judgy about your daughter. That had nothing to do with the issue at hand but I still say NTA.. Sydney was way out of line and I'm glad your wife had your back with that.", "NTA why would you make her change her hobby into one that would attract misogynists", "NTA.\n\nI would like to know, is it about gender?\nIs Benjamin uninvolved because he has daughters or would he be equally uninvolved with sons?\n\nThere is a difference between a father and a dad/daddy.\n\nThe first one provides the sperm and hopefully the basic material necessities as required by law.\n\nThe second one gives emotional support, encourages interests, is the no.1-fan, happy about every accomplishment.", "ESH I feel like your comparing apples and oranges here. \n\nShe's saying, \"I don't think that hobby is appropriate for her child her age\"\n\nYou reply, \"well your husband is a terrible father\"\n\nYou see how that isn't the same thing and not actually on the same scale. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, her reasons for objecting to graffiti make her an asshole in her own right.\n\nAlthough, I also find it strange that there are classes on it, as I personally don't believe graffiti should be encouraged but if it stops the little darlings from doing it on train cars and being more creative than a tag then I suppose it's beneficial.", "Yta\n\nYour comment about Husband was meant to hurt her.\n\nIt had no relationship to the discussion at hand.   \n\nYou had the right to address her parenting as she was criticizing yours.\n\nBut no, your mean comment will not magically elicit change.", "I think in this case, I agree with your wife, making it ESH except your wife.\n\nAs long as graffiti doesn't cross over into vandalism, there's obviously nothing wrong with it, so your SIL had no right to be nosing into your daughter's affairs.\n\nBut you didn't really act well either and engaged in the mudslinging too.\n\nYour friends are right that Sydney had it coming and deserve it, but that doesn't mean it was okay from a moral standpoint, either. You could have been the better man, I think.", "NTA. You could have been more subtle and asked if you should use Benjamin's \"hands off\" approach to parenting but I see no issues here. Her criticism is not needed nor wanted.", "NTA.\n\nIt WAS a bit of a low blow, but she did have it coming, and it was a good retort for her misogynistic rants. When she was talking about \"thinking about potential partners\", the Mean Me would be tempted to answer \"do you mean one like your husband, who thinks you as a woman are \"less than\" because you do not make as much money as him, and all menial works are your job because of that? I would never want something like that for my daughter.\"", "NTA. \u201cPreparing my daughter to attract potential partners like the one you\u2019ve found is exactly what I will NOT be doing. Thank you for your concern\u201d", "NTA\n\n> Sydney called me irresponsible and said to think about the kind of potential partners Cam would attract with a hobby like graffiti.\n\nWho does she want for Cam? A husband like Benjamin who doesn\u2019t actually parent his kids and leaves it all to their mother? \n\nBringing up Sydney and Benjamin\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t a low blow and was important to the argument. I just don\u2019t think you brought it up in the right way. You made it a hit on Benjamin (and his lack of parenting as opposed to your active parenting) when really it should\u2019ve been used as a hit on Sydney\u2019s poor decision making skills when choosing a suitable partner. She has NO BUSINESS thinking she knows what an appropriate partner is when she picked a dude like Benjamin to marry and procreate with.", "LOts of people are missing the point here. The question was if he is the AH for his comment about the lack of involvment of Benjamin. And yep... he is.\n\nSo YTA.  \n\n\nBut... For EVERYTHING ELSE he is absolutely not. It's amazing how he supports his daughter's passions. Their family dynamic is so much better than that of SIL. And yes, SIL has issues and her partner is a very bad father. But that was not the question here.", "You did good NTA\nWas it a low blow sure but it was warranted\nGood for you\n\nAnd keep supporting your daughter\n\nYour SIL needs to work on herself", "NTA. She had it coming and one day she will snap out of her tradwifey bubble and be like what have I done with my life!", "You might be a bit of an asshole for the comment but I honestly don\u2019t care. The only way I see an argument like this escalating to the point of creaming if she was pushing. \n\nAlso, \u2018what kind of partners is she going to find with such a hobby?\u2019 Is such a bizarre take, especially since the kid is 14. \n\nYou seem like a great parent. NTA", "Sydney can take a long walk on a short pier.\n\nShe's TA. None of her holier-than-thou business.", "ESH. But I'm not even mad at you. Divorce them. \n\nSIL is TA for all the bigoted stuff she said concerning your parenting and daughter. And you shot back (amazingly but unnecessarily) with your own critique of their family after getting defensive (for good reason). SIL didn't like how her medicine tasted.", "NTA. Your wife is enabling your SIL\u2019s internalised misogyny and by extension encouraging her to remain a victim of it.", "I know the hivemind has already chosen n-t-a, but I think you need to hear more ESH. \n\nThough I'll first say, thanks for sticking up for your daughter. You're doing great there, and you're right about your SIL having misogynistic views that your daughter doesn't need to hear. \n\nHowever it bothers me that you keep bringing up SILs misogyny, but when it came to pushing back, you didn't actually target her behavior or her bad opinions, you instead criticized the man in her life. She is already taking on the physical and mental load of caring for her household, why should she also be blamed for the fact her husband isn't doing anything? This is her life choice and she doesn't deserve to be coddled for it, but blaming the wife for not domesticating the husband is a form of misogyny. If you really care about the unaddressed misogyny of others, then you might want to think about why her husband was the first thing you thought to use against her, otherwise you just come off as really sanctimonious and a little hypocritical. \n\nIf her husband bothers you so much, you should be the first to tell him that no one thinks it's cool that he's a live in deadbeat.", "NTA. She FAFO, her opinion was unwanted. We can't always be the bigger person, we're human. Clapping back ensures that she doesn't do it again. \n\nI am, however, very worried about Eden and Ava.", "NTA. Your friends were right: she had it coming....", "ESH. Your wife is right. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, and taking that low blow puts you at the same level as her", "ESH  \n\n\nYour sister should pipe down about how you raise your daughter with her questionable crap, but you are no better. Going for the husband is a low blow. Specially because what truly bothers you there is that they have a more traditional gender roles thing that works for them.   \n\n\nYour whole feminist male vibe shows in everything you write. Apparently you know better what would be suitable for your sister's family. You know better than them! Only, you don't.   \n\n\nSo, my advice is that both of you remain cordial and stop being in each other's business. It's damn obvious your feminist crap is incompatible with her traditionalist crap. And it's ok to disagree!", "Sydney is a massive AH, but it really bothers me that OP keeps talking about her internalized misogyny, then turns around and uses her husband as an insult instead of her own behavior, as if she should be blamed for that. I guess you could argue that Sydney should dump a guy like that, but her husbands shortcomings are not something SHE should be criticized about - her nosiness and outdated attitudes are. OP didn't actually criticize Sydney, OP criticized the man in her life.\n\nLike, imagine the following: \n\nSydney: \"I rudely disagree with your parenting choices\"  \nOP: \"lol well at least my kids have a dad.\"\n\nThe two things are unrelated, and regardless of what kind of person she is, Sydney is already dealing with the physical and mental load of dealing with her household, coping with a shitty husband in a way that society has conditioned her to do, it is not feminist behavior to then blame her for not training her husband as well. To be clear, I'm not saying this to defend Sydney in any way, she sucks, I'm only looking at the misogyny angle because OP kept bringing it up at as a (valid) dig at her. \n\nAnyway all that to say, Sydney is a massive AH, bigger than OP. I appreciate OP for supporting their daughter and sticking to their guns on this. But OP DID use  Sydneys husband as a low blow instead of actually addressing her behavior, as well as being really sanctimonious about misogyny while being kinda misogynist themself. OP is the one who came here asking aita, that's why I personally wouldn't let them off the hook from esh. All the y tas are buried now anyway.", "He seems to have nothing to do with anything regarding his daughters.", "Totally agree. It really bothered me that OP is being so sanctimonious about her internalized misogyny, but criticizes the man in her life instead of actually addressing her behavior or shitty opinions.", "This!!!! \n\nYour wife was right OP, listen to her.\n\nESH.", "No. The argument basically boils down to \u201cyou\u2019re judging my parenting while your own husband doesn\u2019t give a shit about his daughters, so maybe you should look inside your glass house first\u201d. NTA", "With the right hobby, you won\u2019t have any money for drugs.", "No.", "You are just two data points out of millions of people.\n\nIn general involved parenting mitigates teenage delinquency.", "Absentee parenthood still applies.  It affects the self worth of a child if they feel like their parent isn\u2019t involved in their upbringing.", "It has a lot more to do with your zip code than parental involvement, we just don't like talking about that.", "You are so right, it isn't exclusive to North America. I'm from Austria, and in Austria and Germany most people want to live this cliche. Women als well, btw.", "How is pointing that out a low blow? If someone goes in on you and your parenting, and says rude and disparaging things about your kid, then they should be prepared for whatever comes back in my opinion. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it. You sound like a good Dad. Your wife is just trying to keep the peace, which is understandable on some level, but also fuck your sister in law.", "It's such a weird and frankly unnecessary insult. \n\nLike, the fact that my husband is an involved father who genuinely likes spending time with his kids and being a parent is so threatening to someone who doesn't do the bare minimum of getting the title of \"dad\". So they attack his masculinity? In like a 1950s way?", "They weren\u2019t replying to coffee historian, they were replying to a different comment about why certain men have kids."]}
