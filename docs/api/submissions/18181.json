I have found an art class that specializes in graffiti for Cameron, as well as gotten her connected with specific zones where graffiti is allowed. She\u2019s staying out of trouble and it makes her happy, so I don\u2019t see any issue with it and encourage her hobby.\n\nSome context about my sister-in-law Sydney is that she has two daughters, my nieces Eden and Ava, and her husband Benjamin is not involved with the girls at all. My brother-in-law is the kind of guy who brags about he\u2019s such a man because he\u2019s never changed any diapers or attended parent-teacher meetings and Sydney does it all. He\u2019s seemingly oblivious to the fact that this does not impress nor earn him respect from other fathers his age.\n\nSydney constantly makes excuses for Benjamin\u2019s lack of involvement with Eden and Ava. Things along the lines of how it\u2019s her responsibility as the mother or that since he makes more money, it is not his responsibility to step up as their father. (Sydney seems to have internalized misogyny herself.)\n\nI bring all that up because Sydney has become very vocal about her disapproval of Cam\u2019s graffiti hobby and a lot of her complaints seemed to be misogynistic.

And that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right since I could have addressed Sydney\u2019s comment without bringing the situation with Benjamin into it.\n\nI do see my wife\u2019s side and realize that bringing up Benjamin was a low blow. The two friends I brought it up to, however, said that Sydney had it coming and that, in a way, I helped Sydney because she needed to look at herself and her own family dynamics in the mirror.

But she could have reasonable concerns that she's communicating poorly.\n\nGraffiti is, without a doubt, associated with gang behavior.  If you don't see that, you're either being intentionally obtuse or incredibly naive.  Sure, there is a \"legitimate\" graffiti community that only \"tags\" legally--and sometimes produces stunning murals, which are a very legit art form of their own.  But that's rare.  And, yes, by association, if you don't at least make your own daughter aware of the link, people may pigeonhole your own daughter into an \"undesirable\" group, which may hinder her ability to fit in, make friends, have play-dates, and have an \"easier\" social life.  If you're having the conversations, then, great.  But you still do have to be concerned--as a parent--with how others perceive your daughter.\n\nHaving a daughter myself, yes, it's incredibly hard to socialize girls.  OOH, I love the fact that she's a (toddler) tomboy.  Certainly makes it easier for me as a father to buy toy cars instead of barbies.  But, we do recognize that not being able to fit in with girls can cause significant social harm.\n\nI don't think it was an issue to bring up the husband.  She opened the door to criticism, so she can get fucked.  But, it doesn't sound like you have any idea about \"misogyny\" as you appear to be misusing it, and it's entirely worth having a discussing with your wife about how you want to parent your daughter.
