Tuition has been rising in price exponentially for years and I don't see that changing. \n\nThat is YOUR money. Not hers. You saved it to be used for a purpose - for her education.

The money was for college not a get rich quick scheme. If she is insistent about starting this business I would make a compromise with her (if you're able).

Not every parent is smart or willing enough to do that. Your daughter should be grateful for everything you\u2019ve done so far and understand that she is making a very risky decision that could easily backfire.

I assume you never promised her that she has x amount of money that she can use in whatever way she wants, you only promised her that if she wants to go to college she won't have to worry about the payments 'cause you'll take care of them. Thus you're not breaking any promises to her nor are you \"stealing\" her her money. As for her change in career, it's your right to use your money how you want it, as well as tell your honest opinion to your daughter that you think she's making a mistake, but I would advice to compromise; offer her to give her some money as loan (aka she'll have to pay you back at a certain amount of time, it's not like you're gifting her that money or it's hers from the start) and let her do it and, if it's such a bad idea as you think it is, let her learn it from experience and not just because you told her so. Also,inform her that if she drops out and at any point decides to go back to college (and assume start over her studies there), inform her that the only tuition money you'll be paying will be the amount of tuition money you ended up not paying 'cause she dropped out and she'll have to pay the rest of the tuition herself. That way she'll think this more through, since her actions will have their natural consequencies and she'll have to decide which kind of consequencies she wants to experience.

This way she leaves all her options open and perhaps you can support her emotionally while she tries to make this new dream work. But NTA for not investing in her business.
