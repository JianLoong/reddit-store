Especially if it contained something expensive like a laptop.", "YTA. People do this all the time.

I have no issue with moving for people who CANNOT WALK FAR. Those priority seats are for people who CANNOT WALK MAINLY. If you are ABLE TO WALK you move. No matter what disability you have. I will not disclose my disabilities online as that\u2019s private to me but I have a disability card that proves I need a carer when I go in certain places. How the hell can I manage to sit further back for people who cannot physically walk but you can\u2019t? I have a disabled card for those who don\u2019t believe me when I\u2019m out but if someone who. CLEARLY NEEDED the seat more than I did came on the bus id move because I\u2019m not an entitled AH.", "A sprained wrist is MOT a disability. It's a very minor injury", "So this person who reserved their seat, you realise they could also have an invisible disability and you just decided what was ok and what not?", "op : my wrists hurt but it\u2019s not a diagnosed disability \n\nop 2 minutes later when everyone is mad: I have a DISABILITY and you are ABLEIST", "Well thats the reason why people get annoyed and move stuff as well. Everyone does that doesn't mean its right.", "Because there was no option of sitting further back for me, which you would know if you were actually reading my comments. There was an option for HER, because other people would move for her, but not for me. My solution had both disabled people seated and comfortable. Yours would have her seated while the person with invisible disabilities suffers. If you can't see how that's ableist, I can't help you.", "Wait, where is this initial post? Was it two minutes ago?", "Nevermind, I figured out how to look for it. Are we assuming he still has an injured wrist 300 days later rather than it being a disability, though?", "It means, it's sometimes the only way to secure a table.\nIf people don't take the initiative to do that themselves, that's on them.\nEvery coffee shop knows people do this. They don't ask customers to leave because they do this.\nIf it annoys you, secure your own table. But you don't move peoples stuff because they were clever enough to secure a table BEFORE ordering. Not ordering first and then HOPING a table will be available"]}
