I was absolutely fuming about how rude this was. So I took her bag and water bottle and put them on the floor next to the table, and then my friend and I sat at the table.\n\nShe'd clearly done this for the same reason we moved it: there weren't any available tables at the time. I'm sure if she waited how we planned to, one would have opened up.\n\nShe came back and glared at us and told us not to touch her stuff. She seemed so huffy and offended that it made us seem like we were the ones in the wrong, but you can't just put your laptop bag on a table and then assume it's yours, right? Or AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Since I keep being asked: I am from the UK. It seems like some redditors from outside the USA agree that you shouldn't reserve seats with bags, but Americans tend to think it's fine. \n\nAlso, my past post about disability keeps coming up. I have since been diagnosed (I said in the post that we were still in the process of figuring out what was wrong). Whether or not you think my disability is good enough to use priority seating when I'm unable to balance myself on a moving bus, please don't post ableist things about it (especially about invisible disabilities not being real or good enough).

Unless it was an emergency of course!", "THANK YOU. I live in Wellington and crime isn\u2019t even that bad around here, but I\u2019d never leave anything on a table unattended! It\u2019s wild people actually do this", "Your experience is probably biased by you having entitled etiquette", "The line is for coffee orders, not tables. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t empty, someone\u2019s belongings were there.  If I\u2019m at a table with my stuff, and get up to go to the restroom and you move my stuff and take my table\u2026 you\u2019re moving, 100%", ">\tIt\u2019s poor planning\n\nOr it\u2019s being respectful to the people that got there before you", "YTA. Being in line is not an indication that you want a table. Loads of folks get coffee and leave.", "NTA OP and I\u2019m sorry this thread is filled with people who don\u2019t understand that cultural differences exist. Trying to occupy a table without actually occupying a table is rude in my books too", "I have literally never once seen or heard of people doing this.", "Not before you order.", "Never seen anyone do it. People usually buy and then sit or go to a place where they come to you to take an order. If I am on my own I sit on the bar stools rather than a table for two or four.", "And it's bullshit.", "no they don't\n\nno idea what kind of place you live in", "Everyone my ass. Speak for yourself", "They quite easily could be paying separately. Where I live, you don't just place your shit down on a table and claim it for yourself. Order, sit down.", "This is extremely normal where I live. In fact, at busy cafes, employees will tell you to go claim seating first before ordering, or they won't let you order a coffee to stay.", "Not everyone has visible disabilities", "Yeah these comments are insane. This girl was being super rude. What are these people smoking? You aren't entitled to claim a table at a busy place. OP is in the right here and I'll die on that hill.", "Different issues. In fact quite opposite. Each thing you do is a transactional event. Queuing at the grocery is part of the event \"paying for your stuff\" waiting like a reasonable adult for a parking spot is again part of the event of \"parking your car\" not part of grocery shopping itself. You may as well have said it was all right for me to move your car because you hadn't bought your groceries yet. You can't save your parking spot with your car if you haven't made your purchase yet. Does that sound reasonable?  Thats the same as saying you can't sit down yet because you haven't paid for coffee, they are both you parking your property. Everyone who has ever been in a cafe or grocery store knows that buying a coffee doesn't guarantee you a seat and buying groceries doesn't guarantee you a parking spot. That's why most people usually park their property first", "The difference is that you can actually ask a person if they are willing to share their table with you. I've shared my table with strangers countless times, it's just common courtesy in a busy place.", "You leave your bags alone in a pret?", "I'm not sure where you are from in the UK, but in London, this is absolutely normal.  It's often busy,  and you don't want to buy food to eat in, only to find there is nowhere to sit.  Plus, if you are carrying bags, etc, you often won't have enough hands to carry them and get your food.  Perfectly normal to offload your coat and bag and then go up to order.", "I missed the part where a laptop bag can claim seats", "WTF? are you in the US? That's an insane jump to violence. geez!", "It might be expected, but it\u2019s still rude", "As someone else in LA, I think it's total BS to \"\"save\"\" a table. This kind of thing is why we end up never having anything open for people to take once they get their food. Heard Disney World banned this, and it makes sense.", "Also Aussie, and only see this if there are multiple people and then one stays at the table while the others order. Not leaving things unattended to claim a table.", "Not sure, I'm in London a fair bit and rarely see that. It's very much ingrained not to leave belongings unattended. Usually you ask someone nearby to watch your things if you nip to the bathroom but not to order as you should usually order first unless it's table service", "It\u2019s the worst when people do this at busy shops, the person that just got their drink might even finish it before the camper has finished ordering.", "Same", "Don\u2019t leave your belongings unattended in public", "I'm a redditor outside of the US and this is very common where I live. \n\nAND no one will touch the bag or steal the stuff. It's even normal to leave your bag on the 3rd floor then go back down to the counter to order. \n\nOP, YTA because you moved someone's stuff and also because you're generalizing commenters.", "I can't believe all the people disagreeing. You don't touch someone else's stuff. Whoever gets the table first, by sitting at it, or putting their stuff on it and then going to the line or the bathroom, it's their table. I'm from England and live in USA and it's the same in both places, OP is full of it.\n\nHowever, I would expect the one outlier AH to complain about this in UK, not so much in USA.\n\nPeople have moved our stuff before when we're in the bathroom or in line, or just sat at the table with our stuff there. We were not happy, nor would they be happy if we did that to them. But nobody has ever put our stuff on the floor. If they did, there would be a big problem.", "> It is only borderline OK if two people go in and one sits and the other orders.\n\nFunctionally I don't think that's any different, it's still rude and entitled. With that said, I'm a lot more likely to sit at an empty table with a bag at it than to start a fight with someone doing an illicit reservation.", "> Anyway if you\u2019re unhappy with a place policy / availability go somewhere else and don\u2019t touch people belonging.\n\nI'm pretty sure the policy there wasn't \"a bag guarantees you a seat even before you've ordered\" so maybe laptop girl should go somewhere with a policy that fits her needs?", "I\u2019m in Australia and if you tried that and left your table it\u2019s absolutely fair game. Either take the table and sit at it or wait in line and grab a table once you\u2019ve ordered", "Are we glossing over the fact that leaving stuff unattended on a table is *begging* for it to get stolen? Like, am I just a weirdo who wouldn't risk plopping my laptop on a table and expecting it to be there when I got back??? Do people really do this?", "There's no guarantee OP was going to stay and sit. People come in all the time and order to leave. If OP and friend were planning to stay, they should have grabbed a seat when one was available and had the other place both orders. There's nothing wrong with bag holding a seat. Imagine if they'd done that if the bagger had gone to use the restroom? It's rude and your poor planning for not grabbing a seat in a full coffee shop is not their problem.\n\nOP YTA.", "So she has to carry a laptop and a water bottle in line? And then carry laptop, water bottle,  her drink,  and a snack to a table too? His was she rude?", "OP could have claimed it first. They had a group of 2, and could easily have sat one person down while the other ordered.\n\nOP's just mad they didn't think of that.", "Justify it whoever you like, are you still going to come off as an asshole to a lot of people. And the one time you come back to find people there and you\u2019re back gone\u2026 what are you gonna do, Miya Ponsetto?", "That doesn't affect my point - but I agree, it was very unwise.", "I don't agree with you, but you make your point well! No idea why you'd be downvoted for that.\n\n(Mind you, I'm infamous for asking two pairs of people each on a table for four to move together to free a table for my group of four at a busy lunch!)", "Are you in a sleepy regional town? Because otherwise that\u2019s how your stuff gets nicked", "It doesn't, I guess I'm just horrified people do this and think their stuff is \"holding\" a seat, when they are just lucky its even *still there* when they get back", "Thanks!  I\u2019m confused as well lol, but I find that people who don\u2019t usually have to deal with life solo sometimes don\u2019t get it."]}
