To top it off, I had my earplugs in and white noise on, meaning they must've been pretty darn loud to wake me up. I ended up stepping out of my room and checking the common area, only to see my roommate's door halfway open and hear him having a loud conversation with his girlfriend. I texted him, politely requesting him to quiet down, as I was too sleepy to confront them.

He heard no lies and probably already knows how you feel. It just sucks to hear that clarified when hearing that being told to a third party.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you cussed them out, sounds like you cussed *about* them to someone else.", "NTA\n\nThey were being obnoxiously loud at a time where you were clearly trying to sleep. You said this wasn\u2019t a one off event. I think him having his gf over all time when she doesn\u2019t live there is kinda disrespectful. It\u2019s your space too.\n\nHis response was to leave you on read when you asked that they quiet down. He doesn\u2019t seem very considerate of your feelings. You were frustrated and venting to your best friend. I think it\u2019s his own fault for the way you blew up.", "NTA- but you\u2019re allowed to vent but accept the consequences. It\u2019s likely that your friendship will last longer than his relationship, but I could see her not liking you.", "NTA. But you certainly could have handled it with more grace and adulthood.", "ESH \n\nobviously them for being loud and inconsiderate, but you could have handled it so much better.", "ESH - They clearly should not have been that loud at 5am but you fell back asleep so this really isnt as big of a deal as you\u2019re treating it.", "ESH. \n\nRoommate and girlfriend suck for being inconsiderate.\n\nYou suck for not confronting them in the moment and in person.", "NTA\n\nThough your next action is to have an honest conversation. Walk up to him in the common area, greet him and ask to speak about something. When you sit down simply hold eye contact for about 3-5 seconds before speaking.

Then talk about the stuff that frustrated you originally and ask how he would like to set boundaries and expectations from this point forward.\n\nYou do that and it goes well, you'll be the best of buds.", "NTA.

You probably should have talked to him instead. Just told the friend you were tired because the roommate woke you at 5 and left it at that until you were alone or had talked directly to the rm", "ESH- there's a reasonable expectation of quiet after midnight when you live with other people. You've gotta be pretty loud to be heard in a private room with background noise and ear plugs. But you were rude instead of going to him the next day to discuss this issue. You need better communication skills to make this work.", "No", "Yes. YTA. They were inconsiderate but you were just a flat out jerk for talking shit.", "YTA\n\nIt's not their fault you stayed up too late playing on your computer.\n\nConsidering you fell right back asleep I al assuming they either got the message, or, and thus might be wild, you simply woke up at the end of a cycle to some noise, but not the levels you are claiming them to be.", "ESH\n\nLmaaaooooo \ud83d\ude02\n\nWelcome to the real world. 8.5 hours of commute/work is nothing. Yeah, it\u2019s good to relax after working but you make it seem like it was worse then it really is. Also, you stayed up until 1am so I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t that tired. \n\nWere you able to go back to sleep? It seems like you just wanted to complain.\n\nYes, they should be more considerate but damn you just sound so whiny. \n\nESH", "ESH\n\n> she's annoying as shit and her ass is over 24/7\n\nShe literally is not, as you just established:\n\n> I ended up chilling on my computer until 12:30 and fell asleep around 1 AM. My roommate still wasn't back as his door was wide open and the room dark, so I figured he was out at some Halloween college party.", "NTA for asking them to be quiet but TA for saying what you did. You owe your roommate an apology. It\u2019s easy enough to simply forget or not realise how loud you\u2019re being in a shared apartment, and they did quiet down when you asked. He has every right to have his girlfriend over, and you can have a calm and adult conversation about being loud without making it a big drama. Your roommate has apologised and taken responsibility, so should you.", "yta for quite an exaggeration", "Alright this may irritate people and they may disagree strongly with this but\n\nBefore this incident, did you guys often go out partying until late hours?\n\nIf before he had a girlfriend it was common for you guys to go out and come home late, have a history if partying then YTA. It was common behavior, you can't expect it to just magically stop because you didn't go out with him that night. He probably wasn't even thinking about you or how it affected you.\n\nIf before he had a gf, coming in late wasn't a common thing, he was typically back by a reasonable hour, you guys didnt party together then no he's the asshole.", "ur right, I'm still trying to get accustomed to adult life and I overreacted here. It's fine, we made up and agreed to do a gym session together tomorrow.", "I agree, we're thankfully chill now. going to the gym tomorrow and probably dinner after. Hopefully this won't happen again", "You handled it well. Nta", "All things considered, I think you handled it fine. In the moment you were polite, and venting is venting- you didn't intend for your rm or his gf to hear. It's just embarrassing. It sounds like you've already dealt with it and moved on.", "NTA\n\nbut i think you could of handled it better and venting is totally fine but just be careful of your surroundings and always know that there will be consequences to actions", "NTA You were just venting to your friend. Its good he apologized anyway. Its tough living with someone else. Ive been there done that. Its alot of communicating and acomodating.", "NTA truths was told", "So, you did the same as him? This is petty aF especially considering this is the first time it happened. You were sleep deprived and angry but you should apologize to both of them.", "ESH.\nThey shouldn't have been loud, but you literally could see his door being open and instead of speaking to him, you... Chose to text? Jeez", "Not the asshole , next time piss in his face to show dominance", "What does the question mark after stating the girlfriends gender mean? Lol", "NTA\n\nIt was the truth", "NTA. They lack consideration and awareness.  So now he's aware he's not the only one there.", "Nta. \"You could have handled it better\". No. They needed to hear it.", "I saw that you guys are going to the gym together tomorrow. That's good. Personally, of use it as a quick talking point. \"Hey, sorry that you overheard me saying some not too nice shit. You guys woke me up and I was really exhausted from work and traveling. Would you mind just trying to keep the noise down when you know I'm sleeping?\" There. Done.", "You're NTA but you're immature, you could've went to their room and said something like: guys sorry to interrupt you but I'm tired and I'm trying to sleep can you lower your voices?\n\nThey will feel ashamed this way and would never raise their voices again.\n\nThis you could've kept your cool with your roommate and his GF", "People are allowed to vent. It wasn't his plan for them to hear him.\n\nAITA always coming like people should always be perfect. Well, no one is and he handled it well.\n\nEdit. Only thing I would have changed is actually have a conversation with them about it when it happened.", "Yeah why not just tell them to shut up?", "Did you read the post? Because in the post it says this is not the first time it has happened.", "You handled it just fine. I think the roommate realizes how suffocating the gf is for you if your ve ting to a friend. \n\nIt would be good to sit him down and let him know that you dont mind that he has a gf but her being over all the time is becoming too much for you. And you no longer feel comfortable or relaxed in the house. You need her to stick to weekends and one weekday night. You need more days that she isn't there as it's too much for you.", "You sure are, ikkle baby gwumpy because of an 8.5 hour day at 19 years old \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "You\u2019re voicing your feelings after he left them on read\ud83d\ude2d justified", "NTA.  Your roommate was completely inconsiderate and his gf should not be at your apartment 24/7.  It is time to establish some ground rules.", "NTA - he knows he lives in a shared space, and intoxicated or not, there's no way he couldn't expect some type of complaints if you already sent a message. Most people just aren't used to HEARING how they're screwing up. I would stand my ground if it were brought up again.", "NTA but you should probably talk with them or just your roommate", "NTA, he/they now know the behaviour is getting under your skin. Avoiding eye contact says it all. I hope you get better roomates after this.", "op did confront them but got left on read no ?", "No, but it sounds like he did his venting while fairly easily overhearable, which isn't nice.   I prefer to avoid having people hear me when I'm venting about them.  It's just embarrassing to get caught talking behind someone's back.   The best thing is to square your shoulders, look them in the eye and say \"it's something I'm willing to say directly to your face.  Here it is.\"", "I personally wouldn\u2019t consider that a confrontation. OP got up and was walking around their apartment and then decided to text their roommate. They should\u2019ve walked in and said something in the moment, \u201chey, I get you guys are having fun, but I\u2019m not. I work long days and I\u2019m exhausted. Please tone it down.\u201d Then instead of talking to their roommate in person, they started talking shit while roommate was in the house and could overhear them. Part of college and living with other people is learning how to deal with conflict in a mature and effective way. This was neither.", "I think, if OP wants to have a positive relationship with their roommate then OP could say:\n\n \u201eHey, I think you overheard that. I do like you, but I also like my peace and I was just venting to my best friend. If you\u2019re happy with her then I am happy for you, but please try to be sensible as I live here too.\u201c"]}
