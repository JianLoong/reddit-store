I applaud you for wanting to provide for your disabled daughter, but I think that you need to see a lawyer about setting up a trust or some other mechanism to take care of your daughter.

It's his choice. You're not an asshole for that. \n\nBut I do think the way you're going about trying to ensure lifetime care for your daughter is risky as it relies on individuals saying they'll do it. They will at least partly be motivated by the money and some people may decide to do the very minimum (or worse) in terms of caring for your daughter. It's a very long commitment and even good intentions in the beginning may fail after 20 years. Your will needs to stipulate minimum conditions for the quality of her care as well as regular third party assessments and evaluations of her living situation. Someone independent needs to be nominated to carry those out or ensure they're done by a qualified third party. Abuse and neglect are unfortunately common - even when there's not a financial prize for the vulnerable person dying (I assume that her death releases the remaining estate to the caregiver). I'm not saying that your son or nephew would do that, they could be the nicest people in the world, I'm just saying that sort of thing has happened before. And your son or nephew could die and your daughter's care pass to someone who really doesn't care about her.\n\nPlease research better ways to plan for your daughter's future - you're not the first to deal with the situation and there will be knowledgeable people and organizations who can help. Start with groups who advocate for people with disabilities and your lawyer and go from there. \n\nNTA", "NTA because it\u2019s your money. The son is only entitled to it if they do something.

This can lead resentment. \n\nIf marge was a normal child , both the her and jack would have probably inherited the property equally, since marge is disabled her inheriting a large portion makes sense. But, depriving jack of his inheritance beacuse he refused to care for her is abuse of parenting. \n\nFor jack it might feel if there was a choice between him and marge , his parents would probably perfer marge over him thus believing that they love marge more than him. Instead of building relationships, their parents are basically trying to destroy it.", "The only love one of their children.

Even if there is a partner, the children still get a portion of that. This does not include stepchildren or foster children, which to me implies some would argue that the son is more entitled to the inheritance than the nephew is. He's kind of 'owed' the money through biology. It's literally what the word entitled means, to believe you INHERENTLY deserve something.\n\n\nYou're right about one thing though, he can just not take it as an option. If he did choose that, it'd be a shame he'd live knowing his parents who could have financially set him up for success and able to make his life as smooth & comfortable as possible with more opportunities with education/providing for his family etcc... But he didn't care enough to. My family don't have much, and I absolutely know my dad would and does do everything to make my life as easy/comfortable as possible. He'd worked extra shifts to help me pay for uni this year, I know I'm super lucky and I'm extremely grateful for him, and feel loved and that good stuff but he'll know his dad didn't want to do that for him when he so easily could.\n\nIt'll be after his dad's passing it really hurts him and will stop him from grieving properly.

Making sure all the money goes to ensure that she is taken care of for the rest of HER life is the most critical. No one can predict the economy in the future. Housing market crash? Inflation? Every single cent should go to her care/carer to give her/them the best care/lives they can get if the economy changes for the worse. And at some point, IT WILL. It always does.", "Exactly its parents.  Its not his inheritance but its not marge's either. Only reason marge got that inheritance is because she was disabled.  \n\nMoreover parents who painstakingly are thinking about marge are not thinking about jack. Is Jack not their child? Is Jack being punished?\n\nThink about this when jack's parents were alive his needs were secondary to marge's but even at their deaths they choose marge's needs over his. \n\nI have worked with disabled children, their siblings 90% are pitiful or rebellious. Most of them are pitiful.  They get less attention growing up and they search for love in wrong places or get addicted. \n\nI am not blaming marge but the parents. The parenting needs to be equal. Yes ! If there was only money for marge, giving it her is valid but it should be in trust to jack not some random nephew , they could make it legally tight and give it under care of jack.

You would be safest with a contract/stipulation in your will. Or set up a trust for the care of your daughter. There's nowhere where your son would be able to \"clean out a trust\" but just leaving the money to them would be safer. Your unwillingness to state which country you are in seems to indicate that you know you screwed up the inheritance vs trust thing.

But we all know gifts with string attached aren't gifts at all are they? \n\nMy point isn't that they are AH only because of the will, but the way they are trying to force brother to dedicate his life to be responsible for sister, it just feels shitty, like they are trying to make it cleat to the son that sister is their priority even after death you know? I wonder if there is a past of parentification here."]}
