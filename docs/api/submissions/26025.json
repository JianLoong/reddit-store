I applaud you for wanting to provide for your disabled daughter, but I think that you need to see a lawyer about setting up a trust or some other mechanism to take care of your daughter.

It's his choice. You're not an asshole for that. \n\nBut I do think the way you're going about trying to ensure lifetime care for your daughter is risky as it relies on individuals saying they'll do it. They will at least partly be motivated by the money and some people may decide to do the very minimum (or worse) in terms of caring for your daughter. It's a very long commitment and even good intentions in the beginning may fail after 20 years. Your will needs to stipulate minimum conditions for the quality of her care as well as regular third party assessments and evaluations of her living situation. Someone independent needs to be nominated to carry those out or ensure they're done by a qualified third party. Abuse and neglect are unfortunately common - even when there's not a financial prize for the vulnerable person dying (I assume that her death releases the remaining estate to the caregiver). I'm not saying that your son or nephew would do that, they could be the nicest people in the world, I'm just saying that sort of thing has happened before. And your son or nephew could die and your daughter's care pass to someone who really doesn't care about her.\n\nPlease research better ways to plan for your daughter's future - you're not the first to deal with the situation and there will be knowledgeable people and organizations who can help. Start with groups who advocate for people with disabilities and your lawyer and go from there. \n\nNTA", "NTA because it\u2019s your money. The son is only entitled to it if they do something.

And by care I don't mean they had to literally care for her but she did have a home to live in, which she would have been pushed out of by her older son who was looking forward to getting it. She had some money for her personal expenses and her health care. Which, again her kids would have gladly taken and left her to die if there was no will in place.

He'd still be caring for her, but not being her primary caretaker & doing everything for her. She won't have the same care OP provided either way & it's a sucky situation no matter what.
