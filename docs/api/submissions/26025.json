It's his choice. You're not an asshole for that. \n\nBut I do think the way you're going about trying to ensure lifetime care for your daughter is risky as it relies on individuals saying they'll do it. They will at least partly be motivated by the money and some people may decide to do the very minimum (or worse) in terms of caring for your daughter. It's a very long commitment and even good intentions in the beginning may fail after 20 years. Your will needs to stipulate minimum conditions for the quality of her care as well as regular third party assessments and evaluations of her living situation. Someone independent needs to be nominated to carry those out or ensure they're done by a qualified third party. Abuse and neglect are unfortunately common - even when there's not a financial prize for the vulnerable person dying (I assume that her death releases the remaining estate to the caregiver). I'm not saying that your son or nephew would do that, they could be the nicest people in the world, I'm just saying that sort of thing has happened before. And your son or nephew could die and your daughter's care pass to someone who really doesn't care about her.\n\nPlease research better ways to plan for your daughter's future - you're not the first to deal with the situation and there will be knowledgeable people and organizations who can help. Start with groups who advocate for people with disabilities and your lawyer and go from there. \n\nNTA", "NTA because it\u2019s your money. The son is only entitled to it if they do something.

This is your problem to solve but your selfishness is obvious here.", "YTA for not making arrangements for yoir daughter for community housing and instead threatening to disinherit your son if he refuses to care for her.\n\nHere's a clue. Your son has no obligation to put his life aside for his sister's benefit. You're absolutely inappropriate to demand that. You're doing a disservice to both children.", "YTA, with that much money it could be split so both children benefit. Your daughter's share would fund her full time care. \nI'm sure he loves his sister but I'm sure you know he'd be giving up his entire life to be her caregiver. \n\nI don't know why parents don't want their children to grow up happy and free to follow their hearts. So much controlling!", "I understand that this is a challenging situation, and it's important to make the most of life. Look at my grandmother, who nearly reached 100, and my parents who are approaching their 70s. Alongside the support you have, consider finding a group of caregivers or nurses to assist with your daughter's care. Also, try not to strain your relationship with your son. Instead, strive to foster a bond between the two of them. It's not meant to be about exchanging money as a way to take care of each other.   \nAlso, I might imply here that perhaps your son is already having debts and you should talk with him about that now. In life.", "Talk to a lawyer in your country.  I'm sure there is some way to set up the money as an annuity to be paid out to her in monthly installments that will pay for someone to take care of her.  Leave a small amount to your son and family-- it will make it very difficult to contest the will in the US if you totally leave them out and that might be the same in your country as well. \n\nIf your son gives in to get his share of the estate what protections will you have in place that would make him actually follow through with the arrangement?  Could he simply agree, get his half of the money. then dump her in a cheap care home?>", "YTA. Whoever your estate planner is, they are incompetent. That or you\u2019re going DIY \u201cto save money.\u201d Any estate attorney worth their salt would know there\u2019s something called a Special Needs Trust you can arrange for your daughter.", "Are you okay with having no relationship with your son from here on out? Not to mention, he could contest the will, and while he may not win, it could create a hassle. It sounds like you treat your son poorly, and I imagine his whole life he was the back burner to his disabled sister.\n\n\nYTA, I\u2019d instantly cut contact with you if I were in your son\u2019s position. You\u2019ve made it clear you only care about him on a contingency.", "YWBTA if you do anything other than get yourself to a good estate planner and attorney to set up a system to provide care for your daughter that does rely on the either the goodwill or the \u2018promise\u2019 or the *longevity* of either your son or your nephew.", "YTA and this is a horrible idea. Set up a trust to care for your daughter since she can\u2019t care for herself. Expecting with your son or nephew to do this will only create problems in the future and there is zero guarantee either will provide the standard of care you expect.", "YTA, and especially YTA if you think your nephew wouldn\u2019t take advantage of the situation. All he has to do is tell you what you want to hear. You need to talk to someone who will have no financial stake in the situation. \n\nDo right by your daughter and set things up NOW so there is not a huge transition when you and your wife die. Set up what kind of care she will need and ensure she will be provided for financially without linking it to any gain for someone else.", "YTA. His sister is not his responsibility. It's your job to make arrangements, like a care home or supported living. My husband's sister is severely disabled and he has never been responsible for her. She is in a home and will be absolutely fine if she outlives her parents (it's a big if).", "YTA absolutely disgusting ahole", "YTA. What ah unbelievably horrible and unfair burden to place on your son. If you have as much money as you say, can\u2019t you arrange lifelong care for Marge? Why does this have to fall on your son? She isn\u2019t his daughter and he isn\u2019t responsible for her.\n\nYou\u2019re basically saying that to you, his worth is tied to whether he commits to something that most parents even have trouble dealing with. He probably lived his entire life thinking about her, family decisions revolving around her, and everyone always catering to her needs (and that\u2019s understandable). Now you\u2019re saying he can never, ever escape that? Let your son have his own life and set your daughter up for great care in your will/trust.", "YTA I don't know if your son is older or younger than your daughter, I hope he's older and not born just to be a caregiver. Anyway, your daughter is your responsibility, not your son's. It's your duty to find a way for her to be taken care of without forcing anyone. Also, what would you think of people who agree to take care of your daughter just to have a lot of money? Do you think they'll love her because they have been paid to?", "That is spiteful. I know it\u2019s important that your daughter is looked after but that is a massive obligation and to give all your money to looking after your daughter shows that your son is not a priority. You should split the money equally with her half going towards care costs.", "YTA.\n\nI feel for you and your daughter, OP.\n\nBut it is not your son\u2019s responsibility to take care for your daughter. Jack probably already came second his ENTIRE life.\n\nWhat you are doing is so unfair.

It just sucks for your son\u2026", "Yta you have so much money but can't leave *anything* for your son bc, ya know, he's your son, and you love him?  He's nothing if he doesn't become his sisters caretaker?  Hope nephew is willing to deal with any old age issues too bc your son would be right to tell you to F off if you ask for his help", "Yta why does your son only have value if he watches your other child?", "The way I'm looking at this is that it is absolutely fair for the parents to want to use as much extra resources as are needed to ensure their disabled daughter is protected. If the son takes care of sister then less money must be used. Otherwise, a lot of money must be used to buy trust and checks and balances on strangers. Do you have any suggestions for what kind of arrangement would work in this scenario? Because some of the pressure just seems to be the ground realities.", "Couldn't agree more. I am so sick of people thinking they can \"dump\" their disabled kid on one of their other children. And their logic is always \"Well, it's their sibling!!!\".", "its his money, he can do what he wants with it and put whatever terms to it he wants.", "I laughed cause OP says they can't be sure their son won't take off with the money and leave his sister without care..... But they think he WILL take care of her on his own if they just leave him an inheritance..... Makes no sense whatsoever.", "Also he could still choose to help her because she is his sister and for the money but grow to resent her over time because he is responsible for her etc.", "This should be higher. NTA", "Huge chance that they could argue she isn\u2019t fit for a trust and if it does get grabbed she will be homeless. Our laws are really complicated with trusts. We did this way due to legal advice and safety concerns for Marge.", "I can't believe there are people saying that OP isn't an ah. What's also odd is that OP said they can't set up a trust because they can't be sure their son will actually make sure she's cared for and won't just pocket the money..... But they do trust that he's physically care for their sister full time..... ?", "He can do anything he wants, put her in a home, hire a nurse and so on. As long as he is cared for", "Seriously, Leave the money in trust and provide enough for your daughter to continue to live in your home and have 24/7 care.\n\nYou can pay your nephew to manage the caregivers if your son doesn't want to be involved.", "That's what I am not understanding- OP is saying there is millions, so why not set-up an arrangement now so that they know the sister is taken care of instead of trying to force the son to take care of her?\n\nAnd if they nephew has the same condition, how is her going to be able to take care of another disabled person and himself?", "Doing that comes with a huge chance of abuse toward her, it is one of the backups. Having an human watching even if she goes into a home makes her much safety than a contact that we can\u2019t enforce since we are dead", "He doesn\u2019t have to give up his life. Unless he wants a huge inheritance. He\u2019s free to reject it. He\u2019s not entitled to it.", "He's not being forced.", "I don't agree that the son should \"get what's left\" as there's no real guarantee on how much care and expense the daughter might require in the future.  While the son is able bodied, the daughter isn't. Unfortunately for thr son inheritance isn't  a given and OP and his wife are obligated to care for the disabled daughter rather than give him extra cash.", "Make sure she is taken care of. Form putting her in a home, get a caregiver or he could do it himself if he wanted.", "No, he could put her in a home. She just needs to be taken care of, which means she has a place to sleep, her medication, proper care, and not being abised", "If the nephew has the same condition the daughter has, how is he going to be able to care for her and himself? If it is a degenerative condition, how long will he be able to care for her before he himself needs care?", "That\u2019s a backups, it just so much safer for her to have a physical person instead of a contract with a place.", "Yes there would be a lot left over, a couple million. It\u2019s so much safer to have someone physical able to step in them a contract with a home", "That doesn\u2019t mean his not an AH.

Doesn\u2019t make it right.", "The laws protects this here, the law doesn\u2019t protect trusts", "This makes absolutely no sense. You don't trust that your son will make sure your daughter is cared for....

So you can die guiltless by dumping the burden on him instead of researching homes, finding the right one, and getting her placed before you die so you know it's good.  Got it. Not only are YTA, you're also a shit parent to BOTH of your kids. You don't actually even care what happens to your daughter, you just don't want to have it make you possibly feel bad. Gross", "That sounds very reasonable - did you told him that? Or is it possible that he assumes, that you want him to quit his job to become a full time carer for his sister?", "How well you think he would care for her under these circumstances?", "There still will come a point where either she needs more care than he can give her or where he is no longer capable of taking care of her. \nYou need to prepare.\n\nSet up a trust fund or something that can be used for her care. Keep an eye out on homes. \nThis lowers the bar and the pressure on anyone taking on the role of her contact person/whatever to call it. \n\nBut you shouldn't use his inheritance as leverage.", "If you put her with a resentful caregiver who is stuck with her for the rest of their life abuse and neglect are not only possible but probable.  The power dynamic will mean there will be little accountability if he lashes out.  Even saints lose their tempers sometimes. Sometimes people stumble and become addicts.  I don't even understand how you'd think this would be good for either of them.\n\n With a trust you can have someone hired whose is trained in what to look for shortcomings and abuse to check on her regularly at a facility with trained professionals.", "I think \"forced\" is too strong of a word, but I don't think that offering the choice between being a full-time caretaker or being disinherited is a particularly fair one; the son is only given the tools to succeed in service of the sister here, even if he'd be getting a ton of money by doing so.", "If all you expect of him is paying for her to be in home, why can't you put that in the will? Something like \"the estate will pay for all of Daughters expenses at Blank facility\". Wouldn't you be more comfortable picking the place your daughter goes to, rather than leaving that on your son?", "Why is he against this exactly? I feel like it's fair. He doesn't have to change his life drastically to care for her on a day to day basis. He just needs to ensure she has continuing care via services. Do your kids have any sort of relationship?", "Think they meant conditions on the inheritance, not the same disability.", "The nephew has the same condition that to get the money he must care for the sister, not the same condition as the sister.", "Understandable. It would be better to go ahead and figure out which person is going to be her permanent carer now though rather than waiting. Having in the will that the carer will get the money to compensate them and cover her care is not an AH move", "Well, with that amount of money have you researched the steps it would take to start your own group home for your daughter?  Son and nephew could be involved. You are asking your son to give up his life for her. That\u2019s a massive ask.", "If it's a few million dollars then you could find money for your son irrespective of your daughter. Your son has most likely been forced to sacrifice all his life for his sister, using him as your back up plan for when you die will just make him feel unloved and uncared doe", "its not even the kids money. he would be lucky to get any of it. If he wants to choose no inheritance to be more free in his life thats his choice. The father is not an asshole for wanting his disabled daughter to be taken care of.", "doesnt make it right to feel like your fathers money is owed to you in any sort of way. the son is an asshole if he feels his dad \"owes\" him the money. If he doesnt want to take it thats always an option.", "OP, at this point you really need to state what country you're in to help us out a bit because your entire judgment seems to hinge on a very strange legal system where you can create a one-time inheritance dependent on your son not just abandoning your daughter, but cannot create a long-term trust without it being ripped to pieces. You also seem to believe that your son would behave in line with your wishes with an inheritance but not with a trust, which again, does not make much sense to us.", "Trust aren\u2019t really a thing here, they aren\u2019t protected.", "Yes, he would have to pay the money back in full and could serve jail time. The laws are really strong on that side. This is why we are going this way it\u2019s so much safter", "Most likely hire someone, there is enough money or put her in home himself. Having a physical person overlooking a home is much safer than a contract. \nThere is plenty of money to put her in home and he would still have a ton left over.", "Do you realize that many people don't get inheritances at all?", "The problem with that is it\u2019s common for homes to close suddenly, If I pick a place and it closes he doesn\u2019t have an obligation to put her in a new home. It creates a loophole, that hard to fix accordingly to the lawyers and can be argued even if we have a section for what happens if it closes.", "I don\u2019t know, I explained it very clearly.", "Yes, another commentor clarified my misunderstanding.", "Oh, okay. I though it would be unwise to ask another disabled person to be the caregiver, so I totally misunderstood.", "Me and my nephew just had a talk and we solved the issue, he\u2019s taking over. Going to switch the order of the will, now son doesn\u2019t have to chose.\n\nI\u2019m going to get off this site and get this figured out with my lawyers", "Then it sounds like that\u2019s definitely the way to go. (Making it an inheritance requirement.)\n\nI\u2019d pick not just who you feel would follow through, but who you feel would treat your daughter the best and make sure she has a good life. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s your son. \n\nAnd your NTA. You are ensuring your disabled daughter is cared for. That\u2019s a responsibility you accepted when you decided to become parents. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to leave something for your son, but at the end of the day he\u2019s not disabled and is able to take care of himself. So your obligation is towards your daughter.", "So you want to let him pick the facility instead of you and your wife?  Who do you think will be less penny-pinching?", "If you're fine with her going to a home, then why go through these extra steps? What's the difference between you choosing a good facility for her and putting it in the will that tour estate pays for her stay there, vs leaving that to your son? He'll probably pick something cheaper then you would. If he's resentful of you and her, it's doubtful he'd visit her often either way", "Sure, but that doesn't mean that presenting the choice to their son this way is a fair one.\n\nLike, I don't think the parents have to give him an inheritance. If they wanted to disinherit him for other reasons, those might be good ones. If they wanted to live luxuriously and wind up leaving little to their kids, go for it. But given the situation we have here, where they (presumably) care about their son, have the ability to give him an inheritance, and still decide on making him getting anything conditional on him taking a lifetime, full-time appointment as a caregiver for his sister, that's a shitty way to play that hand.", "Fair enough. I think you need to speak with your son one on one and explain all this. Tell him that you don't expect him to give up his life and physically care for his sister, but you need to make sure that she is okay when you're gone. If all you said what \"take care of your sister or we will give the money to your cousin\", I can see why he got upset. Your expectation weren't clear, and it may have been a bit insulting to him to say you'd give all your money to someone else if he didn't take care of her. Maybe he always assumed he'd be watching over her when you passed, but the wording made it seem like you couldn't trust him without holding the money over his head. That would be very hurtful. Speak with your son, explain your expectations, and explain that you love them both. Hopefully this was all a big misunderstanding", "Maybe talk to him about why he feels this is unfair and what his concerns are. Does he think he should just get all the inheritance and Marge get nothing? Does he think he will have to be involved faily with her care? Does he not feel he knows enough about Marge's needs to ensure they're met? Does he know how to find facilities, how to find good facilities, and how to ensure she isn't abused?", "Oops, didn't see that.", "I hope you read this before cutting out your son\n\nI think you need to speak with your son one on one and explain all this.
