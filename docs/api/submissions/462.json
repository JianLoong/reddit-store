She has struggled a lot with the transition of her kids having kids, as she only views her family as her husband and kids, and does not like \"having a grandmother role forced on her\" When my oldest was born I was naive and thought MIL would help out. I learned that the hard way. She didn't want to do family holidays and just wanted to be alone with her husband, stopped doing family vacations. Honestly I thought it was just because she doesn't like me, but she loves her son in law and isn't any more interested in their children.\n\nI will admit this hurt me and I set pretty harsh boundaries. One of the boundaries was that my husband could not accept gifts from MIL. She would always get him really nice birthday and Christmas gifts and get our kids cheap impersonal junk. MIL's gifts to him were always experiences or hobby related things as he grew up wealthy but does not make the kind of money he grew up with, and she feels he doesn't treat himself enough. Six years ago we told MIL that he would no longer be accepting these gifts as he is a husband and father first, and it isn't right.\n\nWell my husband has been struggling with some depression lately. One of his biggest things is he feels like he is just a husband and father and lost his identity. He feels he gives constantly and gets very little back. I hate seeing him like this, so I called MIL and asked if she wanted to resume giving him gifts and said I would no longer stand in the way.\n\nWell he had a birthday recently and MIL bought him something for his hobby (probably a $10,000-12,000 bike according to the internet) and gave him some gift cards so he could take a weekend away to his favorite trails. I could see how much it meant to him and felt I made the right decision, but my daughter blew up.\n\nShe said I was being unfair to her by allowing MIL to flaunt how selfish she is, and that he should stand strong and say there will be no gifts until she can buy gifts for the family. She said she was disappointed in my lack of a backbone and disappointed in her dad. I saw my husband's face fall and told him it was ok and I didn't regret my choice, but our daughter was cold the rest of the night. The last gift MIL gave her was a tiny makeup pallet she probably picked up in line.

I'm going to say your attitude about this seems to have affected your daughter who is acting terribly entitled and spoiled.", "Withholding judgement. I think this situation is too complex and multifaceted for the internet to help. MIL has put you in a difficult place where there are no right answers.

That's all you trying to force hubby to go along with it but you can see by your own words, it's causing depression for him.\n\nThis is actually interesting as usually it's the mother's who try to cut off the MIL and everyone here says hey, it's ok, you can do how you want. Well the same applies here. MIL has every right to not want to be the instant baby sitter. She has every right to buy whatever gift she chooses and and for whom.", "YTA\n\nYou're terrible for teaching your daughter to equate the price tag of a gift with love.

Why would you involve them like that? A simple we\u2019re not doing gifts with grandma anymore is plenty explanation but no your daughter is berating your husband! Her father!?! Wtf!

From the start forbidding your husband from getting gifts from his mother? Because he gives him better gifts than the kids? They aren't her kids. So what if you don't approve of her gift giving.

Blowing up at 13 because her dad got a gift. What a terrible attitude you've instilled in your child.   \n\n\nAnd then to give her the green light was selfish on your part too.

You're free to refuse all the gifts you want. But you have no right to refuse gifts on behalf of someone else. That is not your boundary. That is your control issue. \n\nYour husband for not standing up to her. And for thinking only elaborate, expensive gifts will allow him to expand his identity beyond husband and father.

If she\u2019s young, she only needed to know it was a present, not the cost that was her parents mistake. If she\u2019s an adult\u2026 well, she shouldn\u2019t have known anyhow. Bottom line; quit giving your kids TMI for them to get upset about things.", "YTA why did this happen in front of the children? You know she was going to do something excessive.", "Mil troll.", "[removed]", "ESH\n\nHonestly, it is an entirely crappy situation. MIL's refusal to accept the new generation of her family is really, really weird. I'd like to say it's her money. However, I don't get why she is spending such an astronomical amount on gifts. Something that valued $10k?! Maybe if it were a couple hundred I could be more understanding. On the other hand, it is her money.\n\nINFO: is it her money and her money alone? This is spent from joint accounts with FIL? Is FIL in the picture at all? What's his take? Is he as removed and distant as MIL?\n\nThis could heavily influence whether MIL might actually be TA as doing a two-faced thing in regards to telling FIL one thing and and doing another.\n\nAnyway, sadly, you ans your daughter are not entitled to tell anyone how to spend their money. You also have no place telling someone to not accept gifts. You can express how these actions make you feel. You csn explain how it may influence family dynamics between your children.\n\nYour husband should get therapy instead of a bike to better deal with his identity issue. Clearly, the transition between wealth class had a larger impact on him then either of you anticipated. Hopefully, this will also help him navigate the quagmire that is your current family dynamic with the ILs.\n\nAnyway, good luck. Maybe your hubby can alternate gift requests from MIL in the mean time to help balance things out for him emotionally until he gets a better grasp for his feelings? Like, he asks for things for his hobbies and personal interests on his BDay, but he asks for things he share and create memories with OP and his kids for Christmas or something??", "Ok but like my parents always got me the nice gifts, grandparents always got me something small or frivolous. Usually grandparents are not giving the bomb gifts because parents get mad when they do this.\n\nAlso have you ever told grandma some of the kids hobbies or what they may like?

She isn\u2019t singling anyone out. She just is a hands off grandparent. And you find this so offensive that you banned (yes this is not a boundary. To set a boundary someone must have crossed a line. Getting her son nice gifts *gasp* how dare she?!) your husband from receiving gifts from his mother. Then you clearly raised a child who doesn\u2019t understand that gifts are something given freely and are not required nor expected nor to be compared to what others get.

What on earth made you think it was the right thing to restrict someone from giving gifts in the first place or to think you should be able to stipulate what kind of gifts could be given?

I get that you somehow thought you were doing the right thing but you weren't and it's a shame that your daughter was apparently raised to think that was right also.

If she had given my dad gifts, I can\u2019t say that I would have given a shit. I\u2019m not sure why it feels like such an offense to you? It\u2019s not like she gives gifts to the other grandkids and singled yours out. She just doesn\u2019t do it well across the board for people who aren\u2019t her kids. Now if she gave your husband something that could have been used for the whole family (like the gift cards maybe) and HE chose to hoard it all for himself, I could see being angry at him as a kid/spouse.  I also question why the only solution to him feeling like he doesn\u2019t have an independent identity is high-priced material goods. Maybe it\u2019d be more understandable if you were buying her gifts and she wasn\u2019t reciprocating. But it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case.

The MIL is clearly manipulating the situation to make sure the grandkids know how little she cares, over and over again. That\u2019s cruel.

It\u2019s a tough situation. My first reaction here is that your daughter needs to learn some empathy. Her dad\u2019s having a tough time, and his mother gave him a gift she thought would allow him some fun experiences and help cheer him up. The fact that daughter immediately goes for your and his blood, in the path of her grandmother\u2019s, implied that you have talked about this in front of your daughter. So that\u2019s where you were in the wrong, I think, and makes this an ESH for me. MIL sounds truly awful but at this point no one is changing her or teaching her lessons. So if hubby accepts the gifts and it makes your home happier, no issues. Just stop trashing grandma to your kid.

Growing up, I ended up only seeing them maybe once a year from us moving away, but I grew resentful of my grandparents for not putting effort to have a relationship with me. I think it would have been worse if I saw my dad get thousands of dollars while I got treated as an aftermath. It still hurts cause I see them treat the younger grandkids so much better and I wonder why they couldn't have been like that for me.

Yeah, you lost me there. You can\u2019t dictate what a mom gives her kid but boundaries are good if reasonable. You were not being reasonable when you banned all gifts. Now your daughter doesn\u2019t understand reasonable boundaries either.

But they were always meant for us, like for me anything to do with baking, books, or crafts and I was happy as hell as a kid. My brother was harder to shop for because he was really opinionated so she just gave him twenty bucks, that's it. That was his gift and he was happy because he could get what he wanted without directly \"demanding\" for something too expensive for my grandma to get because he would save. If your mil is buying things that are in your kids interest, cheap or not, because as long as she knows what they like that's what matters. But she doesn't sound like it and she doesn't show any interest in learning, I suggest if it does become a sticking point for your kids that they don't visit or talk to her. But that does mean your husband is gonna have to make a choice, if he keeps getting gifts like that it does send a message to the kids. Whether or not you realize it they are gonna see how little they actually matter to their family. It may sound greedy but I know what it means to feel left out, my cousins would get invited to do things or gifted things that we by no means were entitled to and that my dad could have gotten for us if we really wanted but it did rub it in that we weren't thought about in the same way. And I get that your husband is depressed, I completely and totally empathize with that, but he is showing where his happiness comes from right in front of your kids and it doesn't involve them and it does involve someone who, I'm sure they've picked up on the fact by now, doesn't like them. I'm gonna refrain from judging because honestly I think this is too emotional to really judge, yes your husband deserves happiness, yes it was good of you to think of him, and yes your kids are gonna feel some type of way seeing that grandma is capable of actually giving good thoughtful gifts but they just weren't good enough for it.", "INFO: if your daughter was the one who received the lavish gifts from MIL, and not your husband, would you have banned her from giving gifts to your daughter? \n\n.\n\nAdditional INFO: if your husband gets willed inheritance from his mother but nothing for your daughter, would he also have been banned from receiving it?", "Soft YTA\n\nWas therapy recommended for your husband struggling with feelings of depression,  loss of identity,  and unbalanced giving without receiving?

I guess parents aren't technically obligated to want their kids to be happy and technically have a right to let themselves be spoiled while their kids don't have anywhere near the luxuries they do, but every other situation where a parent spoils themselves and is happy to see their kids with little is described as abuse.

An incident happened with my SIL where GMIL husband  passed suddenly (they were very close with husband he was basically bonus grandpa/dad) and GMIL reaction  to him passing  was to move on really fast and expect every in the family to move on and accept her new beau (grief makes ppl weird). Now keep in mind before this SIL,MIL,GMIL are super close and function as a unit but the rest of the family wanted more time mourn while Acknowledging this was how GMIL refuses to accept this. So anyways family rift ensues some stuff happens. But SIL bday rolls around and she had been going through some other personal things so when she gets an invite GMIL for a bday dinner she thinks it's her reaching out and accepts. Now keep in mind when it comes to gifts this family knows each other and big or small gifts have very personal meaning. Dinner happens but GMIL new beau was invited to join them (SIL has heart of gold so she takes this in stride) but when they hand her her gift  it's very clear that new beau picked it out and it was very impersonal  and SIL is heartbroken because the whole thing was a sham. See why OP put a stopl to the expensive gifts to husband because in some families gifts are a way to show affection and OP didnt want her kids to think grandma hates them but loves dad.

Per OP, husband has lost his sense of identity and only feels that he is a father and a husband. Playing devil's advocate here, but does he feel this way because of a change in dynamic of his relationship with his mother? Obviously we don't know anything outside of what was written in the post, but did cutting off gifts from his mother make him feel less than important? Or does this sound like a mid life crisis? \n\nA 10 grand gift does seem ridiculous in my opinion, and not a healthy way to deal with a possibly significant mental health issue. \n\nI think it's tough to rate this one. My grandparents moved out of state, 3000 miles away, when grandchildren were very very young because this was \"their retirement time\". As a kid I didn't know all the details, but did miss them greatly. But as an adult now and hearing from my parents about grandparents attitude towards involvement, I'm glad I didn't know. Now we still visited them once a year or every few years. We didn't get insane gifts, but we had the tradeoff of \"some\" quality time. I can understand someone wanting to enjoy their retirement and it's the MILs right to choose how to spend her time or money. But I would hate to be that granddaughter who knows all the details of grandmother's feelings towards her at that age. \n\nSo yes OP, YTA for not accordingly dealing with your husband's depression and just encouraging MILs insane gift giving that demonstrates her disdain for grandkids. It's your responsibility to raise your children to feel loved, encouraging your MIL spending choices does not help in this situation. Your daughter is 13 and I'd say her behavior is pretty typical for a teenager who feels left out, she is NTA. MIL is TA for the gifts and her general disposition. If she doesn't want to be present in their lives, that's fine, go low contact then.", "Well, it also goes the other way around: if my mom our mil think that my kids are not family, we are not family anymore. The last person who is at fault is the daughter who probably see her classmates and friends having somewhat healthy relationships to their grandparents.

However, if you want to have a relationship with certain people, you will have to make concessions. Like if you want to have a relationship with your son, the rest of his family will be involved. You can\u2019t reasonably expect him to have a separate relationship with you apart from his family, if he\u2019s a good father and husband. *That* is what reeks of entitlement \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but if my mother treated my future kids like this, I would be going low contact with her.

If it\u2019s truly depression and the gift is the only \u201csolution\u201d they\u2019ve tried, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s collecting dust within 2 weeks.", "Yeah, I absolutely agree with this.\n\nWhen I was ages 0-6, my paternal grandmother worked for a toy distributor and I got absolutely SPOILED with stuffed animals of all shapes and sizes. At 6, when my parents split up, that stopped. My grandmother had always hated my mom because my dad left his first wife for her, and now that I wasn\u2019t with my dad full-time, grandma didn\u2019t feel obligated to send me more than a few dollars in a card. As an adult, I can shrug that off. From ages 6-15 (when she passed)? It hurt that she apparently didn\u2019t care enough to continue at the very least, sending more personal gifts. I had already recognized that her \u201clove language\u201d was gift giving. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, my maternal grandmother was very tight with her money and would frequently purchase our gifts as children at the \u201cdime store\u201d (similar to what a dollar store now is). When I got to about 9/10 years old, my mom and aunt (mother to my 3 cousins) decided that they would take grandma shopping when it came to gift-buying to help her pick out more appropriate gifts for us as we were getting older. They didn\u2019t force her to spend more than she was comfortable with, they simply made suggestions to help her find things that were more fitting for preteens and teenagers.

But then they actually have a relationship with their grandchildren which OP\u2019s MIL does not, nor is she obligated to have one. \n\nOP\u2019s daughter\u2019s reaction was very selfish.

I can see some narcissistic traits in the MIL. She gifts her sons and daughters because they are an extension of her. They are her legacy, the continuity of her in the world (from a narcissistic point of view). The grandchildren aren't. Plus, she's jealous of the kids. She wanted to be the only but children and husbands and wives are seen as competition.\n\nOne of my grandmothers was like OP's MIL. She was jealous of us and she made my life hell. She was narcissistic, and even though his son was even worst than her (he's a narcissistic too), she couldn't cope with the fact he had children (even though he was never a father to us. He was physically, verbally and psychologically abusive with my mother and us). She would make up lies about me so he would hit me, that's how sh!!ty, she was. \n\nIn the end, my mother finally divorced him. I'm NC with him and I went to LC with my grandmother. I heard he would hit her but honestly, I was unable to feel sorry for her. She created the monster (his son, my father) and she was happy when we suffered the consequences, so, even though I forgave her in the end, I thought she had what she wished for us.\n\nI think, in her narcissistic mind, she was jealous he had a family besides her when she only had him. I don't know. These kind of people are sick and I don't want to understand what crosses their minds, but I don't think it is age-related. I think is about legacy and being the centre of the universe.\n\n\nP.S. I was able to forgive her (but I never forgot) because she was the only survivor of 9 daughters and sons.
