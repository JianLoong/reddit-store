My husband recently obtained his dream job of being a police officer. Where I am from you go to police College after being hired for 3 months, and his police force does an additional 2 months after. Both places this training occurs is about 3 hours away, so he lives there Monday to Friday evening, and comes home Friday night until Sunday morning. I work a stressful job and am and will remain  the breadwinner in my role, I recently found daycare for my son for my 9-5 job.  \n\nFrom Monday to Friday I am absolutely doing everything myself, I take care of our son, dog, home, everything alone since my husband doesn't live here. He is essentially only home Saturday the full day, and this is the only time I would get a break from running everything, or even just showering alone, poop alone etc. \n\nHere is the dilemma, he agreed when he comes on the weekends I would get a break as his evenings at school are his to workout, relax, do homework whatever. On this upcoming Saturday, he booked a tee time as a rain check from a previous golf time earlier in the summer. The money already was paid and He booked a Tee time with his brother for the Saturday morning. It's about an hour drive from our house to the golf course (2 hour round trip) and 18 holes can take them anywhere from 4-5.5 hours depending on speed of play. I tried to say it's not fair he uses the only day he is home to be essentially gone most of the day to golf. He said he wants time for himself too, but when I suggested play 9 instead he flat out said no And that he booked it and he was just telling me what he was doing Saturday. \n\nSo aita for making this a big deal and being really upset? I just feel like I do everything to hold down our home and family and he doesn't care and even when he has the opportunity to come home, spend time with us, and lighten the load a bit and be a family, he chooses a stupid game over us...\n\nEdit: he thinks I'm the asshole because he doesn't see that he wants time to himself too to unwind from his week, but from my perspective, he gets that by living away, not having go worry about any house responsibilities,cooking etc. His whole week is just focusing on school and himself", "created_utc": 1696629968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171p8k6/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_golf_on_the/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has just shown you how he feels about you and your & his child. Believe him. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA but your husband is showing a lot of red flags. Why isn't he desperate to spend time with you every week after so much time away? I've had to work out of the house for several days at a time and all I wanna do when I get done is go home and be with my husband. \n\nAnother red flag. Being a cop is his dream job? I hope you're aware, for your own safety, the high percentage of these men known to physically abuse their wives. He's already abusing you through neglect. Honestly you and your child might be safer without him in the house.", "It\u2019s a red flag to me that a husband would come home after being away from his wife and baby for a week and need to be away from them to \u201cunwind\u201d. Being with your family should be the priority", "NTA. He's being incredibly neglectful of you. He's living his dream, and you're stuck with all of the hard work.\n\nBe very, VERY careful. Domestic violence rates amongst police officers are VERY high. He's already showing a willingness to neglect you and dismiss you, and as he spends more time around other police officers, they may start to rub off on him and that disregard may slowly turn to something worse. The longer he spends mired in violence and prejudice, being taught to live in a constant state of being on-edge and fearful, and being deprived of any meaningful education in how to actually handle the situations he's thrust into, the more reactive he may become. Be vigilant for signs that he's becoming touchy or aggressive. Because when he's at home, *you and your child* will become the nearest targets for whatever damage to his mind and character he sustains at work. It's not a guarantee but it IS a trend, and one he is vulnerable to because he's ALREADY neglectful.\n\nI sincerely hope it won't come to this, but make sure you have resources in place to escape if you need to. This means resources that are *outside* the area where he works, because it's very difficult to escape a police officer-- they can muster a lot of support to their side due to how intensely police officers protect their own.\n\nThis may not happen for months, or even years. Radicalization is a gradual process, and the radicalization of law enforcement is no exception. But it may yet happen.", "You are essentially working 24 hrs 5 or 6 days a week. The average 1 yr old is still waking up during the night and needing comfort and nursing/bottles. And preparing everything for your son every day and then being \"on\" and present when you get home is exhausting. \n\nYour husband works 9-5, 5 days a week. When he gets home during the week, he has no child to care for, prep for, and cater to. He can relax every evening. \n\nAnd now he wants to not even contribute on the weekends? \n\nThat is....bullshit. \n\n\n\nNTA. \n\n\nIn true reddit fashion, you could collect child support and hire a babysitter for a few hours to get some time to catch up on your needs. \n\n\nIf it's short-lived, and he finds a way to give you the same amount of time, then it's fair. But I don't know how he would find a way to give you that. Maybe he can take the kid golfing with him. \ud83d\ude04", "NTA\n\nSchedule something for next Saturday, inform him and leave.\n\nAlso, he needs to appreciate that you are not his housekeeper.

You aren\u2019t the AH for being upset that he is going to have plans on the Saturday when it should be your \u201cfree\u201d day. I don\u2019t think that he is the AH as it wasn\u2019t a new golf day. It was a rain date due to a previously canceled & already paid for golf trip.", "NAH. You need some respite and so does he. I don't know what your line of work is, but enforcement is a regimented and stressful job. It's physical, you see stuff you cannot talk about (even while in training), and sometimes it's hard to unwind.\n\nIt's clear yous need to talk and find a compromise - however, it sounds to me like you are looking at the whole thing with rose-tinted glasses. Are you so sure that, if he were living with you, seeing all that bad stuff would have no impact on him and he could just be a husband and a father at home? I hope you find the time to have an open and honest conversation. Go in it from a place of curiosity, not judgment/hurt.", "Nah - am I understanding that it\u2019s a one time thing? He should have handled it better but a one time going out is different than him wanting to spend every Saturday out.", "Soft Yta.  This is a stressful time for both of you.  If he was golfing every weekend, I\u2019d agree with you.  But golfing one saturday isn\u2019t unreasonable imo.  He\u2019s not on vacation while he\u2019s away, he\u2019s working too in a sense.  plus he has a long drive each way.

He gets downtime after his training M-F evenings. You don't. You don't have an ebb and flow, you have atmospheric river levels of flow. \n\nHe's going to use the same excuse when he's a cop. This doesn't get better unless you put a stop to it now. He doesn't get to fuck off and leave you holding the bag, this is 50% his fucking kid, too. \n\nAnd for what it's worth, my husband sometimes goes away for work and when he comes back he's excited to see his kids and spend time with them.

He has children he needs to be at home taking care of.", "I'm in child protection, so I definitely understand that aspect of stress and seeing/hearing traumatic things. But, I also was very upfront with him that he needs to find a productive way to talk about that trauma, and if it's not me, it should be someone professional or a friend or whomever that he can talk to. I've been very upfront that he needs to find a way to process that doesn't destroy him", "Are u saying that because he is a cop you shouldn't expect him to be a good husband/partner/father because he see bad stuff?

Everyone is making this poor guy out to be the villan. Somebody basically said that he was going to start abusing her. Like I said in a previous reply, it sounds like he just wanted 1 day. 1 day to go golfing that was already paid for. 1 day out of 5 months?

Is it possible that this training is more stressful than you realize? Maybe he wants to talk to\nhis brother about it. Once he becomes a cop his life will be on the line every day. Especially the way things are now.

Both of you are individuals, he has his hobbies and you should have yours as well.", "NTA. \n\nFor 5 months he lives away M-F and presumably trains all day with time off each day to enjoy with whatever he wants to do. \n\nFor those same months you are working full time and taking on his parenting and household responsibilities in addition to what was already yours for that same 5 months. \n\nHe can give up his weekends for do whatever he wants to take on parenting and household duties in an amount to make it up to you the best he can for the double time you\u2019re doing on his behalf. \n\nWhen my husband leaves town for a few days, he comes home and catches up on chores, parenting and cooks the next few meals. Because he knows that when he leaves I\u2019m doing extra, so he steps up and does extra for a few days", "Is this something he does everyweekend? Or is it 1 saturday for half the day? I am not knocking how hard it is to take care of everything from monday to friday, but it sounds like he gives you a whole day", "NTA. What\u2019s the point of being married if your partner doesn\u2019t contribute a damn thing? You don\u2019t need his money and you don\u2019t have his support or his understanding. You would be better off as a single parent; you pretty much are one anyway, but if you get a divorce you won\u2019t have to be disappointed every day of your life with a partner who drags you down.", "NTA. \nI was in a similar situation (absent during the week). The one thing my wife wanted on Sat/Sun was a lie in. That\u2019s what she got, for as long as she wanted. \nSomeone told me just before we had our child that the real \u201cvalue add\u201d of a father is to find the things that your partners really needs you to do when you have a new born and just own them. It can be a foot massage, sleep, doing the laundry or shopping or cleaning, whatever. Just do it and everyone\u2019s lives will be better. \nMy wife felt (half) human again after getting to sleep for 12+ hours uninterrupted sleep two days a week, so I never arranged anything at weekends for the first months. That ought to be the sacrifice a father is willing to make.", "Are we talking about just one Saturday that is already paid for?", "NTA - He has every single evening of the week to himself to do whatever he pleases. You do everything (working a full time job that supports the family, doing 100% of the childcare, and taking care of the house) completely on your own all week. Saturday is the only day you could possibly have any time to yourself or any time with him, and the only day that he spends with your child. He is a major AH to think that this is ok. I guess he just expects you to work yourself to death to provide everything for everyone while he does whatever he wants. Please show him this post and all the comments. It *MIGHT* get the message through his thick skull to see that everyone agrees with you, but, unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t recommend holding your breath.", "YTA, It is one day. Let the man have some fun", "People need to understand that having children means you give up the perks of not having children\u2026 NTA", "NTA. You are sacrificing so much to take care of the house, child, and dog, from Sunday night to Friday night. All while holding a FT job. You are a super mom.\n\n The least he can do is sacrifice ONE day of his week to give you a break. He's free to hang out with his friends everyday after school.  He has zero obligations. Studying and free evenings. Honestly, you'd think he'd want to soak up every single second he has with his child after being away for so long. I understand if he never sees his friends, and wants to socialize for a little bit for mental health, I think it's totally fair to opt for a shorter 9hole game maybe once a month. Definitely not a whole day scenario where he comes back only for dinner or afterwards. I think the 9hole game is a reasonable sacrifice he can make. \n\nGoodluck OP, I don't think I would go surprise revenge spa route next weekend and dump baby on him. I feel the way he's acting right now, would escalate things very quickly. Perhaps there's counseling you can reach out to to help mediate this stressful time?", "NTA \n\nbut\n\nYou chose to marry a man whose goal is to be a c o p and are shocked he's prioritizing himself over you and your family? \n\nY i k e s", "No sex for him. No warm, loving wife for him. No laundry for him. No home cooked meals for him. No listening to him prattle on about big boy gun school with his pals. He could go hit golf balls every day after work. \nWhatever. He gets all the consideration and courtesy he\u2019s giving out. He does not value nor respect your contributions to his life. \n\nI\u2019d be gone with child every this weekend. You need a break. Since he can\u2019t spare any time, you make other plans too.\n\nSay nothing. I\u2019d make plans to be a single parent starting tomorrow. \nWhat a selfish asshole. \n\nI hope the dog is yours, not his. Because otherwise he needs to find someone else to dog sit Rover like his brother or parents. \n\nI\u2019d this is how he is early on, can you imagine what 10,20,30 years would be like? Misery. \n\nGet the child support and day care figured out now - it\u2019s not going to get better. He\u2019ll work nights and weekends, have your child in daycare on his off days, and have 2-3 weekdays off while you are on duty every weekend after working all week.", "NTA.

This will also be hard on the family unit, especially if he doesn't do his share.", "WTAF \ud83d\ude02 it's not like playing golf every weekend, it's a one off that he's only doing because it's paid for and was cancelled. The man isn't on holidays throughout the week either, he's working too and normally giving up his weekend to help his wife every other time. It's crazy you make such wild claims that he's \"just a house guest expecting sex\" and that she should leave him if it continues.", "Likely not, he'll just claim work is keeping him too busy.", "Book something! If you don\u2019t treat yourself to something be it spa day or lunch with friends or just a few hours to decompress you will become more angry at your spouse. I have been in your shoes and it hurts A LOT that he\u2019s choosing \u201cme time\u201d over family time.If you can live with him playing 18 holes of golf then he will learn to accept that you need \u201cme time\u201d too. You are feeling unappreciated for the load you are carrying right now because he is not showing appreciation. Hopefully when the class is over and you resume your married life the load will be more evenly shared. You\u2019re doing the best you can and it\u2019s his loss that he\u2019s missing out on some awesome family time. If you feel that things are not getting better even after the class is over, please see a marriage counselor. You both owe it to yourselves to work through this. Good luck!", "Sounds like he is doing that all the other weekends.", "Do this!!!!", "Hope OP sees this", "I came here to make this same comment.", "I am so mad I can\u2019t give you a huge award for this. Please OP please take this to heart", "Where did you read she gets 8 full days a month for herself? He's only home for a full day on Saturday and she states that's the only time she's not running everything alone. She's not even taking those days as breaks, she just isn't solely responsible for everything. He is gone 6 days a week and they have a 1 year old child.\n\nETA if you're talking about their agreement that she gets a break for a few hours on a Saturday when he's home, that is hardly 8 full days a month. She literally is doing absolutely everything 24 hours a day for 26 days of the month. He has every single night to fuck off and do what he wants while she's making all of the income and solely taking care of their baby.", "Most people poop at home if they can.  There are many that will hang on until they get home to avoid pooping at work.\n\nWhen the OP is home... she has a one year old that wants to join her in the toilet... obviously her pooping happens when the 1 year old is awake..  Kids always know when you need to do something that really doesn't require them there but they really want to join you anyway... like pooping, or showering, or eating, or on the phone!", "He can take up a hobby to do after work m-f or after he moves back home.", "Why can\u2019t he wait until his short 5 month obligation to work is over to reschedule his Saturday golfing trip? He is literally making her work a full time job, take care of the home full time, AND a one year baby. What the heck", "He isn\u2019t the provider. She makes more and will continue to make more. And he clearly isn\u2019t taking care of her either.

She needs downtime, but has none during the week, and he isn't giving her any on the weekends while he's home.  Just because she's a women does not mean she should be raising her kids alone, while also working a full time job.  He's only working 40 hours a week.  She's working 112.", "Even a one off day of golfing is a massive dick move when it\u2019s the ONLY day his wife has a chance at a semblance of a break. He\u2019s absolutely getting a break during the week compared to her because he isn\u2019t responsible for any of the domestic labor or care of their child AT ALL. Also, I have a hard time believing that a rain check tee time could only be used on this particular Saturday and not at a time after he completes his training."]}
