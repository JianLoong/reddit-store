My husband recently obtained his dream job of being a police officer. Where I am from you go to police College after being hired for 3 months, and his police force does an additional 2 months after. Both places this training occurs is about 3 hours away, so he lives there Monday to Friday evening, and comes home Friday night until Sunday morning. I work a stressful job and am and will remain  the breadwinner in my role, I recently found daycare for my son for my 9-5 job.  \n\nFrom Monday to Friday I am absolutely doing everything myself, I take care of our son, dog, home, everything alone since my husband doesn't live here. He is essentially only home Saturday the full day, and this is the only time I would get a break from running everything, or even just showering alone, poop alone etc. \n\nHere is the dilemma, he agreed when he comes on the weekends I would get a break as his evenings at school are his to workout, relax, do homework whatever. On this upcoming Saturday, he booked a tee time as a rain check from a previous golf time earlier in the summer. The money already was paid and He booked a Tee time with his brother for the Saturday morning. It's about an hour drive from our house to the golf course (2 hour round trip) and 18 holes can take them anywhere from 4-5.5 hours depending on speed of play. I tried to say it's not fair he uses the only day he is home to be essentially gone most of the day to golf. He said he wants time for himself too, but when I suggested play 9 instead he flat out said no And that he booked it and he was just telling me what he was doing Saturday. \n\nSo aita for making this a big deal and being really upset? I just feel like I do everything to hold down our home and family and he doesn't care and even when he has the opportunity to come home, spend time with us, and lighten the load a bit and be a family, he chooses a stupid game over us...\n\nEdit: he thinks I'm the asshole because he doesn't see that he wants time to himself too to unwind from his week, but from my perspective, he gets that by living away, not having go worry about any house responsibilities,cooking etc. His whole week is just focusing on school and himself", "created_utc": 1696629968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171p8k6/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_golf_on_the/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he's only doing this for 5 months then he should spend EVERY Saturday giving you a break and/or spending time with his family unit (you and your son). He could have waited until he was done with training camp to golf. If he's planning for a long term situation leave him now. As an aside 5 total months to be a cop? That's definitely not enough for the responsibility of the job...", "NTA - While I can see that he has a full schedule, his lack of concern in the response for you and your child is disturbing. What does he provide to the relationship that makes it worthwhile to you? Once he is done with police school, do you think he will pick up the slack?", "Okay. Was this a one-time golf game? Because\u2026 while you\u2019re right and NTA because you\u2019re doing an unfair amount of work, AND his response was demeaning, nasty and immature. However, if this was a one-time game, yeah, you were a bit over the top. \n\nHe\u2019s acting like a jerk and is no doubt chauvinistc \u2014 you do have a problem there. But maybe you\u2019re choosing to die on the wrong hill. I was raised in a home with a \u2018dad who golfed\u2019. All hail Golf\u2014except he was the only one who did. They fought about golf, almost divorced about golf, he once forgot his newborn  child, and left him alone to go play golf\u2026 my point is that golf, while a pain in the butt, isn\u2019t your problem. You have a husband problem, because he isn\u2019t hearing you or treating your concerns with respect. Marriage counseling?", "NTA. So next weekend book a spa day, tell him what you're doing and swan out leaving him literally holding the baby.", "NTA \n\n>he agreed when he comes on the weekends I would get a break", "NTA\n\nTell him to take the kids with him. Get up in the morning and leave. Let him spend the time trying to sort child care out. He has left all that on your shoulders, let him have a taste of it.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to be contributing to household chores and childcare in an equal manner as you.\n\nHe already agreed weekends are for you, because he gets time at night during the week that's for him. \n\nThis is not a good look only 2 years in.", "NTA. I would be livid. You are carrying the load of everyone and you deserve a break on the only day of the week you can get it. He\u2019s trying to live like it\u2019s the 1950s but doing it on your paycheck?? Oh heck no. He can\u2019t have it all. That\u2019s just now how a marriage works.", "NTA\nYour partner agreed this would be your free time and has gone back on that. I get that he wants free time but he seems to not realise that you're bearing the brunt of his choice to go away and study and that his week time is basically his free time. He really should be making up for that. At the very least, he should have agreed to 9 holes instead of 18 but I still think it was a bit of a jerk thing to do anyway", "NTA\n\nYou're on your own working a full-time job and taking care of a 1-yr-old.  Not being able to poop alone is a real thing and it gets taxing when you've no support or help.  You're not asking for a spa weekend, just for his presence.  Which his toddler is not getting and his brother has gotten tons of over the years.  \n\nHusband needs to step up.  He's home one day a week.  That's when he's on as Dad, Husband, maintenance guy, etc for you.  The rest of the week he's his own person.  It's 5 months... he waited this long to use his rain check, he can wait a little more until he's back home and things are more steady.  Or as steady as they get when you're married to a cop doing shift work.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He has just shown you how he feels about you and your & his child. Believe him. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA but your husband is showing a lot of red flags. Why isn't he desperate to spend time with you every week after so much time away? I've had to work out of the house for several days at a time and all I wanna do when I get done is go home and be with my husband. \n\nAnother red flag. Being a cop is his dream job? I hope you're aware, for your own safety, the high percentage of these men known to physically abuse their wives. He's already abusing you through neglect. Honestly you and your child might be safer without him in the house.", "It\u2019s a red flag to me that a husband would come home after being away from his wife and baby for a week and need to be away from them to \u201cunwind\u201d. Being with your family should be the priority", "NTA. He's being incredibly neglectful of you. He's living his dream, and you're stuck with all of the hard work.\n\nBe very, VERY careful. Domestic violence rates amongst police officers are VERY high. He's already showing a willingness to neglect you and dismiss you, and as he spends more time around other police officers, they may start to rub off on him and that disregard may slowly turn to something worse. The longer he spends mired in violence and prejudice, being taught to live in a constant state of being on-edge and fearful, and being deprived of any meaningful education in how to actually handle the situations he's thrust into, the more reactive he may become. Be vigilant for signs that he's becoming touchy or aggressive. Because when he's at home, *you and your child* will become the nearest targets for whatever damage to his mind and character he sustains at work. It's not a guarantee but it IS a trend, and one he is vulnerable to because he's ALREADY neglectful.\n\nI sincerely hope it won't come to this, but make sure you have resources in place to escape if you need to. This means resources that are *outside* the area where he works, because it's very difficult to escape a police officer-- they can muster a lot of support to their side due to how intensely police officers protect their own.\n\nThis may not happen for months, or even years. Radicalization is a gradual process, and the radicalization of law enforcement is no exception. But it may yet happen.", "You are essentially working 24 hrs 5 or 6 days a week. The average 1 yr old is still waking up during the night and needing comfort and nursing/bottles. And preparing everything for your son every day and then being \"on\" and present when you get home is exhausting. \n\nYour husband works 9-5, 5 days a week. When he gets home during the week, he has no child to care for, prep for, and cater to. He can relax every evening. \n\nAnd now he wants to not even contribute on the weekends? \n\nThat is....bullshit. \n\n\n\nNTA. \n\n\nIn true reddit fashion, you could collect child support and hire a babysitter for a few hours to get some time to catch up on your needs. \n\n\nIf it's short-lived, and he finds a way to give you the same amount of time, then it's fair. But I don't know how he would find a way to give you that. Maybe he can take the kid golfing with him. \ud83d\ude04", "NTA\n\nSchedule something for next Saturday, inform him and leave.\n\nAlso, he needs to appreciate that you are not his housekeeper. You are a human being that needs some freedom as well.", "Why doesn\u2019t he just take his child along to golf?", "[deleted]", "NAH. You aren\u2019t the AH for being upset that he is going to have plans on the Saturday when it should be your \u201cfree\u201d day. I don\u2019t think that he is the AH as it wasn\u2019t a new golf day. It was a rain date due to a previously canceled & already paid for golf trip.", "NAH. You need some respite and so does he. I don't know what your line of work is, but enforcement is a regimented and stressful job. It's physical, you see stuff you cannot talk about (even while in training), and sometimes it's hard to unwind.\n\nIt's clear yous need to talk and find a compromise - however, it sounds to me like you are looking at the whole thing with rose-tinted glasses. Are you so sure that, if he were living with you, seeing all that bad stuff would have no impact on him and he could just be a husband and a father at home? I hope you find the time to have an open and honest conversation. Go in it from a place of curiosity, not judgment/hurt.", "Nah - am I understanding that it\u2019s a one time thing? He should have handled it better but a one time going out is different than him wanting to spend every Saturday out.", "Soft Yta.  This is a stressful time for both of you.  If he was golfing every weekend, I\u2019d agree with you.  But golfing one saturday isn\u2019t unreasonable imo.  He\u2019s not on vacation while he\u2019s away, he\u2019s working too in a sense.  plus he has a long drive each way.  If you can swing it, hire a cleaner and/or a sitter to help lighten your load.", "ESH.", "Wow. He's being incredibly selfish. You work two jobs, your employment and your parenting. He has one job. He gets downtime after his training M-F evenings. You don't. You don't have an ebb and flow, you have atmospheric river levels of flow. \n\nHe's going to use the same excuse when he's a cop. This doesn't get better unless you put a stop to it now. He doesn't get to fuck off and leave you holding the bag, this is 50% his fucking kid, too. \n\nAnd for what it's worth, my husband sometimes goes away for work and when he comes back he's excited to see his kids and spend time with them. That's the norm. That's the standard. \nNTA", "NTA. So his only contribution to the relationship is his one sperm! Get rid of him", "NTA.  This is only for 5 months and you have a small child.  He can forgo golfing 18 holes for a few months.  If he wants 18 holes, he better find someone to give you a much needed break.", "NTA Wake up early Saturday morning and get your day on.", "40% of police officers are abusive to their spouse. Good luck with that.", "Someone poops with you at work??!!", "He wants time to himself eh what about you??", "This, exactly.", "Honestly, I think the counseling piece Is what we need, and his benefits are stellar in that regard that he has access to unlimited counseling (due to the trauma likely). Thank you for this perspective, it's just so maddening he doesn't see how golf shouldn't trump being home with your family to help! I love winter because of the lack of ability to golf :)", "baby might not survive the day lol", "Well our chequing account (and him) say he went out for dinner and drinks for a buddies birthday, and he works out and hangs out with his friends there most evenings since  class ends at 445. It's definitely work, I know that, but he does have down time every night. I wish I had something similar haha", "His circumstances have changed. He has children he needs to be at home taking care of.", "I'm in child protection, so I definitely understand that aspect of stress and seeing/hearing traumatic things. But, I also was very upfront with him that he needs to find a productive way to talk about that trauma, and if it's not me, it should be someone professional or a friend or whomever that he can talk to. I've been very upfront that he needs to find a way to process that doesn't destroy him", "Are u saying that because he is a cop you shouldn't expect him to be a good husband/partner/father because he see bad stuff? That doing so is \"wearing rose colored glasses\" umm so what would be your advice be? Give up now because your options are to divorce him or suck it up cause he can't be a loving, caring partner? I'm confused", "Not spending time with his son during the ONE day he is available is unreasonable. She's a single parent for 6 days a week for 5 months, but he thinks his golf should outrank keeping his end of the deal.\n\nShe's also working FULL TIME and doesn't get every evening off like he does.  In her evening, she's taking care of the baby and the dog.  In his evening time, he ISN'T taking care of a baby and dog.", "This is such a bad take. She is the primary breadwinner, primary caretaker for THEIR son, and primary caretaker of the house. It sounds like she's doing all the work to support his dream - and he can't even support her for one day a week.\n\nAnd in the end, she even asked for a compromise - for him to play a shorter round of golf. And he said no! He is absolutely TA, and she is absolutely NTA.", "Oh hell no. He can wait to golf when he's not away for 5 months. He's mostly chilling eith the boys per her post and comments so he basically is at a summer camp.", "So she should parent solo the entire week and then also on Saturday? He has evenings off, she doesn't.", "The fact that you work CP and a future cop doesn't recognize that you need down time is alarming. Is he one of those people who thinks their job is the most important thing ever. Cause that's not a rare outlook for a cop to have.", "Amen"]}
