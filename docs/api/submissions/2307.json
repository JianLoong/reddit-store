We both work two jobs and we don\u2019t have a lot of time together but when we do, we try to make the most of it. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s brother, let\u2019s call him Dave, has been living in my bf\u2019s house for a year. Dave has a very bad heart because he used to be a heavy smoker and he is a binge eater. He\u2019s had a heart attack twice in the past two years so he had to retire early. At first, Dave would help out with the dishes a little, but over time he stopped doing chores. \n\nHe buys a ton of food and there\u2019s barely any room in the fridge. When I come over he\u2019s always watching TV in the living room so my boyfriend and I have to go in his room to watch TV. He cooks food and doesn\u2019t clean up after himself so my boyfriend and I are the ones who have to clean up after him. \n\nWhen I talk to my boyfriend about it, he is sick of it too but he says \u201cwell, he\u2019s my brother..\u201d I moved in a month ago and Dave is not happy about that. I was starting to get fed up and I suggested that Dave should pay 650 dollars a month in rent as he has enough money. Dave was very angry. Over the past year, Dave has paid my boyfriend 300 dollars. The final straw for me was when my boyfriend\u2019s family came over to celebrate my bf\u2019s birthday. Whenever I talked, Dave would talk over me. Their family bought a bunch of food and we all cooked, Dave didn\u2019t clean or help out. Their mom said I could have some left over pizza that was in the fridge. Dave ate it while I was sleeping.\n\nThis morning I packed up my stuff and told my boyfriend that I moved out and I won\u2019t move back in until Dave leaves. My bf is divided because he hates confrontation and Dave is his brother. AITA for this? It feels like i\u2019m going to divide him from his brother if I give an ultimatum.", "created_utc": 1668439831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yv2rvp/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_bfs_house_because_his/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Send him back to mommy, he's not done being raised yet.", "Holy shit.  You are NTA in any way, shape, or form.\n\nDave is freeloading off his brother, and (by extension) you as well.  He pays no rent, he does no chores, and he's big mad that you moved in?\n\nYour boyfriend isn't dating you - he's dating his brother.\n\nThis is what your future is going to look like.

However, I think you should also be prepared to say goodbye to that relationship if your bf chooses not to get rid of his brother.", "NTA.  If \u201cbut Dave is my brother\u201d means Dave gets to do whatever Dave wants with zero regard for how that impacts you, then your boyfriend and Dave don\u2019t need you getting in the way.  If your boyfriend actually wants to continue living with you, never mind making you feel like an actual partner and future member of the family, then he needs to hold Dave to at least the same standards as any other roommate: he needs to contribute to the household, he needs to not hog the common areas, he needs to respect other people\u2019s stuff and ask permission before just taking food that isn\u2019t his\u2026and if he can\u2019t or won\u2019t do all that, or even if he does but the two of you decide you want your own space as a couple, then he needs to figure out other accommodations like the adult he allegedly is.", "NTA, but if sick brother can\u2019t live on his own, I\u2019m not sure that your boyfriend will ever confront him. I think it\u2019s good that you\u2019re getting some space because you can\u2019t live like that. I\u2019m not encouraging you to end or not end this relationship but understand that you\u2019ll be dealing with the brother in some capacity if you stay dating him.

What a crappy situation.  Perhaps his brother could move into some housing for people with disabilities.  If BF wants to live his brother, then that is the life that he is choosing.", "NTA. Your BF needs to set some rules for his brother.  He's going down the same path that caused his health problems. They are going to get worse because he's not making any changes.

He is showing where his priorities lie. You don't want to live there if it means you have to put up with his brother's behavior. Neither of you is willing to compromise for the sake of the relationship - and that is ok! Sometimes even when two people are right for each other, relationships don't work out. \n\nFor what its worth - I would not want to live in that situation either.

We both work two jobs and we don\u2019t have a lot of time together but when we do, we try to make the most of it. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s brother, let\u2019s call him Dave, has been living in Johnny\u2019s house for a year.

So you are both working 2jobs,and Dave has money but doesn't pay? I guess a lot of the other stuff might be explained away with mental health problems (but in this case he should get help and work on it), but that's one of the two that aren't.\nAnd then there is him being unfriendly to you (I assume you were friendly). The 'watching TV in the living room' could be him trying to get company. All in all I would say you guys should really start to comunicate. Each of you making lists of what you want, and what you are able and willing to give. And then see if you can work out something.", "NTA. But I also feel a bit bad for your BF since he clearly is caught between a rock and a hard place. \n\nYou haven't been with your BF long, and if you are already giving him an ultimatum, it's a sign that he is likely not ready to make the commitment to the relationship that you are willing to. \n\nDave isn't your burden, and his health issues don't give him the right to demand that his family bend over backward to his will. Hopefully your BF takes this as a sign that he's going to have to stand his ground more with Dave. \n\nI hope this works out well for you and the BF but your mental health comes first!", "NTA.  If you are living there and helping to pay expenses (which it sounds like you are), you have every right to be comfortable.  I feel for your boyfriend, I know what it's like to hate confrontation plus he obviously cares about his brother, but at this point his brother is just taking advantage of him.  The only one who seems to be getting what they really want is Dave and as he's not even paying his way, that sucks.", "NTA, this is a hill to die on because Dave is just going to get worse about this the longer it is allowed.", "NTA. But if your bf has been putting up with his brother for a year already, cleaning up after him and the whole shebang, odds are he isn\u2019t going to stop doing that for anyone. Probably best that you cut your losses and move on. There\u2019s someone out there for you who doesn\u2019t have a slobby layabout living with him. Find that guy.", "NTA. There is no reason for you to put up with being treated like that. Dave is clearly taking shameless advantage of his brother, and did everything he could to force you out so that he could leech off of your bf unimpeded. \n\nUltimately, you only have control over yourself, and you did the right thing for you. Kudos to you!", "YTA. You moved into this house 1 month ago, brother had been living there for 1 year. You came in and wanted everything to conform to your standards. \n\n1 month in and you demand the brother pay 650 in rent when it sounds like he pays 0. Is the brother a leech? Probably, yes. But your BF and he have an arrangement, don't barge in and demand the terms be changed to your liking. \n\nYou very easily should have been able to see the state of the home before you moved in. If the brother is unclean to a level that bothers you, this should have been easily observable and you should not have moved in at all. \n\nYes, you will divide him from his brother if you give an ultimatum. I'd tell him that you have no intention of living with his brother in the future. That doesn't mean you can't continue to be in a relationship or that he can't move out later into a new place with you.", "Is it wrong that I lol\u2019d at his heart attacking his sucky self? It\u2019s hilarious and I\u2019m stealing it. Thanks, Illustrious-Ad-911!", "ESH. Why did you move in knowing their living situation? I'm sure you saw how unhelpful Dave was, did you ever seen him cleaning the house?Did your bf ask his brother if agreed with you moving in?", "Absolutely NTA, though admittedly I'm a bit confused as to why you moved in at all? Dave and his poor behavior had already been living there for nearly a year by the time you did - I would've made it clear that I'm not moving in until Dave moves out. \n\nIn any case, this may well end your relationship, and from what you've described, it's hard to think that's anything other than a positive for you. Your boyfriend may be otherwise a great guy, but someone who enables his family member the way he does is not someone who is currently suitable for an adult relationship with a future.", "ESH.\n\nDave because he's taking advantage of your BF.\n\nYou for demanding Dave pay rent. Not in any way your place to do that.", "ESH. The brother sounds awful, but you should\u2019ve discussed all of this with your boyfriend before agreeing to move in. Not sure why you expected things to magically change after moving in.", "NTA date someone with a spine", "NTA. \n\nBut also\u2026why did you move in knowing Dave was an issue?", "NTA.  Staying would only hurt your relationship.  If bf grows a backbone with his brother you guys can try living together again but for now I think you made the right call.", "NTA\n\nDave is a mooching freeloader", "NTA. I don't understand why you moved in, but you tried and it didn't work out. Your boyfriend needs to figure out his side of things. Talk to your boyfriend and help him figure out what's best for him. You'll need to know that to decide whether your relationship with him has a future.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019m just not sure why you moved in to begin with, knowing what the situation has been.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to be treated that way. But you should also be prepared to lose your boyfriend. \n\nThe brother should be paying rent and is being disrespectful to you and his brother, but if your bf isn't willing to address that maybe it's best that you don't continue the relationship.", "NTA. But it was incredibly foolish to move in in the first place.", "NTA. Your bf is enabling him and if he doesn\u2019t like confrontation then I can only imagine how the rest of your relationship would go. Sounds like he either shapes up or you move on", "Wait..  His parents are alive? BF need to pack up his shit and move him to the parents house asap...  NTA", "Enough is enough. NTA by a mile", "Major NTA.", "At least Dave will take himself out(in a coffin)", "Yeah feels like this situation was obvious pre move in", "I agree with this. The marina flags were all over this one BEFORE Op moved in. She was expecting changes. She isn't their parent so why will they listen to her when they like the way it was. Her best move was leaving.", "I agree. OP is unrealistic in their expectations. ESA I think. Dave isn't awesome and neither is the bf, but OP moved into their home and started making demands.", "I get most of the points you\u2019re making but isn\u2019t it a reasonable expectation of the brother that if another person moves in he should at least be hygienic/helpful in mutual spaces? *edited for grammar*", "Harsh but I love it"]}
