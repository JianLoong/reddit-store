We both work two jobs and we don\u2019t have a lot of time together but when we do, we try to make the most of it. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s brother, let\u2019s call him Dave, has been living in my bf\u2019s house for a year. Dave has a very bad heart because he used to be a heavy smoker and he is a binge eater. He\u2019s had a heart attack twice in the past two years so he had to retire early. At first, Dave would help out with the dishes a little, but over time he stopped doing chores. \n\nHe buys a ton of food and there\u2019s barely any room in the fridge. When I come over he\u2019s always watching TV in the living room so my boyfriend and I have to go in his room to watch TV. He cooks food and doesn\u2019t clean up after himself so my boyfriend and I are the ones who have to clean up after him. \n\nWhen I talk to my boyfriend about it, he is sick of it too but he says \u201cwell, he\u2019s my brother..\u201d I moved in a month ago and Dave is not happy about that. I was starting to get fed up and I suggested that Dave should pay 650 dollars a month in rent as he has enough money. Dave was very angry. Over the past year, Dave has paid my boyfriend 300 dollars. The final straw for me was when my boyfriend\u2019s family came over to celebrate my bf\u2019s birthday. Whenever I talked, Dave would talk over me. Their family bought a bunch of food and we all cooked, Dave didn\u2019t clean or help out. Their mom said I could have some left over pizza that was in the fridge. Dave ate it while I was sleeping.\n\nThis morning I packed up my stuff and told my boyfriend that I moved out and I won\u2019t move back in until Dave leaves. My bf is divided because he hates confrontation and Dave is his brother. AITA for this? It feels like i\u2019m going to divide him from his brother if I give an ultimatum.", "created_utc": 1668439831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yv2rvp/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_bfs_house_because_his/", "score": 879, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So you are both working 2jobs,and Dave has money but doesn't pay? I guess a lot of the other stuff might be explained away with mental health problems (but in this case he should get help and work on it), but that's one of the two that aren't.\nAnd then there is him being unfriendly to you (I assume you were friendly). The 'watching TV in the living room' could be him trying to get company. All in all I would say you guys should really start to comunicate. Each of you making lists of what you want, and what you are able and willing to give. And then see if you can work out something.", "NTA. But I also feel a bit bad for your BF since he clearly is caught between a rock and a hard place. \n\nYou haven't been with your BF long, and if you are already giving him an ultimatum, it's a sign that he is likely not ready to make the commitment to the relationship that you are willing to. \n\nDave isn't your burden, and his health issues don't give him the right to demand that his family bend over backward to his will. Hopefully your BF takes this as a sign that he's going to have to stand his ground more with Dave. \n\nI hope this works out well for you and the BF but your mental health comes first!", "NTA.  If you are living there and helping to pay expenses (which it sounds like you are), you have every right to be comfortable.  I feel for your boyfriend, I know what it's like to hate confrontation plus he obviously cares about his brother, but at this point his brother is just taking advantage of him.  The only one who seems to be getting what they really want is Dave and as he's not even paying his way, that sucks.", "NTA, this is a hill to die on because Dave is just going to get worse about this the longer it is allowed.", "NTA. But if your bf has been putting up with his brother for a year already, cleaning up after him and the whole shebang, odds are he isn\u2019t going to stop doing that for anyone. Probably best that you cut your losses and move on. There\u2019s someone out there for you who doesn\u2019t have a slobby layabout living with him. Find that guy.", "NTA. There is no reason for you to put up with being treated like that. Dave is clearly taking shameless advantage of his brother, and did everything he could to force you out so that he could leech off of your bf unimpeded. \n\nUltimately, you only have control over yourself, and you did the right thing for you. Kudos to you!", "YTA. You moved into this house 1 month ago, brother had been living there for 1 year. You came in and wanted everything to conform to your standards. \n\n1 month in and you demand the brother pay 650 in rent when it sounds like he pays 0. Is the brother a leech? Probably, yes. But your BF and he have an arrangement, don't barge in and demand the terms be changed to your liking. \n\nYou very easily should have been able to see the state of the home before you moved in. If the brother is unclean to a level that bothers you, this should have been easily observable and you should not have moved in at all. \n\nYes, you will divide him from his brother if you give an ultimatum. I'd tell him that you have no intention of living with his brother in the future. That doesn't mean you can't continue to be in a relationship or that he can't move out later into a new place with you.", "Is it wrong that I lol\u2019d at his heart attacking his sucky self? It\u2019s hilarious and I\u2019m stealing it. Thanks, Illustrious-Ad-911!", "ESH. Why did you move in knowing their living situation? I'm sure you saw how unhelpful Dave was, did you ever seen him cleaning the house?Did your bf ask his brother if agreed with you moving in?", "Absolutely NTA, though admittedly I'm a bit confused as to why you moved in at all? Dave and his poor behavior had already been living there for nearly a year by the time you did - I would've made it clear that I'm not moving in until Dave moves out. \n\nIn any case, this may well end your relationship, and from what you've described, it's hard to think that's anything other than a positive for you. Your boyfriend may be otherwise a great guy, but someone who enables his family member the way he does is not someone who is currently suitable for an adult relationship with a future.", "ESH.\n\nDave because he's taking advantage of your BF.\n\nYou for demanding Dave pay rent. Not in any way your place to do that.", "ESH. The brother sounds awful, but you should\u2019ve discussed all of this with your boyfriend before agreeing to move in. Not sure why you expected things to magically change after moving in.", "NTA date someone with a spine", "NTA. \n\nBut also\u2026why did you move in knowing Dave was an issue?", "NTA.  Staying would only hurt your relationship.  If bf grows a backbone with his brother you guys can try living together again but for now I think you made the right call.", "NTA\n\nDave is a mooching freeloader", "NTA. I don't understand why you moved in, but you tried and it didn't work out. Your boyfriend needs to figure out his side of things. Talk to your boyfriend and help him figure out what's best for him. You'll need to know that to decide whether your relationship with him has a future.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019m just not sure why you moved in to begin with, knowing what the situation has been.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to be treated that way. But you should also be prepared to lose your boyfriend. \n\nThe brother should be paying rent and is being disrespectful to you and his brother, but if your bf isn't willing to address that maybe it's best that you don't continue the relationship.", "NTA. But it was incredibly foolish to move in in the first place.", "NTA. Your bf is enabling him and if he doesn\u2019t like confrontation then I can only imagine how the rest of your relationship would go. Sounds like he either shapes up or you move on", "Wait..  His parents are alive? BF need to pack up his shit and move him to the parents house asap...  NTA", "Enough is enough. NTA by a mile", "Major NTA.", "At least Dave will take himself out(in a coffin)", "Yeah feels like this situation was obvious pre move in", "I agree with this. The marina flags were all over this one BEFORE Op moved in. She was expecting changes. She isn't their parent so why will they listen to her when they like the way it was. Her best move was leaving.", "I agree. OP is unrealistic in their expectations. ESA I think. Dave isn't awesome and neither is the bf, but OP moved into their home and started making demands.", "I get most of the points you\u2019re making but isn\u2019t it a reasonable expectation of the brother that if another person moves in he should at least be hygienic/helpful in mutual spaces? *edited for grammar*", "Harsh but I love it", "NTA. \n\nDave is using your BF.  That Dave has the money, and your BF is still supporting him, that's just wrong.  Dave needs to look into a another situation, maybe assisted living or a support system with caregivers.  Right now, your BF is the unpaid caregiver and that's another way he's being used.  People get paid to do that job.  BF should be paying to also be a caregiver.\n\n**Your BF needs to make the choice who is his priority, his past or his future.**  Once he figures out who is the priority to him, then he can work out solutions to the problems that follow.\n\nDave can try living on someone else for a while.  Or talk to social services and get help for himself.", "NTA", "Nta", "Vacillating between N A H and E S H. Dave was there first and you just moved in and started making demands. yes, Dave is a bad roommate but he also sounds like he's incapacitated. I don't blame you for moving out but you should have foreseen this as the way things were. It's not really your place to force your boyfriend to confront his brother. \n\nINFO: why did you move in? What was wrong with seeing your boyfriend at your place?", "Absolutely NTa. I too would nope tf out of that situation!", "NTA. Dave sounds like a discord mod\ud83e\udd23", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour ultimatum is reasonable. YOur bf will find that his being married to his brother will keep him from having another relationship.", "Your vision of the future is what made you leave. I think your eyes are fine. Hopefully your boyfriend will get the picture.", "Nta. But you might want to reconsider the entire relationship tbh. It sounds like Dave is and will be number one in your boyfriend's life until the day he dies... which will probably be pretty soon", "NTA\nYou need to run from that family.", "Nta. Good for you for standing up for yourself!\n\nBut let's be real here; I don't think this relationship is going anywhere. If you moving out didn't light a fire under your boyfriend, then I don't think anything will. When will your relationship progress to the next stage?", "Umm, why did you move in when you already knew there were issues? Did you think something would magically change?", "NTA\n\nYour bf is spineless, letting a parasite sucking the joy out of his life willingly.\nIf he's not going to protect himself, how the hell he's gonna have your back??", "NTA", "NTA: You're not under any obligation to live somewhere you don't want to live.", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks that your bf's brother is experiencing natural consequences from his behavior, because those consequences suck. But you don't have to live with those consequences or support him during those consequences. Your bf doesn't either. \nBut if he can't live on his own, he definitely shouldn't be living with his brother who is working two jobs. Because saying he can't do x because of his health is fine, but that doesn't mean someone is then obligated to do the x for him. \nAnd he is living rent free and responsibility free, but also still living as he did pre-heart attack, just on someone else's dime and time. \n\nBrother could go to assisted living. Brother could go back to live with parents. Brother could even live independently with paid caregiver support.\n\nUltimatums suck. I usually tell people that if you give an ultimatum, be prepared for the other person to not put up, to not hear you and take you seriously. \nYour bf says \"but that's my brother.\", and it sounds like that is going to be a constant statement in your relationship from here on out if you accept less because he has said you should to so as to not challenge him to stand up for himself and his life, to not confront brother who is selfishly using and disrespecting bf.", "NTA", "Nta\n\nDo not go back.", "NTA. He has to have the discussion. You\u2019re not his mom. If he can\u2019t handle it then move on.", "NTA.  You moved into this situation, however.  So, if you already knew how Dave was, you shouldn't have moved in.   Home needs to be a happy place or it ads an unbearable amount of stress to life.\n\nHaving said that, your BF seems to allow Dave to take advantage of him.  Do you see him ever changing?  You need to do what is best for you - and obviously what is best for you is a Dave-free existence.  Are you OK if this ends the relationship?", "NTA, but I\u2019m just curious why you moved there in the first place? You knew these issues were happening before you got there. Why put yourself in a crappy situation? I know its absolutely not fair to put a relationship \u201con hold\u201d because of another leech living in his home, but it\u2019s probably best you do to save your mental health and your relationship.", "You\u2019ve known all this for 11 months or so and STILL moved in a month ago? Soft YTA. You have a major part in how all this went down. For your own growth I suggest you don\u2019t ignore that. \n\nAnd Dave is an AH. \n\nBut your bf sounds like a saint. Saints are not always easy to spend the rest of your life with.\n\nYou need counseling, first so that someone can help you figure out what you did wrong here and second to decide the next steps. Good luck.", "Very well said. Your first sentence especially. OP living there interrupt their status quo of \u201cDave does want he wants and bf pays for it in literally every way.\u201d \n\nOP will not be a priority in her bf\u2019s life until he grows a backbone.", "[removed]", " I can only imagine how the rest of your relationship would go.", "I remembered when I worked at the critical care hospital one of the Doctors lost it on a family because of this. We were trying to save the patient's life and she had to stop eating bad things, losing weight.

It sounds like he's healthy enough to do so, even if he does have health problems.", "NTA. Your bf needs to stop being a wimp. He's sick of the situation too, but it sounds like Dave is the alpha male, so your bf is excusing his behavior by saying, \"Well, he's my brother.\"\n\nThe problem is that if your bf accedes to your wishes, you'll always be the b\\*\\*\\*h who caused problems between him and Dave and he can hide behind that.
