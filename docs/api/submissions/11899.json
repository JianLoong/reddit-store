Sure, if you fire him he could try to sue. Anybody can try to sue you at any time, for any made up reason. But that's not a reason not to act! \n\nYour company is not firing this employee *because* he's gay, they'd be firing him because he's bad at his job. Put him on a PIP, document the performance issues or ways that he's misrepresented his skills, give him warnings and/or chances to improve, and then fire him. \n\nYour management sucks and I'm willing to bet this isn't the only way they've shown that. NTA", "if you paid for the tuition and cost for materials, they are yours, they do not belong to the company.", "I think you'll get a better response asking this question in a legal or HR sub as it's not really a question of you being an AH, it's about if this is legal and can be reasonably requested by your company. \n\nAre you saying your screwed if you don't hand over your course materials or are you in a position to fire the guy and are worried about doing so? Or are you saying that you refuse to train this person because training is not in your job description? \n\nAssuming you are not completing course work on company time, your notes and class materials are yours and you're not under any obligation to turn them over. Even if you are completing coursework on company time, provided the company has approved it, you have a leg to stand on if the company is not paying your tuition. \n\nDepending on your job description, if it does not include training, then you should not have to train within reason. Document what you do during the day to show that you are completing the tasks you are assigned. Even if training the new employee is in your job description, your class materials are not part of the training. If you are paid to develop training materials, then you would have to show you are doing so, but those materials still do not have to contain your notes or course materials. Handouts and textbook information will typically have their own copyrights and reproduction restrictions in addition to any restrictions provided by the college as previously mentioned. \n\nRefusing to share *company* documentation or show the employee how to do a task can certainly be grounds for your company to take issue with your performance. I would preemptively reach out to the labor board to ask questions. Retaliation is possible if you file a formal complaint, but they can often provide you with some best practices to follow in this situation. \n\nIn terms of the other employee's lack of skill/experience to do the job he was hired for, document those instances. Potentially ask your boss if you are required to train him in areas that he indicated he already possessed the requisite skill.\n\n The fact is that virtually everyone falls into some protected class, even if he files a suit, there is a fairly high burden of proof that he will need to meet to show that his orientation was related to his firing. If he misrepresented his skill set in order to get hired and you and the company can document that, it's a pretty cut and dry situation and any discrimination argument should be moot and subject to a frivolous lawsuit counterclaim. \n\nBe pleasant and cordial in your dealings with him, (that should go without saying). Obviously companies can somewhat easily skirt the job description argument with 'other duties as assigned' but if you are being asked to *cover* for another employee, that's typically a different matter.", "NTA.

He lied about his skill set and is unable to do the job he was hired for.  You fire him for THAT, not his sexual orientation. \n\nTo be clear, everyone is part of a protected class, not just those who are part of a marginalized group, and it is illegal to discriminate against anyone on the basis of a protected characteristic.

When they fire him, his termination notice should provide examples of his incompetence and whatever issues they discover surrounding his resume.
