They broke up due to a disagreement regarding moving in together after Dan\u2019s senior year, which Macy has recounted to me a couple times over the last week as she cried and moaned about the relationship. The deal was, it\u2019s Macy\u2019s junior year and Dan\u2019s senior year, and he brought up moving in together after he graduates and living together during Macy\u2019s senior year. The issue apparently was that Macy already renewed her lease with her current apartment and is locked in until the end of her own senior year. This caused some tension, as he tried to sway her into breaking her lease and moving out early (I was home to hear some of this). She refused due to the terms of breaking the lease (mainly the money she has to pay and how she has to find someone to sublease until her agreement is up) but Dan offered to take care of that for her. \n\nApparently she continued to tell him no, that she\u2019d prefer to wait until her lease is up to move, and Dan let up after a couple weeks and agreed to wait. This led to a whole other argument, though, because when they started to discuss where they would move and what their plans were, Macy said she wanted to rent a 2 bedroom because she \u201cneeds her own personal space\u201d. Dan didn\u2019t like this because obviously sharing a 1 bedroom is cheaper for both of them and he wants to share a bed with her because THEY\u2019RE DATING. Macy insisted on a 2bed, and this led to Dan asking her how she expects them to progress towards or prepare for marriage if she won\u2019t even share a bed with him. She shot back with how even while married she would want her own personal space, and Dan broke up with her on the spot saying this would never work for him.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve run out of sympathy for Macy. When she whined about it again Friday night I finally told her \u201cyeah, well, it\u2019s kind of on you here.\u201d And Macy blew up on me instantly asking how it could possibly be her fault. I told her Dan gave her every opportunity to make this an easy and smooth experience and she kept pushing and arguing and making excuses, so yes, it\u2019s her fault that he got pissed off and broke things off with her. She went into her room after that and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, but some of our mutual friends have sent me rude messages because Macy told them (probably an altered version) what happened. Now I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong here. All I did was tell her the truth.", "created_utc": 1675095179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p6opb/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_its_your_fault/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These people are 21 years old, and Macy is still a *junior* in college. She has a *lot* of major life decisions and changes coming at her in the next year or so.\n\n2. Macy has planned out her college experience such that she has stable housing all the way through til graduation (the lease with her friend through senior year.) \n\n3. Moving in with a partner involves uprooting your entire life, and comes with the risk of having to do that twice, if things don\u2019t work out. \n\nFrom Macy\u2019s POV, if you already have a plan for safe housing through senior year, with your own room and your own space, and it\u2019s all set up and ready to go\u2026why would you want to give that up?\n\nSenior year of college isn\u2019t time to deal with the realities of living with a partner for the first time. Senior year is about studying your butt off and making plans for the future (job search, grad school applications, etc.)\n\nTl;dr Pressuring your gf to move in with you - at any age, but especially when they\u2019re both this young - isn\u2019t a good look. \n\nAnd I voted in a different comment but YTA for what you said to your friend. \n\nIf you\u2019re sick of hearing about it, you can ask her to give you space in a kinder way. Relationships end, and blaming that on her is kinda shitty.", "YTA \n\nPeople have preferences. Your friend has a right to be upset over her relationship ending. She also has the right to want a room for herself and not share it with her bf. Lots of people live this way. They aren't compatible, obviously, but she isn't wrong. The relationship ending isn't her fault and it isn't his fault. They want different things.\n\nYou're an asshole for not supporting your friend.", "YTA. They had different wants and needs and split. That's not unusual, and it was better for this to have happened before her lease was broken. Neither of them are AHs for this. A break-up after college is pretty standard as their lives move in different directions. They clearly want different things.\n\nInstead of supporting your friend, who had been dumped, you got critical. That's an AH move.", "YTA\n\nBreaking a lease in your name can have further consequences beyond just having to pay the money and sublet. If things go wrong, it can seriously affect your credit score, and your future ability to get a mortgage or rent under your own name. Mary is smart to have not broken her lease simply to move in with Dan.\n\nI would not want to live with another adult in a 1 bedroom apartment if a 2 bedroom was something we could afford.\n\nAnd at the heart of this, Dan pressuring Mary to move in with him BEFORE she finishes her schooling is a bad idea FOR MARY.  I think Mary avoided some major issues here. The fact that Dan broke up with her for not giving into his requests (giving him exactly what he wants is NOT compromise).", "YTA Dan dismissed her needs and broke up with her when she wouldn't do what he wanted. It is a completely reasonable desire to have personal space in a relationship. There was nothing going to be smooth and easy about this transition.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not her \"fault\". This is two young people who were not on the same page and broke up.", "YTA \n\nYour friend will hopefully find a reasonable and flexible partner who can vibe with her 2-bedroom request. This dude was not it.\n\nYour friend's wish is not unreasonable or even out of the ordinary. Lots of people opt for separate bedrooms for a variety of reasons. Doesn't mean they love each other any less than 1-bedroom couples. My husband snores like a cave bear and I'd forgotten what a good night's sleep felt like. I LOVE having my own room and I sleep so good every night now; it was a real game-changer. We can \"visit\" each other any time. No issues. I know other couples in healthy relationships that have separate rooms too and it seems to be gaining popularity. \n\nAlso, bf offered to buy her out of her lease but all of a sudden a 2-bedroom apt is too expensive? I can't imagine the buyout for a freshly-signed lease would be cheap. Sounds like you and the bf are buying into this traditional view of how couples are \"supposed\" to live and you are trying to make your friend wrong.", "You're definitely TA here & you're not a \"friend\".\n\nYour obsession with her not wanting to break her lease is weird. God forbid she be an adult & fulfill her legal contracts. Even if he buys her way out, some people take pride in their word and will honor it. It's called integrity.\n\nAnd just because she changed the plan doesn't mean it's any of your business. That's between them. All of this is between him & the fact that you're defending him so vigorously is suspicious. She may have a damn good reason for hesitating that you know nothing about because you're not the one in the relationship with him. (Though it kinda seems like you might want to be.) Friend or not, you're still an outsider in *THEIR* relationship. Why are you even friends with when your dislike of her is so readily apparent?", "YTA I mean they had differing views,that they broke up happens due to that,it's not her fault though.\n\nYou had enough of listening to her complaints,that is also ok,but kicking her while she is already down is not the way to stop it", "YTA for assigning blame here. \n\nThis relationship was not meant to be because they want different things. If Macy wants her personal space, then it's important she finds someone who will be okay with that.", "I'm sorry but it's completely normal to want to have space of your own. Would it be weird if he was asking for an office? Would it be okay if HE was the one making the demands? YTA", "YTA - Macy isn't ready to move in with her boyfriend and she's expressing anxiety over being forced to do so. You didn't tell her the truth. You ignored the fact that your best friend is being pressured into something she clearly doesn't want. She may not have wanted to break up with Dan, but a year is practically nothing when you're 21 and dating.", "N A H, exect you. \n\nThey both have valid, different feelings about sharing/not sharing their space. They aren't compatible, so they broke up. \n\nThis doesn't mean your friend isn't allowed to be *sad* about that, tho. An empathetic friend would understand that. YTA for how you handled everything.", "YTA. I appreciate that not everyone has limitless compassion or patience for others negativity, particularly when it bares repeating. But that that doesn\u2019t mean either of you are at fault, an honest conversation could\u2019ve prevented this. And could still solve this.", "YTA. She is not at fault for having preferences different than her boyfriend. She didn't need you to side with him when she is already having a difficult time with the breakup. Living in a 1BR with another person is difficult, and whether or not they use the 2BR to sleep separately or just to have a separate space, it's a normal expectation or preference for her to have.  She may not be ready to move in with him for her own reasons, and didn't need your input to feel worse about it.", "YTA! It is reasonable for people to want some personal space even when married. Dan was pressuring her to move in with him during her senior year and ignored her about wanting a 2-bedroom apartment. The fact is, they weren't compatible. That is nobody's fault and good that they figured it out now. Of course, it will take time for her to get over it. Breakups are a part of life.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn\u2019t on your friend. This is on the fact that they wanted different things, probably partially because your friend wasn\u2019t ready to commit to a direct pipeline to marriage.\n\nWould it have been better to articulate that? Sure. But it\u2019s not her fault she wasn\u2019t ready. Her boyfriend was also pushing something that she was clearly reluctant to do, and instead of pausing and trying to figure out together why he decided to push harder. \n\nThey weren\u2019t communicating because they are 21/22 and knowing how to be vulnerable even if you want to is hard. \n\nYou came down he\u2019s on your friend on something that wasn\u2019t your business and you came down he\u2019s on the wrong side. Perfectly acceptable to tell her you can\u2019t be her sounding board anymore, but you were out of line to judge her for not wanting something you clearly think everyone would want.", "YTA\n\n\nYour BEST FRIEND has needs that weren't being met in her relationship. Her bf was trying to rush her into something she didn't want, then broke up with her when he didn't get his own way. \n\n\nThen she came to you and you shat all over her. How supportive. \n\n\nIt's OK if your friend wants a 2 bed. What's wrong with that? She needs personal space, even in a loving relationship. So what? That doesn't make her wrong. It makes this relationship wrong for her. \n\n\nAs an alternative, you could've said something along the lines of \"I know it sucks now, but it sounds like he was trying to push you into something you didn't really want, and wasn't interested in listening and catering to your needs, so maybe it's for the best in the long run.\"\n\n\nYou know, in case you ever felt the need to actually be supportive of your BEST FRIEND. \n\n\nOr just keep putting her down and telling her she's wrong for having standards and boundaries. But you're wrong.\n\nEdit: typos", "Okay, when it comes to the breakup, it isn\u2019t either of their fault, based on the story we get, which is entirely 3rd hand (as it\u2019s Macy telling you telling us). That means there are definitely gaps and nuance we aren\u2019t getting.\n\nThey\u2019re incompatible. That\u2019s it. Dan has expectations and wants when living together, Macy has expectations and wants when living together, and they don\u2019t match up at all. Of course Macy thinks Dan is an asshole, because he initiated the breakup. That\u2019s to be expected. Still, it is clear they simply weren\u2019t meant to be.\n\nI get she\u2019s upset that her relationship ended, but they were just an incompatible couple. It sucks but that\u2019s life. That\u2019s why people date, to see if they\u2019re compatible for the long term. Dan and Macy are not, so they broke up.\n\nNow where you come in, it\u2019s pretty clear based on this post that you may not even agree with Dan. Rather, you said what you said because you were sick of Macy being upset about the breakup and you wanted her to shut up about it. So you told her it was her fault, hoping it would get her to stop bothering you with the subject.\n\nI mean\u2026. It worked.\n\nQuite frankly, you snapped and said something shitty. Now you\u2019re retroactively trying to justify yourself because you don\u2019t want to be the \u201cbad guy.\u201d But in this case, you\u2019re the bad guy. You made a mistake. Own it and apologize for snapping at her.\n\nYou should support your friend. You don\u2019t have to shit on Dan, you don\u2019t have to shit on Macy, you can simply listen and let her vent and encourage her to find ways to move on.\n\nSo in this instance, YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYour friends boyfriend was not listening to her or respecting her boundaries. You just shamed her for standing up for herself because it has left her heartbroken, but still - good for her for respecting herself and her desires here. You and her bf should get together and try sharing a 1 bed and see how well you do.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think your friend is completely blameless in the breakup, but she\u2019s definitely not entirely to blame, and it was definitely wrong of you to assume that.\n\nPersonal space isn\u2019t a big crazy ask - it\u2019s not about not sharing a bed with your partner, it\u2019s about having a space where you can have some alone time, or do tasks that require focus/privacy. Breaking a lease is also a pretty big deal; even paying to get out of it is never an \u201ceasy and smooth experience\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to demonize your friend for voicing her needs. Would you have preferred if she said nothing and ended up in a situation that made her even more miserable?\n\nAll this said, it\u2019s okay for you to be tired of comforting someone, or having stressful convos. If this is what lead to you making that statement, I think it may be worthwhile to work on realizing when this is happening & figuring out how to communicate it properly in the future.", "Info:\n\nIf Dan can afford to \u201ctake care\u201d of the money Macy will have to pay to break her lease now, why is he concerned about the relatively small difference between the cost of a 1 and 2 bedroom apartment in a year? Macy will have graduated by then and presumably be more able to contribute financially, so what was his problem?", "This is a bit N A H but skewing slightly toward ESH. \n\nYou have heard *some* of the argument, not all of it and you're placing all the blame solely on her. She does need to accept some of the responsibility in that perhaps she wasn't being pragmatic in the costs of having a 2bed, especially when they're just starting their careers. \n\n*However*, a lot of what she requested wasn't unreasonable. She is legally responsible for the lease she signed back on for and if she can't find a tenant, that's a big financial strain. And having a bit of space in the apartment for yourself isn't a huge ask either.", "NTA. It sounds like Macy isn't ready to move in with Dan, but Dan also seems like he's trying to move in with her because that's just what you do on the path to getting married. You were right to call her out but she may also be feeling pressured into doing something she isn't quite ready to do, so the blame may not entirely be on her.", "NTA\n\nShe should have been honest and tell what she wants from the start, or when she figured out what she needs.", "NTA and I'd tell everyone who messaged you what actually happened", "NTA.

You're friend is smart for knowing what she wants and having healthy expectations. You should not have been so rude to her. \n\nIt's not uncommon to have your own space when living with a partner. More people should do it too. My now husband and I did that when we first lived together. It was the best decision we made. We were young and having our own space really helped us. It's actually something I recommend for new relationships. Having your own space gives you a place to go after a difficult day at work or when you're overly emotional. You also don't have to immediately agree on who's stuff to keep or put away. You can keep your individualism. We still shared a bed and stuff but there was a mutual decision about our own space.

They're just not compatible and neither of them are assholes, they just want different things from a relationship.  \nOP is the asshole though for not realizing that and basically calling her friend out for wanting to be happy in a relationship lol", "Bullshit.  A relationship isn't 'her needs must be respected, his are meaningless.'  It's perfectly natural to want to sleep with your spouse.\n\nIt's perfectly fine that they're not fundamentally compatible, but to characterize this as Dan being some sort of controlling asshole is rank misandry.", "Yea, Macy dodged a bullet!", "It wasn\u2019t freshly signed, this is her second year at this apartment, and the upcoming lease she renewed is her third year. Breaking the lease here is only $500. Which is a lot less in the short term than the additional hundreds to thousands they would save by getting a 1bed to share instead of a 2bed", "Lol breaking the lease doesn't mean defaulting on it, it means paying a fee to terminate it early", "I got the impression by her space she meant room and that is her bedroom.", "I think regarding the relationship both had fair points,they didn't fit together due to that.\n\nDoesn't mean OP wasn't A here", "Well then she shouldve stopped mentioning it to OP. Not really sure what Macy expected after complaining constantly. She had an odd request that her bf said he couldn\u2019t handle and he broke it off. OP also didnt agree with Macy\u2019s decision and let it be known.", "One could argue he respected her wishes/boundaries by breaking up\u2026", "I might be an asshole myself, but to me it doesn't sound like Dan didn't respect Macy's boundaries. He gave up on his initial plan (admittedly after \"a couple weeks\" which sounds a bit too long for this kinda conversation) and when he found out that her plans for the future looked wildly different from his, he broke up. I find that to be the only sensible solution and I don't think either of them are TA for wanting different things out of a relationship. They're just not compatible.", ">YTA. I don\u2019t think your friend is completely blameless in the breakup, but she\u2019s definitely not entirely to blame, and it was definitely wrong of you to assume that.\n\nAgreed, but also, does it really matter? When your best friend gets dumped, it's not the moment to engage in a forensic analysis of how much blame they bear vs. their ex. Like, come on. Basic human decency means being kind and supportive, or at a bare minimum not kicking them further while they're down.", "Where do you live that the cost between a 1 and 2 bedroom apartment is a relatively small difference?", "Relatively small difference depends highly on area. The difference between a decent 2b and 1b where I live is going to run you an extra 800-1200 a month", "I don't think it matters whether the Mary or Dan is in the right. If your close friend gets dumped, it's a shitty, cruel thing to do to tell them \"you deserved it,\" absent really awful behavior like cheating or abuse.", "We're not being asked to judge if Dan was within his rights to dump Mary, we're being asked to judge whether it's an AH move to tell your close friend they deserved to be dumped after they get their heart broken. Which yes, clearly, it is. The fact that it's \"the truth\" doesn't really change whether it's a shitty thing to say.\n\nAnd anyway, this just sounds like Mary and Dan weren't compatible. That means Mary isn't allowed to be upset?", "He dumped her because she didn't just agree to what he wanted...", "He's pressuring her into something she clearly isn't ready for.

Wanting different amounts of space or timelines for moving in together is fine, although definitely a dealbreaker for some people. But it sounds like he really leaned on her about it and couldn't accept that she wants different things than him.", "He's an A for not accepting that she had different goals for her life in the short term and ending the relationship because he didn't immediately get his way.", "Having personal space doesn't mean they won't be sharing a bed. It's good to have a place to go that's all or mostly yours so you can get that alone time if you need it. It doesn't mean you won't sleep with your partner. That was one piece of information that seemed to be left out or omitted or bypassed by Macy and Dan.", "I guess you can go try to fuck Dan and then let him make all your decisions for you, since you agree with every single thing he says.", "I noticed you said that Macy is your ROOMMATE. What exactly where you planning to do with the apartment if she broke her lease, which has been thwarted here?", "Okay, and? Paying to break the lease doesn't cover the cost of 12 months worth of rent you guaranteed them when you signed up. If they want to pay off the rent, that's one thing. But having a consistent tenant is an insurance policy which is why most people require a year+ lease at a time. If she doesn't want to break it, she doesn't want to break it & that's her prerogative.", "A 2 bedroom apartment is generally cheaper than 2 one bedroom apartments, which is where they were.", "Sometimes, if you get a 2 bedroom 1 bath, it\u2019s actually less expensive than a deluxe 1 bedroom. Balconies, views, fireplaces\u2026 lots of things can add to the price. \n\nIn Huntsville, Alabama, it\u2019s $1279 - $1751 for a 1 bedroom or $1679 - $2151 for a 2 in the complex.", "What a lovely friendship if you are not allowed to say something when your friend is being an ass... I wasn't talking about if he had a right to leave her, that sentence is my opinion why she had the right to tell her friend that it was her fault. Because it was!", "He dumped her because he wanted to share a room. He didnt want the extra expense, he wanted to share a room and bed with his gf who he saw as a future wife. Youre acting like the stuff he wanted to do was crazy when its the most basic norm in the world. Tbh if you cant share a room with someone you think will be your spouse you should end it while you have the chance", "Oh interesting! I didn\u2019t think about that specifically, but that\u2019s a really good point! \n\nI\u2019m surprised that no one\u2019s pointed out how hard the adjustment period of living with a partner can be, even in the best of circumstances. And that\u2019s such a good example of one of the *many* things that can go wrong.", "Except he didn't push.  He agreed to wait, then opened a conversation about a fundamental issue that would need to be addressed for their relationship to continue.  She indicated that she would always want to sleep separately, so he respected her boundary and, instead of pushing, ended the relationship that wasn't going to meet his perfectly normal and legitimate own wants and needs.", "He stopped pushing. So how is he an AH for deciding they weren\u2019t compatible for what he wanted in the future?", "She said it\u2019s not short term, she wants a separate bed even after marriage.", "Well first, he did accept it, he just also prioritized his own wants and needs.  He doesn't need to stay in a relationship that isn't going to fulfill him just to keep her happy.\n\nSecond, if by 'short term' you mean 'unambiguous declaration of how the relationship would work forever,' yes.", "Whether or not she breaks her lease doesn\u2019t concern me. We have separate leases. I don\u2019t have any plans to be made if she moves out, it doesn\u2019t really affect my living situation.", "Refusing to break a lease out of some perceived obligation to or concern for your landlord is weird and servile, not a sign of honesty.

It's *unkind* to tell your recently-dumped best friend who's crying about their relationship \"you deserved it, sucks to suck.'", "I know a perfectly happy married couple who sleep in different rooms. They have different waking hours and one is a very light sleeper. Sharing a room is not a requirement for marriage.\n\nAlso, not all cultures priotize sharing a bed in a marriage. This is a very Western idea.", "I have known too many women who moved in with their slightly-older boyfriends who graduated before them, before the end of undergrad. And many of those are the women who end up not finishing those few last credits to graduate. Because once they were living together, the guy pretty much started to demand that being a wife-like-person (even if unmarried) and housekeeper was more important than being a student.\n\nIt's a great way to undermine someone who is almost through with their university education. It really stands in the way of being able to move on as an adult.", "That's not what the OP says. The OP says that Mary said she'd want her own personal space after marriage. I've always had my own personal space--crafting room, library area, office.", "Well, you know, except if she fails to find anyone to sublease, you have the place to yourself.\n\nOne of my ex-roommates managed to harass and run off everyone who the university put in with her after I moved out mid-year (not a similar story to this). Luckily, it was the university's responsibility to keep throwing new meat at her.", "She doesn't want to, bottomline, so that's irrelevant. It's her choice to be \"servile\" if she wants to. It's none of the friend's business either way.", "Bro do yk how many European and South American cultures there are that don\u2019t even give their children their own room until their like 4 or 5. Some Asian countries literally share one room until all the kids have moved out. You have no clue what your on about", "It's assumed. Ofc both should have their personal space and I agree with you, but idc this paragraph makes me think she wanted to sleep in her own bed all the time. If that's the case, I'd consider breaking up too.\n\n>Macy insisted on a 2bed, and this led to Dan asking her how she expects them to progress towards or prepare for marriage if *she won\u2019t even share a bed with him*. She shot back with how even while married she would want her own personal space, and Dan broke up with her on the spot saying this would never work for him.", "Oh, that\u2019s a conflict of interest I hadn\u2019t considered. I was wondering why in the hell OP was so overly opinionated about and vested in Macy\u2019s relationship and living choices - that makes more sense in light of you saying that. Oh, OP - YTA.", "How is that relevant?", "This sounds like Dan making an assumption.\n\nBut also, there are married couples who don't always sleep in the same bed. If that doesn't work for him, fine, but it's also not her fault if she doesn't.", "You just said sharing beds is a very western idea. But it started in Asia and just about every other country first. Youre just spewing whatever. Guarantee you dont \u201cknow a perfectly happy married couple who sleep in different rooms\u201d", "Completely agree. AnOutrageousCloud was talking like Dan was the a-hole, I disagree about that. Macy isn't either.\n\nDan might be making an assumption, I would've made the same.", "I agree. In the context of the conversation they were having, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he interpreted it as her not wanting to share a bed though. I think they both most likely made assumptions; she didn\u2019t define what \u201cspace\u201d meant to her and assumed he would understand where she was. Point from and he made an assumption that she meant she didn\u2019t want to share a bed. I don\u2019t think either are an AH they just found out they weren\u2019t compatible with what they wanted in the future.", "I do. My parents. (well, until Mom passed away)\n\nThey were the most in love, happy couple I've ever known, married for 54 years, and they had separate bedrooms.", "My grandparents had separate bedrooms. The most in love couple I\u2019ve ever known. Celebrated over 50 years married and died within a year of each other.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a luxury (that my grandparents absolutely earned and didn\u2019t have until their children moved out) but it\u2019s a very traditional concept in many cultures."]}
