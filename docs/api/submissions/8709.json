{"id": 8709, "submission_id": "10p6opb", "title": "AITA For Telling My Best Friend \u201cIt\u2019s your fault\u201d?", "selftext": "For some context, my [21F] best friend & roommate Macy [21F] recently broke up with her boyfriend Dan [22M] of about a year. They broke up due to a disagreement regarding moving in together after Dan\u2019s senior year, which Macy has recounted to me a couple times over the last week as she cried and moaned about the relationship. The deal was, it\u2019s Macy\u2019s junior year and Dan\u2019s senior year, and he brought up moving in together after he graduates and living together during Macy\u2019s senior year. The issue apparently was that Macy already renewed her lease with her current apartment and is locked in until the end of her own senior year. This caused some tension, as he tried to sway her into breaking her lease and moving out early (I was home to hear some of this). She refused due to the terms of breaking the lease (mainly the money she has to pay and how she has to find someone to sublease until her agreement is up) but Dan offered to take care of that for her. \n\nApparently she continued to tell him no, that she\u2019d prefer to wait until her lease is up to move, and Dan let up after a couple weeks and agreed to wait. This led to a whole other argument, though, because when they started to discuss where they would move and what their plans were, Macy said she wanted to rent a 2 bedroom because she \u201cneeds her own personal space\u201d. Dan didn\u2019t like this because obviously sharing a 1 bedroom is cheaper for both of them and he wants to share a bed with her because THEY\u2019RE DATING. Macy insisted on a 2bed, and this led to Dan asking her how she expects them to progress towards or prepare for marriage if she won\u2019t even share a bed with him. She shot back with how even while married she would want her own personal space, and Dan broke up with her on the spot saying this would never work for him.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve run out of sympathy for Macy. When she whined about it again Friday night I finally told her \u201cyeah, well, it\u2019s kind of on you here.\u201d And Macy blew up on me instantly asking how it could possibly be her fault. I told her Dan gave her every opportunity to make this an easy and smooth experience and she kept pushing and arguing and making excuses, so yes, it\u2019s her fault that he got pissed off and broke things off with her. She went into her room after that and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, but some of our mutual friends have sent me rude messages because Macy told them (probably an altered version) what happened. Now I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong here. All I did was tell her the truth.", "created_utc": 1675095179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p6opb/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_its_your_fault/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These people are 21 years old, and Macy is still a *junior* in college. She has a *lot* of major life decisions and changes coming at her in the next year or so.\n\n2. Macy has planned out her college experience such that she has stable housing all the way through til graduation (the lease with her friend through senior year.) \n\n3. Moving in with a partner involves uprooting your entire life, and comes with the risk of having to do that twice, if things don\u2019t work out. \n\nFrom Macy\u2019s POV, if you already have a plan for safe housing through senior year, with your own room and your own space, and it\u2019s all set up and ready to go\u2026why would you want to give that up?\n\nSenior year of college isn\u2019t time to deal with the realities of living with a partner for the first time. Senior year is about studying your butt off and making plans for the future (job search, grad school applications, etc.)\n\nTl;dr Pressuring your gf to move in with you - at any age, but especially when they\u2019re both this young - isn\u2019t a good look. \n\nAnd I voted in a different comment but YTA for what you said to your friend. \n\nIf you\u2019re sick of hearing about it, you can ask her to give you space in a kinder way. Relationships end, and blaming that on her is kinda shitty.", "YTA \n\nPeople have preferences. Your friend has a right to be upset over her relationship ending. She also has the right to want a room for herself and not share it with her bf. Lots of people live this way. They aren't compatible, obviously, but she isn't wrong. The relationship ending isn't her fault and it isn't his fault. They want different things.\n\nYou're an asshole for not supporting your friend.", "YTA. They had different wants and needs and split. That's not unusual, and it was better for this to have happened before her lease was broken. Neither of them are AHs for this. A break-up after college is pretty standard as their lives move in different directions. They clearly want different things.\n\nInstead of supporting your friend, who had been dumped, you got critical. That's an AH move.", "YTA\n\nBreaking a lease in your name can have further consequences beyond just having to pay the money and sublet. If things go wrong, it can seriously affect your credit score, and your future ability to get a mortgage or rent under your own name. Mary is smart to have not broken her lease simply to move in with Dan.\n\nI would not want to live with another adult in a 1 bedroom apartment if a 2 bedroom was something we could afford.\n\nAnd at the heart of this, Dan pressuring Mary to move in with him BEFORE she finishes her schooling is a bad idea FOR MARY.  I think Mary avoided some major issues here. The fact that Dan broke up with her for not giving into his requests (giving him exactly what he wants is NOT compromise).", "YTA Dan dismissed her needs and broke up with her when she wouldn't do what he wanted. It is a completely reasonable desire to have personal space in a relationship. There was nothing going to be smooth and easy about this transition.\n\nEdit: In this comment, I'm not saying if Dan is an asshole or not. I'm saying that OP is an asshole because OP was a bad friend who had a poor understanding of the situation.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not her \"fault\". This is two young people who were not on the same page and broke up.", "YTA \n\nYour friend will hopefully find a reasonable and flexible partner who can vibe with her 2-bedroom request. This dude was not it.\n\nYour friend's wish is not unreasonable or even out of the ordinary. Lots of people opt for separate bedrooms for a variety of reasons. Doesn't mean they love each other any less than 1-bedroom couples. My husband snores like a cave bear and I'd forgotten what a good night's sleep felt like. I LOVE having my own room and I sleep so good every night now; it was a real game-changer. We can \"visit\" each other any time. No issues. I know other couples in healthy relationships that have separate rooms too and it seems to be gaining popularity. \n\nAlso, bf offered to buy her out of her lease but all of a sudden a 2-bedroom apt is too expensive? I can't imagine the buyout for a freshly-signed lease would be cheap. Sounds like you and the bf are buying into this traditional view of how couples are \"supposed\" to live and you are trying to make your friend wrong.", "You're definitely TA here & you're not a \"friend\".\n\nYour obsession with her not wanting to break her lease is weird. God forbid she be an adult & fulfill her legal contracts. Even if he buys her way out, some people take pride in their word and will honor it. It's called integrity.\n\nAnd just because she changed the plan doesn't mean it's any of your business. That's between them. All of this is between him & the fact that you're defending him so vigorously is suspicious. She may have a damn good reason for hesitating that you know nothing about because you're not the one in the relationship with him. (Though it kinda seems like you might want to be.) Friend or not, you're still an outsider in *THEIR* relationship. Why are you even friends with when your dislike of her is so readily apparent?", "YTA I mean they had differing views,that they broke up happens due to that,it's not her fault though.\n\nYou had enough of listening to her complaints,that is also ok,but kicking her while she is already down is not the way to stop it", "YTA for assigning blame here. \n\nThis relationship was not meant to be because they want different things. If Macy wants her personal space, then it's important she finds someone who will be okay with that.", "I'm sorry but it's completely normal to want to have space of your own. Would it be weird if he was asking for an office? Would it be okay if HE was the one making the demands? YTA", "YTA - Macy isn't ready to move in with her boyfriend and she's expressing anxiety over being forced to do so. You didn't tell her the truth. You ignored the fact that your best friend is being pressured into something she clearly doesn't want. She may not have wanted to break up with Dan, but a year is practically nothing when you're 21 and dating.", "N A H, exect you. \n\nThey both have valid, different feelings about sharing/not sharing their space. They aren't compatible, so they broke up. \n\nThis doesn't mean your friend isn't allowed to be *sad* about that, tho. An empathetic friend would understand that. YTA for how you handled everything.", "YTA. I appreciate that not everyone has limitless compassion or patience for others negativity, particularly when it bares repeating. But that that doesn\u2019t mean either of you are at fault, an honest conversation could\u2019ve prevented this. And could still solve this.", "YTA. She is not at fault for having preferences different than her boyfriend. She didn't need you to side with him when she is already having a difficult time with the breakup. Living in a 1BR with another person is difficult, and whether or not they use the 2BR to sleep separately or just to have a separate space, it's a normal expectation or preference for her to have.  She may not be ready to move in with him for her own reasons, and didn't need your input to feel worse about it.", "YTA! It is reasonable for people to want some personal space even when married. Dan was pressuring her to move in with him during her senior year and ignored her about wanting a 2-bedroom apartment. The fact is, they weren't compatible. That is nobody's fault and good that they figured it out now. Of course, it will take time for her to get over it. Breakups are a part of life.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn\u2019t on your friend. This is on the fact that they wanted different things, probably partially because your friend wasn\u2019t ready to commit to a direct pipeline to marriage.\n\nWould it have been better to articulate that? Sure. But it\u2019s not her fault she wasn\u2019t ready. Her boyfriend was also pushing something that she was clearly reluctant to do, and instead of pausing and trying to figure out together why he decided to push harder. \n\nThey weren\u2019t communicating because they are 21/22 and knowing how to be vulnerable even if you want to is hard. \n\nYou came down he\u2019s on your friend on something that wasn\u2019t your business and you came down he\u2019s on the wrong side. Perfectly acceptable to tell her you can\u2019t be her sounding board anymore, but you were out of line to judge her for not wanting something you clearly think everyone would want.", "YTA\n\n\nYour BEST FRIEND has needs that weren't being met in her relationship. Her bf was trying to rush her into something she didn't want, then broke up with her when he didn't get his own way. \n\n\nThen she came to you and you shat all over her. How supportive. \n\n\nIt's OK if your friend wants a 2 bed. What's wrong with that? She needs personal space, even in a loving relationship. So what? That doesn't make her wrong. It makes this relationship wrong for her. \n\n\nAs an alternative, you could've said something along the lines of \"I know it sucks now, but it sounds like he was trying to push you into something you didn't really want, and wasn't interested in listening and catering to your needs, so maybe it's for the best in the long run.\"\n\n\nYou know, in case you ever felt the need to actually be supportive of your BEST FRIEND. \n\n\nOr just keep putting her down and telling her she's wrong for having standards and boundaries. But you're wrong.\n\nEdit: typos", "Okay, when it comes to the breakup, it isn\u2019t either of their fault, based on the story we get, which is entirely 3rd hand (as it\u2019s Macy telling you telling us). That means there are definitely gaps and nuance we aren\u2019t getting.\n\nThey\u2019re incompatible. That\u2019s it. Dan has expectations and wants when living together, Macy has expectations and wants when living together, and they don\u2019t match up at all. Of course Macy thinks Dan is an asshole, because he initiated the breakup. That\u2019s to be expected. Still, it is clear they simply weren\u2019t meant to be.\n\nI get she\u2019s upset that her relationship ended, but they were just an incompatible couple. It sucks but that\u2019s life. That\u2019s why people date, to see if they\u2019re compatible for the long term. Dan and Macy are not, so they broke up.\n\nNow where you come in, it\u2019s pretty clear based on this post that you may not even agree with Dan. Rather, you said what you said because you were sick of Macy being upset about the breakup and you wanted her to shut up about it. So you told her it was her fault, hoping it would get her to stop bothering you with the subject.\n\nI mean\u2026. It worked.\n\nQuite frankly, you snapped and said something shitty. Now you\u2019re retroactively trying to justify yourself because you don\u2019t want to be the \u201cbad guy.\u201d But in this case, you\u2019re the bad guy. You made a mistake. Own it and apologize for snapping at her.\n\nYou should support your friend. You don\u2019t have to shit on Dan, you don\u2019t have to shit on Macy, you can simply listen and let her vent and encourage her to find ways to move on.\n\nSo in this instance, YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYour friends boyfriend was not listening to her or respecting her boundaries. You just shamed her for standing up for herself because it has left her heartbroken, but still - good for her for respecting herself and her desires here. You and her bf should get together and try sharing a 1 bed and see how well you do.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think your friend is completely blameless in the breakup, but she\u2019s definitely not entirely to blame, and it was definitely wrong of you to assume that.\n\nPersonal space isn\u2019t a big crazy ask - it\u2019s not about not sharing a bed with your partner, it\u2019s about having a space where you can have some alone time, or do tasks that require focus/privacy. Breaking a lease is also a pretty big deal; even paying to get out of it is never an \u201ceasy and smooth experience\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to demonize your friend for voicing her needs. Would you have preferred if she said nothing and ended up in a situation that made her even more miserable?\n\nAll this said, it\u2019s okay for you to be tired of comforting someone, or having stressful convos. If this is what lead to you making that statement, I think it may be worthwhile to work on realizing when this is happening & figuring out how to communicate it properly in the future.", "Info:\n\nIf Dan can afford to \u201ctake care\u201d of the money Macy will have to pay to break her lease now, why is he concerned about the relatively small difference between the cost of a 1 and 2 bedroom apartment in a year? Macy will have graduated by then and presumably be more able to contribute financially, so what was his problem?", "This is a bit N A H but skewing slightly toward ESH. \n\nYou have heard *some* of the argument, not all of it and you're placing all the blame solely on her. She does need to accept some of the responsibility in that perhaps she wasn't being pragmatic in the costs of having a 2bed, especially when they're just starting their careers. \n\n*However*, a lot of what she requested wasn't unreasonable. She is legally responsible for the lease she signed back on for and if she can't find a tenant, that's a big financial strain. And having a bit of space in the apartment for yourself isn't a huge ask either.", "NTA. It sounds like Macy isn't ready to move in with Dan, but Dan also seems like he's trying to move in with her because that's just what you do on the path to getting married. You were right to call her out but she may also be feeling pressured into doing something she isn't quite ready to do, so the blame may not entirely be on her.", "NTA\n\nShe should have been honest and tell what she wants from the start, or when she figured out what she needs.", "NTA and I'd tell everyone who messaged you what actually happened", "NTA.

You're friend is smart for knowing what she wants and having healthy expectations. You should not have been so rude to her. \n\nIt's not uncommon to have your own space when living with a partner. More people should do it too. My now husband and I did that when we first lived together. It was the best decision we made. We were young and having our own space really helped us. It's actually something I recommend for new relationships. Having your own space gives you a place to go after a difficult day at work or when you're overly emotional. You also don't have to immediately agree on who's stuff to keep or put away. You can keep your individualism. We still shared a bed and stuff but there was a mutual decision about our own space.
