{"id": 3064, "submission_id": "z2scdz", "title": "AITA for not filling the gas tank in my girlfriend's car?", "selftext": "Early this past weekend, the catalytic converter from my car was stolen while I was at work. I had made plans to go to my mom's house towards the end of the weekend to help with some chores and spend an afternoon with her. Before I even asked my girlfriend if I could borrow her car in order to go to my mom's house, she had offered to let me use her car for the day, saying she wouldn't need it that day. Super nice of her, and I was very grateful.\n\nWhen I get in her car to go to my mom's house, I notice the gas tank is just over a quarter full - plenty to get to my mom's house as it is about 10 miles away. Since my girlfriend was kind and let me borrow my car, I wanted to help in some way, so instead of filling the tank, I had her car washed instead. It had been at least a month since she last had her car washed, and I spent more time washing her car than I normally spend washing my own. I take the car to my mom's, bring it back and return the keys to my girlfriend, and I thought that would be it.\n\nFast forward to last night, my girlfriend and I are coming home from dinner with her parents, with us driving her car (since mine is still at the mechanic's). She makes a sarcastic comment at some point along the lines of \"Oh, thanks for filling up my car when you used it a few days ago.\" I mention to her that instead of filling up the tank, I washed her car as a way of saying thank you for letting me borrow it. She replies with \"Thanks, but normally when someone borrows someone else's car, they fill it up when they're done. And you left me nearly on empty.\" I responded with \"I understand that's normally what people do, but since I only used it for one trip, and since you were already pretty low when I needed to use it, I didn't think I should have to fill nearly your entire tank (probably about $50). And when I got home, the gauge said just under a quarter tank, plenty to get you to work and back the next day. That's why I washed it instead.\" She replies \"Well in the future, if you need to borrow my car, please fill it when you're done.\" Wanting to avoid arguing, I just said \"Okay, will do\" and left it at that. \n\nWe didn't go to bed that night angry or anything, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. I fully acknowledge that the convention when borrowing a car is to fill the tank up when you return it, but the reasons I didn't think that necessary/justified in this situation: 1) I only needed it one trip on one day for a few hours, a total of no more than 20 miles. 2) I had it washed instead, still spending time and money on it to show my appreciation. 3) Filling up the tank all the way would have cost much more than the gas that I used, and with having to buy a new catalytic converter for my own car, I'm trying to be careful with money for the next month or two.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669218106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2scdz/aita_for_not_filling_the_gas_tank_in_my/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can wash a car anytime and even for free if you do it at home but gas you have to goto a station and to pay for it! So yes gas wouldve been a bigger deal you shouldve atleast put in another quarter so that wouldve been like your quarter to use also +10 miles is still a long distance to drive but thats not really relevant", "YTA - she does a favor for you, you choose to inconvenience her further and cost her money. A dirty car still gets you to work, no gas doesn\u2019t. She also didn\u2019t explicitly ask you to fill the entire tank up, so based off how you and she phrased this, I think her point was you added no gas, not that you didn\u2019t fill the whole tank up. \n\nCommon courtesy is at minimum fill the tank to where you left it, normally a smidge extra for inconveniencing them.", "YTA Assholes take and don't give back. Washing the car is an empty gesture designed to make you look and feel better in this situation.", "Replacing what you used isn\u2019t a \u201cway to say thank you.\u201d It\u2019s the bare minimum required to be allowed to borrow her car you weirdo.

You don't need to *fill* the tank (I have never hear of that, especially when the fuel gauge is below half), but $10 worth of gas would have been good, and you probably spent that much at the car wash. if you drove 20 miles, assuming her car gets 20mph, $10 would have more than replaced what you used.", ">Since my girlfriend was kind and let me borrow my car, I wanted to help in some way, so instead of filling the tank, I had her car washed instead.\n\nYTA.  \n\n>1) I only needed it one trip on one day for a few hours, a total of no more than 20 miles.\n\nSo put less than a full tank in it.\n\n>2) I had it washed instead, still spending time and money on it to show my appreciation.\n\nTo people who don't care, that's just wasted time and money.

Gas is expensive, and probably way more important to her than a cleaning.", "What would it have cost to rideshare or taxi to your Mom's? That's the LEAST you should have put in the tank.

Washing the car is not nice if your girlfriend has to unexpectedly rush to the gas station.", "YTA, the rule of thumb when you borrow something is to return it in as good or better condition than when you got it. Washing it was nice, but you forgot to replace what you consumed. You didn't need to fill the tank, but you should have returned it with at least the same amount as when you borrowed it. Doing so shows that you respect her time and money.", "YTA. \n\nSure you didn't need to fully fill her tank if you took it 20 miles, but you made it so she had to get gas right away to use her own car. \n\nIf she had a quarter of a tank and you used the car to go 20 miles, you likely left the tank on E (not that it was out of gas, just that it was at the warning light level or close to it). You could have at least put $15 worth of gas in the car so she didn't have to worry about gas as soon as she used the car. \n\nWhen you borrow something, you should never give it back worse off than it was when you got it. In this case, that's exactly what you did. She didn't need a clean car, she needed a car with gas in it. You did something that was free to you and decided it was better than giving her money, and you know that isn't true. A clean car without gas in it is inferior to a dirty car with gas in it.", "I get that you\u2019re tight on money, but replace the gas you used is the bare minimum.", "Gas makes car go. No gas, no go. Big inconvenience.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, YTA. You had issues with your car, and she let you borrow hers. The money for the car wash would have been much better spent on gas (especially with current prices) since you used it.", "YTA. You did not have to fill the car but you could have put a quarter tank of gas in so she wasn\u2019t on empty.", "YTA. You took her car, which had quarter a tank of gas and returned it on nearly empty. This is a big annoyance since she now had to take the time out of her day after being caught off guard that she had no gas to get anywhere after you used it all. Her not washing her car shows its not a priority to her. You were being a cheapskate. You should have at least put her gas back on a quarter full. If it was me, I'd never let you use my car again.", "YTA. Given the fact you said that it would be probably $50 to fill up (gas station prices vary this as well), your girlfriends vehicle is probably about the size of a SUV if not bigger (basing this off the size of my own vehicle which is anywhere between 30-45 to fill). At a minimum put in 10 dollars worth of gas, which depending on the vehicle would put the gas gauge at halfway between half and empty.  My neighbor doesn\u2019t drive, instead if she needs to go to the store and I\u2019m available she gives me gas money in order to help replace the gas that was used to drive her to the store (half the time my car is full and I use the money to pay for food during the work week).", "YTA. You don't have to fill it up but you absolutely have to replace what you used. If you couldn't afford to because you needed to buy the new catalytic converter, and you wanted to wash her car instead, then you needed to TALK TO HER about that and see if she was down with making that trade. Instead, you assumed, you were wrong, and now you're salty at her about it. Not cool", "YTA. You never ever ever borrow a car and leave it on empty outside of an actual emergency, like a heart attack or tornado or a terrorist attack. That's just chow it is. And you KNEW this, but you inexplicably decided to do something unecessary because you just decided \"fuck you\" is guess. IDK what you were thinking but it absolutely wasn't cool. At the very least you should have left the tank at the same level as when you borrowed it. You didn't even do that.", "YTA, you can use a dirty car with petrol in, a sparkling clean one with no petrol is basically the world's most useless paperweight. Looks to me like you made the call that your time and a bit of soap and water might  con her into not noticing that you hadn't replaced what you'd used -or - give you a reason to pretend that it didn't matter that you hadn't replaced what you'd used. You know, just like you're doing here.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve at least thrown in enough gas to cover what you used and then some. I agree not filling it fully if it was already almost empty. But washing her car doesn\u2019t really benefit her all that much.", "YTA, leave it with as much if not more gas then you got it.\nYou're borrowing the car for your own use and left it at under 1/4 left.", "You should have put at least enough gas to cover your trip. Washing it wasn't a good compromise.", "YTA what strikes me is how she offered her car before you even had a chance to ask, meanwhile you\u2019re sitting here doing calculations in order to cheap out on her. Remember how impressed you were at the selflessness of her gesture? Learn from your girlfriend!", "YTA...Its your Girlfriend...fill the damn tank.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve at least replaced the gas that you did use if you couldn\u2019t afford to fill it all the way. The car wash was nice - but what good is a clean car with gas nearly on empty? My only rules for someone borrowing my car is that they replace the gas that they use, and not leave trash in my car. Though I rarely ever let anyone use my car anyway.\n\nEdit: some people saying it\u2019s only a gallon of gas used etc but like\u2026some peoples cars use hella gas for a 20 mile round trip. My car needs a tuneup and it eats hella gas.", "YTA. Car washing is great, but there's a rule of expectation at play here. You used her car, you add gas into the tank, regardless of where it's at. My mom always said if you bring it back fuller then you took it, they will always remember and let you borrow it next time you ask.\n\nHonestly op, you didn't have to fill it all the way up when you use it, but fuller then you got it is nice.  I'd have taken it from it's original 3/4, and put it to 1/2 a tank myself. It's not cool to use someone's vehicle and not replace some gas in the tank.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to fill the tank but you should replace what you used. You should have filled up until she was at half a tank or a little higher.\n\nI get what your intention was with the car wash but your gf would rather have a gas tank. If the car\u2019s been dirty for so long then car washes clearly are not a priority for her.", "YTA. If you borrow someone's car, you replace the gas. That's just common courtesy. You used gas, which is an expensive resource right now.  Washing her car was not an equal favor.", "Did you just leave her having to top up gas first thing when she uses the car?\n\nYTA.", "YTA, at the very least refill to where it was when you borrowed it. She's probably expecting a bit much if she expected you to fill it entirely, but yeah, at least replace what you used. Washing it is not the same, and you know that", "Yta", "Did you at least put back the fuel that you used?", "YTA and you know it. Maybe she was trying to get a full tank of gas out of you. Maybe not. But you still should have replaced what you used.", "You are cheap!!", "You should have put gas in the car when you were done.", "YTA. You could of bunged $10/$20 in the car to cover what you used plus a thank you. \n\nGetting the car washed as a gift is a smack in the face really.", "Typically you'd fill up someone's tank when they let you borrow their car. Slight YTA.", "Replace the gas is the bare minimum. Cleaning is a nice cherry on top, boyfriend-type gesture. \n\nYTA", "How does it feel to lose a girlfriend over some gasoline? If you don\u2019t know yet I bet you will soon!\n\nYTA", "Yta. Washing the car doesn't help her travel further.", "INFO: How many miles to the carwash does your girlfriend\u2019s car get? \n\nJK. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nA car wash is nice, but a dirty car with enough gas to get a person to and from work is nicer.", "You could have put $10 worth", "I wouldn\u2019t give an f about my car being washed. That isn\u2019t necessary for my car to run. Gas is. You used gas, replace what you used. Pretty simple. This reads as you trying to shimmy out of paying for it. YTA", "Always fill the tank. Period.", "You were well intentioned, but did commit a social faux pas. You definitely don't have to fill the tank all the way if you don't use much, and I don't think she's necessarily expecting a literal full tank. This is a communication/expectations error so NAH. Maybe she just doesn't care about how clean the exterior of the car is.\n\nIf you replace the gas you use and she still gets upset *then* she'd be the AH. Also if you had it detailed then the situation would be a little different, but proper detailing costs more than a tank of gas. And she still might prefer having the gas, so that's something you should discuss with her.", "You should have washed her car and at least replaced the gas you used. Just common courtesy.", "I have never heard that you have to completely fill the tank full when borrowing someone's car. You're to replace whatever gas you used.. that's it.\n\nEdit: ESH. You didn't replace the gas used and she expected the tank to be filled completely.", "I'm going ESH. When you borrow something like a car you need to replace, at minimum, the gas you used. I would have put her to 1/2 a tank personally. \n\nYour GF sucks because she's expecting you to fill the car all the way when she left it at around 1/4 tank. She offered the use of the car freely.\n\nYou should have put some gas in the car man. Don't be that dense. You could have taken the bus if money was an issue tbh.", "I love carwashes, but it's risky because some people time those for specific things.\n\nI wouldn't have \"filled it up\" after a 10 mile trip, but I probably would have but in $20. Cover the trip and a little extra as a thank you.\n\nESH. You thought you were being nice ( a car wash is still thoughtful), and she could have been nicer (a thanks, but I prefer gas next time works). Just a matter of communication.", "NTA but I would've put some gas in there not necessarily fill it up.", "Filling the tank was a very high expectation on your gf's part. A clean car is not her top priority. That's your thing. You should have added some gas, but I think she still should have been angry. If gf expected a full tank of gas for a 20 mile round trip, she should have said so before lending out her car. .", "Yeah agreed that it\u2019s excessive to fill the tank when it was around a quarter full and you barely drove it. Maybe put $5-$10 in to replace what you used. Washing it was a really nice gesture too though. The passive aggression she gave sucked. I\u2019d call you TA, but only on the lightest sense since it is commonly expected to replace gas used. I\u2019m more inclined to call her TA for expecting to get a full tank back, almost as if it was divine intervention.", "NTA. I don\u2019t agree with filling a full tank for a quick trip, especially when you were intending on using your own car. But next time, just replace the gas you used.

Especially if the car was washed like a month ago? Where do you live, in the dessert?)", "YTA. You could have just filled it back to 1/4 tank if you were worried about the money.

It's inconsiderate to not match the gas level.", "Yta\n\nYou always replace the gas you use, whether or not you ask for the vehicle, or it is offered, (unless otherwise stipulated).

A clean car won't power the car.", "YTA. \n\nSo instead of topping off the gas that you used you paid for a car wash that is a lower priority than gas/more expensive than topping off the gas knowing she needed to drive it the next day?\n\nWhy go through all these mental gymnastics just to be self righteous? And get an uber next time if you\u2019re concerned about conforming to social etiquette with your partner.", "YTA. It is convention to replace the gas plus a little extra in a car you borrow. Borrowing a friend's car is cheaper and more convenient than rentals, and that's why compensating the gas used plus wear-and-tear is the appropriate response.

(IRS 2022 mileage rate)", "YTA! \n\nWho said you couldn't have filled the tank a little bit- at least up to the point it was when you started driving it??? \n\nGetting the car washed was nice yeah but a clean can can't run on an empty tank", "Who returns a car on empty to a single female?  What if she'd had an emergency and she gets in a car with no gas in it - very rude OP.", "YTA, fill that gas tank and fill it to the top. You're her boyfriend, act like it.", "YTA\u2014 could\u2019ve put the money spent on the car wash in the tank.", "YTA. You didn't have to fill up the whole tank. You could have just put in a small amount to make up for what you used. You washed the car because it was cheaper. She's not going to want to loan her car to you again if you keep refusing to be considerate like you did here.", "YTA. You pick it up on 1/4, bring it back on 1/2. If you had it for a longer time or trip I'd say fill it, but at the very least replace the gas you used plus some. \n\nWashing the car would've been a very nice gesture on top of putting some gas in it.", "Why do people get stuck on all or none in these situations? How about you put $10 worth of gas in the tank and let her know that when you return it? \n\nYTA", "Yta.", "YTA car wash costs what 8 bucks if that. Nope you want the cheap route and know your wrong. Put gas in her car and apologize.", "YTA: you could have at least put $10-$20 in the tank if not filling it all the way.", "YTA. Because, in my opinion, if someone lends me their car, I fill it up. It\u2019s the right thing to do. It is not an economic decision. I don\u2019t care if I drove it 2 miles and it was on E. But that\u2019s me. I\u2019m not suggesting everyone should operate this way, but in your situation, this is a live in girlfriend. Dude. Get it together. I can see where you\u2019re coming from but read the room. This is one of those situations where, if you fill it up, you\u2019re a hero. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re an asshole. There is no in between. People, in general, need to stop breaking everything down to an economic tit for tat. We\u2019re all in this together.", "YTA. The fact that you considered filling it and then decided against it makes this worse. Perhaps if it was an oversight I'd say NTA, but your thought process must have been \"Hmm, the car is almost empty. Shall I fill it? Nah, she can do that herself\".\nWashing the car instead only shows that you understood that you needed to do something as \"payback\", but you decided against actually paying her back, which seems odd to me.", "YTA. Fill the car up with gas because you used it. Wash her car on top of it because you love her.", "YTA\n\nI know you were trying to be nice, but the general expectation is that you'll return the car with a full tank of gas, or at least replace the gas you used if you really can't afford to fill it all the way. If a car runs out of gas, it won't really matter whether it's clean or dirty.", "Replace what you use, at the very least. \n\nWashing the car instead feels judgy, not helpful.\n\nYTA", "NTA. You thought you were doing a good thing and it\u2019s still a nice gesture. I think asking you to fill the entire tank is a bit ridiculous but you should have considered putting in what you used or giving her some money to cover the cost instead. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really a big deal, you live and you learn.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you even used a gallon of gas. I would\u2019ve been ecstatic if my bf got my car washed because I wouldn\u2019t be expecting anything at all in a relationship like that.", "NTA, assuming that girlfriend means partner. I can't imagine getting so upset that $3-5 worth of gas wasn't replaced with my partner. And if she loaned it because she expected you to completely fill the tank.... wow!", "NTA \n\ngive her $5", "NTA, detailing a car is more expensive than gas and if you're in a serious relationship, you don't get hung up on less than a gallon of gas. \n\nMaybe next time just give her the $5.29 for the gallon smh", "NTA. I don't think it's crazy to want your partner to be on your side here. How much gas did you actually use? You could have given her $10 and called it fine. Next time ask first if you can pay her back with a carwash.", "I wouldn\u2019t have filled it up but maybe put $10 of gas in it. Nah", "ESH\n\nYou use someone's car, it's common courtesy to fill the tank, at least a bit (in your situation I would have said until half), you're the first person I ever heard of washing the car instead, and most people don't care about it (like if I polished your door knobs you wouldn't care, yet it's an attention).\n\nShe's in AH territory for expecting a full tank for the 20 miles you drove that day. She should have lent you the car without strings attached if it really was a nice gesture, expecting you to replace what you used at least a bit is normal, but I find lending the car for a small distance and expecting you to fil it doesn't make it so nice (if she was too lasy to do it herself she could have asked).", "Simply for the fact that she OFFERED to let you use her car, I\u2019m going with NTA. When I offer things to people, I do so without expecting anything in return. It is my kind gesture to them, especially because if I\u2019m offering something, like a car in this instance, they\u2019re obviously not in an ideal place and shouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u201csocial faux pas,\u201d but rather taking care of whatever is needing to be taken care of. \n\nIf you would\u2019ve asked to borrow it, yes absolutely fill it up as a thanks. Offering kind things to people while EXPECTING something SPECIFIC in return, especially in a romantic relationship, is a slippery slope towards resentment. Like you said, you\u2019re not in the best place trying to save up money to fix your car. You did what you could to show your gratitude and that should be enough!", "This is why I'm so glad that uk insurance is for drivers and not the car. Never ever have this problem because it's so much more of a pain to lend a car since the borrower has to be added to insurance first. I think washing the car was a decent thing to do. Etiquette is a ball ache, as is washing a car, putting in fuel is not a ball ache", "ESH You should have just replaced the gas you used. Ike 5 buckd thrown in. That's it. But her expecting a full tank makes her a massive AH..\nIt's not your responsibility to fill up her gas tank.", "NTA you\u2019re not a mind reader, she should\u2019ve asked you to fill it up", "ESH.\n\nYou suck for not replacing the gas you used. With gas prices the way they are, replacing what is used is much more helpful than cleaning it.\n\nShe is a major AH for expecting a full tank of gas when you drove a whole 20 miles.", "This.  It's not that he didn't top it off... he left it nearly empty which means she might have unexpectedly have to go to the gas station.   It's not the way to repay the kind gesture that she made. \n\nOP... check out car rental rates then start complaining about paying more for the gas you used...  YTA", "YTA, absolutely agreed, instead of paying for a car wash that money should have gone straight into the tank that way it extends the days before *she* had to spend $50 to fill the tank. Maybe she was automatically assuming you would have filled the tank and I agree that would have been excessive, but you could have at least put $10 in her tank.", "I think when people says \"fill the tank\" they aren't necessarily meaning to literally FILL it, to me it's like put SOME gas in there. If you estimate you spent $10 in gas then put that much back in there. If she still gripes then that's a different ball game.", "Yes, at least put in about as much as you used. A clean car is a \"nice to have\", but gas is a need. You wouldn't get someone a manicure (only) when they're struggling to buy food.\n\nEdit: also I get uncomfortable when my car is below a quarter tank and I don't have an immediate plan to fill it. If it was less than a quarter and I didn't have time to fill it on my next journey (eg: it would make me late for work), it would put unnecessary stress in the back of my mind", "Happy cake day!", "Happy cake day \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf70", "Gas, ass or grass nobody rides for free.", "At a minimum.  Extra as a thank you for letting you borrow the car.  \n\nOP, YTA", "Yeah. Like why? I guess the car wash was much cheaper?", "A car wash is OTT imo but a generous squirt of petrol is a must, preferably more than was used.\n\nBut yeah the OP is the AH.", "Yikes. Why does you car waste so much gas? 20 miles at quarter of a tank and being left at E? That's just bad. My car drives more than 20 miles on one gallon and I have a 13 gallon tank. Being at quarter, I have about 3 to 4 gallons left, after a 20 mile round trip, I'd probably be below the quarter line but definitely not at E with the warning light on.", "He says he didn't put gas in he just go a carwash.", "The road to hell is filled with good intentions \ud83d\ude06", "Except he returned it nearpy empty but took it at a quarter tank. He didn't replace what he used. He just washed it.", "I'm wondering if she offered it knowing it was nearly empty with the expectation that he would fill it up. It is common to fill it up. I personally wouldn't be concerned that my BF didn't if it was just above 1/4 before and just below after. ESH", "Yeah, I mean, if a friend lent me a car when I desperately needed it, I'd likely fill it up.\n\nIf my partner lent me a car to make a short trip, I might put in as much gas as I used.  The idea of filling your partner's car for $50 after a 20-mile drive seems, ummm, over the top.  I mean, if you always split the cost of dates and pay your partner gas money when they drive, maybe.\n\nWashing the car instead of filling it seems pretty okay, although clearly OP's gf feels differently, and OP should keep that in mind in future.", "Exactly. What if she was running late for work the next day? The last thing she\u2019d need is her gas light coming on after kindly letting her bf use the car. It\u2019s stressful driving somewhere with the light on and hoping you don\u2019t run out of gas before you have the chance to get to a station.", "Honestly who thinks washing the car is a better choice than filling what you used? A clean car is great if it can run otherwise it\u2019s just useless", "10$ aint worth the price of a fart anymore. Id have put 20$ in. But ya. Op def YTA in this situation. Gas is way more useful and helpful than washing a car.", "The post is unclear whether he took it to a car wash or washed it by hand, so he might've done it by hand to save money.", "Same. When I was in high school my boyfriend's sister ran out of gas while driving me home, and it was late, all the gas stations were closed, I actually forget what we ended up doing but it was so stressful for everyone involved, I think it's a big reason why I start looking for a convenient gas station when my tank is less than half full.\n\nThankfully, my husband uses my car a lot in the winter to run errands and get to his curling matches, so he usually fills the tank before I have a chance to worry.", "It seems to me that he washed it himself, he didn\u2019t pay to get it washed. But I could be incorrect. Edit: I read it wrong, I do think he paid to have it washed", "Yeah I would love it if someone got my car washed, truly. But I don't need the car wash to use my car, I need fuel. OP should have at least replaced the gas, and if able, throw in the car wash as an extra thank you gesture since the gf was doing something nice for him.", "YTA then OP. You might not have been financially able to fill the tank but not even replacing the fuel that you used? Replacing is a no brainer. You shouldn't have used the car then.\n\nEdited.\n\nThanks @Moon-Queen95", "Unless she drives a hummer, he didn't use a quarter of a tank going 20 miles.", "You're right! I'll edit my judgement.", "Exactly how I feel!", "I don't think I've ever actually washed my car lol. It rains a lot where I live so I just count that. I'd 100% rather someone put $20 worth of gas in.", "The point is he didn't replace the gas he used which is the bare minimum when borrowing someone's car. You never return a car with less gas in it then what was there when you took it. You top it back up to where it was or give them cash in lieu of gas to compensate what was used."]}
