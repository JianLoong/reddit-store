{"id": 3064, "submission_id": "z2scdz", "title": "AITA for not filling the gas tank in my girlfriend's car?", "selftext": "Early this past weekend, the catalytic converter from my car was stolen while I was at work. I had made plans to go to my mom's house towards the end of the weekend to help with some chores and spend an afternoon with her. Before I even asked my girlfriend if I could borrow her car in order to go to my mom's house, she had offered to let me use her car for the day, saying she wouldn't need it that day. Super nice of her, and I was very grateful.\n\nWhen I get in her car to go to my mom's house, I notice the gas tank is just over a quarter full - plenty to get to my mom's house as it is about 10 miles away. Since my girlfriend was kind and let me borrow my car, I wanted to help in some way, so instead of filling the tank, I had her car washed instead. It had been at least a month since she last had her car washed, and I spent more time washing her car than I normally spend washing my own. I take the car to my mom's, bring it back and return the keys to my girlfriend, and I thought that would be it.\n\nFast forward to last night, my girlfriend and I are coming home from dinner with her parents, with us driving her car (since mine is still at the mechanic's). She makes a sarcastic comment at some point along the lines of \"Oh, thanks for filling up my car when you used it a few days ago.\" I mention to her that instead of filling up the tank, I washed her car as a way of saying thank you for letting me borrow it. She replies with \"Thanks, but normally when someone borrows someone else's car, they fill it up when they're done. And you left me nearly on empty.\" I responded with \"I understand that's normally what people do, but since I only used it for one trip, and since you were already pretty low when I needed to use it, I didn't think I should have to fill nearly your entire tank (probably about $50). And when I got home, the gauge said just under a quarter tank, plenty to get you to work and back the next day. That's why I washed it instead.\" She replies \"Well in the future, if you need to borrow my car, please fill it when you're done.\" Wanting to avoid arguing, I just said \"Okay, will do\" and left it at that. \n\nWe didn't go to bed that night angry or anything, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. I fully acknowledge that the convention when borrowing a car is to fill the tank up when you return it, but the reasons I didn't think that necessary/justified in this situation: 1) I only needed it one trip on one day for a few hours, a total of no more than 20 miles. 2) I had it washed instead, still spending time and money on it to show my appreciation. 3) Filling up the tank all the way would have cost much more than the gas that I used, and with having to buy a new catalytic converter for my own car, I'm trying to be careful with money for the next month or two.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669218106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2scdz/aita_for_not_filling_the_gas_tank_in_my/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can wash a car anytime and even for free if you do it at home but gas you have to goto a station and to pay for it! So yes gas wouldve been a bigger deal you shouldve atleast put in another quarter so that wouldve been like your quarter to use also +10 miles is still a long distance to drive but thats not really relevant", "YTA - she does a favor for you, you choose to inconvenience her further and cost her money. A dirty car still gets you to work, no gas doesn\u2019t. She also didn\u2019t explicitly ask you to fill the entire tank up, so based off how you and she phrased this, I think her point was you added no gas, not that you didn\u2019t fill the whole tank up. \n\nCommon courtesy is at minimum fill the tank to where you left it, normally a smidge extra for inconveniencing them.", "YTA Assholes take and don't give back. Washing the car is an empty gesture designed to make you look and feel better in this situation.", "Replacing what you used isn\u2019t a \u201cway to say thank you.\u201d It\u2019s the bare minimum required to be allowed to borrow her car you weirdo.

You don't need to *fill* the tank (I have never hear of that, especially when the fuel gauge is below half), but $10 worth of gas would have been good, and you probably spent that much at the car wash. if you drove 20 miles, assuming her car gets 20mph, $10 would have more than replaced what you used.", ">Since my girlfriend was kind and let me borrow my car, I wanted to help in some way, so instead of filling the tank, I had her car washed instead.\n\nYTA.  \n\n>1) I only needed it one trip on one day for a few hours, a total of no more than 20 miles.\n\nSo put less than a full tank in it.\n\n>2) I had it washed instead, still spending time and money on it to show my appreciation.\n\nTo people who don't care, that's just wasted time and money.

Gas is expensive, and probably way more important to her than a cleaning.", "What would it have cost to rideshare or taxi to your Mom's? That's the LEAST you should have put in the tank.

Washing the car is not nice if your girlfriend has to unexpectedly rush to the gas station.", "YTA, the rule of thumb when you borrow something is to return it in as good or better condition than when you got it. Washing it was nice, but you forgot to replace what you consumed. You didn't need to fill the tank, but you should have returned it with at least the same amount as when you borrowed it. Doing so shows that you respect her time and money.", "YTA. \n\nSure you didn't need to fully fill her tank if you took it 20 miles, but you made it so she had to get gas right away to use her own car. \n\nIf she had a quarter of a tank and you used the car to go 20 miles, you likely left the tank on E (not that it was out of gas, just that it was at the warning light level or close to it). You could have at least put $15 worth of gas in the car so she didn't have to worry about gas as soon as she used the car. \n\nWhen you borrow something, you should never give it back worse off than it was when you got it. In this case, that's exactly what you did. She didn't need a clean car, she needed a car with gas in it. You did something that was free to you and decided it was better than giving her money, and you know that isn't true. A clean car without gas in it is inferior to a dirty car with gas in it.", "I get that you\u2019re tight on money, but replace the gas you used is the bare minimum.", "Gas makes car go. No gas, no go. Big inconvenience.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, YTA. You had issues with your car, and she let you borrow hers. The money for the car wash would have been much better spent on gas (especially with current prices) since you used it.", "YTA. You did not have to fill the car but you could have put a quarter tank of gas in so she wasn\u2019t on empty.", "YTA. You took her car, which had quarter a tank of gas and returned it on nearly empty. This is a big annoyance since she now had to take the time out of her day after being caught off guard that she had no gas to get anywhere after you used it all. Her not washing her car shows its not a priority to her. You were being a cheapskate. You should have at least put her gas back on a quarter full. If it was me, I'd never let you use my car again.", "YTA. Given the fact you said that it would be probably $50 to fill up (gas station prices vary this as well), your girlfriends vehicle is probably about the size of a SUV if not bigger (basing this off the size of my own vehicle which is anywhere between 30-45 to fill). At a minimum put in 10 dollars worth of gas, which depending on the vehicle would put the gas gauge at halfway between half and empty.  My neighbor doesn\u2019t drive, instead if she needs to go to the store and I\u2019m available she gives me gas money in order to help replace the gas that was used to drive her to the store (half the time my car is full and I use the money to pay for food during the work week).", "YTA. You don't have to fill it up but you absolutely have to replace what you used. If you couldn't afford to because you needed to buy the new catalytic converter, and you wanted to wash her car instead, then you needed to TALK TO HER about that and see if she was down with making that trade. Instead, you assumed, you were wrong, and now you're salty at her about it. Not cool", "YTA. You never ever ever borrow a car and leave it on empty outside of an actual emergency, like a heart attack or tornado or a terrorist attack. That's just chow it is. And you KNEW this, but you inexplicably decided to do something unecessary because you just decided \"fuck you\" is guess. IDK what you were thinking but it absolutely wasn't cool. At the very least you should have left the tank at the same level as when you borrowed it. You didn't even do that.", "YTA, you can use a dirty car with petrol in, a sparkling clean one with no petrol is basically the world's most useless paperweight. Looks to me like you made the call that your time and a bit of soap and water might  con her into not noticing that you hadn't replaced what you'd used -or - give you a reason to pretend that it didn't matter that you hadn't replaced what you'd used. You know, just like you're doing here.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve at least thrown in enough gas to cover what you used and then some. I agree not filling it fully if it was already almost empty. But washing her car doesn\u2019t really benefit her all that much.", "YTA, leave it with as much if not more gas then you got it.\nYou're borrowing the car for your own use and left it at under 1/4 left.", "You should have put at least enough gas to cover your trip. Washing it wasn't a good compromise.", "YTA what strikes me is how she offered her car before you even had a chance to ask, meanwhile you\u2019re sitting here doing calculations in order to cheap out on her. Remember how impressed you were at the selflessness of her gesture? Learn from your girlfriend!", "YTA...Its your Girlfriend...fill the damn tank.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve at least replaced the gas that you did use if you couldn\u2019t afford to fill it all the way. The car wash was nice - but what good is a clean car with gas nearly on empty? My only rules for someone borrowing my car is that they replace the gas that they use, and not leave trash in my car. Though I rarely ever let anyone use my car anyway.\n\nEdit: some people saying it\u2019s only a gallon of gas used etc but like\u2026some peoples cars use hella gas for a 20 mile round trip. My car needs a tuneup and it eats hella gas.", "YTA. Car washing is great, but there's a rule of expectation at play here. You used her car, you add gas into the tank, regardless of where it's at. My mom always said if you bring it back fuller then you took it, they will always remember and let you borrow it next time you ask.\n\nHonestly op, you didn't have to fill it all the way up when you use it, but fuller then you got it is nice.  I'd have taken it from it's original 3/4, and put it to 1/2 a tank myself. It's not cool to use someone's vehicle and not replace some gas in the tank.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to fill the tank but you should replace what you used. You should have filled up until she was at half a tank or a little higher.\n\nI get what your intention was with the car wash but your gf would rather have a gas tank. If the car\u2019s been dirty for so long then car washes clearly are not a priority for her.", "YTA. If you borrow someone's car, you replace the gas. That's just common courtesy. You used gas, which is an expensive resource right now.  Washing her car was not an equal favor.", "Did you just leave her having to top up gas first thing when she uses the car?\n\nYTA.", "YTA, at the very least refill to where it was when you borrowed it. She's probably expecting a bit much if she expected you to fill it entirely, but yeah, at least replace what you used. Washing it is not the same, and you know that", "Yta", "Did you at least put back the fuel that you used?", "YTA and you know it. Maybe she was trying to get a full tank of gas out of you. Maybe not. But you still should have replaced what you used.", "You are cheap!!", "You should have put gas in the car when you were done.", "YTA. You could of bunged $10/$20 in the car to cover what you used plus a thank you. \n\nGetting the car washed as a gift is a smack in the face really.", "Typically you'd fill up someone's tank when they let you borrow their car. Slight YTA.", "Replace the gas is the bare minimum. Cleaning is a nice cherry on top, boyfriend-type gesture. \n\nYTA", "How does it feel to lose a girlfriend over some gasoline? If you don\u2019t know yet I bet you will soon!\n\nYTA", "Yta. Washing the car doesn't help her travel further.", "INFO: How many miles to the carwash does your girlfriend\u2019s car get? \n\nJK. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nA car wash is nice, but a dirty car with enough gas to get a person to and from work is nicer.", "You could have put $10 worth", "I wouldn\u2019t give an f about my car being washed. That isn\u2019t necessary for my car to run. Gas is. You used gas, replace what you used. Pretty simple. This reads as you trying to shimmy out of paying for it. YTA", "Always fill the tank. Period.", "You were well intentioned, but did commit a social faux pas. You definitely don't have to fill the tank all the way if you don't use much, and I don't think she's necessarily expecting a literal full tank. This is a communication/expectations error so NAH. Maybe she just doesn't care about how clean the exterior of the car is.\n\nIf you replace the gas you use and she still gets upset *then* she'd be the AH. Also if you had it detailed then the situation would be a little different, but proper detailing costs more than a tank of gas. And she still might prefer having the gas, so that's something you should discuss with her.", "You should have washed her car and at least replaced the gas you used. Just common courtesy.", "I have never heard that you have to completely fill the tank full when borrowing someone's car. You're to replace whatever gas you used.. that's it.\n\nEdit: ESH. You didn't replace the gas used and she expected the tank to be filled completely.", "I'm going ESH. When you borrow something like a car you need to replace, at minimum, the gas you used. I would have put her to 1/2 a tank personally. \n\nYour GF sucks because she's expecting you to fill the car all the way when she left it at around 1/4 tank. She offered the use of the car freely.\n\nYou should have put some gas in the car man. Don't be that dense. You could have taken the bus if money was an issue tbh.", "I love carwashes, but it's risky because some people time those for specific things.\n\nI wouldn't have \"filled it up\" after a 10 mile trip, but I probably would have but in $20. Cover the trip and a little extra as a thank you.\n\nESH. You thought you were being nice ( a car wash is still thoughtful), and she could have been nicer (a thanks, but I prefer gas next time works). Just a matter of communication.", "NTA but I would've put some gas in there not necessarily fill it up.", "Filling the tank was a very high expectation on your gf's part. A clean car is not her top priority. That's your thing. You should have added some gas, but I think she still should have been angry. If gf expected a full tank of gas for a 20 mile round trip, she should have said so before lending out her car. .", "Yeah agreed that it\u2019s excessive to fill the tank when it was around a quarter full and you barely drove it. Maybe put $5-$10 in to replace what you used. Washing it was a really nice gesture too though. The passive aggression she gave sucked. I\u2019d call you TA, but only on the lightest sense since it is commonly expected to replace gas used. I\u2019m more inclined to call her TA for expecting to get a full tank back, almost as if it was divine intervention.", "NTA. I don\u2019t agree with filling a full tank for a quick trip, especially when you were intending on using your own car. But next time, just replace the gas you used.

Especially if the car was washed like a month ago? Where do you live, in the dessert?)", "YTA. You could have just filled it back to 1/4 tank if you were worried about the money.

It's inconsiderate to not match the gas level.", "Yta\n\nYou always replace the gas you use, whether or not you ask for the vehicle, or it is offered, (unless otherwise stipulated).

A clean car won't power the car.", "YTA. \n\nSo instead of topping off the gas that you used you paid for a car wash that is a lower priority than gas/more expensive than topping off the gas knowing she needed to drive it the next day?\n\nWhy go through all these mental gymnastics just to be self righteous? And get an uber next time if you\u2019re concerned about conforming to social etiquette with your partner.", "YTA. It is convention to replace the gas plus a little extra in a car you borrow. Borrowing a friend's car is cheaper and more convenient than rentals, and that's why compensating the gas used plus wear-and-tear is the appropriate response.

If you didn\u2019t want to fill it, you could have put 20$ and that would have covered the 20miles round trip you used, and gave her more gas.", "YTA- you are in need of transportation, and she graciously allowed to use her vehicle. Have you seen the price of gas lately? If she was truly under a quarter of a tank, you probably could\u2019ve thrown 20 bucks in it to replenish what you used and not left her at near empty.", "YTA.  What if your girlfriend had to be at work early, then found out she had to make a stop and fill the gas tank?  While all your labor washing her car counts in your favor, with gas prices as high as they are, you should have had the common sense to fill the tank.  She did you a BIG favor, and you blew it.  You owe her flowers and a bottle of wine and a full tank of gas.", "YTA in that washing the car vs putting gas in it was the wrong choice. But your gf is being an AH in expecting a full tank. Do you think she specifically suggested you borrow it because she thought she would get free gas out of it?", "YTA you didn't need to fill it up but you should replace what you used, especially if it's low to begin with", "NTA.  The girlfriend volunteered for you to borrow the car which was only 1/4 full and expected you to fill it up?  Sounds like unrealistic expectations.  Plus you are dating and you had an emergency.  Seems like people expect their significant others to fill their tanks if they use what is probably less than a gallon of gas, seems awfully transactional for a romantic relationship.", "Yta.\n\nSorry can\u2019t you just fill what you have used? Return the car back to her with what she had originally and maybe a little extra?\n\nDepending on the car, consumption of 20miles is not that much, 2-6l? She will also be driving you around because you don\u2019t have a car.. I agree filling from quarter to full is a bit much. But replacing your personal use should be ok.", "YTA\nYes you just used to for 1 day but you were making a 20 mile round trip. There's no rule saying if you put fuel in a car you have to fill it right up. You could have just put a quarter of a tank in and left it at that.\n\nWashing the car instead of replacing the fuel you used wasn't a nice move, it was a cheap move.", "I don't drive or own a car and I know YTA", "YTA it's common knowledge to replace AT LEAST what you use in gas, plus extra if you're able. A clean car won't help her if she is stranded somewhere. Also, those indicator lights aren't 100% accurate. A good bf would have put the tank to at least half full. She offered without you asking, because she sounds like a great gf. Just respect her before you lose her over something stupid.", "YTA your social cues are off to think a car wash was more needed idk sounds strange YTA", "I had the same thought, she volunteered it expecting to get free gas.\n\nI'm going ESH. You don't give a borrowed car back with less gas than it had when you borrowed it, but you also don't loan a car out on empty and have your hand out expecting a full tank back.\n\nI don't let my car sit with less than half a tank anyways... My dad gets very dad-splainy about condensation happening on empty tanks and it's kinda drilled in my head at this point.", "Been scrolling for a while and this is the first NTA I\u2019ve seen. \n\nI agree \u2014 fundamentally it would\u2019ve been better to replace what was used. But the fact that she hadn\u2019t had the car washed in a month implies that she does make a point of getting her car washed, meaning there\u2019s clear value in what OP did. \n\nAlso \u2014 and I\u2019m from UK so potential mismatch here \u2014 but if I drove 20 miles it\u2019d probably cost me \u00a33 (let\u2019s say $3.50). For everyone saying replace what you took \u2014 would you really stop at a station to put in $3.50 of gas? \n\nYou\u2019d maybe put in extra as a nice gesture \u2014 but by extension I\u2019d say that the car wash (which OP\u2019s GF would have paid for) counts as value added.\n\nPlus, she still had gas left. A quarter of a tank here is probably 75 miles (absolute minimum, unless GF drives a Ferrari). \n\nAgree that in the ideal world you\u2019d have replaced the gas used, but come on \u2014 there\u2019s no world in which OP is actually an AH for not doing so.\n\nAlso think the GF is out of line for insisting that if the car\u2019s used in future then the tank must be filled completely. \n\nNTA.", "I think it\u2019s also proportionate to the inconvenience.

She was nice enough to let you borrow her car the least you could do is put gas in it.", "YTA\n\nIt's not just the gas. It's also wear and tear on the vehicle. Your trip added to her cars use, and while it was a kind gesture to wash her car. However, as others have said, the least you should have done is replace the gas you used.\n\nYour gf brought it up as a topic because she was upset about the tank being low. As the convention is to replace the used gas if not fill the tank. \n\nI get gas (and everything) is expensive.  Just don't expect your gf to offer without making sure you will gas up when returning the vehicle (that you are still using).", "YTA\n\nYou used teh car and it's petrol (gas, whatever) replacing it would have been far more courteous. A wash is not a necessity, gas is.\n\n\"Since it was already pretty low when I needed to use it\".... read that again, slowly. Really think about that. Wouldn't filling been better than an unnecessary wash? especially is money is a bit tight. Could have even just replaced quarter or 2 and told her \"Sorry I couldn't fill it but I wanted to leave you with a bit more than you had\" or something.\n\nLook. this really isn't a big deal. But there were better ways to go about it.", "YTA\n\nBasic, common sense, etiquette when borrowing a car.", "Well than that would be ESH, as the gf isn't being reasonable either. Bad judgment, sorry.", "Right?? Not to mention, dude just had his catalytic converter cut out, he\u2019s going to be paying his deductible on insurance at minimum to have it replaced. If your partner goes through that shit, why be petty about $7 worth of gas?\n\nNot to mention they\u2019re partners. With a friend sure I\u2019d pay them, but partners do things for each other", "So she's not an AH for expecting a full tank every time the bf drives her car out of the driveway? Ok", "You\u2019re welcome! You too!", "It hardly rains here, but washing cars is a waste of money and water.", "Salt can't build up if you take your car through the winter car wash and back onto the salty road like a moron! /taps forehead", "My husband's 2007 impala has a 17g gas tank. Costs about $50 to fill from empty where we live."]}
