Do you really get assaulted by your family? You need to get far away from there. Toronto is so expensive, a lot of people from Toronto are moving to Windsor lately. Apartments are way cheaper here and the university has some great programs. We're building a battery plant right now so there's going to be new jobs coming. There's a lot of jobs here especially if you have factory experience. Is saving money more important than your physical and mental safety?\n\nI understand how people don't get sleeping during the day isn't sleeping in, it's just regular sleep because you're at work all night. It sucks when you're not being heard. I don't think it's going to change.\n\nNTA for asking for some basic respect but I don't think you're going to get it. Sometimes you make plans and life gets in the way. Your physical and mental health are important too. You have a strong work ethic that will take you far. No matter what you decide I hope you consider moving far away and just be safe.  I'm here if you ever need to talk.", "INFO: why can everyone have a lock on their door except you?", "NTA. As someone who works nights, I\u2019ve had to set boundaries with my parents on when they can and can\u2019t call me.", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mother and sister come into my room without knocking while I\u2019m sleeping half naked(with my twins put) everyone has a lock on their door expect me, people take my stuff, move my stuff, I\u2019m not allowed to put a lock on the door or the door will be removed. My sister talks extremely loud and it wakes me up, I sleep till about 12pm-1pm and these are the only things that get to me, I asked them calmly to stop and they tell me they don\u2019t want to talk about it or they scream at me to leave them alone because they had a long day, I asked my dad to talk to them because they have no respect for me they treat as subhuman. If my sister is sleeping my mother tells me \u201cyou have to be quiet because your sister is sleeping she had a long day at Starbucks\u201d \u201cyou have to sleep because your dad is sleeping\u201d My dad said that he doesn\u2019t want to walk on eggshells in his house, my dad has never disturbed me I was taking about my mother and sister, he is just so thick and would Not listen to me. I asked him to tell them because they wouldn\u2019t listen to me and this whole thing backfired while I was trying to be mature about the situation and just express calmly how I feel. AITA for requesting the same respect everyone else gets?   I\u2019ve never barged into someone\u2019s room without knocking and asking if I can come in but they don\u2019t give me the same when i ask. I told them I will leave once I make 120k I\u2019m halfway there and then I can pay for school i make 60k a year and it will only take another year.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Time to stop playing nice, as they obviously won't respect you and your dad won't do anything about it. Wake them up when you get home doing the same things they do. \n\nSince you can't put a lock on the door, get a door wedge and use it with the door closed. Tell them if they take your door, you will start buying air horns and setting them off at random times when they are trying to sleep.", "NTA. You are asking for the same respect that others in your family expect from you. It might be worthwhile moving out sooner even if it will delay your plans.", "NTA\n\nBut your story already tells that no one is going to respect your schedule, so get out when you can and leave it all behind.", "NTA, but my two cents is if communication can't solve this problem then your options are live in misery for another year, or move out and either re-arrange your plans, or take more time to reach your monetary goal.", "NTA. I was in a situation like yours and it eventually put me in danger of losing my job outright. Basic courtesy extends to everyone - that's basic. Demand a lock on your door and common courtesy or consider leaving. Do you pay rent/for yourself in any way? Triple the reason then, although you should have been granted basic boundaries by default.\n\nUnfortunately, the brother that violated my boundaries constantly was 1000% the reason I moved out and that sadly may be the only answer in the end.", "NTA\n\nYour family though? Major ahs.", "Thanks for all the comments I don\u2019t use Reddit usually but I don\u2019t have friends to talk to and I don\u2019t have time for therapy, I might try to go but it\u2019s hard I\u2019m really trying to do everything I can to support myself and make sure I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t want to put myself in another shitty situation, living in Toronto is not what I want, I want to be able to make enough money to leave here eventually. You should see the apartments here, it\u2019s like a prison cell lol. Thanks for the suggestions and stories it really helps me out, I really just needed to hear this, I felt alone these past few months.", "NTA but as a long time swing shifter, good luck. For some reason it is acceptable to disrespect the sleep schedule of anyone who dares work anything other than 9-5", "I know I can get a better job and make more money, I\u2019m pretty open to a lot of career options but I was thinking about shooting for investment banking because I\u2019m very obsessive and analyze markets on my personal time for profit. I have a job where they pay my way through uni then have a 2 year contract to  work for them then I can work elsewhere if I do that I can get housing with the money I save up and get into IB. I\u2019ve became cynical to my family situation where money has became my priority and I\u2019ve have not felt more fulfilled with anything else I\u2019ve done. I know it might not make sense to others but I love achieving my goals and working, I\u2019m not really home much so it\u2019s not bad. I just need sleep to preform at work properly.", "I used to borrow my sisters clothes, it was a mutual thing but it was a problem only if I did it. If my sister wore my stuff my parents would turn a blind eye and they got her a lock for her door but my sister did the same and they had no problems even if I did. They have no respect for me and I think they resent me and look at me badly, me and my sister were also mischievous in our teenage years but my sister would tell on me constantly, it would cause me a lot of problems.", "The petty side of me had similar thoughts, but I don't know if that will work in this situation.  I think they understand what they are doing they just don't care, so turning the tables won't fix this.", "They will beat me till I pass out lol but I do love the fantasy of it", "Thanks you this helped. It\u2019s sucks to have people who don\u2019t respect you in your life, especially when it\u2019s your own blood. I don\u2019t pay rent I want to save money because I don\u2019t want to struggle when I leave or take on debt but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it. I love money lol.", "I almost have become cynical to this family which is awful but it\u2019s my way of coping which I guess makes me an asshole but it\u2019s the only way for me at the moment because I really want to reach my goals.", "I get it. Sleep is really important. I should be in bed right now but I don't have to work until 2 tomorrow. My husband lets me sleep, it's my dogs who wake me up. Can't really reason with them. I hope you find the best place for you. Sending you big sister ((hugs)). I hope you succeed in your dreams.", "Are they maybe trying to drive you out?", "I think they have some resentment toward me, I\u2019ve asked them but they won\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on. It really does a number to my self esteem but I\u2019ve become numb to my family situation since I was young. But I like sleep and money, it feels good to get passed certain milestones and achieve goals that I don\u2019t think I will be able to living in Toronto I will be broke.", "Buddy if you are genuinely at risk of assualt, just get out asap.", "I can hardly blame you. I would do what another comment suggested with the wedge if you can't have a lock. It may get ugly but I do feel you have every right to bite back a bit in this scenario! Moving out is EXPENSIVE - gotta weight the pros and cons for sure!", "Thanks I appreciate it, dogs are the best\u2026most of the time lol, thanks for reading and responding it means a lot to me<3", "I would say yes. I told them if they want me out to kick me out, to say they want me to leave, they can\u2019t really do it because I\u2019m Italian and in my culture you can\u2019t really do that without being looked down upon by other family members(aunts, uncles, cousins) , image is very important to Italians.", "I\u2019m trying to do everything in my power and use it as leverage to keep my income and saving up but I don\u2019t know how much longer it will last I can deal with it, I have ways to cope with it but I will fight to keep my income until cops escort me out.", "Oh Toronto...  \n\nOne other thing to consider would be a storage locker for any items you want to keep safe, and maybe occassional stays at a hotel when you need a break / good rest.", "If image is that important, maybe the next time they enter your room you should sit bolt upright and scream something about perverts always in your room trying to see you naked and all. Act half asleep and traumatized. Either do it when other family members are visiting or figure out another way to let them know (first, before mom and sis can make any other claims about what they're doing in your room).", "I have went to hotels some nights, I just try to give them the attitude they want so I can use their car and eat the food in the house, I know it sounds bad but I can\u2019t respect someone who doesn\u2019t respect me back and I feel like I\u2019m pushed into a corner.", "I like this idea lol, I might try this, I wish I didn\u2019t have to play stupid games but it might come to this.", "Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without contacting the mods for approval, including edited versions.

For your own sanity, move.", "That\u2019s fair, I just think if I give them the curtesy of not disturbing them while they sleep, it\u2019s possible for me to get the same. Most of the time the noise does not bother me but the coming in my room to wake me up and the loud talking is the only problem I have,the other things I can deal with just annoyances.when they have a problem and tell me I comply, why can\u2019t I have the same.
