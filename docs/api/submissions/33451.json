Then last year I had my first good birthday where my friends and I actually celebrated, a few of us went out and then went to the spa the next day, and this year I suddenly have Christmas spirit. I\u2019ve been buying presents and saying happy holidays hahaha. From 1 good birthday!!!\n\nYOU DESERVE TO HAVE YOUR BIRTHDAY BE SPECIAL! It would be so sad if your parents\u2019 annoying tradition made it so that you hated your late twin :-(  Birthdays are important. I hope you get to have a good birthday!", "I'm a twin.\n\nYou're NTA. Even had your brother survived and you wanted part of your shared birthday to yourself, you'd still be NTA. Being treated as a set and being forced to share everything sucks - not all twins are the stereotypical \"as close as siblings can be!\" ideal that people expect of twins, and that's for intact twin pairs (I'm NC by choice with my family and it's due in part to the damaging ways my sister and I were raised as twins). You're not being selfish or self-centered in the least. That you're being expected to share your birthday with a sibling that is sadly no longer with the family is dysfunctional. Your parents need help. \n\nI'm glad you have your grandfather and he's made your birthdays special. I hope you managed to have a good day nonetheless.", "NTA.\n\nIf they want to end up losing both kids, then this is the way to do it.\n\nI can't even imagine the pain they've suffered, but to eternally mourn a child they only knew a few hours *at the expense* of a child they've had for 17 years? *They're* the ones being selfish. \n\nA birthday is for the celebration of life, not the grieving of death. They haven't moved on from this death and, from the sound of it, they're not trying to either. *Your* birthday should be about *you* and *your* life. Right now, your grandpa is being more of a parent to you than they are.\n\nHappy birthday \u2764\ufe0f wishing you (and you *alone*) all the joy and happiness in your years to come", "It\u2019s not right they want to celebrate his remembrance during your birthday. And it\u2019s something you should have sat down and really come to an understanding with them on. Knowing how much the death bothered your mom, it\u2019s not right to surprise her with a cake without his candles during the celebration either. What if she saw that and burst out crying on the spot? That would cause another scene and possibly arguments. \n\nI remember when I was ~9, I asked my parents to stop inviting all their friends to my birthday. I didn\u2019t get to invite any of my friends and the only kids there were my parent\u2019s friends\u2019 kids. They used my birthday as a day to party and drink with their friends lol. The presents were plentiful but it wasn\u2019t fun or kid themed at all. Before my birthday party, I told them that they have been inviting their adult friends over to my birthday and how that made me feel. And how I wanted to invite my classmates over this time around. They were quite for some time but never invited their friends again. If they love you, they\u2019ll care if you tell them what they\u2019re doing is hurting you. It\u2019s your day and technically your birthday cake, it\u2019s not fair they have more say on your cake than you do. But know that hurting parents can try to do more for their deceased child to make up for loss memories and fill a void. It\u2019s only right to do the remembrance in the middle of your party if you agree. It\u2019s not really their fault for hurting and wanting to do something but there\u2019s a time and place for everything. I say go back and forgive them and tell them how you feel.", "EDIT: forgot to include NTA\n\nOP, first of all: Happy Birthday. I hope you have time to spend on you.\n\nSecond: like you, I am a younger twin who\u2019s older twin died shortly after birth. I have some thoughts on this.\n\n\nI\u2019ve never known a birthday, graduation, \u201cfirst\u201d experience of any kind that was *mine*. My mother would sink into a crippling depression every time the season changed to [the season of my birthday]. At home any time I started to carve an identity for myself  (grades, activities, etc) they were swiftly met with reminders that they aren\u2019t *mine*, they \u2018should be mine + [dead twin].\u2019\n\n\nThat in itself robs you of your own identity, and forces you into an impossible corner of never being quite allowed to identify positively somewhere. You aren\u2019t ever allowed to be comfortable with being just You. Instead, you are You + Twin. \nThe flip side is: you don\u2019t get to fit into the twin identity bucket either, because well, you don\u2019t have the same twin experience as two living twins. \nYour parents are forcing an unnatural identity on you. And, worse, discouraging you from trying to express your own identity.\n\n\nLike others have said better than I could: that is a major issue that requires addressing. You are your own person and deserve all the experiences that entails.\n\n\nI write to offer caution, in how that can look over time if the forced dynamic remains unchecked. \n\n\nForcing a false identity by your parents, creates a person that does not exist in the real world. Yes, your twin existed. And if your parents believe in an after life, they exist there as well. \nBut, and I don\u2019t mean this with intentional callousness, they do not exist in this world, *as a living sibling* that is sharing events with you. \nLiterally. There is no living twin blowing out those candles with you.\n\nMy grandmother has been dead for years. Most important person in my life. Is she still important to the family? Sure. Is she deserving of honor and remembrance? Of course. Do you still get a cake and expect her to blow out her candles on her birthday? No. Well, Cake, maybe, but nobody is expecting her to come back and blow out candles. \nThere is a place for remembrance. And that does not include acting as if one never died and forcing others to do the same. (Even Weekend at Bernie\u2019s was just the weekend.)\n\n\nCreating and maintaining this nonexistent living person creates an identity you are powerless against. \nIt allows room for the creators of this nonexistent person to define it as they wish. \n\n\nHow can you compete with that? \u201cWhy did you do X?! [dead sibling] would have never done that!\u201d Or \u201c[Dead sibling] would have gotten an A, why did you only get a B?!\u201d\n\n\nI offer this as a gentle validation that, if you ever are in the position that you find yourself competing with this twin you never knew: you ARE enough, and it is not your fault you are put in this impossible position. \n\nAnd, if you ever feel like you are in this between space of not feeling like a (conventional) twin, but don\u2019t feel like a singleton either: you aren\u2019t alone. There are others in that between with you.\n\nAgain, happy birthday!!! \n(And if you ever need to chat, please feel free to reach out!)", "You can be **sad** about the death forever, but *grieving* \\- as in going all Queen Victoria (dressing in black after her husband's death for every day for the rest of her life) is taking it too far.\n\nSadness is eternal.

I hope your parents start to understand the impact it has on you.", "NTA\n\nTell them that for *them* the extra candles create remembrance and honor.\n\nFor *you* it reminds you of a sad loss that overshadows a day you want to enjoy and it makes you sad. \n\nIt's them who need to adjust here.

No problem they will still have her twin. NTA", "The selfish assholes are your parents. They have used your birthday to memorialize the child that didn\u2019t survive. They are ensuring estrangement is in their future because they care more about a baby that died in childbirth then the child that has been alive for 17 years.  It\u2019s selfish and self centered of them to prioritize their unhealed grief  over you. You deserve to be celebrated without it being a memorial for your wombmate. Don\u2019t feel guilty for standing up for yourself. What your parents have done is wrong and cruel. They should be in grief therapy instead making your existence a memorial for your brother.

Never developed a brain enough to experience feelings, or memory, and has no opinions or thoughts about anything. \n\nAnd even if he just passed away, you would STILL deserve to have your own birthday and not be forced to mourn a sibling you never met, have no emotional attachment to, who never even lived a day with you. It's being forced to constantly mourn for a stranger, and one who never even really lived, had a thought, or felt an emotion. I get parents mourning a stillbirth, because they're mourning the loss of those expectations they had, but you would have never even known he existed if they hadn't crammed it down your throat. \n\nYour parents' reaction is ridiculous, and them forcing you to continuously mourn a stranger you never met is ridiculous and abusive. If they want to do some big gesture of mourning, they can (but better that they get therapy), but they don't get to force anyone else to be involved. \n\nNTA", "NAH. \n\nMan this is a crazy one. I have a twin, and also my wife and I have had some losses. \n\nYou are right, they should not mess up your birthday. \n\nThat said, and you don\u2019t need to be the one to deal with this but it\u2019s worth understanding that it\u2019s real, your birthday reminds them of losing a child. That is super hard to deal with. My wife and I were going through stuffed animals recently to cut down on how many we have and my 5 year old said let\u2019s get rid of this one and my wife broke down because they gave us that teddy bear at the hospital when we lost a baby. Obviously my 5 year old doesn\u2019t understand that so nobody is mad at her, but it\u2019s still not fun and we cried about it. \n\nThere isn\u2019t always a perfect answer to things in life like people want there to be, sometimes things suck. \n\n I guess if I were to give in advice here in a tough situation, find a way early on for your birthday to acknowledge your parents legitimate feelings so they can handle that each time instead of pretending it isn\u2019t real, then once you have done that then hopefully you can move on to having the rest of the time about you.", "Every milestone you hit is gonna be bittersweet for your parents because it\u2019s gonna be amazing for them to see you grow and accomplish things but it\u2019s also gonna be a hard hit that your brother is supposed to be there with you but isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting your birthday to just be about you. But you should try to consider that the extra candles and five minutes spent openly thinking about your brother and sharing their grief probably makes it a little easier for your parents. I don\u2019t blame you for not feeling anything towards your brother; you had no time with him. Your parents spent nine months growing him along side you and planning for a future with two kids not one, just to have that ripped from them. Neither you nor I can possibly imagine the kind of pain losing a child causes. \n\nIf I were you, I would suck it up for one more year. You\u2019re old enough that it won\u2019t be long before you won\u2019t be celebrating your birthday with your family but with your friends.

You will have plenty of chances to celebrate your birthday with friends and your future family who will make it all about you.

Their baby lived on that day - and that day only. What they lost was what they never gained. And every time you aged away from your twin, they tried to hold on tighter to him.\n\nMy son had a twin who died in the womb. I\u2019ve been really lucky to be in a place where I could understand and process this grief in a healthy way. My son has always known - but only so that he could understand how he came to be, and that it would never be a shock to learn it all at once one day. As a parent it has been enormously challenging to process death and life - lost love and the joy of living all at once.\n\nYou\u2019re not supposed to carry their grief. What is difficult for parents isn\u2019t supposed to be difficult for children - we should work through what we find tough and carve a way to make it easier for our children. I\u2019m so sorry they\u2019ve put too much on you.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t fix it - it\u2019s their job. But then, they\u2019ve not sorted it out in such a long time if you and your grandad are able for it you might be able to find a way through. \n\nI imagine your parents want 1 -A physical reflection of some kind on your birthday/your twin\u2019s birthday. 2 - they want to feel that you won\u2019t forget your twin (who you never really knew)\n\nIt might help to explain to your parents that now you\u2019re old enough, you would like to help them remember your brother in a new way. When you grow up and get married - your spouse will hardly put candles on your cake for your sibling.  Be clear that the candle habit suits only your parents - and not you. How can they honour their lost child, and how can you join them? When you grow up and move away - how will they mark the occasion? \n\nOf course you shouldn\u2019t have to do this - but sometimes in life we get what we need by doing someone else\u2019s work - if you\u2019re able for it. My mum is similarly difficult - as she\u2019s religious I would offer an hour out of my birthday to go with her to a religious service.

I do this privately because I don\u2019t want my son to feel like his birthday makes me sad. All his firsts have been tinged with sadness but I worked so hard that he didn\u2019t and still doesn\u2019t know (he\u2019s 20 now). The what ifs are hard but my son will never be made to feel less than or a reminder of a sad time. I celebrate both of them and they both know they are loved and cherished.

But, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only the candles that are causing problems. I think (not know) that your parents may make your birthday all about your brother.

This whole issue is mostly a matter of perspective. To the parents it will always be the day they lost a child, as well as the say they gained one. They want and/or feel obligated to acknowledge both. OP is completely justified in wanting a celebration that is not also a memorial service, and her parents need to understand the day doesn't have the same meaning for their child as it does for them.

I definitely empathise with her and hope her 17th birthday will mark a change.\n\nI also think that if her parents are still this affected, they need therapy. The loss of a child is traumatic and I don't want to downplay it as I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but it has been seventeen years. There is no good way of saying this, but after such a long time, it feels more like a traditionalised display of their grief than something that is actually about the brother.\n\nAnd especially when OP was young....

Dead siblings and dead children are depressing. But that's the reality of the situation. OP has a dead sibling, and their parents have a dead child.

If anything, it sounds much more like the parents see her lost brother as an *equal* than a golden child. That's an issue as well: this twin never lived much, built no story, and he's *not equal* to the child that is alive and has feelings. We don't need to extrapolate \"they treat as if the twins are equals when one surely isn't\" to \"they treat the twins as a dead golden child and an alive spare\".
