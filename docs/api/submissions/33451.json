My brother died hour's after birth. He was 5 minutes older then me. I was told my mother went into deep depression, but with help got better over time. I've watched videos of my birthdays from 1-6 year old, and me sharing my birthday with my brother has started at my 1rst birthday. There's always that 5 minutes of remembrance in honor of him, and instead of having one candle on my cake there will be an extra or extras for him. For example, if I was 1 year, there will be 1 for him or if I was 2, then they would add another 2 and so on.\n\n\nAs a kid, I didn't really understand or minded, because I got to blow out extra candles. When I was 8, I did question it and they told me it was in remembrance for my brother since we share the same birthday. This carried on until my 16th, that I didn't get to celebrate, because I ended up in hostpital. My grandpa showed up at the hostpital while I was recovering with a gift and wished me and only me a happy birthday. After he left, I realized, I loved that he only acknowledged me. I realized, I didn't want to keep sharing my birthday with my brother. But then I felt guilty. I did try and speak to my parents about me just me celebrating my birthday this year. But I was brushed off. \n\nNow we come to what happened 4 days ago and my grandpa, who is the official cake maker in my family, asked what type of cake did I want? I told him and added firmly with only 17 candles please. My parent's were in the next room and immediately they came in demanding to know what I was doing? That I should know that the other 17 candles were for my brother and I ended up crying and told them, that he's not even here and I am. I can't remember everything that was said but there was alot shouting with me and my parent's and grandpa and me getting told that I'm selfish and I need to stop being self-centered. Grandpa left with me. I've at his house since the big fight. I've been crying alot and Grandpa been here for me, but I feel so guilty and to need to ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1703118152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n9lp5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_birthday_with_my/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents need to realise you have the right to celebrate without being held back by grief. They need to understand that moving forward from the grief doesn't mean forgetting him.", "NTA\n\nThis ghost-baby-birthday bullshit is **abusive**. It should have *never* happened, let alone for the years and YEARS it did.\n\nYour mom needs to sort her feelings out such that she can put this ancient trauma to rest.\n\n> I ended up crying and told them, that he's not even here and I am\n\nWorse, he was **never** *really* here. Your parents are mourning lost potential, rather that celebrating your actual existence.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents need to find another way to grieve their lost child. Your birthday should be *your* celebration, not *their* occasion to memorialize their grief.\n\nThey need to be able to celebrate you -- their living child -- and find another way to memorialize your brother a different way.", "NTA - your parents need to grieve in a way that doesnt effect you. it doesnt seem they want to realize there\u2019s little grief to feel for someone you didnt meet and having sympathy for your parents is the only way to accept it, but eventually, like grief, has an end or a healthy output.", "NTA\n\nHave them light a candle at a church or plant a tree in his memory?", "Oh honey... No. YOU are not the one who's being selfish here. Your parents absolutely are, and this is not healthy. You are absolutely NTA to want your parents to focus on you for once in your life without putting an asterisk on your life.", "NTA. Birthdays are meant for the living, not the dead. Your parents need to let go of what was and could've and focus on what is right in front them. A daughter that may very well cut ties with them if they continue down this road.", "NTA and they need therapy.", "The whole cake thing is super morbid. Your parents are dragging your special day into THEIR grief problems.\n\nYou have every right to have a boundary around lots appropriate for your celebration.\n\nI hope they get therapy. It really sucks they are giving you a nasty attitude about it. NTA", "NTA,  and you're not selfish but your parents are and have been for your entire life. Losing a child is an unimaginable pain, but forcing a child who has no memory of or connection to a sibling to 'share' their life is cruel and sick. They should have been in therapy until they could find a way to grieve without dragging you down.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to have your own identity. Poor one or share a moment of silence, fine. But you are your own person and should be celebrated as such.", "NTA because it's fair to want your own cake.\n\nHave you considered suggesting there is another way to remember him that is separate from your celebration?", "I understand this, I share a birthday with my grand aunt, who I never meet, she died before I was born, but she was apparently everyone favorite.

On one hand, your parents honouring a child they lost is completely valid, and maybe to them and even me, asking you to blow out extra candles is not a big ask. But you have no attachment to this brother you did not get to meet and you're the living child seemingly asked to carry his memory. It's not fair to call you self-centered when there's no way you could understand your parents' grief of losing a child and you have valid feelings too but at the same time you maybe should understand that this isn't about you or for you or even for your brother, it's for your parents. \n\nI think there's NAH and you should try to apologise to your parents for springing that on them and then try to explain to them without throwing blame how sharing your birthday makes you feel.", "It's your parents who are being selfish. They are forcing their grief on you and that's not fair. NTA", "As it stands right now I\u2019m going YTA but it seems like we\u2019re missing a TON of the story.

Only 1 more year and you can tell them to shove it. Tell them they will loose you as they continue to put a dead person above you. As a grandparent I am disgusted with their behaviour.", "NTA\n\nYour parents haven\u2019t gotten over the tragic death, and they can\u2019t put you on the spot EVERY YEAR OF YOUR EXISTENCE \u2026 this borders on unhinged.\n\nWhat will they do at your graduation?\n\nYour wedding?\n\nThey need therapy and I\u2019m glad your grandfather has given you a safe space. \n\nA happy 17th birthday to you", "I was going to ask about this. Why don't they do a separate cake for the twin for this purpose?", "Exactly. If he had lived, they would have shared birthdays until they decided not to. This is normal. I feel bad for the parents, but they have lost touch.", "OP said they tried to bring it up and was dismissed. How is that blindsiding?", "OP tried to do this a year ago, after her grandfather focused only on her birthday while she was in the hospital. \n\n> I did try and speak to my parents about me just me celebrating my birthday this year.

Jfc", "It's wildly insensitive to say that OP's brother was \"never really here\" or a \"ghost baby.\" He was born, cried, held in the arms of his parents for hours after birth. \n\nOP is definitely NTA but this isn't abusive. OP's parents need grief counseling and a new way to memorialize their lost child that doesn't impact OP's birthday.", "This is not abuse.", "Wow you are awful. Losing a child is a terrible loss. The parents need to handle it differently for sure, but your comments are deeply dismissive and insensitive.", "Bullshit. It's not abusive. And not a ghost baby. It's insensitive,  selfish, and oppressive but not abusive. And he was here. He was born alive.

Yes.", "They don't realize that what they are doing has been hurtful to their living child and that was not their intention. They may hear her voice complaints to them trying to get them to understand but it has not yet been understood. They do owe her an apology but I don't see their offense as being as grievous as you do. I don't think OP necessarily owes them an apology, but like I said, it could open the door to them hearing her out as they feel wronged as well.", "Fair point, forgot that was in there. But again, I don't think anyone is the asshole here. Her parents just may be more open to listening to what she has to say if she apologizes in general.", "*tell me you've never lost a baby without telling me you've never lost a baby* \n\nFor fucks sake man, it is TRAUMA. Yes, the parents need grief counseling but don't put a timeline on recovering from grief or DIMINISH the severity of the loss because of how long the baby lived."]}
