He took her and drove to the doctors office. I went with them as well\n\nApparently she was feeling sick and when she saw me busy she called her dad.

Other parents are here complaining that their children arent talking to them. She will remeber that you find her annoying and dont want to talk.", "YTA.\n\nYou've mentioned that co-parenting has been difficult for you, but have you thought how difficult it is for your little one? \n\nYou got triggered because of the noise levels. Fair enough. What makes you the AH is how you reacted to that. Your kid didnt do anything wrong, she came to tell you something, and in your overwhelmed state you yelled at her and lost the opportunity to help her when she's sick. \n\nWhy didnt you go to her latter to see what she wanted?\n\nNow, first of all, you need to look after your mental health. Its not fair to your kids to have their parent snapping at them left and right. Look into therapy or life coaching.\n\nThen, go to your little one and apologise for how you handled the situation, and explain to her that you will actively try to be better and how.\n\nThink of the type of relationship you want to have with your kids. If you want to be the angry parent, ok. Just dont complain latter when they distance themselves from that toxicity. If you want them to come to you in their time of need, then be better.", "YTA. Based on your responses so far, it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re incredibly defensive when it comes to valid criticisms about how you\u2019re treating your daughter and that you have no interest in changing because you\u2019d rather blame her father/her/find excuses to justify yourself. Nevertheless, here\u2019s the simple truth: children are extremely sensitive to their parents\u2019 moods and perceived rejection. More importantly, over time, a child\u2019s feeling of rejection by a parent turns into a lack of trust and confidence in that caregiver. THAT is why she went to her dad after you snapped at her. \n\nHas it ever occurred to you that the reason *why* your daughter talks \u201cconstantly\u201d is because she\u2019s desperate for *your* attention and affection? Look at your own post. Your day was spent focusing on your son and on your youngest daughter, but when your oldest came to you, did you even give her 30 seconds of your time? No. You snapped at her and made it clear that cooking dinner was more important than what she had to say. It doesn\u2019t matter that you went to her later to ask what was wrong because the damage had been done: you\u2019d already made it clear that compared to her siblings and dinner, she\u2019s not a priority to you. It also doesn\u2019t matter that you asked her, \u201cIs it important?\u201d I can just imagine the tone you used with her and it likely indicated that you didn\u2019t expect her to have anything important to say. *You* made her feel too uncomfortable/unimportant to tell you the truth at that point because she knew you were already irritated and probably figured you wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nWhether you want to admit it or not, a 12 year old is still a child who\u2019s dependent on their parents. Your child came to you and you decided she was too annoying to deal with. Sort your attitude out and be better to her. Or, keep going as you are but understand that in a few years, your daughter won\u2019t come to you for anything at all.", "You know why you didn\u2019t know she was sick? Because you took your bad day out on her and yelled at her to go away. You are exasperated, have your hands full, and your daughter is a \u201cmini me\u201d of her dad\u2026I\u2019m betting you snap at her this way often. You should be apologizing to your daughter for taking your bad day out on her, and reassure her that she can and should tell you things, especially when she is sick. Take a parenting class or anger management class, learn to meditate, or see a counselor. YTA.", "Your attitude of she's not your only kid, she knows that.  She knows you have 2 kids, she had no choice in that.  It's quite obvious but what you could at least do is at least pay attention and not take being a mother if three out on your oldesr daughter and expecting her to behave a certain way to make your life better.  Shes a child that you are teaching to be quiet, be seen but not heard and quite frankly I wouldn't fault her dad for being protective.\n\nYou need a reality check.", "YTA don\u2019t worry she won\u2019t want to talk to you anymore very soon", "YTA\n\nDo you even love your daughter?\n\nThe way you talk about it makes it sound like she's some random annoying unrelated kid that you must keep at your home for some reason.", "YTA.\nOh no. A 12 year old talks a lot. What a horror /s.\n\nGet over yourself. You dismissed your own child when she was trying to tell you something because you had a 'bad day'.\n\nYou just showed her that she is at the bottom of your list. Good job 'mom'.", "YTA. Your daughter did nothing wrong. Ultimately if you are too busy to care for her, which you clearly are, her father is absolutely right to take her back with him.\n\nIf you don't want to alienate your daughter, stop blaming your ex and reflect on your own behaviours. What could you do to strengthen than bond? Clue: it's not snapping at your kid when they're trying to get your attention.", "Well, everyone get overwhelmed, lose their temper, unknowingly neglect the people whom they love sometime\u2026 this is part of being human. We make amends and make up for our mistakes and move on.\n\nBut the way you talk about your daughter really worries me! I feel great resentment, and maybe even blame. You think she is too demanding and might manipulate you and her father? Well guess what\u2026 she is close to her teenage years, child of divorce (and looks like a very toxic one), less than ideal living situation, and also a CHILD!\n\nSo i don\u2019t really put much weight on this isolated incident\u2026 I think YTA.", "YTA there was no reason what so ever for you to snap at her other that she is talkative which is normal for most girls. Cooking is also not an excuse. I hope her father gets full custody.", "YTA\n\nAll parents snap every now and then. But if you're a good parent, kids understand when you snap at them because you're tired or stressed out. They may be a bit hurt, but they know it's not a regular thing and they forgive. Trust is not affected, they know they can still rely on their parents.\n\nBased on the fact your daughter doesn't trust you and refused to tell you about the issue when she was asked later, I think she gets snapped at so regularly that she didn't even want to try anymore. And you've only got yourself to blame. \n\nI'm not sure how her dad gets blamed for anything. If I was co-parenting and found out my child had been ill with no comfort or care because the other parent couldn't be arsed, I would 100% be pissed off. He's being a good parent. It's normal to be worried when your child is sick. It's also normal for a child - or any human being for that matter - to want to be comforted when they're not well. That's not being spoilt. \n\nYour tone in the story and in every single comment is obnoxious. You're basically pissed off that you got called out, and like any narcissist, you're trying to make excuses and convince others that you're the victim. \n\nYou have a clear issue with the fact that your daughter prefers her dad, but who can blame her when all you seem to be able to say about her is that she's annoying and spoilt? Do you really expect her to keep desparately trying to get you to like her, if that's how you feel about her?\n\nHer dad isn't brainwashing her to hate you. He's not spoiling her. You're not the victim. She's just a kid who needs to be cared for and loved. You apparently can't do either of those things.", "YTA and a terrible parent I hope her dad gets full custody", "YTA.  She had just walked in from school so exactly how annoying was her talking? This won't be an issue long- dad's going to get full custody and she'll go willingly.  Who wouldn't?  Bet you miss her child support more than her and her incessant talking", "YTA Why do you let your daughter always cry Mom Mom Mom at you instead of teaching her to get your attention normally.\n\nThen you wouldn't flip out  when you are stressed over behaviour you normally tolerate even encourage.", "YTA why don\u2019t you go for weekends and let your daughter be with her father for the rest of the week? She clearly feels more comfortable with him and you seem annoyed at her", "YTA Kids learn quick, if you tell them to shut up and go away when they want to tell you something important, they'll stop trying to tell you. And here's the thing about parental alienation, all too often it is the 'alienated' parent that is doing the alienating. You clearly regard your daughter as an annoyance. She's a child who loves you an dneeds you, and you tell her to shut up and go away. I have no doubt that in a few years time you'll be wondering why she never calls you and you know nothing about her life. Remember this point, because that's what will have been the tipping point.", "YTA do you hate all your children this much, or just the one you had with your ex?", "YTA. I have a mother like you. While I still see her weekly we don\u2019t have a close relationship at all. She\u2019s not someone I would ever turn to for help or support. She\u2019s not someone I trust.  Our relationship is fully based on my innate sense of obligation to her because she\u2019s my mother. If you\u2019re ok with that type of relationship when she\u2019s an adult then you\u2019re on the right path.  It you\u2019re the adult here, if can\u2019t manage your life then you need to address it. Because today the 12 yo is the target.

I mean, even if she didn't tell you surely you could see she was unwell? She tried telling you before dinner, but dad picked her up late, so you've had her the day, ate dinner together, spend some time in the evening and you didn't notice she was ill? Especially if so severe it needed urgent medical care, this is hard to believe.", "YTA she's 12 come on. And stop with the whole my ex is alienating my child from me line bc all you just did was show her she can't rely on you, shy bother. You're alienating her all on your own.", "YTA. You don't get to love one of your kids less because they talk.", "do you think there\u2019s a chance your daughter doesn\u2019t want to be at your house where she\u2019s been continually treated as a second priority even though it technically is your custody time? \n\nall i\u2019m gonna say is she\u2019s approaching an age where her opinion and input is going to matter a lot more in court when it comes to custody arrangements and if you keep showing her that she\u2019s not a priority in your household, you can expect her to not stay much longer. especially if her dad is willing to support and advocate for her, it might actually be the best option for all. \n\nit sounds like you already have your hands full with your other two children and rather than being understanding of how tough coparenting probably is for her, you basically just snap at her for wanting to talk to you. her own mother that she doesn\u2019t even get to see everyday. so if you can\u2019t give her the support and **attention** she needs, it might be better that she stays at her dad\u2019s.", "YTA judging from your daughters response this isnt  the first time you snapped at her like that. \n\nYour daughter contacting her father instead just goes to show who she feels safe and supported with.", "YTA.

Regardless of what you feel about your child\u2019s \u201cneediness\u201d, it is a fact that as a parent you have pushed her to not trust that you have her best interests at heart. The way you talk about her reminds me of how my mother would describe me wanting to spend any actual time with her. I do not speak with her anymore. That\u2019s what you have to look forward to if you don\u2019t acknowledge how crappy you\u2019ve been.", "Yes YTA.

In the time it took you to ask her to if she could tell you later, you could of asked what she needed!! Way to push your daughter away to where is isn\u2019t going to tell you anything anymore.", "Idk if you\u2019re the asshole. It just sounds like you were overwhelmed. Suggestion: talk to your daughter calmly. Explain that you love her and would want to know if she\u2019s feeling sick or in pain. You can also ask her to stop yelling for your attention if you\u2019re right there and are busy for a few minutes. In addition, if she calls for you, next time say \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a few minutes.\u201d", "NTA. But you dropped the ball hard. I get it. I've snapped at my kid too. Most parents are guilty of this. But the fact that she had to call her dad tells us all that you dont acknowledge being in the wrong to your kid when you mess up, or apologize.  When I snap at my kid to \"give me a damn minute\" I then calm down, find her and apologize then find out what was going on. We resolve it and i try to explain why i was overwhelmed in the moment. You dont need to be some perfect mom..but you fo need to show your daughter that you actually give a damn.", "NTA. Eff outta here with these holier than thou comments from people who must be absolutely infallible parents. \n\nIf I had a dime for every time I've been in a similar position with one of my kids, well, I'd have a lot of dimes. Stuff happens. We're doing all the things. And when I'm in the middle of 37 tasks and my kid comes at me like MOM MOM MOM, it's going to be overwhelming. Because kids do that, regardless of what you're in the middle of, and half the time it ends up being something completely arbitrary anyways. But you finish up what you're doing and go talk to your kid to find out what they wanted afterwards. If you find out it was something important, you apologize to your kid and move on. \n\nBut what would be a pretty typical parenting experience is complicated by the fact that you've got a trouble maker for an ex. He had literally no reason to fly off the handle--a normal co-parent might talk to you, say hey, our kid says she's not feeling well, do you know what's up with that? And you'd say oh really? I just got in the door, but I'll check on her and let you know. It should really be that simple. But instead he's playing \"white knight\" and trying to prove you an unfit parent over silly things--it's not doing your kid, the person who actually matters in all of this--any favors. Because it's not about the kid at the end of the day. It's about getting back at YOU. Now THAT'S parent of the year material, right there. /sarcasm \n\nIt sounds like your daughter is playing you and her dad off of each other though. If she can't get the attention she wants from mom, she calls up dad because she knows he'll blow things up and swoop in to save the day. I'd keep an eye on that. She might even be doing it unknowingly. Also--if she was SO sick, you would have come home to find her laid out on the couch or in bed, not with springs in her feet, ready to jump at you at the first opportunity to let you know just how \"sick\" she was. If she's not in therapy already, I'd consider it. It's not great for her to be in the middle of all the drama he makes. Clearly, it's rubbing off on her.\n\nHang in there, mama. I hope things work out for you.", "NTA. I don't blame you for not always going into emergency mode when you hear MOM MOM MOM MOM MOM.\n\nWhat's this business about 'won't let me see her even though it's my custody time', though?  In the US that'd be cause to go back to court.", "NTA\n\nYes you should have asked if your daughter was okay but it sounds like you were overwhelmed. All parents get like this sometimes and it can be really difficult to maintain composure and give your full attention to every situation. \n\nWhen you see your daughter I would say sorry and explain what happened, maybe say something like you were feeling overwhelmed and should have taken the time to speak to her but that when people feel this way they don't always make the best decisions and that you will try to not let that happen again. \n\nAs for the ex not letting you see her during your custody time, I would speak to the court about this because he should not be allowed to keep her from you without the court saying so.", "ESH except the kids, you know you are in the wrong for snapping at her, apologise and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.

I think this is just another poor parent who had kids without realising it'd be too much for them. \n\nLater on she'll be explaining about how she was under so much stress and was focused on this and that and them or there.... \" oh... I must be a bad mother, then?\" Classics like that'll come into play ect ect\n\nI'm empathetic but it's their own fault and they need to deal with it regardless YTA I think\n\nEdit: explaining after you get overwhelmed is the best thing u can do I agree, means a lot to kids who are trying to understand what's going on around them", "It's normal parenting stuff and toxic Co parenting is fucking horrible. Most of all for the kid.\n\nOps tone is dismissive and accusatory towards her daughter - maybe this is because English is bit first language even though its written pretty well idk\n\nProbably a lot of people who were the child in scenarios like myself who is still working to be less reserved because of the stupid drama they had going on lmao.\n\nYes they are people too and I love them, it is clear they put themselves first when it mattered to me and I've told them they were assholes. Thankfully I can have a normal relationship with them now they are older. Never really had a proper parent/child relationship past 12 though so be careful cause you may not gain your daughters trust back, ever - I really have to imagine op is not anywhere near as bad but from the way she's typing it stinks of \"too caught up in myself to see my child\" parenting and dad sounds exactly the same.

The other half are you complaining about how much she is like her dad. Gee, it's almost like you chose to have a child with someone and they got half their chromosomes/s. She is NOT spoiled because her other parent is willing to put in the effort to actually be a parent and not blame everything else for all your problems. \n\nAnd the scariest part is, people have the natural instincts to downplay and omit details that make them seem like less in the wrong.

You had the kid. Everyone ever has told you it was hard.... you knew what the gig entailed and you don't get to turn your emotions out onto the kid for existing", "I totally agree with you, putting all else aside - reddit is a fucking horrible place to put your problems lol.\n\nI hope op sees that there are people that are empathetic and aren't just out to make her feel attacked.
