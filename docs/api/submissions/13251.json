So what did you figure out?  Did you take off work to look after Bryan?\n\nIf you did, then this is not really a problem.  He is your son, it was your week to have him, you took off work to care for him.  I don't see how stepdad taking off work when it wasn't their week would make more sense.\n\nSome of this feels like petty drama with your ex bleeding into your attitude, though.  She told you stepdad was willing to take care of Bryan and could take the whole week off.  You basically respond that if stepdad really meant it, he would have called you himself, and ex-wife may have just been volunteering him.  Huh?  They are married.  It's a partnership.  Most adults aren't calling people up to say \"My spouse told you this earlier.  I would like to confirm it is true.\"  \n\nIf YOU had doubts about Matthew's abilities or comforts, YOU could have called him yourself to allay your concerns.  But acting like he didn't \"speak up\" simply because he did not call you to confirm what his wife already told you is strangely passive aggressive.\n\nI would not say you are the AH, because it is totally fine if you took care of your son yourself, and declined Matthew's help.
