Let\u2019s call my cousin Charlie. \nCharlie and I have always been close and Charlie is autistic but for the most part, does get social cues and is very empathetic. however, they do voice their opinions and believe in things very strongly. \nIn the last year, my mother (Catholic) developed a bad form of breast cancer which runs in our family and it was clearly something to worry about. She had it cut out and is going through various rounds of chemotherapy. I\u2019ve had to move out cause my young daughter is at the age where she\u2019s in nursery so could\u2019ve brought something home and made my mum worse. \nI\u2019ve been going to to church a lot with my mum recently (just me and her) to make her feel better and just to make her happy really. It\u2019s the one time I see her a week and it\u2019s the only thing she leaves the house for. My dad doesn\u2019t go because he\u2019s an atheist but hasn\u2019t said anything like what my cousin did. \nAnyway, my cousin came around a couple weeks ago (they live abroad) and Sunday came. I got ready to go to church with my mum and they basically gave me a weird look and asked why I was going. I said I had just started to go with my mum. Then Charlie said it was a waste of time and we should go somewhere else instead. I said no, I wanted to go with my mum. \nThen Charlie said that I was a hypocrite when I didn\u2019t actually believe in god. And that people shouldn\u2019t waste their time believing in something that\u2019s not real. Here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. My mum was literally in the next room so I got really mad and took Charlie out and just told her to shut up and that all my mum had to give her any hope was her faith and even if i didn\u2019t believe in it I was going to support her, cause I didn\u2019t want to make things worse for her. Then Charlie said fine and basically sulked for the next two days and after that basically acted like it didn\u2019t happen. She went home a week ago and left on good terms like nothing happened but I\u2019m still mad about it. \nI\u2019ve heard my mum crying to my dad about being scared and since that happened with Charlie, I\u2019ve been hearing it a lot more. I really don\u2019t know what to do to reassure her. I think Charlie\u2019s a moron but now my other cousins are saying I was unnecessarily horrible and Charlie just wanted to get her view across. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688908571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14uyc6d/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_to_shut_up_about_being/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If faith helps your mother through a tough time, then leave her be. If you are supporting her, so be it!", "NTA. Whether or not any of it\u2019s real, if believing helps your mom understand the world or have hope then it\u2019s a good thing. Your cousin is making atheists look bad and being an asshole about it.", "NTA.    \nAnd Charlie thought that by ridiculing your mom's beliefs that doing so would make her feel better and more hopeful?\n\nIf your mom already knew that Charlie's an atheist, then they wasted their efforts in announcing it and is a jerk.\n\nI commend your efforts in supporting your mom despite your differences in religious beliefs (and will say a prayer for her and the rest of you).", "NTA. You are right in wanting to support your mother.", "NTA Charlie should understand what your mother is going through i think is basic humanity to just shut up and be supportive it was not the place or the time for those comments and your anger it's normal, you should try and comfort your mom and maybe talk with Charlie too so they can understand how hard it is for your mom and obviously for you too.", "NTA.  \n\nYour cousin is without a doubt the ass here. You are literally trying to make your mother happy because shes very sick. Why your cousin has an issue with this is seriously disturbing..  don\u2019t let this bother you, yes your cousin is WRONG but obviously they are unhappy with themselves or their life to lash out at you for doing something kind for your mother. \n\nIf I hated fishing and all my mom wanted to do before she dies is fish I would take her every chance i got, because thats what you do when you love someone. Your mother is cherishing these moments with you, sure shes probably hoping it rubs off and you take some of it in (maybe thats what your cuzz is upset about hell idk) but she will never know whether it did or not and that honestly doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest. Keep being there for your mom", "I think you are doing the right thing and honestly - I can't for the world see you owe an apology to anyone.\n\nYour cousin is using the \"autism card\" to excuse rude and selfcentered behavior here.", "NTA. \n\nLifelong atheist myself, but one of the more tiresome things I know is other atheists who make that their whole personality. There are other more interesting things to talk about? \n\nAlso Charlie was being just plain rude.", "NTA. Charlie clearly doesn\u2019t understand the function of faith in the lives of people who believe, nor why that comfort and sense of support would be critical for your mom right now. Supporting a loved one is never wasted time, but all Charlie could see was that you were sitting somewhere listening to something you don\u2019t personally believe, and not that you were sitting next to your mother, who desperately needs you there by her side.", "NTA.  No one has the right to you how to live your life or whether you should worship or not.", "Nta. Atheists can sometimes be just as bad as religious people by giving out unwanted opinions. There\u2019s a time and place for everything and Charlie did not have to say that in your sick mother\u2019s house within earshot.", "NTA - some people just cannot shut up and insist on imposing their belief systems on others.   It was a comfort to your mum to go to church.   You are to be commended for being with her in this tough time.    At this stage, it's all about what comforts her.    Tell Charlie to STFU.", "NTA\n\nCharlie didn't need to \"get their point across.\" Nobody asked for their opinion.\n\nThere is a time and place for everything - and this was definitely the wrong time and place.", "Nta.. Also an atheist here. They is nothing wrong with supporting your mother, and jist sitting with her. Just because you don't believe doesn't mean she doesn't have too. She is going through a hard time, and if it helps her feel better so be it.", "NTA\n\nFuck Charlie, some opinions shouldn\u2019t be spoken out loud, especially when they aren\u2019t asked for.", "Charlie was kicking both your mother and yourself while you were down. You supporting your mother to engage in her faith should be none of Charlie's business. It has nothing, whatsoever to do with them. Good on you for sticking by your mom when she needs you. It's a rough road, and anything you can do to help someone through it should not be criticized by others. The helping hurts no one.", "NTA.\n\nShe came up and mocked your mom's and your religion first. She could have just said nothing. Now she's playing victim like she innocent.

I mean, you ended up yelling explaining it anyway.\n\nI'd reach out the Charlie and jsut explain the why and maybe apologise for the manner in which you spoke to them, as you're a bit stressed and worried at the moment.", "> left on good terms like nothing happened but I\u2019m still mad about it\n\nWhy are you angry about it?\n\nEDIT: NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been mocked for my Christian beliefs multiple times by other Christians.  I get so sick of being preached at about how I'm going to hell because I'm not part of their particular denomination.

I really feel I\u2019ve tried my hardest to show my support, I\u2019ve gone with them toLGBT  events. I took them to the clinic when their parents refused to.

That being said, I don't think autism is an excuse to be an asshole and he should think more before he says something like that, knowing that his cognitive empathy/theory of mind (understanding others thought processes and predicting how things will make them feel) is a weak point for him (even if as you said he has a lot of affective empathy, which is what ppl usually think of as empathy).", "What?", "Seems to me that Charlie doesn't understand that people take hope from their faiths because she doesn't have any.\n\nThat's fine but in the situation you describe, hope is pretty important.
