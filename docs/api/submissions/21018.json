I (M27) came back to the apartment and told my gf (F26) that I wasn't feeling very well and had a massive migraine from work. I had just sat in traffic and there was a ton of construction, so I sat there for like an hour and was already in a bad mood. She knew this because I was on the phone with her when I was driving home. \n\nI don't know if she thought it would be funny, but she started laughing poking my stomach as soon as I walked in. I said \"Not right now, I have a headache\" and told her I was going to lie down. As soon as I lay on the bed, she follows me into the room and starts talking to me about a bunch of random stuff she saw online that day. I just ask her to give me an hour to rest my eyes. Then she starts JUMPING ON THE BED and telling me I'm being lazy and how I don't drink enough water.\n\nI just say \"PLEASE STOP\" in a firm voice (I did not yell), and she started laughing at the top of her lungs and my head felt like it was going to explode. So I asked her if she could throw me a water bottle from the fridge and as soon as she left, i locked the door and put on my noise cancelling mode on my airpods.\n\nI woke up an hour later and she was gone from the apartment. She called me an AH via text and told me she was going to spend the weekend at her parent's house and not to bother calling her, and that I made her cry.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1688177532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14niy09/aita_for_locking_my_gf_out_of_the_bedroom/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just how old is your girlfriend? She sounds really really really immature", "NTA.  She sounds incredibly immature.", "NTA.  When I have a migraine, not only does my husband understand I need to lay down alone in the dark and quiet bedroom, he\u2019s careful to be quiet in the rest of the house.  He even offers to sleep in the guest room (though I only accept that with the most severe migraines, since it only makes a difference when they\u2019re THAT bad).  Pestering you and jumping on the bed when you\u2019re in that shape is something you\u2019d expect of a very rude small child, not a grown adult!", "NTA-She wanted attention and didn't care if you were in the condition to give it or not.  She'll get it from her mom when she tells her how you're being neglectful. Are you sure she is 26?", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds like a total clown. What an idiot.", "NTA. She was being an AH. Migraines are rough and that was very rude.", "NTA by any means. She was fully aware of your situation. You asked for some time to yourself and she completely ignored your request. She clearly overreacted by crying and leaving for the weekend. I don\u2019t see you at fault at all. She needs to respect your boundaries more man. Is this how your relationship is when you\u2019re not dealing with a migraine? She sounds insufferable. I personally wouldn\u2019t think this is grounds for a breakup but if she consistently acts like this then i\u2019d start exiting immediately. If I was in this situation i\u2019d also think this whole situation was stupid and unnecessarily taken way too far", "NTA - she would no longer be a girlfriend of mine.", "NTA.  Enjoy a quiet weekend", "NTA - I had to scroll up to see how young your GF is because she\u2019s acting like a child. If this is how she treats you when you are not feeling good, you may want to reconsider this relationship. She sounds incredibly selfish and wildly immature.", "NTA, are you sure she is actually old enough to be your girlfriend?  She is seriously acting like a 12 yr old boy.  Why would she think that is ok?  Are you really sure you want her back?", "NTA. This is not empathetic or kind behavior.", "Holy shit, a full grown adult behave that way? To their sick partner? My brother and sister get migraines and they're so fucking painful.

How annoying", "NTA - I have friends who can be incredibly annoying and in my face 24/7 when they want to. They know to leave me alone when I have a migraine.", "NTA.  She sounds exhausting and childish.", "What the fuck?! Maybe because when i get a migraine i literally cannot function but if my partner had one I\u2019d be certain to be quiet and not disturb him. Hell, he works mornings currently and will be in bed when i get home, simply sleeping without a headache and I\u2019m going to be very quiet and not engage with him when i get home even though all i wanna do is jump on him. I understand there are things more important than my wants. NTA.", "NTA.  Apparently she's never had a migraine in her life and doesn't understand that noise and light hurts.

I would've locked people out too.", "NTA.

Often they required a trip to the ER and an IV.\n\nIf my partner had treated me like your GF treated you, I would break up with them. That\u2019s disrespectful and rude. She should be offering you meds or a back/neck rub or getting you water or pulling the shades or getting you a cool cloth.  What she should NOT be doing is making it worse and then playing the victim.\n\nNTA - I\u2019m not usually one to say \u201cleave\u201d but, in this situation, I would definitely be thinking about it.", "OMG dude, who cares if you were an AH, she's a monster. I have migraines and if my partner did this to me during one of them, it'd be the last interaction we had as a couple. NTA.", "WTF????\n\nNTA.\n\nAlso, please don't let her get back.

You did what you had to do to get your rest. She was super inconsiderate.", "NTA. I\u2019m so tired of people not taking pain especially migraines seriously.

I speak from experience. You showed amazing restraint. Your gf sounds like an immature, spoiled brat. Rethink this relationship.", "I had migranes all my childhood and now as an adult suffer from vertigo migranes with an occasional migrane still in the mix.

If my 3-year-old son knew that Mama's migraines meant playing quietly and not bothering me unless it was something he needed that he couldn't get, then your adult girlfriend should certainly be able to leave you alone for a little while to rest and try to break your headache! Seriously, that's just insane - even my ex at his most AHish never aggravated a migraine like that.", "NTA at all. Migraines can be so brutal. My husband gets them a couple times a month and the only thing that helps outside of medication is letting him rest in a dark and quiet room for as long as he needs, and I would never think to harass and annoy him while doing so. That\u2019s wildly immature imo.", "Speaking from personal experience: your girlfriend sounds manic and there seems to be a deeper underlying issue in your relationship.

It gets easier as you age, the fights turn into conversations when you're both mature enough. Feel like you know this fight isn't the issue, the issue may be the way you communicate and that can always be improved. It's  kinda silly though, my advice? Next time this happens, sit her down like your going to have an important conversation and say plainly, I've got a migraine give me an hour now to try and make it better because without this treatment option. I'm going to be a dick for the rest of today due to the migraine.\n\nYou can then say plainly I need this time to heal/fix. It's not a 100% treatment option but doing nothing will definitely not fix the migraine.\n\nSorry late here for me and I just smoked a bowl before bed so if it doesn't make sense ill let sober me know in the morning and can do fixes as needed.
