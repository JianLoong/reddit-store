I (M27) came back to the apartment and told my gf (F26) that I wasn't feeling very well and had a massive migraine from work.

She knew this because I was on the phone with her when I was driving home. \n\nI don't know if she thought it would be funny, but she started laughing poking my stomach as soon as I walked in. I said \"Not right now, I have a headache\" and told her I was going to lie down. As soon as I lay on the bed, she follows me into the room and starts talking to me about a bunch of random stuff she saw online that day. I just ask her to give me an hour to rest my eyes. Then she starts JUMPING ON THE BED and telling me I'm being lazy and how I don't drink enough water.\n\nI just say \"PLEASE STOP\" in a firm voice (I did not yell), and she started laughing at the top of her lungs and my head felt like it was going to explode. So I asked her if she could throw me a water bottle from the fridge and as soon as she left, i locked the door and put on my noise cancelling mode on my airpods.\n\nI woke up an hour later and she was gone from the apartment.

When I feel bubbly and silly like that and don\u2019t gee the message to reign it in, it\u2019s not uncommon for a firm tone to be the result. Yes it hurts, so fucking bad, emotionally because my first thoughts are always that you don\u2019t like me for who I am anymore and I\u2019m too much.

I get that she was happy to see you, and clearly wanted to unload her day on you, but she clearly doesn't understand how debitating migraines can be.", "NTA. Your gf sounds positively demented! If you're lucky, she'll stay at home with her parents.", "Is your gf actually a 3 year old? Yikes. Even my dog knows when to leave me alone", "NTA. My 2 year old has more empathy for me when I\u2019m not feeling well than your adult girlfriend.", "NTA you came home told her ypu had a migraine she decided to pester tou, you said not now I have a headache she continued. You went to lay down she continued you firmly said stop she continued. I'd reply okay but don't boundaries work both ways I asked you multiple times tp stop and you thought me being unwell was hilarious and would not stop despite me telling you like 5 times I am not well and to give me just 1 hour. Then enjoy a quiet weekend", "Is your GF 12 years old, who TF does that?\n\nNTA, I would have done the same.", "She\u2019s 26 and jumping on the bed when you\u2019re visibly uncomfortable?\nNta and I would find someone else lol", "If you have any reason to be in a relationship with her after that, it's gotta be a good one. That utter lack of understanding is crazy. NTA", "Sounds like a general lack of empathy and possibly a bit of narcissism on her part.\n\nIf she can't tell what's wrong with that then it's probably not worth hurting yourself by continuing the relationship", "NTA. You handled it way better than I would have. That's complete BS on her part. Anyone who's experienced migraines knows that they are pure hell. And to show absolutely no sympathy, in fact actively trying to make it worse... holy shit, I'd reconsider the relationship.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to grow up.  How inconsiderate of her.  I can\u2019t even.", "You know who this chick really reminds me of? Spinel from the Steven Universe movie.", "NTA. Dump her. You had a serious health issue and she was messing with you on purpose while you had it.", "Omg she sounds so annoying lol", "NTA. As a migraine sufferer, one of the worst things is someone who fucks around when you feel like you\u2019re dying. You asked her to stop, to leave you alone, you didn\u2019t feel well and she got louder and louder. \n\nOne thing I have learned over the years is that unless someone has had a migraine, they don\u2019t understand the pain we are going through. They think it\u2019s just a headache and some aspirin will make it go away. They just don\u2019t get it.", "NTA. Time to shop for a new girlfriend", "NTA and your girlfriend seems to be a child! Red flags for you", "NTA you were in pain she knew you were in pain and decided to basically torture you for her own entertainment. She then threw a tantrum because you stopped her. She has no empathy and isn\u2019t really likely to develop much now as an adult, is this someone you want long term? What would she be like if something serious happened to you in the future and you needed care?", "It should be simple. If one's partner has a migraine the best thing to do is give them space.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is your GF simply thought she was helping to cheer you up and her antics would help.  \n\nStill, if she knew you had a migraine, she should have backed off. \n\nNTA.", "Your girlfriend is annoying red fog horn. The question is can you see her doing this again? And if so is this a person you want to keep chasing knowing that she\u2019ll never respect you enough.\n\nNTA she a grown woman she should know when to back the F off someone", "NTA she was pushing your boundaries to get a reaction out of you and then didn't like the reaction she got.", "No, you're not the AH.  Your girlfriend needs to grow up and learn some empathy and what a boundary means.  She owes you the apology.", "NTA\n\nIs she a human or a dog? Cause like\u2026this is the kind of behaviour I would expect from a dog who hasn\u2019t seen it\u2019s owner since breakfast or whatever and doesn\u2019t understand the concept of having a migraine. \n\nAlso, did you tell her it was a headache or a migraine? Actually- was it a headache or an actual migraine? Because they\u2019re absolutely not the same and if a 60 minute rest in a quiet room can get rid of a migraine for you enough to speak to people and be functional, I wanna know what meds you\u2019re taking so I can cop them myself lol", "> NTA - she would no longer be a girlfriend of mine......", "Hate people like this. Don\u2019t you think that if people could cure migraines by drinking more water they would do so? NTA", "My 5 year old understood the concept of pain and how bad mommas headaches were... and always tried to be quiet and helpful.   This woman is beyond selfish....", "That's disrespectful to ten-year-olds. I know several kids aged 8-10 who are thoughtful, compassionate and kind. They wouldn't appreciate being lumped with OP's gf who, for the record, is a flaming AH", "Yeah GF seems to have a complete lack of compassion and endurance and throws tantrums when things aren't being played out the way she wants and desires. She needs to grow the hell up and see how the world around her is revolving with her not being the Sun.", "That last sentence makes you my hero for the day.", "Exactly. She sounds like she needs to bake in the oven a little longer...perhaps her parents house is where she belongs, since she can't climb back in utero to make that happen.", "This. All of this. I had an asskicker of a migraine Monday. My husband took the kids to my mom so I wouldn't have to lift a finger, see them or hear them. He put me to bed after haphazardly throwing our curtains up to darken the room (we've just moved in and there are blinds so the curtains weren't necessary). Got my heating pad and a cold cloth and went to work in his office. This man even put the baby monitor by the bed with the speaker in his office so if I needed him, I wouldn't need to get out of bed.\n\nThis dude is NTA but his gf sure is", "She may have thought she could cheer him up but she should have gotten a clue pretty quickly that he wasn't in the mood.", "Right? Totally childish. He tried to be polite and ask for just an hour to rest his eyes, and she couldn\u00b4t even give him that. Poke poke poke ha ha pay attention to me. \n\nThen she cries about it when he tells her to stop, and runs to her mom to tattle, like a badly behaved toddler.\n\nMaybe even an insult to children to call her childish, children are able to understand if you don\u00b4t feel well and need to rest.", "He needs to send all her shit to her parents and tell her to stay there. Forever.", "dude same. have had terrible migraines all my life. I would ask them to not come back too lol.", "either her parents are the reason she's like that or they're gonna be telling her all about how stupid and inconsiderate she was", "Why did she block your number?", "She blocked your number because you were ill or beforehand?", "A 12 year old boy? Cause 12 year old girls don\u2019t also do this? And she\u2019s already a girl\u2026..?", "\u201cdiapee change\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "I'm sorry but even if they both do it honestly wouldn't affect the verdict for most people op had every right to lock the door and as many have said this would be a deal breaker for them, I understood at a young age that when my mum has a bad headache (as it turns out actually quite probably migraines) I was to leave her alone and the fact that a 27 doesn't understand that is shocking even if op didn't actually call it a migraine it would still be a common curtsy to leave them tf alone and check up on op every so often to see if they need anything like water or painkillers to help which is not what op has described. Op your NTA in this situation and I would suggest you tell her that her behavior was completely out of line there and has massively upset you and if she doesn't like hearing that or doesn't care then she can leave and go back to parents with her shit because that is not someone you want in your life.", "He got downvoted for speaking the truth", "What you can work, but to do it while suffering a migraine?  It won't happen.  Conversation IS important, but he already had asked her to leave him to rest and he was unwell. \n\nWhen people have migraines, it is hard to think.  Every light seems so much brighter, every sound is louder.   Sometimes you can't see.  Some people lose the ability to speak coherently.  Walking can be difficult or dangerous.  Sometimes there are aurora or halos that appear that obstruct your vision.  You can see, but not well.\n\nMovement of any kind is horrible and often not worth the effort. Even breathing just makes you more miserable.  It can send stabs of pain through your body, or make it feel like your skull is being crushed.  Talking hurts.  Your heartbeat is awful and annoying.\nThe nausea is brutal.  Vomiting makes everything worse, but not vomiting also sucks.\n\nSometimes all you can do is lay on the floor of a scalding hot shower and cry.  But crying also hurts.  Sleep helps, but it can be difficult to sleep.\n\nDrinking water won't fix it, taking something OTC (Advil, Aleve, Tylenol) doesn't work.   \n\nIn short, anything that requires any sort of effort at all is agony.\n\nMy husband says he isn't feeling well and I ask what I can do for him.  I offer to make him soup, or what time he wants to wake up from his nap.. if he wants help getting into the shower.", "Yet he communicated with her and that did nothing?", "What a biased and frankly bigoted point to make up. Nothing in the story even suggests that was her motive. Stop projecting things from your own life onto OP.", "Why does OP need to grow up? He told gf that he needed some time out &she acted like a child, OP is NTA but gf is a major ah", ">  if she is actually a ten year old I'm going to change my ruling.\n\n    > I'm also going to call a friend.", "I'd just tell her to stay at her parents full stop. I am pretty sure she would be the first to kick off if she wasnt well and OP behaved like she did. She sounds exhausting and incredibly immature. Imagine coming home unwell and having to deal with that?", "It's a typo. He meant she's 2.6.", "12 year olds of any gender usually act better than this (hopefully ex) gf. She\u2019s either stupid or uncaring or both. This would be the end of the relationship for me.", "I think the part about locking his door with his headphones on sounds like something an upset teenager would do. They need to learn to communicate", "Ugh. You\u2019re so right about the migraines that come with the aura too. Especially ones that have vertigo along with it. \n\nI remember a particularly awful one several years ago where I was just laying on the floor in a dark room crying from the pain. I was probably about 14? I couldn\u2019t even sit up to take the tablets and water my Dad was going to give me because the pain/lights from the aura/vertigo was so severe.\n\nMy migraine aura is what I imagine the northern lights to look like. Except sometimes red. And on fast forward with stabbing imagery. Not pleasant.\n\nHonestly OP was a lot more patient than I would have been in this situation.", "I understand what you mean. I get visual auroras before I even get any pain. I usually don't announce it to anyone that I really can't see very well. It will be like white zig zag lines over half my vision. I've learned to take pain medicine right then.", "I would hate her, with or without a migraine.", "Agreed. OP please show your brat of a gf this post. That'll give her something to cry over.\n\nAlso obv - NTA.", "If you go blind during headaches, please do see a neurologist. I have 5 different headache disorders but another thing I have is idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Basically there\u2019s too much spinal fluid around my brain and spinal cord. It\u2019s not lethal but it does cause the optic nerves to swell and can lead to blindness. If you lose vision at all for any length of time you need to have either a neurologist or at bare minimum an optometrist because that blindness can become permanent.", "Just poking in the stomach pissed me off to read. That\u2019s one of the most annoying things you can do to a person already", "I haven\u2019t had a migraine (I\u2019m 56 so I doubt I\u2019ll get one at this point). But I\u2019ve had bad headaches, and I\u2019m an MD, and I know as much as I can about migraines without actually experiencing them. Gf is absolutely the asshole here. OP NTA", "No, its something that some one with a migraine would do, & he tried to communicate she wasn't listening.", "I mean, this day and age with governments supporting child workers, it's not a stretch.", "> that would be inappropriate for OP to be old enough to work and have a ten year old gf.\n\nThey know what they said.", "This exactly my 9 and 10 year old actually look after me when I have a migraine they are exceptionally quiet until I recover then it's a herd of elephants lol", "I\u2019ve had this too. It\u2019s terrifying until the headache comes.", "ive had this happen before. its literally terrifying. your head feels like its literally splitting in two, or your brain is swelling and is about to pop like a damn water balloon.\n\nfor me it can be in strikes where its like a flash bang and then i cant see large spots of my vision, or it can be a slow creep until i realize \u201coh fuck i can only see like 15% of whats in front of me the rest of it is just bright smudges\u201d\n\nusually i can get into bed and intentionally close my eyes before i go completely blind, if i was out and about i would freak the *everloving fuck* out \n\n*EDIT: typo", "\"Now young Oliver, don't make a migraine worse for the customer, or you'll get a pay cut and a time out. You don't want that do you?\"", "Not only children\u2026my CAT will stop asking to play and come up to one of us to snuggle if we aren\u2019t feeling well or unhappy.\n\nOPs girlfriend is less empathetic than a species famous for thinking the world revolves around them!", "I hate doctors who do that. My mum kept getting told it's becuase your fat when she said she was tired, run down feeling awful. So she got fitter lost alot of weight and it helped a little but she kept telling the doctors she still didn't feel great so she got told well your old so thats why. Then it's long covid.\n\nShe has stage 4 bowel cancer. Ugh!! It makes me so mad when I hear people suffering becuase doctors blame everything on weight!\n\nI'm so sorry you experienced migranes for that long, it must have been brutal.", "Great outcome. Happy for you.", "\u2018Fat shaming\u2019 within the scope of medical treatment is SO prevalent and SO dangerous. \n\nI\u2019m super grateful that you connected with a practitioner who treated you as a whole-body person, and not just as a number on the scale. I hope you continue to be pain-free and treated with respect and consideration when seeking medical care.", "Because being obese usually is the problem"]}
