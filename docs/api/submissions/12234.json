After that, he became an \u201cuncle dad\u201d to us. \n\nAt no point did anyone, including our father, ever suggest or state that we were not really his kids. He never treated us as if he thought we weren\u2019t his. He told us how much he loved us and how proud he was of us as much as possible. My sister did have a falling-out with him when she turned 30 and hasn\u2019t been on speaking terms with him since. Even at then, he never said she wasn\u2019t his daughter. \n\nTwo weeks after I turned 33, as he was preparing to get married to his second wife (F62), he told us out of the blue that he had arranged for us to get our DNA tested to determine whether or not we were really his children. He said he still loved us, but he had reason to doubt and he just wanted the truth. My sister, living in a faraway state, never even considered it. I still lived close to him, saw him and his fianc\u00e9e regularly, and had a friendly relationship with him made possible by our shared interests and my instinct towards conflict avoidance. I had my cheeks swabbed by the lab. I then reconsidered the full implications of this, mainly because of the dispersions it would cast on my mother, and went back and had it taken back and revoked my consent. Those were my most shameful and proudest moments.  \n\nHe did not take that well, of course. In response he moved to another state with his wife, having angry back-and-forths with me via e-mail and leaving behind his aging parents for their other children to care for. My grandmother (F85) has cancer and my grandfather (M87) is increasingly senile. In his forgetfulness he has continued to reach out to his oldest son, who has responded with invective and delusions, including speculations that my grandfather, his brother, or a gay man my mother was friends with and was murdered back in the \u201880s could be his children\u2019s real father. He is obsessed with his parents\u2019 will (they are wealthy) and, in his latest message to him, said that he\u2019d come visit his ailing father only if he told my sister in me to get the DNA test done or be written out of the inheritance, which he already is. \n\nI realize all of this doesn\u2019t really paint me as being an AH, but my uncle, one of the accused, has encouraged me to go ahead and do it, that way we can throw the doubtless positive results in his face and get this madness to stop. I don\u2019t think that would do anything, though, but show that I\u2019ll give in to my father\u2019s demands and feed his delusions which have grown too deeply-rooted to stop. Am I wrong, though? Should I just do it and try to put an end to this family rift?

Unless he\u2019s developing dementia too. \n\nIf you have no reason to doubt he\u2019s your father, continue to refuse to do it. There will be no end to his ridiculous demands if you give in to this.", "INFO:  He never wanted this before he met his second wife? And then requested it just prior to his second marriage?\n\nI think that's a bit odd, do you suppose she's behind this at all?", "NTA. \n\nYou have no obligation to submit to a medical test to satisfy your fathers delusions. \n\nYou and your sister are both grown, there is no need for test NOW. I would be insulted and so hurt if my father acted this way. \n\nSorry that your dad kinda sucks. You are perfectly entitled to say no.", "To add some clarity:\n1. I regard my father\u2019s doubts about my mother\u2019s fidelity as completely baseless. I realize that I wasn\u2019t there at the time, and that to many men their mother is a saint even if she isn\u2019t, but nothing I know about her would suggest she would ever cheat. The truth is that my father, as demonstrated here, is a controlling bastard and she was damned lucky to pull away from him. I hope the same thing happens with his new wife.\n \n2. Speaking of the new wife, several commenters have suggested that she has some sort of role in this. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, or to what extent. She is a mousey, submissive woman who has demonstrated a reliance on him as the man. He is a misogynist and has a sick regard towards women\u2019s purity. He made sure we knew leading up to their wedding that she was a virgin. I just don\u2019t think that she is really the driving force behind this. Some role, maybe, but not the main one.", "NTA\n\nYour father sounds unbalanced and delusional. You aren't obligated to feed into the crazy. It could be a mental illness or something physical like dementia. You don't owe him anything. Just stop indulging in this fantasy world of his. At the very least, you can admit that a DNA test at this point in life is meaningless and useless.\n\nImagine accusing your father and brother of getting your wife pregnant....twice.", "I think it is strange after all this time he is requesting a dna test.  If you're not comfortable don't do it.  NTA", "NTA - WHY do you have to tell him the results IF you do get the test?  \n\nSenility runs in families, and it sounds like your father (won't call him a Dad) is either being led around by his NEW wife  (in order to cut you guys out of his future) or has an early onset dementia, which is causing this unwarranted obsession.", "NTA but I think you should do it for your OWN sake.  As a person who avoids conflict, you have a way to eliminate a major source of conflict in your life.  In addition, you need to know what your parentage is so that you are fully informed on health-related info, etc.  Until this is settled, your mom's reputation is up in the air anyway.  Since it doesn't seem like it will affect an already struggling relationship with your father, I don't see why you wouldn't do it.", "NTA.  This sounds like a very sudden personality shift - if anyone needs medical testing it may be your father.", "NTA. You are both well into adulthood and need not indulge his own insecurities.", "Personally I would do it to shut him up and then remain NC, but that's just me. I think you're not an asshole no matter what you decide, because it's your choice whether you want to do this. You're not a child anymore, your parents are divorced, and it doesn't really matter whether he's your dad or not since he's not involved in your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI can't tell you what to do. I spent years wanting a paternity test to prove my dad was not my dad. Regrettably he is. It didn't really change anything between us, though. The damage was already done.\n\nOn one hand, you could end the whole thing by just getting the test and whichever way it falls is how it falls. On the other hand... you and your sister are adults, and you are NOT required to do anything. You are not responsible for your father's new paranoid thoughts, and you are under no obligation to resolve this. It's HIS problem. \n\nI will say, never let an inheritance be a negotiation chip. Money is handy, but you will survive and be just fine without it. If he wants to spite you for not getting a DNA test, then he wants to spite you, but he's the one that has to let the thought go. If you are his, chances are high he'd spite you for the pushback anyway. If you aren't his, he has no reason to leave you anything. Both are losing sides.", "NTA. Whatever the results of the test, a man who is accusing his own father or brother of being your dad, and who is neglecting his own old and ill parents, is not a person you need to prove anything to. Your grandparents' lives nor your life will improve if you take this test. A man who is convinced he was cheated on will just come up with a new story of how you cheated the test. Instead, write the man off. Move on with your life.", "NTA, but it the force of his demands all of a sudden sounds like there\u2019s something psychological going on. Are you aware of any mental health issues your dad might have had at any point?", "NTA, to me it sounds like your dad (or his new wife) is plotting to contest your grandparents will(s). Not sure how a paternity test helps at this point though. Does the new wife have kids? If so, has your dad talked about adopting them? Maybe get the test, but don't share the results. Possibly seek legal advice.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"that way we can throw the doubtless positive results in his face and get this madness to stop\" .. just not doing it will let you set a boundary, without any drama. Your dad is an AH, no need to cater to him.", "Seems like the main issue for OP is that it casts aspersions on the mother, and going along with that narrative would potentially insult her.\nI'd love to hear what mom has to say about this request/accusation. I'd ask HER whether she'd prefer to leave him guessing (and miserable) or if she'd like the opportunity to smack Wifey #2 in the face with the results. \nI'd let Mom make the call on this.", "NTA. You mentioned that senility runs in your family. Sounds like the more important test would be for your father to be tested for signs of dementia.", "u/BookBison is it possible your father has early-onset dementia or Alzheimer's? Nta", "NTA- I'm pretty sure this is an episode of Its always sunny and those guys rock! Keep on keepin on OP", "NTA.   \n\n\nI don't think either way - do the DNA test or don't do the DNA test - would make you an AH. It's your genome. You control it. Not your Dad.   \n\n\nThis is actually an interesting ethical question. This technology is so new. But ya, if you don't feel good about doing it, don't. I tend to be of the mind that our genome is who we are, and therefor we own it, absolutely. Much like we own our hair or our kidney.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI know there are people saying do it anyway, but I have to wonder what good comes from it?\n\nIt seems like the only outcomes are negative. I don't believe whatever is driving these concerns will be satisfied by any test result. That he reacted the way he did to your refusal reinforces my belief.", "NTA, this is 100% his second wife's doing. Let him know that base on his AITA results he's not your father and to kindly leave you alone.\n\nAlso, make that your grand parent's will can't be altered if they are currently not in sound mind. It sucks, but it seems like he's not above trying to trick them further.", "NTA. But I\u2019d tell him, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to want to be my father, so, congratulations, you aren\u2019t anymore.\u201d And then go NC like your sister.", "NTA\n\nBut, personally, I'm not sure why you wouldn't just go ahead with it. You don't really know his story the way he does and why he may actually think this is needed.\n\nIf anything, you can throw the results in his face and cut him off from your life for good or whatever.", "NAH\n\nHe has the right to ask you to take the test, you also have the right to refuse.  If you decide not to, he can decide for himself how to proceed, but you don't have any obligation and to me, I don't see how any good will come of it... just dragging up old history that is essentially irrelevant now anyways.", "NTA...but are you afraid he's actually right? I think if you were confident he was wrong you could easily take the test. I don't think there is a \"correct\" answer in this case.", "ESH\n\nHe's an asshole for asking for a test for sure, and it sounds like he might not be well. It shouldn't matter at this point. However, he has a right to know, and so do you, don't you think? Just take the test.", "ESH. Unpopular opinion I know. \n\nHe wants to know if you\u2019re his biological child. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that. He may have waited an odd amount of time and it shouldn\u2019t matter but he specifically said it was because he had some doubts, not because he\u2019d feel different. He\u2019s human and it\u2019s not a weird question to want answered, but it\u2019s an AH move to wait 37 years. Still. He probably didn\u2019t realise it bothered him until now and I would want to know if I was him. I just wouldn\u2019t want to do that to my adult kids. \n\nThen you. I mean. Just get the test. I don\u2019t know what your end game is by refusing. Just cut him off if you\u2019re so averse to the idea (as your sister did) or take the test. There\u2019s literally no point being indecisive about this.", "YTA! Both you and your sister.  \nOnly needed to read the first bit to come to this conclusion, Good bad or ugly. He deserves to know period. If you're not gonna give it to him, step out of his life permanently.", "NTA - You have the right to say no but I also think your dad has a right to know. Either way, I would look more into why your dad says he have reason to doubt you're his biological children. If your mum says that he's your dad, and this whole thing started when his fianc\u00e9e came into the picture - is she the cause of all of this?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
