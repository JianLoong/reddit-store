But what really gets on my nerves are the hypothetical questions \"If we had a cat and a kid, and the cat needed to go to the vet but the only extra money we have is going to buy our kid bday present, what would you do? If our kid got switched at birth but we only discovered after, what would you do? If you discovered that you only got 7 days left, what would you do?\". Just random and annoying questions that she wants to have lengthy conversations about. She even has a book that has a bunch of these useless questions, she loves this shit. Even worst, sometimes we fight about these things that never happened to us, like, come on.\n\nWell, last week I snapped, I just wanted to have a good time with my girl and she asked what would i do if all the internet and phones stopped working out of nowhere, and nobody knew what was happening. And I just said I would be happy that I would be able to have time off her needy questions, always needing me to say I would look out for her. I just was annoyed and wanted her to stop. She just said my wish was granted and left, because of a simple comment.\n\nMaybe I was a bit harsh, but come on, I just wanted a night off and said something unnecessary. She stopped the questions but also is kinda cold with me, and my friends keep insisting I got to apologize, but I don't see why, finally she stopped the bugging, I just want her to go back to her normal self now.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671140110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmwsvr/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_needy_for_making/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes is the keyword. Obviously this makes her happy and this is part of who she is. You need to accept that part of her. But you do have the right to sometimes ask her to stop because you don't want to at that moment.

Have you ever asked her why she likes talking about these things? Do you have deep, or interesting, conversations about other topics? It sounds like she is trying to connect and discuss your worldviews, your values, how you approach problem-solving, etc. through hypotheticals.

Maybe come up with your own questions and take turns! It\u2019s all in good fun\n\nAlso, I ask weirder questions than that.. asked my BF if he\u2019d rather toenails for teeth or hair for finger nails\u2026. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHe answered me btw\u2026.", "YTA. I don't think you'll need to apologize because she'll probably dump you over this. I would.", "YTA this is obviously her way of trying to connect with you. As a weird questioner too, I do it because I want to know my SO better and know how he thinks. It has led to fun and interesting conversations and is my way of connecting with him. This was helpful as it keeps us from staring at each other in silence.\n\nThe way you talk about her makes it seem like you don't actually like her. I would reconsider what it is about her that you truly enjoy and it can't be things she does for you. I ask this because you seem to despise a core tenet of her personality.", "YTA. About to be a single one too.", "you just sound like you hate your girlfriend honestly yta", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re bothered because she\u2019s stopped asking questions, yet that\u2019s what you asked for.\nIf you dislike conversations like this, just tell her.

There\u2019s a reason she asks questions like this constantly, learn that reason. For example I ask questions like this as well and have random what if situations playing in my head constantly. My reason for this is due to my adhd and anxiety, the questions and what if\u2019s are a form of simulation that help occupy the brain in order to help concentration improve. She\u2019s not doing it to purposely annoy you.", "YTA and now your gf has been made to feel like she can\u2019t communicate freely with you. She will now second guess any conversation or question she asks. The questions she asks are a way for her to be closer to you and to pick your brain.

I can't say for sure why your girlfriend asks all these questions (is it anxiety ? is she neurodivergent ? does she simply like thought exercises because for some reason it's stimulating for her ? I'll probably never know), but this is obviously important to her. And you know that, because you've had fights over it before. From where I stand, this is part of who she is, and apparently a big part. That kind of petty comment is just needlessly mean. Be with her and admit that it's a side of her that she needs to express, or don't be with her if this \"unnecessary\" talk is too much for you, but don't talk to her like that.", "No, you\u2019re not the asshole. You\u2019re a heartless shmuck, which is much worse. Condescending, shallow, boring, what does she see in you? Please, please, do everyone a favor and end this relationship.

Instead of telling her that while she might love the hypothetical situation conversations you find them draining you snapped and called her needy.

Constant questions drive me up the wall too, but you should have let her know how you felt before going ballistic.", "YTA. I was like this until It got diagnosed with anxiety. Add to this that I\u2019m introverted and had very low self-esteem in my early 20s. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have a husband that loves and cherishes me. He has sometimes told me he\u2019s not up to questions that evening. He has told me that my question has been asked before. He rates my questions.

On the other hand, you owe her to be respectful and not snap at her for not being able to read your mind. You said you just wanted to have fun with her. What does this fun include? Because she seems like she loves to get to know you through all these questions and like any topic can be fun if she discusses it with you. What would you do instead? What does \"have fun\" mean? She sounds so interesting and sweet, I would love to chat with her about all these things. And please, if you dislike who she is so much, just do her a favor and break up with her.", "YTA.\n\nThis is obviously her way of getting to know you better. She\u2019s learning about your value system.\n\nCould it be annoying? Sure, but you\u2019ve had ample opportunities to bring this up instead of bottling it up and exploding at her.\n\nSo many AITA posts are \u201cI love my partner completely. They\u2019re the best except for this one thing which is a complete dealbreaker for me.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s a dealbreaker, it\u2019s a dealbreaker, but there are ways to discuss it without being insulting.", "YTA. You told her to stop talking about the things she enjoys talking about and now you\u2019re upset she isn\u2019t talking to you? I wouldn\u2019t talk to you anymore either. You two are clearly not compatible, and that\u2019s okay. Just break up with her instead of being cruel.", "Okay, I get it, but still YTA for the harshness.  This seems to be a major part of her personality, and while it's not your fault for being annoyed by it, it seems to be this sandpaper part of her that will constantly grate at you for the rest of your relationship.  You need to apologize for the snapping and sit down and talk about this, and whether your relationship is the best fit for the both of you.", "NTA. She just did you a favor buddy. Let her go. Do you really want to live like that for the rest of your life ?", "YTA \n\nBecause of the way you responded to her. (Although it and the way she responded did make me laugh). Have you tried talking to her about this before? Or you haven\u2019t and it just built up until you snapped? I think what would be best is if you apologize for how it came out since you didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feelings but that you also want to have a talk with her\u2026.about why she feels the need to constantly talk. Why can\u2019t she be ok with silence? Could those questions be her way of trying to have deeper conversations with you? And if so, why? Or is she simply bored and she uses those questions to spark conversations?", "Sounds like yeah, YTA  \n\n\nDid you do the adult thing and talk to her about this before you \"snapped\" at her? I get that those kind of questions can be annoying, especially if they're constant and sometimes lead to fights. It's clearly been annoying you for a while, but did you let her know this? Or did you let it build up and simmer until you blew up at her?", "YTA. Listen, I get it. The endless questions would drive me nuts too. But this is where you put on your big boy pants and actually TALK to your girlfriend about it instead of letting it fester and fester and fester until you snap and say hurtful things. It's so easy to say something like, \"Hey, I know you like to ask hypothetical questions and have conversations about them, but I really hate getting in fights over something that didn't actually happen and it's starting to wear on me. Can we maybe limit the hypothetical questions to one a week and agree that if it somehow starts a fight, we'll just table the conversation?\" If you pick a time where you can say this in a calm, kind tone, it might start a great conversation about what both your needs are for quiet time and personal space.", "NAH ... BUT you two are not compatible long term. She loves these sorts of hypothetical questions, you hate them. You're asking each other to change whether you realize it or not. There's nothing wrong with either thing, but it will be hard to sustain long term.", "YTA, but your GF sounds fun.  I\u2019d definitely hang out with her, and ask her stupid questions like \u201cwhat if you kept dating that guy who berated you for being a person who was interested in things that he wasn\u2019t interested in?\u201d", "You are boring as fuck!

It sounds like you don\u2019t like HER. And maybe she is realizing that\u2026", "Lol I am like her. It\u2019s just our minds thinking rapidly and exploring while building a conversation. Maybe that\u2019s the problem, you don\u2019t like a wondering mind\u2026 so why blow up on her? Poor girl. Hope she dumps you and finds someone that will engage in her way of thinking. Yta", "YTA.

She sucks coz she never STFU and actually argue about things that never happen or will happen. You suck because of the way you've handled it. You should never wait so long that you're going to snap. Good communication is a key. If there is an issue, you should men up and talk it thru BEFORE shit like this happen.\nI do understand you. But c'mon man! Apologize and tell her nicely that is just too much for you sometimes. Maybe you can even figure out the code/safe word to stop her taking when you have a bad day?\nI got this with my best friend. I'm extrovert, he's quiet and silent and I make him talk. We both also have tons of issues. Very unlikely pair let me tell you that. When he snaps, I can cry for two-three weeks at a time. We got a convo about our different needs and now just have a code to stfu or let other person be.", "ESH. You say you want her to go back to her \"normal self\" but isn't her normal self the chatty one with the hypothetical questions you hate? Can't you just politely ask her to tone them down somewhat?

How much time does she spend on this? Hypothetical questions and conversations around them most often than not are argument baits and honestly, I don't find the habit cute or quirky at all.\n\nI don't get all the vitriolic YTA judgements either. You bottled in the annoyance and frustration till you reached breaking point. Honestly, that's your only fault here. And believe me, even a rational conversation about this would have ended the same way.\n\nIn short, NTA, OP. You had enough. You snapped. You're not going to hell for it.", "Have you ever heard of the 16 personality types/MBTI? Just the way you\u2019re describing this, your girlfriend is using those questions, through her primary cognitive functions, to understand the world. My guess: she\u2019s an INTP and she\u2019s bringing all this seemingly abstract information in to play because it\u2019s giving her a more and more accurate understanding of you. There\u2019s nothing more fun in the world to an INTP than honing a hypothetical argument for no reason. \n\nYou, on the other hand, don\u2019t think it\u2019s fun because it\u2019s not feeding your intellectual or emotional need. Some other topic would work for you though, and I bet if you give her suggestions for what you\u2019d like to do or talk about, she\u2019ll be up for trying it. \n\nNAH.

Here are a couple of others: did you ever wonder if your girlfriend asked you these questions for any reason OTHER than because she is/was needy? Did you ever ask? Did it ever occur to you that she enjoys talking to you because you\u2019re her partner and she likes you? Do you typically assume that others are doing things you find objectionable in order to annoy you? Are you willing to occasionally start assuming good intent? Better yet, are you willing to make that your standard assumption? Or even to stop assuming entirely and ask for clarification or motivation when you\u2019re unsure? \n\nBiggest question, though there are a lot more, probably: do you even like your girlfriend? Because she was being her \u201cnormal self\u201d. Asking questions is so normal to her, in fact, that she owns a book of suggested questions. \n\nYou might not actually like her, bud.

The problem is obviously with the gf. So he puts her down, is mean and rude so she can learn her place and be the perfect doll. Except when she gives him what he wants ands makes herself smaller and less to fit his requirements, he STILL complains that she isn't good enough. If only she was normal ie the very personality he told her he hated. He has her coming and going. The gf could twist herself like a pretzel trying to please him and it would never be enough.
