My brother brought my nephews (4 and 8) over as well.\n\nI used to wear my engagement ring all the time but lately I keep it in my walk in closet and mainly wear it for special occasions. While I was cleaning up the dinner table, my nephews went to go play while the adults were still in the outdoor patio/outdoor kitchen area. My brother was not supervising his kids.\n\nDuring this time, my nephews went into the master bedroom without anyone knowing and started playing with everything. Including my engagement ring. When we came to look for them, they paniced because they know they aren't supposed to be upstairs, ran into the master bathroom and flushed my ring.\n\nWe called a plumber in case it was somehow in the u trap of the toilet and not actually gone. But nope. Unfortunately it was gone for good.\n\nWe still had the original receipt, so I called my brother. I emailed him a scanned copy as proof of the cost and asked him to reimburse me for the ring my nephew flushed. Immediately he started calling me an asshole because we were family and he was just a child. He has refused to repay the cost of my ring.\n\nI told him I will be taking him to court for this and now my entire family is blowing up my phone saying family shouldn't sue each other and just let it go.\n\nEdit: No, the ring was not insured. I found out the day after my nephew flushed it. My husband says he forgot and in the end never actually insured it.\n\nEdit 2: My brother says he does not have the money to repay even $100 per month and has refused any kind of repayment plan. He said I live in a nice enough house and if I want a replacement, I should just sell my car.\n\nEdit 3: My brother, to this day, has not truly apologized. It was a Canadian sorry. Sorry, not sorry. He said kids will do what is normal for kids, and they shouldn't be held responsible for a ring.

Im not sure how well off your brother is, but if hes not rolling in it like you are i wouldn\u2019t be asking him to pay you back for it as for someone with a lot less money its quite financially damaging. If youre worried about the principle then have his kids come over for a couple months and be chore slaves to teach them a lesson.", "I love how this post carefully inserted every detail to enhance her image of wealth.

You chose not to insure it, you chose to keep it unlocked, and you chose to have something that valuable and attractive out of sight with kids in the house. Freaking suing! \n\nI mean, go right ahead. Get that judgment, if you can. I\u2019m not really sure you will prevail, though, and maybe hope it doesn\u2019t get to a jury. You\u2019re never gonna see the thirty grand or that side of your family again. If that\u2019s cool with you, then that\u2019s what you should do. \n\nI kind of think you come off as a little nuveau riche. You use language here that suggests to the reader that you are constantly thinking about wealth, status, and \u201cvalue.\u201d You can\u2019t tell a story about a dinner party without making three separate references to your above-average dwelling, and not only do you *have* a $30k ring, you somehow care about it enough to keep the receipt but not to insure it. I\u2019m puzzled frankly. \n\nThere is going to come a time when you are in need in some way, and it won\u2019t be about a piece of jewelry. Probably won\u2019t be monetary, though I don\u2019t know, sometimes people who obsess over money do manage to lose it all anyway. No matter how wealthy you are, though, someday your parents are going to get sick, or your husband or your kids or you, and at that point you aren\u2019t gonna be thinking about how much more money you could have if you hadn\u2019t wasted so much of it on people and family. You\u2019re gonna want people that you know and love to be around you. What is that worth to you? Would you rather have $30,000 today, or your brother and his kids and their kids visiting you when you are old and/or sick? \n\nThat\u2019s not really the choice, by the way, because you aren\u2019t going to actually get the $30k either way. If you sue him, you might win. I don\u2019t think you will, but you might. And then you\u2019re gonna take that judgment and do what with it? His insurance isn\u2019t gonna pay it. He doesn\u2019t have that kind of policy. Are you going to execute a lien on his house? Does he even own real property? Maybe he does, and maybe you\u2019ll be able to collect when his kids go to sell it after he dies. And that will be how you find out he died, too. More likely he doesn\u2019t, though, and maybe you\u2019ll get the sheriff to garnish his wages, and maybe you\u2019ll get some of it that way. Maybe you\u2019ll even get the full thing, minus your lawyer\u2019s third of course so you get a whole $20k, and all it cost you was your family. \n\nThis is my personal opinion, not legal advice. But I\u2019ve spent enough time in litigation to know that\u2019s how it goes. The legal outcomes are uncertain. The fact that it is nuclear relative to your family is not. You absolutely will never see your brother or his kids again. You may not see much of your parents or other siblings either. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna render judgement, I think you\u2019ve gotten the validation you wanted anyway. But I just want you to make this next move knowing the costs. I\u2019m not sure that every lawyer you will talk to will explain that. Some are greedy, some are bored, some are sociopaths\u2026 most are not also mediators. Most aren\u2019t concerned about relationships. But enough of us are. \n\nBest of luck.
