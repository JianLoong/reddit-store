{"id": 14645, "submission_id": "12k3w80", "title": "AITA for asking my brother to pay $30,000 for my engagement ring?", "selftext": "I hosted a family dinner over the weekend. My brother brought my nephews (4 and 8) over as well.\n\nI used to wear my engagement ring all the time, but lately I keep it in my walk in closet and mainly wear it for special occasions. While I was cleaning up the dinner table, my nephews went to go play while the adults were still in the outdoor patio/outdoor kitchen area. My brother was not supervising his kids.\n\nDuring this time, my nephews went into the master bedroom without anyone knowing and started playing with everything. Including my engagement ring. When we came to look for them, they paniced because they know they aren't supposed to be upstairs, ran into the master bathroom and flushed my ring.\n\nWe called a plumber in case it was somehow in the u trap of the toilet and not actually gone. But nope. Unfortunately it was gone for good.\n\nWe still had the original receipt, so I called my brother. I emailed him a scanned copy as proof of the cost and asked him to reimburse me for the ring my nephew flushed. Immediately he started calling me an asshole because we were family and he was just a child. He has refused to repay the cost of my ring.\n\nI told him I will be taking him to court for this and now my entire family is blowing up my phone saying family shouldn't sue each other and just let it go.\n\nEdit: No, the ring was not insured. I found out the day after my nephew flushed it. My husband says he forgot and in the end never actually insured it.\n\nEdit 2: My brother says he does not have the money to repay even $100 per month and has refused any kind of repayment plan. He said I live in a nice enough house and if I want a replacement, I should just sell my car.\n\nEdit 3: My brother, to this day, has not truly apologized. It was a Canadian sorry. Sorry, not sorry. He said kids will do what is normal for kids, and they shouldn't be held responsible for a ring. They were supposed to supervise their kids outdoors with the rest of the family while I was busy cleaning up.\n\nEdit 4: I don't believe for a second my brother and his wife cannot pay for the cost of my engagement ring. They don't make anything near my husband but they have a combined income of around 250k. They don't pay rent or anything because my parents gifted them their old house valued at 3.5 million in Toronto, ON, CA back when I bought my parents a new home years ago. There is no mortgage on the home my brother lives in. The only things my brother and his wife would have to pay for is the cost of raising their children, normal bills, and food. I feel so distraught because my ring holds great sentimental value. I've already been speaking with my husband's family lawyer, but at this point, I'm ready to hire a PI to find out if they really don't have the money.", "created_utc": 1681342418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k3w80/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_pay_30000_for_my/", "score": 10755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry, not sorry.\"\n\n\"Canadian sorry\"? YTA, you fucking bigot.", "ESH - but you already know that. You, for this:\n\n>No, the ring was not insured. I found out the day after my nephew flushed it. My husband says he forgot and in the end never actually insured it.\n\nSo it's *your* ring, but everyone else around you is responsible for keeping it safe? And you have no responsibility at all? \n\nYour husband for not insuring it as he promised.\n\nThe 4 and 8 year olds have the responsibility for being 4 and 8.", "As a Canadian, I don\u2019t think you understand the expression Canadian sorry\n\nAlso, that\u2019s a crazy story. \nYes he\u2019s responsible for his kids\nYes you should have insured the ring \nBut 30k that\u2019s a shit load to ask\nHe should be sorry and apologize. \nBut your ring is not insured. Something else could have happened. \n\nI never understood why people wore 30k ring to begin with.", "This sounds almost identical to the makeup story from like two days ago. I don\u2019t believe it. \nEven if it\u2019s real, why would a 30k ring just be sitting out in the open for anyone to grab? Sounds like an idiotic thing to do honestly.", "Esh\n\nif you can afford a $30,000 engagement ring (and not even use it) then you can afford to not not have $30,000. The only people who spend that amount of money on a ring are people that have ridiculously expendable amounts of money. Im not sure how well off your brother is, but if hes not rolling in it like you are i wouldn\u2019t be asking him to pay you back for it as for someone with a lot less money its quite financially damaging. If youre worried about the principle then have his kids come over for a couple months and be chore slaves to teach them a lesson.", "I love how this post carefully inserted every detail to enhance her image of wealth. Not her closet, her *walk in* closet. Not the patio but the *outdoor patio/outdoor kitchen area.* Not \u201cmy room\u201d but \u201cthe master bedroom.\u201d\n\nAnd now you are suing your brother over something that you took bo precautions to prevent. You chose not to insure it, you chose to keep it unlocked, and you chose to have something that valuable and attractive out of sight with kids in the house. Freaking suing! \n\nI mean, go right ahead. Get that judgment, if you can. I\u2019m not really sure you will prevail, though, and maybe hope it doesn\u2019t get to a jury. You\u2019re never gonna see the thirty grand or that side of your family again. If that\u2019s cool with you, then that\u2019s what you should do. \n\nI kind of think you come off as a little nuveau riche. You use language here that suggests to the reader that you are constantly thinking about wealth, status, and \u201cvalue.\u201d You can\u2019t tell a story about a dinner party without making three separate references to your above-average dwelling, and not only do you *have* a $30k ring, you somehow care about it enough to keep the receipt but not to insure it. I\u2019m puzzled frankly. \n\nThere is going to come a time when you are in need in some way, and it won\u2019t be about a piece of jewelry. Probably won\u2019t be monetary, though I don\u2019t know, sometimes people who obsess over money do manage to lose it all anyway. No matter how wealthy you are, though, someday your parents are going to get sick, or your husband or your kids or you, and at that point you aren\u2019t gonna be thinking about how much more money you could have if you hadn\u2019t wasted so much of it on people and family. You\u2019re gonna want people that you know and love to be around you. What is that worth to you? Would you rather have $30,000 today, or your brother and his kids and their kids visiting you when you are old and/or sick? \n\nThat\u2019s not really the choice, by the way, because you aren\u2019t going to actually get the $30k either way. If you sue him, you might win. I don\u2019t think you will, but you might. And then you\u2019re gonna take that judgment and do what with it? His insurance isn\u2019t gonna pay it. He doesn\u2019t have that kind of policy. Are you going to execute a lien on his house? Does he even own real property? Maybe he does, and maybe you\u2019ll be able to collect when his kids go to sell it after he dies. And that will be how you find out he died, too. More likely he doesn\u2019t, though, and maybe you\u2019ll get the sheriff to garnish his wages, and maybe you\u2019ll get some of it that way. Maybe you\u2019ll even get the full thing, minus your lawyer\u2019s third of course so you get a whole $20k, and all it cost you was your family. \n\nThis is my personal opinion, not legal advice. But I\u2019ve spent enough time in litigation to know that\u2019s how it goes. The legal outcomes are uncertain. The fact that it is nuclear relative to your family is not. You absolutely will never see your brother or his kids again. You may not see much of your parents or other siblings either. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna render judgement, I think you\u2019ve gotten the validation you wanted anyway. But I just want you to make this next move knowing the costs. I\u2019m not sure that every lawyer you will talk to will explain that. Some are greedy, some are bored, some are sociopaths\u2026 most are not also mediators. Most aren\u2019t concerned about relationships. But enough of us are. \n\nBest of luck. I hope that you find peace in this situation.", "YTA simply for saying it was a Canadian sorry.

Maybe if he actually parented the kids, they wouldn\u2019t be doing something so incredibly stupid.

But to flush a $30k ring down the toilet, I mean, the parent needs to do something. I'm angered not by the accident but more on the nonchalant attitude of your brother who is totally not apologetic at all.\n\nHe needs to at least discuss with you on the payment plan and work it out with you, instead of just dismissing you completely. It is partly his fault for not taking care of his kids.", "I'm going to go with NTA on this one, but it weighed on me.\n\nI agree that the brother was supposed to be watching the kids, and the kids wandered off in a house that wasn't theirs. The kids shouldn't have been anywhere in the house unsupervised. \n\nIf this ring was 30,000, a monumental cost for anyone in the working class, why was it in an unlocked, unsecured space? I mean, aside from insurance on the ring, why wasn't the ring in a lockbox or safe? Why was something that expensive unsecured?\n\nSo yes, I agree the kids should have been supervised. Your brother is responsible for them, and they lost your ring. Your brother should at least cover half the cost of the ring. Covering his half of the responsibility. The other half should be covered by the person who invited children in her house and not securing a $30,000 ring. \n\nIf I was a judge (which I am absolutely not), that's how I would call this one.", "I don't understand how an 8-year-old and a 4-year-old know they should flush things down the toilet when adults come back?

It\u2019s something that\u2019s easy to get lost and one of the most valuable things a lot of people own - it\u2019s silly not to pay the small amount extra for insurance over it. \n\nPlus if something is worth THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS you should store it in a safe or a safe deposit box at the bank if you aren\u2019t going to be wearing it!", "I have my cello insured similarly, that\u2019s what it can cost \n\nDepends on whether it\u2019s covered outside the house or anywhere you take it, whether it\u2019s covered for just theft, or accidental damage etc. They all add to the premium", "A safe still needs insurance and usually has an insurance \u2018limit\u2019. We have one bolted to the garage floor with gemstones, jewellery, important docs, etc. They\u2019re a deterrent but not infallible!", "It is a common issue on this sub to have people claiming insurance (paid by others) should be a get out of consequences card for them.\n\nAnd responsibility of some (there should have been a liability insurance, kids should have been supervised and better educated: This warrant a NTA) does not remove responsibilities of others (jewelry should have been locked and insured).", "After having kids I've had so, so many \"there's a sentence I never thought I'd have to say\" moments. Because kids do dumb shit. All the time. It's their basic setting. And when panicked or scared, it takes a whole new level of dumbness.", "Yeah they just somehow figure out by their teen years that replacing vokda with water won't be noticed at all.", "I also learned early. My grandmother used to flush mashed potatoes down the toilet and then blame me for the clog. \n\nThe only reason it didn't work was because my parents knew I hated potatoes so much that I wouldn't have even touched them to get rid of them.", "Seriously! I used to get yelled at for not flushing my poop! I was scared to clog the toilet so I wouldn\u2019t flush! All behavior learned from parents\u2026maybe they can\u2019t afford it because their drug habit is too expensive", "From what I\u2019ve been told, it\u2019s actually quite common for children to have a fascination with the toilet flushing. \n\nThey don\u2019t understand it, so they\u2019re trying to understand it the only way they know how, putting stuff in it and flushing it.", "I dunno, I'm not exactly well off, but if I had a ring worth that much I feel like the first thing I'd do is insure it. But I wonder (and I don't mean this in a bad way) if when you have a lot of money maybe insuring it wasn't something they felt they needed to do right away? I could be wrong but maybe that's it? Or I'm just talking out my ass I don't know I'm really tired.", "I was shocked by how much my contents insurance went up when I got a quote to add my engagement ring.  I don\u2019t have it insured for outside the home because it was so expensive.  I might have it insured for at home loss.  My ring was much less than $30k but the insurance was more than 1-2% of its value (I don\u2019t remember exactly. It\u2019s been a while.). Things that I imagined when looking at insurance: losing it while wearing it (unlikely, it fits pretty snugly), getting mugged (unlikely, not impossible), or getting robbed.  I did not consider \u201cniblings playing in wardrobe and flushing ring\u201d.", ">\tI\u2019m not exactly well off, but if I had a ring worth that much I feel like the first thing I\u2019d do is insure it\n\nI think a lot of that comes from the fact that you\u2019re not rich enough to think of 30k as \u201cyeah it\u2019s a lot of money, but if I lose it, whatever\u201d. Having money really warps your perspective of what each dollar is worth. Think about how precious a $20 bill was when you were a kid vs what it means to you now", "That is exactly what I was trying to say lol thank you for putting into understandable words what I babbled about!\n\nThat's exactly it. 30k is a ton of money to me. TBH if someone had gifted me a ring worth that much I'd never wear it for fear of losing it.", "They can have whatever they want in their own home. The brother should control his kids. Sure accidents happen. Flushing a ring down the toilet is NOT an accident.", "You could say the same about her brother not getting personal liability insurance, especially if he has kids. If my kids do something daft like flush a 30k ring, I have insurance to cover it. It's weird that this isn't a cultural norm in the US", "Everyone is talking about the ring being insured and I\u2019m here wondering if the brother has personal/family liability insurance? I would never have children without making sure their underdeveloped brains were insured.", "Contact the jewelry store and ask about the replacement policy. They might have something like cost on rings bought there.", "And who would be liable for the missing ring? Insurance would call op brother to court for it.", "Why would you insure something nonessential that you can afford to replace and why on earth would that change the responsibility?", "It is the point because it still.woyld have gone to court over that amount just via insurance not OP", "\n>YTA for walking around with a 30K liability\n\nThat's the point. They didn't walk around. They left it in their room.", "God I have a book that\u2019s worth \u00a38000 and that thing is in a locked glass display case and insured. The ring definitely should have been. In fairness to OP though. She does say that she didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t insured", "This crossed my mind too! And she got punished anyway, and then Marilla found the brooch behind the furniture, lol.", "PLOT TWIST!!!!", "Wealthy people don\u2019t insure individual pieces of jewelry because they can afford to replace them. Insurance mitigates risk, it\u2019s for things you cannot afford to lose. OP can easily replace the ring, they just don\u2019t think they should have to because it is not their fault.", "Because insurance more often than not costs more than the benefits you receive. That's how the business model works.", "I really don't get the people calling you an ah for not having it insured, just feels very victim blame-y. They weren't allowed in the room and they were aware of it. The parents were aware of it too. It's 100% on them.", "Some insurance companies even want a separate itemised list for collections even if it's just a bunch of cds or books of no particular individual value \nI learned that when I was getting quotes to see if I could get a better price by changing companies.", "Maybe they shouldn't be having kids then if they can't take responsibility for their children.", "I'm on my second ring because of that! The diamonds started falling out of my first, so rather than it fall to pieces we chose a second ring together.", "God I wish you were right. My 10 year old nephew is the type to do such a thing. His mom's at her wit's end. She has no idea what to do with him.", "Idk, that part isn\u2019t that odd to me. My father was a jeweler and 30k pieces weren\u2019t unusual for some of his clients. He\u2019s done many less expensive, and some much more expensive. \n\nGiven OP bought the parents a new house in one of the most expensive housing markets and the old one worth 3 million was just gifted to the other child, something tells me a 30k ring isn\u2019t out of reach here. \n\nAlso saying that their combined income of 250k isn\u2019t as much as OP\u2019s husband makes I can definitely see a 30k ring.", ">8yo definitely doesn\u2019t know enough to flush diamonds because the concept of monetary value probably hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\n\nThey may not understand the monetary value of the ring but they should understand in that age that it's a thing and you don't flush things found in others' rooms.", "Haha my original engagement ring/ wedding band was $500. 3 years later I saw a ring set on Etsy for $300 that I fell in love with and sent the link to my husband. He bought it and reproposed to me on our bucketlist trip to the worlds largest cave and now I have 2 rings to pick from. To me, it\u2019s much better than having one super expensive ring", "It's not so much the $30K ring by itself.  It's triangulating:\n\n1. Having enough money to buy a $30K ring BUT\n2. Not having enough financial sense to get a $30K ring insured BUT \n3. Keeping a receipt for an engagement ring BUT\n4. Making so much money that \"Pfff, $250K isn't near my husband\" AND\n5. Coming from a family rich enough to gift multi-million dollar homes (In what I also understand to be one of the most expensive real estate markets in North America at the moment, so probably much more than that now) BUT \n6. Being sufficiently low in funding for the brother to say \"Well sell your car\" AND\n7. For the brother to claim with the remotest hope of being believed that he can't afford any kind of payment AND\n8. For the supposedly super high-earning husband who fucked up the insurance to not just go \"My bad, I'll cover the cost, I can easily pay it out of my bajillion dollar salary\" AND\n9. To make a big point of how much irreplaceable sentimental value the ring had, which could never be recovered and meant the monetary benefit of the insurance didn't matter BUT\n10. Be absolutely dead set on getting the monetary value of the ring out of the brother, come hell or high water, because apparently the monetary side does actually matter.\n\nSome of those things co-existing I could believe.  ALL of them co-existing just sounds to me like someone took a (probably wildly embellished) snippet of a lower-to-middle class lifestyle, multiplied a bunch of numbers to what they thought would fulfill a weird fantasy of wealth, and just didn't bother to think about how nonsensical that made the rest of it.", "What messed up world do we live in where 2.5k for a piece of jewellery can be considered \"only\"?", "No problems. 1st engagement ring... We discussed our wedding rings before we got engaged and designed them together. I made an engagement ring to compliment her wedding ring and proposed with it. (18ct yellow sapphire and diamond carved half hoop)\n\n2nd engagement ring. Before we got married, my wife occasionally worked in the shop that I was a manager of (DONT RECOMMEND, when she did something wrong, she went from being my staff member to my partner in a nanosecond and zo ended up in trouble with her lol) She then discovered she really loved platinum, so I made her a platinum wedding ring set with diamonds with a matching plain wedding ring to compliment.\n\n3rd engagement ring. I was head hunted to where I work now. I'd taken a massive paycut (I quartered my salary) to move up North to be with her and get married. Being head hunted, my wages effectively went back up to what I was earning before I moved. I then made her a platinum trilogy ring. She now has a platinum engagement ring (the trilogy) wedding ring and half eternity (the ring that was the engagement ring) \n\n4th engagement ring. I upgraded her trilogy ring to bigger stones and a 2 stone Cross over (1carat each stone). The 3rd ring was gifted to her brother for him to propose to the mother of his kids (we stopped contact with him the next year but still have contact with the mum of his kids) \n\n5th. The one she lost. Another trilogy ring. I remade the 4th ring using the 2 1 carat stones and a larger centre diamond. \n\n6th engagement ring. I remade her mum's trilogy ring (smaller stones but better quality, D colour) The centre stone I made into a pendant with angel wings in memory of her mum. The outer stones, I added to a large tanzanite. That was for her 50th last year\n\nI'm waiting for the next request lol. I have told her about a 3 carat diamond I'm able to get (3 carat E colour VVS1) at a discounted price from my supplier. \n\nThing is, this is my job. So I've never paid more than trade for the materials and obviously, don't charge myself for making them. It's my own fault, I do remember telling her, \"I can't promise you flowers but I can promise you diamonds\" and the bugger has never forgotten...", "You should have a fireproof one for things like passport/birth certificate/etc. Mine was like $50 lol it doesn't have to be a bank vault", "Maybe! Ours is  about big enough for maybe three hard cover books and we keep important papers in it and portable hard drive backups of computer files. Nothing sexy or fun.

Is it worth insuring 2 months worth....eh maybe not so much.", "My aunt is no longer friends with one lady, at least partially because I flushed her diamond earrings as a child, so little I don't remember it. Me and her daughter were just playing and didn't understand, but that doesn't mean we should have been playing with those expensive ear rings. But at the same time, it's the adults responsibility to secure it. In a closet counts as secure, those children have 0 business being in OPs closet.

Also, why did she put the responsibility on the husband to insure it? Your hand, your ring. It's your responsibility to make sure it's covered. That much money could literally pay off my mortgage. Insane to spend that much on something you can easily lose, or in this case, flush. Brothers' kids are total goblins though! \n\nCan a claim be filed on the home owners insurance? It was property in the home that was essentially stolen by unsupervised children? The messages to the brother and his refusal to pay is proof it was taken. I'm not a wiz when it comes to coverage rules. Brother is absolutely responsible.

Absolutely all of this. \n\nNTA. \n\nI\u2019ll even go a step further and add that I\u2019d personally never have my brother and his family anywhere near my property again.
