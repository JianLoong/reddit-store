Sounds like she was trying to make you complicit in her screwing with someone's wedding. Nope nope nope", "NTA but please I\u2019m gonna need an update after the wedding lol", "NTA.\n\nYour mom plans to disrespect the bride and the groom by doing this. I have to wonder, is the close co-worker the bride or the groom? If that person is the bride then your mom is kinda fake. If it's the groom, same thing", "NTA. This is some odd behaviour. You as a 15 year old shouldn\u2019t be the one telling her not to wear white to a wedding\u2026 and for her to say that no one really likes the bride anyway makes me think she has some sort of alterior motives. Definitely NTA and seems like your dad has just heard one side of the story and doesn\u2019t want to be involved.", "NTA - Your mother did raise you to be better than that. Hence your refusal to help her wear white to another person's wedding. I'm curious why a 36 year old woman needs a 15 year old's opinion to buy a dress. Your dad's request that you go back and help is is weird, what \"help\" does she need. (Does she really want to dress like a 15 year old girl?)", "NTA!! Wow, the best words to describe your mother are: immature, childish and rude. Is there any way to find out the name of the employee to warn the bride-to-be via Facebook or other social media platforms?", "So basically since you're \"only\" 15 you are not supposed or even allowed to think by yourself and have / express an opinion ?? NO you definitely can't wear white to someone's wedding. Your mom should know better !! Her attitude is very toxic. She has to apologize to you. But let her wear that dress anyway. She'll understand when it backfires and she gets all the looks and remarks at the wedding. She'll look like a fool but that's on her. You warned her. She refused to listen. Not your problem anymore. NTA", "NTA, info: Is this a close co worker of your or your moms. If this is a close co worker of yours I would tell both parents she needs to get a new dress now or you are telling the co worker because you don\u2019t want any problems at work due to your moms behavior. That is a legitimate concern in a work environment and would not be wrong. If it\u2019s your moms co worker let her deal\nWith the after math I guess. But remind both parents it won\u2019t be pretty.", "Your mother is the AH!", "Thought this was gonna end with mom getting shotgun wedding", "NTA at all. I'd be awfully tempted to walk by her with a glass of grape juice of black coffee (cooled) when she's finally in that dress, pretend to trip, and spill that shit all over the front of the dress. You'd be doing the bride a huge service, and possibly your own mother, as her disrespectful, childish prank might not go over as well as thinks it will.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is being petty and manipulative and looking to cause drama at this co-worker's wedding", "NTA, your Mom sure is though.", "NTA your mom is pulling some petty moves with your coworker and is trying to make you complicit. Good on you for refusing to participate! Your dad needs to tell her off, but probably won't unfortunately. Weird thought but is there any way you can somehow tip off the coworker?       \n      \n\"I'm so excited for the wedding! Mom got a white dress, which I thought was a little weird, but she checked with you first right?\" or similar.", "NTA, but is your mother always this much of a train wreck?!Refusing to become involved in her drama is wise.\n\nIs ditching your mother wise? I have no idea - if you have a safe way home then probably not. It\u2019s a like\u2026 5% AH move (it\u2019d be higher if she wasn\u2019t being awful), so on the scales I say you are NTA for ditching her.
