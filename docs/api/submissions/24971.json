Evelyn loves her grandparents (my in-laws) and talks to them regularly. My in-laws have been pressuring us to pay them a visit for a while now during these calls. They often argue that we travel an awful lot due to my interest in different cultures and it wouldn't kill us to go see them.\n\nNow I don't have a great relationship with my in-laws. We're just fundementally different people and they don't accept my differences. However, when do go to see them as a family I try my best for everything to go smoothly. It rarely does.\n\nAshley is really busy with work. So am I. Evelyn has been asking us to go see her grandparents. My in laws are asking to see Ashley and Evelyn. So what Ash and I came up with was the idea for Evelyn to fly to her grandparents, stay there for a week or two and come back home.\n\nWe bought a whole lot of gifts, went through packing with Evelyn (She already knows a lot about it since we travel a lot) and informed my in-laws of the visit. She was so glad to be able to fly alone and we told her everything she needed to know. And we followed standard procedure for everything. Sent in the documentation, etc. Now we clearly said Evelyn was coming to see them and they somehow interpreted it as the three of us. \n\nSo I got a call from my MIL who was extremely angry that I let a six year old go on a plane alone without parental supervision (even though she already picked up Evelyn without any problems as we had previously arranged). She called me all kinds of names including a selfish person and a horrible mother. It took every bit of self control I had to not return those kind remarks.\n\nWhen I told Ashley about all this she was so angry that she took a day off of her crazy work schedule to go get Evelyn and come back home. This created a huge drama in the entire family (when Ashley got Evelyn her extended family were all at my in laws to see her). And I am getting all kinds of messages from Ash's side saying I created a divide among loving parents and their daughter.\n\nI honestly didn't think I did anything that would make me TA but after all the messages I just want to know what strangers think. Am I an AH?\n\nEdit: Yes we did inform my ILs that Evelyn would be coming alone. We told them multiple times actually because well it was the first time our daughter would be travelling alone. We followed procedure about the paperwork, them needing to bring IDs, etc. They raised the concern about her travelling alone after they picked her up from the airport with no problem.", "created_utc": 1692386367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15utmex/aita_for_making_my_daughter_fly_alone_to_see_her/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just assumed you did, but then you say yr MIL was angry w/you, so maybe she didn't know? If not \u2014 why didn't you prepare her? \n\nWhy is yr MIL calling you to talk to you about the issue and not her daughter? And why are people saying you \"created a divide\" when Ashley obviously signed off on it?\n\nIt's not that big a deal for kids to travel alone. My neighbor does it all the time w/her kid when she sends him to see his father. You get clearance to go thru TSA w/yr kid, even if you don't have a ticket, hand them off to the staff working the flight, who take the kid to whoever is meeting them at the other end.", "NTA, sending kids on planes like this is pretty usual.. That's why there is service like this.\n\nYour in law parents were propably angry because they realised they have to take care of her for a whole time and it doesn't look already like a great visit for them.\n\nUnfortunately you were not there to Defend yourself so they can tell anything to their family.\n\nBut definitely not the asshole for me.", "NTA Why the hell are they calling you instead of their daughter? Why is everything your fault and no blame on Ashley? I don't think Ashley should have immediately gone and got her because I think it looks bad she could take time off work to do that but not visit her family and I also think it exacerbated the problem. Ashley should have just called them and put them in their place. That being said I am sorry you have to deal with in laws like this and I hope your daughter wasn't too upset by having to leave the planned trip early.", "NTA.  I've read your comments - sounds like you did it all right, and your MIL is just unhinged.  I'd no longer be facilitating a relationship between her and your child if your wife isn't there to protect her.  Definitely no more solo visits.", "NTA unaccompanied minors are a thing and she has nowhere to run to on a plane. She was excited to see her grandparents and she has been on planes before.", "NTA\n\nThere is something else going on with your in laws. It\u2019s not for me to say if it\u2019s a matter of control issues, anger issues, or what, but there is definitely something very off with them and it has nothing to do with you or your family.\n\nTraveling as an unaccompanied minor has been a thing for a long time. It\u2019s not like you launched her into a situation unprepared and completely alone. There was a professional there to keep an eye on her and keep her safe.", "NTA, and you need to coordinate with your wife about dealing with her parents, so you can deliver a \"come to Jesus\" message to her family together where they start treating you better or some sort of consequences will be enforced (up to, and including, going NC if your wife is on board).\n\n> they somehow interpreted it as the three of us.\n\nYou darn well know that's not really possible.", "NTA you where clear on what was happening them not understanding is not your fault. you where also very safe and did everything right to make this happen and make sure she understood and had everything she might have needed.", "NTA. You tried to do the best for you, your wife, your kid and even for your IL. If you ask me they are the selfish ones that did nor understood you can't go, but you want to let them to have a great time with their niece.", "NTA - the airlines have outstanding policies for unaccompanied minors, and it sounds like your daughter was 100% on board.  I've sent my kids that way several times and while it was nerve-wracking, it went perfectly fine.  ESPECIALLY if you can do direct flights.\n\nI don't really understand how it got to that point without your in-laws knowing that she was coming by herself, that sounds like a communication issue.\n\nYour wife sounds like she might have gone a bit zero-to-sixty, but I'd let her fight that battle.", "NTA, but this is a very weird situation. Why would your in-laws yell at you and not at their own daughter? And why didn't your wife clearly communicate with them, did not she need to tell them anything about your 6yo's routines, likes and dislikes etc.? I can't imagine just sending my kid to someone without discussing all the details of his stay, that was irresponsible. As for sending your daughter on the plane alone...Personally, I'd never do that kind of thing without a really serious reason, this is a small kid, all kind of staff can happen. So while this whole thing is mostly on your wife since it's her parents and thus ultimately her desicion, the parenting choices you both made are quite questionable.", "NTA - here\u2019s what happened. Your in-laws were never cool with Evelyn flying alone but they didn\u2019t want you to cancel her trip. So they waited until they had her in custody to tell you how they truly felt, and make YOU the bad guy by pretending they misunderstood the whole time. They also clearly don\u2019t like you for some reasons so it\u2019s an easy way to release their anger. \n\nThey\u2019re manipulative jackholes and I see why you don\u2019t want to visit them.", "NTA", "First time I flew I was 11 going to Disney.  I always saw flying as an adventure (especially since it was never a luxury my family could afford growing up).  I'm sure the kid will be fine.\n\nI can see why you dislike the in-laws.  They sound insufferable.\n\nJust tell them they can see the kid or they cannot.  And if they don't like your arrangement they can go fuck themselves.  After all, you're doing them a favor letting them see your daughter.  You don't have to.\n\nETA NTA", "NTA. And I\u2019d be willing to bet that the \u201ctraveling alone\u201d is not the actual issue. You allude to your in-laws not accepting your \u201cdifferences.\u201d Smells like homophobia to me. They won\u2019t come right out and say that they don\u2019t accept you and instead pick fights about other things. Your daughter\u2019s trip was a \u201cgreat\u201d opportunity to do this again. \n\nCan your wife run interference with her parents so they don\u2019t lash out at you any longer?", "NTA, but I think you didn\u2019t communicate appropriately with your in laws. \n\nI would have done a triple confirmation in that they were okay taking care of the girl for a full week without you both there.", "~~I'd say Y T A for not making it clear that the daughter was flying alone; it was a the kind of miscommunication one is more likely to see in a sitcom than in real life. It's also a Y T A because a six year old still requires a fair measure of attention and supervision; you really need to let the in-laws know that they're expected to entertain the kid the entire week or two-week period.~~\n\nThe thing the fight is ostensibly about - the flight - is the smallest concern. On an airplane is probably one of the safest places for an unaccompanied minor; airport security is very strict, and the airlines have clear procedures to make sure that the kid leaves with the person they're supposed to leave with.  \n\n\nEDIT: Per OP's updates and other comments there is no possible way the in-laws got the kid from the airport without knowing the situation ahead of time. OP is NTA; if the in-laws had an issue with the kid travelling alone they could very well have brought it up BEFORE the flight.", "Did you inform the airline that she was travelling alone, and register her through the unaccompanied minor program? \n\nThey have procedures in place where the child is supervised during the entire trip, and has to be picked up and dropped off by the pre-authorized people. If you just dropped a little kid at an airport and hoped for the best you would definitely be the asshole, but i honestly don\u2019t think they would let a kid that young board a plane alone if it wasn\u2019t pre-arranged. If you followed the protocol you aren\u2019t an asshole, but you maybe should have specified to the grandparents that you were sending her alone. Most people wouldn\u2019t expect a kid to travel alone, and would be concerned if they didn\u2019t know that airline staff was keeping track of her the whole time.", "NTA. They misunderstood. But they should have called their daughter to discuss the matter instead of you, especially when your relationship is strained. Loving parents are kind to their children\u2019s spouses. And, if they wanted Evelyn to stay, they shouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal about it.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nWhat grandparent thinks that parents would send their 6 year old unaccompanied on a plane? No wonder they were surprised! Asking a 6 year to navigate such an undertaking is ridiculous.", "Yikes.\n\nYTA not for not wanting to see your in laws but yes. This wasn't a life or death situation. You just... didn't want to go.\n\nYour daughter clearly loves your in laws. You don't have to. If you don't want to visit them ever then invite them to visit Evelyn at home\n\nThere were solutions here that wasn't this.", "YTA who let's a little kid go by themselves like damn she's 6 you not worried about all the things that can happen to her ??", "How could this possibly happen? Your ILs did not know they were meeting a 6 yo at the airport? Something went seriously wrong here. \n\nESH", "Yta I can\u2019t imagine getting a 6 year old travel alone because you are busy with work. Why couldn\u2019t the grandparents come to you?", "Yta what type of parent sends their 6 year old kid to fly by themselves", "ESH I mean I wouldn't send a 6 year old alone anywhere, but if she already arrived safely what was the point of yanking her back, poor kid. Grandma is not a lot better with the accusations when she'd known what the plan was all along.", "ESH\n\nWith your In-laws, it just sucks being pressured to see/visit people. I know it\u2019s a culture thing, but honestly if they wanted to see your family that much then why can\u2019t they visit you?\n\nWith you and your wife, it sounds like no one was very clear to the in laws that it was just your daughter traveling. That is terrifying the thought of what could have happened. What if your in laws were late, unable to make it, etc? Your daughter would have been alone at an airport for however long.", "You... sent a 6 year old on a flight by themself and your wife was unaware this was happening? WTF?\n\nYes, YTA. And, apparently so is your wife if she is so detached from day-to-day life of her 6 year old that she had no idea you sent her alone and didn't think to wonder why you were home and not away visiting.", "ESH, kids can travel solo if you make all the necessary arrangements. (And have a kid who can handle it. Sounds like Evelyn can) However the communication in this situation is obviously lacking on so many levels. Did Ash not tell them Evelyn was getting picked up early? How did your in-laws not understand that Evelyn was flying alone? (My kids have flown alone, the adult at the other end always gets a gate pass and meets them at the gate.) And your in-laws blowing up your phone calling you a terrible parent is not the way to handle their end either. I just feel bad for Evelyn. Poor kid just wanted to see grandparents and have a cool travel experience.", "If was easy enough for one of to just stop work and pick up Evelyn, why couldn't one one you take her and the other drop her off? Or Ashley go twice? I'd be so worried the entire time I wouldn't be able to see straight!\n\nAnd what escalated the whole thing was then cutting the trip short - for which you and Ashley are YTA. You could have de-esculated the whole thing by saying that you'd rethink letting Evelyn fly by herself until she is older (and your not having her fly by herself to visit anytime soon) and then picking her up at the appointed time. Instead, you/Ashley caused a rukcus family disharmony, and probably cost yourself extra money by picking Evelyn up early.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The rest of the fam acting as the chorus, dramatically swirling around and gasping in horror on cue.\n\nWhat a \ud83d\udca9 show. You all deserve better than this.", "NTA. When your in-laws call or text you to complain or blame you for something, hand them off to your wife. If they insist on talking to you, \"I'm sorry, that won't be possible. Here's Ashley.\" Block the extended family. Ashley needs to take the lead on dealing with her family. That will only work if you both refuse to let them go around her to get to you.", "The way forward is clear.  Groveling apology from MIL or no more granddaughter time.  You being nice and accommodating didn\u2019t work.  NTA", "Info: How did the 6yo handle the flight? I\u2019m wondering if she was crying when they picked her up.", "Any chance  MIL has some quiet & long term homophobia & unleased it when she could?", "NTA, I flew as an unaccompanied minor at 6 twice a year to visit my dad literally across the country. I survived and enjoyed it", "What airline lets a 6 year old child fly alone?!\n\nOne. of you could have flown the kid out then returned, and your inlaws could have flown her back and then gone home. IMO, six is waaaaay too young to fly alone. \n\nYTA", "NTA. If you and Ash agreed together to send Evelyn alone, why are you getting all the blame?", "6 is a wee bit young.  I could understand 12, or maybe even 10. But 6?     \nNope.  I agree with your MIL on this.  That's too young to be flying alone.", "Wtf. I have petty argument parents and id never have my SO deal w them. Gotta SHIELD your partner from your fam craziness. NTA; your kid was fine w it.", "All of them? This isn\u2019t new. They don\u2019t \u201cfly alone\u201d they get on the plane accompanied by a flight attendant, sit with the attendant the whole flight, and exit the plane with the attendant. They then walk the child to the proper adult who is picking them up.  What country are you in?", "Nta Ashley needs to have a good conversation with her parents and maybe threaten nc.", "NTA\n\nYou and your wife did nothing wrong and there are many kids that fly unaccompanied from this age and perhaps even younger.  Evelyn was obvious comfortable enough to do this and probably had a great adventure and looked after by the flight crew.  Your inlaws were also very aware of what was happening.\n\nI gotta say that your wife did the right thing by going and picking Evelyn up when they had their tantrum.\n\nAnd you didn't create a divide between your inlaws and you guys.  They did that themselves.  They aren't the loving parents you describe.  They sound controlling and they want things on their terms.  I'd also think twice about leaving Evelyn alone with them in all circumstances.  You already don't have a great relationship because they don't like different to them.  You will have no idea what they would be saying to Evelyn which would be confusing her to and it can go very pear shaped if they manage to alienate Evelyn from you and her mom in some capacity.", "NTA, and please, please don't let these people to be in contact with your daughter anymore. It is immensely traumatizing for the kids when grandparents badmouth one of the parents. Not even when Ashley is present. I've seen what it does with emotional and mental development of a child, it's devastating and ruins their life.", "She should get a call forwarding app for her phone and send all their calls to her wife. (After discussing it with wife, of course)", "So your solution is do what the inlaws want and suck it up?"]}
