She might also have to deal with venue rules.\n\nWhat you consider your dog to be has no bearing on the legality and rules of the venues. She gave you the option of attending without your pet. You told her you weren't going to go. That should be the end of it.

Certified or not- your dog is not a service animal.", "YTA- this most likely is beyond your aunts control too. Your dog has no legal rights to be anywhere public as ESA dont have the same rights as Service animals do.  The venues your aunt is using most likely have a no dog rule that would totally kick her out for breaking.", "YTA, Only trained service dogs are allowed at restaurants, churches and etc.  While you have a unofficial emotional support dog it does not have the same rights as a service dog.  Get yourself diagnosed before you do anything. Research what your country, state or region requires in a service dog.\n\nMy state requirements are a canine good citizen obedience award and 3 tasks that are related to my illness.  I live in USA.\nI am only required if ask to say yes, I am disabled and these are her 3 tasks.  \n\nMy girl knows many tasks, including potty on command.

However, I definiely don't think your aunt is doing anything wrong here and shouldn't be blamed. People have allergies, people are afraid of dogs, there will be lots of people there...it's a recipe for a potential disaster, especially since they only have your word that it's a \"good dog\" (and that you consider it to be like an ESA frankly doesn't matter. He's not certified as a service animal).\n\nYour mom is right; it's entirely your aunt's call. If you hold this against her, then YTA.", "YTA. Your dog is not a therapy dog, it doesn't have the training, so yeah. She doesn't know how it will react. She has every right not to allow a non-service animal to be at the wedding to potentially piss, shit, and nip at people.

It\u2019s not a service dog. It is your pet. Pets often offer comfort to their owners, however that doesn\u2019t meant owners should be allowed to start taking them everywhere just because they feel uncomfortable. A lot of people are uncomfortable with dogs, so why should your need be greater?  I\u2019d suggest you look at therapy to find other coping mechanisms so you can be happier long term\n\nEdit to add your extra TA because I neglected to read the part about you don\u2019t think it will be fun. Who cares? It\u2019s your family. Grow up.", "lightly YTA. No problem asking, and there's nothing wrong with your aunt's boundary. But you're an asshole for insisting and trying to convince your aunt after she said no. A wedding is just such an ordeal to plan, and is complex enough as is, bringing a dog is another complication. \n\nShe's right, there are many situations where even a registered ESA wouldn't be allowed. You'll either have to avoid those places forever, or come up with some alternative strategies. Maybe you can invite a support person as your +1? Tour the venue ahead of time to get a sense of the space? Ask if there will be a space away from the main gathering area where you could recharge?", "**YTA**\n\nThe question was asked and answered; it isn't your wedding, so now you have to choose whether you'll attend or not.\n\nHowever you view your dog, he isn't trained to be a service dog/ESA.

Whether you decide to go to the wedding is another issue entirely.", "To be a doctor you have to get an MD, a lawyer you have to get your JD, to be a teacher you have to get a teaching credential, to be a contractor you have to get a contractors license, to be a bus driver you have to get a class A license, and a service animal has to be trained and certified to perform a service, even if that service is emotional support like for folks with PTSD etc.\n\nAn emotional support animal is just a pet that you lie about. YTA and you are making it harder for people with real service animals to go about their daily lives.", "Facts are that you should not get used to anyone anywhere allowing you to bring your dog. Even if he acts as support for you the fact is he is not trained to be a service animal. Consider how stressed he could become in an environment like that. Loud, crowded and he will likely get a lot of attention from people wanting to pet him. \n\nYou are going to have to get used to being in public without him and you aren't doing yourself any good by hiding at home. I get it. I had terrible anxiety too and it took me a long time to build courage but you can do it. \n\nYou should start small. Start going out alone to the convenience store, the library. Places you can be alone and blend in. Then someday you'll be ready for an event like a big wedding.", "YTA, I\u2019 would\u2019ve said the same thing at MY wedding. He isn\u2019t certified as a ESA therefore he isn\u2019t allowed. Now had maybe he been then maybe she\u2019d be the AH. Again it\u2019s her wedding that she and her future husband paid for so what they say goes. But sorry, hope your mental health improves", "YTA.  Most wedding venues dont allow animals unless they are official service dogs.  Also many people have allergies to dogs and your dog being there could trigger people's allergies. More importantly, having a dog there would focus attention on the dog, not on the bride & groom/wedding ceremony.\n\nDo you take the dog to school with you?  If not then why would you need to have the dog at the wedding?  Im sure your school has more than 100 people.", "YTA- I have a registered ESA at my university. I had to get a letter from my therapist documenting mental illness, as well as a vet letter saying he is not a threat to others and is healthy. \n\nEven then, ESA\u2019s are not service dogs. Service dogs are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act, if you are in the states, ESA\u2019s are not. \n\nIt is her wedding, your aunt owes you zero.\n\nEDIT: I do not think youre the AH for not going, that is your choice if you are not comfy with it. I think youre the AH for being upset with her about it", "If it's not an ESA, it's just a pet.", "Service dogs got through special training to get certified.  The training involves learning how to not interact with people except the dog\u2019s owner and on his command.  So, someone with a trained service dog can walk into a restaurant or church or whatever, and the dog will be invisible except to the people who can physically see the dog.  The dog is trained not to bark and not to react to people who might want to come up and play with him.  A service dog is also trained to read his owner for the specific disability like anxiety and react by comforting the owner.  A service dog is trained to communicate their needs by not barking.\n\nUntrained dogs will see all the people and want to play.  Untrained dogs don\u2019t know what to do when people come up and want to pet them,etc.  untrained dogs will bark when they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.  Your dog provides you with emotional support, but the dog is not trained to do this in places with lots of people or disruptions or where there is supposed to be quiet etc.  \n\nThere is a big different between a trained service dog going to a wedding, and an untrained ESA going to a wedding.  While both types of dogs provide the owner with support, a trained service dog will not disrupt anyone else and will not disrupt the ceremony, an untrained ESA will disrupt the wedding and be distracted by all the people because the dog is untrained.\n\nSo, you need to think about the needs of everyone else and not just your own when you want to take your untrained dog to places where animals aren\u2019t allowed.  You need to get therapy to help you learn to deal with your anxiety without the dog in places where dogs aren\u2019t allowed or you need to get a trained service dog.", "YTA for being insistent. Either you go without your dog *who is not certified*, or you don't go. You can't insist that they change their *likely very expensive, even \"cheap\" ones are costly* wedding for you, and you alone. \n\nAlso there's nothing wrong with you choosing to not go too. If you're not comfortable being away from your dog and are at risk of having an anxiety or panic attack then don't do that to yourself. If they insist that you still go- then they are being assholes as well.", "YTA\n\nIf the dog is not a certified ESA, it's a pet. Sorry, but there it is. Your aunt is correct to be concerned. If your dog caused damage or injured someone, she could be liable as the host of the event. Your say-so that the dog is fine in crowds does not constitute any real assurance for your aunt. \n\nI'm also going to add that you will not overcome your social anxiety while utilising your dog as a safety behaviour.", "YTA. If you have 100 people there, there will very likely be at least one person who is allergic, another person who feels uncomfortable around dogs, and especially at least your aunt is not ok with it. A dog is not a common encounter at a wedding. It is not acceptable that you expect others to suffer or feel unconfortable themselves, just so that you could bring your pet and make yourself feel better. You cannot off-load your issues onto others for your own benefit. \n\nIn invitation is a friendly offer to join. You are technically not in a position to make any demands.", "YTA. Not for asking if your dog can go. But for referring to it as a support animal and then for being upset because your request was denied. \n\nSupport animals do not qualify for the same exceptions made to Service animals (at least in most places). Yours is not even a support animal. It's just your pet. \n\nI train service dogs, a lot of work goes into not just preparing the dog to be \"good\", but also the owner to adequately handle the dog in different situations. The amount of heartache that this pandemic of fake support and service animals is causing to people that need service animals for their daily survival is horrendous.\n\nPlease find help for your anxiety from a professional. A pet is a great aid, but it's not a solution.", "YTA and spoilt. \n\nIts a pet. its not trained. This is someones wedding. \n\nYour aunt is right - you need to get use to going places without the dog or you need to go about registering (and training) the dog to be a Support Animal.", "Info: Is just not going an option for you? That feels like the best possible solution.\n\nI get that you have anxiety, but your aunt also has a right to not want a dog (one you admit **hasn\u2019t** been given proper training as a support dog) at her wedding, potentially barking, destroying things and causing a scene. Even the bestest bois can go a little nuts in a crowd.", "YTA. I totally get having social anxiety, and I don't find weddings too comfortable, either. But part of growing as a human is getting used to doing things that you might not want to do, or that would be difficult to do. It may be an uncomfortable six or so hours, but in the grand scheme of things, it's one of the most important days in your aunt's life. Look at it as an opportunity to get a bit more experience with uncomfortable situations, and give your dog a big hug when you get home.", "YTA, not for having anxiety, but for being unrealistic about what accommodations are reasonable for others to be expected to make.\n\nGo or don't go, as you prefer.  Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your choice.  Yes, consequences will happen even though you have reasons.  Your aunt may be hurt, and your mother may be disappointed, and they have the right to their feelings. Those feeling will color their relationship with you.\n\nYou need real support for your anxiety. Carting a pet dog everywhere isn't fair to the dog, the general public, or even to you in the long run.  \n\nPlease seek professional medical help to learn reasonable behavioral coping mechanisms and techniques and possibly get recommendations on dietary changes and/or medications. There are a lot of things you can do to improve the situation.", "Your pet makes you feel better, but it's not a service animal.  It's not even really an emotional service animal.  It's just a pet that you find comforting and your aunt (and the venue) are within their rights to say no.  You can decide to go or not based on her response.\n\nI would really suggest that you look into other ways to manage anxiety... my daughter and I both struggle with this and cognitive-behavioral therapy has been REALLY helpful.  It's always going to be better for you to have internal resources to fall back on rather than an external crutch.  A crutch can always be taken away, an internalized set of coping skills you will always have on hand.", "A host is in their rights to set the rules and tone of a venue.\n\nAn invitee is in their rights to decide to attend, or not.\n\nA host cannot judge for anyone not finding it in their liking to attend. An invitee cannot demand for rules to be changed just for them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t go without the dog, then don\u2019t go. However, demanding that the dog goes would make you TA.

An ESA will not be allowed in restaurants, grocery stores, etc.  I have been battling anxiety and depression for 24 years.

If it was medical equipment ( as true service dogs are classified ) , that would be different. But this is not that.\n\nGrow up and realize your dog is not a service dog.

I am on my second companion now but can say I am astonishingly more independent now thanks to all the work I've put in and consider my dog \"retired\" for the most part. Are you in therapy? Has a psych written you up as requiring an ESA? If not, you do not have an ESA. I can actually tell you don't have an ESA because you seem to think they need to be registered. They don't. They're not service animals. There is no registration or database for an ESA. You just need a written diagnosis/reccomendation preferably from a psych.\n\nThey're also NOT a permanent solution. This is also why I say your aunt is right. You NEED to learn to go to these things without your companion. You need to put in some work. They're not going to be around forever.\n\nIt does not sound like your dog is trained for these situations. Which is fine, ESAs don't require special training. But because your dog is not specially trained, it's inappropriate to bring them to such an environment. Aunt is right, you don't know how they're gonna react. Being well with people does not equate to being well around 100 people in a high energy situation.\n\nESA are not allowed to go everywhere with you. They don't have any true legal right to be in spaces such as libraries, grocery stores, etc. You need to learn to accept this now before you even consider trying to validate your need for an ESA. Right now, you're giving people who have legitimate ESAs a bad rep. \n\nDo things the right way, get therapy. Your aunt answered your question and you're just going to have to accept it. I do encourage you to attend and have a back up plan in case you can't handle it and need an exit. Companion will be waiting for you at home to process afterwards.", "YTA if your dog isn\u2019t trained as a service animal then you don\u2019t get to just pretend that they are a service animal", "Your aunt is entitled to her boundaries and she is likely bound to establishment boundaries. It just sucks but it is what it is. \n\nYour anxiety you will need to handle with professional help. I\u2019d like to share my experience to help you as well. Do what you wish with the info. But it\u2019s likely you have more to gain than to lose by testing these things. Please look into this as crazy as some suggestion sound. You seem to be in a desperate spot and I understand what this is like. \n\nHere is what immediately with anxiety and the advice I wished I received at my lowest spot. \n\nThese 5 things have continued to help me with my anxiety tremendously: (beyond therapy)\n\n1. Get off of birth control. \n\nfind a non hormonal alternative if you can ex- IUD. It may take years for your body to heal properly. \n\n2. Weed off soap with preservatives if possible - do not use oils, (coconut or otherwise )there is so much fraud it\u2019s shameful. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to stop using soap all together but my body is out of balance so I need it for my oily hair. Trader Joe\u2019s has a great grapefruit body wash that I sometimes use for hair too and it\u2019s the closest acceptable and easy alternative I\u2019ve found. \n\nYour skin absorbs more than you may realize.  (I\u2019ve had full blown panic attacks following the use of coconut oil idk how tf that\u2019s possible but I\u2019ve accepted it after experience)\n\n\n\n3. Keep a food diary. \n\nMonitor how you feel after certain foods even 24-48 hours later. AIP diets have helped people even without autoimmune issues namely because they fight inflammation. Another thing affecting people is food processing and preservatives. You\u2019d be shocked at how many greens/grains are tainted. I rarely eat greens I haven\u2019t grown myself due to this reason. If you suffer from acne this may be a symptom of inflammation and intolerance from food. \n\n4. Get at least 20 min of sun a day. \n\nThis affects more than you may realize and does affect hormones and mood drastically for many. (Controversial tip- after I stopped consuming and using seed oils I did not need sunscreen and I didn\u2019t burn. I would not believe it until I ran multiple tests myself. It\u2019s mind-blowing.) \n\n5. If you do not participate in sport start doing something regularly immediately. \n\nEven if you start with short walks. Exercise fights inflammation which large affects  anxiety. \n\n\n\nMore on my experience: \n\nI firmly believe food and substances are affecting us far more than we realize at younger ages than before due to the quality. I worked closely with top food safety authorities in the US. Our government and laws have failed us. We are a joke to so many in the world and even if you are not US based the practices have spread beyond the US and you may be affected. You don\u2019t need preservatives, many foods can be preserved with water salt and sometimes vinegar. Look up the processes. \n\nMy personal experience became highly noticeable due to a birth control- slowly until reality hit all at once. If you are BC one consider using an IUD instead. I used to lock myself in closets due to the anxiety. The inflammation was so bad my skin would burn at the slightest touch. Everyone around me thought I was on drugs to my young age when what I really needed was help. \n\nThis was a complete 180 from my typically overconfident take care of people self. I was first to make a fool of myself, first to laugh, first to make everyone around me feel good about themselves and try new experiences. I prided myself on this. It was such a change I blamed myself and I thought I was going insane. I lost all hope in life and my future I almost went to an extreme you cannot come back from. \n\nMy pets helped me tremendously at that time because my support network had failed me. But that\u2019s a band aid not a long term strategy. \n\nThat being said I have 5 pets now in my household and have no regrets. But I have had various life experiences I would not have been able to otherwise if I didn\u2019t take steps to improve my anxiety. \n\nIt sounds like your support network exists- use it. Seek professional help. Please try to be brave in the face of anxiety. Your comfort zone is not your friend here. \n\nA funny and helpful tip is to talk to yourself as if you were an athlete at a press event after a game. Relish in the wins, and don\u2019t allow yourself to beat yourself up in the losses. They aren\u2019t true losses. They are learning experiences and you walk away stronger. \n\nGood luck- you\u2019ve got this.", "Gonna go against the grain and say ESH because you're not obligated to go to a wedding if you don't want to, regardless of reasoning. If you feel too anxious to go without your dog, then you shouldn't have to go.\n\nHowever, it's not fair to be mad at your aunt for saying no either, because unless your dog is a trained service animal... you really don't know how your dog is gonna react to this new situation. Most dogs that aren't properly trained can feed off of their owners \"vibes\" as it were, not quite sure how to phrase it. But if you're getting highly anxious, combined with potential for a large overstimulating crowd (something your dog wouldn't be used to since you avoid large crowds)... That is just a recipe for disaster. \n\nIf you want to be able to use your dog like a service animal, you need to go through the proper channels and have your dog professionally trained. Even then, for personal events, some people are still going to say no. And in situations like that, you wouldn't be in the wrong for choosing not to attend.", "YTA.

You\u2019re making it difficult for people who rely on service animals due to disabilities in order to maintain a close to typical existence. \n\nIt\u2019s selfish. Apologize to your aunt.

Not wanting a dog at a wedding is pretty typical. \n\nHowever they should let you just stay home if the day is going to be a challenge.", "Ok. Here are a bunch of ways to handle a large family gathering:\n\n- Have a goal. It can be silly, like \"find out three ppls birthday\" or \" walk to the bathroom and back twice.\"  But give yourself a random task to do at the event. It gives you a reason to chat, move around, and pass time. Help ppl set up/ clean up/ etc. Keep busy.\n\n- Ask ppl a question about themselves. \"How do you know the bride/groom?\" \"How was your travel?\" Etc. Even a simple , \"How about you?\" as a volley.  Folks *love* to talk about themselves... then all you have to do is nod and smile. \n\n- Have an escape plan. My people call it \"the Irish goodnight\". Have a plan to dip if you get overwhelmed. Locate the family bathroom stall w a lock,pace in the parking lot, keep an Uber budget for emergency rides home.\n\nI'm being sincere and I hope this helps.
