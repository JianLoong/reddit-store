She might also have to deal with venue rules.\n\nWhat you consider your dog to be has no bearing on the legality and rules of the venues. She gave you the option of attending without your pet. You told her you weren't going to go. That should be the end of it.

Certified or not- your dog is not a service animal.", "YTA- this most likely is beyond your aunts control too. Your dog has no legal rights to be anywhere public as ESA dont have the same rights as Service animals do.  The venues your aunt is using most likely have a no dog rule that would totally kick her out for breaking.", "YTA, Only trained service dogs are allowed at restaurants, churches and etc.  While you have a unofficial emotional support dog it does not have the same rights as a service dog.  Get yourself diagnosed before you do anything. Research what your country, state or region requires in a service dog.\n\nMy state requirements are a canine good citizen obedience award and 3 tasks that are related to my illness.  I live in USA.\nI am only required if ask to say yes, I am disabled and these are her 3 tasks.  \n\nMy girl knows many tasks, including potty on command.

However, I definiely don't think your aunt is doing anything wrong here and shouldn't be blamed. People have allergies, people are afraid of dogs, there will be lots of people there...it's a recipe for a potential disaster, especially since they only have your word that it's a \"good dog\" (and that you consider it to be like an ESA frankly doesn't matter. He's not certified as a service animal).\n\nYour mom is right; it's entirely your aunt's call. If you hold this against her, then YTA.", "YTA. Your dog is not a therapy dog, it doesn't have the training, so yeah. She doesn't know how it will react. She has every right not to allow a non-service animal to be at the wedding to potentially piss, shit, and nip at people.

It\u2019s not a service dog. It is your pet. Pets often offer comfort to their owners, however that doesn\u2019t meant owners should be allowed to start taking them everywhere just because they feel uncomfortable. A lot of people are uncomfortable with dogs, so why should your need be greater?  I\u2019d suggest you look at therapy to find other coping mechanisms so you can be happier long term\n\nEdit to add your extra TA because I neglected to read the part about you don\u2019t think it will be fun. Who cares? It\u2019s your family. Grow up.", "lightly YTA. No problem asking, and there's nothing wrong with your aunt's boundary. But you're an asshole for insisting and trying to convince your aunt after she said no. A wedding is just such an ordeal to plan, and is complex enough as is, bringing a dog is another complication. \n\nShe's right, there are many situations where even a registered ESA wouldn't be allowed. You'll either have to avoid those places forever, or come up with some alternative strategies. Maybe you can invite a support person as your +1? Tour the venue ahead of time to get a sense of the space? Ask if there will be a space away from the main gathering area where you could recharge?", "**YTA**\n\nThe question was asked and answered; it isn't your wedding, so now you have to choose whether you'll attend or not.\n\nHowever you view your dog, he isn't trained to be a service dog/ESA. He's not equipped for the situation.

Whether you decide to go to the wedding is another issue entirely.", "To be a doctor you have to get an MD, a lawyer you have to get your JD, to be a teacher you have to get a teaching credential, to be a contractor you have to get a contractors license, to be a bus driver you have to get a class A license, and a service animal has to be trained and certified to perform a service, even if that service is emotional support like for folks with PTSD etc.\n\nAn emotional support animal is just a pet that you lie about. YTA and you are making it harder for people with real service animals to go about their daily lives.", "Facts are that you should not get used to anyone anywhere allowing you to bring your dog. Even if he acts as support for you the fact is he is not trained to be a service animal. Consider how stressed he could become in an environment like that. Loud, crowded and he will likely get a lot of attention from people wanting to pet him. \n\nYou are going to have to get used to being in public without him and you aren't doing yourself any good by hiding at home. I get it. I had terrible anxiety too and it took me a long time to build courage but you can do it. \n\nYou should start small. Start going out alone to the convenience store, the library. Places you can be alone and blend in. Then someday you'll be ready for an event like a big wedding.", "YTA, I\u2019 would\u2019ve said the same thing at MY wedding. He isn\u2019t certified as a ESA therefore he isn\u2019t allowed. Now had maybe he been then maybe she\u2019d be the AH. Again it\u2019s her wedding that she and her future husband paid for so what they say goes. But sorry, hope your mental health improves", "YTA.  Most wedding venues dont allow animals unless they are official service dogs.  Also many people have allergies to dogs and your dog being there could trigger people's allergies. More importantly, having a dog there would focus attention on the dog, not on the bride & groom/wedding ceremony.\n\nDo you take the dog to school with you?  If not then why would you need to have the dog at the wedding?  Im sure your school has more than 100 people.", "YTA- I have a registered ESA at my university. I had to get a letter from my therapist documenting mental illness, as well as a vet letter saying he is not a threat to others and is healthy. \n\nEven then, ESA\u2019s are not service dogs. Service dogs are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act, if you are in the states, ESA\u2019s are not. \n\nIt is her wedding, your aunt owes you zero.\n\nEDIT: I do not think youre the AH for not going, that is your choice if you are not comfy with it. I think youre the AH for being upset with her about it", "If it's not an ESA, it's just a pet.", "Service dogs got through special training to get certified.  The training involves learning how to not interact with people except the dog\u2019s owner and on his command.  So, someone with a trained service dog can walk into a restaurant or church or whatever, and the dog will be invisible except to the people who can physically see the dog.  The dog is trained not to bark and not to react to people who might want to come up and play with him.  A service dog is also trained to read his owner for the specific disability like anxiety and react by comforting the owner.  A service dog is trained to communicate their needs by not barking.\n\nUntrained dogs will see all the people and want to play.  Untrained dogs don\u2019t know what to do when people come up and want to pet them,etc.  untrained dogs will bark when they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.  Your dog provides you with emotional support, but the dog is not trained to do this in places with lots of people or disruptions or where there is supposed to be quiet etc.  \n\nThere is a big different between a trained service dog going to a wedding, and an untrained ESA going to a wedding.  While both types of dogs provide the owner with support, a trained service dog will not disrupt anyone else and will not disrupt the ceremony, an untrained ESA will disrupt the wedding and be distracted by all the people because the dog is untrained.\n\nSo, you need to think about the needs of everyone else and not just your own when you want to take your untrained dog to places where animals aren\u2019t allowed.  You need to get therapy to help you learn to deal with your anxiety without the dog in places where dogs aren\u2019t allowed or you need to get a trained service dog.", "YTA for being insistent. Either you go without your dog *who is not certified*, or you don't go. You can't insist that they change their *likely very expensive, even \"cheap\" ones are costly* wedding for you, and you alone. \n\nAlso there's nothing wrong with you choosing to not go too. If you're not comfortable being away from your dog and are at risk of having an anxiety or panic attack then don't do that to yourself. If they insist that you still go- then they are being assholes as well.", "YTA\n\nIf the dog is not a certified ESA, it's a pet. Sorry, but there it is. Your aunt is correct to be concerned. If your dog caused damage or injured someone, she could be liable as the host of the event. Your say-so that the dog is fine in crowds does not constitute any real assurance for your aunt. \n\nI'm also going to add that you will not overcome your social anxiety while utilising your dog as a safety behaviour.", "YTA. If you have 100 people there, there will very likely be at least one person who is allergic, another person who feels uncomfortable around dogs, and especially at least your aunt is not ok with it. A dog is not a common encounter at a wedding. It is not acceptable that you expect others to suffer or feel unconfortable themselves, just so that you could bring your pet and make yourself feel better. You cannot off-load your issues onto others for your own benefit. \n\nIn invitation is a friendly offer to join. You are technically not in a position to make any demands.", "YTA. Not for asking if your dog can go. But for referring to it as a support animal and then for being upset because your request was denied. \n\nSupport animals do not qualify for the same exceptions made to Service animals (at least in most places). Yours is not even a support animal. It's just your pet. \n\nI train service dogs, a lot of work goes into not just preparing the dog to be \"good\", but also the owner to adequately handle the dog in different situations. The amount of heartache that this pandemic of fake support and service animals is causing to people that need service animals for their daily survival is horrendous.\n\nPlease find help for your anxiety from a professional. A pet is a great aid, but it's not a solution.", "YTA and spoilt. \n\nIts a pet. its not trained. This is someones wedding. \n\nYour aunt is right - you need to get use to going places without the dog or you need to go about registering (and training) the dog to be a Support Animal.", "Info: Is just not going an option for you? That feels like the best possible solution.\n\nI get that you have anxiety, but your aunt also has a right to not want a dog (one you admit **hasn\u2019t** been given proper training as a support dog) at her wedding, potentially barking, destroying things and causing a scene. Even the bestest bois can go a little nuts in a crowd.", "YTA. I totally get having social anxiety, and I don't find weddings too comfortable, either. But part of growing as a human is getting used to doing things that you might not want to do, or that would be difficult to do. It may be an uncomfortable six or so hours, but in the grand scheme of things, it's one of the most important days in your aunt's life. Look at it as an opportunity to get a bit more experience with uncomfortable situations, and give your dog a big hug when you get home.", "YTA, not for having anxiety, but for being unrealistic about what accommodations are reasonable for others to be expected to make.\n\nGo or don't go, as you prefer.  Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your choice.  Yes, consequences will happen even though you have reasons.  Your aunt may be hurt, and your mother may be disappointed, and they have the right to their feelings. Those feeling will color their relationship with you.\n\nYou need real support for your anxiety. Carting a pet dog everywhere isn't fair to the dog, the general public, or even to you in the long run.  \n\nPlease seek professional medical help to learn reasonable behavioral coping mechanisms and techniques and possibly get recommendations on dietary changes and/or medications. There are a lot of things you can do to improve the situation.", "Your pet makes you feel better, but it's not a service animal.  It's not even really an emotional service animal.  It's just a pet that you find comforting and your aunt (and the venue) are within their rights to say no.  You can decide to go or not based on her response.\n\nI would really suggest that you look into other ways to manage anxiety... my daughter and I both struggle with this and cognitive-behavioral therapy has been REALLY helpful.  It's always going to be better for you to have internal resources to fall back on rather than an external crutch.  A crutch can always be taken away, an internalized set of coping skills you will always have on hand.", "A host is in their rights to set the rules and tone of a venue.\n\nAn invitee is in their rights to decide to attend, or not.\n\nA host cannot judge for anyone not finding it in their liking to attend. An invitee cannot demand for rules to be changed just for them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t go without the dog, then don\u2019t go. However, demanding that the dog goes would make you TA.
