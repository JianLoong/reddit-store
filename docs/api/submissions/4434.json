We were living together, but I had planned to spend most of December with my parents and younger sister in my home state since my father is in poor health. Typically I don't talk to my family much, but I wanted to spend the holidays and my sister's birthday there because we don't know how many months my dad has left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome background: My late bf and I struggled with substance abuse issues in the past, but we were sober when we met and were very supportive of each other's recovery. My parents are extremely judgmental about mental illness, addiction, etc. They are anti-therapy, anti-meds. When I told them I was dating someone I met in NA, they immediately started badmouthing him. My mom texted me constantly asking if we had broken up yet. A few months after that I went pretty LC with them with guidance from my therapist, but they knew we were still together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I came back to my parents' house, my bf seemed a little depressed. We talked and he assured me he was just sad he wouldn't see me for a few weeks but he'd be okay and he was spending more time with his family. One morning his mom called me. He was supposed to meet her for brunch and never showed, and he wasn't answering the door. She called the police and got into the apartment, where he had OD'd and passed away, probably after getting off the phone with me the previous night. The shock still hasn't worn off yet, so I apologize if this comes across as cold or unemotional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was invited to the funeral in his home state where we were living. I told his mom I'd be there, and I can help with anything she needs. I booked a flight and then told my mother what happened. At first she laughed, I guess thinking I wasn't serious. Then she realized I was, and started yelling about how I was choosing a \"dead junkie boyfriend\" over my family, how she was right all along about him being a loser. When I didn't back down, she backtracked and said she was just concerned I was going to relapse since my mental state was so fragile and I couldn't handle making the trip alone. She insisted on coming with me \"for my safety\" and I snapped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said she never liked him when he was alive, she hated our relationship, and she's never made an effort to understand my issues so why should I believe that she's concerned now. I told her I didn't want her there while I'm grieving with others that actually loved him, and her attending would be disrespectful to his memory. She was shouting at me while I walked away, but she hasn't spoken to me since. Since then my father and sister have said I was too harsh and she really was concerned for my well-being. My sister informed me that my mother expects me to apologize for losing my temper. I know I have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to my mom because of how rocky our relationship has been in the past, and it's hard for me to see when she's actually trying to help versus doing things for herself.

Your mom's reaction to hearing about his death was to attack you. Don't let her get anywhere near that funeral.", "NTA. Your mom was utterly disrespectful towards him and expects you to want her \"help\" and support during his funeral? Absolutely not. Your mother seems rude, judgmental and callous, and not good for your mental state. Keep her far away from the funeral, and from you for that matter. You deserve better than to be treated like that and so did your boyfriend. I'm so sorry about your loss, and I hope that you lean into your true support system during this hard time.", "NTA - I am so sorry to hear about your boyfriend. That must be so very difficult and I hope you have lots of support from friends and your bf\u2019s family.\n\n\nYour mother sounds very toxic, frankly, and in light of her behaviour both when you told her about the funeral and for what sounds like your entire life, she got off extremely lightly here.\n\nI think you would be much \u201csafer\u201d without her, tbh. If you are worried, you\u2019ve got your therapist who will *actually* help you.\n\nI hope the funeral goes as well as it can. Please do take care. Lots of love to you.", "NTA. Your mother doesn\u2019t see the humanity in addicts. You have every right to grieve the loss of someone you loved who lost their battle with a vicious, cruel thing, and I would do the same in your shoes.\n\nFrom one recovered addict to another, please, please do everything you can to get through this without using. It\u2019s not worth throwing away your progress to numb this out. If you *do* use, please do it safely and remember that your tolerance has decreased in your time sober. \n\nI hope things are easier for you, and soon. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your loved one.", "NTA so sorry for your loss. When people tell you who they are, believe them.

May his memory be a blessing to you and his family.\n\nPS: Go NC with your mother and LC with other members of your family during this time. Be with people who actually support you.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSo let me get this straight. In your family, whenever you have a perfectly justified reaction to your mother violating your boundaries, she harasses other family members behind the scenes to get you to apologize on her behalf.\n\n\nAND her tendency to switch tactics, backtracking when she realizes she slipped up by using a bit too much sociopathy in an attempt to suddenly seem \u201cconcerned\u201d, is something you\u2019re already familiar with because of just how often it happens?\n\n\n\nAND the way you were treated by your parents more than likely contributed to your own substance issues in the past,\n\n\n\nand when you meet a like-minded person who\u2019s probably been through the same things that you have, your mother immediately begins running her mouth, projecting her own shortcomings onto him,\n\n\nAND sees his death as a personal victory.\n\n\n\n\nAnd STILL, even despite all that, you still see this as a \u201cnuanced\u201d situation where you\u2019re somehow partially in the wrong? \n\n\n\nWhen are you going to demand your due respect? If this situation isn\u2019t the final nail in the coffin, I don\u2019t know what will be.\n\n\n\nNo more bullshit. No more family members taking her side and then turning around pretending to \u201ccare\u201d about you, no more being convinced that you need to answer for how you responded to abuse, no more being everybody\u2019s punching bag, and no more feeling like you have to justify and explain your own feelings.\n\n\n\nIf they don\u2019t show you the respect that you are owed, they can go fucking FUCK themselves.\n\n\n\nThe fucking AUDACITY they have, even in this situation to try to gaslight you into think you should APOLOGIZE?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. ARE THEY OUT OF THEIR FUCKING MIND. HOW IN FUCK DOES THAT MAKE A GRAIN OF SENSE?\n\n\n\n\u201cToo harsh\u201d my fucking rectal cavity. Are they fucking delusional? If something like this happened to me, I\u2019d be kicking down their door DEMANDING a one-sided apology on MY behalf. Not theirs. Fuck them.", "NTA. First of all I\u2019m really sorry for you loss. And for the situation- You have just lost your partner, are in chock and grieving. What you should have gotten from you mom was love and support. Even if she did act out of concern for you, the reaction was not helpful one bit. She might have had all the good intentions in the world in her resentment of your relationship, but that is not important right now. She did not know him, she judged him and your relationship without making an effort to get to know him. I really understand that you would not want to have her with you during the funeral. I hope you will get the support that you need though this.", "NTA omg your mom is so dismissive of your grief. Your SO literally died and all she had to offer was laughter (???) and wanting to control whether you are alive or not. \nShe didn't try to comfort you, and expects you to be on your best behaviour even after learning about your bf passing away ?\nI understand why you tried to cut them from your life, they look like they don't love you as who you are, but as who you could be if you were their little pet. They should be welcoming you in every twist and turn of your life. Loving you _unconditionally_ means even when you screw up or do everything as they say. \nAnd here you didn't even screw up, you just had someone in your life they disagreed you being with.\n\nI hope it doesn't come out as harsh or disrespectful in the way I formulated things. I'm truly sorry for your loss and I hope you can find comfort and grieve with his family.\n\n[Edit : I accidentally posted my comment while still typing it, so I finished my sentence in edit]", "NTA. sending you a big virtual hug. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I sincerely hope everything gets better for you.", "NTA but I hope someone can be with you to make sure you\u2019ll be okay during all this. Just not your mom.", "NTA. At all. She hasn't been respecting you or your feelings at all, but expects you to bow down to her completely inappropriate request. Then, when you don't, she expects an apology? Again, NTA.", "Definitely NTA.  If she didn't respect the relationship and doesn't have enough decency to hide her opinions of him and the relationship you guys had so soon after his death, she doesn't deserve to get an invite.", "No, you are definitely NTA. Youe mother is, though.", "Thank you all so much for your comments.\n\nMy flight is tomorrow morning and I'm all packed and ready to leave. I'm not planning to apologize or really interact with my mother at all while I'm still here, and I haven't booked a return flight yet because I want to deal with the apartment sooner rather than later (bf's mom offered to pay his share of the rent until I can find a new place).\n\nI'll be attending meetings frequently and I have a great sober support system there, which I'm very thankful for. I'll also be talking to my therapist about reducing contact with my family again.\n\nMy mother definitely will NOT be at the funeral. She does have a track record of showing up to places unannounced and uninvited, but she doesn't know any of his family members, she doesn't know his last name, and I'm 100% certain she doesn't remember what city he's from, so I doubt she'd be able to find out any details about the service.\n\nAgain, thank you all so much for your love and support. This has been enlightening-- I have trouble reminding myself of intent vs impact when it comes to people I love, but you all are right and I deserve better than being surrounded by toxicity.", "I think expecting an apology from your daughter who has just suffered an extremely upsetting and unexpected event is rather cold. Even if she didn\u2019t deserve your reaction (and she did), it should be put down to grief. NTA", "NTA. Strangers on the internet who have never met you or your boyfriend are showing more sympathy for your loss. Your own mother has no sympathy for your pain. Take that information and erect appropriate boundaries between your mother and your mental health, one of them is no good for the other.", "NTA, and don't see where she has any reason or right to be there anyway. Clearly, not her son and definitely not supportive of him in life.\n\nAnd given her behavior, probably need to go LC again until you can work through your grief and issues through therapy.", "NTA but honestly it sounds like your mother might be a source of what led you where you ended up and may be time to consider whether being around her at all is good for your health.  She's made it abundantly clear that she only gives a damn about herself with these actions.  \"She expects an apology\" for her antagonizing you Intentionally.  \n\nLet's see if this is even a question with a parallel scenario shall we.  Someone actively insults you about something you're sensitive about, then when you yell at them for it they demand you apologize for yelling at them.  Would you allow such a person to remain a part of your life?  Would you feel they are someone who will help you maintain a solid mental health?  So why allow your mother someone who should be treating you Better then this theoretical stranger to treat you Worse?", "NTA \n\nthis is YOUR time to grieve.  I'm guessing that even if she did manage to hold her tongue at the funeral it would be very stressful for you - instead of being a comfort you'd be constantly worried if she'd say something cruel to your BFs family members whether it was intentional or just insensitive. \n\nHopefully she is genuinely concerned for you, but also you are the person dealing with the loss of a SO, peoples emotions are are all over the place when this happens, your mom should give you some grace.  \n\nTake care of yourself, and your mental health.  Even if your 'fine' get back to meetings, and let the people who genuinely care for you know whats going on, and let them help you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
