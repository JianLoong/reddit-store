He brought it up today, and I told him I didn\u2019t apply. I recognize that\u2019s was a fuckup on my end for not following through on the request, and that upset him a bit. I said I like what I have here- I have a steady start to my career, a dog, a car, and some friends too that I could lean on if anything were to happen. His main reason why he wants me to move, is so that I would be apart of the kid\u2019s life, which is obviously not an unreasonable thing to ask.

What happened is that brother and his partner made the active decision to uproot their life and move far away. Also they did not include OP in this decision making. They obv didn\u2019t need to, it\u2019s their life and their decision. But it goes some way to show that OP is not seen as someone to take into account but that has to obey and tag along and if not it upsets brother. Very strong NTA OP. It sounds healthy to me to stay where you are happy and still continue to have a good relationship with them and the baby by indeed being there on birthdays etc and further carve out you own little corner on earth.
