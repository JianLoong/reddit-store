{"id": 24864, "submission_id": "15tqs1u", "title": "AITA for not sharing my inheritance with the rest of my \u201cfamily\u201d?", "selftext": "My family situation is messy. I (25F) was engaged four years ago to my high school sweetheart.  My fianc\u00e9 cheated on me with my sister (28F).  We had never had a good relationship even as kids, so after I found out, I went scorched earth both of them. She was \u201cso in love\u201d with my fianc\u00e9, but he dumped her within two weeks and was back trying to get me to forgive him (I didn\u2019t). My parents were initially on my side, but my sister had a nervous breakdown after she was dumped and was hospitalized so they changed their tune to \u201cit\u2019s over now and you can\u2019t be mad for ever\u201d. So I dumped them, too, and went to grad school on the other side of the country.\n\nMy grandfather was livid with the whole thing, disowned my sister, and chewed out my parents. Sometimes it felt like he was the only one who was on my side and understood. I was able to get my job to let me work remotely and moved back to take care of him when he got sick last fall and I was devistated when he passed a couple of months ago. I had been in limited contact with my parents since I came back mostly because I didn\u2019t want to be an obstacle to my dad seeing my grandfather, but with the understanding that any discussion of my sister or what happened would end that.\n\nIt turns out that my grandfather left me virtually everything. He left enough for my father to cover a debt and some token stuff for a couple of other relatives, but he wrote a letters for everyone and did a video tape with his attorney explaining what his intentions were. I knew that he had done well for himself, but he lived a pre simple lifestyle so I didn\u2019t realize how much money and assets he really had. I would give it all up to have my papaw back but even after taxes it is set for life money.\n\nMy parents are pretty mad about it. One of the reasons stated for cutting them out was how disappointed my grandfather was with how they had treated me growing up vs my sister and over the fiance debacle. There were other reasons, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re fixated on. The will is pretty airtight apparently, so my parents want me to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and share it equally between me, them, and my sister. Their argument is that I don\u2019t need it. I make more than both of them combined and this would allow them to retire. My sister is not doing great and can\u2019t hold a job, so this would ensure she has something for when my parents pass.\n\nI don\u2019t want to. My grandfather\u2019s wishes were crystal clear, and also I kind of don\u2019t feel like doing more than the minimum for any of them. They\u2019ve been telling me that I\u2019m being vindictive because of a mistake years ago. I can\u2019t deny there might be a little vindictiveness there. I don\u2019t want them to suffer necessarily, but I also don\u2019t feel like they deserve my help.", "created_utc": 1692286105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tqs1u/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_the_rest/", "score": 5456, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I (25F) was engaged four years ago to my high school sweetheart.  My fianc\u00e9 cheated on me with my sister (28F).  We had never had a good relationship even as kids, so after I found out, I went scorched earth both of them. She was \u201cso in love\u201d with my fianc\u00e9, but he dumped her within two weeks and was back trying to get me to forgive him (I didn\u2019t). My parents were initially on my side, but my sister had a nervous breakdown after she was dumped and was hospitalized so they changed their tune to \u201cit\u2019s over now and you can\u2019t be mad for ever\u201d. So I dumped them, too, and went to grad school on the other side of the country.\n\nMy grandfather was livid with the whole thing, disowned my sister, and chewed out my parents. Sometimes it felt like he was the only one who was on my side and understood. I was able to get my job to let me work remotely and moved back to take care of him when he got sick last fall and I was devistated when he passed a couple of months ago. I had been in limited contact with my parents since I came back mostly because I didn\u2019t want to be an obstacle to my dad seeing my grandfather, but with the understanding that any discussion of my sister or what happened would end that.\n\nIt turns out that my grandfather left me virtually everything. He left enough for my father to cover a debt and some token stuff for a couple of other relatives, but he wrote a letters for everyone and did a video tape with his attorney explaining what his intentions were. I knew that he had done well for himself, but he lived a pre simple lifestyle so I didn\u2019t realize how much money and assets he really had. I would give it all up to have my papaw back but even after taxes it is set for life money.\n\nMy parents are pretty mad about it. One of the reasons stated for cutting them out was how disappointed my grandfather was with how they had treated me growing up vs my sister and over the fiance debacle. There were other reasons, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re fixated on. The will is pretty airtight apparently, so my parents want me to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and share it equally between me, them, and my sister. Their argument is that I don\u2019t need it. I make more than both of them combined and this would allow them to retire. My sister is not doing great and can\u2019t hold a job, so this would ensure she has something for when my parents pass.\n\nI don\u2019t want to. My grandfather\u2019s wishes were crystal clear, and also I kind of don\u2019t feel like doing more than the minimum for any of them. They\u2019ve been telling me that I\u2019m being vindictive because of a mistake years ago. I can\u2019t deny there might be a little vindictiveness there. I don\u2019t want them to suffer necessarily, but I also don\u2019t feel like they deserve my help.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The will cuts out two of my siblings for things that they did to our parents in the past.  The will also handsomely bestows everything else upon the remaining siblings.  We are settling the estate several years after both my parents' passing.\n\nThe two disowned siblings have accused the rest of us of \"influencing\" our parents to distribute assets lopsidedly.\n\nThat was not the case.  I was in the room when my mom dictated her will to her attorney, and I know the acrimony that was in her tone as she said where each asset was to go, and why.  She was absolutely adamant about how she wanted things to be, and why it would be this way.  She actually listed incidents in the will itself, as a reminder, just in case some siblings \"forgot\".  I had those words ringing in my ears as I watched one disowned sibling, bawling like a banshee in a very awkwardly public display of grief, try to throw herself into the casket of our deceased mother during the wake.  \n\nWe siblings have all heard the same accusations and pleas, and have even heard the whole \"challenge the will\" spiel if the disowned siblings do not get what they want.

Right now, we're getting threats that they will make life hard for the rest of us.  Hell hath no fury...Especially when assets are involved.

It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks is \"fair\" (profitable) or not.  Tell your family that the will is being executed exactly as your grandfather stipulated, because it was his property to leave in the first place.  \n\nOne last thing...Once the shock of loss fades, you'd be surprised at how cut-out family members start talking about things like fairness and \"the right thing\", even as those same people are the ones who hightail it to the estate of the deceased as quickly as possible to try to steal anything that isn't nailed down or locked up tight.

Tell them about the safety fund so they stop yelling.\n\nI can't really find a way to broker peace without holding the money over their heads so you may need some proffesional council for that.
