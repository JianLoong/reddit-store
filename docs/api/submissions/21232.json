I've been living with my roommate since April and most of the time I keep to myself. I mean, we get along but as days progress, there's a lot of stuff that I'm not okay with that's brushed under the rug. Like my roommates kid eating all my food or my roommate using my food to cook meals for \"all of us\" (me, her, her kid, her husband) because she works really long hours and doesn't have time to go to the grocery store (in her defense, they are closed usually when she gets off work and she truly has no time before she goes back in to work because most of her shifts are 12-16hours). She's been shaving back my rent by $150 because she eats my food but like.. the food I've bought that's been eaten is way more than that. And she also feeds all of them before calling me down to tell me dinner is done and there is usually hardly anything left because these guys eat easily 4x a normal portion amount. \n\nAnyways, my mom asked me to go there for 2 weeks because she needs someone to watch her dog while she does her yearly conference meetings. She's going to be either mostly away or will be getting in super late so she doesn't have time for her dog right this second. I told her I would. I left yesterday and when I left, I took 90% of the food I bought with me. This included at least $300 worth of meat and easily another $200 for perishables/pasta/veg. I didn't have to take that much because realistically, I won't eat that much during the 2 weeks I'm gone but a huge part of me just doesn't want them eating all my food when I'm gone either because this was NOT the deal we made when I moved in. We were supposed to be cooking separately but after I allowed her to use my food a couple times after she asked, she just started using it constantly without asking. Her husband can't go to the grocery store due to having a recent (2 months ago) back surgery. I left enough for a couple days, just so they could figure it out. \n\nAnyways, I got a text this morning around 4am (when she gets home from work) asking where all the food was because she was going to take food out to thaw and I told her I took it with me to my mother's because I needed to eat and since I bought the food, I wanted to be there when she makes it so I can eat it too, since it's mine. She kind of put on a guilt trip saying \"I really wish you would have said something to me about you taking all the food in the house so I could figure out what to feed my kid and husband while you're gone. Bummer. Guess our communication isn't as good as I thought it was.\" AITA?\n\nETA: I had over $300 worth of meat because she called in a meat package for $480 and had me go get it. She said she would pay me back or take it from my rent. She didn't pay me back, as she said she didn't have the money right now and she didn't take it from my rent either. I still paid her $750 for the month, because \"I can't cut back your rent this month because we are falling behind and need the money\". I never would have bought a \"Full Freezer\" meat package for myself.", "created_utc": 1688391029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pj3u3/aita_for_taking_the_food_i_bought_on_my_vacation/", "score": 233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or their scraps, as you say.", "NTA - She's taking advantage of your kindness. It's a lot cheaper to feed 1 person than it is to feed 4. I would look into storing what you can in your room or starting to make regular grocery store visits to pick up what you need for what you want to make at that time. And I definitely wouldn't pick up any more meat or food packages without her giving me the money upfront.", "NTA - they're taking advantage of you.  Please look for somewhere else to stay!", "NTA. You had a deal to pay rent and cook separately. She changed that deal without your input and just allows you to deduct what she thinks is necessary not the actual cost of the food. \nYou are not her personal shopper or her food bank.

In addition, they eat your snacks.\n\nOP, first and foremost I would suggest that you start buying food for one day at a time, cook it and then take out your portion and leave the rest. I know that this would be a nightmare for you because you would most likely have to shop every day but that\u2019s better than the hassle you are having now.

No, the communication between the two of you isn't very good because at no point when you were moving in were you told that you were expected to provide groceries for a family of 4. I would just directly address it with her instead of skirting round the issue. Tell her that you want to go back to buying groceries for yourself. Also, if you don't mind, you could offer to buy her groceries for her when you're at the shop if she gives you a list and the money up front. But only if you want to do that, you're not obliged.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d starve to death.

Buy enough for yourself for a couple days and then go back to the store when its gone", "Personally find a new place to live.", "NTA\n\nWhy isn't the husband buying and cooking food?", "Honestly, this is a tough one. It appears you did have some kind of a routine in place & it benefited both of you. If issues were getting \u201cbrushed under the rug\u201d then perhaps you should have addressed that with her directly.\n\nI think you did this in a very passive-aggressive way so don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s fall out from this but it is your food so.... \n\nNTA", "NTA but your avoidance of confrontation with her is making this worse. You don't have to angry-vent at her or anything, but if you're feeling the deal is not fair, it needs to be renegotiated.\n\nNow, though, you've got a whole additional issue which is she bought a meat package with your money that you then took away from her. You should have had a conversation over that - \"if you can't pay me back, and I can't reduce my rent, then the meat is now mine and I'm taking it away.\" That would have been a sensible position, not \"I've taken the meat because you didn't pay for it\" and is also bizarre if you don't actually want the meat, because now you're never going to get paid back for it. By running away to your mother's, you now have a more complicated discussion to have, unpicking the stuff you've just done.\n\nShe has clearly taken you for an easy supply of good food, but that doesn't mean you can't get along. You need to be ready to renegotiate when you go back, and decide what you want. Remember that your roommate is also putting in some effort in communal cooking, which may be little additional work for her because she's cooking anyway, but it's also not nothing. She sounds busy, hard working and under pressure so have some compassion. \n\nSo for example, you could have a communal shopping bill, so everybody pays equally for all the food - meaning you get 3/4 of every shop you make back, you pay them 25% of every food shop they make. You no longer have anything that is \"yours\" (although you could set up a \"black-bag\" system, where anything in the black bag is private, not included in the communal agreement and must not under any circumstances be stolen). Or you can get super detailed and record everything *you* buy that *they* eat, then get them to deduct it from rent at the end of every month.\n\nIt's a good conversation to have, and you have a better chance at getting on with your roommates in the future if you can actually have these types of conversations directly.", "NTA for wanting to take your own food but YTA for creating this situation/dynamic. It may not have been the deal you made when you moved in, but it's the deal you made through your complacency and lack of boundaries. If your new unspoken deal is that their family can eat your food, then that's the new deal and includes the -150 for rent.  \n\nThe truth is, you list all these reasons why they can't get food and then take the food away that they're use to using. Since you did not lay down any rules or tell them to stop, you are an asshole for this even though they also suck. \n\nAlso- why do you have $300 worth of meat? Why do you have $500 worth of groceries in your fridge just for yourself?", "Mostly NTA. But you should have spoken up before now. It sounds like there was some agreement (she takes it out of your rent) so she thought there was an understanding that they could eat your food. Obviously, that was not a fair situation, but you also could have communicated that 1. You weren\u2019t comfortable with that arrangement and 2. You would be taking almost all the food with you so the fridge wouldn\u2019t be empty when she got home. \n\nYour roommate and her husband are definitely more of the AH here, but have some responsibility to speak up.", "ESH. Not for the food- that is messed up and she is definitely taking advantage. You should 100% move out or renegotiate. But because you took it without talking. You\u2019re an adult. Use your words.", "ESH\n\nThem for assuming they can just eat any food in the house without paying you back, replacing what they ate, or ordering their own groceries. \n\nYou for allowing the slow, insidious, change regarding food to happen and not doing anything about it sooner. \n\nThe fastest way to resolve the issue is to stop buying in bulk.  Go to the grocery store every other day and only buy enough fresh food to feed yourself for 2 days.  Keep stored food in the house to a bare minimum.  It will force them to have to buy their own food.", "NTA. There are a lot of options for obtaining groceries these days. You can call in an order and pick it up on your way home, or you can have it delivered. There is no reason why she can\u2019t get her own food for her family. Since you took the food with you to your mothers house, I would at least cook it up, package it and put it in the freezer.  Make sure you label it with your name and date so whatever you take when you return to your roommates home is clearly labeled as yours. If I were you, I would pick up just enough food for yourself or get takeout each day. Ultimately, that will be less expensive than feeding her entire family. \n\nI think it\u2019s time to sit down and have an honest discussion with them because it sounds like they are not doing well financially but it\u2019s not your responsibility to feed her family. If they are unable to cover their monthly expenses, it\u2019s likely they will get evicted so you need to start looking for a new place to live.", "NTA. There are plenty of grocery delivery apps they can use if they don\u2019t have time to shop.", "NTA. If neither she nor her husband can get to the grocery store, they should be scheduling deliveries, not stealing your food. You need to find somewhere else to live.", "NTA. Text her back two words Grocery Store. Many grocery stores deliver or will shop for you and do curbside. Obvious question, where is her husband in all this? Why can't he shop?\n\nGoing forward you can buy and eat separately and get rent amount expected in writing. They should agree since you moving out will impact their finances. But moving out is something you might consider.\n\nEnjoy your time away.", "This sounds exhausting. Find a new place to live.", "NTA and time to find new accommodation. This is not sustainable and you\u2019re being taken advantage of.", "NTA. I wonder how your roommate fed her family before you moved in! She\u2019s charging you to stay in her home AND stealing your food. Move out. If she gives you a hard time, present her with a bill for the stolen groceries.", "Try to move out cause this is bsss", "NTA \n\nShe can order food for tonight. Be upfront and tell her you don\u2019t want to share food anymore because it\u2019s hard to keep track of your spending (polite excuse). Invest in a mini fridge and cabinet with lock for your own room.", "I agree with this. In this specific instance, outside of the rest of what\u2019s going on, the roommate is right that this could have been communicated a lot better. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t see anywhere that OP has tried to talk about this with her or actually work out a payment plan etc", "I have $300 worth of meat because she called in a meat package and asked me to go get it and said she would pay me back or take it from my rent. She never paid me back (ie: \"I don't have the money right now\") and didn't take it off my rent either. I still paid her $750 and they've just been eating all the food I bought.", "I genuinely don't understand this dynamic you have created with this family.

You aren\u2019t able to define and keep clear boundaries and this woman is taking shameless advantage.", "\"You're right. Our communication hasn't been great. You use the food I buy and it isn't fair to me that I'm subsidizing your family meals in addition to paying almost full rent, especially with inflation almost doubling food prices. Maybe when we get back we can work out a food budget for your family, and you can give me the money in advance to buy your groceries along with mine since you can't get to the store easily right now. That way you still have the convenience of not having to shop, and I don't feel like I'm being used. I'm glad we're having this conversation, hopefully things like this won't be an issue in the future. :]\"\n\nNTA, but if she wants to use the \"our communication was't as good as I thought\" guilt card, USE it against her.", "Ask her when she communicated the expectation that you as a tenant would provide food for the landlord and her family.

Text her \"Yes, your communication has been terrible.  I really wish you would have said something before you started using food I paid for without asking me in advance\".  You can use your absence to reset the relationship.  However she feeds her family while you're gone is the \"new normal\".  I hope you can stay strong and don't let her backslide when you return.", "NTA.  You'd have more privacy if you lived with your mom and paid her rent. At least buy yourself a door lock and a mini fridge and tell the landlord you'd like to go back to just being a boarder. Then just cook separately while the only other working person in the house is at work. Then start looking for a new place. Chances are they are not reporting the income you are paying them to rent a room. If you happen to be paying cash, all it takes is a threat to report to the IRS to make them suddenly willing to let you out of it. It's extremely unlikely that this unfortunate woman working full time with a husband that is 8 weeks out of surgery that can't cook or order online groceries but that can easily make it to the dinner table is reporting the extra income they are getting from you.   A google search might also get you more ammo to get out of a lease.", "NTA I doubt your roommate and her partner work 12 hours a day 7 days a week and it sounds like they eat more than $150 of your food", "NTA.
