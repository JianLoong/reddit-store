We could both do something bad and only I would get in trouble, they would often say I forced her to do it. My sister also got better gifts then me. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything over $20, while my sister could ask for something in the hundreds and they get it for her. Eventually my sister caught on and used it to her advantage. She would blame me for everything and our parents would believe her. If she wanted something of mine she would cry to our parents and they would force me to give it to her. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad because while I wasn\u2019t my parents favorite but I was my aunt\u2019s favorite. She couldn\u2019t have kids of her own so she treated me as her own. Unfortunately my aunt moved two hours away to work at a college and I didn\u2019t see her as much. \n\nWhen the time came I went to the college my aunt worked at, she let me move in with her and helped me out financially. My sister never went to college and job hopped. She never had to take work seriously because our parents took care of everything for her. When I left I went low contact with them because I had no reason for interacting with them, they weren\u2019t supporting me emotionally or financially so what was the point. \n\nNow I have my own apartment, good friends, a cat and a good job. I was happy with my life. Recently I got a call from my Dad. Apparently they are having a hard time. My sister can\u2019t keep a job, my dad is working less hours and my mother\u2019s new job pays significantly less so they can\u2019t support all three of them. He asked if my sister could stay with me to lighten the load on them. \n\nI said no, I am happy now and getting involved with y\u2019all will just make me miserable. You guys didn\u2019t do much for me when I was young so I don\u2019t owe them anything. My dad tried to plead with me saying they could loose the house and end up homeless. I still refused and hung up. Since then I\u2019ve been getting calls and text from them begging me for any kind of help. \n\nI do feel kinda bad because from their calls I can tell they are close to tears.

Fuck that.  \n\nTheir predicament, while unfortunate, was COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE.  Any idiot could have seen this coming from a mile away- spoil one kid rotten, never expect anything of them, and of course they turn out useless.  \n\nTime for sister to grow the fuck up.  \n\nAs for you- of course you don't want them to be homeless.

If it was just about money they'd ask for some money, or they'd force your sister to get a job to cover her share.\n\nBetween the three of them, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for them not to be able to keep a roof over their heads.

Now they are not enjoying the consequences of those choices.\n\nAlso, they didn't ask for money, they asked for your sister, the favorite who expects you to always receive the short end of the stick, to move in with you, i.e. you get to provide for the princess now.     \n\nThat sounds like intentionally signing yourself up to be tortured.", "NTA.

If worrying about them and their needs isn't going to help you then don't do it.

You are not obligated to support them (no one ever is).", "NTA\n\nBut I'm in a similar scenario and here's some truth: your sister is going to exist for most of the rest of your life.

You have zero obligation to help any of them.  Family isn\u2019t always the people we are born to or grow up with.\n\nMy suggestion is to tell them all that you will not help them.  It is not your fault they did not plan for this.  You do not owe them anything.  Wish them the best of luck.

Because her parents coddled her too much.

The guilt trip you feel is their goal, it's how they get what they want from you. I would listen to your aunt in this regard, she appears to have your best interests at heart.\n\nAlso from experience: letting them in now is going to fully drag you into their problems, no matter what you do or how hard you try to stay out. If you make the choice to let your sister come live with you, just take into account that you would again be subject to your parents believing her over you, picking her over you, and letting you pay financially for their treatment of you. You'll take atleast a decade to recover, AGAIN, and healing can only start untill some time after your sister leaves again. What if that's after 5 years? Are you willing to put up with this for years to decades more?", "NTA, your sister would just leech off you like she has off them.
