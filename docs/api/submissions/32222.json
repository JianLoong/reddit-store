I do not put a lot of stock into posts. Well, my husband\u2019s family seems to.

Anyway, I accidentally left a portrait photo of them out of the post. It was not intentional. The day after I posted I wake up to a text message basically explaining how deeply hurt they were that they were not included in the photos because I described them as my favorite photos of the day, and they assumed that that had meant I was being passive aggressive and not including them on purpose. This message included mentioning all the things they had done to contribute to the wedding and saying \u201cnow we know where we stand\u201d. They were upset because \u201cyou couldn\u2019t even tell\u201d they were there. Then there was a quote about how the abundance of the heart produces true thought. There was no communication about this issue. I was just told that somehow they were not important to me and all of their contributions were held over my head. I explained that it was really hurtful that they totally assigned intentions and attitudes to me with literally NO opportunity to communicate or explain myself. I\u2019m wary of being overly sensitive here, but it really felt like the message was intended to alienate and punish me emotionally for their hurt feelings instead of truly figure out what the issue was or solve the problem.
