For all intents and purposes Jared is an awesome guy to live with and I\u2019m super happy we\u2019re sharing a home.\n\nJared and I met at a company party about a year back. We work in different departments, and even more than this, we work from home four days a week, so we hadn\u2019t really had a chance to get to know each other until then. At the party I also became good friends with the women in his department and started to meet up with them for drinks every so often. \n\nWhen we started meeting, I noticed that sometimes, the women in his department would have complaints about Jared and his workload. He always got great performance reviews so I thought little of it, and they knew we were together so they were always gentle, but they put it as him routinely missing deadlines or speeding through work and making small mistakes here and there that one of them would later have to fix. \n\nI always sided with Jared until we moved in together. Then I learned they were completely right. Basically, he\u2019ll work for a couple of hours in the morning, and then load up his favorite game (Path of Exile) for a \u201cbreak\u201d while he has work on his second monitor. Between in-game activities he\u2019ll take a look or make a couple of changes, but then jump right back into the game. \n\nAt first I tried to tell him we were on company time and shouldn\u2019t burden people in our department. He said that if I had time to supervise him then we were no different. Over time I noticed that he probably spends 3-4 hours a day truly working, 4-5 hours a day focusing more on his game.\n\nYesterday I finally blew a gasket when I realized how much the women in his department had put up with. I called his supervisor and gave a full accounting of how Jared split his time working from home. The supervisor immediately called Jared to chew him out, threatening to take away his WFH privileges. Jared apologized and said that I was exaggerating his time spent in-game, but I had already told the supervisor that he would try to sell this story.\n\nNow Jared is furious at me. Yesterday evening he installed a lock on his workroom door so I couldn\u2019t check in on him anymore. I still hear clicking and keyboard sounds that are distinct to his video game.\n\nDid I go too far here?", "created_utc": 1694663263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16i7x2m/aita_for_reporting_my_boyfriend_for_his/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you have a concern, you talk to him not his boss. It is so weird for someone to go tattle to their significant other\u2019s boss.", "YTA and I would kick you out.  You have demonstrated more loyalty to the people in his department than your actual bf.  Why dont you go move in with one or more of the woman you ratted out your bf to if you want to do them favors?\n\nYour bf's workload is between him and his own boss and the great performance reviews are his feedback.  He already has 1 supervisor, he probably doesnt need a second one.  Nobody likes a rat so keep your mouth shut about things that dnt concern you.  YTA", "ESH\n\nJared should be using his work time for work, what he's doing is illegal in some places, and he does definitely need to pull his head in.\n\nOn the other hand, you, as his partner and someone who also would be affected if he lost his job, should be more concerned with your partner than the women he works with, if his work was not bad enough to be pulled up by his bosses, that means he was doing well enough and the other women could have spoken up to their bosses if it was such a big issue for them.\n\nIt sounds like you were jealous he was getting away with it and decided to try put an end to it, and you weren't even smart about how you went about it to avoid any sort of fall out. \n\nYou've likely caused a big issue in your relationship because of this and nothing else. Sounds like he's not changing, his bosses didn't care enough to fire him, and all that's happened is now your partner who you just moved in with doesn't trust you anymore.\n\nGood work, and good luck.", "YTA- Moving in to become a corporate snitch. At least have the decency to break up and move out first.", "YTA- also, why would you date someone if you have less loyalty to them than THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR?? That\u2019s so crazy to me.", "YTA\n\nFor the most part, he accomplishes the work with minor errors. That would be generally acceptable even in the office. Errors are why companies have overlapping skills on teams. Unless he is being paid by the hour or doesn't do the work, it doesn't matter how long he takes to accomplish the job or how he uses his time.\n\nYou literally threatened his ability to maintain his own shelter and food. Your primary concern was for his female co-workers correcting \"small mistakes\" in their colleague's work. *That is absolutely monstrous!* \n\nIt is brutally clear that you do not love, respect, or even care a little bit about this guy. I hope he has enough self respect to end this relationship with you. Any trust he had in you is gone. Without trust, the relationship is dead.\n\nThis is an excellent example of why no one should ever date a coworker. Letting people we work with into our personal life makes them a potential threat to our source of income.", "ESH, and I doubt you\u2019ll be together much longer after this. People try to find ways to work less and make the same money. If he wants to stay with you he will have to give that up, and there could still always be a trust issue since you are willing to go to his boss if you think he isn\u2019t working hard enough. Sometimes my gf and I both call in sick so we can spend a nice day together. That\u2019s something you can never do with your bf, because according to you it would be wrong. Basically you picked your new friends at work over your bf. Can\u2019t really go back on that.", "YTA. He's working to his supervisor's satisfaction. If his coworkers feel like they're taking up his slack, then they need to talk to his supervisor, not his girlfriend. The fact that you tried to warn them that \"he would try to sell this story\" and you're now taking it upon yourself to \"check in\" on him tells me you've got your nose so far up the company's ass that you can smell its tonsils. You're being a wonderful employee and a really shitty partner. If that's the choice you want to make, don't be surprised when he kicks you out.", "YTA.\n\nYOU are in a relationship with the guy and YOU betrayed his trust and sold him out to his supervisor, choosing your friends over your partner.\nHow is he supposed to ever trust you again? I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nNo idea how this relationship will move forward. Best of luck to you.", "YtA. \n\nI would kick you out.", "So you put his job in jeopardy and thought that was ok? It\u2019s his supervisor job to monitor him and correct his behavior and give him feedback. You need to stay out of his job.

You aren't his supervisor.", "Info:  Would you have cared as much if the people impacted were men, and weren\u2019t your friends?", "I mean clearly you aren\u2019t that invested in the relationship if you\u2019re willing to sell him out to your company.\n\nYTA and likely to be single too.\n\nHe\u2019s also 100% right that you have obviously been wasting company time tracking his time.", "YTA. I was originally going to say E S H but this made you go from \u201csneaky brown noser\u201d to \u201czero loyalty/actively trying to screw your boyfriend over\u201d:\n\n>I had already told the supervisor that he would try to sell this story\n\nOn top of that: \n\n>I couldn\u2019t check in on him anymore\n\nSorry, are you his boss? Mother? No? Then why are you so focused on spying on him and grassing him up? It almost comes across like you\u2019re jealous or bitter about how little he does during the day and wanted to make sure he\u2019s working as much as you. You\u2019re not in the same department, so not only is it not your place but it\u2019s weird that you\u2019ve chosen to prioritize loyalty to work acquaintances over your boyfriend. \n\nAlso, I hate to break it to you but your righteous anger really wasn\u2019t very well thought out. Your boyfriend got away with a warning but he easily could\u2019ve been terminated and is likely at a greater risk of being let go if the company needs to make cuts in the future. Would that be the consequence of his own actions? Sure, but it would also mean that you would be living with an unemployed partner and picking up the bills until he found a new job. Tbh, I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019d stay in a relationship with someone as quick as you to throw me under the bus. Are you sure the clicking you\u2019re hearing now isn\u2019t him searching for a new apartment?", "YTA.  Yea, you went too far.  What goes on at home, stays at home.  Other redditors have said the same thing that I'm about to say.  You should have discussed this with him first.  Not with a threat, but with a reality check of what others are saying about his lack of work ethic. You're not his boss.  You're not his supervisor.  By doing so, you've created a barrier between the two of you now.  From now on, you can be assured that he won't talk to you about work anymore. Let him be at fault for his own mistakes and shortcomings.  You worry about you.  \n\nGood luck.", "YTA. What the fuck? You will be lucky if he doesn\u2019t leave you over this.", "ESH - I would have ended the relationship if my SO pulled that. Now, to be fair, he's definitely not doing the right thing but that's for you to decide if you want to be in a relationship with someone who thinks that's ok. I don't think you had a right to call his manager. Even if you didn't work at the same company, you'd know he was playing games at home and calling it work. Would you have googled his boss' name and called that person on him?\n\nEdit to go from YTA to ESH - I'm tired and forgot that was a choice. Sorry!", "YTA, what he does during his work time is not ur problem. If his work is good enough for his bosses and that fine.\n\nI would def break up with u if it was me", "YTA his work ethic is not yours to try and fix, if work hasn\u2019t caught on and let him do it that\u2019s on them. Also doesn\u2019t help you that the vast majority of companies use and abuse their employees, I say good on him for taking them like this. Not to mention it\u2019s total betrayal I don\u2019t see this lasting long to be honest no trust to be had anymore.", "YTA. What the fuck, OP, even if you think what he does is not okay it doesn't give you the right to be a snitch to his boss. It's repulsive how you chose work over your SO. you must be that kind of people that still think the company they work for actually cares about them. Guess what? They don't", "YTA. You should maybe get to the bottom of why you felt the need to try to sabotage your own boyfriend's job and whether or not you actually like the guy or not.", "YTA- He should breakup with you. You took work to the bedroom. You invaded a coworkers at home office and reported him. If you werent living together it wouldnt be your business. \n\nThat being said, if his works sucks its not for the women in his department to complain to you, they should complain to his boss and fire him if the work isn\u2019t acceptable.", "ESH\n\nWould you have called his boss if you didn't work at the same company? If you think he's being a dirtbag, then you have a conversation with him and leave if he doesn't shape up, or just leave in the first place. You don't go over your SO's head to get them in trouble at work", "YTA. You are sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong and using your relationship as a weapon.", "YTA - what kind of person does this to this significant other? Especially to support the grumbling other women at work? I'm not saying what he's doing is right, he should be working, but for your to report him to his manager? Christ. \n\nAnd what if he'd got fired, where's the money to pay for that place you just moved in with him coming from then? Seriously what was your actual goal with any of this?\n\nI hope he breaks up with you immediately. This is a massive breach of trust and as everyone else says how is he supposed to trust you ever again? He can't risk telling you a secret in case you go and blab it to that person or anyone else. You've proven yourself completely untrustworthy.", "YTA jesus christ this is some advanced-level snitching. you had nothing to gain from doing this and hopefully he will break up with you over it!", "YTA\n\nIt's simply an invasion of his privacy. You took a privilege that you have as his partner, and then used the knowledge gained from that and acted as a colleague.  \nAt most, you have the right to discuss the issue with him outside of work time if it is making you feel uncomfortable.", "YTA!  WTH? Are you trying to get your live-in BF fired?  He should be better about being focused on work during work hours, but you -- well, you ratted out your own live-in boyfriend?   What if he had gotten fired?   Could you guys pay the bills on just your salary?  Were you going to throw him out too after getting him fired?   I'd break up with you over something like that.  Wow.", "YTA\n\nHe sucks for having other people pick up the slack but it\u2019s none of your fucking business. \n\nYou suck way more than he does. Who narcs on their partner like that? Stop getting on some moral high horse when you are spending company time nagging him and monitoring what he does when that\u2019s not your job description. \n\nI would dump your ass if I were him. That\u2019s a level of breaking trust that\u2019s not forgivable. You could\u2019ve gotten him fired. He clearly gets good performance reviews and hasn\u2019t gotten fired thus far so it\u2019s not a problem. \n\nYou sound like a jealous, bitter person. Like you\u2019re upset you can\u2019t get away with working less hours. Or you\u2019re just a self righteous narc who has no loyalty", "YTA and I think both your jobs are going to be in trouble if you think calling and tattling on your boyfriend makes you look professional. I wouldn't want to touch that with a 10-ft pole if I was your Boss. How is the boss supposed to discipline him for this? Like a write up where it says per your girlfriend you are slacking off on work from home?? How does this not end up in a crazy he said she said situation?", ">He always got great performance reviews\n\nIf he can play games and still be able to get great performance reviews that means he does his job well enough to justify his pay.\n\nYou have no right to rat out how he manages his time on the job at his home.\n\nThe supervisor dosen't have any right to know what jared has been doing at his home. If he was causing problems he would've been called out way before.\n\nYou are a terrible partner.\n\nYou went and ratted out your SO to his manager because he dosen't follow the same work style you do, and now are pikachu suprised face when he dosen't want to talk to you anymore ?.\n\nYeah YTA", "ESH\n\nPossibly your BF *doesn\u2019t* suck though and here\u2019s why: \n\nYou\u2019re saying that his performance reviews are great and the women that work with him are saying his work isn\u2019t up to par or late. Those two things don\u2019t align whatsoever so one of them isn\u2019t accurate. Is it possibly a situation where your BF\u2019s work simply isn\u2019t done *their* way? We\u2019ve all had coworkers who have their own particular standards regardless of what the company standard is.\n\nYou aren\u2019t your BF\u2019s supervisor nor are you your friends\u2019 supervisor. The moment they started talking about the quality of his work with you, it was your responsibility to respond with, \u201cI\u2019m not the person to whom his work is held accountable.

He may be fulfilling his responsibilities to the job\u2019s satisfaction. You haven\u2019t shown how you know he\u2019s not utilizing his time properly; only that he has a lot of downtime. If you\u2019re trying to monitor something you haven\u2019t had to do yourself I\u2019m finding it hard to believe that you\u2019re able to accurately judge his productivity. He has a point as well, did you really bring more value to the company by babysitting him for a while rather than doing your own work?\n\nYour coworkers played you. They know you aren\u2019t the proper person to discuss your BF\u2019s work ethic with but they chose to anyway.

He needs to kick you out and you need to be single.", "YTA. Wow why does he not kick you out? You violated the boundaries of being his partner big time and prioritized your co-workers. You cannot possibly expect this relationship to survive.", "ESH obviously he shouldn't be slacking off and burdening his coworkers, but you aren't his supervisor and if you are acting like it after two weeks of living together this relationship is doomed to sink.", "Holy smokes!!! Uhhh how can you still be on a relationship? You ratted him out and that should come with moving out. This post sickens me on many levels.", "How did you think snitching on your live in boyfriend who is also your coworker was going to go?\n\nAnd nice try making it about women's rights or what the fuck ever.", "YTA", "YTA for not being able to distinguish between personal and work life.

I'm sorry, but who's side are you on here? You'll get your \"awesome\" boyfriend fired to score goodness points with your company which gives 0 fucks about you in general. \n\nIt's not your job to decide if he does a passable job tbh and if you want a future with this person, you're not helping your case by betraying him like that.\n\nIf my wife kills someone, I'm grabbing a shovel, not calling the police, but that's just me I guess.", "Massive YTA.

Why not talk to him more about this. Relationship torpedoed. Sounds like his performance wasn't bad enough to get him fired, but you had to come riding in on your high horse.

He was getting great performance reviews but his coworkers had complaints. You technically had NO idea how his performance is besides what his performance review reported- which was GREAT. You aren't his coworkers' mom. If they have issues with how he does his work, they are fully capable of speaking to his boss. If his boss cared, then they would monitor his performance- either the coworkers were just being bitchy and had no real complaints but played you, OR they were too scared to bring it up, OR his boss was monitoring his work and was happy with it. This isn't the girl power or righteous moment you thought it may be- it reads as a rat sucking up to a company, that doesn't care one bit about you, in case you forgot.\n\nYou don't rat out the person you are dating, love, live with, and are probably planning a life with. You can express disappointment and urge him to change his ways or even break up with him if you are so disgusted, but how did you think this would turn out for you? Also, most importantly, WHO do YOU think you are?\n\nFor the record- I would hate working with him but I would hate working with a snitch like you more. I've also dated people who cruised through life with minimal effort but excellent reviews/success- they've mastered \"work smarter not harder\".

That's the clicking on the keyboard.", "YTA. Oh my word, you actually have more loyalty to your company than to your partner. That's insane! He could have lost his job because of what you did. Is he wrong to play games half the day? Sure. Is it your place as his partner to spy on his work activities in his (and your) own home? Keep work and personal life separate or I can almost guarantee you won't be living together long. What he did is bad (to his employer, not to you), but what you did is far worse.", "YTA.\n\n> I noticed that sometimes, the women in his department would have complaints about Jared and his workload.\n\nAnd for some reason, you automatically assumed that these complaints were justified by reality.\n\n>  He always got great performance reviews so I thought little of it, \n\nSo the women are already proven to be objectively wrong.\n\n\n> but they put it as him routinely missing deadlines \n\nWhich would absolutely be reflected in his performance reviews if true, but gosh, they aren't, are they?\n\n> or speeding through work and making small mistakes here and there that one of them would later have to fix.\n\nIn other words, doing an excellent job.  Speedy work with occasional small mistakes?  That's the fucking dream.\n\n> Over time I noticed that he probably spends 3-4 hours a day truly working\n\nWhich is way more than most people do.  It's clearly more than you do, if you have time to be obsessively documenting his activities.\n\nHell, two hours a day of actual productive work out of somebody actually in an office is rare. \n\nSo you should really be asking yourself why a) you're prioritizing your female friends over your partner, and b) why you're making the classic middle-manager mistake of thinking that 'actual output' is a useless metric, but 'looks busy' is the gold standard.\n\nGo read Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber and maybe open your eyes to the modern reality of work.", "YTA and will be buried alone, good job!", "You ratted on your BF to his boss about his work habits.

To be clear I've worked jobs where you can play games in between your work. So if he was able to game and still complete his work I wouldn't think twice about it. That's not the case here so you were right to report him.  In fact I'd report it sounds like he's still gaming but has locked his door to prevent visual confirmation.  However I'd do this after moving out.  I'd also give serious consideration to whether there's a future with him.  His lack of integrity is a serious concern here.

For all intents and purposes Jared is an awesome guy to live with and I\u2019m super happy we\u2019re sharing a home.\n\nJared and I met at a company party about a year back. We work in different departments, and even more than this, we work from home four days a week, so we hadn\u2019t really had a chance to get to know each other until then. At the party I also became good friends with the women in his department and started to meet up with them for drinks every so often. \n\nWhen we started meeting, I noticed that sometimes, the women in his department would have complaints about Jared and his workload. He always got great performance reviews so I thought little of it, and they knew we were together so they were always gentle, but they put it as him routinely missing deadlines or speeding through work and making small mistakes here and there that one of them would later have to fix. \n\nI always sided with Jared until we moved in together. Then I learned they were completely right. Basically, he\u2019ll work for a couple of hours in the morning, and then load up his favorite game (Path of Exile) for a \u201cbreak\u201d while he has work on his second monitor. Between in-game activities he\u2019ll take a look or make a couple of changes, but then jump right back into the game. \n\nAt first I tried to tell him we were on company time and shouldn\u2019t burden people in our department. He said that if I had time to supervise him then we were no different. Over time I noticed that he probably spends 3-4 hours a day truly working, 4-5 hours a day focusing more on his game.\n\nYesterday I finally blew a gasket when I realized how much the women in his department had put up with. I called his supervisor and gave a full accounting of how Jared split his time working from home. The supervisor immediately called Jared to chew him out, threatening to take away his WFH privileges. Jared apologized and said that I was exaggerating his time spent in-game, but I had already told the supervisor that he would try to sell this story.\n\nNow Jared is furious at me. Yesterday evening he installed a lock on his workroom door so I couldn\u2019t check in on him anymore. I still hear clicking and keyboard sounds that are distinct to his video game.\n\nDid I go too far here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That way, you\u2019ve given him the opportunity to do the right thing. \n\nNarking on him is not really showing loyalty.\n\nLocks on doors? Yikes", "YTA - that\u2019s what lots of people do, front load in the AM and then relax the rest of the day.  \n\nOnly difference is that since he is home he can play a game instead of staring into space if he was at the office", "ESH. So I think that you hugely overstepped by telling on your partner. Did you even consider whether or not you could get your partner fired? What would you have done if he lost his job? Were you prepared to financially support both of you? I really feel like this is an issue you could have worked on at home without bringing it to work. \n\nThat being said, your partner should be held accountable for his work habits, just not by you personally. I think too many people in the comments are letting his conduct slide as if it's perfectly acceptable to work a four hour day but collect a check for eight or nine hours. It's pretty standard for people not to give 100% every single day they work, but deliberately playing a game for four or five hours during your shift is definitely a bit over the top. I also think it's pretty significant that it was impacting his other coworkers. \n\nJared is the sort of person that gives WFH employees a bad rap.

I think people in the comments downplayed this, but personally if my partner did what Jared did I'd be pretty put out about the situation too.", "YTA, WFH doesn't change the amount of games some will play. I shared an office right before covid with a guy that played games in office during the day. I was hired on because his workload was too heavy and I was new.

I was a loyal hard worker that became jaded over about 2 decades of different jobs with the same stories... coworkers taking naps in closets, hiding in parking lots... \n\nWho cares what your coworkers do as long as they aren't hurting you.

How are you more loyal to your company than your boyfriend I will never understand. Most people only work for 3-4 hours even inside the office anyways.

HOWEVER, I disagree with everyone saying that you should\u2019ve just ignored his behavior because it doesn\u2019t affect you, or because his supervisors still gave him good reviews. Your boyfriend was not just being lazy, his behavior shows he doesn\u2019t take responsibility for his work or have integrity. He is using paid time to play games, not just when he finishes tasks or as a small break, but for hours. I wouldn\u2019t be surprise if he is addicted given the amount of time he spends, which \nis not healthy for him either. Everyone saying that you\u2019re so evil for jeopardizing his job is conveniently ignoring the fact that his job is only jeopardized because his behavior is actually worthy of being fired, and that\u2019s on him. So you\u2019re not wrong for wanting to do address his behavior, but I don\u2019t think reporting to the supervisor was the way to do it.", "Ur boyfriend deserves better", "You\u2019re an asshole!
