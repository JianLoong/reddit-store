At this point, I\u2019m leaning to Y T A. Telling someone the STFU is rude in almost every circumstance. It\u2019s your father\u2019s house. It\u2019s your fathers partner. Telling him not to bring her over again is way out of line. You\u2019re 19. If you have an issue with who your dad brings home, get your own place.", "YTA. I\u2019m assuming this is your dads house and you live there? Then yeah, you have no right to tell him who he can and can\u2019t have over.

If she's staying in the house, there might be times where she needs to chastise, but that should be confined to something involving her. She shouldn't be getting involved in an argument between your Dad and your little brother. It's up to your father to chastise his son in an argument involving him. Likewise, you shouldn't have got involved either.\n\nHow old is your brother? If she's telling him not to talk to your Dad this way, he can't be a little child. Why would he be having a shower with your Dad? Unless he's really young, he should be showering alone. If he's older, I can understand why he doesn't want to shower with your Dad. He has a right to his own boundaries and expecting an older child to shower with his father is very intrusive, at minimum.", "INFO\n\nI don't get the T A comments. Living with him doesn't mean that he can abuse you. Defending yourself and your sibling from abuse is never wrong.\n\nTo clarify, did your Dad repeatedly move a GF in without thinking about the reality of the situation and just give her equal power and/or expect you to do as she says?", "YTA\n\nYou sound incredibly rude. \n\nYour dad's girlfriend of 4 years has every right to be there when she's invited by your father. Let me remind you that it's your father's place. \n\nYou're 19. If you don't like it, move out, get your own place and you can refuse to invite Kerry to it.\n\nYou also have a bizarre definition of bullying if you think that telling a screaming 8 year old to not raise his voice to his dad / her boyfriend is \"bullying.\" It's not.\n\nAlso, it's weird that your father takes joint showers with his 8 year old son. That's the kind of thing that I'd want child services to investigate because it's definitely not normal.\n\nGrow up. You're not a minor anymore. Your father has no legal obligation to house you or feed you anymore. If you're going to stay at his place, grow up. Growing up means using the manners you were supposedly taught and knowing how to interact with other people including your father's girlfriend of 4 years.\n\nDon't like it?\n\nThen that's where getting your own place comes back in. You can act as rude and as juvenile as you want in your own place as long as you pay the rent, don't violate the lease or break the law.", "Question is your brother by chance on the spectrum?

NTA.\n\nAlmost everyone sucks, because you are of course basically an adult belting out orders in your dads home, **however** his girlfriend sounds just...outright awful.

That way atleast she can have a say.", "Your solution doesn't work for this situation. \n\nIf we look at the bare facts, the GF has created issues before. GF moved out because she caused issues. GF moved back in without the Father having a discussion about the key and life altering issues that OP said were going on. A discussion would've been mentioned if there was one.\n\nSadly, it's not abnormal for a single parent to move in a partner without actually thinking about the reality of it. So, with the specific part I mentioned, OPs Dad is in the wrong.\n\nOP raised her voice to defend her younger 8 year old sibling. The conversation was between her and her father. As they've written it, the GF was interrupting. The GF, as OP said, has been known to lie and cause issues.\n\nIn this specific situation, OP either defended their sibling or they didn't. Should they have not defended their sibling? Would you have shut up if your single parents barley moved in problem GF interjected In a conversation between you and your parent when you were protecting your sibling?\n\nSay OP does as you say and just moves out. That leaves the very young sibling victim to whatever the problematic GF may do. If OPs writing is to be believed, behaving means just shutting up and letting themselves be abused. Not to mention, they need a job and $$$ to leave the situation.\n\nWith these in mind, your solution is never happening. Nothing will change.\n\nIt'd be more effective to say that OP should try to really discuss with their father or clarify their situation in the comments. Any father who moves in an abusive GF and gives them full control is an abusive one. If it can be fixed, then OP should move out.", "OP also called her a \"bitch.\" That's asshole language. The whole situation sounds really toxic.\n\nAnd his dad can't bring his gf over?

They most likely live together (I\u2019m not rereading to see lol). They may have decided that they are in a committed long term relationship with all the outward benefits of a marriage without getting married.

Your brother is too old now for that. If he was a much younger child, I'd understand, but he's well able to shower himself at eight. Maybe you could speak to your brother alone, and ask him how he feels about this arrangement, and see what he says to you.\n\nI do think his girlfriend should have stayed out of the conversation with your little brother. Let your father handle it. It's between him and his son. I do think you escalated the situation by saying that you're right here if she wants to make you shut up. If you have words with her in the future, you need to remain calm. You don't want any escalation. The fact she specifically said that she's not scared of you makes me think that she might be. You have to remember that you're physically bigger than her and the average man can overpower the vast majority of women. It's a concern that's always in the back of women's minds. I'm not saying that you would ever do this, but if you're getting angry, making threats, and calling her a 'b*tch', it could cause her to worry for her physical safety.\n\nAlso, you giving your father ultimatums is not going to bode well. As much as you don't like her, it's your father's house, he can choose who he has in it. What if he kicks you out? What about your little brother? You need to be calm and keep a rational head.", "It is not normal for an adult to shower with an 8yo.

He\u2019s her partner and they\u2019ve been together for 4 years and she\u2019s known your brother since he was a toddler. That gives her some degree of authority. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s his mother, but she at least has as much input that a nanny or a teacher would have after this many years.", "That is an incredibly immature response.", "[removed]", "Yeah, that's talk to a mandated reporter level concerning.", "Op said the child was tired and didn\u2019t want to take a shower period. It had nothing to do with dad. And no\u20268 is still an age where if the child is ok with it\u2026it\u2019s not out of the ordinary. Now if dad were forcing the child to take a shower with him and the child wasn\u2019t comfortable with that situation that would be a different story. But that\u2019s not the case here.

It's a parent's job to instill boundaries. This is how a child learns about boundaries. Children who don't grow up with boundaries struggle to establish them throughout their entire adulthood. It's not an eight year old's job to have the wherewithal to know that they need to assert boundaries and tell their father not to shower with them anymore. How would you even expect a child that age to have the language to accurately articulate this? It's parents' job to teach them what boundaries are and the importance of them. Also, some children have never showered with their parents, at any age. Their parents would obviously bathe them when they're too young to do it themselves, but don't actually shower with them.\n\nJust because the child gave the reason that he was tired does not mean that this was the reason. I'm not saying that anything untoward is going on here, but you're being wilfully ignorant to assume that children will disclose the real reason that they don't want to shower. Abused children, for example, are often too afraid to, or ashamed to (even though it's not their shame to carry but they feel it is) because their abusers threaten them with harm if they tell anybody, or they tell them that it's \"their little secret\".\n\nThere's probably nothing untoward going on here, but it is still inappropriate to shower with a child that age. Children that age are becoming aware of their bodies, other people's bodies, becoming aware of what sex is, what genitalia are used for etc. They're also developing the concepts of autonomy, personal space and privacy. It's simply inappropriate at that age. An eight year old is well able to shower alone.", "I\u2019m not reading all of that bc you are assuming they are in the same culture as you. It is extremely common for European countries to continue showering together for longer ages than in America. This is an American thing.", "No, it's not. An 8yo without disabilities or developmental delays that are still bathed by a (naked?) adult would at least cause raised eyebrows and quite likely a report to child services too.", "You are assuming this is your country and your culture."]}
