{"id": 31502, "submission_id": "1819agz", "title": "AITA for arguing with my GF because she cooked me a dish I dislike?", "selftext": "I (21F) have always been something of a picky eater. I grew out of it somewhat and can tolerate eating most things now except one, bell peppers. I physically cannot smell or taste them without feeling almost physically sick. My gf knows about this as well. She really likes cooking and so she does most of it, while I take on other chores instead. \n\nRecently she made me a sort of pasta dish with bell peppers in it, which I refused to eat (usually I\u2019d just pick them out but they were chopped really finely). She got a little mad at me for that since she\u2019d made the pasta by hand and was excited to share it with me. I did apologise and said I loved her cooking, but I simply can\u2019t stomach bell peppers. Every time I\u2019ve forced them down I feel ill afterwards and sometimes I can\u2019t even taste them without gagging. She seemed okay with that and said she\u2019d forgotten about my dislike of them, and said she\u2019d remake it for me. \n\nA few days ago she made the pasta again, this time without bell peppers or so she said. I was a little suspicious of it just from the smell, and asked her about it but she insisted there were none. When I actually ate it, I was sure there were some bell peppers in it and asked her again, and she said no again. I was still cautious but chalked it up to me imagining things and managed to eat it. Once I\u2019d finished she asked me how it was, and I said good (even though I didn\u2019t like it, but didn\u2019t want to be mean). Then she said she\u2019d actually pur\u00e9ed the peppers and put them into the sauce, and she seemed really smug about tricking me. \n\nBy this time, I was a little upset that she\u2019d lied to me repeatedly about the dish. Yes, I managed to eat them since the texture was gone but I still dislike the taste and wouldn\u2019t have eaten it if I hadn\u2019t felt guilty about before. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to eat it again. So I admit I snapped at her a bit and told her it was wrong for her to try and trick me into eating the one thing I can\u2019t stand just because she was offended that I didn\u2019t eat  her cooking the first time. She called me an AH because she\u2019d put so much effort into making the pasta again and I wasn\u2019t appreciating it.\n\n I appreciate that she cooks for me, but there are a thousand other dishes she could have made. Now we\u2019re both giving each other the silent treatment.

Tricking someone into eating something they don\u2019t like is just bad behavior.\n\nMy husband didn\u2019t like some foods I consider absolute staples when we met - seafood and mushrooms.  So I asked him if he\u2019d be willing to try things I made that I thought were good introductions to those foods, with the understanding that it would be totally okay if he didn\u2019t like them and there would be no hard feelings if he wanted to eat something else.  The first seafood I fed him was king crab, because it\u2019s not fishy at all and it\u2019s one of the most delicious kinds of seafood.  He liked it enough to start trying other seafood, though he would ask me what it was like first and generally doesn\u2019t enjoy the fishier fishes (like salmon or swordfish).  I made a mushroom dish where the mushrooms were finely diced and mixed with other things we knew he did like (feta and spinach and potatoes), and then tried things where the mushrooms were more obvious; now I think he likes them just as much as I do, though neither of us likes raw mushrooms.\n\nIf you want to try to convince an adult that they might like something, you do it with their knowledge and consent, and you go in knowing there\u2019s a chance that they may never like some things no matter how they\u2019re prepared, which means you don\u2019t get mad at them when that happens.", "This is seriously messed up and I consider tricking people into eating a food they don\u2019t like to *prove something* a vile personality trait!\n\nHow are you supposed to trust this person now? \n\nNTA", "NTA. There are plenty of foods I don\u2019t like too and my partner knows this and takes it into consideration. I\u2019m not a child so he doesn\u2019t trick me or force me to eat it. If she\u2019ll trick you over something so stupid like bell peppers, what else will she trick you over in the future? She should have just dropped it.", "NTA - The lying, boundary-pushing, and sneakily trying to prove a point about the food are major red flags. I'd be mad too if my trust was stomped all over like that.", "NTA. The fact that the smell alone makes you gag means your body doesn\u2019t do well with bell peppers. Your gf is the TA for assuming otherwise, tricking you, and then acting smug and now stonewalling you. There is a name for this: Crazy Making.", "NTA\nWe ALL have that 1 thing we strongly dislike or prefer to avoid. This is far from being a picky eater.\nShe knew it and just did it to prove something where there was nothing to prove. She should have respected your dislike and cook around it or simply let you prepare your own meal that night.", "Wow.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf she's \"putting in all this effort\" and then deliberately adding food that makes you ill to prove a point, she's not putting in the effort for you. It doesn't sound like she likes or respects you *at all.* Instead of playing this game, maybe she should spend some time looking up food intolerances, food aversions and how to deal with them.\n\nI'm intolerant of tomato. I can eat very small quantities and not notice. If I eat pizza, I'll have a stomach ache and the runs the next day. If I eat tomato soup, I'll be vomiting every hour for a day. I'm upset, I like tomato. I've spent ages developing recipes to replace things I love that normally come with tomato, like baked beans, lasagne, ketchup.\n\nAnd yet, there's some people out there who will make out like I'm being a toddler refusing food.\n\nYou're a grown adult. You have one food boundary. If she's going to sneak bell peppers into all your food, you maybe can't eat anything she cooks again.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has a vegetable or certain food that you can't like no matter why. It's wrong of her to be so insistent that you eat a dish with *the one thing* you don't like. For example, I can't tolerate ricotta cheese and I have tried it many times. Maybe I would understand if you never tried bell peppers and she was trying to get you to try them. But she didn't have to lie and treat you like a child.", "NTA I also hate bell peppers. I can't even pick them out because the flavour permeates and overpowers the dish. I would flip if someone tricked me just to try and prove a point and would be suspicious of anything they gave me in the future.\n\nYour no is a no, not a challenge. If she's willing to bulldoze such a small boundry, where does the line end? If she waves off your concerns and doesn't see an issue with her behavior, you will need to consider whether a relationship with this person can continue.", "NTA you don't trick people into eating things they hate that's just awful", "NTA. You don't fuck around with peoples dishes", "NTA. I don't love picky eating as such but I abhor people who lie about food contents. Trust violation red flag fuck them.", "I absolute detest mushrooms and my GF knows this. If she purified them into a dish and was smug about it afterwards, she wouldn\u2019t be my girlfriend anymore.\n\nNTA and get out of the relationship", "NTA - I'm kinda concerned about some of these comments. It's ok to not like certain foods? Especially if you are neuro-spicy. Anyway.

Wtf is her point, what\u2019s she trying to prove? Time for a break away from her so you can think about what\u2019s good for YOU.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t be messing with your food like that. She knows your feelings, and lied about it. Not okay.", "NTA. At this point I wouldn't eat food she offers me since now in her mind she's \"gotten away with it\" She'll try to do so with anything else you don't like. Also, that's no way to live, but you kept asking so clearly you knew what she was doing and she repeatedly lied to you because she thought she was right.", "NTA. Smuggling things into someone's food is wrong, period. My GF doesn't like the taste of raw onions, so I don't put them into dishes I make that she'll be eating (or I fry them really well).", "That's disgusting she should be ashamed of herself. Why would you try to deceive someone in to eating something they clearly don't like or can't have is beyond me. Millions of recipes out there so why she hell bent on making you eat one you don't like?? NTA however she absolutely is the AH", "NTA. It\u2019s bizarre she would spend time making a dish she knows you won\u2019t eat and, if you do, the likely outcome won\u2019t be pleasant.", "She put in sooo much effort to TRICK you. It\u2019s honestly scary. She\u2019s a major AH.", "NTA, I am the same way about green beans. I do not like the taste, nor the smell. Why must people insist we will like something if they just do something different. She is the ass for pushing and pushing than getting her nose out of joint because she lied on top of pushing her food on you.", "NTA. Tricking someone into eating something is not okay. But, does she really like bell peppers or something? Because if she's the one always cooking, not being able to cook with an ingredient she likes ever might seem unfair to her, and cooking 2 seperate meals to accommodate both of you probably also seems unfair to her.\n\nGoing behind someone's back to trick them is not okay. Lying to them is not okay. Your gf is very much the AH here, so I'm very clear.", "NTA\n\nMy mum did this to me when I was a kid. She even told her friends how she tricked me while she was laughing. 20 years later, it's still a sore spot for me.", "NTA. I find bell peppers absolutely disgusting too. Dick move of hers.", "NTA. your gf really went as far as tricking you into eating it and gloating about it afterwards when she could've easily made it without the bell peppers. and all of this, seemingly, for your validation. seems a little stupid on her behalf, if not outrageous.", "Although you are not allergic to the peppers, you do have an intolerance to them. (You feel sick after eating them). And she deliberately tricked you into eating them. She's evil.  I wouldn't trust her anymore.", "NTA and WTH is with all these people tricking their loved ones into eating things?? This is like the third story of this same situation just this week. Stop messing with people's food!", "NTA - I'm a bit like you. Also hate peppers. Some people just don't get it and they think \"If I cook them this way he'll love them because how could he not?\".\n\nI also don't really like the term \"picky eater\". I like what I like and I don't like what I don't like. \"Picky\" implies I have a choice in the matter. I don't. Just because my list of foods that I don't like is longer than the average person's it doesn't invalidate the fact that I don't fucking like onions. You can't really sneak them by me.", "This was how the downfall of humanity started, apple or pepper, still the same story.   \nNTA", "NTA.  I have very little patience for picky eaters, and my response to this post was going to be \u201cThen make your own fucking dinner\u201d until she revealed that she had intentionally tricked you into eating the peppers.  That is just shady as fuck, and wildly disrespectful.\n\nI was always raised to believe that you don\u2019t have to eat something you don\u2019t want, but this is what\u2019s for dinner so if you don\u2019t want to eat it you can either go hungry or find your own food.  My mom made one dinner for the house every night, and if I didn\u2019t like it I was free to make myself ramen or something, but she wasn\u2019t making anyone their own separate meal.\n\nIt\u2019s fair for your girlfriend to sometimes want to try making things that you might not like.  And it\u2019s fair for you to choose not to eat what she makes if you don\u2019t like it, as long as you\u2019re not expecting her to make you a second dinner.\n\nBut when she\u2019s trying to trick you into eating shit you hate, that speaks to a serious lack of respect in the relationship, which would be very troubling for me.", "NTA - that is such odd behavior on behalf of your gf. You tell her you don\u2019t like something sk she goes out of her way to trick you into eating it, then tries to guilt you into feeling bad because she took the time to make something you have told her repeatedly you do not like? Very manipulative.", "This is.... Weird. What is your girlfriend's obsession with Forcing you to eat literally the one thing you can't stand and that makes you ill? I understand the appeal of taking on a challenge on your girlfriend's side, but not for this, not for something you've explicitly said you do not like and that makes you sick.. And definitely not without saying something to you about it, like just say \"hey, I really like peppers, and I wish I could cook more dishes with them. Would you be up for tasting a few dishes with peppers that I think you might enjoy? No pressure if not.\" it's very inconsiderate to go behind your back and lie like this.", "NTA I hate raw tomatoes and I would be super pissed off if someone sneaked them into my food and then looked smug\n\nI do like bell peppers though. I'll have yours if you're not eating them.", "NTA - get a new gf. i am the same about bell peppers, if you don\u2019t like a food you don\u2019t like it. Can she not make a pasta dish without peppers? Would she continue to add peppers if you were allergic?\n\nRED FLAG CITY", "NTA.... that's pretty toxic. You dislike what you dislike and  I would expect my partner to never cook something with an ingredient that repulsed me just as I would never do the same to them. I'm sorry she did that to you OP.", "Someone did this to me once.  It was a mean thing to do and I learned then it was about control and hatefulness. If someone cares about you, then they listen to you and leave out the offending food item. I think from your physical reaction to bell peppers you might have an allergic reaction to them, it\u2019s not merely a simple thing. Be careful with this woman, she obviously is more controlling than you know.", "NTA. Personally, I would break up over this. She knows you have an aversion, and she actively and intentionally lied to and manipulated you and circumvented your consent. She's shown you that she's willing to do these things, she's not trustworthy, and she doesn't respect you. Hard pass.", "What if your dislike was actually an allergy and it made you really sick?

She thinks how hard she works on something is more important than very clear boundaries you set, because let's be clear: \"I do not want to eat X thing\" is a boundary.

I'd give some thought to whether or not she respects the boundaries of people, not just you.", "That was soo weird of her like bell peppers are ONE ingredient and like ?? such an uncommon one for pasta??", "NTA. I agree with you that bell peppers are awful, and your GF is the AH for trying to trick you.", "NTA\n\nBut I think it's a lesson learned that being polite isn't always the best thing to do - you saying it was good can easily make her pull that absolute bs off again, and one time is already one too many.

I grew out of it somewhat and can tolerate eating most things now except one, bell peppers. I physically cannot smell or taste them without feeling almost physically sick. My gf knows about this as well. She really likes cooking and so she does most of it, while I take on other chores instead. \n\nRecently she made me a sort of pasta dish with bell peppers in it, which I refused to eat (usually I\u2019d just pick them out but they were chopped really finely). She got a little mad at me for that since she\u2019d made the pasta by hand and was excited to share it with me. I did apologise and said I loved her cooking, but I simply can\u2019t stomach bell peppers. Every time I\u2019ve forced them down I feel ill afterwards and sometimes I can\u2019t even taste them without gagging. She seemed okay with that and said she\u2019d forgotten about my dislike of them, and said she\u2019d remake it for me. \n\nA few days ago she made the pasta again, this time without bell peppers or so she said. I was a little suspicious of it just from the smell, and asked her about it but she insisted there were none. When I actually ate it, I was sure there were some bell peppers in it and asked her again, and she said no again. I was still cautious but chalked it up to me imagining things and managed to eat it.

Yes, I managed to eat them since the texture was gone but I still dislike the taste and wouldn\u2019t have eaten it if I hadn\u2019t felt guilty about before.

It comes down to principle, it was a dishonest and intentional interaction on her part. While I understand how she might desire that you be willing to eat other foods more or be more open-minded, the way she dealt with it is like how you deal with a picky child. On top of that, it sounds like she is defensively deflecting when you point out what was wrong with this whole thing, and making it about appreciation for her cooking when it\u2019s not.
