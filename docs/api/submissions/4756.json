Try to see it that way and not worry to much about their behavior.  Take this time for Beth.\n\nI'm going to switch gears here a little since it sounds like it is very important to both Beth and you that her wishes are followed. If she really wants this, she needs to name a Power of Attorney for Healthcare (this is not the same as a regular POA) many hospitals, and perhaps even her hospice nurses can assist with this. This ccx way she can choose a person who will carry out her wishes after she passes (which sounds like you). With your mom alive, and no spouse or children(?)  your mother will be considered her legal next of kin and can do what she wants regardless of what your sister has expressed as her wishes. POAHC is not the same as financial POA...basically just legally names the person to carry out health care decisions and funeral decisions. Your mother (assuming there's no children) would still be next of kin in financial matters, unless she's named someone else for that as well.\n\nI work in the funeral industry, as this is something not everyone knows or thinks about. If the family is already fighting about this, and Beth is in decent enough health to consider this, it may be a way she can control what happens when she passes.\n\nAgain, it is admirable you stood up for your sister's wishes. Lot of love to you and your sister.", "NTA", "nta 100%", "NTA. Good for you, OP! Your sister is lucky to have you", "NTA. If they were just asking, they would have stopped at the first no.

Going against your own daughter's dying wishes and then clutching pearls after getting a blowback. Quite the piece of work, she is.", "NTA. But have your sister talk to a lawyer about her burial plans. This somewhat happened to my S/O's mother. When his dad died years ago, his mom went all out to plan for the future. She bought 6 plots together (her husband, herself, her 2 children and their spouses), a headstone for her husband and then a joint headstone for her and her husband after her death. When she died, his sister took over and buried their mother an hour north of where she wanted to be buried. The headstone is still sitting at the cemetery unused. It's been over 10 years and my S/O is still bitter over it.", "NTA. I lost my dad last year to cancer. We listened to everything he wanted and didn\u2019t make HIS death about US. Unfortunately when people get sick or die people\u2019s true colors are shown. The selfish people make it about them and cause unnecessary drama. Be there for your sister and don\u2019t let anyone steamroll her on what she wants. The last thing she needs right now is a bunch of people trying to pressure her about how she wants to be handled after passing.", "NTA. You are trying to respect your sisters wishes.

Beth divorced him for a reason.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and frankly, your mother committed an unforgiveable sin in my eyes, your sister's dying wishes for her burial I'm guessing cost your mother NOTHING.

You're completely right, your mom needs to be advocating for her daughter, not her ex-husband. Beth has her wishes and is clear. Thank you for contributing to advocate for her.\n\nETA: are you executor of her will? Sure needs to make sure whoever is will honour her wishes.", "NTA . What they were doing was bullshit; manipulative and cruel/unfair.", "NTA!", "NTA", "Why do these things always end in drama and gossip with people who have no business knowing any of it. Obviously you\u2019re NTA and Matt sucks. They\u2019re divorced! He needs to back off.

They may try to go against her wishes.", "I can't decide between E/S/H and N/A/H. \n\nShould you have gone off at your mom during a holiday dinner? No, and there are nicer ways of getting the point across (or you could've just said this is not a discussion I want to have during Thanksgiving)\n\nYour mom for trying to go against your sister's wishes, but this is her *daughter.* She's probably trying to cope with the grief. Your family is close to Matt and it sounds like your mom almost sees him as a son, so I can understand why they think it's disrespectful she wants to be buried next to her first husband (it's almost invalidating her relationship with Matt, even if they are divorced they were a couple at one point).  But yes it's Beth's wish and your mom should understand that.", "Nta. But I can totally tell you're the lil sis.\n\nAs a big sis, I, too, would've seen through this BS & wouldn't want to be bothered.  But as mom & Matt are annoying AF, i would've told Beth \"mom & Matt don't want your buried (where you want to be), but instead want you buried (wherever they want), so i hope you don't make them the executor of your estate, or give them POA. As your sis, I love you & will support you in whatever decision you make.\"\n\nHonestly, idk why people can't let others die in peace.

Because I\u2019m not certain I would trust your mother to honor Beth\u2019s wishes.\n\nI don't know the term for it, but I believe there is some paperwork Beth can fill out regarding her final arrangements that (in most states, assuming OP is in the US) the family is obligated to follow. Or perhaps Beth can establish OP as the person designated to make that decision, POA or something.

Ffs. NTA.", "They were trying to manipulate you into talking to your dying sister about something she's already decided upon. You're definitely not the asshole. They were being rude, inconsiderate bullies. What the fuck does husband number two have at stake here? Why does he get to say anything at all? You absolutely did the right thing in shutting them down clearly and forcefully. If you hadn't they'd still be working you over to get things their way.

He was taken from her. He never broke her heart.\n\nMatt on the other had is an ex, a mutual parting, Beth chose to cut that connection. In some way Matt did break her heart.

I pray she doesn\u2019t suffer.", "Exact. Matt is the example of a freaky, obsessive ex. They divorced a long time ago, why should Beth change her plans for Matt.

The family only has a few months left with their daughter and this is how they choose to spend the time.", "Op did tell his mom that he not going to talk to Beth about it and to respect her wishes. So snapping at his mom and matt after they pushed the conversation to continue was fair.", "1) She set a boundary saying she wouldn\u2019t go against her sisters wishes. That should\u2019ve been the end of the conversation. The mom and ex brother in law kept pushing so yes she is allowed to be snappy. \n2) Her first husband was ripped away from her against her will (car crash). She CHOSE to divorce Matt. Why in the world should she have to spend the rest of eternity buried next to a man she divorced? She didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of her life with him, so why would she want to be buried next to him for all of eternity? \n3) Her divorce with Matt invalidated the whole being buried next to each other thing because they are no longer a couple. Who cares what he wants, he\u2019s not the one dying young!", "How is it op fault? Op literally told his mom and matt that he not going to talk to Beth about and to respect her wishes. Its on op mom and matt for pushing the topic.", "Yep...Matt's just mad because he wants to be able to put on a show of being a devoted widower or something and Beth being buried far away and next to a man she actually loved would kill that vibe for him.", "Who\u2019s job is it to make sure that she actually gets buried where she wants?", "Is Matt the father of her daughter or her first husband? Tbh he still doesn\u2019t get a say in where she wants to be buried. It\u2019s just the only reason I can imagine he would think he has any say. \n\nOr mom wants her buried close and he was the only one willing to agree with her.", "So Matt and your sister have a child together? Then he's still a part of the family (niece's father) whether you like it or not. Also probably the reason why he thinks she's being disrespectful, but he and your mom both need to respect Beth's plans and back off so I definitely agree with you on that. But you could've been more civil during a family holiday dinner.", "No my niece's dad is Beth's first husband", "They don't. OP says in a comment above that his niece is Beth's first husband's child.", "Yeah, then he\u2019s an ah for thinking he has any say. Might be the latter though. I can understand your mom wanting her close, but she needs to respect her wishes. You did good. Good luck OP. I lost my brother and it hit me harder than I expected. You are right. Feels like something will always be broken. Missing piece of my heart. I don\u2019t even know where his ashes are (drug addiction issues) and it hurts not having a specific place of memorial for him. Keep standing up for your sister. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
