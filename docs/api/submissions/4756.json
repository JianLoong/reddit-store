Try to see it that way and not worry to much about their behavior.  Take this time for Beth.\n\nI'm going to switch gears here a little since it sounds like it is very important to both Beth and you that her wishes are followed. If she really wants this, she needs to name a Power of Attorney for Healthcare (this is not the same as a regular POA) many hospitals, and perhaps even her hospice nurses can assist with this. This ccx way she can choose a person who will carry out her wishes after she passes (which sounds like you). With your mom alive, and no spouse or children(?)  your mother will be considered her legal next of kin and can do what she wants regardless of what your sister has expressed as her wishes. POAHC is not the same as financial POA...basically just legally names the person to carry out health care decisions and funeral decisions. Your mother (assuming there's no children) would still be next of kin in financial matters, unless she's named someone else for that as well.\n\nI work in the funeral industry, as this is something not everyone knows or thinks about. If the family is already fighting about this, and Beth is in decent enough health to consider this, it may be a way she can control what happens when she passes.\n\nAgain, it is admirable you stood up for your sister's wishes.

But have your sister talk to a lawyer about her burial plans. This somewhat happened to my S/O's mother. When his dad died years ago, his mom went all out to plan for the future. She bought 6 plots together (her husband, herself, her 2 children and their spouses), a headstone for her husband and then a joint headstone for her and her husband after her death. When she died, his sister took over and buried their mother an hour north of where she wanted to be buried. The headstone is still sitting at the cemetery unused. It's been over 10 years and my S/O is still bitter over it.", "NTA. I lost my dad last year to cancer. We listened to everything he wanted and didn\u2019t make HIS death about US.

They are responsible for ensuring that the estate\u2019s creditors (first) and beneficiaries (second) are paid, that other terms of the will are met, including handling of the remains, and that the estate is ultimately dissolved. Challenges to the will, the execution of the estate, and the handling of the estate are heard in probate court. Probate court is notoriously slow and hard to navigate, and it\u2019s best to avoid going to probate if at all possible. \n\nFor anyone wondering, some of the steps you can do this are:\n-\tHave a will. Many employers offer legal benefits and this is a great use of them. Lower cost legal services are often available through universities. You can also download a template for a will and write it yourself. Any protection is better than none!\n-\tName an executor you trust and tell them that you\u2019re naming them. Make sure they always have an up-to-date copy of your will. \n-\tMake arrangements for what you want to have happen to your body.
