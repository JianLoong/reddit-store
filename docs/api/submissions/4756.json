Try to see it that way and not worry to much about their behavior.  Take this time for Beth.\n\nI'm going to switch gears here a little since it sounds like it is very important to both Beth and you that her wishes are followed. If she really wants this, she needs to name a Power of Attorney for Healthcare (this is not the same as a regular POA) many hospitals, and perhaps even her hospice nurses can assist with this. This ccx way she can choose a person who will carry out her wishes after she passes (which sounds like you). With your mom alive, and no spouse or children(?)  your mother will be considered her legal next of kin and can do what she wants regardless of what your sister has expressed as her wishes. POAHC is not the same as financial POA...basically just legally names the person to carry out health care decisions and funeral decisions. Your mother (assuming there's no children) would still be next of kin in financial matters, unless she's named someone else for that as well.\n\nI work in the funeral industry, as this is something not everyone knows or thinks about. If the family is already fighting about this, and Beth is in decent enough health to consider this, it may be a way she can control what happens when she passes.\n\nAgain, it is admirable you stood up for your sister's wishes. Lot of love to you and your sister.", "NTA", "nta 100%", "NTA. Good for you, OP! Your sister is lucky to have you", "NTA. If they were just asking, they would have stopped at the first no. They pushed it, and you rightfully pushed right back.", "NTA, Matt can fuck off. Beth gets the final say on where she wants to be buried and if nobody else likes it they can fuck off too.", "NTA. Going against your own daughter's dying wishes and then clutching pearls after getting a blowback. Quite the piece of work, she is.", "NTA. But have your sister talk to a lawyer about her burial plans. This somewhat happened to my S/O's mother. When his dad died years ago, his mom went all out to plan for the future. She bought 6 plots together (her husband, herself, her 2 children and their spouses), a headstone for her husband and then a joint headstone for her and her husband after her death. When she died, his sister took over and buried their mother an hour north of where she wanted to be buried. The headstone is still sitting at the cemetery unused. It's been over 10 years and my S/O is still bitter over it.", "NTA. I lost my dad last year to cancer. We listened to everything he wanted and didn\u2019t make HIS death about US. Unfortunately when people get sick or die people\u2019s true colors are shown. The selfish people make it about them and cause unnecessary drama. Be there for your sister and don\u2019t let anyone steamroll her on what she wants. The last thing she needs right now is a bunch of people trying to pressure her about how she wants to be handled after passing.", "NTA. You are trying to respect your sisters wishes. That\u2019s what matters right now.", "NTA. And I hope that your sister legal protections in place ensuring that her wishes are followed. Because I\u2019m not certain I would trust your mother to honor Beth\u2019s wishes.\n\nAnd why in the world would Matt think that an EX husband is entitled to ANY input at all as to where your sister is buried?", "Matt & Beth are divorced.  There is no relationship to disrespect so Matt can fuck right off.  Your sister has stated her wishes, end of discussion.  If Thanksgiving was ruined, it was by Matt and your mother.  NTA", "Do they understand Matt is an ex?? An ex. Beth divorced him for a reason.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and frankly, your mother committed an unforgiveable sin in my eyes, your sister's dying wishes for her burial I'm guessing cost your mother NOTHING.  Yet she puts an EX before her dying daughter.  Sorry, I wouldn't forgive that.", "NTA - I think they opened that can of worms by discussing it at thanksgiving.

Your sister and her first husband were separated by death, not falling out of love. She is not married to Matt, and even if she was, her wishes for where HER body should be laid to rest should be respected if possible.", "NTA, good for you for standing up for your sister and her wishes. It's her decision in the end, and if she wants to be buried next to her late husband, that's what's going to happen. Matt is an ex-husband who should have no input, and frankly, I'd be concerned if his intentions are a bit more malicious than they seem.", "NTA the women is dying it's her choice to choose where to be buried when  she dies that's it", "NTA", "NTA  \nShe can \"disrespect\" her marriage when she's already divorced him? HAHA no. She wants to be buried to the love of her life, who she lost very early on, and it's her damn death she's expressing her opinions about. I hope OP's mom doesn't butt in to change things.", "NTA. Matt is her ex husband by *divorce*. He doesn't get a day where she's buried, and it's none of his damn business. You're completely right, your mom needs to be advocating for her daughter, not her ex-husband. Beth has her wishes and is clear. Thank you for contributing to advocate for her.\n\nETA: are you executor of her will? Sure needs to make sure whoever is will honour her wishes.", "NTA . What they were doing was bullshit; manipulative and cruel/unfair.", "NTA!", "NTA", "Why do these things always end in drama and gossip with people who have no business knowing any of it. Obviously you\u2019re NTA and Matt sucks. They\u2019re divorced! He needs to back off. Your mother is probably thinking that she wants to be able to visit Beth and siding with Matt to get that, but that\u2019s just unfortunate. Beth made her choice and everyone needs to respect it and shut up.", "NTA,\n\nDoes your sister have a will and an executor of will.  They may try to go against her wishes.", "I can't decide between E/S/H and N/A/H. \n\nShould you have gone off at your mom during a holiday dinner? No, and there are nicer ways of getting the point across (or you could've just said this is not a discussion I want to have during Thanksgiving)\n\nYour mom for trying to go against your sister's wishes, but this is her *daughter.* She's probably trying to cope with the grief. Your family is close to Matt and it sounds like your mom almost sees him as a son, so I can understand why they think it's disrespectful she wants to be buried next to her first husband (it's almost invalidating her relationship with Matt, even if they are divorced they were a couple at one point).  But yes it's Beth's wish and your mom should understand that.", "Nta. But I can totally tell you're the lil sis.\n\nAs a big sis, I, too, would've seen through this BS & wouldn't want to be bothered.  But as mom & Matt are annoying AF, i would've told Beth \"mom & Matt don't want your buried (where you want to be), but instead want you buried (wherever they want), so i hope you don't make them the executor of your estate, or give them POA. As your sis, I love you & will support you in whatever decision you make.\"\n\nHonestly, idk why people can't let others die in peace. A dieing person does not want to be harassed about where they're buried!", "NTA. I applaud you for doing that. They have no say in any of this at all. What they should be doing is respecting your sister's wishes and not make this about them at all.", "NTA. I wish your sister and your family peace in these final days. You are wonderful for fighting for her wishes.", "NTA.\n\nGet your sister a lawyer. Make sure yourself or someone who will live up to her wishes are the executor. \n\nShe has every right to be buried where she wants. \n\nI'm sorry you're losing your sister, OP. I can't imagine how painful it must be.", "NTA \n\nShe only divorced one husband so why would that be the one she's buried next to", "ESH (besides sister)\n\nHolidays aren't the time for squabbles like this. Why can't people get along for a single fucking day? I would have told them we needed to have this discussion later as a family and leave it at that.", "NTA. The best thing you can do is what you did: vigorously advocate for your sister\u2019s wishes to be respected.", "Thanks for the info, Beth does have an executor and will, not me but my other sister. (and she has a daughter but she's 17, so still a minor)", "What really sends my head spinning is the part that it is disrespectful towards the ex-husband for her to be buried alongside her late husband. Just what?", "That is absolutely NUTS!!! What was her reasoning??", "> NTA. And I hope that your sister legal protections in place ensuring that her wishes are followed. Because I\u2019m not certain I would trust your mother to honor Beth\u2019s wishes.\n\nI don't know the term for it, but I believe there is some paperwork Beth can fill out regarding her final arrangements that (in most states, assuming OP is in the US) the family is obligated to follow. Or perhaps Beth can establish OP as the person designated to make that decision, POA or something. As it stands, unless Beth has children, their parent(s) would be considered next of kin and hold the right to decide.", "This is what I was thinking. She *lost* her first husband. She got rid of Matt. How can they not see where her heart would lie?\nEdit: NTA", "This. It was them. They're just upset you didn't react the way they wanted", "I'm actually the lil bro, but same thing. I agree, the last thing any dying person needs is to be harassed about what others want. Beth has endured a lot in her life, she always came out strong but it was no sunshine and rainbows. Now she has terminal cancer as the icing on top of the shit cake, and the only thing I want is for her wishes to be honored.", "Because shitty family members USE THE FUCKING DAY to bring this shit up, so they can hide behind *you're ruining the day* if they get called on it.\n\nIt's manipulative af.", "Ok...just checking bc most people don't realize a will/executor deals only with financials and is not the same as Healthcare POA. It's an entirely separate document and many families are sideswiped by this when trying to make funeral arrangements.", "I know!! Why on earth would Beth want to be near an ex (in person or perpetuity \u2014 that bit is unclear)??", "My BIL and I hate each other's guts and we manage to get along for a couple of days when they drive up to see us every Holiday."]}
