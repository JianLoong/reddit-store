She snooped & was selling the table as a 'brag'(?) moment...WTH; she literally wanted you to know she knew. She is a self-centered, entitled person who cannot allow someone to gift her a gift. There are tools to manage anxiety but this does not excuse her from treating people with respect and kindness. She went from 0 to 100 telling you to leave.", "NTA.

She doesn't deserve the \"something small\" except for maybe the empty space now left by her own decisions. \n\nI agree with there people here too saying that this snooping and anxiety almost certainly does not stop with gift giving.

That look\nof astonished joy is so heartwarming.  \nNTA.  Your girlfriend is rude, and I suffer from extreme anxiety, so I call BS on her excuses for her obnoxious behavior.  I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything. I wouldn\u2019t reward dishonesty and sneaking around.

Especially after you specifically told her not to and that it robbed you of the joy of surprising her.

What's not ok is for her to access your personal email/phone/whatever without your consent. \n\nIf she's going to blame her anxiety then she needs to seek treatment.

That's just not appropriate at all.", "NTA, the fact she couldn't even WAIT is ridiculous. She doesn't have to check, she chose to.

I have an anxiety disorder and I\u2019m calling BS, this is taking advantage over her mental health. \nSeriously, she is freaking out over this? \nIMO it was a bit uncalled for cancelling her Christmas present, that being said even though she is your GF she isn\u2019t entitled to a gift from you. \nI get it we all want material things including myself but throwing a tantrum. \nAlso, lmao she kicked you out of your house. \nLet her cool down and talk it over with her.

Anxiety or not this is not ok.  NTA", "NTA you set a boundary and she ignored it. It's sad that she chose to bite herself in the ass but having anxiety doesn't force you to snoop that was her choice", "NTA\n\nAs someone who can't handle the suspense, I always ask my husband if I can guess what he got me. (I usually get it on the first guess or the second even if it's something totally random) It's kind of become a game, and he gets excited think \"I've got her this year!\" And I'm still always super excited and thankful when I open it up. \n\nBUT.....\n\nI would never snoop and try to find out what the gift is. That's just massive boundary issues....if you warned her (and even if you didn't!) totally okay to have returned it. Especially if you had wanted it to be a surprise. But I'd be worried what other snooping she does, and also, what level of snooping did she do to find out what you got her? Was it a quick browser history on a shared computer? (that's on you for not clearing history then) or did she dive into emails or bank records texts and the like?", "I'm going to take you at your word in your post, and not assume other things (red flag of potential behaviors, etc). You said this is the one thing that bothers you and it's limited to solely her desire to snoop about gifts. \n\nIt's annoying beyond belief when a person spends a lot of time planning a gift, and then the recipient \"cheats\" and finds out what that gift is ahead of time. I've had my share of dealing with GFs and my wife doing the same.   \nHowever, and this is unpopular, but again, I'm taking your comment and not extrapolating further out than what details you provided --> I think returning the gift was not the right move. I would give a YTA, but softly. \n\nWhen giving a gift that has a lot of thought and meaning (such as this make up desk/vanity mirror), the joy is not only in the few minutes after they are surprised and open the gift. I've done the same with my wife, and I felt the joy and excitement for months afterwards as she used her vanity mirror or enjoyed other gifts I gave her. Yes, it would have been frustrating if she had learned of it beforehand. But her learning of the gift earlier would not have taken away the effort I put into the gift, the thoughtfulness I tried to convey with it, and seeing her enjoy it afterwards for a long time. \n\nInstead of the knee-jerk reaction of canceling the gift, having a dialogue about what it means to  you when she snoops and discovers your gifts, and seeing if she understands what her actions do to those around her around the holidays --> this would have been a better method. She acted childish with her snooping; using a childish reaction to her snooping doesn't make it better. \n\nI hope you two can still have a good holiday despite this set back.", "NTA but-and this is probably going to be unpopular-why does the surprise matter so much? She has demonstrated many times that she doesn\u2019t like the surprise part of gift giving and that kinda ruins her experience and giving gifts is still fun even if there is no surprise aspect. She was TA, but you will be TA if you keep buying her gifts and expecting different results.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just to see how she would react.", "NTA her excuse it's my anxiety is pure BS. She nosy and has zero respect for boundaries. She tried to kick you out of your own house is she crazy?", "She's full of excuses. If she had anxiety about what gift she's getting, she would have brought it up beforehand. She just doesn't want any consequences for acting so childishly.\n\nShe was incredibly disrespectful of the effort you went into picking out a gift for her, and of your agreement that she not spoil it.\n\n>This year I made her promise not to go snooping for her gift or else I would get her something small. She promised and I went all out. \n\nWords mean things.\n\nYou laid out terms. She agreed. She broke terms, you followed through. Get her something small.\n\nNTA", "NTA but break up with her. She IS snooping on your private conversations, emails etc. She is not doing that just because of gifts. She is jealous and controlling.", "NTA, but she definitely is a brat", "NTA, and that comes from a reformed anxiety induced snooper. If her anxiety is so bad she has to go through your emails and snoop, she can be a big girl and go to therapy like the rest of us.", "NTA. And I\u2019m calling bullshit on the \u201cneeding to know what gift she\u2019s getting due to anxiety.\u201d I have an anxiety disorder diagnosed from a doctor, gift receiving anxiety is not a thing.", "This has a lot of marinara.  Jars and jars. \n\nOp - NTA\n\nGF - oh boy.  Big time AH.\n\nI saw a comment about changing passwords and  locking down your personal private info.  DO THIS.  And look at having her move out of your house.", "NTA \n\nI am the person that hates surprises due to childhood trauma. I also communicated that to my partner so I don\u2019t snoop. He runs gift ideas by me and I find this more comforting and assuring than just surprising me with something. \n\nThe point is if it\u2019s her anxiety they need a compromise. If she is just a snoop she sucks.", "NTA she ACTUALLY FUCKED AROUND AND FOUND OUT", "NTA. OP, she tried to kick you out of your house?? Over her having a tantrum? If I were you, I\u2019d be reevaluating the entire relationship.", "NTA.  NOPE.  She\u2019s an adult.  Who lists an item for sale before she even gets the gift?  Not someone with anxiety.  Calling bullshit on it.  Go get her some socks and wish her a merry Christmas.", "You're NTA, but question: Does she also skip to the end of books, the ends of movies, look up spoilers online for tv shows? There are people who just really don't like the surprise and want to know these things, and that can include what they're getting as a gift. If the above is the case, time to have a sit down chat to get to the root of her behavior.", "ESH y\u2019all need to communicate. But is she going through your emails and whatnot to find this out?", "NTA but she probably knows about this post bc she has access to your email.", "Nope.  You set boundaries and she stomped on them\u2026.and she has no right to tell u to get out of yourmown house.  Probably time to reconsider the relationship.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnxiety is not an excuse to be a sneaky a/hole. She\u2019s invading your privacy and trying to justify it. \n\nThe she gets mad when she\u2019s caught and screams at you???? \n\nDude/ RUN!!!!!!!", "NTA and her trying to kick you out of your own house might be the real marinara flag here", "NTA. Most people grow out of that phase by age 9. A few hold out till their teens. And the rest end up in justnomil reddits later in life.", "NTA\n\nNot only should she not snoop, but she also lied when she promised she wouldn\u2019t.", "NTA but if you know you gf is a huge snoop be more creative with hiding your gifts. Wrap a gift a few joke gifts; glitter bomb, fake dog poo\u2026. (I don\u2019t know) and beat her at her own game. Some people just can\u2019t handle surprises.", "You have a reasonable request, to respect your privacy and her future gift, she did not honor that and then name called you in retaliation. That\u2019s not very mature or healthy on her part and you are NTA.", "NTA- if her anxiety was really the reason for this then it should have come up during the discussion where she ended up promising not to snoop.  She is just using it as an excuse after she got caught breaking her promise.", "NTA.  What else is she snooping around for that you don't know about?  My boyfriend and I each declared one area for Christmas gifts.  From November 1st on, that space was off limits to the other person.  For example, if his jacket was in the entry way coat closet, and I'd declared that my space, he had to ask me to get his jacket for him.  I needed a screwdriver out of the toolbox in the garage?  If that was his declared area and it was after November 1st, I'd have to ask him (or someone else) to get it.  We respected each other's boundaries and always had wonderful surprises on Christmas.  Besides, small gifts aren't necessarily bad.  He loved getting letters from me when we lived five hours apart.  One year, he bought me a stationary set.  Another year, he bought me a first edition book that I wouldn't have bought myself because I would have felt guilty about spending that much on myself.  Then there was the year he bought me 12 pairs of work gloves.  His reasoning was simple.  I'm a writer, but I liked helping him build fences, tear down old barns, etc.  He didn't want my hands to get hurt/messed up and he knew I could be absent minded, so 12 pairs of work gloves should last me the 12 months of the year.  He passed away in 2019.  I still miss him.", "I mean, my mom is kinda like that, but only in the sense that she\u2019ll try and get it out of me, or if there\u2019s a gift under the tree before Xmas, she\u2019ll carefully unwrap it and then wrap it again. It\u2019s funny, and mitigated by the fact that I now keep her gifts at my house until the day of. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s a game. We are both willing players. And no one is snooping in anyone\u2019s private, password protected, info. \n\nOP, change your passwords on EVERYTHING. I don\u2019t like jumping straight to \u201cbreak up,\u201d but if she throws a fit over you changing passwords, you need to take a good hard look at that.", "NTA\n\nHuge red flags. I'm guessing that for her to have known about the gift she must have gotten access to your phone or laptop. Not cool to be going through someone's email or browsing history. This isn't anxiety, this is a complete lack of respect for boundaries and privacy. Why would you want to be with someone who acts like this and blames it on anxiety like that's some type of excuse?", "NTA, but if you think your spouse hasn\u2019t run a background check on you your wrong\u2026", "NTA This issue is a lot deeper than Christmas gifts.", "NTA curiosity killed the cat. Now she doesn\u2019t get her nice table.", "NTA how entitled omg", "NTA. You had asked her not to snoop, and she did it anyway. She broke a promise and repeated her behavior. She is now angry that she has to suffer the consequences for her actions.\n\nYou guys have been together for 3 years, and at this point she should know that you aren't going to get her anything harmful- she should trust you at this point, regardless as to if she has anxiety. Hell, I'm anxious about surprises too- but I always trust that my partner knows me well and has my best interest in mind!\n\nThat fact that she has such an issue with snooping is cause for concern in of itself. That shows a lack of respect to you that I suspect isn't just surface level, or solely gift-related. She could easily be snooping into other things or monitoring other stuff of yours. Again, 3 happy years together should warrant trust- and snooping is a sign of a lack of that! As well as some honesty - she blatantly broke a promise she made to you, which isn't okay at all.", "Wanna bet she is snooping reading this thread right now?\nNta", "NTA... she broke her promise.  I'd get her a gift card if she cant play nice.", "As someone with anxiety, I do everything in my power to avoid being surprised with gifts. Every gift giving holiday is a nightmare. I am sick to my stomach all December long every year.\n\nI'm not sure if she's in the same boat as me, but I get it. You know she does this, is it really that important that she be totally shocked with every gift? Is her being not just excited and thankful, but sincerely flabbergasted really the only reason you get her a gift?\n\nNAH, but y'all need to get on the same page. She doesn't want to be surprised, and if all you want is to surprise her, you need to figure out a way that is mutually enjoyable, because clearly this is making you unhappy, and the surprises are make her unhappy.", "NTA. i'm also an anxiety-ridden person and don't much care for surprises either, so we have this very simple system where people just flat out tell me what they're getting me. that said, some people insist on surprising me anyway, but i don't mind this too much since it's mostly only my parents who do this + i know how big of a deal it is to them. i never expect to get anything, so i think they deserve their serotonin hit for getting me something. it's only a couple times a year, anyway.", "NTA.\n\nOP, the key is to never leave a digital trace. Never. Not even a paper trail or a crumb of evidence.\n\nPS - she did this to herself.", "NTA, you sure you want to be with someone like this? It\u2019s only going to get worse.", "NTA", "I have seen worse but YTA.  Life is hard enough  and if you find someone who is amazing in every other way than gift receiving than you are very very lucky.  Get her the original gift and stop trying to punish people you love.", "Neither of you is listening to each other\u2019s boundaries and needs very well. I might also gently suggest she see a therapist about her anxiety if it\u2019s crossing your boundaries and impacting the relationship. NAMI has a friends and family course if you want to learn more about anxiety.", "NTA. I have pretty bad anxiety so i empathize with her, but over gifts? Really? My family uses giftster and my husband hates getting gifts so i have his login and update his list. It takes an incredible amount of self control to not look and see what has been purchased off my list when im on his account. I did one year and then just felt bad. Like it ruined the magic of Christmas for me already knowing what i was getting. Your gf sounds more selfish and materialistic over gifts than anxious.", "NAH. I figure this is a personality trait. Might be one of those love her despite her flaws things. My husband and I haven\u2019t surprised each other in like 12 years. We buy gifts together. We both enjoy that more, so I don\u2019t see the big deal in not liking surprises. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely not an AH at all\u2026 Perhaps it was unnecessary to cancel the order. But she\u2019s never hidden this part of herself from you, and you know fully what you\u2019re getting into. I certainly don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH for not liking surprises or having some level of anxiety about it. Plenty of people don\u2019t like surprises, and it doesn\u2019t mean she appreciates your gifts any less.\n\nIf it is more important to you to have someone who loves surprises than to speak to her in her love language then there\u2019s an incompatibility. I\u2019d hope you could get past it.", "NTA. Why should you be with someone you don't trust? I question she's simply sneaking about for gifts (OP)", "On point.", "I'm the same way.  I feel anxious that my reaction won't be what is expected.  If it's bad, I don't want to make some one feel bad.  I'm close with my BIL and he gives terrible gifts, so I like to know ahead of time so I'm not sad surprised with the gifts.", "No, she doesn't. It's really only when it comes to gifts which is why it is so puzzling. It would make more sense if she went around telling everyone what she got them, but her lips are completely sealed up until the gift is open and in our hands.", "If gifts give her anxiety, there is his out to never buy her one again.  Problem solved.", "How did he not communicate?", "Hi, thank you for your comment. She never wants anything in specific, she tells me that I know what she likes and I can find whatever I think she will like. The surprise aspect just means a lot to me because I spend hours trying to find the perfect gift. I understand that is not for everybody.", "To each his (or her) own. Some (like my eldest sister) don\u2019t celebrate at all. The rest of my immediate family goes all-out and we try our best to make the presents surprises.", "The joy of how bad I am at wrapping things is no one can open then try to rewrap lol", "Also, sidenote: the fact that she blew up and went 0-100 is also a red flag, like the ones I noted previously. That's an adult temper tantrum. From what you said, she lives *with you*  in *YOUR*  home- she has NO right to tell you to leave. Honestly if it were me, I would pack her a small bag and tell her that if she's going to disrespect you and throw a temper tantrum, she is welcome to find somewhere else to stay the night until she understands she's suffering consequences of her OWN actions. And that she has no right to treat you like that in your home. Another huge red flag.", "So she violates his privacy, takes away his joy at gift giving, kicks him out of his house, and he's the bad guy?", "Oh that is not the issue at all, I have generalized anxiety disorder so I am quite familiar. She's just never told me the gift snooping was because of anxiety until now That's why I'm feeling guilty. She's seeing a therapist, that's as far as she's told me.", "Seems exceptionally selfish to me and the majority of people here. I pity your husband.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "She\u2019s not trying to hide it or be \u201cgood at it\u201d after his ultimatum. It\u2019s a power play. She\u2019s effectively calling him out and forcing him to either endorse her behaviour (let her keep the gift) or be the bad guy and take it away. Exactly like a toddler pushing boundaries. She played a stupid game and won a stupid prize. I\u2019m glad OP stuck to his guns and did what he said he\u2019d do, otherwise she would continue to stomp every boundary he ever tries to set.", "I've known people like this. They think it's a cute quirk they have. Then when they're called on it and told it's not cute they call it anxiety and guilt the other person for not being ok with it.", "Love it. Best solution ever lol", "INFO: You\u2019re NTA but I am curious\u2014 how does she get into your phone and laptop? Are these not password protected? Did you tell her the password once and she just uses it whenever now?", "You need a prenup though.  Trust me; it will save you an enormous, expensive fight.  When a gf starts ordering *you* out of *your  own house*... buddy, if your marriage goes sideways, she's going to pull an Ivana Trump: \"Don't get even, get everything.\"\n\nTell her now that you'll be getting a prenup and keeping your finances separate.  Trust me, the reaction will be very educational for you.", "I mean snooping through his phone and his emails is a pretty big red flag.", "If it's never come up until now, that's quite convenient timing don't you think? Got to wonder what else is happening that you've just not caught her out on yet", "Not really - going on 50 years.  I\u2019m just not getting all the red flags.  He hasn\u2019t mentioned any other major areas of issues with her.", "It\u2019s all in the dynamics here.  I didn\u2019t realize she actually looked in his phone. That\u2019s a different kind of thing.", "Perhaps if people want to surprise you, they can commit to a price limit?\n\nFor example, everyone's feeling a bit broke this year, so we're doing a Secret Santa - $50 limit. Having agreed expectations across a group in this way (or similar) might be helpful to you?\n\n(But also, with a few of my relatives it's totally ok to just agree what we're getting each other, my Mum has literally taken me shopping for my own present in the past so that she knows I'll like it.)", "My phone, I'm not sure. My laptop isn't password protected because she likes to use it sometimes (she doesn't have her own) but maybe through saved info on my laptop? Thank you for your comment.", "Oh shoot, I didn\u2019t pick up on that.  I\u2019m 70 and didnt automatically think of phone snooping.  But yeah that puts it in a different light.  Wonder why phone isn\u2019t password protected.", "It foes not nature thay she snooped in his phone. The fact of the matter is that he told hee not to ruin. Hee surprised he told her that he does not like it and that if she attempted to ruin it thay he would return the gift because that's how much it means to gim ans she gave zero fucks abiht his boundaries. Doesn't nattwr if she looked in a closet or attic for it or she snooped in his phone. She snooped when he told her not too. She's a boundary stomping asshole and that's a red flag.", "Idk a lot about phones, but if your laptop is Windows, for sure you can setup different accounts and let her login only in one, or password-protect spedific folders, though that would not do much if she could access your email on your browser.\n\nOr you could tell her that looking at your email and texts for any reason is not acceptable.", "Yeah, I kind of get that, but I don\u2019t get all the red flag warnings.", "If you ask a partner not to look through your phone and laptop and they do anyway, that\u2019s a massive invasion of privacy that could easily lead to abuse.", "She\u2019s disregarded his complaints for her own wants. If it\u2019s not a red flag it\u2019s at least very selfish and would likely continue until something drastic (like this) happened.", "Because she is invading his privacy when he has specifically established it as an important boundary for himself. Disregarding your partners boundaries like that is a red flag. It would be different if he was ok with it, he\u2019s not, and she should respect that", "Ok, this I understand.  But at 70 I didn\u2019t pick up that she got on his phone and searched.  That is low.", "Yeah and it didn\u2019t register to me that she got into his phone to snoop.  That\u2019s another level.", "It was my mistake, didn\u2019t register that she actually looked in his phone until someone pointed it out to me.  My mind didn\u2019t go to online ordering.", "I love the this thread.  Revolutionarycow was open and changed her opinion and perspective.  That is so wonderful to see- especially online!"]}
