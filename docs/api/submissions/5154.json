THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM.", "Did you overract? - What? -- NTA\n\nShe is out of line, completely. She agreed to no snooping. She snooped & was selling the table as a 'brag'(?) moment...WTH; she literally wanted you to know she knew. She is a self-centered, entitled person who cannot allow someone to gift her a gift. There are tools to manage anxiety but this does not excuse her from treating people with respect and kindness. She went from 0 to 100 telling you to leave.", "NTA.

She promised and I went all out. \n\nNope, NTA. Bring this up to her again if she continues to pout. Also sounds like she is an absolute child by yelling at you to get out of your own home over this. She doesn't deserve the \"something small\" except for maybe the empty space now left by her own decisions. \n\nI agree with there people here too saying that this snooping and anxiety almost certainly does not stop with gift giving. She is 25 and it's time for her to grow up.", "So she's.... going through your emails?

Many of us take great joy in surprising a loved one with a special present; one of my favorite pictures is of my youngest opening a video game console they thought was unavailable.  That look\nof astonished joy is so heartwarming.  \nNTA.  Your girlfriend is rude, and I suffer from extreme anxiety, so I call BS on her excuses for her obnoxious behavior.  I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything. I wouldn\u2019t reward dishonesty and sneaking around.

Your GF sounds genuinely psycho.  Was this blow up the first time she's claimed to have anxiety?  Because it sounds like a BS excuse.  \n\nWhat you did was harsh, but it was consistent with what you laid out for her.

It must be a tough lesson for her, but that doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA \n\nWhy be with someone who doesn\u2019t trust you? I doubt she\u2019s just snooping around for gifts.", "NTA. You set a boundary that she herself agreed to stick to.

You discussed this with her and she agreed not to do it.", "It's normal for a 5-year-old to snoop around in Mom's closet looking for their Christmas gifts. It's just plain rude and rude and probably illegal for a 25-year-old to take their partner's phone/laptop/tablet and get into their accounts and snoop around looking for what they got her. Especially after you specifically told her not to and that it robbed you of the joy of surprising her. She is literally taking something from you here and she doesn't seem to care.\n\nAnd I admit that I don't know much about anxiety, but I have a hard time believing that someone could experience anxiety over wondering what her present is going to be.\n\nNTA.", "This is the absolute definition of  fuck around and you\u2019ll find out . Absolutely NTA", "NTA\n\nYou set a boundary with a consequence. She agreed to said boundary. She's now facing a consequence for her choice. \n\nIf her anxiety makes gift-giving occasions unpleasant for her, then she needs to use her words and discuss the matter when there is no looming gift-giving occasion.  \n\nIt's perfectly fine to decide that for your relationship, you don't do surprise gifts. What's not ok is for her to access your personal email/phone/whatever without your consent. \n\nIf she's going to blame her anxiety then she needs to seek treatment. Do not let her use her mental health concerns as an excuse to violate your privacy. Anxiety is a real issue, but not an excuse for being toxic with a partner.", "I have anxiety and generally do feel better if I know my gifts beforehand (this year I know three gifts because I picked them out myself and asked if they could be my gifts, my partner agreed) but if you had a deal, you had a deal.

That's just not appropriate at all.", "NTA, the fact she couldn't even WAIT is ridiculous. She doesn't have to check, she chose to. Her reaction was way over the top, I don't know what else she expected.", "This is not normal if you are over the age of 12.", "Um, she broke her promise and snooped, then she lost control and ordered you out of your own home.

That\u2019s on her.", "NTA Your girlfriend agreed to this exact scenario if she snooped.", "NTA you warned her, she said okay and promised. However, I would have given this gift still but after that I wouldn't try hard again. Very small gifts from then on out that don't mean much.

If it was me I would call her out on she claiming anxiety over a gift she is getting. It\u2019s ok to be exited but do not claim it\u2019s anxiety. I have an anxiety disorder and I\u2019m calling BS, this is taking advantage over her mental health. \nSeriously, she is freaking out over this? \nIMO it was a bit uncalled for cancelling her Christmas present, that being said even though she is your GF she isn\u2019t entitled to a gift from you. \nI get it we all want material things including myself but throwing a tantrum. \nAlso, lmao she kicked you out of your house. \nLet her cool down and talk it over with her. I would compromise in not making it a surprise but also asking her to respect your privacy. It\u2019s you who is making the purchase.", "Am I the only one that doesn\u2019t understand about giving adults gifts as a surprise? I haven\u2019t done that in years.

Anxiety or not this is not ok.  NTA", "NTA you set a boundary and she ignored it. It's sad that she chose to bite herself in the ass but having anxiety doesn't force you to snoop that was her choice", "NTA\n\nAs someone who can't handle the suspense, I always ask my husband if I can guess what he got me. (I usually get it on the first guess or the second even if it's something totally random) It's kind of become a game, and he gets excited think \"I've got her this year!\" And I'm still always super excited and thankful when I open it up. \n\nBUT.....\n\nI would never snoop and try to find out what the gift is. That's just massive boundary issues....if you warned her (and even if you didn't!) totally okay to have returned it. Especially if you had wanted it to be a surprise. But I'd be worried what other snooping she does, and also, what level of snooping did she do to find out what you got her? Was it a quick browser history on a shared computer? (that's on you for not clearing history then) or did she dive into emails or bank records texts and the like?", "I'm going to take you at your word in your post, and not assume other things (red flag of potential behaviors, etc). You said this is the one thing that bothers you and it's limited to solely her desire to snoop about gifts. \n\nIt's annoying beyond belief when a person spends a lot of time planning a gift, and then the recipient \"cheats\" and finds out what that gift is ahead of time. I've had my share of dealing with GFs and my wife doing the same.   \nHowever, and this is unpopular, but again, I'm taking your comment and not extrapolating further out than what details you provided --> I think returning the gift was not the right move. I would give a YTA, but softly. \n\nWhen giving a gift that has a lot of thought and meaning (such as this make up desk/vanity mirror), the joy is not only in the few minutes after they are surprised and open the gift. I've done the same with my wife, and I felt the joy and excitement for months afterwards as she used her vanity mirror or enjoyed other gifts I gave her. Yes, it would have been frustrating if she had learned of it beforehand. But her learning of the gift earlier would not have taken away the effort I put into the gift, the thoughtfulness I tried to convey with it, and seeing her enjoy it afterwards for a long time. \n\nInstead of the knee-jerk reaction of canceling the gift, having a dialogue about what it means to  you when she snoops and discovers your gifts, and seeing if she understands what her actions do to those around her around the holidays --> this would have been a better method. She acted childish with her snooping; using a childish reaction to her snooping doesn't make it better. \n\nI hope you two can still have a good holiday despite this set back.", "NTA but-and this is probably going to be unpopular-why does the surprise matter so much? She has demonstrated many times that she doesn\u2019t like the surprise part of gift giving and that kinda ruins her experience and giving gifts is still fun even if there is no surprise aspect. She was TA, but you will be TA if you keep buying her gifts and expecting different results.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
