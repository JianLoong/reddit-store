She snooped & was selling the table as a 'brag'(?) moment...WTH; she literally wanted you to know she knew. She is a self-centered, entitled person who cannot allow someone to gift her a gift. There are tools to manage anxiety but this does not excuse her from treating people with respect and kindness. She went from 0 to 100 telling you to leave.", "NTA.

She doesn't deserve the \"something small\" except for maybe the empty space now left by her own decisions. \n\nI agree with there people here too saying that this snooping and anxiety almost certainly does not stop with gift giving.

That look\nof astonished joy is so heartwarming.  \nNTA.  Your girlfriend is rude, and I suffer from extreme anxiety, so I call BS on her excuses for her obnoxious behavior.  I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything. I wouldn\u2019t reward dishonesty and sneaking around.

Your GF sounds genuinely psycho.  Was this blow up the first time she's claimed to have anxiety?  Because it sounds like a BS excuse.  \n\nWhat you did was harsh, but it was consistent with what you laid out for her.

Especially after you specifically told her not to and that it robbed you of the joy of surprising her.

She's now facing a consequence for her choice. \n\nIf her anxiety makes gift-giving occasions unpleasant for her, then she needs to use her words and discuss the matter when there is no looming gift-giving occasion.  \n\nIt's perfectly fine to decide that for your relationship, you don't do surprise gifts. What's not ok is for her to access your personal email/phone/whatever without your consent. \n\nIf she's going to blame her anxiety then she needs to seek treatment. Do not let her use her mental health concerns as an excuse to violate your privacy.

That's just not appropriate at all.", "NTA, the fact she couldn't even WAIT is ridiculous. She doesn't have to check, she chose to.

I have an anxiety disorder and I\u2019m calling BS, this is taking advantage over her mental health. \nSeriously, she is freaking out over this? \nIMO it was a bit uncalled for cancelling her Christmas present, that being said even though she is your GF she isn\u2019t entitled to a gift from you. \nI get it we all want material things including myself but throwing a tantrum. \nAlso, lmao she kicked you out of your house. \nLet her cool down and talk it over with her.

Anxiety or not this is not ok.  NTA", "NTA you set a boundary and she ignored it. It's sad that she chose to bite herself in the ass but having anxiety doesn't force you to snoop that was her choice", "NTA\n\nAs someone who can't handle the suspense, I always ask my husband if I can guess what he got me. (I usually get it on the first guess or the second even if it's something totally random) It's kind of become a game, and he gets excited think \"I've got her this year!\" And I'm still always super excited and thankful when I open it up. \n\nBUT.....\n\nI would never snoop and try to find out what the gift is. That's just massive boundary issues....if you warned her (and even if you didn't!) totally okay to have returned it. Especially if you had wanted it to be a surprise. But I'd be worried what other snooping she does, and also, what level of snooping did she do to find out what you got her? Was it a quick browser history on a shared computer? (that's on you for not clearing history then) or did she dive into emails or bank records texts and the like?", "I'm going to take you at your word in your post, and not assume other things (red flag of potential behaviors, etc). You said this is the one thing that bothers you and it's limited to solely her desire to snoop about gifts. \n\nIt's annoying beyond belief when a person spends a lot of time planning a gift, and then the recipient \"cheats\" and finds out what that gift is ahead of time. I've had my share of dealing with GFs and my wife doing the same.   \nHowever, and this is unpopular, but again, I'm taking your comment and not extrapolating further out than what details you provided --> I think returning the gift was not the right move. I would give a YTA, but softly. \n\nWhen giving a gift that has a lot of thought and meaning (such as this make up desk/vanity mirror), the joy is not only in the few minutes after they are surprised and open the gift. I've done the same with my wife, and I felt the joy and excitement for months afterwards as she used her vanity mirror or enjoyed other gifts I gave her. Yes, it would have been frustrating if she had learned of it beforehand. But her learning of the gift earlier would not have taken away the effort I put into the gift, the thoughtfulness I tried to convey with it, and seeing her enjoy it afterwards for a long time. \n\nInstead of the knee-jerk reaction of canceling the gift, having a dialogue about what it means to  you when she snoops and discovers your gifts, and seeing if she understands what her actions do to those around her around the holidays --> this would have been a better method. She acted childish with her snooping; using a childish reaction to her snooping doesn't make it better. \n\nI hope you two can still have a good holiday despite this set back.", "NTA but-and this is probably going to be unpopular-why does the surprise matter so much? She has demonstrated many times that she doesn\u2019t like the surprise part of gift giving and that kinda ruins her experience and giving gifts is still fun even if there is no surprise aspect. She was TA, but you will be TA if you keep buying her gifts and expecting different results.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Another year, he bought me a first edition book that I wouldn't have bought myself because I would have felt guilty about spending that much on myself.  Then there was the year he bought me 12 pairs of work gloves.  His reasoning was simple.  I'm a writer, but I liked helping him build fences, tear down old barns, etc.  He didn't want my hands to get hurt/messed up and he knew I could be absent minded, so 12 pairs of work gloves should last me the 12 months of the year.

I\u2019d be second guessing that, boundaries aren\u2019t something that should be crossed whatsoever. NTA, I\u2019d have some serious thoughts about all the snooping she does, seems like she goes into extreme lengths. Want to be dealing with that for the rest of your life if you continue on?

She didn\u2019t even try to hide her snooping this time and then had the audacity to get mad at you for cancelling it when you told her snooping wouldn\u2019t be tolerated? Nah nta at all.

Until then, no dice.", "NTA-that's what she gets for snooping, you told her what would happen. \n\nalso if she really has such a problem with Snooping, i'd put a bit more security on all your devices and other private matters: change your passwords and keep any important documents in a more safe and locked area, maybe even get separate accounts for certain things, especially if she's freaking out and telling you to leave your own house, she might not be alright up there. not to mention that she's just bad at hiding it. \n\n also, i've never heard of someone getting anxiety over not knowing what their present is, i thought not knowing was supposed to be what made it fun but eh, sometimes i guess it's not fun for everyone. She needs a therapist.", "NTA. She is ruining the best part of Christmas imo", "When I was very little I was a fan of The Flintstones. I wasn\u2019t much of a doll person, but the commercials were really cool and I decided I wanted Pebbles & Bam Bam dolls. I discovered that my mom had bought me Pebbles, so when my aunt asked what I wanted I very confidently told her that I knew I was getting Pebbles, I wanted her to get me Bam Bam. Christmas came. I got Bam Bam. Couldn\u2019t think of much to do with a Bam Bam and no Pebbles.\n\nBetter than my older brother. When he was really little he found *all* of his presents hidden in the attic and peeked. Mom was, in those days, the head of an orphanage. Every single one of those packages ended up under the orphanage tree.\n\nYour girlfriend seems to be learning this lesson a bit late. Oh, well. Better late than never, I suppose.\n\nNTA", "NTA, there's fundamental issues here. Not only does she not keep her word to you, she also invades privacy. She needs to be in control and she is emotionally immature and blows up if she doesn't get it.\n\nSure it kind of could be an anxiety thing, but guess what, the level of behavior here means she doesn't get some pass for an eccentricity. She is going out of her way to be an asshole and the first time it started getting called out was the time she should have been working on fixing it. Instead she is clearly and with calculation violating agreements she makes with other people.\n\nYou did not overreact, but honestly it sounds like you need to dig into whether or not there's a future in a relationship with someone who doesn't respect you, isn't going to put in work to stop disrespecting the people in her life, seemingly showing that she doesn't think they deserve better, and is willing to lash out at them if she doesn't have complete control.\n\nAnd you really should listen to the advice of everyone else and start changing all your passwords on things and making sure you weren't being tracked. The level of control she is exercising over your life, and the invasions of privacy she is already committed, should make you concerned about what you haven't noticed yet.

However, the only thing I will mention is that gift anxiety is a real thing. My son has it, but is also on the spectrum, so he gives me a list and that\u2019s what I buy for him. I try to help him learn what it\u2019s like to receive surprises by adding in other gifts that are unknown. \n\nBut anyway, in your situation, I would just sit down and make it very clear that\u2019s she ruining the holidays for you by robbing you of the experience of planning an awesome surprise and getting the satisfaction of seeing her joy at opening an actual, well-planned gift.", "NTA.

I love and appreciate gifts - I don\u2019t like performing gratefulness for an audience where I could get it wrong or disappoint somebody. That being said, I would NEVER snoop by invading the privacy of my partner that way. I might ask and cajole and guess or peek at the present when it\u2019s under the tree the night before but I would NEVER break into private information or private spaces like a phone or laptop.

You have to decide whether you are okay with staying in a relationship with this person or not.", "INFO\n\nDid she physically snoop through the house to find the physical gift or was she virtually snooping through your phone and laptop?  OP can easily solve the first problem by having the gifts shipped to his office or a storage unit so she can't find them.  OP can easily solve the second problem by being sure she has no access to OP's devices because they are password protected.\n\nI personally prefer non-surprise gifts.  I ask my wife what she wants and buy it.  I hate buying things she doesn't like and then she pretends to like it to be nice.", "NTA, you told her what would happen if she snooped, she did it anyway and got the consequences. Her going through all your stuff is major red flags, though.  \n\nOn the topic of snooping, I used to be really bad about it when I was younger (specifically when I was a little kid/teen), but I stopped once I realized that it was better to see the reaction of the gift giver when they see your reaction to getting it. For that same reason, I have to stop myself from spoiling gifts before I give them because I'm so excited for their reaction. Point being, snoopers bad.", "NTA, she behaved like a child.  Going through your devices to snoop when she promised not to is a crappy thing to do.  Rubbing your face in it afterwards was just as bad.  Losing her shit over the consequences that she was already well aware of is even worse.", "NTA- blatantly disregarding the agreement you made, snooping through your phone, trying to kick you out of your own home, she's not a keeper, sorry.", "Not only is she dishonest, she also isn\u2019t that bright if she just let you find out so easily. Maybe she\u2019s subconsciously sabotaging this relationship honestly \ud83d\ude02 but for real if this is an actual problem for her then she needs to sit you down and help you to understand and then you guys find a solution. Maybe she stresses because she wants to get you something just as good! It\u2019s hard to buy for partners sometimes. Maybe instead if gifts you guys go in getaways or something together", "Her natural curiosity doesn\u2019t make her snoop; her wanting to snoop is making her snoop. I\u2019m also curious by nature but haven\u2019t snooped for gifts since I was 11 or 12. \n\nGood on you for returning the gift, since she clearly doesn\u2019t deserve it. NTA", "NTA she snooped through your email/accounts and then threw you out of YOUR house? Absolutely not. This isn't anxiety this is selfishness. She is purposefully ignoring and stomping over your boundaries and gaslighting you. What else is she snooping for? What other boundaries does she blame you for her stomping?", "NTA, but I'd suggest a counselor to see if this behavior in your gf is something she can control or a sign of something serious.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is using her anxiety as a bullshit excuse to stomp boundaries. There's no way this red flag hasn't been waving all over the place in other scenarios.

Ate you a therapist that brings work home with you? She had anxiety about GETTING GIFTS and then tries to sell them before she ever gets them? No. She's calculating. Good luck!", "I would put absolutely no further effort into gift giving for her. Cash for all future gifts on all occasions. And I'd tell her she doesn't need to snoop again ever. It will be cash. Always.", "My family--including me as a kid--had a bad snooping problem. And my mother, who fussed at us kids for doing it, was the worst! She could unwrap a gift and rewrap it so expertly in the same paper that you'd never know, so we kept her presents hidden and never put them under the tree.\n\nI told this to my then-boyfriend and he was kind of appalled. Said he wanted to surprise people. He only had to tell me ONCE.  I told him I would never snoop around for Christmas presents, and I never have.\n\nYour girlfriend was told multiple times and still did it. That has nothing to do with anxiety.", "Weaponizing mental health is a fun new trick!", "My wife has severe anxiety and used to snoop presents as a kid but she doesn\u2019t do it to me because she respects me and knew it would upset me. So that\u2019s not even a good excuse. It\u2019s a total cop out.", "Weaponizing anxiety to excuse her behavior is a major red flag, add that in with the explosive reaction to consequences and you've got the making of an abusive relationship. \n\nMy cousin had some depression struggles that made him overly sympathetic to his gf's 'anxiety'. She excused boundary stomping and overly controlling behavior by saying she was too anxious about what he was doing when she wasn't around, or too worried he'd make the wrong choice so she was just looking out for him. It escalated into physical attacks after they had a baby, then he finally saw through her bs. Once he got out and felt comfortable sharing details, it was disturbing how much she managed to convince him that her abusive behavior was his fault for not doing enough to satiate her anxiety.", "NTA.  When she tells you to get out of your own house because the gift she has not been given did not arrive at your house after you warned her of the consequences for invading your privacy she has crossed the final boundary.
