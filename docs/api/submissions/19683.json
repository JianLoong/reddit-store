Its not like super thriving or anything, but its a small group of about 4 regular people (including me) and we meet for a few hours at least twice a month at the local library. The four of us (Me (32F), Lucy (40s F), Susan (40s? F), and Polly (30s F) (names made up, lmk if you get the reference lol) pretty much attend all of the gatherings and a few other people pop in when they have the time to join us. The entire Facebook group is only like 18 people. we usually just craft and chat together, vent about our partners, troubleshoot problems, etc. its typically a pretty chill group dynamic.\n\n\r  \nBut in the last few months, Polly has been making this group kind of suck to attend. She's been kind of mean and judgey to other members of the group, especially \"non-regulars\" that try to join. if you call her out on it, she just all \"what do you mean? I was /complimenting/ her!\" I'm pretty sure she's the reason why some of the other people don't come back or come less often.\n\n\r  \nLucy and Susan stick around mostly because they just really don't GAF, and i haven't left because... well I started the group and I don't want to leave it. Especially because I do a lot of the planning and coordinating. I run the Facebook group to schedule meetups, I schedule days with the Library to book our meeting room, I paid the Annual Fee with the Library (technically its not in our county, but its the closest one to us). So i feel like its \"My\" knitting group (not in a \"my group my rules\" kind of way, but in that i kind of lead the group and its kind of my baby passion and I worked hard to keep this group running and so i feel a little possessive about it).\n\n\r  \nI've talked to Lucy and Susan about Polly's behavior and they are very much of the \"don't rock the boat, don't cause drama\" kind of people. So if I were to try to have a conversation with Polly, it would literally end up being me with 0 backup,. \n\n\r  \nSo I was thinking about creating a new group that meets on Sunday's or Wednesdays because Polly can't meet on those days because of Church Stuff, But Susan thinks that it will cause Drama if Polly finds out about the group. Lucy thinks that a good compromise would be to add every other wednesday as a second group meet day during the week and keep Polly as part of the group, and still meet every other thursday. Which seems like a good idea, but I think some members will still not come if they think Polly is invited, plus I would still have to do the booking/scheduling for \"her days\" and she would still be involved in other group activities, so i would be doubling my work with this. I just am tired of dealing with Polly's trash attitude and I just want to have a crafting group without the toxic attitude.

Just tell them your schedule is changing and those are the only times that work for you. Start something new and let everyone else decide which group to be in.", "YTA lol. has anyone actually talked to polly abt her behavior? i get that you're fed up but she wouldn't even know she's being a problem unless someone actually TALKS to her about it. if she's dismissive abt it, there, you have your anwser, but this all feels like something high schoolers would not, people in their thirties or fourties.", "nothing specific to me. This isn't like a formal thing where someone would send me their grievances with another person. I do notice that a few of the non-regulars are more likely to attend things if Polly isnt going to be there but i don't really have enough \"data\" to extrapolate. I just notice that sometimes when the non-regulrs join, she tends to be \"meaner\" and i can tell that sometimes people are put off by her but don't say anything. Plus i don't want to reach out to other members to ask what they think of Polly because that could also cause drama imho if it gets back to Polly. \n\nMy friends who sometimes join have said she kind of \"comes off bitchy\" but that could also be because I kind of complain about her to my friends, so I don't trust that they are unbiased. \n\nI know that there will be drama. every knitting group in the world has some kind of drama. I just hate that the thing i created for fun and meeting people in my community has just kind of become \\~work\\~ now.", "If i know Polly, she will 100% turn herself into the victim. She's also a \"i'm just being honest and i want you to be honest with me toO!\" except not really. Nothing she does is wrong, her stitches are NEVEr uneven, the color pooling is always \"intentional\" etc. but she has no problem commenting on people's yarn choice (she's like a yarn snob but in reverse). color choices, etc. Always has something negative to say when someone mentions something they are excited about. etc. She's also REALLY judge-y about people who crochet or bring non-knitting stuff to the meetups, even though its specifically a crafting group (mostly knitting). \n\nBut she never says anything outright out of pocket. it's always this thinly veiled shroud of \"politeness.\" she's REALLY good at turning situations around on other people. its almost an artform.", "Maybe the best way to deal would be to turn it around on her. Be Pollyanna to her Polly. When she comments \"helpfully\" on people's things, go in with genuine praise. Double points if you take something she's said passive aggressively and just be nice about it. \n\nHonestly, an attitude of being happy, kind and just slightly stupid (to misunderstand her digs on purpose) is a powerful weapon. If she says \"I don't know who would bring crochet to a knitting circle\", misunderstand her and go \"I know, it's so good to see more crafts! \u2728\u2764\ufe0f\u2728\u2764\ufe0f\" and so on.", "I'm well versed in Southern Polite Speak lmao. So i usually ive as much as she gives. But its exhausting and i hate it lol.", "Haha, good then. But yeah, I can see it being exhausting, and you want to be able to relax in your own crafts group.\n\nI just want to warn you that every time I've tried to move a group thing to exclude a highly annoying person, it has bit me in the ass. You're really NTA f\u00f6r wanting to do it, and maybe you should try, but be prepared for the possibility of her managing to bring even more unpleasantness somehow."]}
