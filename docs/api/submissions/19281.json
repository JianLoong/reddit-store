That\u2019s on you.\n\nNext time, if there is a next time... let your wife go by herself to help her mother & you & your wallet stay home.", ">that\u2019s mine in a certain way\n\nPraying for this relationship \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "Yours in a certain way?\n\nWow.", "WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?\n\nI'll give judgement upthread, where it counts.", "So if it's your wife's money too, why are you acting like YOU did some great thing for your MIL and YOU are the one who needs to be reimbursed?", "So by your logic, if her money is yours \u201cin a certain way\u201d, the money you spent in groceries is hers \u201cin a certain way\u201d, and she chose to help her mom with it.", "So you went, knowing mother-in-law is struggling financially, and didn\u2019t ask you to do any such thing. But you are asserting right here yep you want to be paid back, and it better not be from your wife, you want it from mother-in-law.\n\nAsshole", "Please help me understand: your MIL is financially struggling. Your wife and you decide to go shopping for her, she did not ask for it, nor was consulted on what to buy. And you expect her to pay you back? Why would she do that?", "So you went and spent someone else\u2019s money without their consent, and now expect to be paid back for it.\n\nDo you understand how \u201chelping\u201d actually works? Because based on this, you don\u2019t understand how helping someone actually works. Hint: this is not helping. \n\nBut it is making you look like a miserly asshole. \n\nYTA.", "And I'm sure your wife wants a partner who isn't an ass", "Well, where I understand where you're coming from, it is 100% an asshole move. I'm not going to try and shame you because, like I said, I get it. But you have to realize that YTA in this situation, and will be seen as such by those closest to you.", "If anyone owes you money it\u2019s your wife. Not your MIL. How are you missing this? If you wife paid for a gift to bring to your mother... you would be on the hook to reimburse her the money... Not your mother.  \n\nMIL didn\u2019t ask for any groceries. It was your wife\u2019s decision to give her mother food .... Let your wife pay you. Then maybe get some details before you offer to help again.", "So, you basically decided to \"lend\" your MIL money and dictate how it was spent without her consent. All under the pretense of being \"helpful\".", "You can't expect to be paid back for something when they didn't ask for it though.\n\nThat's like me having a sweet tooth and my friend brings me an elaborate cake that I can't afford and didn't ask for. Then says, Oh by the way, you can pay me back later.\n\nIt doesn't work that way OP!!!!", "YTA. MIL neither asked for you to do this nor even got to CHOOSE the groceries. She owes you nothing. You gifted her some things. \u201cThanks\u201d ought to cover it.", "Then why did you offer in the first place without saying that?", "And that's what makes you the asshole.", "It\u2019s good to want things, builds character- and you could use some", "For what? You said in your post you wanted to help.\n\nWhat was the help in doing something she didn't ask and then you expecting to be paid?", "Because she doesn\u2019t have to offer or pay you back for it! This a favor that you did clearly not out of kindness which she never asked of you and you also clearly don\u2019t know how to shop. And now you want money back for it. Get over yourself.", "Because she doesn't have to.  That's what a gift is.", "I dont see fault on anyone but him in this case.  \"They\" did MIL a favor without being asked, then he expects payment?  Did I miss something?\n\nSo you and I are friends and I walk up to you and tell you I bought 2 sodas, decided to get you one while I was buying mine.  Would you be taken aback if I suddenly held out my hand expecting payment for something you never asked for?", "No OP wanted mil to take responsibility. If the wife spends all their combined income supporting her mom it affects them both.", "The bottom line is OP does not want to have to subsidize his mother-in-law\u2018s lifestyle and he shouldn\u2019t be expected to. That\u2019s where this is going. He probably feels like he\u2019s going to have to start paying all his mother-in-law\u2018s bills. Better to be clear he doesn\u2019t want to support her.", "Yes! My grandmother used to always \"pay us back\" by making us things. Like I'd buy a load of food, but I'd also throw in ingredients for a dish I really like, like lasagna or chili, that she made super well - and she would make a big batch and divvy it up between the grandkids. That way she didn't feel like she was getting a handout, we got to help (which is all we wanted to do anyway), but we also got delicious food in the deal. Usually she'd also make some tea buns or cookies to \"sweeten\" the deal.  \n\n\nGod, I miss my grandmother.  \n\n\nAnyway, point is, YTA and there are so many other ways this could have been resolved without being a miserable human. Unless you secretly actually actually dislike your MIL and this is your passive-aggressive way to show that.", "Seriously! The woman I share an office with will try to pay me back when I pick her up a croissant at starbucks and im like. no. If I text you and say \"do you want anything from starbucks?\" and she says yes, maybe she has to pay me back for that. But if I buy you a croissant unsolicited, that was MY choice to do something nice for you.", "This is what\u2019s so baffling to me!\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask us to do that, we did it because we wanted to help her\u201d\n\nwhat the actual fuck, to expect reimbursement?\n\nOP, YTA", "OP doesn\u2019t seem to understand what a Gift is.", "I agree with you. The problem is what mess up revealed about his character. OP has just shown himself to be someone who is more concerned about their bottom line and personal wealth than about genuine concern and love for someone struggling, especially family.\n\nSure, he\u2019ll help you, as long as it doesn\u2019t cost him too much. And if he decides the cost is too high then you\u2019ll regret accepting any help to begin with. In this instance, it will likely even poison the relationship between mother and daughter.\n\nThat kind of character doesn\u2019t make for a long or happy marriage. That\u2019s not someone that stays \u201cthrough sickness and health\u201d without resentment growing over the personal sacrifices needing to be made.\n\nScore keeping, *especially for unasked for help*, is a death sentence in a relationship.\n\nOP, you better figure this out sooner rather than later and rectify it because otherwise this is not going to end well for anyone let alone you.", "You are right. Saying the wrong thing at the wrong time is right up there with burning the MILs house down and stealing her identity. They should absolutely get a divorce and not work on the relationship in any way and OP and myself should commit seppuku for not understanding that.", "I wrote this before OP clarified that. I am kind of speechless.", "I was looking for this comment. The wife can\u2019t pay him back because her money is supposedly already his, but his money isn\u2019t hers to be used for groceries. Unbelievable.\n\nTo OP: yes, of course YTA. You are a major AH. \n\nTo the OP\u2019s wife: RUN! You deserve so much better than this.", "Praying for it to end\u2026", "OP was not asked by MIL to buy groceries. You don't buy something unasked as that makes it a gift. You don't expect to be repaid for unsolicited gifts. \n\nOP chose to buy groceries, his choice he 100% pays for. YTA", "Her lifestyle? It\u2019s food.... Then don\u2019t get involved \u201cwith helping\u201d. Let wife go shopping & bring MIL food with her own money.\n\nBtw \u2014- MIL never asked for help. So if anyone is paying OP back, it\u2019s his wife. It was her choice to do this & OP was a willing participant.", "He should\u2019ve had that conversation with the wife before they went shopping and spent money he now expects mother-in-law to cough up. \n\nYou don\u2019t spend somebody else\u2019s money without so much as a discussion, give them a bill and then go, \u201cI helped you, aren\u2019t you so happy??\u201d", "Except MIL didn't ask them to do this. OP and his wife took it upon themselves to do it allegedly to help her, but he's now asking to be reimbursed for something she didn't ask for.", "Bingo. It\u2019s literally NOT the mess up itself but what it SAYS about his CHARACTER", "Or you could wake up.", "I busted out laughing at this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d it needs as much prayer as it can get", "Right? He put his MIL in debt she did not consent to, and she didn't even get to pick her own food!"]}
