You responded (and I feel like it's pretty clear that it was an empty threat), so...she got what she wanted?\n\nIf you had made a joke/empty threat about something that was precious or irreplaceable, that would have been going too far. The humor absolutely would have missed the mark in that case.\n\nI get this isn't a *serious* disagreement, but your wife was being pretty annoying and your response was clearly a joke, so she's not truly TA but she needs to lighten up a bit.\n\n(If she has any tips to share about where to get good-quality puzzles, new or used, for less-than-ridiculous prices, I'm all ears, lol)", "NTA.

You\u2019re welcome.", "NTA\n\nDo it anyways. Lol", "Hahahha that's a hilarious threat. I'm going to use that sometime. Actually that could make a fun game.

Does she always push boundaries like this?  Seems like she has zero respect for you and your responsibilities.

He told her to stop and that if she wouldn't, he'd mess up the puzzles (which he didn't actually do). I think that OP did a good job by telling his wife to stop, and to what level she was bugging/annoying him.

As a fellow husband that also threatens the nuclear option from time to time, I tip my hat to you. Tell her you would just be enhancing her puzzle experience...\n\nYou have a good relationship.
