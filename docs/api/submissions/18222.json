You responded (and I feel like it's pretty clear that it was an empty threat), so...she got what she wanted?\n\nIf you had made a joke/empty threat about something that was precious or irreplaceable, that would have been going too far. The humor absolutely would have missed the mark in that case.\n\nI get this isn't a *serious* disagreement, but your wife was being pretty annoying and your response was clearly a joke, so she's not truly TA but she needs to lighten up a bit.\n\n(If she has any tips to share about where to get good-quality puzzles, new or used, for less-than-ridiculous prices, I'm all ears, lol)", "NTA.
