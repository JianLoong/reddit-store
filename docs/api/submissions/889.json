I smoke cigarettes and this is the only place I smoke. I've lived here for 6 years, always done the same. A few weeks ago a new neighbor moved in 2 doors down. He came over at night a week ago and asked if I could not smoke on my patio. He says the smoke is going in his window and his wife has asthma. I spoke to our property manager who said that was unreasonable on his part and to ignore it. He came back over tonight and I told him he needed to go, that it wasn't okay for him to come to my patio at night in a confrontational way and to please go. I had to ask him 3 times to go. \n\nI do feel for him about the smoke, but I am smoking outside on my patio. Our townhomes have lots of windows and it seems to be one window the smoke floats to when the wind is moving the wrong direction.  So, I think he could close that window in the few hours I am home and awake. Right?\n\nI told him no, in part as a knee jerk response because he walked onto my patio at night, and was confrontational. This was my introduction to the guy. But also...I'm outside on my patio! \n\nI am a conscientious smoker and before this can turn into a referendum on smoking in general, I know....I know. I have PTSD and I swear it keeps me breathing and I'm aware of the potential irony there.\n\nEta: Thank you everyone for your perspectives. I am absolutely interested in compromise and will try to help with the issue. Thinking about a fan, and or a specified time frame. \n\nHis approach, at night, so mad he was shaking, when I'm minding my business, completely unaware of the problem, really threw me. I'm also a woman, I work hard, I have worked hard to make my backyard a sanctuary and am pissed that this woman seems to have sent a man over to my back patio at night to confront me. So, there's a part of me who thinks she should ovary up and speak to me.\n\nWe are having a weird \"gentrification process\" 6 years ago I paid 60,000 for a 1930s town home, 3 of my other neighbors smoked, including the one in new guy's house. My direct neighbor smoked inside and I wasn't thrilled about that, but we were all very live and let live. \nNobody mentions weed or grills or the occasional college kids having a late night. It was safe and calm, chill. \n\nNow, our property is selling in the $200,000s and we're getting the kind of people who would have turned their nose up at the property 6 years ago. Same property, mostly the same residents. I also have received a beautification award here and have been asked to be on the board because of my work around our building. New guy had to have the 200 year old oak at the end of our building cut down because it was too \"dark\" over there. So, he stepped off on the wrong foot. A few more days and I would have been over there with a homemade pie and invited them to let me know if they needed anything. \n\nRant over.\n\nStill, I do care that this lady has asthma and am willing to find some kind of workaround and I appreciate even the YTAs.
