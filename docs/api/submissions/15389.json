Again though I disapproved for aforementioned reasons. She is on disability and my brother\u2019s child is on welfare since the mom is also on welfare. My brother has recently found out his kid is having seizures. This is taking a mental and financial toll on him having to help with all of this. My brother\u2019s a truck driver making decent money but still struggles as he bought a house, two newer vehicles, and is doing work to that home making it more comfortable for him and his family. \n\nI have been approached by my more influential family members to provide substantial financial support for them since they think I can afford it. I do have the ability to do so but at a cost to my lifestyle. Sure I have money and I can afford to help them but I don\u2019t think I should be having to do so as he put himself in this situation he is in.

You couldn't be more contemptuous of her if you tried. \n\nYou don't need to give financial assistance if you don't want to, but you need to stop resenting this woman for merely existing if you don't want to be an AH.

I understand not wanting to help as I had a family member who would often try to live above their means and often turn to me to help when they would overdraft the account.

The new variant attaches to CD8 which continues to disable many each day. Hong Kong just released the longest Long Covid study. 70% had long Covid symptoms that affected way of life. \n\nThat said, your points are valid. As someone disabled I would never ask my partner or extended family to fund the equivalent of welfare/SSI payment a month. You should not have to give up your lifestyle. Let the relatives cough up the money.", "NTA. He bought a house, 2 new cars, and is doing construction work. It is significantly cheaper to rent than what they are doing.

Better still, encourage the whole family to pool together rather than just lumping the burden on you because you're the most well-off.", "NTA, you're right that your brother chose to take this on.

But. Your money, your choice. And it\u2019d be wrong to overly rely on others for monetary help, too.\n\nIt is wrong of your family to try to guilt you into giving. If you don\u2019t want to, forcing you is definitely not an acceptable thing to do.\n\nYour attitude is very judgmental, though, and it alone tempts me to say YTA.

Should they have perhaps planned better about the financial side of things before deciding to have a child? Yeah, maybe. But that also doesn\u2019t make their family \u201cwrong\u201d or that he\u2019s \u201cstuck\u201d with his wife and child. He is doing all he can to make ends meet.

Rather than see her as a person, you only see the diagnosis and inconvenience. \n\n\"I don't want to help if he has to keep his girlfriend around [because she has CP]\" is one of the grossest sentences I've read on this subreddit. How would you feel if someone was talking about some form of help you and your girlfriend needed, and they said that about the two of you? Especially if the issue had nothing to do with interpersonal issues between them and your girlfriend because they'd never even tried to get to know your girlfriend as a person. You don't think you're ablist, and you don't think you \"hate on people with disabilities\" but then you go ahead and write shit like this post.\n\nYou're NTA for not wanting to contribute to the extent that your influential family members are asking.

Just because you are not interested in trying to understand her better you make a ridiculous assumption that she is sub par intellectually and that is perhaps the biggest reason YATA - based on your expert opinion she is getting worse and not better? In what way are you expecting her to get better? By not having Cerebral Palsy anymore? How exactly does their child having seizures have any bearing on her disability? You obviously think your brother has been trapped by this relationship and child that is based purely on your prejudice and inability to see her as a woman and mother let alone a person that you are now needing to help support. You are not obligated to help them financially or in any other way if you choose not to and that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you TA but your obvious feelings of superiority are quite staggering and I am guessing that she could be very intelligent yet not articulate in the way you would deem \u201cnormal\u201d. They didn\u2019t ask you for any help financially or in any other way and you are just trying to make yourself feel better about being an ignorant fool who obviously doesn\u2019t care enough about his own brother to be honest and realise that you are the one who needs their help. I\u2019m sure that they don\u2019t need your pity either but they probably don\u2019t realise how bad you treat them because you are a coward who thinks he is in some way an admirable man by acknowledging the issues that people with a disability are dealing with- you don\u2019t have the first clue and you don\u2019t even have the balls to admit that you don\u2019t understand a single issue that people with disabilities are having to deal with and you are such an embarrassment to your family but especially your brother and his family who have a relationship based on more than what people who don\u2019t know them think they are capable of", "he made his choices and his life will be harder because of it.

Yes, realistically being disabled expensive. Not everyone will deal with the stress a disabled partner can bring. Heck plenty of parents can't handle caring for their disabled children. People like you see disabled people as a burden that smart people would avoid instead of as whole humans worthy of equal opportunity, accessibility, financial stability, healthcare, and love.

But he\u2019s also really ignorant because CP isn\u2019t genetic.", "Niece actually\u2026I just wanted to not give any notion of her gender. Anyway I would be expected to do it through his bank account. My aunt works at the bank he uses back home. She talked it over with her boss and it would be an anonymous donation charity that you can do through the bank. I honestly don\u2019t know how it works all I know is it\u2019s all above water and he will never know who. That way he can pay his stuff off quickly. The whole point from what I\u2019ve gathered is to get his ass off the road asap so he can be with his daughter while they figure out what is wrong with her.", "These are really good points. Like aren't truck drivers away from home a lot? A caretaker is very expensive and they can't expect family to cover those costs.", "CP is not a progressive condition.", "So the problem I\u2019m having here is - CP does NOT progress.

Still makes him the AH\n\nAssuming she has a progressing condition - the time in which this happens is unknown.\n\nI\u2019m not saying OP is responsible for helping them.

That makes him happy.", "Did I miss where he says it was genetic?", "Talk to you brother. I personally think it would be nice to support him in some way. He\u2019s going to struggle with the choices he\u2019s made. That is on him, but you love him and your niece right? Maybe $500 is too much, but even $100 per month for your brother, his partner and your niece to do something with you and your gf as a family. That way it\u2019s not a handout, it\u2019s a shared experience. Just a suggestion.", "Depends on the type of truck driver.  My dad was home for dinner every night.", "Some aspect are, and her doctors (acc to OP) have told her it will get progressively worse.", "Or she has more than one problem. My cousin has CP and other ailments.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s the other ailments that have worsened. The brain damage has remained the same.", "The last comparison I made was all other things being equal. Meaning both women love and care about him equally and would both make him equally happy. The only difference is the ability to walk or not.", "He\u2019s acting like the seizure disorder is from the mother.", "Yeah but to make the payments needed for the house, cars and medical expenses, there is absolutely no way he is not doing at least some over the road trucking.", "And I\u2019m saying to you, that wouldn\u2019t be a factor for me. Who does he love and who makes him happiest. That\u2019s what I want for my brother. If that person has a physically limiting disability, I\u2019d be over to help them if they needed.", "How is he acting like that? I re-read it and don't see any language about the baby's condition being due to the Mom.\n\n\"My brother has recently found out his kid is having seizures.\" That's all I'm seeing.", "Short haul is an average of 60k.  She also has income coming through disability and possibly SSI. Their income is probably around that 80k plus based on thay.  They're not married, so she's also probably on Medicaid.", "That's where you are in idealistic land. I'm giving a scenario where both would give him the same amount of happiness and he loves equally and the same. The factors you keep retorting with don't apply in this scenario. The fact you refuse to answer gives me the answer I need. You and I both know that everyone would pick the one that can walk. If you think your brother can find someone to love without a crippling disability you would want them to find that person. That isn't a bad thing to want for your sibling. You are wanting your sibling to not have to go through the hardships associated with having someone with a severe disability that is only deteriorating. Now the sibling wants you to pay for their choice of being is someone like that. It's like a \"I told you so\" situation. If he can't handle the realities of the situation he put himself in then he shouldn't have done it in the first place.", "The brother isn't even asking for help op admitted this in replies\n\n\n\"No he has not. My brother will not take help of any kind he believes it to be a handout and he absolutely despises handouts. He would be irate for help. No this is my family wanting to provide a comfortable, and safe life for the child.\"", "No. Just no. If you wanted dependants you would have kids.

This is your brother\u2019s WIFE, not his baby mama.", "NAH on the no money which is the question. but y.t.a on why. OPs reasoning sucks and they are way to blunt in how they put things. lets not even start on calling falling in love and having a child as a mistake. \n\nOp is presumably still of an age where they might want to start a family in a few years. and $750 per month every month is a lot of money!  so yeah fine to say no, that amount will never go down and may even go up. \n\nthat said\n\nDisabilities don't make someone less of a person and cerebral palsy doesn't stop her falling in love and being fallen in love with! ffs thats horrible. \n\nAlthough on this I do struggle as I had a close family member with disabilities I never want to be tied to someone with them. there are consequences and I can't say it made for a good childhood, but what can I say, I have trauma. I wouldn't leave someone if it happened but making a choice to start a relationship is different. \n\nThat is a personal choice though others I am really glad to say don't feel the same way! I wouldn't try to discourage or dissaprove of a relationship like this one. also cerebral cerebral palsy is not genetic so it shouldn't have impacted having a child. I am glad that others can find love and be happy, they are doing better than me. \n\nrelated to the above my experiance was a result if an accident.  does op realise that their healthy gf could have a child have things go wrong and end up with a disabled partner and a sick baby? the brother position can happen to anyone! \n\nThe nephew is innocent in all of this and he needs help to. OP shouldn't turn their back. \n\nOp needs to consider if there are ways to help their brother that dont involve a long term financial commitment. their brother is fixing up the house, is this something OP could help to get it done faster etc, maybe occasionally paying for materials. \n\nthis would be a good compromise given house repairs will fall behind treating his sick child! but will make a world of difference to them as a family.", "YTA", "NTA for the question at hand. \n\nyour brother is not asking for a one time loan in time of need - you are asked to continuosly finance your brother and his family and that's kind of effed up.\n\non the other things in your post - you yourself wrote that you don't mind being called ableist, so you are self aware up to a point, I guess", "WTF did I just read?\n\nThis entire post screams \n#AMERICA\n\nIt's all just horrible.", "Ok, first off - is $500 - $750 a month an inconvenience to your comfort, or is it bankrupting you?

Yeah, it's your money, yes you can be selfish with it, totally your right.\n\nBut for the record, every single other thing you've said in your post lands you so far into Ahole territory it's unreal.

Nobody is entitled to your money, but the way you talk about your brother\u2019s girlfriend is horrible.", "Man first paragraph I was ready to give you the benefit of the doubt. Like maybe it's not that she has cerebral palsy but that your brother is irresponsible or something and not the type of person who could handle a relationship that requires different commitments than one might expect...\n\nBut no dude you just took your dickery and ran with it. \"She's not getting better and I see an issue with it\" \"In his infinite wisdom had a child with her\" (You know they could've easily had a kid with no health problems, she could be a great mom even if \"not stabilizing\" and as long as they knew what their general hardships might be what's the issue?) \"I don't want to help them at all at the cost of my lifestyle.\"\n\nMaybe bro didn't need two cars or as expensive as a house as he got but to act like everything is on him because life turned out that way?
