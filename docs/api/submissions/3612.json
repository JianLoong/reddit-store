Sometimes she\u2019s nice and I\u2019m nice and everything is civil, but then there are times where I hate her within an inch of my existence.\n\nI\u2019m only going to list three reasons that go as follows.\n\n1. She told my best friend to go back to their country. They\u2019re Syrian.\n\n2. She keeps making these awful comments about how men are all stupid and should be kept in zoos etc. She makes them LITERALLY. I have two brothers and I\u2019m immensely uncomfortable with her going on about this with me when we aren\u2019t even friends.\n\n3. When we had a group project and we entrusted her with making the PowerPoint and sent her all our parts. Cut to the night before the presentation she tells us she\u2019s going out of town and after hours of begging sends us an incomplete PowerPoint after 12am. We had to edit it at lightning speed during break and even then her part had so many errors.\n\nAdd that with several instances of just plain awful and we have a recipe for a person that I don\u2019t like all that well.\n\nNow to the instance that I might be an asshole.\n\nJen has been absent almost every week for several days a week, and I can count on one hand the amount of days she attends in a month, so on the day before our English Final she texts me out of nowhere going.\n\n\u201cHey OP, can you send me your notes and highlights?\u201d\n\nNow on a normal day, I would have sucked it up and gave her the notes because I\u2019m not the confrontational type but pair this with the fact that my little brother as much as I adore him had been banging on my study room door throwing tantrum after tantrum, my dad wasn\u2019t home from work yet, and my English Teacher had been giving me passive aggressive comments all day\u2026\n\nI snapped.\n\n\u201cJen, we\u2019re all busy, and I\u2019m really stressed, maybe if you were actually in school half the time, you wouldn\u2019t need to ask me for my notes.\u201d\n\nShe snapped right back, telling me she wasn\u2019t in school because she had a serious lung disease and had to have several doctor appointments, and she didn\u2019t flaunt her illness around.\n\nI didn\u2019t know any of this until then, and I apologized, saying maybe if she came the next day I could help her.\n\nShe told me to forget it and asked me not to tell our other classmates. I told her I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nShe\u2019s not the easiest person to get along with, but maybe I crossed a line.\n\nAITA for not giving her my notes and snapping at her?\n\nUpdate: I actually looked back on the conversation we had and I have to make a few corrections.\n\n1. It wasn\u2019t night before English it was revision week and she hadn\u2019t attended and asked me to tell her what the teachers said. Night before finals was a completely different person, I apologize for mixing it up.\n\n2. I didn\u2019t say what I thought I said. Word for word this is the voice note I sent. \u201cListen, Jen, we\u2019re all busy. If you wanted answers why didn\u2019t you come to school? The teacher are all there answering questions. I\u2019m busy studying, we\u2019re all busy studying, I\u2019ve been locked in a room for six hours. I-I honestly don\u2019t have time for this.

If she is upset and doesn\u2019t want your help, then leave her be.

You said this has been going on for at least a month.  There is plenty of time in that month to reach out \"Hey, I missed some days this week, could you send me the notes when you have time...\"  instead of imposing an emergency \"I need this Now, Tonight\" on another person.\n\nRegardless of her health issue, she planned extremely badly and it's reasonable to be annoyed to be asked the night before the test.

You always need to stand up for yourself, especially when you feel taken advantage of. \n\nThat said I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying.

Because you were encouraging the high road in a situation where it would neither be appreciated nor deserved, I was under the impression that you were encouraging OP to always be the bigger person, which I personally disagreed with"]}
