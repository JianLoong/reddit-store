My roommate, Greg, has been seeing this girl, Lisa, for a few weeks. He's head over heels, always talking about her, playing love songs on his guitar, the whole shebang. He told me he was planning a romantic dinner for her at our apartment and asked if I could make myself scarce for the evening. I agreed, thinking I'd just head to a friend's place and chill.\n\nHowever, my plans fell through, and I ended up at home. Not wanting to intrude, I decided to stay in my room. I got a bit bored and thought, \"Why not light up a Dapper Doobie and relax?\" So, I did.\n\nAbout an hour later, I got the munchies. I tiptoed to the kitchen, trying to be as quiet as possible. But as luck would have it, I knocked over a jar of spaghetti sauce. It shattered, sauce went everywhere, and the noise was... well, loud.\n\nGreg and Lisa rushed in, and the look on their faces was a mix of shock and horror. The romantic ambiance was ruined, and there I was, in the middle of the mess, holding a half-eaten sandwich.\n\nLisa found it hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. Greg, on the other hand, was livid. He said I ruined his perfect evening and that I did it on purpose because I was jealous of his new relationship. \n\nI apologized profusely and offered to clean up, but the mood was already killed. Lisa left shortly after, and now Greg isn't talking to me.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for accidentally crashing my roommate's romantic dinner? I'm actually having a really hard time with the anxiety of living with someone that's so upset with me over an accident.", "created_utc": 1697767702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17c05vv/aita_for_ruining_my_roommates_romantic_dinner/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
