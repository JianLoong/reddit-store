My roommate, Greg, has been seeing this girl, Lisa, for a few weeks. He's head over heels, always talking about her, playing love songs on his guitar, the whole shebang. He told me he was planning a romantic dinner for her at our apartment and asked if I could make myself scarce for the evening. I agreed, thinking I'd just head to a friend's place and chill.\n\nHowever, my plans fell through, and I ended up at home. Not wanting to intrude, I decided to stay in my room. I got a bit bored and thought, \"Why not light up a Dapper Doobie and relax?\" So, I did.\n\nAbout an hour later, I got the munchies. I tiptoed to the kitchen, trying to be as quiet as possible. But as luck would have it, I knocked over a jar of spaghetti sauce. It shattered, sauce went everywhere, and the noise was... well, loud.\n\nGreg and Lisa rushed in, and the look on their faces was a mix of shock and horror. The romantic ambiance was ruined, and there I was, in the middle of the mess, holding a half-eaten sandwich.\n\nLisa found it hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. Greg, on the other hand, was livid. He said I ruined his perfect evening and that I did it on purpose because I was jealous of his new relationship. \n\nI apologized profusely and offered to clean up, but the mood was already killed. Lisa left shortly after, and now Greg isn't talking to me.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for accidentally crashing my roommate's romantic dinner? I'm actually having a really hard time with the anxiety of living with someone that's so upset with me over an accident.", "created_utc": 1697767702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17c05vv/aita_for_ruining_my_roommates_romantic_dinner/", "score": 1217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m in NYC, if I had a roommate and they asked for a free night in the apartment I could go do all those things, if I lived in like the middle of nowhere I probably would have maybe one or two spots I could go to, and they may not even be open late.", "Most of those close early evening where I live, except McDonald\u2019s where I wouldn\u2019t want to sit for 4 hours and the park which would be dark, cold and likely wet at this time of year", "Most of those places close in the evening.", "Who wants to dick away 3 or 4 hours of their life? Fuck that shit. Sorry guy, plan fell through and he lives at the house. Get over it.", "No one is being banished.  He agreed to leave the apt and then didn't.  And then made a huge noise/mess in the kitchen while high as fuck and was laughing about it.  Who knows what the roommate though considering he thought he was alone.", "Did he actually say he wouldn't be home? Or t has he would make himself scarce? Could just be a miscommunication. I think scarcer could mean staying out of whatever common area they were using.", "Yep, agree. And it doesn't sound like his first time  so he knew he'd get the munchies and didnt take food into his room first", "Plus being high does not lead to you being stealthy or particularly clever.  It is easy to anticipate you would get the munchies and leave the room and high people are not great at being descrete.", "It's the smell of friendship", "He didn't deliberately break a promise, life happens. He doesn't need to go wonder around outside alone for hours at night because his roommate wants the house to himself. I mean, you're also assuming he lives close to any of these places, that he has money or transportation to get to any of these places. Not everywhere is a booming metropolis", "It wasn't really a promise though. It's more of an 'well yeah okay'", "You're just looking for things to nitpick now.", "To also be fair, does Greg yell because his roommate is always making moves on his GF in a hot tub, clearly holds him in contempt, and actively sabotages his dates after agreeing to leave them alone?", "I don't think he's an AH for being home, I think he's an AH for being such a sloppy mess that he's smashing sh*t and interrupting their evening. Replace weed with alcohol-\n\n\"My roommate was planning a romantic evening with his girlfriend and asked that I stay out of the way. I agreed. Then I went home, got so wasted that I made a huge mess in the kitchen, smashing broken glass and tomato sauce everywhere and interrupting their evening. AITA?\"\n\nYes, I'd say so.", "The roommate asked him not to be there he agreed. Then his plans fell through and he didn't even bother to tell tje roommate. I'm not talking about his wording I'm saying I say what I mean. Most adults do. It's not hard to just do something else for 3 hours even if it's hanging out in the car.", "Ok but the point was HE AGREED TO IT. lol if he didn't have any places to go he should have said so.", "I live in the middle of nowhere. I can find a place to be if I have said that I won\u2019t be there.", "chiming in as additional person from butt-fuck-nowhere\n\nthat's when you take walk or find a walmart", "Then go for a walk and enjoy the no where", "Okay then you probably wouldn\u2019t agree to let your roommate have the place to himself in the first place. OP agreed to be anywhere else at a specific time and failed to let the roommate know when he couldn\u2019t.", "Also, the parks near me close at dark. Not so bad in June, but that's pretty early even this time of year.", "He wasn't laughing about it, the girlfriend was", "Here's a comment from OP:\n\n\"I mean I wouldn't go that far but she is way too good for him\"\n\nDoes that change your opinion?", "Scarce 100% means \u2018don\u2019t be home\u2019, there\u2019s zero doubt about that. And in any case OP agreed and reading their story they clearly knew the idea was for them not to be home and that they knew hiding in their room wasn\u2019t the idea.", "As much as I like the smell of weed ... dude, no, that's not it.", "How do you not get from the story that everything would have been fine if he'd stayed in his room? No complaints from the roommate when he stayed home, when a joint was lit up, or even when he went into the kitchen. But when finally it all added up into something that could not be ignored, then there was a complaint.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more roomie seems right - OP is jealous, and subconsciously or not, he wanted this date ruined.", "So why didn\u2019t they inform the room mate they weren\u2019t able to honor their promise? It\u2019s the saying one thing and doing another and not even informing the person you made the promise to that you had to renege and trying and failing to be sneaky about breaking the promise.\n\nAnd then skunking up the place on top of everything else and then making noise looking for food\u2026come on. OP comes across as the most generic unreliable stoner stereotype ever. To the point where I hope this whole story is made up.", "You are dramatic...\"wandering around outside alone for hours at night\"...Buddy should have been a good roommate and said \"hey my plans fell through ill be in my room for the night\". Yes, he pays rent and is legally allowed to be in his apartment whenever he wants. He is also an asshole in this situation. So shut up.", "I didn't see anywhere where he felt coerced into it or really didn't want to and was unenthusiastic about it.  \n\nTo me, agreeing to do something is a promise.  No magic words, no pinky swears - that's childish.  It's that old cliche that your word is your bond, and I expect that from other people too.", "I\u2019m not the only commenter to have said that.", "This is a key point. The time to assert rights to shared spaces is when the roommate asked him to have the place. Once you agree to be gone, unless your word means nothing, you stay gone. And you don\u2019t get so baked you can\u2019t safely grab a snack", ">Ok but the point was HE AGREED TO IT.\n\nWho cares?! It's not a legally binding agreement ffs. It was a casual request and circumstances changed. The GF wasn't even upset and OP apologized and frankly the BF being so mad about it is a HUGE red flag. BF needs to grow the hell up and not throw a tantrum when things don't go his way.", "Yeah the roommate is still in the wrong but like, there are a lot of places in the country where you can\u2019t really just like go somewhere at night. \n\nThe roommate could\u2019ve sat in his car at a park somewhere I guess to honor the agreement but acting like there\u2019s just a plethora of nighttime activities everywhere is wrong", "Agreed! I also live in the middle of nowhere and our mall is open to 9, one of the anchor stores is open later til 10, and the movie theater begins playing their last showings around 10:30. And just about every nowhere town has a dying mall close by. \n\nBut even besides that point if you know something is important to someone and they are asking you to do something for them one time, you find a way to do it.  Now if he asks you to be scarce all the time then it will be a problem but if it is a one off then you find a way to be gone.", "Very insensitive of you not to consider that OP and his roommate may live in the Arctic tundra and he will literally die if he leaves the house for four hours", "If you have a walmart, you ain't in the middle of bum fuck nowhere!!! I grew up in bum fuck, where the closest walmart is 3+ hours away! Lol", "Damn that\u2019s lame. Seems like his flatmate has a point saying he\u2019s jealous. What a dick.", "Yeah, he accidentally on purpose ruined it. He even said in a comment that he has picked up his roommate's date as she was leaving before. He was hoping to pick up Lisa too. I bet OP \"accidentally\" ruins a lot of things for his roomie.", "I mean I wouldn't go that far but she is way too good for him", "I mean I don't think OP was enthusiastic about staying out of the apartment. \nTo me agreeing to do something doesn't equal a promise. You're right, if you say something I expect you to do it but a promise is still something different to me. \nAnd it's also childish to be angry about something like this, especially since the girlfriend seemed to think it's funny and had no issue.\nCould've OP handled this better? Definitely. But to me people are overreacting.", "He said he wouldn't be there. Yeah I guess it's totally cool to not mean what you say lol.", "This is not a subreddit about legally binding verbal agreements. \n\nThis is a subreddit to determine if someone is an asshole. \n\nOP is an asshole.\n\n(Edit typos)", "You're middle of nowhere has a mall AND a movie theater?! Wow must be nice..... my middle of nowhere has a small convenience store that closes by 9", "I think your town sounds a little big, but most towns have a gas station or convenience store that stays open late.  Most have some kinda hangout place, even if it was like my hometown where people would park their cars or sit in the parking lot of the cafe after it closed for the night.", "\ud83d\ude06", "Same, I grew up in a super small town. Nearest Walmart, ANY fast food, any kind of a cafe, mall, grocery store, or general place acceptable for loitering was a 45min drive away. Don't have a car? Well that's too bad bud.", "Then go for a drive. You live that far away from EVERYTHING you probably have a car (because mass transit in small towns is nonexistent).", "Also from middle of nowhere, 50mins away from bum fuck nowhere (also known to locals as bum fuck) which is nearest place to us. It seems like our total population of 3 all have multiple reddit accounts each!\nCan confirm, the nearest wallmart is 3+ hrs away. There is only one house where all 3 residents and a cat live surrounded by desert. I have to go to the nearest tree - 20mins away to get Internet signal.", "And there it is, lol. Yta.", "Lol you are so jealous and just can\u2019t bring yourself to admit it. Stop trying to ruin your roommates relationship because you have a little crush. \n\nI\u2019m certain she\u2019s too good for you, too.", "So, you dropped the jar of spaghetti sauce on purpose, didn't you?", "Your opinion about their relationship is not relevant. It does sound like you wanted to ruin his date with your stoner bs.", "Ahahahahahahahahahahaha", "Yeah, the middle of nowhere town I grew up in had no mall, no movie theatre, and everything closed pretty early in the fall and winter.  I guess the town was safe enough I could wander the streets for hours, at least.", "I think it also depends on what you consider 'close by'. My middle of nowhere town has a slightly bigger town about a half hour away with a mall, a movie theater, a bowling alley, and a smattering of big-box stores and chain restaurants. If I had access to a car and enough gas money, I would totally go there to kill some time if I had already agreed to be out of the house.", "My middle of nowhere has 2 gas stations and a Family Dollar. I'm pretty lucky because 1 gas station is open 24 hours. The nearest mall is about 45 minutes away.", "I wouldn't want to \"go for a drive\" in the dark during the beginning of deer season. Have already hit 2 deer in my life and don't care to take the time and energy to make repairs..... or find a new car.", "Yuuuuuuuuuuuup. Everything about this post screamed loser until he screamed it himself.", "I also live in an area with a very high deer population (I see one almost every other day when I go into work), only ever been in one incident with them. Dad and FIL drove for a living all their lives and never hit one. Seems like being careful, keeping your eyes open, and paying attention keeps from hitting animals. \n\nStill, if you promised you'd be out of the house \"it's deer season!\" isn't an excuse to stay in. \n\nPlus, we don't even know if OP lives in an area with a lot of deer. For all we know he lives in the Tampa metro area.", "\"I'm not jealous of him\"\n\n\n*\"but his girlfriend is too good for him!\"* \n\nLol what a chode."]}
