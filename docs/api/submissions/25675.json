My mom always called him \u201cher little angel\u201d since he was always her favorite. To get straight to the story, I (15f) haven\u2019t had a birthday party in about 5 years, while my little brother (who\u2019s now 10) has always had one each year. My uncle (we\u2019ll call him bob for privacy reasons) started questioning why my little brother has always had a birthday party and I didn\u2019t, well she wasn\u2019t planning on celebrating my 15th birthday anyway. But when my uncle (bob) started telling the rest of my family rumors started going around and since she didn\u2019t want to sound like a \u201cbad mom\u201d she decided to let me have a birthday party. We were hosting it at a local playground near where I live. 3 of my friends and some of my family was invited and came. All day my brother has made up lies to get attention from people, and when me and my 3 friends were on the swings my mom made me get off so my brother could swing. (There was another set of swings right next to the one I was on) while most my birthday my brother got all the attention, it was finally time to sing and have cake. While everyone was gathering around my brother started crying and screaming because he wasn\u2019t going to be able to blow the candles out, so my mom told me to let him blow the candles out and then she\u2019ll relight them for me to blow out after. I was getting fed up with all this so when everyone was getting to the end of my birthday song I kind of moved my brother away and blew my own candles out. My brother was not happy about that. He started screaming and crying. My mom got really mad at me and she scolded me for not letting my brother blow the candles out. The rest of the family agreed on my part. My aunt and uncle started yelling at my mom for treating my brother way better than me. The rest of the family just started leaving in shame of my mom. After we got home my mom just kind of sat in her room in silence while my brother played his brand new ps5.

She's the asshole here, not you.", "NTA not even a little bit. I know that 3 years feels like a century at your age when you're dealing with things that have pretty much ruined your childhood. But I would like you to look far into the future. \n\nStart looking into every single scholarship available to you. Even the tiny ones add up. If your uncle can help, great. But be ready to launch at 18 with jobs and financial assistance to get a great education. \n\nTake comfort in the fact that the girl your brother marries is going to bear the brunt of your mother's nuttiness for much longer than you need to.

On the offchance it's real, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Talk to your aunt and uncle about moving in with them and then talk to CPS or a lawyer.", "NTA.

I had a brother 12 years younger than me and it was exactly the same way. He got everything he wanted, could do what he wanted, and if I ever told him otherwise, I'd get in trouble. My parents were super controlling with me and somewhat with my other brother (4 years younger), but never the youngest. I could go on for hours about it honestly, and there was much more to the issue than just blatant favoritism, but I will just say this: The best thing I ever did was cut that whole branch out of my family tree. Rotten to the core, the whole bunch. I haven't spoken to any family in nearly ten years. If you can get out early, do it. 3 more years otherwise, and make sure any adult who truly cares about you knows the details.", "Do you and your brother secretly have different fathers or something?

I'm going to assume (and if I'm wrong, I apologize) that having your 15th birthday at a playground was't your choice/preference either.

You mentioned your brothers brand new PS5.  What gift did you get for your birthday, or was your brother the one that got a gift for that too?", "NTA by a long shot, what you're describing is neglect. Talk to your other family members and see if there's someone you can move in with, then do it. You know your mom, if family picked you up and you moved in with them while she was out would she fight it? If so, look into what you need to do to get emancipated or get yourself removed from the house--do your research and don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure CPS will place you with family if there's someone willing and able to take you in. \nWhether you move out or not, if you're planning on applying for student loans and going to college, if your mom makes any amount of money make sure that her finances won't be taken into account. That might require emancipation? Honestly I don't know how to do it, I just know it's a thing. Maybe talk to your school's guidance counselor.

Hopefully a relative can give you a place to stay as i suspect you are a very independent person as you\u2019ve had to be to survive that treatment.\nSecond, get therapy, if you are an american i know its harder considering the cost but if possible, put the money into it as you will likely suffer by not being able to trust anyone too much and have a low self esteem as you are not worth anything as that is the impression your mom are raising you with. You should not wait too long with this as you do NOT deserve living with the horrible impression your mom has given you.\n\nI know this might seem harsh, and most of all\u2026 scary\u2026 but if you have survived that treatment for this long\u2026 there is not much out there that will be able to break you as it takes a fkin strong character to survive what you have survived. \n\n\nThis is not normal.\n\nYou should not accept this as normal.\n\nThis is not what you deserve.\n\nDont stay to save your mom from feeling any pain or inconvenience.\n\nYou do NOT owe her anything.\n\nPlease\u2026 consider what i have writte  even if its a long text.\n\nDont wait for \u201dthe last straw\u201d until you tale action, its not gonna come i the way you are waiting or hoping for. it will continue until you stop it.\n\nYou do not owe your mom an explaination either for leaving so dont bother thinking of what to tell her.\n\n\nTake care my friend, you deserve better no matter the circumstances.", "INFO: I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve read this exact post before.
