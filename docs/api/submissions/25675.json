My mom always called him \u201cher little angel\u201d since he was always her favorite. To get straight to the story, I (15f) haven\u2019t had a birthday party in about 5 years, while my little brother (who\u2019s now 10) has always had one each year. My uncle (we\u2019ll call him bob for privacy reasons) started questioning why my little brother has always had a birthday party and I didn\u2019t, well she wasn\u2019t planning on celebrating my 15th birthday anyway. But when my uncle (bob) started telling the rest of my family rumors started going around and since she didn\u2019t want to sound like a \u201cbad mom\u201d she decided to let me have a birthday party. We were hosting it at a local playground near where I live. 3 of my friends and some of my family was invited and came. All day my brother has made up lies to get attention from people, and when me and my 3 friends were on the swings my mom made me get off so my brother could swing. (There was another set of swings right next to the one I was on) while most my birthday my brother got all the attention, it was finally time to sing and have cake. While everyone was gathering around my brother started crying and screaming because he wasn\u2019t going to be able to blow the candles out, so my mom told me to let him blow the candles out and then she\u2019ll relight them for me to blow out after. I was getting fed up with all this so when everyone was getting to the end of my birthday song I kind of moved my brother away and blew my own candles out. My brother was not happy about that. He started screaming and crying. My mom got really mad at me and she scolded me for not letting my brother blow the candles out. The rest of the family agreed on my part. My aunt and uncle started yelling at my mom for treating my brother way better than me. The rest of the family just started leaving in shame of my mom. After we got home my mom just kind of sat in her room in silence while my brother played his brand new ps5.

Can you go stay with your uncle?  NTA.\n\nAnd happy birthday.  You deserve so much more!!", "Hugs my friend.", "Check state laws. Depending on the age you may be able to decide. Tell her that if she doesn't let you then you will report her for neglect and abuse. She backed down quick when your family started yelling about your party. Get them involved and have them back you. She will let you to save face.", "Exactly the case.", "Omg your brother is Dudley Dursley.", "NTA \n\nI'm glad the family got to see her behavior and your spoiled brother's as well. She's the asshole here, not you.", "NTA not even a little bit. I know that 3 years feels like a century at your age when you're dealing with things that have pretty much ruined your childhood. But I would like you to look far into the future. \n\nStart looking into every single scholarship available to you. Even the tiny ones add up. If your uncle can help, great. But be ready to launch at 18 with jobs and financial assistance to get a great education. \n\nTake comfort in the fact that the girl your brother marries is going to bear the brunt of your mother's nuttiness for much longer than you need to. Your freedom is just around the next turn.", "NTA. Your birthday should be about you not your little brother. \nHappy birthday!!!", "NTA\n\nYour mom is a Godzilla sized AH for pulling shit like that on your Bday. Hope she enjoys the LC she will get once you pick and head out when your old enough.", "NTA\nI can see in years to come, your mom asking why you and her don't have a relationship. Your mom has chosen, go with that. Wish her well with her choice.", "It\u2019s kinda wild that blowing out candles endures as a tradition despite living in an era of deadly airborne pathogens", "This is too over the top to believable. On the offchance it's real, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Talk to your aunt and uncle about moving in with them and then talk to CPS or a lawyer.", "NTA. Your mom on the other hand sounds like major AH. Sucks you had this happen on your birthday and she didn\u2019t even get you a gift? Sorry. You deserve better treatment.", "The one in which op was the brother and her sister was spoiled ?", "Can you move out to live with other family?", "You could ask your uncle to help you get emancipated.", "Sadly it\u2019s kind of a common issue\u2026 I can personally tell stories of how ALL my siblings got to go to the Caribbean but I wasn\u2019t invited, or how they all got cars when they graduated and I got a pen set\u2026 family\u2019s are fun", "Were you really surprised that OP didn't get anything from their mom, while the brother got a ps5?  I would have been shocked speechless if she had gotten anything.  Even getting a birthday party, with cake, was more than mom was willing to do.", "Ugh I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. I had a brother 12 years younger than me and it was exactly the same way. He got everything he wanted, could do what he wanted, and if I ever told him otherwise, I'd get in trouble. My parents were super controlling with me and somewhat with my other brother (4 years younger), but never the youngest. I could go on for hours about it honestly, and there was much more to the issue than just blatant favoritism, but I will just say this: The best thing I ever did was cut that whole branch out of my family tree. Rotten to the core, the whole bunch. I haven't spoken to any family in nearly ten years. If you can get out early, do it. 3 more years otherwise, and make sure any adult who truly cares about you knows the details.", "Do you and your brother secretly have different fathers or something? I just don't understand where this level of deliberate and malicious favoritism is coming from.", "NTA. I'm going to assume (and if I'm wrong, I apologize) that having your 15th birthday at a playground was't your choice/preference either. I assume that because a playground  sounds like the perfect place to throw a party for a 10-year-old. \n\nI'm sorry your mom is like this. You deserve her love and attention too.", "NTA 10 is too old to have a tantrum over someone else blowing out their own candles on their own birthday cake.", "Nta \nI'm going to teach my kids that they can only blow out their birthday candles and they can't do it on other people birthdays", "NTA luckily you have only three more years with them and you can start planning your freedom. I started collecting dishes and curtains for my future home when still living with my parents. People knew about the box so I got things like frying pan as gifts.", "NTA.  You mentioned your brothers brand new PS5.  What gift did you get for your birthday, or was your brother the one that got a gift for that too?", "NTA by a long shot, what you're describing is neglect. Talk to your other family members and see if there's someone you can move in with, then do it. You know your mom, if family picked you up and you moved in with them while she was out would she fight it? If so, look into what you need to do to get emancipated or get yourself removed from the house--do your research and don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure CPS will place you with family if there's someone willing and able to take you in. \nWhether you move out or not, if you're planning on applying for student loans and going to college, if your mom makes any amount of money make sure that her finances won't be taken into account. That might require emancipation? Honestly I don't know how to do it, I just know it's a thing. Maybe talk to your school's guidance counselor. Reddit, anyone have more info than me?", "Happy birthday, love! \ud83c\udf82 You are 100% NTA.", "Never given out a more obvious NTA \u2014 everyone is entitled to blow out their own candles and your brother should have been raised better", "One of these days you're going to turn 18 and that woman is never going to see you again I mean the nerve of her to just openly favor a 10-year-old that acts like he's three selfish and immature for 10-year-old.

My kid will be 15 and I haven't served her slobber to anyone. LOL", "As most parents do.
