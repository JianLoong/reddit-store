My mom always called him \u201cher little angel\u201d since he was always her favorite. To get straight to the story, I (15f) haven\u2019t had a birthday party in about 5 years, while my little brother (who\u2019s now 10) has always had one each year. My uncle (we\u2019ll call him bob for privacy reasons) started questioning why my little brother has always had a birthday party and I didn\u2019t, well she wasn\u2019t planning on celebrating my 15th birthday anyway. But when my uncle (bob) started telling the rest of my family rumors started going around and since she didn\u2019t want to sound like a \u201cbad mom\u201d she decided to let me have a birthday party. We were hosting it at a local playground near where I live. 3 of my friends and some of my family was invited and came. All day my brother has made up lies to get attention from people, and when me and my 3 friends were on the swings my mom made me get off so my brother could swing. (There was another set of swings right next to the one I was on) while most my birthday my brother got all the attention, it was finally time to sing and have cake. While everyone was gathering around my brother started crying and screaming because he wasn\u2019t going to be able to blow the candles out, so my mom told me to let him blow the candles out and then she\u2019ll relight them for me to blow out after. I was getting fed up with all this so when everyone was getting to the end of my birthday song I kind of moved my brother away and blew my own candles out. My brother was not happy about that. He started screaming and crying. My mom got really mad at me and she scolded me for not letting my brother blow the candles out. The rest of the family agreed on my part. My aunt and uncle started yelling at my mom for treating my brother way better than me. The rest of the family just started leaving in shame of my mom. After we got home my mom just kind of sat in her room in silence while my brother played his brand new ps5.
