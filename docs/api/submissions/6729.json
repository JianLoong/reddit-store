It didn't work out but we parted on friendly enough terms. A few months later I hear through a mutual friend that she's pregnant and I call her to ask if that baby's mine. She ignored my calls so I went round her house (we both did uni in our home city) and her Mum told me she wasn't interested in seeing me and it wasn't my business. So I left and didn't go round again. \n\nI thought the baby was probably mine (though couldn't be sure obviously) so I went to a solicitor in town and asked what I could do and they told me I had to wait until the baby was born.  Fast forward a few months and I hear she had the baby so I go back to the solicitor and they go to court for me to ask for declarator that I'm the father, parental rights and responsibilities and contact with the baby. I wanted some residence too, like two nights a week or something, but the solicitor told me I probably wouldn't get that while the mum was breastfeeding and that seemed fair enough to me. \n\nAmy never contested anything I asked for in court so I got it all and I started going round her house with my Mum to see the baby. He's such a cool wee guy. His mum named him without asking me before I got my PRRs which I'm a bit upset about but nothing I can do about it. Amy's been mostly OK with me but her Mum is always really cold and a bit difficult. \n\nA couple of weeks ago Amy told me she was moving to take a new job and taking the baby with her. The job is a really exciting position at a financial firm in the capital city and probably not the sort of opportunity she'd have here. The capital is not too far away, 40 mins on the train, but I was unhappy that I would have to travel further for contact. Amy wasn't interested in talking about it and said she was the main parent and I would just have to make it work. \n\nI was really upset so I went back to my solicitor and they have asked for a specific issue order to stop the baby's address from being moved out of my city. The court won't decide for another couple of weeks but I got a call from Amy's Mum saying I was selfishly trying to ruin Amy's future and she should be able to make the decision because she gave birth and if I wanted a say I should have married her before knocking her up. \n\nAITA for going to court and interfering with Amy's future?\n\nEdit to address some recurring points: \n\nI didn't get a DNA test. I asked the court for declarator that was the father and they served the papers on Amy and she decided not to participate in the court process. I gave evidence about our relationship and my interactions with Amy since then. Amy herself has never denied that I'm the father, her position was just that it was none of my business. I feel like folk are concentrating on this and trying to make out that I'm pushing some kind of lie when it's not something that's actually in doubt. \n\nI am not seeking a relationship with Amy or trying to reinsert myself in her life or control her. All I want is to be a co parent with her. I don't really understand the comments saying she doesn't want a relationship with me therefore I shouldn't have tried to be involved in my kids life? \n\nI get that it's not a great distance especially compared to some American cities and I get that it might look I'm just interested in my convenience but I'm really worried that if the trains are on strike or I miss a train or whatever and it impedes my contact then I will look bad when I ask to have residential time with the baby. I am hoping to eventually be an equal parent and I'm scared that is in danger. \n\nI've been knocked a bit by all the negative responses so I'm going to think again about what the best solution might be.", "created_utc": 1673111516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105u1za/aita_for_stopping_the_mother_of_my_child_from/", "score": 2715, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had sole legal/sole physical of my kiddo so nothing to worry about. He had shared custody with his ex having primary. Kiddo and her mom lived 25 minutes away. When she was 6, her mom got remarried and they moved 35 minutes away. After a couple of months, that marriage ended, so her mom moved back in with family 25 minutes away. \n\nWhen she was in 5th grade, her mom met/married someone new. They moved an hour away. We drove 1 hour each way every Wednesday evening to exercise custody time with kiddo and drove her back home - basically her dad would pick her up at school or if he was working later, my work was halfway between her home and our home, so I would drive 30 min north/1 hour south at 4:30 in the afternoon. We\u2019d have dinner as a family, help her with her homework and at 7:30 or so drive her home. This continued until Mom/husband separated at the end of her 8th grade year. \n\nShe started high school a mile from our house and split her time between her mom and dad\u2019s because she and mom moved back in with family 25 minutes away. Sophomore year through college she lives here.

As a single mother I would be livid if their father tried to stop me from going only 40 minutes away for a better financial opportunity.

It didn't work out but we parted on friendly enough terms. A few months later I hear through a mutual friend that she's pregnant and I call her to ask if that baby's mine. She ignored my calls so I went round her house (we both did uni in our home city) and her Mum told me she wasn't interested in seeing me and it wasn't my business. So I left and didn't go round again. \n\nI thought the baby was probably mine (though couldn't be sure obviously) so I went to a solicitor in town and asked what I could do and they told me I had to wait until the baby was born.  Fast forward a few months and I hear she had the baby so I go back to the solicitor and they go to court for me to ask for declarator that I'm the father, parental rights and responsibilities and contact with the baby. I wanted some residence too, like two nights a week or something, but the solicitor told me I probably wouldn't get that while the mum was breastfeeding and that seemed fair enough to me. \n\nAmy never contested anything I asked for in court so I got it all and I started going round her house with my Mum to see the baby. He's such a cool wee guy. His mum named him without asking me before I got my PRRs which I'm a bit upset about but nothing I can do about it. Amy's been mostly OK with me but her Mum is always really cold and a bit difficult. \n\nA couple of weeks ago Amy told me she was moving to take a new job and taking the baby with her. The job is a really exciting position at a financial firm in the capital city and probably not the sort of opportunity she'd have here. The capital is not too far away, 40 mins on the train, but I was unhappy that I would have to travel further for contact. Amy wasn't interested in talking about it and said she was the main parent and I would just have to make it work. \n\nI was really upset so I went back to my solicitor and they have asked for a specific issue order to stop the baby's address from being moved out of my city. The court won't decide for another couple of weeks but I got a call from Amy's Mum saying I was selfishly trying to ruin Amy's future and she should be able to make the decision because she gave birth and if I wanted a say I should have married her before knocking her up. \n\nAITA for going to court and interfering with Amy's future?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She and your son could have a vastly better quality of life if she takes this job. By taking her to court, you might also make the co-parenting situation extremely difficult, and will have to deal with it for at least 18 years. \n\nHave you considered moving to the city instead, or moving halfway, or in the same school district? Are her long-term plans to stay there forever? She moves, but there is a decrease in child support because of increased travel expenses? You get more time at school vacations and summer?

Why did she just accept him as the father but won't let him take a paternity test?", "I am sooo glad that I am not the only one who is creeped out by OP. Honestly I think every man should step up and take care of their kid but OP didn\u2019t even bother to get a DNA test? Something doesn\u2019t seem right.", "If you don't respond to court summons generally they believe the other side. All Amy had to say is he isn't the father and here would have been a DNA test done.", "I think he\u2019s sure it\u2019s his because he was so controlling of her free time. Sounds like she had a lot going on with school and work.", "I used to drive over 40 minutes one-way to work daily and considered that CLOSE.\n\nI mean, I get the UK is a lot smaller than where I'm from, but FFS? He's spitefully trying to ruin a woman- a woman he believes is the other half of his child- because he's too lazy to occasionally make a trip that is a very realistic daily commute for most people? C'mon. He's being spiteful", "Yeah, op you have to think \"what is best for my kid\" not \"what is best for my court case\".\n\nBest for kid is mom financially secure in a good career. 40 minutes to a place with more opportunity for your child as well as the lil guys mom should be easy if it's your kid you care about and not just yourself.", "And over those 40 minutes, OP will create progressively challenging hurdles in his child's life (mother won't be as well employed, won't have the daily conveniences available for her child, such as playdates and sports teams, etc.)  Mother's life is going to worse and it's going to trickle down to the child because she's only got 24 hours of bandwidth.\n\nChild will suffer and mom will suffer and this is why single moms get a bad rap.\n\nBut guess what?

I live in a densely populated, tiny country, and even I think 40 minutes is a breeze.  My everyday commute is a bit more than 40 minutes each way, I just read a book on the train. It's kind of great, actually.", "It isn't necessarily nefarious, maybe she just didn't want the hassle of trying to coparent.", "He says there was no DNA, just a declaration of the court that he claims to be the father.  This all sounds very dodgy.", ">Also why didn't Amy want to see him? Why did he have to go to a solicitor just to get a DNA test? \n\nBecause she panicked at the thought of having to co-parent with someone she's not involved with.  She doesn't want to deal with the logistics and/or emotions of not having her child with her every day.  What's happening - not being able to make the move because her co-parent won't let her - is probably also exactly one of the things she was afraid of.", "He didn\u2019t even get a DNA test!", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think he can understand how annoying and exhausting he is.

Ruin my career over stupidity and I will play stupid.", "Yeah, that point was not explicit.  I am assuming that somehow paternity was determined, because otherwise the whole narrative of being successful at stopping the move doesn't make sense to me (but I'm in the US, and OP apparently is not).  But if I'm wrong then I agree with you.", "Yeah unless we a missing some info I am not even sure this is ops kid", "Seems likely", "> Amy not contesting it means she thinks he is the father too.

And that he would sabotage her to save himself a commute most of us take twice a day.", "I think this. He immediately assumed it was his. Like what about her other partners? And why so sure if using protection?\n\nI think he sabotaged the condom\n\nCuz no one immediately assumes its his kid if a condom was used and hunts down the woman, physically then legally to get her to reveal its his baby.", "I thought this too.. he made it a point to say they always used protection, but immediately thought the baby was his and went to a solicitor. Like, he has certainty it is his child, and still hasn\u2019t done a DNA test (not sure how old the baby is, but it\u2019s a simple test). Seems very odd, big red flag.", "She may be afraid of him. So many women have been hurt or killed for saying no to men.", "Depending on when he filed and how quickly he got his hearing, what state Amy was in after birth with physical and sleep related difficulties and her finances for a solicitor there could be a few reasons she didn't respond.", "> 100 miles is a long way.\n\nAlso to Rhode Islanders.", "I\u2019m a Brit but 40 minutes on a train is considered a really short commute and is about average to how long I\u2019d travel to meet a buddy at the pub, let alone see my child.", "American, so I guess my judgement of distance is different than the British folks.

I used to spend 40 minutes in metro and bus just to get to work, no big deal in Europe. This guy is just drama.", "Bingo.  He didn\u2019t want a paternity test, he just wanted to impose himself on this woman and her child.", "Makes you low key wonder if that's why Amy hid her pregnancy and is also trying to move.

What if her boss was an asshole and threatened to fire her if she couldn't get off work? What if OP filed in a court that was too far away for her to get to in time?
