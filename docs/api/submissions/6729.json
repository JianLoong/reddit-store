It didn't work out but we parted on friendly enough terms. A few months later I hear through a mutual friend that she's pregnant and I call her to ask if that baby's mine. She ignored my calls so I went round her house (we both did uni in our home city) and her Mum told me she wasn't interested in seeing me and it wasn't my business. So I left and didn't go round again. \n\nI thought the baby was probably mine (though couldn't be sure obviously) so I went to a solicitor in town and asked what I could do and they told me I had to wait until the baby was born.  Fast forward a few months and I hear she had the baby so I go back to the solicitor and they go to court for me to ask for declarator that I'm the father, parental rights and responsibilities and contact with the baby. I wanted some residence too, like two nights a week or something, but the solicitor told me I probably wouldn't get that while the mum was breastfeeding and that seemed fair enough to me. \n\nAmy never contested anything I asked for in court so I got it all and I started going round her house with my Mum to see the baby. He's such a cool wee guy. His mum named him without asking me before I got my PRRs which I'm a bit upset about but nothing I can do about it. Amy's been mostly OK with me but her Mum is always really cold and a bit difficult. \n\nA couple of weeks ago Amy told me she was moving to take a new job and taking the baby with her. The job is a really exciting position at a financial firm in the capital city and probably not the sort of opportunity she'd have here. The capital is not too far away, 40 mins on the train, but I was unhappy that I would have to travel further for contact. Amy wasn't interested in talking about it and said she was the main parent and I would just have to make it work. \n\nI was really upset so I went back to my solicitor and they have asked for a specific issue order to stop the baby's address from being moved out of my city. The court won't decide for another couple of weeks but I got a call from Amy's Mum saying I was selfishly trying to ruin Amy's future and she should be able to make the decision because she gave birth and if I wanted a say I should have married her before knocking her up. \n\nAITA for going to court and interfering with Amy's future?\n\nEdit to address some recurring points: \n\nI didn't get a DNA test. I asked the court for declarator that was the father and they served the papers on Amy and she decided not to participate in the court process. I gave evidence about our relationship and my interactions with Amy since then. Amy herself has never denied that I'm the father, her position was just that it was none of my business. I feel like folk are concentrating on this and trying to make out that I'm pushing some kind of lie when it's not something that's actually in doubt. \n\nI am not seeking a relationship with Amy or trying to reinsert myself in her life or control her. All I want is to be a co parent with her. I don't really understand the comments saying she doesn't want a relationship with me therefore I shouldn't have tried to be involved in my kids life? \n\nI get that it's not a great distance especially compared to some American cities and I get that it might look I'm just interested in my convenience but I'm really worried that if the trains are on strike or I miss a train or whatever and it impedes my contact then I will look bad when I ask to have residential time with the baby. I am hoping to eventually be an equal parent and I'm scared that is in danger. \n\nI've been knocked a bit by all the negative responses so I'm going to think again about what the best solution might be.", "created_utc": 1673111516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105u1za/aita_for_stopping_the_mother_of_my_child_from/", "score": 532, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had sole legal/sole physical of my kiddo so nothing to worry about. He had shared custody with his ex having primary. Kiddo and her mom lived 25 minutes away. When she was 6, her mom got remarried and they moved 35 minutes away. After a couple of months, that marriage ended, so her mom moved back in with family 25 minutes away. \n\nWhen she was in 5th grade, her mom met/married someone new. They moved an hour away. We drove 1 hour each way every Wednesday evening to exercise custody time with kiddo and drove her back home - basically her dad would pick her up at school or if he was working later, my work was halfway between her home and our home, so I would drive 30 min north/1 hour south at 4:30 in the afternoon. We\u2019d have dinner as a family, help her with her homework and at 7:30 or so drive her home. This continued until Mom/husband separated at the end of her 8th grade year. \n\nShe started high school a mile from our house and split her time between her mom and dad\u2019s because she and mom moved back in with family 25 minutes away. Sophomore year through college she lives here.

As a single mother I would be livid if their father tried to stop me from going only 40 minutes away for a better financial opportunity.

It didn't work out but we parted on friendly enough terms. A few months later I hear through a mutual friend that she's pregnant and I call her to ask if that baby's mine. She ignored my calls so I went round her house (we both did uni in our home city) and her Mum told me she wasn't interested in seeing me and it wasn't my business. So I left and didn't go round again. \n\nI thought the baby was probably mine (though couldn't be sure obviously) so I went to a solicitor in town and asked what I could do and they told me I had to wait until the baby was born.  Fast forward a few months and I hear she had the baby so I go back to the solicitor and they go to court for me to ask for declarator that I'm the father, parental rights and responsibilities and contact with the baby. I wanted some residence too, like two nights a week or something, but the solicitor told me I probably wouldn't get that while the mum was breastfeeding and that seemed fair enough to me. \n\nAmy never contested anything I asked for in court so I got it all and I started going round her house with my Mum to see the baby. He's such a cool wee guy. His mum named him without asking me before I got my PRRs which I'm a bit upset about but nothing I can do about it. Amy's been mostly OK with me but her Mum is always really cold and a bit difficult. \n\nA couple of weeks ago Amy told me she was moving to take a new job and taking the baby with her. The job is a really exciting position at a financial firm in the capital city and probably not the sort of opportunity she'd have here. The capital is not too far away, 40 mins on the train, but I was unhappy that I would have to travel further for contact. Amy wasn't interested in talking about it and said she was the main parent and I would just have to make it work. \n\nI was really upset so I went back to my solicitor and they have asked for a specific issue order to stop the baby's address from being moved out of my city. The court won't decide for another couple of weeks but I got a call from Amy's Mum saying I was selfishly trying to ruin Amy's future and she should be able to make the decision because she gave birth and if I wanted a say I should have married her before knocking her up. \n\nAITA for going to court and interfering with Amy's future?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She and your son could have a vastly better quality of life if she takes this job. By taking her to court, you might also make the co-parenting situation extremely difficult, and will have to deal with it for at least 18 years. \n\nHave you considered moving to the city instead, or moving halfway, or in the same school district? Are her long-term plans to stay there forever? She moves, but there is a decrease in child support because of increased travel expenses? You get more time at school vacations and summer?

It could be, that instead they'll reorganise the visitation schedule.", "He can\u2019t push too hard because he doesn\u2019t know if he is really the father (he won\u2019t get a paternity test).\n\nThis is not about the kid, this is about controlling Amy.", "Yeah I should maybe revisit that with my solicitor.", "In his comments he says he \u201cpays what he can\u201d for child support.

Feel like that should be more of a priority right now.", "Correct. When coparenting you have to have conversations. Not unilateral decisions if it involves the kid. They both were doing what was best for them individually. But they need to learn the art of coparenting.", "It\u2019s about more than that though. She made unilateral decisions to move albeit within a semi-normal distance and essentially told him that she gets to call the shots. He\u2019s the kid\u2019s dad (allegedly).

Maybe if you make it impossible for her to leave, she\u2019ll be forced to be with you.", "You don\u2019t have to accept it. It\u2019s what\u2019s happening.

What have you given Amy, what has she reasonably taken from you? As you said, she didnt contest your claims, which sounds fairly giving to me. What sacrifice have you made for her benefit or comfort?

While there are a lot more supports here, having to use public transport every day adds up. When I was commuting to the city for work it was costing me over \u00a3260/month. Doing it a couple of times a month is fine, but she may actually be losing money taking the job if she doesn\u2019t move into the city. I\u2019m guess the job has a much better chance for upward mobility and pay rises than anything she can get in her local town though", "Why should she have to commute every day and take on extra childcare costs to cover the additional time when he could take the trip a few times a week to see his kid.", "The mother wants to move to Edinburgh, loads of people commute over an hour to get into the city and OP is whining about a 40 minute train journey.", "Why should she have to commute more, waste money on the commute and sacrifice time with her child just to suit him? Maybe she wants her child to grow up in a city? Edinburgh is a good place to bring up kids, lots of choices of schools and lots of green spaces to visit.", "Why should she have to compromise to make OP\u2019s life *slightly* more convenient?

I don\u2019t understand why everyone is acting like she wouldn\u2019t know who she was sleeping with when she got pregnant. Good chance there is only one possible candidate.

People come here for a judgment but you\u2019re getting mostly judged by children and we don\u2019t really know the whole story. It\u2019s a kid\u2019s life and a complicated relationship.
