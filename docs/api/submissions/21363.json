She'd always skimp out of grocery money, but always brought us to hair salons every time we'd go to any sortve event. She'd spend a pretty penny on our hair. And she'd take better care of our hair than our health. \n\nAnnabel started the tradition when she turned 16. To spite our mother she dyed her hair pink and cut it all into a short Bob. My mother was absolutely horrified. One after the other each 16th birthday my siblings died and cut their blonde beautiful hair to spite our mother. \n\nI'm the only one left with my long blonde hair.

And hair takes so long to grow!\n\nMaybe you could find your own way to honor your independence and just signal to your mom and siblings that you're keeping your hair but it's not for your mom, it's for you. My first thought is kind of silly, but you could tuck it all in a big, soft hat when you're around your mom, and insist you want to keep it on for comfort - it would add some complexity to styling in the morning, though. hmmm... Well, you would know better what kind of expression might be just the right level of spite for your taste. One other idea - make it symbolic. Dye a tiny section with temporary dye (so small that when the dye fades, it will be unnoticeable or you could just trim it). Cut a similar tiny section. Do something dramatic - put the hair somewhere your mom will see it and freak out, photo with caption \"the trap is set\" send to siblings, and tell them \"my hair is my own and it is one of the things I'm actually able to appreciate from my life. I am not going to cut it the same way you did, but I am in solidarity with you. I want mom to know that too. I am here standing with you, but please be considerate of my bodily autonomy and my personal choices \"\n\nBut regardless NTA! it's YOUR hair!", "NTA\n\nYour siblings will not soothe their own abuse by turning around and abusing their siblings.  Ask them if they'd like to actually spite her, or if they want to grow up to be just like her.  Because in this case, giving you your bodily autonomy and caring about your genuine wants are the best way to actually spite your abusive mother.  \n\nThey all got to protest in their own way.  Why are they trying to steal that choice from you now?", "NTA, it's your hair and you like it. If they want to do that to their hair, fine, they can do that.

Let them know if that if anyone tries to do anything to your hair, you will file charges.\n\nWhat's so bizarre here is that all your siblings have decided to abuse themselves to attack your mother. They all vandalized their own hair because their mother made them do it.  You're the only one who has a sense of self strong enough to not only survive your mother's shortcomings but to rise above them and do what you want for yourself.\n\nIf you do something to spite someone else, you are still being controlled by that someone else. At 16, you've matured way past your siblings. Tell them how petty and moronic they're being and that you won't sacrifice your hair on their alter to your mom's disfunction.  Ask if they've ever heard the phrase \"cut of your nose to spite your face.\"\n\nTell them you won't be controlled by them, and that they are acting just like their mother, demanding that you do what THEY want with YOUR hair.  Then go NC and tell them to call when they grow up.", "NTA. Oh my goodness, it's your hair. what a thing for them to take a stand on!

Hair seems to be very important for your whole family. I understand you love your hair and don\u2019t want to cut or dye it but haircuts and dyes are temporary. For them you are symbolically choosing to side with your mother which is more permanent than any hair cut or dye. Also I noticed you mentioned how much your mother loves your hair, spent time one it and favors you because of the color. You also mentioned you love the color of your hair. This bears the question do you love your hair because that\u2019s the only way your mother paid you any attention and affection and by cutting it you are afraid to lose the only form of affection from your mother? Are you okay with keeping your mom\u2019s affection to your hair and losing the trust you have with your siblings?", "NTA\n\nBut it sounds a little bit like a initiation ritual for a fraternity - and the problem is, if you are not doing the ritual, you can't get part of the group. Its a \"are you willing to sacrifice an important thing to show us you are willing to put the group above the individual\".  All of them were ready to do the sacrifice, so this is the base of their strong bond. So you not doing it feels for them like a betrayl and therefore they are turning their backs on you.\n\nThe point is, it doesn't matter if you or your siblings are AHs. A bunch of internet strangers telling you you are nta will not lead to your siblings speaking to you again or you getting into the \"club\". So i think knowing whos the asshole here will make you feel better, but it will not solve the problem with your siblings. I guess you can just hope they love you more than they hate mom and will come around sooner or later. You can try to argue with them, but unfortunately thats hard if they ice you out.", "I don't want to do that though :( I'm too scared, I'd rather wait till Annabel saves up enough to move out and move in with her", "Annabel lives at home, and we have no other family except my uncle, but Annabel makes us stay in our rooms when he comes over because she says he's evil and he'll be mean to us", "Yep, unfortunately whilst I agree with body autonomy, I do think the op needs to rethink cutting her hair purely to keep relations with her siblings. They seem to be her only allies and she risks losing them and being stuck with this abusive AH mother.", "Everytime they did it, they'd sneak out, and by the time my mom realized they were gone it was too late", "Exactly! I just think there\u2019s an opportunity here to remember what it\u2019s for. Obviously OPs choice but I would at minimum (personally) go with a symbolic gesture here"]}
