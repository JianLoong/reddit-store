This is quite the story, so I'll start from the beginning \n\nMy mother has 6 kids. Annabel (22f) Seth (20m) Lilly (19f) Melanie and stephanie (17f twins) and me, who's 16F.\n\nMy mother has never been a real parent to us. She popped out baby after baby, forcing my older siblings to take care of the next one. People even assumed that Annabel was my mother for a time because she'd always be seen grocery shopping.. Buying our uniforms and bringing us places.. My mother was busy enjoying her life. \n\nOur mother has cared about one and only one thing about us. Our hair. She loves our beautiful blonde hair. She'd always skimp out of grocery money, but always brought us to hair salons every time we'd go to any sortve event. She'd spend a pretty penny on our hair. And she'd take better care of our hair than our health. \n\nAnnabel started the tradition when she turned 16. To spite our mother she dyed her hair pink and cut it all into a short Bob. My mother was absolutely horrified. One after the other each 16th birthday my siblings died and cut their blonde beautiful hair to spite our mother. \n\nI'm the only one left with my long blonde hair. It's down to my legs and my mother adores it. She always favored my hair the most because it was the lightest blonde and \"it's just like a dolls hair!\" \n\nshe spent hours brushing it when i was a little girl. So I wasn't very surprised when all my siblings came to me a day after my birthday, eager to bring me to a salon and cut all my hair off and dye it. I told them I loved my long hair, and I loved the color. \n\nThey all got mad and told me that I needed to cut and dye it, or at the very least dye it, my mother loved it and they wanted to see her cry (she always cried when they cut their hair) \n\nI told them that I hated mom, she was horrible and toxic but it's my hair, and I love it. \n\nNone of them are speaking to me.. I understand their hateful nature, and why they want me to cut it, maybe I just should...

You get to choose what to do with your own body. None of this- from your mom or your siblings- is healthy. Do yourself a favor and find a therapist (school counselor maybe) you can talk to because it doesn\u2019t sound like you have many healthy people in your life.", "NTA. solidarity is important but bodily autonomy is more important.. nobody should ever tell you you need to cut your hair (you might voluntarily do so for a situation but it should be your decision!). also, it seems like you're not really fully behind your siblings' motives, so it would be disingenuous to do as they did and you would probably regret it. And hair takes so long to grow!\n\nMaybe you could find your own way to honor your independence and just signal to your mom and siblings that you're keeping your hair but it's not for your mom, it's for you. My first thought is kind of silly, but you could tuck it all in a big, soft hat when you're around your mom, and insist you want to keep it on for comfort - it would add some complexity to styling in the morning, though. hmmm... Well, you would know better what kind of expression might be just the right level of spite for your taste. One other idea - make it symbolic. Dye a tiny section with temporary dye (so small that when the dye fades, it will be unnoticeable or you could just trim it). Cut a similar tiny section. Do something dramatic - put the hair somewhere your mom will see it and freak out, photo with caption \"the trap is set\" send to siblings, and tell them \"my hair is my own and it is one of the things I'm actually able to appreciate from my life. I am not going to cut it the same way you did, but I am in solidarity with you. I want mom to know that too. I am here standing with you, but please be considerate of my bodily autonomy and my personal choices \"\n\nBut regardless NTA! it's YOUR hair!", "NTA\n\nYour siblings will not soothe their own abuse by turning around and abusing their siblings.  Ask them if they'd like to actually spite her, or if they want to grow up to be just like her.  Because in this case, giving you your bodily autonomy and caring about your genuine wants are the best way to actually spite your abusive mother.  \n\nThey all got to protest in their own way.  Why are they trying to steal that choice from you now?", "NTA, it's your hair and you like it. If they want to do that to their hair, fine, they can do that. What they can't do is tell you what to do with your hair.", "NTA.  Your siblings are a different kind of AH than your mother is but they are all AHs for insisting that you do something that you don't want to do just to spite your mother.", "NTA but your siblings are. \nLock your door at night when you sleep...", "NTA.  Your siblings sou d more like a prison gang than a family. If your bedroom doesn't have a lock, get one. Also, keep all your hair car products licked up. They will try to force you into this. Let them know if that if anyone tries to do anything to your hair, you will file charges.\n\nWhat's so bizarre here is that all your siblings have decided to abuse themselves to attack your mother. They all vandalized their own hair because their mother made them do it.  You're the only one who has a sense of self strong enough to not only survive your mother's shortcomings but to rise above them and do what you want for yourself.\n\nIf you do something to spite someone else, you are still being controlled by that someone else. At 16, you've matured way past your siblings. Tell them how petty and moronic they're being and that you won't sacrifice your hair on their alter to your mom's disfunction.  Ask if they've ever heard the phrase \"cut of your nose to spite your face.\"\n\nTell them you won't be controlled by them, and that they are acting just like their mother, demanding that you do what THEY want with YOUR hair.  Then go NC and tell them to call when they grow up.", "NTA. Oh my goodness, it's your hair. what a thing for them to take a stand on! Okay, so you all have bad feelings toward your mother. that doesn't mean you have to go along with what they want.  They should want you to be happy.", "NTA they\u2019re being just as toxic as your mother trying yo force you to cut & dye your hair when you don\u2019t want to", "NTA.  Your siblings have become their hair obsessed mother.", "NTA. Your siblings sound like they all need therapy. If you love your hair, then leave it alone.", "NTA,\n\nIt's your hair do with it what you want.\n\nBut you are all young and I wouldn't be surprised if all if you are suffering from some sort of trauma due to your upbringing.\n\nMaybe look into counseling, your school might have an actual psychologist.\n\nI know you're young and your siblings probably seem older and wiser, but you're all just kids trying to deal with a really hard thing.\n\nTry to give your siblings some slack and also voice that you hope they will understand where you're coming from. \n\nIf you do decide to cut or dye it you could use the non permanent dye that washes out. If that's what you feel like doing. But again do what you want with your own body", "NTA! you do you", "NTA. They are doing the same thing to you as your mom is - determining your value and position in the family by your hair. Superficial and ridiculous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re a minor so I can\u2019t exactly tell you to run away and never look back or something but I seriously think you should talk about this with a trusted adult that has no bias towards your mother. Perhaps calling a hotline since your mother has intentionally isolated you from adults in support systems like doctors and teachers. This is serious and your siblings I\u2019m sure would aid you in reporting her", "Are any of your older siblings moved out? Maybe when you turn 18 you can move in with one of them.

I got two funny stories, actually lol.\n\nThe first one was I dyed my bangs blue and would get some additional blonde highlights. As my stylist, who I love and does an amazing job, was washing the extra dye out, it bleed into my *natural and artificial* highlights. Thus, I had a sea greenish highlight throughout my hair. Both of us were spooked and finding it funny later. My stylist she had to take like a bleach shampoo to fix it, and that burned.\n\nThe other story was I was dyeing my bangs purple kind of like a dark plum. It turned auburn. Like red brown auburn. It looked good, though, so I kept it.\n\nThe blonde I have soaks up dye. When I was doing a coat of the dye product, which, from what I have heard, can give an extra layer of protection and semi seal, some split ends. I had a slight tint of red put in.
