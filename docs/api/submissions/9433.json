My stepson, Sean, is 18 and he is in university.  He lives with his dad and I so he can go to school in our city.  His mom lives on an acreage about 40 km north if town so that would be quite the commute.  \n\nI didn't really want him in my house but my husband insisted and promised me that Sean would behave.  He would clean up after himself and he would not cause me any problems.  \n\nHe isn't a bad kid.  He does his chores and keeps to himself mostly.  He had some trouble with staying up late and being disruptive when he got here last summer but we got that sorted out.  \n\nMy husband and I have a three year old daughter.  Sean is friendly with her and has babysat her a few times.  \n\nThe problem is he smokes so much weed.  I'm honestly surprised he isn't failing out of school. \n\nI personally don't care.  Except we agreed he would smoke outside or in the garage. And he's been smoking up in his room.  \n\nThree problems. \n\n1. My daughter doesn't need to get a contact high. \n\n2.  It stinks\n\n3. He has the window open so we are paying to heat up the house constantly.  \n\nFuck that noise.   I spoke with my husband and told him that Sean wasn't following the rules we had agreed to.  He had one more chance then he had to find somewhere else to live.  \n\nSean said he was sorry and he promised he would behave.  He even showed me that he bought edibles so he wouldn't get his sister high, stink up the house, or need to open his window.  \n\nIt was fine for two weeks and then he did it again.   So I kicked him out.  I packed up his shit and took it all to his mom's place. And I had the lock codes changed. \n\nWhen he got home from school he lost his shit.  He said that I was being a controlling bitch and that I didn't have any right to tell him what to do in his father's house.  I laughed in his face.  I told him that the only house his father ever bought is the one his mother lives in.  His dad is my husband but they are both living in my house.  \n\nI guess he didn't know that and he started apologizing.  I called him an Uber to take him to his mother.   He didn't go and he called my husband instead.  My husband made arrangements with his brother for Sean to move there.  His mom drove all his belongings back into town and now he isn't my problem.  \n\nUnfortunately for Sean his uncle is completely against cannabis. So he can't have any there.  And he is currently sleeping on a hide-a-bed.  His dad, uncle, and himself are going to build him a room in the unfinished basement this weekend.  \n\nMy husband is on my side since Sean broke our agreement.  His mother is salty about having to come into town.  And Sean is begging me to let him come back.", "created_utc": 1675852653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wtfx2/aita_for_kicking_my_stepson_out_of_the_house_for/", "score": 16136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your house, your (reasonable\u2026) rules.\n\nOn the other hand, I dunno if I\u2019d kick my kid out over this.\n\nOn a third hand, your reasoning is suspect.  Your daughter isn\u2019t gonna get a contact high from your son smoking in his room.  I also cannot believe this is causing a significant resource strain.  \n\nThe cherry on top: Taking his stuff out of his room and to his mother\u2019s seemingly without providing *anyone* with notice is over-the-top. \n\nNo one here has been making particularly thoughtful decisions.", "\u201c I didn\u2019t really want him in my house\u201d. \u2026 so you found the first thing to get your way.

You have blown a minor disagreement completely out of proportion and then used it as an excuse to act unilaterally, and create a huge dramatic blow up over what didn't actually have to be one and in the process created a problem for your husband with his ex wife and also rudely emasculated your husband to his son while simultaneously denigrating your own marriage.\n\nWhich leads me to wonder how much of this is about your ludicrous fears of \"contact high\" (you've seen too many Cheech and Chong movies, contact high in the room is hard enough, at a distance? Lol!) and how much is about your ongoing resentment over your stepson living with you to begin with?\n\nIt's clear that the previous living arrangement wasn't working out, but there was no actual urgent reason to pull this stunt with your husband away, and REALLY no reason to ship his things to a destination arbitrarily chosen by you. Literally the only reason to do that is to be petty.\n\nThe more I think about this, the more it smells like you finally having an excuse to do what you've wanted to do from day one as you've resented his existence in your home from day one.\n\nThe reason the kid sucks should be obvious.", "ESH\n\nyou suck for how you kicked him out, and for not wanting your stepson in the house in the first place.

You kicked someone who for all intensive purposes is your dependant out of the house whilst they were at school rather than have a mature conversation with them. On top of this you seem to enjoy the fact that his mother is upset and seemed to needlessly involve her in a way that caused a lot of grief on her side purely because you were too immature to have a real conversation with your SON (not step son, you married your husband knowing full well he had a son) about him moving out and allowing him time to sort out alternative arrangements.

Smoking weed indoors, even if against your rules and requiring some level of consequences, is not an insta-expel your stepkids from the home offence.

In an actual rental situation this would be whole cloth an illegal eviction and he has tenants rights at your house. \n\nThis was very obviously entirely about power, and it is weird you seem annoyed that he isn't failing out of school?

I do understand he's living in your home and all but it's kinda actually not just kinda but hella messed up you kicked him out. I'm THC high right now. Been smoking since 12. In all honesty you could have just talked to your step son about other alternatives. Dabs don't smell...

Your stepson is out of line by smoking weed while it was agreed beforehand he should not. However, you stated that you really did not want him to live with you.

I think a lot of people are getting triggered by how you described asserting yourself in your own household, but I get it. Stepsons behavior seems like it comes from a place of disrespect for you as an authority figure, and that would piss me off too. I think a lot of commenters, if they were being honest, would agree. It's hard to empathize with \"the bad guy\" though, especially when I think a lot of people reading this have probably been in your stepsons shoes or other similar situations.  \n\nAuthoritarian stuff like packing his stuff and moving it before he got home is a little borderline, but definitely not evidence you're a whole-on asshole, especially given the conversations you describe having in advance. You've got your own kid to consider, though, and I hope you show her consistent respect and unconditional support.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't ever consider you as deserving of appropriate respect.

No longer lives in house.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him multiple chances to rectify his behavior and follow your very basic and reasonable and  easy-to-follow rules, and he didn't. Then he got uppity when he thought it was his dad's house, and immediately changed his tune when he realized the house was yours. He had no intention of following your rules. He was still allowed to smoke his devil's lettuce, all he had to do was do it outside but he couldn't even do that. \n\nEveryone seems to be forgetting that stepson was smoking indoors and running the very serious risk of getting a three year old high, which he didn't even care about. Change it to cigarettes, or leaving half-full bottles of alcohol lying around the house, and Reddit would be losing its collective shit.

But you didn\u2019t even say not on the property, you set some common sense rules, hell those are rules me and my brothers have between us, you don\u2019t smoke inside because of the smell, and no matter how high anyone is the dog needs to be watched out for. If we as three young adult men can maintain those rules between us, it\u2019s crazy he couldn\u2019t follow your rules. He deserves the punishment.", "NTA. He f\u2019d around and found out that you meant what you said. It\u2019s basically a matter of respect for your property.  Cigarettes are legal too, but I still don\u2019t allow people to smoke them in my house.", "NTA but you definitely could've handled it better. There seems to be the idea that because you evicted him without notice and you just arbitrarily changed the locks and took out all of his stuff, it's an illegal eviction. Nope, it appears by your post that he's not paying rent so you don't need to abide by any tenant/landlord laws if that's the case. Also, you and his father gave him multiple chances and explanations about the rules, and he failed to honor them. How many *more* times would you have had to explain everything to him and how many *more* chances would you have had to give him before he decided to abide by the rules that both you and your husband set forth? It seems to me he grew up in an environment with little or no consequences until you showed him the door. He's only begging to come back home so he can continue smoking, but there again, how long will it be before he's up to his old tricks? The core issue with his behavior is that he has complete disregard for the rules and an idea that he can get away with whatever he wants (at least until you sent him packing). He had to learn that somewhere; thankfully it wasn't from you.", "No I not ever kicky son out for pot smoy", "Yeah you TA. \u201cMy step son.\u201d \u201cMy daughter.\u201d Nuff said", "NTA\n\nYour rules are very reasonably and you warned him what would happen if he broke them...", "NTA but people on forums really hate step parents.\nYou can\u2019t love your kid more than you do your step kids but if you love them equally then you got to back off cause your not their parent. \n\nIt was his dads responsibility to stop him smoking weed in the house and if he was even remotely butthurt about you kicking him out (which thankfully he\u2019s not) he\u2019s free to leave you and get a place for him and Sean.\n\nNothing against weed but that stuffs strong and sticks to clothing and furniture when smoked indoors.", "NTA\nHe broke the rules and showed you extreme disrespect.", "NTA, you gave him multiple chances and possible solutions and he just refused, figuring he wouldn't be kicked out. \nYou could have executed the kicking out better for sure, less drama would've been good, but at the same time that might've been the wake up call he needed to understand that not following rules can have awful consequences.", "NTA, he broke the rules.\n\nNow, imagine how your husbands next wife will treat your daughter....", "I would do the same.

It is perfectly legal.  My stepson, Sean, is 18 and he is in university.  He lives with his dad and I so he can go to school in our city.  His mom lives on an acreage about 40 km north if town so that would be quite the commute.  \n\nI didn't really want him in my house but my husband insisted and promised me that Sean would behave.  He would clean up after himself and he would not cause me any problems.  \n\nHe isn't a bad kid.  He does his chores and keeps to himself mostly.  He had some trouble with staying up late and being disruptive when he got here last summer but we got that sorted out.  \n\nMy husband and I have a three year old daughter.  Sean is friendly with her and has babysat her a few times.  \n\nThe problem is he smokes so much weed.  I'm honestly surprised he isn't failing out of school. \n\nI personally don't care.  Except we agreed he would smoke outside or in the garage. And he's been smoking up in his room.  \n\nThree problems. \n\n1. My daughter doesn't need to get a contact high. \n\n2.  It stinks\n\n3. He has the window open so we are paying to heat up the house constantly.  \n\nFuck that noise.   I spoke with my husband and told him that Sean wasn't following the rules we had agreed to.  He had one more chance then he had to find somewhere else to live.  \n\nSean said he was sorry and he promised he would behave.  He even showed me that he bought edibles so he wouldn't get his sister high, stink up the house, or need to open his window.  \n\nIt was fine for two weeks and then he did it again.   So I kicked him out.  I packed up his shit and took it all to his mom's place. And I had the lock codes changed. \n\nWhen he got home from school he lost his shit.  He said that I was being a controlling bitch and that I didn't have any right to tell him what to do in his father's house.  I laughed in his face.  I told him that the only house his father ever bought is the one his mother lives in.  His dad is my husband but they are both living in my house.  \n\nI guess he didn't know that and he started apologizing.  I called him an Uber to take him to his mother.   He didn't go and he called my husband instead.  My husband made arrangements with his brother for Sean to move there.  His mom drove all his belongings back into town and now he isn't my problem.  \n\nUnfortunately for Sean his uncle is completely against cannabis. So he can't have any there.  And he is currently sleeping on a hide-a-bed.  His dad, uncle, and himself are going to build him a room in the unfinished basement this weekend.  \n\nMy husband is on my side since Sean broke our agreement.  His mother is salty about having to come into town.  And Sean is begging me to let him come back.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA for the childish and melodramatic way you threw him out. Changing locks and packing everything up while he was out? Why didn\u2019t you wait till he got home and tell him that this was happening today, or tomorrow morning.  Then laughing at him because he didn\u2019t know you own the house?\n\nYes, he did the wrong thing and broke the rules so he had to move out but you seem to be really relishing up ending an 18 year old\u2019s life and being on your high horse.

OP has good reasons to kick him out (health and financial). The fact she eats edibles is moot, she never said she was against drugs, just smoking, which I can totally get behind.\n\nHowever, YTA for the way you did it. Would it have been awful to give him a day or 2 to pack his stuff and move to his mother\u2019s place or make arrangements then to go live with his uncle?

If I smoke inside, it's when the kids are not there ,but I also have a vent in my kitchen that blows it out side. I don't do it near my kids. If they are near me.

Did you ask him if he\u2019s struggling at school, with mental health, or something else?\n4. Did you ask him if he is safe or had a trauma happen to him?\n5. Did you offer rehab or counseling?\n\nI get you are upset he\u2019s smoking weed in your house and you want to protect your daughter.  However, smoking that much weed daily isn\u2019t something someone can suddenly turn off.

You are not a nice person.", "NTA- if you asked him not to do it in the house and he kept doing it that's really not unreasonable.", "NTA for not wanting him to smoke weed in the house but YTA for your attitude towards him in general.", "NTA, but really glad you\u2019re not my step-mom", "You were actually very generous in letting him smoke in your garage or wherever.

He was spoken to numerous times and even offered him the garage to smoke in. He purposely disobeyed and disrespected the rules of the house several times.

If he was smoking in his room w the window down, absolutely no one in the house sans him would be getting high.\n\nBut hey, you sure did show that CHILD whose boss, though.", "YTA.  Sorry but you opened with \"I never wanted him here.\"  You had an agenda, the reality is the kid could have done everything right, and you would still have found a reason to kick him out.\n\nMaybe seek some therapy to figure out why you hate a teenager so much.", "NAH. You can have who you want stay at your house and he can smoke all he wants.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t want your step son to live with you, you are very obvious about that. Contact high isn\u2019t really a thing, and having a window open briefly in the winter is also not really a thing. But he broke your rule so you have the right to ask him to leave. But packing his stuff up and moving it while he\u2019s at school? Of course he got upset.

He could live in a dorm, in an apartment on his own, or commute from his mother\u2019s house. None of those options are ideal, but they do exist. He lives for free in a house his step-mother owns; he is not a tenant. She is not a landlord. There is no lease. It is a very clearly set boundary for a very reasonable rule which has been repeatedly violated.\n\nAfter multiple warnings, what would you do? There is definitely a better way to have handled moving all his stuff, but that doesn\u2019t in principle make her the AH. And what I think is very telling is that despite being given multiple warnings and \u201cone last chance\u201d he pushed back and said that he couldn\u2019t be kicked out of his father\u2019s house. Sounds like if he\u2019d known his dad didn\u2019t own the house that he would have been better about respecting the clearly articulated rules. That sounds like he doesn\u2019t respect his stepmother as an enforcer of rules that both his father and mother also agreed to as fair. And once again, these clearly articulated rules are to provide him free housing that is more convenient for university, which is a convenience and a privilege but not a right. \n\nOf course she\u2019s NTA. However now that he\u2019s had his chance to FAFO and she has proven that she is serious about her boundary, it would be better for long-term family harmony and relationships to let him move back in with a clearly established expectation that there are no more warnings and further smoking infractions result in a permanent loss of housing.", "Although I wouldn\u2019t be so harsh - packing up and changing locks - I get your frustration, you are NTA. \nHowever, do consider taking him back, he\u2019s still a teenager - adult only in paper.

You were nice to him. You offered alternatives. You made compromises. He still did not respect your home. \n\nI am all pro legalizing weed.

Also, most users don\u2019t even continue smoking son most likely he will quit anyway! And 3. Gummies don\u2019t work for everyone. They kick in slowly and you end up eating too much. Therefore, it ends up worse than actually smoking it. \nThen you decided to not only be petty and send all his stuff to his mom\u2019s which you knew was out of his way for school but made your husband choose you over his son. The fact you brought up to him the house was yours and pretty much your husband just lives there was the ultimate form of saying to him that his dad is whipped by you. Honestly, if I was his dad I would leave you. \nHe did everything else you wanted correctly. However, he smoked with the window open. Big deal!

I agree with some of the comments that maybe it\u2019s just the way it\u2019s phrased here but you do sound smug (maybe even a bit proud) that he is out of the house. We see so many posts about step-parents treating their stepkids differently than they do their bio children, please make sure this is not one of those cases. \n\nHere\u2019s where those biases come in, I know that not every smoker is like this, but I have known multiple people in my direct life who were given direct, simple, explicit rules like this (you are allowed to smoke, just not in these areas/when these people are home) and they don\u2019t follow them.

Even with keeping edibles in the house, I know two examples (again, of direct friends, not just \u201cI heard this happen to someone) who accidentally ate edibles as kids/teens because their older siblings left them unlabeled in the kitchen and thought they were just normal baked goods. One of my friends ended up going to the hospital because of this because she had a heart condition and ate so many rapidly that it was literally causing her so much concern and she didn\u2019t know what was happening. So when you said that he was keeping edibles in the house instead of smoking, that got me nervous just based on past experience. Your three year old is at that age where if she sees a food she\u2019s familiar with, she\u2019ll eat it without question.

Help that Sean needs that he can only get from his parents. Clearly Sean is not willing to get that help or even be around his mother, and you forced the only parent he still trusts to kick him out. He is *your* stepson, your husband's son and a much better approach would have been to show smaller consequences such as charging him for a portion or all of the heating bill before choosing the nuclear option of kicking him out. \nI'd sooner believe that you hold a stigma against weed usage or there's a previous event you're not informing us of that led you to kicking him out rather than two incidents of him smoking weed in the house. \n\nNow Sean has to figure out how life works on his own without the support of a parent, and its going to suck.

But you packed up his stuff, drove it miles away, and changed the locks while he was gone one day. You clearly enjoyed all this and reveled in it. Your joy in getting him out of your house is palpable. On the facts of what you presented, NTA. But your motivations weren\u2019t pure and you were excited to get to do this.", "Oh give me a break! I read right through this BS. Yes he broke your rule BUT you never wanted him in your house to begin with. I hope you're just as steadfast when your bio kid becomes his age. \n\nI worked with young ppl, so I get them. I also worked with children and youth who are dealing with trauma. I can tell you the stepparent and stepchild dynamics and you ma'am, fit in some of the traumas stories including my own. \n\nDid he break your rule, yes. Should he be punished, yes!  \nWas he rude, absolutely! Could you and his father decide together what should be done about him breaking your smoking rule instead of you going nuclear like that? Well....\n\nNevertheless, as you smugly said, your house your rules but I do hope nothing ever happens to you and your SO \n finds another version of you that your kid(s) will have to be  stepchild(ren) to. \n\nESH.\n\nP.s. Being young and dumb is what growing up means. Children have to grow through their pain but you have to love them in order to help them. They are trying to figure out life. So many things are at their disposal- some good and some bad but you will need patience to guide them. All children need affection and attention, but you will need to be open in order to give and receive.\n\n\"Children live, what they learm\" by Dorothy Nolte, look it up and remind yourself about child development.", "YTA. You don't like your step son and found any excuse to kick him out. And you only posted here to validate your shitty behavior.", "YTA, you are using weed and his sister as an excuse, you never wanted him there and you are looking for reasons to justify how you feel about him.", "It's freezing outside at the best of times. If there's no space heater in the garage or in the porch, then his room with a closed door and the vent shut for fifteen minutes is the best option and the one that causes the least smoke spill. Or smoking in the bathroom with the vent on to remove the smoke and stink.", "She said \"I didn't really want him in my house but my husband insisted\". She never wanted him there and was just waiting for a chance to get rid of him. She even admits he's a good kid, but she probably can't look past the fact that he has a different mother and doesn't want him messing with her \"family\". \n\nShe already prefaces the move by stating all the reasons that she wants him out: Contact high, failing school, high heating bill, but she doesn't state that any of those things have actually happened.\n\nShe definitely sounds smug and glad that she gets to kick her stepson out of her house. She seemed practically delighted to spring this on him by driving all of his possessions 40 miles out of town to his mother's house without him even getting a chance to pack up.", "Good catch, i didn't register that until you called it out.", "Of course there could be a path but it has to include protecting the environment the three year old lives in."]}
