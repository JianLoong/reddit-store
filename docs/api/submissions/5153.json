After graduation we got jobs in the same company, I was ecstatic as I really liked the idea of us being together even after college. \nSo here is the incident. One of our coworker(27M) steve likes Amy. He asked her out on a date. He was planning on quitting the company after 2 months as he got a better job opportunity abroad. Amy is currently single and is looking for relationship. The thing is that Amy started hating Steve as he got the job abroad to which she had also applied. When Steve asked her out Amy declined it in a friendly way and told him to not bring that up later. It was going all good until one of my other coworker told me that Steve had been fired from our company and his job abroad is also at stake as somebody reported him work harrasment. \n\nI was shocked and confused he was a good guy, like genuinely he was a good guy even Amy talked good about him. Later that evening Amy told that it was her who reported him to the HR for harrasment.  I asked her what happened, apparently he told her that he still likes her. I asked her if he had misbehaved with her. She fucking laughed at my face when I was concerned about her. She then proceeded to tell me that she just didn't like the guy. She hated that he got the job. So when steve talked to her she saw it as a chance to loose his new job as she was the next in line to get that job. She then told me that she felt sorry for him as she thought that steve would only loose his new job not the one that he have in our compny. \nI got furious and shouted at her that I will inform this to the company and went home. I don't know what to do. If I report her to the HR then Amy's carrer will be over but at the same time I want to help Steve. I just can't look at Amy the same way. Amy's family has been texting and calling me the AH. They are furious at me as I said I'll report it to the HR. \nI am feeling betrayed by her,  I don't know what made her do this\nAITA for wanting to report against Amy?\n\nEDIT: I went to work today and learned that he was NOT FIRED but was SUSPENDED until the HR investigation is done and they are withdrawing the recommendation the company made for his new job until the investigation is done which will result in him loosing the new job. I'm going to talk to Amy and \"apologize\" to her so that I can hear the entire story about what she told to the HR.", "created_utc": 1671476094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq04e5/aitafor_reporting_my_best_friend_to_the_hr/", "score": 979, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
