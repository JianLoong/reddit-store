After graduation we got jobs in the same company, I was ecstatic as I really liked the idea of us being together even after college. \nSo here is the incident. One of our coworker(27M) steve likes Amy. He asked her out on a date. He was planning on quitting the company after 2 months as he got a better job opportunity abroad. Amy is currently single and is looking for relationship. The thing is that Amy started hating Steve as he got the job abroad to which she had also applied. When Steve asked her out Amy declined it in a friendly way and told him to not bring that up later. It was going all good until one of my other coworker told me that Steve had been fired from our company and his job abroad is also at stake as somebody reported him work harrasment. \n\nI was shocked and confused he was a good guy, like genuinely he was a good guy even Amy talked good about him. Later that evening Amy told that it was her who reported him to the HR for harrasment.  I asked her what happened, apparently he told her that he still likes her. I asked her if he had misbehaved with her. She fucking laughed at my face when I was concerned about her. She then proceeded to tell me that she just didn't like the guy. She hated that he got the job. So when steve talked to her she saw it as a chance to loose his new job as she was the next in line to get that job. She then told me that she felt sorry for him as she thought that steve would only loose his new job not the one that he have in our compny. \nI got furious and shouted at her that I will inform this to the company and went home. I don't know what to do. If I report her to the HR then Amy's carrer will be over but at the same time I want to help Steve. I just can't look at Amy the same way. Amy's family has been texting and calling me the AH. They are furious at me as I said I'll report it to the HR. \nI am feeling betrayed by her,  I don't know what made her do this\nAITA for wanting to report against Amy?", "created_utc": 1671476094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq04e5/aitafor_reporting_my_best_friend_to_the_hr/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the lowest of the low and she needs to be punished for this.", "NTA but you would be if you didn't report this.  Your \"friend\" and I use the term VERY lightly, used a false SH report to cost this man his job and livelihood just because she was jealous he got a job opportunity she wanted.

Don't let get ruin someone else's career to better her own.", "NTA- Tell HR immediately! This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour from Amy! She's lying and accusing someone of harassment, ruining their reputation and getting them fired all for her personal gain. I would seriously consider if you want to continue to have her as a friend in your life", "NTA. Report her. Now. Imagine if Steve was a friend or family member of yours. False allegations RUIN LIVES.\n\nAnd I agree with other comments, you need to report her AT LEAST to cover yourself. She will not hesitate to make up a story that costs you your job. And I\u2019m guessing she knows enough of your secrets to make sure it\u2019s believable.\n\nAgain, NTA. And you\u2019re better off without this \u201cfriend.\u201d", "NTA\n\nYou know the truth. She intentionally ruined his reputation and career. Better make it fast or she'll do the same to you.", "NTA\n\nI'd be questioning your friends character.

How many more innocent people is she willing to sacrifice.  \n\nAlso, send the note to HR now before she has the chance to go to then about you first.  She already has already shown that she will lie to HR to save herself.", "NTA. You need to write down what she said, where she said it, etc. Who, what, where and when. If there's any screenshots, save them. \n\nIf she's dumb enough to confess to one person, she'll tell others. It will leak. And you can either be the one coming clean, or getting fired/sued for helping cover it up. \n\nPlus, I guarantee if she thinks you're going to HR, she will want to find something to pin on you. Whoever reports first tends to look the most honest. Do the right and smart thing. Write it all up, give it to HR and Steve.", "Info:  Did he ask her out a second time?

Do the right thing. Doing the right thing isn't always easy, but it must be done", "NTA. You will be a major AH if you don\u2019t report it.

She is making it harder for people who are actually harassed to be taken seriously. \n\nShe's also messing with another persons career and reputation. Report what Amy did and use the text messages as proof. Also tell Steve what she did, hopefully he sues her for slander. \n\nThis goes beyond she my \"friend\" if she's willing to stab someone in the back with a sexual harassment complaint, what else is she willing to do to further her career?\n\nNTA but you will be if you don't report her. Also watch your back, she might come back with a BS complaint saying you're victim shaming and go to HR.", "NTA\n\nWeaponizing false or exaggerated SH claims for personal gain is a peer to SH itself in my opinion. \n\nReal SH needs to be stamped out and harshly - so good for your HR dept hitting hard and fast. But it\u2019s not meant to destroy the job of someone politely asking a coworker out, respecting the now, and politely inquiring or expressing interest later with no other harassment activity in between. \n\nThese people claiming that\u2019s harassment are probably joyous to be around. :(", "NTA. Amy deliberately LIED about harassment out of spite to deliberately threaten Steve's job. That is NOT someone I would want working for my company.", "ESH. Steve ignored Amy\u2019s request to not mention this again. Telling her he still liked her at work is harassment. She is not responsible for his unwelcome emotions and she is within her rights to report his persistence in treating her like a potential romantic partner rather than a colleague. If he loses his future job, it would be because of his behavior, not because of Amy\u2019s report. If Amy exaggerated his behavior, she is also TA, but this is not at all clear from your OP. You seem very dismissive of your \u201cbest friend\u201d because it\u2019s a good guy that was bothering her. She told you what he did, and you just asked what more, as if this wasn\u2019t enough to be a problem. If it were the office creep, would you understand her better? He doesn\u2019t need to assault her for it to be misbehavior. Why are you so concerned with helping Steve? In what way is any of this a betrayal of you?", "She has enitionated a pre emptive strike against him to get his job, report her", "NTA, but you would be if you let her get away with it.  Please please report her, this will damage all aspects of his life, not just his career. I've been falsely accused and it is horrific, all the ways this kind of bullshit affects a person", "NTA REPORT HER! Why is this even a question!!!???", "NTA.    And this - this right here - is why that \"believe all women\" thing was ridiculous, like women aren't capable of devious, malicious, spiteful behavior.", "Amy has shown you who she really is.

Then he brought it up again. \n\nThat is declared harassment.", "Yta. She had already told him she wasn't interested and didn't want to talk about it again and yet he was still telling her he liked her that is harassment and is inappropriate at work so her reporting that is fair. She didn't false report anything unless she claimed he did more then what occured.
