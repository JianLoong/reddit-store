I am the primary caregiver due to my wife\u2019s work schedule being all over the place while mine is a more flexible 9-5. \n\nYesterday I went to get groceries for dinner as she asked while she was working and she specifically wanted frozen sweet potato fries. \n\nWhen she got home I prepared everything and put the fries in the oven as per the instructions. The bag had a fair amount of ice in it as well but she said to just leave it and it would be fine. About 10 minutes later our oven was steaming and the fries were a bit burnt with some black charring on some of them. \n\nWhen she saw that she immediately got angry with me and blamed me for putting fries on the top shelf of the oven. Now we rarely eat frozen oven made food and there was nothing about where in the oven to put the fries\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a thing but I wasn\u2019t aware. \n\nShe told me I ruined dinner and despite me trying to salvage the fries and cut off burnt parts, she refused to eat dinner while our son was sitting and waiting for us. I made her plate anyway and she said she\u2019d only eat if I didn\u2019t eat with them. She then proceeded to pull out each fry, say they were burnt and throw them off her plate into the table or floor. \n\nI walked away upset and stayed in our bedroom while she and our son ate at the table. I tried to apologize a few times and tell her it was an honest mistake as well as that I\u2019d go and get more or an alternative. To which she refused and told me I ruined dinner. \n\nThey ate, then I put our son down to bed and she ignored me. I ended up sleeping on the couch with our son who wasn\u2019t feeling well over night. \n\nThis morning I explained how the situation made me feel and how her reaction and wanting of me to go away made me feel. Her response was that she isn\u2019t sorry, she isn\u2019t going to change how she feels as it\u2019s her opinion and that I was the issue. She also said she regretted taking the day off work (as she had the option to due to staffing). \n\nTL;DR - burnt fries by accident pregnant wife said I ruined dinner and doesn\u2019t feel she did anything wrong in her reaction. \n\nAm I wrong for wanting an apology and for her to acknowledge that her reaction was excessive? I understand hormones during pregnancy but this is a new one for me. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m doubly upset as she works every other weekend and so we rarely get weekends to do things. I\u2019m being met with attitude and treated like I\u2019m at fault for further ruining today in which we had plans to do things that are now not getting done. I appreciate the responses as this is bothering me way more than I wanted to let it. I\u2019ve tried to be Incredibly patient especially as this is our second pregnancy but I find this time she\u2019s far more agressive and short tempered and I\u2019m having a hard time trying to deal with it. \n\n\nThanks in advance!", "created_utc": 1701026693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184igkd/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_pregnant_wifes/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her reaction was mean, manipulative, and weirdly childish \u2014 she threw the fries on the floor and made you leave the room?? Honestly, wtf. Pregnancy is not an excuse for this type of behavior.\n\nIf this is how she has always treated you, or if she doesn\u2019t come back to her senses and recognize how shitty she was, then I strongly recommend you get solo counseling as this is a bigger issue and her behavior has a lot of red flags for abuse, and couples counseling in that context can be really harmful. \n\nIf this is an aberration and she comes around to behaving normally then I strongly suggest she get some medical attention and counseling to figure out what\u2019s going on bc it\u2019s not ok for her to treat you like that.", "NTA.

My husband came home from work once and found me crying in the kitchen because I couldn't open the pickles, which I didn't even really want, but we were also out of potato chips, so. Tears. Pregnancy hormones are wild. \n\nThat being said, they are NOT an excuse for being cruel or manipulative. They do NOT give someone the right to become a tyrant. \n\nYes, your wife is going through a lot, and it might make her feel a little crazy sometimes, but she doesn't get to just be an uncontrolled jerk because of it. Crying over cravings? Bonkers but it happens. Acting like a monster and refusing to apologize when things calm down? Girl, nah.", "I\u2019d start recording the outbursts.", "NTA. She owes you apologies. I\u2019d cool it on talking to her at all until she realizes that and behaves properly towards you.", "NTA.

Refusing to let you eat with the family? Giving you the silent treatment?

It was a few fkn fries. Jesus. And what is she, 5? Throwing food on the floor?? What the hell is the matter with her? \n\nHer absolutely embarrassing, ridiculous reaction aside: I find it extremely problematic that after you addressed it again and explained how her OTT reaction made you feel (which so many men never do), all she did was brush it off, as if it didn\u2019t matter. I would recommend to keep a closer eye on that kind of behavioral pattern. Sometimes it\u2019s really just one-off - and sometimes an event triggers a deeper understanding that this happens quite often.", "NTA.  Her passive -aggressive response is emotionally abusive.

Why have another child with her and ask if your the problem ?", "I'm very sympathetic to the wild ride that are pregnancy hormones. Rational thought and self-restraint can go out the window. \nTrue, pregnancy is not an excuse to be an ass, but... well, sometimes it is. And if not an excuse, then at least a valid explanation. But there is more at play here:\n\nHer being irrationally angry and her blaming you for stuff that isn't your fault is one thing. Hell, when my wife was pregnant, she would occasionally blame me for the traffic or get angry at the weather. But what really sticks out in your story is her throwing the fries on the floor and - more importantly - her throwing you out/insisting that both she and your child would only eat if you left. That's not being irrationally angry/hormonal rage, those are power moves, clear and simple. She was demanding submission, and that is nothing that pregnancy hormones do to a woman (afaik), that's indicative of a character trait or at least of her perception of the power dynamics in your relationship.\n\nOf course you are NTA. You deserve an apology; if you insist on one in this specific situation is up to you. But unless this was a one-time thing that is otherwise totally out of character for her, you have much bigger issues to deal with.", "Why would you have another child with a L\u2019Or\u00e9al child? This isn\u2019t the first time nor will it be the last.", "NTA... Not making any excuses, I saw your other responses that this isn't typical. It sounds like pregnancy hormones brought out a green eyed monster. Maybe some time to calm down and she'll see the absurdity of it... Or within 9mo she will. Hang in there, growing tiny humans is tough for everyone.", "Has she cheated, is the baby yours? Is she trying to push you out of home?", "ESH. She behaved terribly, and it's only partially mitigated by the hormones she's experiencing. But you're a grown-ass adult who doesn't know how to cook frozen french fries in the oven without being supervised by your wife. If you don't know how to cook something, google it. It's not her fault that you never learned to use an oven.\n\nAll that said, she needs a medical evaluation. Pregnancy-related mood disorders can begin before the birth, so if this is out of character for her, you need to tell her doctor so she can get help.
