In general I believe it\u2019s very bad form to explicitly exclude someone\u2019s partner, particularly a family members partner, especially from a family heavy event (except for the instances in which that person is an abuser or unsafe). Besides, your brothers wife is your family by law regardless of the fact she\u2019s childish. Her childishness does not mean that you have to stoop to her level. I understand it can be frustrating and painful when someone dislikes you for seemingly petty reasons. It\u2019s unfair, maddening, and causes needlessly tensions.But excluding her from your wedding is very hurtful to someone you do care about, your brother. N yes yes I know Reddit seems to think because a bride or groom are the rightful center of attention at their wedding it allows them to do whatever they want. But again this isn\u2019t some random girl your brother is dating, this is his wife. Do you not have a good relationship with your brother? Do you not want him at your wedding? \n\nFrankly, I think that if you feel that her vitriol is so extreme that you must exclude her and her daughter, then why are you inviting your brother? He is equally to blame for being so complacent to his wife disrespect and disdain. To me it seems petty and indirect to invite him but not her. It\u2019s pretty social understood that couples are typically packaged goods? In fact it seems a more poignant a statement of your boundaries and intolerance of disdain to not invite either. \n\nPerhaps an alternative would be to talk to your brother about why you felt the need to not invite her your wedding. Tell him what behaviors of hers need to change(\u201cthe whole you don\u2019t have to like but you need to treat me with respect and decency\u201d). Perhaps ask him to cover the cost of his wife and stepdaughter. And if it comes to, then maintain your boundary. \n\nAdditionally, how old is your stepdaughter? Her age might explain why she blindly follows her mom.

We shared many things in common (my sister is only 5 years older than me) so for 15 years, we went at festivals, concerts, hollydays together, with or without my sister. When they broke up, I was devastaded. When later, my sister started to date another guy, I wasn't very nice to him. I made very clear with all my attitude (still polite but cold af) that he wasn't family and that I wasn't happy with the situation. Every chance I had to bring the ex back, I did it. I invited him to family events, brought him along in family hollidays. Even if it was just in conversations, I made sure he was always present in the mind of the new guy. Of course, the new guy got sick of my attitude towards him (with reason) and our relationship was at best, non existant. And yeah, he also asked me to stop inviting the ex and, when he talked about it later he told me that it wasn't really the invitation that bugged him. He understood that he was and will always be my friend. But my attitude wasn't right like, bringing back memories of me, him and my sister, lots of inside jokes and then looking at the new guy saying \"you won't get it\" (damn I was such a bitch) \n\nIt took me almost loosing the relationship I had with my sister to realize what I was doing (being a stupid brat) and I finally gave him a chance. I didn't like to admit it, but I was very wrong and he's actually a very nice guy. He's awsome and much more perfect for my sister. I didn't went NC with her ex neither. I just stopped including him in family stuff, because he wasn't family no matter how much I liked him to be. \n\nI think you have the right to invite who you want at your wedding and you don't have to compromise for anyone (other than the groom). But I believe that your brother is trying to tell you that his new wife is his family now and if you keep denying that then you should stop considering him family too. I don't think that, for your brother, your dilema is the wedding guest list. He's probably warning you that you're about to lose him. \n\nYour choice depends on the relationships you have with all the people involved and what happened since the new gf entered your life.

You basically dumped a big drama bomb on the family and picked a fight with Lisa and Liz who I assume is a teenager...\n\nYour brother is very understandably upset because of all the drama he now has to deal with from this and you've put him in a lose-lose situation. Not going to your wedding is obviously gonna make him feel horrible but he'd be a horrible father if he went excluding his step-daughter and wife.\n\nWhile its your right to invite who you want to your wedding, family's often come in packages.

I'm assuming Liz isn't an adult, so I think your horrible for bringing a child into the middle of this. A childless wedding would be one thing, but you're an ass inviting some members of the household and excluding others.

I understand you don\u2019t get along with Lisa and may feel salty about paying for her or wish she wasn\u2019t there, but inviting one half of a married couple isn\u2019t really acceptable except in extreme situations and this doesn\u2019t seem like one of them. \n\nNot inviting Liz, who is a child, also feels pretty bad. How is your brother supposed to explain this to her exactly? Hey honey, me and all your siblings are going to OPs wedding but you weren\u2019t invited because OP doesn\u2019t like you. Hope you don\u2019t mind! I don\u2019t think this is a fair situation to put anyone in, not your brother, not Liz, and not the other siblings. No matter what decision your brother makes you\u2019ve basically guaranteed there will be tension and resentment from multiple parties. Plus you\u2019re threatening the ability for your other niblings to come since your brother may decide the best course of action is for no one to attend.\n\nLike yes, this is your day, but that doesn\u2019t excuse you to completely ignore the effects on other people when you make inflammatory decisions. There are good reasons why nuclear families are treated as units for invitations like this. I do think you\u2019d be justified in telling Lisa that Mindy is coming and if she has a problem with it she is welcome to stay home, but I don\u2019t think excluding her preemptively is justified.

Assert why you are close to Mindy (without apology). And that it's not OK if she makes Mindy uncomfortable in any way.  This is YOUR DAY!    Also, why is Lisa being considered for this wedding?  As for closeness of family, she is in left field and not connected to you in any direct way.  Leave her out without any guilt whatsoever.  If Liz is willing to LISTEN to you, and have honest sincere conversation without putting you down but helps to validate or understand your position, then I say invite her.  But leave her daughter off.  Minimizing expenses is a legitimate reason for that.

You said that you and your brother grew apart shortly after the wedding because Lisa was mean to you but also said the issue started when you invited Mindy to your birthday. You clearly like Mindy more than Lisa and it sounds like you are not shy about letting everyone know. Are you this obvious about your feelings for Lisa (vs Mindy) at family events? Could that be why Lisa doesn\u2019t like having Mindy there? \n\nIf I were Lisa or Liz I would find this to be humiliating and would be really uncomfortable attending future gatherings.

And unless you\u2019ve gone NC with bro, you invite his wife/kids\n\nHim, bc he\u2019s having a hissy fit and imposing his demands upon you instead of discussing it with you and explaining his (& his wife\u2019s POV)\n\nLisa, bc she\u2019s intentionally being immature and selfish by not even attempting yo understand your POV, having grown up with Mindy as an important figure during your formative years, and as someone who has set aside her own (presumably) uncomfortable feelings) being around Bro & \u201cnew\u201d wife (new, as in wife #2)\n\nNot gonna label Liz tho, need more info about how behaves. And I don\u2019t wanna label a kid TBH \n\nMindy seems cool", "NTA\n\nUnder the circumstances you've explained, it sounds like Lisa has brought this situation upon herself (and your brother). Divorce, especially when there's kids involved, doesn't completely sever familial ties. You have a relationship with his ex-wife that exists outside of their relationship. Lisa doesn't get to dictate who you maintain friendships with.\n\nYou've given your brother his options, and he didn't want to accept either. That's on him. \n\nEnjoy your wedding with the people who matter most.", "How does 3 equal 1/8 of 40? On the guest list right now, his family makes up 3 spots-- him, daughter #1, and daughter #2. His ex is not part of his family, she's your friend. The other two members of his family aren't invited, so his family currently makes up only 1/15 of your guest list. And honestly, you don't really care how many people are in his family. You just don't like the new members of his family. You say they don't like you, but really it would seem that you don't particularly like them since you don't seem to want to make any effort to make them feel welcome, evidenced by always inviting his ex. I get that you are friends with her, but I can't believe you don't see that what you're doing is disrespectful to his current wife.", "Stepdaughter I can see, but wife is another story.  They're a unit now, and OP can't expect him to come if she isn't also welcome, whether she likes it or not.\n\nSounds like it's no skin off her nose, as she seems to like Mindy better than either of them.", "I have made efforts to feel welcome. And she was great for the first few months I knew her. But then during my 18th she \"found out\" I was still in contact with Mindy when she came for my 18th and blew a fuse. The only reason she has even has a relationship with my parents now is that she made them choose Mindy or her and they chose her.", "According to OP"]}
