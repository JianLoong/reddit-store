You should not ask your brother to go against his family to show you support on your wedding day. And incidentally, your brother's wife and stepdaughter are his family too. Your brother should decline the invitation if he can't supplement your budget and help you, though.

But you sound cool with that so rock on.", "I am actually really surprised by the fact that majority of people are voting NTA. In general I believe it\u2019s very bad form to explicitly exclude someone\u2019s partner, particularly a family members partner, especially from a family heavy event (except for the instances in which that person is an abuser or unsafe). Besides, your brothers wife is your family by law regardless of the fact she\u2019s childish. Her childishness does not mean that you have to stoop to her level. I understand it can be frustrating and painful when someone dislikes you for seemingly petty reasons. It\u2019s unfair, maddening, and causes needlessly tensions.But excluding her from your wedding is very hurtful to someone you do care about, your brother. N yes yes I know Reddit seems to think because a bride or groom are the rightful center of attention at their wedding it allows them to do whatever they want. But again this isn\u2019t some random girl your brother is dating, this is his wife. Do you not have a good relationship with your brother? Do you not want him at your wedding? \n\nFrankly, I think that if you feel that her vitriol is so extreme that you must exclude her and her daughter, then why are you inviting your brother? He is equally to blame for being so complacent to his wife disrespect and disdain. To me it seems petty and indirect to invite him but not her. It\u2019s pretty social understood that couples are typically packaged goods? In fact it seems a more poignant a statement of your boundaries and intolerance of disdain to not invite either. \n\nPerhaps an alternative would be to talk to your brother about why you felt the need to not invite her your wedding. Tell him what behaviors of hers need to change(\u201cthe whole you don\u2019t have to like but you need to treat me with respect and decency\u201d). Perhaps ask him to cover the cost of his wife and stepdaughter. And if it comes to, then maintain your boundary. \n\nAdditionally, how old is your stepdaughter? Her age might explain why she blindly follows her mom. In which case, don\u2019t punish a child for trusting their parent and misunderstanding social dynamics.", "NTA\n\nYour brother can invite whoever he wants to his next wedding.

You and Mindy are close but I wasn\u2019t sure your relationship with your brother bc you said you have a 20 year age gap so not close.

It\u2019s super uncool his second wife expects you to cut off contact.\n\nNTAA but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s naive to expect brother will go if his awful wife isn\u2019t invited. You have a right to not invite her but it will come with consequences.

I wondered why bc Mindy is surely around 20 years older too yet they have a sweet relationship even post divorce.", "But it'll extend to the BiL and his kids. \n\nIt's not just about Lisa no matter how many people downvote me for this (i see the numbers going down). There's a wider family effect whether OP wants to recognise that or not. This will take a small but maskable rift and turn it into a chasm.", "True, but if he is okay with his wife insulting op and demanding her to uninvite mindy all the time, then he's not a great loss either. The 2 kids would be hard, since they're innocent and op said she has a close relationship with them, but sometimes these things happen. In my family my aunt and uncle (they are siblings) didn't speak to each other about 12 years, yet the kids kept in touch with aunt/uncle. They never involved their kids in their drama. But somehow i think op's sil is petty enough to not allow that for her youngests.", "Not saying op is right but my family was like op\u2019s sil. They belittle everyone they did like. It drove you crazy."]}
