I'm having a small wedding, and the reception is being held at my aunt and uncle's house which has a big backyard. The total amount of people is 40 and only people important to us were invited.\n\nMy brother Josh has quite a big family, he and his ex-wife Mindy have 2 kids together, and his second wife Lisa has a daughter, Liz from their first marriage and 2 together with him.\n\nNeither Liz and Lisa like me. I understand why Lisa might not like me but I don't know why Liz doesn't. I didn't want to spend money on people who hate me to come to my wedding so I didn't invite Liz or Lisa (It was clearly mentioned in the wedding invitation too).\n\nEver since my brother got the invitation he is upset I'm excluding a vital part of his family. He wants me to put Lisa and Liz on the guest list. He's also mad that Mindy and her family are on the list and they (Lisa and Liz) aren't. I don't want to do it because it'll mess up my budget, his family is already 1/8 of the guest list, and again they (Liz and Lisa) hate me. My parent's also think I'm being unfair and childish.\n\nI wanted to check AITA?\n\nEdit: Forgot to add  The reason Mindy is invited is because she and I are very close. My brother and I have a huge age difference (I'm adopted btw) of 20 years and she was there for 10 years of my life (5-15). She is to me more like a sister than a SIL.\n\nI told him he's free to decline the invite, but he doesn't want to and wants me to accommodate Lisa and Liz\n\n Lisa doesn't like because I'm very close to Mindy. I invite her(Mindy) to really important stuff (my 18 birthday, My College graduation, and a few of my birthdays (21 and 25)) and Lisa always complains and asks me to uninvite her and when I refuse she gets upset ", "created_utc": 1683615822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ci866/aita_for_excluding_my_brothers_step_daughter_and/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the same time your brother is allowed to want his family to come, and he's also allowerd to not go to the wedding if his family can't go.", "NAH-\n\nIm firm in the rule of its your wedding and you can invite or disinvite who you want. Its your day and you should be with the people you want to be there no matter what.\n\nBut you brother has the right to be upset that his current wife and family are excluded. Your choice if you change your mind or not, personally if they dont like you i wouldn't have invited them either. \ud83e\udd37 just isnt a shock if your brother is upset. You could be upfront an tell him why.", "NTA\n\n It's your wedding. Why would you have people who aren't happy for you there? Your ex sil is still the mother of your children and lisa's jealousy is not your burden to carry. She shouldn't have married a divorced dad if she was upset at dealing with an ex wife at events that have nothing to do with her.", "INFO: Am I understanding correctly, that you invited his ex-wife but not his current wife?", "INFO: you said you could understand why Lisa doesn't like you. Why is that?\n\nAlso, how old is Liz?", "NTA - it is your wedding so it is your choice! Unless they\u2019re contributing money which they aren\u2019t then they don\u2019t get a say. But expect drama for inviting your brother\u2019s ex and her family. That\u2019s just asking for conflict. It\u2019s your wedding so it\u2019s your day - you don\u2019t have to invite someone who hates you and if you have any proof of that such as messages etc. then you need to show your parents and brother.", "NTA.\n\nKnee jerk reaction is that inviting one half of a married couple but not the other is rude.\n\nHowever, after reading the entire situation, I think your actions are justified.\n\nYour brothers wife has tried to force you to exclude his ex from your life. You are very close with his ex. Brothers wife is now toxic towards you for refusing to cut people out of your life because she tells you to? Go kick rocks lady.", "I\u2019m really torn! But ultimately I think I\u2019m leaning gently towards YTA. It\u2019s generally really rude not to invite someone\u2019s wife! And it puts your brother in a very awkward position\u2026does he support his wife or his sister? It also put your parents in a weird position, too. Family dynamics are tough! And it also ensures you and Lisa and Liza NEVER have a cordial relationship if you exclude them from your wedding now. \n\nIf you posted this on the weddingplanning or wedding shaming subreddits you\u2019d get very different answers than here. Because while we\u2019d all totally get why you don\u2019t want to invite her, we\u2019d also acknowledge it\u2019s pretty rude not to invite her. \n\n(I don\u2019t really think you\u2019re an asshole at all, but I do lean you should invite them for the good of your brother, parents, yourself and future family dynamics).", "NTA. They dislike you for some reason, so why should you invite them? I think it's a little unfair that you invited his first wife to the wedding, but that's just my opinion", "NTA. Its your day, & as long as your fiance is on board, you should do it how you want. But am i understanding this right, your brothers got 4 kids & a stepkid, and youre inviting the 4 kids, & your sil from his 1st marriage, but not his current wife? My brother would be pissed at me, too. Actually, my brother would not be invited, but his ex - my sil - would.

It's his wife.", "NTA, its your wedding and as you mentioned, you only need people who likes you and wants to share the happiness to be there. Don't think either Lisa or Liz will be missed. You don't need to justify. Tell your brother its your wedding and not his and when he gets married he get to choose who he wants to invite.", "Wait, you explicitly stated on the wedding invitation that two members of his family are not invited, but the others are? YTA. Not inviting people you think hate you makes sense, but to invite only part of his family and single out the other part is mind bogglingly awful.", "Its bad manners to invite half of a couple to a wedding. And if your brother shares his life and his home with his stepdaughter then you are being far less than polite.\n\nUnfortunately, YTA. You should not ask your brother to go against his family to show you support on your wedding day. And incidentally, your brother's wife and stepdaughter are his family too. Your brother should decline the invitation if he can't supplement your budget and help you, though. He should not hound you about changing your guest list because that's him being rude and an a-hole right back.", "NTA + there is really no need for this much explaining, your wedding = your rules. It\u2019s not your brother\u2019s wedding so he doesn\u2019t get to vote. The end.", "This is nasty. But NTA. Your bro knows they don\u2019t like.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding and you shouldn\u2019t feel forced to invite people who will intentionally bring down your day. The issue isn\u2019t that they want to attend the wedding the issue is that they want your brother to pick them over you. If he didn\u2019t cause a stink they would be mad at him instead. You\u2019re in a pretty crappy situation family wise but in no way are you an asshole for avoiding people who would be hateful to you on your wedding day simply for inviting an important person in your life. Your brother getting remained doesn\u2019t erase Mindy from everyone\u2019s lives. First they had kids together so she will be around..second she came into your life 5.. you are 25 that\u2019s 80% of your life\u2026they can get over themselves.", "NTA. You can invite who you want to your wedding. You knew Mandy when you were 5-15 so it seems you view her as a older sister then ex sil.", "YTA\n\nYou're basically forcing your brother to choose between going to your wedding or staying at home with his wife and kids.", "YTA\n\n  \n\n\nOnly inviting parts of a family is asking for trouble.\n\n  \n\n\nAlso I'm confused,\n\n\\- So Mindy and her 2 children are invited\n\n  \n\n\n\\- Liz and Lisa aren't invited, but what about Lisa's other 2 children with your brother, are they invited?", "nta - but u could suggest then he pay for his wife and stepdaughter to attend and if he gets outraged too bad becuase paying for ppl that hate u is crazy and he can pay for that.", "NTA your wedding your choice... if people have a issue then exclude then as well.. u know your budget how many people and what size wedding u will like... brother needs to just not go and anyone that's complaining....\nPeople have alot to day until its them in the situation", "YTA", "It's a pickle for sure but 'normal' expectations would be that if you're having children and you're having both Mindy and Josh that they are regarded separately and your guest list should be \n\nJosh, +1, +3 kids\n\nAND\n\nMindy, +1, + 2 kids\n\nYou can save some money by disinviting the kids but you really should have your brother's wife there and not just his ex-wife. \n\nYou can invite/disinvite whomever you wish but actions have consequences and I don't know if you've thought through the ramifications of creating so much ill-feeling via your wedding. It's supposed to be a happy time where families come together, not get split irredeemably apart. \n\nYTA", "Yes YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he wants to not come, that's his choice, but don't invite them and I'd even go low to no contact moving forward.", "Hi, OP. \n\nIf you're grown up enough to get married, you're grown up enough to make independent decisions regarding your private life. The fact that your brother is trying to tell you what to do and that you're coming here for validation/judgement, tells me that you have a low confidence and depend on others for their opinion. That's something that you need to work on. Also, you don't have to maintain contact with controlling and miserable members of your extended family. Just saying.\n\nIf asked for my advice, I'd suggest that you tell your brother that he doesn't get to decide on the matter and if he keeps acting like a spoilt brat who wants it his way or high way, he'll be uninvited, too. Too much drama before your special day, no?\n\nNTA", "NTA you free to invite who you want, however your brother is going to show up with his wife and stepdaughter.
