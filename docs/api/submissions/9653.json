Eggs now cost over $5 per dozen.   I used to able to get eggs pretty cheaply, so boiling a dozen eggs wasn't a big deal.  Now they cost more than a gallon of gas or a gallon of milk (both of which can last longer).\n\nSo yes, you are hurting someone.  At $5 every two days, you are costing your family $75 to $100 additional dollars per month for the grocery bill.\n\nI also cut down on how many eggs that I buy, as groceries are much higher than they used to be.  So the grocery bill is at least 25% higher, and if you buy some foods, the grocery bill can be much more.  Hamburger is now an expensive meat, as are eggs.  So I had to swap to other things to be able to feed everyone.\n\nAnd by consuming so many eggs (which are necessary to make many types of foods, like breads, cakes, etc.), you are literally costing your family other things.\n\nSo yes, you are hurting others.  You are eating what is now an expensive food instead of eating the food that is prepared for the whole family.   You don't have to eat the same thing as everyone else.  But you do have to eat what is within the grocery budget.  \n\nI have a kid that is also a picky eater, and I fix some dinners that we all eat and some that she is not a fan.  But she doesn't wreck my grocery budget by costing another $100 per month in additional food.  \n\nModeration is the key.  Don't eat the last couple of eggs when others also need them.

Did you know that eating so many eggs is  unhealthy? You won't notice anything while you're young, but you are setting yourself up for heart disease etc. Most guidelines say you can eat 5-7 eggs per week, and you eat that potentially per day!   \nApart from the fact that eating this many eggs is not sustainable for your health, it is also not sustainable for your mom's wallet. They are expensive! You and your mom should have a talk about your diet, you should learn about protein and what to eat to stay healthy. Maybe go vegetarian if you don't like meat. But not eating anything is another really dumb idea.", "Are you able to house maybe 10 chickens? That will give you your daily egg quota.", "Are you neurodivergent?

You still have a safe food, but not putting as much hassle on your mom, who pays for it.\n\nAlso, you say that she OFFERS to make you anything else you want. That is very gracious of her.

Ask mom what your your part of the grocery budget is and see if you can take that money, buy and make all your own food.  Then it\u2019s your problem how to eat on a budget.

Besides the insane cost of eggs I also wonder if you are cleaning up after you cook. Having two meals cooked at the same time twice a day can mean a lot of dishes which makes no one happy. You need to work on finding a way to compromise while someone else is paying your food bill wether that be only eating side dishes, offering to cook a couple nights a week for the family or something else. I would also like to know what you are eating at school for lunch.", "Hey honey,\n\nDon't be too hard on your parents they are probably really stressed because the price of food has gone through the roof. Eggs used to be really cheap but now they are considered expensive for what they are.\n\nI am also a picky eater so I can easily sympathize with you on that.\n\nTry looking for a part-time job in fast food, dishwasher, grocery store, etc. \n\nThe only reason I bring up getting a part-time job is so you can simply keep the peace. You can buy eggs for yourself and whatever else you may want to eat. Mom and Dad won't be able to complain. \n\nBut this will also teach you how much food really costs on a minimum wage budget. Try your mom's cooking here and there. I mean you never know until you try it. If you don't like it once you've tried it simply move on to the next recipe.

No trying to cut down on eggs, no trying to separate the food at dinner, no getting a part time job, no explaining of the family budget and grocery store receipts.\n\nEggs prices were hit really hard recently, so your comment to your mom sounds really tone deaf. She probably would have been more receptive if you actually talked about the budget and come with some areas to cut back on. You basically told her that inflation happens and she just needs to suck it up. That\u2019s not how budgets work.\n\nLikewise, your mom issuing an ultimatum was not helpful and eroded any conversation between you two. She basically threatened you to eat her food or else. No compromises there.\n\nI have 2 picky eaters myself and I can say that cooking for them is super frustrating. I often have to make extra meals, wash more dishes, and spent more time in the kitchen than I want to. It\u2019s also super demoralizing when they don\u2019t eat the food I prepare. So we compromised that they will eat 2 bites of my food and then they can eat whatever they want. That\u2019s what worked for us.\n\nI also have a husband that likes snacking and will sometimes snack on food all night. So that mozzarella cheese that I was saving for a recipe is unexpectedly gone in morning. Super frustrating when you go the fridge and it\u2019s not there when it was purchased one day ago. Especially when I was psyching myself to cook something I like.

If you choose not to address it and just keep eating a now excessive portion of your family\u2019s grocery budget, then you could potentially be TA. Also, keep in mind that sometimes people (especially picky eaters) have to try foods 10-12 times before deciding they actually do like them.

I assure you that there\u2019s a whole culinary world out there and eating meat with rice or in soup is not the only ways to eat meat. \n\nIf chicken eggs are too expensive right now, what about other options/substitutes, like vegan egg substitutes? Are there any types of breads, beans/legumes, and/or whole grains (e.g. oatmeal/porridge/grits, etc.) you can enjoy (or at least tolerate until eggs are less expensive)?\n\nPersonally, I think you should try to work with your parents\u2019 budget, and be a little flexible\u2026 unless it\u2019s related to a serious food sensitivity.

I am also a picky eater, but it was way worse as a kid and even worse as a teenager. The hardest time in my life to eat was when I was 13-17. I wanted to eat other foods other than the few things I could eat. It all looked good. Smelled good sounded good. But it's like my brain wouldn't let me eat it. The mere action of bringing food to my mouth that wasn't on the safe list made me physically ill, in my stomach and in my body. \n\nI had maybe 1 or 2 dinners I would be able to eat with the family and if they weren't for dinner that night it would either be plain rice or lunch meat by its self for dinner or nothing. Cereal with no milk for breakfast. And nothing for lunch. Not even at school. I was so hungry all the time. I wanted to eat so bad but it was debilitating to try to eat something different. If I was made to try something different and it made me I'll I couldn't eat for hours after.\n\nMy mom and dad pulled the same crap on me because I would eat all the cereal and lunch meat in the house and we were on food stamps at the time. So what was on the food stamps was all we had for the month for groceries. I starved for nearly a year. I was not alowed to get a part time job and earn my own money or my parents would take all my money from me. I was not alowed to go to friends house for dinner or stays because then they would know we were poor. \n\nAt 13 when it first started I weighed 115 lbs. At 15 when it was the worst I weighed 104 lbs and got 4 inches taller. \n\nI was not being picky just because I was difficult. I wanted to eat other foods so bad but I would get so sick to my stomach. Got tested for allergies, all negative. Got taken to a specialist and the school called me into a meeting because a teacher saw how frail I was. They believed me. My mom told my counselor I was just attention seeking and acting like \"a little bitch\" to spite her. \n\nOP I don't know if you have difficulties eating in the same way I did. But it was hard for me to be called picky and difficult and attention seeking. Food is hard. At 29 I'm still sorta picky but it's not as debilitating now.
