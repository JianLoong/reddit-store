Eggs now cost over $5 per dozen.   I used to able to get eggs pretty cheaply, so boiling a dozen eggs wasn't a big deal.  Now they cost more than a gallon of gas or a gallon of milk (both of which can last longer).\n\nSo yes, you are hurting someone.  At $5 every two days, you are costing your family $75 to $100 additional dollars per month for the grocery bill.\n\nI also cut down on how many eggs that I buy, as groceries are much higher than they used to be.  So the grocery bill is at least 25% higher, and if you buy some foods, the grocery bill can be much more.  Hamburger is now an expensive meat, as are eggs.  So I had to swap to other things to be able to feed everyone.\n\nAnd by consuming so many eggs (which are necessary to make many types of foods, like breads, cakes, etc.), you are literally costing your family other things.\n\nSo yes, you are hurting others.  You are eating what is now an expensive food instead of eating the food that is prepared for the whole family.   You don't have to eat the same thing as everyone else.  But you do have to eat what is within the grocery budget.  \n\nI have a kid that is also a picky eater, and I fix some dinners that we all eat and some that she is not a fan.  But she doesn't wreck my grocery budget by costing another $100 per month in additional food.  \n\nModeration is the key.  Don't eat the last couple of eggs when others also need them.

Did you know that eating so many eggs is  unhealthy? You won't notice anything while you're young, but you are setting yourself up for heart disease etc. Most guidelines say you can eat 5-7 eggs per week, and you eat that potentially per day!   \nApart from the fact that eating this many eggs is not sustainable for your health, it is also not sustainable for your mom's wallet. They are expensive! You and your mom should have a talk about your diet, you should learn about protein and what to eat to stay healthy. Maybe go vegetarian if you don't like meat.

You still have a safe food, but not putting as much hassle on your mom, who pays for it.\n\nAlso, you say that she OFFERS to make you anything else you want. That is very gracious of her.

Ask mom what your your part of the grocery budget is and see if you can take that money, buy and make all your own food.  Then it\u2019s your problem how to eat on a budget.

Besides the insane cost of eggs I also wonder if you are cleaning up after you cook. Having two meals cooked at the same time twice a day can mean a lot of dishes which makes no one happy. You need to work on finding a way to compromise while someone else is paying your food bill wether that be only eating side dishes, offering to cook a couple nights a week for the family or something else. I would also like to know what you are eating at school for lunch.", "Hey honey,\n\nDon't be too hard on your parents they are probably really stressed because the price of food has gone through the roof. Eggs used to be really cheap but now they are considered expensive for what they are.\n\nI am also a picky eater so I can easily sympathize with you on that.\n\nTry looking for a part-time job in fast food, dishwasher, grocery store, etc. \n\nThe only reason I bring up getting a part-time job is so you can simply keep the peace. You can buy eggs for yourself and whatever else you may want to eat. Mom and Dad won't be able to complain. \n\nBut this will also teach you how much food really costs on a minimum wage budget. Try your mom's cooking here and there. I mean you never know until you try it. If you don't like it once you've tried it simply move on to the next recipe.

No trying to cut down on eggs, no trying to separate the food at dinner, no getting a part time job, no explaining of the family budget and grocery store receipts.\n\nEggs prices were hit really hard recently, so your comment to your mom sounds really tone deaf. She probably would have been more receptive if you actually talked about the budget and come with some areas to cut back on. You basically told her that inflation happens and she just needs to suck it up. That\u2019s not how budgets work.\n\nLikewise, your mom issuing an ultimatum was not helpful and eroded any conversation between you two. She basically threatened you to eat her food or else. No compromises there.\n\nI have 2 picky eaters myself and I can say that cooking for them is super frustrating. I often have to make extra meals, wash more dishes, and spent more time in the kitchen than I want to. It\u2019s also super demoralizing when they don\u2019t eat the food I prepare. So we compromised that they will eat 2 bites of my food and then they can eat whatever they want. That\u2019s what worked for us.\n\nI also have a husband that likes snacking and will sometimes snack on food all night. So that mozzarella cheese that I was saving for a recipe is unexpectedly gone in morning. Super frustrating when you go the fridge and it\u2019s not there when it was purchased one day ago. Especially when I was psyching myself to cook something I like.

If you choose not to address it and just keep eating a now excessive portion of your family\u2019s grocery budget, then you could potentially be TA.

I didn't make any conscious changes to my diet except for replacing one of those eggs with liquid eggs (which has zero cholesterol in them). Now my cholesterol is within normal range.", "[deleted]", "Agree, expand your palate. Your body will thank you in addition to your parent.", "If he doesn't eat what then?", "My gosh I cannot stand adult picky eaters that don\u2019t eat certain foods. Health and religious reasons are really easy to accommodate for.\n\nBut the \u201c I don\u2019t eat any fruit or vegetables\u201d gets old fast. Had a coworker with me on a trip to rural China and the guy was not eating for days, eating only eggs and the occasional British hash brown they offered at breakfast. So hard to travel with someone like that and we are friends.", "Eggs are not expensive, rather they\u2019re expensive compared to what they were. Overall they are still cheaper than a full healthy meal that his mom is cooking.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the cooking. I think it has more to do with the price of eggs now and how OP goes through a dozen every other day.", "OPs mom offered to cook anything else they wanted for them aside from eggs. I think that\u2019s a generous compromise. OP just refuses to eat anything but eggs. I\u2019d also be concerned about nutrient deficiencies if all they are eating is eggs and pickles. I can\u2019t say the mom sucks here", "But until that point where they (hopefully) get a taste for a wider variety, they could get really sick if it's a food avoidance issue.", "Came here to second this!! That, regardless everything else you read here, in would be in your (OP) best interest to research ARFID. It\u2019s a real and serious thing and you can get treatment for it.  I have struggled with it my whole life.", "Re: 2 - You're wrong, and I say this as a former professional editor and logophile. Any good dictionary will tell you that \"nauseous\" means both \"causing nausea\" and \"affected with nausea\" (i.e. nauseated, as per OP's usage). If you're going to nitpick someone's language usage, at least be correct. Many words have more than one standard meaning; \"nauseous\" is one of them.", "I think you mean the eggspense of his eggcessive egg consumption.", "His basic needs are more than being met. His mother is cooking and offering food to him, he\u2019s just not on board with even attempting to expand his palate.", "He's welcome to starve", "Except mom literally said she would make him whatever else he wanted, just not eggs. She\u2019s not forcing him to eat things he doesn\u2019t like. She\u2019s not forcing him to do more work to make other food for himself. And she\u2019s not forcing him to pay for all of his food, just if he wants to continue consuming the insane amount of eggs he currently eats.", "Eating only eggs is an eating disorder which can be overcome.", "Where I live in the US egg prices sky rocketed compared to what they were. Still cheaper than most meats you can buy where I\u2019m at, but tripled in cost from previous years. For a dozen eggs it\u2019s about $6 and change. Where as before it was $2 and change. They say it\u2019s because of some bird flu I guess I dunno", "They about tripled where I live.", "There's a bird flu problem thats really pushing prices up. For us, a dozen costs over $5 right now. With the amount OP eats, they would need the big box that comes with 64? I think and that's over $25 here. If OP is eating 3 at breakfast and probably 3 at dinner, that's a dozen eggs in two days.", "Eggs increased percent wise more than others but no way is it now more expensive than what he is subbing it for", "What if he only ate lobster and caviar? Should his parents be forced to provide that? How about wagu beef? This kid needs to deal with his eating disorder.", "The cholesterol alone ;d", "But he belongs to a family and they have to eat as well and cutting back in on eggs is smart if they have a whole family to feed. An additional cost for eggs means they have to cut back elsewhere to keep the same grocery cost. Everyone suffers if they can afford less food.", "the problem here though is that it\u2019s on top of food that\u2019s already cooked for the household", "Depending where he is the price could be looking more like $4-5/d on eggs alone.  That's $28-35/wk (120-150/mo) which could be a lot for 1 person in a family grocery budget. I get being a picky eater but compromise is key. What else non-meat protein could be be okay eating that might be more budget friendly? Or if OP can't fathom eating anything but eggs, get a job or find a farmer to sell them bulk at a good price?", "yes, that\u2019s why I say \u201ctoo many eggs is not a good thing long term\u201d, kid sounds so clueless that I doubt he ever heard the word cholesterol before \ud83d\ude02", "God knows what else he is doing to his body without vege or fruits.....", "OP is eating a dozen (plus) eggs every 2 days. On their own. That doesn\u2019t even include the rest of the family and their needs.", "But who's eating 5-7 steaks, burgers, etc. a day?", "I can get about 2-3lbs of chicken breast for what it costs for a dozen eggs around here right now.", "What does that have to do with anything?", "Then he will end up in the hospital with a nutrition drip. OP doesn't seem that clueless.", "If he is eating 3 eggs twice a day, thats not cheaper then rice, soup or a piece of chicken in my area.  It's like $6 for 12 eggs at the store here, which would do him 2 days.  Its extra money as he wont eat what everyone else is. $6 can make a meal for 4 quite easily.", "Seriously, eggs aren't cheap as they used to be but if they're instead of meat, they're not terrible.", "This is the \"sure if you have to buy everything from scratch\" argument.\n\nMy meals cost a lot...if I have to go to the store and buy every ingredient on my list. But I have a store-cupboard and a freezer so frequently its just the fresh veg. Eggs need to be bought fresh.", "I think there's more to it. He's cooking and cleaning up after himself.", "yup", "Missed that detail where she said she would make him anything besides eggs. I thought she was doing the \u201cyou\u2019ll eat what I make no matter what\u201d thing. Thanks for pointing that out, I deleted my comment since I no longer think it\u2019s a correct assessment of the situation.", "Wow, that\u2019s intense!", "That\u2019s really bad. I came to the comments ready to be like NTA, eggs are a normal food and people were comparing it to lobster, which completely confused me", "Yeah kid should probably see a doctor.", "If they cut out the only thing op eats he will have to eat something else that he can tolerate and that will provide the staying power of eggs. Meat is more expensive than eggs. Veggies burn off more quickly and won\u2019t keep him as full. He says he can\u2019t eat rice. Why should the whole family get meat while OP gets neither meat nor eggs?", "Cutting back on the main part of OP\u2019s diet means he has to eat something else, so the cost will increase elsewhere. He\u2019s not going to go from eggs to something much cheaper that will keep him going like eggs do.", "It's also a food that's hard to buy ahead. Meat goes up? Eh, freezer will keep us going for a bit. Eggs go up? Or they're just hard to find? You can freeze them but they're not the nicest that way.", "It\u2019s not though. Say there\u2019s 6 people in the house. 5 get chicken, 1 gets eggs. Otherwise you\u2019d have to provide 6 servings of chicken. Chicken is more expensive than eggs.", "Yeah and when it could be avoided since he's cooking and cleaning up after himself\n\n\nA child shouldn't have to pay for food even if it eggs. Food a basic need", "You accused his mother of abuse. That\u2019s not correct.", "I will say that at least where I live it\u2019s been fluctuating a bit. Like I think it was around August or so they really sky rocketed then supposedly the flu got better or something so they went down (not before prices but lower than the highest price), but now they are up again because they say there is another outbreak.", "Yeah I'm glad it's not like that for you, though! So many things require eggs and they're just too expensive.", "But OP is choosing not to eat when food is already made.  OPs mom is buying and making enough for everybody for meals.  So she is buying and cooking that food regardless.  But then OP is wanting something else after the fact. Which is costing more.\n\nIt's not like she is at the store spending x per person and OP choosing eggs is cheaper.  She is paying x per meal or x per week. And then OP decides he wants an increasingly expensive alternative onto of what she is making regardless.", "I disagree I can get chicken for $0.69-$2 a pound, eggs are $5-8 here depending what they have in stock for a dozen.", "5 people share a cost of chicken, one person eats 5$ worth of eggs a day, what\u2019s so hard to calculate? they do not eat 5x 5$ of chicken, because even if chicken is more expensive, it\u2019s not one per each person like 5$ of eggs are for this kid", "So what if a child only would eat caviar and wagu beef? Should a parent provide that? He needs to work through this eating disorder.", "Forcing a kid to eat then not refusing to let him eat is abuse. How eating disorders are created. This kid cooking for himself Evsn if it just eggs he eating she should be happy. A doctor would tell her that. \n\n\nYes forcing a kid to get w job for food is abuse. Especially for something like eggs\n\n\n\nI'm willing to bet he has autism that was overlooked to. That y he only eats eggs because of sensory issues..", "She should be buying and cooking according to what will be eaten. If she\u2019s cooking chicken for OP and ends up throwing it out day after day while he\u2019s eating eggs then yes, that would be a waste. But why would she cook him food she knows he\u2019s not going to eat? If other family members are eating OP\u2019s share of the meat then it\u2019s THEY who are costing more to feed, not OP.", "That\u2019s a tad on the dramatic side.", "I honestly understand that beef like that more  expensive then eggs. Chicken more expensive then eggs an entire meal more expensive then eggs. I don't think he has an eating disorder I think he has a form of autism that causes sensory issues with foods. My sister has autism only certain foods she will eat. As a parent his mom should be happy he is eating.  Every household has eggs its basic on a grocery list it should be provided If they just don't wanna  buy eggs.  I don't think it's an eating disorder he could have autism and his parents haven't had him checked or ignore it.", "She\u2019s not forcing him to get a job for food. She\u2019s offering loads of food. She suggested he get a job to cover the one expensive thing he consumes vast amounts of without letting the rest of house have any.", "THIS IS THE COMMENT I WAS LOOKING FOR! Everyone is so freaking harsh on this 16 year old without considering other things.", "This!!!!\n\nOh my, I'm investigating if I have autism. My psychologist was suspicious because I have the same problem with food. Sometimes, it's not about being \"picky eater\"..", "But the rest of the house is eating what she cooks that he doesn't want. Chicken more expensive then eggs in most places so is beef.", "They aren't gonna look at other things because they think he's being entitled", "My sister is picky bc of her autism so we ask her what she wants for dinner if she don't like it she doesn't eat it but fixes her Ramen or a sandwich.\n\n\nPlease a lot of autism gets overlooked by parents", "That\u2019s so freaking sad.", "My autism was overlooked by parents\u2026 I am not too picky (which it\u2019s so different for each person) but I have my safe foods and lucky enough to have a boyfriend who loves me for who I am. It\u2019s been a limited spoons week and We\u2019ve had beans and rice for dinner almost every night because that\u2019s all that sounds good to me! He would totally voice it if it wasn\u2019t ok to him too btw.", "My sister eats pasta potatoes most meats. We tend to stick to that \n\nShe doesn't like Mexican food seafood cheese sticks or sweets hardly. I think because of the texture. Beans like Northern and pinto beans She hates won't touch. But lately her sensory issues kicking in because she'll eat very little of somethings but will eat Ramen. The doctor says her  system changing as long as she eats it's OK. \n\nIt's not that hard to ask the child what they'd like for dinner never force one to eat. I have an eating problem where if I'll eat something even if I don't like it thanks to my mothers in laws and my grandma on my dad side when I was a toddler they make me finish what was on my plate even if I don't like it. So I can't say no because I'll feel bad so I'll suck it up and eat even if it makes me sick bc I don't like it"]}
