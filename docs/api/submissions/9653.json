Eggs now cost over $5 per dozen.   I used to able to get eggs pretty cheaply, so boiling a dozen eggs wasn't a big deal.  Now they cost more than a gallon of gas or a gallon of milk (both of which can last longer).\n\nSo yes, you are hurting someone.  At $5 every two days, you are costing your family $75 to $100 additional dollars per month for the grocery bill.\n\nI also cut down on how many eggs that I buy, as groceries are much higher than they used to be.  So the grocery bill is at least 25% higher, and if you buy some foods, the grocery bill can be much more.  Hamburger is now an expensive meat, as are eggs.  So I had to swap to other things to be able to feed everyone.\n\nAnd by consuming so many eggs (which are necessary to make many types of foods, like breads, cakes, etc.), you are literally costing your family other things.\n\nSo yes, you are hurting others.  You are eating what is now an expensive food instead of eating the food that is prepared for the whole family.   You don't have to eat the same thing as everyone else.  But you do have to eat what is within the grocery budget.  \n\nI have a kid that is also a picky eater, and I fix some dinners that we all eat and some that she is not a fan.  But she doesn't wreck my grocery budget by costing another $100 per month in additional food.  \n\nModeration is the key.  Don't eat the last couple of eggs when others also need them.

Did you know that eating so many eggs is  unhealthy? You won't notice anything while you're young, but you are setting yourself up for heart disease etc. Most guidelines say you can eat 5-7 eggs per week, and you eat that potentially per day!   \nApart from the fact that eating this many eggs is not sustainable for your health, it is also not sustainable for your mom's wallet. They are expensive! You and your mom should have a talk about your diet, you should learn about protein and what to eat to stay healthy. Maybe go vegetarian if you don't like meat. But not eating anything is another really dumb idea.", "Are you able to house maybe 10 chickens? That will give you your daily egg quota.", "Are you neurodivergent?

Haha) \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, but a little naive about food costs. Maybe instead of cutting eggs completely, try reducing the number and adding some other things to it. You still have a safe food, but not putting as much hassle on your mom, who pays for it.\n\nAlso, you say that she OFFERS to make you anything else you want. That is very gracious of her.

Ask mom what your your part of the grocery budget is and see if you can take that money, buy and make all your own food.  Then it\u2019s your problem how to eat on a budget.

Besides the insane cost of eggs I also wonder if you are cleaning up after you cook. Having two meals cooked at the same time twice a day can mean a lot of dishes which makes no one happy. You need to work on finding a way to compromise while someone else is paying your food bill wether that be only eating side dishes, offering to cook a couple nights a week for the family or something else. I would also like to know what you are eating at school for lunch.", "Hey honey,\n\nDon't be too hard on your parents they are probably really stressed because the price of food has gone through the roof. Eggs used to be really cheap but now they are considered expensive for what they are.\n\nI am also a picky eater so I can easily sympathize with you on that.\n\nTry looking for a part-time job in fast food, dishwasher, grocery store, etc. \n\nThe only reason I bring up getting a part-time job is so you can simply keep the peace. You can buy eggs for yourself and whatever else you may want to eat. Mom and Dad won't be able to complain. \n\nBut this will also teach you how much food really costs on a minimum wage budget. Try your mom's cooking here and there. I mean you never know until you try it. If you don't like it once you've tried it simply move on to the next recipe.

No trying to cut down on eggs, no trying to separate the food at dinner, no getting a part time job, no explaining of the family budget and grocery store receipts.\n\nEggs prices were hit really hard recently, so your comment to your mom sounds really tone deaf. She probably would have been more receptive if you actually talked about the budget and come with some areas to cut back on. You basically told her that inflation happens and she just needs to suck it up. That\u2019s not how budgets work.\n\nLikewise, your mom issuing an ultimatum was not helpful and eroded any conversation between you two. She basically threatened you to eat her food or else. No compromises there.\n\nI have 2 picky eaters myself and I can say that cooking for them is super frustrating. I often have to make extra meals, wash more dishes, and spent more time in the kitchen than I want to. It\u2019s also super demoralizing when they don\u2019t eat the food I prepare. So we compromised that they will eat 2 bites of my food and then they can eat whatever they want. That\u2019s what worked for us.\n\nI also have a husband that likes snacking and will sometimes snack on food all night. So that mozzarella cheese that I was saving for a recipe is unexpectedly gone in morning. Super frustrating when you go the fridge and it\u2019s not there when it was purchased one day ago. Especially when I was psyching myself to cook something I like.

If you choose not to address it and just keep eating a now excessive portion of your family\u2019s grocery budget, then you could potentially be TA. Also, keep in mind that sometimes people (especially picky eaters) have to try foods 10-12 times before deciding they actually do like them.

Guess the Easter Bunny painting potatoes this year!", "And also get that store discount on his eggs!", "Exactly what I was thinking-this is more than picky eating. Definitely sounds like sensory issues to me. Nothing wrong with that, but it absolutely needs to be addressed and acknowledged. Hopefully OP can find some other meals to work into the rotation-maybe roasted veggies and a protein shake or something? Sensory issues can be absolute hell, especially if nobody realizes what\u2019s up. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what\u2019s being served you can make yourself a sandwich\u201d is definitely a reasonable mealtime rule; hopefully OP won\u2019t be forced into eating meals they truly can\u2019t stomach.", "I agree. A friend's child didn't like eating certain foods and had a lot of health issues.  Later, they had him tested comprehensively for allergies.

If you know you go through so many eggs you buy several dozen at once. Totally understand cost of living is skyrocketing. At the end of the day, I think OP needs to see a nutritionist.

The food is not required or requested to be provided.\n\nOPs parent can save money buying less of expensive food, and has to provide zero additional effort. In fact OPs parent can prepare smaller meals and spend less time on meal prep.\n\nI cannot fathom how this isn't extremely clear cut and simple.\n\nI cooked my own meals from when I was 8, My mother didn't care because it made her life easier.", "I believe this to some extent, but I'm gonna say 5-7 eggs a day every day forever is gonna be outside the healthy range of MOST people.", "Not that it really changes the argument, but he does say in the OP that he also likes vegetables.", "> I don't like meat or chicken but I do like **vegetables** and eggs.", "Were you by any chance cooking and eating your eggs with butter?

Even expensive eggs are a great value, as a snack or a meal.", "OP doesn\u2019t really eat meat.", "None of those have any protein besides cheese.

OPs mom is buying and making enough for everybody for meals. So she is buying and cooking that food regardless. But then OP is wanting something else after the fact. Which is costing more.\n\nThere are a few things wrong with that\n\n1# She isn't making enough for everybodies meals if OP isn't eating them, she is making too much and can make most likely make less.\n\n2# Fridges and Freezers exist, if it's not practical to make less for whatever reason, That food can be preserved and used later.\n\nEither way the impact on the budget is limited to the difference in cost between eggs and the usual meals.

That's not how buying food works right now. I mean, unless you think she should be opening pre-packaged meat in the store and only buying three porkchops instead of the package of four.", "I don't understand where you're getting the ideas than the cost of OP ALONE eating a carton of eggs a day if not more is somehow balanced by them not eating the meals provided by the mom.", "Pasta with protein is more expensive.", "It doesn\u2019t matter. I buy eggs that are $8.99 a dozen even though I have much cheaper options. That\u2019s $1.50 for two eggs and that is not expensive.

There's a difference between a family meal made for four or five, and ONE person costing the household 100$ a month.
