She told everyone in the friend group that she is sick with something that she doesn't even know the name of but she's also pregnant. Two weeks before school ended she told me that she had a miscarriage and that's she was really upset about it. I started getting a bit suspicious because her boyfriend lives in Texas. So yesterday she told me that she had just had to kids (twins) and I know that she is lying. Because 4 weeks to have a kid doesn't seem like something that is even possible and I'm very sure it isn't. Today she sent me a picture of her kids. To try to ease my supsitions I reversed googled it and found out easily it wasn't her picture or her children. I feel really bad because I know she's going through something but lying isn't something I tolerate at all especially about childrens health to get attention.

Your friend needs serious, serious help. Like, there is something mentally wrong with her. Also FYI it takes about 9 months to develop a baby. Don't \"call her out\" just go directly to your parents and tell them there is something bad going on in your friends life and you need to get her adult help.", "NTA.\n\nI hate to say it, but lies like this are pretty serious. This might be worth speaking to your school psychologist over because it sounds like she could some help, one way or another.", "NTA. However, you need to proceed with caution. Clearly she's not doing well. Try talking with her first and suggest therapy. If she doesn't listen, talk to whoever you think would be best: her parents, siblings, boyfriend, a friend if she's closer with someone else than with you.", "NTA\n\nBut be very gentle. If she was pregnant and had a miscarriage, she could be in depression or having a breakdown. These kinds of 'lies' arent normal and she may need some psychiatric help.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nYour friend is mentally ill and struggling with something. While she is clearly not telling the truth, it is also clear that this isn't just a case of her lying for funsies or to be manipulative. She may be dealing with a psychotic break brought on by the miscarriage, or other serious mental health or hormonal issues. Either way, this is WAY more than you should be dealing with as a teenager, and you \"calling her out\" or attacking her in any way could make it far, far worse. \n\nI suggest that you speak to your parents, to her parents if you know them and think that they are loving and supportive (i.e. not abusive or neglectful), or to a counsellor at school, and let them know that your friend has been talking about having been pregnant and giving a variety of different stories about what happened with her pregnancy (miscarriage, twins, etc.), and that you are very worried about her mental health and you think an adult needs to get involved. \n\nEither way, please don't \"call her out\". While she may not be telling the truth, this is a lot more complicated than someone just telling stories for attention. Your friend needs professional, adult help, not judgement or accusations.", "The reason people lie about things like this is generally they are in pain and don't know how to give voice to the reasons behind what is actually bothering them.  Your friend is likely going through some kind of mental disturbance.  Perhaps she did have a miscarriage, or there is something going on in her home life etc.  \n\nI think it would be ok to privately tell her you realized that she is going through very big things and ask how you can support her.  I wouldn't talk to her parents in case the issue is at home.  But, I would talk to a guidance counsellor or trusted adult you know.  Your friend isn't doing this just to seek attention, she is troubled.", "NTA, you need to have a frank discussion with her.  Do not call her a liar, just mentioned that you find it hard believing she is pregnant.", "Yikes. NTA", "I would speak with her privately she's probably grieving her miscarriage and trying to conceptualise the pregnancy she lost. It's a wierd one and a sensitive one, but tbh it's probably a means for looking for help and support. But tbf she shouldn't have lied in the first place and it's a very odd thing to fib about particularly the twins aspect.", "NTA but you need to be careful about this, it seems to me that she's had a miscarriage and is going through some sort of psychosis due to it. She needs psychiatric help.", "NTA,\n\nMy brain hurts. Your friend is just seeking attention. If it bothers you enough and you\u2019re ok with not being friends with her. Go for it. And yes you prbly won\u2019t be friends with her. Knowing people like that, they\u2019re petty as can be", "NTA. You should definitely\u00a0call out a \"Friend\" who is lying directly to your face. That would be the fastest pregnancy ever and it was dumb of her to not know about google reverse search", "NTA, i hope anyone with a brain would know she\u2019s lying", "You're NTA, but calling her out in a RUDE way would be frowned upon. Maybe suggest other resources to help her out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Just ignore her.\n\nEdit to add: a few people are suggesting she needs psychiatric help. If you feel that\u2019s the case, tell your/her parents, or a teacher or counselor at your school. Either way, just having an argument about it probably won\u2019t do anything except annoy all your other friends.", "INFO:  how old are the 2 of you?", "This comment is exactly right.\n\nOP, your friend\u2019s lies are not normal behavior and sound like a massive cry for help. Of course she knows she\u2019ll be caught. The lies are ridiculously stupid and unbelievable. The fact that they are so unbelievable leads me to think there may be something very serious happening and she needs trusted adult help NOW.", "wish i had something other than an upvote to give you. very empathetic and very helpful, i hope op listens to your advice!", "Claiming to be pregnant, having a miscarriage, or having a disease, and being dishonest about them...that can be just ridiculous attention/pity seeking. \n\n\nClaiming to have just given birth to twins? Our of the blue? Honestly, that seems more bordering on mental illness or a difficulty with understanding reality. Rather than call her out on it, I'd reach out to your guidance counselor at school.", "Definitely NTA, but I'd recommend doing it gently by suggesting help from a teacher who's close to her or a counselor.", "This person needs help. I knew a girl that started making lies like this when we were around the age it sounds like you are. Turns out she was being sexually assulted by a family member.", "Your friend should rationally know that no one would believe she's given birth at four weeks. For whatever reason, she doesn't. That means she needs help. \n\nIt's really hard to know what the best kind of help to give her is without knowing her and more about what's going on. You should talk to a trusted adult about her behavior and your concerns that something bad might be going on in her life. An adult might have more context about what could be causing her to act this way and would have more power and resources to help her.\n\nNTA for wanting to address what's going on, but confronting her about how delusional she's being probably isn't the best way to do that.", "Don\u2019t call her out like a child, if she\u2019s really ur friend and you\u2019re really concerned about her you\u2019d sit down and talk to her as a friend. Yes you would be an AH for \u201ccalling her out\u201d. If would also make you a petty mean-girl and shitty friend.", "NTA\n\nBut you do need to pull in adults. She needs to be screened for a whole host of mental issues. There's no shame in getting help. But if there are medications that can help her (and it will take awhile to find the right combination) better she starts sooner rather than later, when she's possibly out herself into bad situations from not being \"in reality.\"", "There is no other correct answer than this one OP", "I wouldnt publically call her out because I'm thinking mental illness.\n\nMaybe more along the lines of please seek medical attention.
