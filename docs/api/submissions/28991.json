They\u2019re selfish for making you feel bad about wanting to live where you are comfortable. Why deal with sharing a room with someone you don\u2019t get along with when you have a perfectly good room at your dad\u2019s house?", "NTA it would make much more sense for your older step sister to share with you as presumably she is going to be at the house a lot less in a year or so once she either is working or going to college, so the two of you sharing would seem the better option, since neither of you are expected to be in the house as much as the 13 year old is.", "NTA, it would be easier on the parents to put you in with the older sister anyways as they\u2019d have less fighting to deal with, or they could just put the stepsisters together as well.", "NTA\n\nAt your age you need some privacy.\n\nAt 16 you can choose which parent you live with. If you have a single room at your Dad;'s, go live there.\n\nYour Mum and Stepdad need to re consider how big the house they need is. because 4 bed rooms with 6 occupants is not big enough.", "NTA. You are not acting spoiled : it's totaly normal at your age to want to have some privacy, and to consider living at a place where you can get some.", "NTA. If anything, they should make your stepsisters share a room and you should get your own room. Otherwise they should look for a bigger house that would properly fit the blended household in it.\n\nYou can always let them know that since the older stepsister will probably only be there for about a year before college, she doesn't need her own room since that means a room shuffle between the rest of the family in a year.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re old enough to choose where to live. And your mom is capable of dealing with that.\n\nSo as long as das is an acceptable adult guardian, NTA.", "NTA for being honest with your feelings about the situation. It seems like typically in these situations though the arrangement they set up would be the norm. Oldest gets their own room til they leave for college. Not saying that's right or  wrong just that it seems fairly common. If you would be more comfortable with your dad then I would consider the move.", "NTA. It's better to speak up now than let things get bad later on. If you don't get on with younger SS then it's not a good idea to share a room with her. Maybe you will be better off at your dads. That way all of you can have some privacy.", "NTA\n\nDo try to be clear, however, that this isn't you choosing between her and your father, or rejecting her.\n\nAfter a divorce, parents tend to see every choice a child makes as a competition as to which parent the child prefers, and who wins and loses. \n\nBut there are a lot of factors that go into a child making decisions about their living arrangements, especially as they get older.  Which parent lives by a better school?  Which parent lives in an area where there are activities that the child enjoys?  If you love ice skating, and one parent lives a 10 minute walk from an indoor year-round ice rink, while the other is in a town where you have to drive an hour to get someplace to practice skating, that's a consideration.  Which home offers more privacy?  Which house has a more comfortable situation with step-relatives?  Which parent has a house that is more convenient for getting to school, or for finding a part-time job as an older teenager in school?  \n\nThen there is the timing of moving between houses. Parents might be happy swapping half a week with one parent, half with the other, and that's something a three year old won't object to.  But once you're in school, you want to be more settled, to be close to school, able to visit school friends and go to school activities on the weekend, etc.\n\nA child can't be in both places at the same time.  And the choice often isn't about picking a parent, it's about a holistic look at what life is like in each place, and finding a practical and comfortable living situation.\n\nParents often ask children to put up with inconveniences in the name of sharing custody that the parents would never consider living with themselves.  Constantly moving between houses, ignoring commute times to school/work, sharing space with people not of their choosing, being expected to form a family bond with people whom you weren't born related to and didn't choose as a relative and may not have anything in common with beyond the fact that your parent chose to marry a particular adult who brings along their families.  \n\nYou're allowed to make decisions based on all the circumstances of your life, not just a matter of being \"fair\" cutting yourself in two pieces so each parent gets a section. \n\nAnd in this case, it's a matter of choosing privacy and, if you have to share a room, having a compatible roommate.", "NTA. There's no reason to live like that if you have a decent alternative. Living with your dad seems the better choice.", "nta put the sisters together and you get your own room. easy.", "I grew up in a neighborhood with a family with three girls. They solved the problem by switching it up every six months. Each girl had a room to herself for six months. Twelve months sharing, then six of her own private room. They did this for years! Rotating also helped them sort and thin out their clothing and possessions too. Moving day was a big event!", "Your mom is stalling and is not rethinking anything.", "NTA. Do u live full time at mom's? Do live partime at dad's?", "I really wonder what all these NTAs would say if the stepsister writes she has to share the room because her stepsister...", "Nta Of course your step siblings get along better more, they\u2019ve know each other longer.  You feel on the outside because the siblings close ranks on you, thus the feelings of being out numbered come into it.  Your mother and step dad obviously came to that decision because in a regular household, siblings of a different gender get their own room.\n\nThen the next determination usually comes down to the oldest sibling of the same gender, then gets a room to themselves, with the remaining two sharing.\n\nExcept your a nuclear household and in the beginning you were all shoved into the one room for obvious reasons.  But now in a new house there\u2019s going to be an extra room it\u2019s causing headaches for everyone.\n\nInstead of announcing your future intentions to the family at large, you would have been best to just talk to your mother and tell her your issues are so extreme, you believe living with your dad the better option.", "NTA I hope they reconsider. I understand why you and your older stepsister would want your own rooms. I hope everything works in your favor.", "Clearly, a 16 and 17 year old sharing is far more developmentally appropriated and better than a 16 year old and a 13 year old -- whose maturity levels and interests are entirely different -- sharing.  The parents have made a poor decision and it smacks of favoritism.  I don't blame you for saying what you said, and I wouldn't blame you for following through.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mother is really not considering your feelings on this.   \n\n\nYes, it would be nice for your 17 year old sister to have a single room, but your parents are trying to deal with how to fit 6 people into 4 rooms, and I can see their logic at first making sense, but it DOESN'T make sense if you're already speaking out about trying to share a room with someone in such a different place in life.   \n\n\nGood luck dealing with the situation.", "YTA- For putting you're mom in that situation over having to share a room.", "So\u2026i\u2019ll say it: 2 of HIS children get THEIR own rooms\u2026but YOU need to share with the youngest\u2026?\nNo NTA, have the other step sister share a room with her.", "NTA, they\u2019re both your parents and you\u2019re not a little kid. You\u2019re mum is a dick if she tries to guilt you about this, what\u2019s so special about her that you should live in poorer accommodation when you have another loving parent that can provide your own room.

It\u2019s one thing if there\u2019s no other option - but you do have an option.  You can go live at your dad\u2019s.\n\nI would caution against using it as some sort of \u201cthreat\u201d to get your own room at your mom\u2019s, though.  Because if she does back down and give you your own room, that means the older stepsister now has to share.  And she might take her frustration out on you.

That's a lot extra on mortgage and bills just to accommodate for 2 years. They should look for 4 beds with bonus rooms (formal dining room, basement conversions, 2nd living room etc). \n\nAnd as much as its not ideal their reasonable options in a 4 bedroom are 17 and 13 (coz related) or 17 and 16 because of age, related 11b and 13g could share but that is less ideal for the entering puberty aspect. Unrelated 16 and 13 doesn't make sense. I'm assuming they are telling 17 she gets her own room for the last year and then it becomes 16s.\n\nThey are not being fair!", "That\u2019s usually how it works in non-blended families. In blended families it\u2019s usually that blood siblings share unless the kids want otherwise. I don\u2019t think kids all need their own rooms, but I do think you shouldn\u2019t have step kids share a room unless they are both okay with it. 13 and 16 are old enough ages and far enough apart for it to be weird. I would have found it very strange to share a bedroom with my step sister who was four years younger than me, and we were close. It just would have felt different than sharing a room with my older sister, because we had been sharing a room off and on since I was born.", "I think this should be upvoted!", "Fulltime at my mom's and every 3 day weekend along with holidays at my dad's", "If conditions are better at OP's Dad's house she isn't the asshole for deciding to live with him.

All three girls want their own room!  \n\nBut there aren't enough rooms.  There are a few ways to work out the logic.  Your mother and stepfather have opted for \"the oldest kid gets a private room.\"\n\nBut \"full-siblings share a room, step-siblings don't\" is another way to look at it.  Or \"the two who are closer in age share a room, the one with a big age gap sleeps separately\" is another option.   \n\nAlso \"oldest only has to share for one year, and shares with one sister, then oldest is away at college and each remaining sister has a private room for the school year.\"\n\nWhere is the mother for your stepsiblings, and do they spend time with her?  That also makes a difference.  Perhaps visitation days can be adjusted, so that you're in that house while the others are with their mother, and then you're with your father while they are in your mom/stepdad's home.  That would allow privacy, even if use of the space is shared.\n\nA 13 year old also needs more supervision than a 16 or 17 year old, and perhaps an earlier bedtime.  If she's at a different school, she may be getting up at a different time, as well.  \n\nThere may be other options, depending on the circumstances.  Do some brainstorming, and talk to others about options.", "She wants her own room ( most people do so I get that) but you're the one who's selfish for not wanting to share with a 13 yr?!? Why do her feelings for wanting her own room trump your's for not wanting to share with the 13yr? Your offering a compromise . You're willing to share with her or move out.
