You are not acting spoiled : it's totaly normal at your age to want to have some privacy, and to consider living at a place where you can get some.", "NTA. If anything, they should make your stepsisters share a room and you should get your own room. Otherwise they should look for a bigger house that would properly fit the blended household in it.\n\nYou can always let them know that since the older stepsister will probably only be there for about a year before college, she doesn't need her own room since that means a room shuffle between the rest of the family in a year.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re old enough to choose where to live. And your mom is capable of dealing with that.\n\nSo as long as das is an acceptable adult guardian, NTA.", "NTA for being honest with your feelings about the situation. It seems like typically in these situations though the arrangement they set up would be the norm. Oldest gets their own room til they leave for college. Not saying that's right or  wrong just that it seems fairly common. If you would be more comfortable with your dad then I would consider the move.", "NTA. It's better to speak up now than let things get bad later on. If you don't get on with younger SS then it's not a good idea to share a room with her. Maybe you will be better off at your dads. That way all of you can have some privacy.", "NTA\n\nDo try to be clear, however, that this isn't you choosing between her and your father, or rejecting her.\n\nAfter a divorce, parents tend to see every choice a child makes as a competition as to which parent the child prefers, and who wins and loses. \n\nBut there are a lot of factors that go into a child making decisions about their living arrangements, especially as they get older.  Which parent lives by a better school?  Which parent lives in an area where there are activities that the child enjoys?  If you love ice skating, and one parent lives a 10 minute walk from an indoor year-round ice rink, while the other is in a town where you have to drive an hour to get someplace to practice skating, that's a consideration.  Which home offers more privacy?  Which house has a more comfortable situation with step-relatives?  Which parent has a house that is more convenient for getting to school, or for finding a part-time job as an older teenager in school?  \n\nThen there is the timing of moving between houses. Parents might be happy swapping half a week with one parent, half with the other, and that's something a three year old won't object to.  But once you're in school, you want to be more settled, to be close to school, able to visit school friends and go to school activities on the weekend, etc.\n\nA child can't be in both places at the same time.  And the choice often isn't about picking a parent, it's about a holistic look at what life is like in each place, and finding a practical and comfortable living situation.\n\nParents often ask children to put up with inconveniences in the name of sharing custody that the parents would never consider living with themselves.  Constantly moving between houses, ignoring commute times to school/work, sharing space with people not of their choosing, being expected to form a family bond with people whom you weren't born related to and didn't choose as a relative and may not have anything in common with beyond the fact that your parent chose to marry a particular adult who brings along their families.  \n\nYou're allowed to make decisions based on all the circumstances of your life, not just a matter of being \"fair\" cutting yourself in two pieces so each parent gets a section. \n\nAnd in this case, it's a matter of choosing privacy and, if you have to share a room, having a compatible roommate.", "NTA.

They solved the problem by switching it up every six months. Each girl had a room to herself for six months. Twelve months sharing, then six of her own private room. They did this for years! Rotating also helped them sort and thin out their clothing and possessions too. Moving day was a big event!", "Your mom is stalling and is not rethinking anything.", "NTA. Do u live full time at mom's? Do live partime at dad's?", "I really wonder what all these NTAs would say if the stepsister writes she has to share the room because her stepsister...", "Nta Of course your step siblings get along better more, they\u2019ve know each other longer.  You feel on the outside because the siblings close ranks on you, thus the feelings of being out numbered come into it.  Your mother and step dad obviously came to that decision because in a regular household, siblings of a different gender get their own room.\n\nThen the next determination usually comes down to the oldest sibling of the same gender, then gets a room to themselves, with the remaining two sharing.\n\nExcept your a nuclear household and in the beginning you were all shoved into the one room for obvious reasons.  But now in a new house there\u2019s going to be an extra room it\u2019s causing headaches for everyone.\n\nInstead of announcing your future intentions to the family at large, you would have been best to just talk to your mother and tell her your issues are so extreme, you believe living with your dad the better option.", "NTA I hope they reconsider. I understand why you and your older stepsister would want your own rooms. I hope everything works in your favor.", "Clearly, a 16 and 17 year old sharing is far more developmentally appropriated and better than a 16 year old and a 13 year old -- whose maturity levels and interests are entirely different -- sharing.

Not close or anything but I wouldn't say I hate them.  \n\nAnd IDK about the housing stuff, but the neighborhood where moving to only made 4 bedroom houses and where I live basements really aren't a thing", "Where I live I dont think ive ever seen a basement, they aren't common around here", "Lol this is gonna sound kinda bratty but thats part of the reason why I like it at my dad's I have a stepbrother there too but hes like 21 and rarely home so im just the youngest", "Since the 2 are blood siblings they should share a room. You should get your own room. The oldest should be going to college next year. You should be comfortable where you live. So I would tell Mom either you get your own room and the 2 siblings share a room (it'll only be for a year after all and they get along better anyway) or you will live with your dad. And you wouldn't be TA for doing so.", "So everyone is allowed to be selfish but not you? It's not good to be too selfish, but if you don't keep your own interests in mind, then who will?\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to want to move in with your dad if you're more comfortable there, just ask him first if it would be possible.\n\nNTA.", "Let us know how it turns out! As it does sound like a frustrating situation.  Depending upon how big the second largest bedroom ends up being, it might be possible to partition the room (try googling bunk bed dividers), to provide more privacy and space to whoever ends up sharing, which hopefully won\u2019t be you and your youngest step sister\u2026", "That's assuming it is only two years.\n\nIf the kids all attend college out of town and live elsewhere during the school year, they still are likely to return to the parents' home for summer and holidays.  \n\nIf the parents intend to make this their long-term home, then farther in the future you might have, say, all four kids, with their spouses and children, coming to celebrate Thanksgiving, and the space will be useful for them to stay with the parents. \n\n\"Eighteen and you're out\" is not a good thing for parents to plan on for their kids - the kids will do better with a secure home-base as they transition to independent adulthood.", "It varies by state as to whether a kid can \"choose\".  The uniform act, which is adopted in most states, just has the child's wishes (if they are mature enough to express a reasoned opinion) as one of 11 or so factors to consider.  \n\nAnd yes, a parent would have to move to modify parenting time and it would be a fight.", "I agree but the youngest is an 11 year old boy. His younger sister is 13 years old. Neither of them are going to want to share a room together at that age. The father could make them since they are full siblings but I don't they would.", "Will your dad let you move in full-time if you get a judge to agree?", "Can you day trip your mom's only and stay with your dad? You are old enough to state your preference, correct?", "That's fine.  As long as you're happy with the role you're being given.", "Do you guys have attics? Those are also a good choice", "It may sound bratty and selfish but if you have your own room at dad's then everyone else just needs to learn how to deal without you there.", "I see your logic, but also look at it from the whole family\u2019s point of view. OP having her own room would mean that one room constantly had two occupants, while OP\u2019s room was simply empty during the times she was with her father. I can see any one thinking that is not the best use of the space. \n\nOP sharing with the older sister would still mean that the older sister had the room to herself a lot of the time.\n\nOP is entitled to say \u201cI get my own room or I stay with my dad\u201d, but having her own room isn\u2019t the most rational use of the space.", "Under the circumstances no one wants to share a room. Someone has to and it's not fair that the youngest has always been given his own room.", "Maybe im talking a big game but I really dont think so, not cause he wouldn't want to see me but cause he knows im doing it for how he'd put it \"petty reasons\"", "OP being gone so often might actually be a good reason for her not to have to share a room.\n\nDuring the time when she's gone, the stepsister whom she is sharing with is going to feel that it is her room, alone.  OP will have no way to keep an eye on her possessions and make sure that the 13 year old isn't using them.  OP will not be able to enforce boundaries about what parts of the room are hers, vs. the stepsister's.  The parents are not going to be in the room constantly to ensure that the stepsister isn't misusing OP's things or encroaching on OP's space.\n\nHaving to come back, every week, not knowing if her things were used or misused, and having to make the effort to reclaim her space (younger stepsister: \"Oh, I was just using your bed as a place to sort and stack my laundry as I folded it, and I forgot to clear off your bed before you got home...\" or stepsister: \"Why do I have to share the closet space when OP isn't even here half the time?\") is going to lead to a lot of resentment.\n\nResentment from OP that she constantly has to worry about her things and her space, resentment from the stepsister she's sharing with that they have to leave half their room unused so that OP can stay there.  \n\nBeing able to lock the door behind her when she leaves to be with dad, and knowing her things and her space will be safe until she returns, is a big deal.  Having to bounce between houses for the sake of shared custody or visitation time is already an inconvenience for OP, without having to wonder what's happening in her space while she's away.\n\nIt's not going to be OP and a stepsister sharing the room equally.  It's going to be each stepsister has a room, and which stepsister's room does OP get stuck in when she's at that house. \n\nOP doesn't deserve to have to have a lower priority in her own home because she's stuck bouncing between houses.", "> having her own room would mean that one room constantly had two occupants, while OP\u2019s room was simply empty during the times she was with her father. \n\nThat's only assuming that steps don't spend time with their mother too. Plus it sounds like OPs dad is a weekend/holiday dad only.", "This is not a petty reason. You don\u2019t have privacy at your other home which is a normal thing to want. That sounds more like he\u2019s being selfish and lazy. Especially when you\u2019re old enough to drive so he\u2019s not dealing with the burden of getting you to school.", "she spent almost the entire summer with her dad, not seemingly a weekend/holiday dad, there's no other real mention of the visitation agreement. We're kinda missing some info here, like how the exes are with each other, are they combative, co-parenting well, not a lot of info in the post.", "\u201cThat's only assuming that steps don't spend time with their mother too\u201d\n\nYes, good point. No mention about that one way or the other, so we don\u2019t know.", "No he'd mean petty as im not seeing my mom or siblings over something I could stay and try to work out", "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/itMDnmyRG3\n\nThis was OPs comment I was referencing. Also, \"spending the summer\" would equal \"summer *holidays*\"", "Yes but they don't want to work with you. \n\nWho pays who child support? I'm guessing if you were to stay with your dad full time mom would be paying him..... (Also he probably wants you to figure it out so he doesn't have to go back to court, that costs time and money too."]}
