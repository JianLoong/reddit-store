If only I would share the cooking (a thing no would had meaningfully volunteered for) it would be a lovely holiday. It\u2019s just so easy for people to criticize work they\u2019re not doing. And it\u2019s really easy for people who just don\u2019t value you to not feel the work you do is valuable. Stop doing this work no one appreciates you for. More importantly, if this is the work that fulfills, go find the people who will love your socks off for doing it.", "16 years old and you're being treated like the head of the HH. That's just sad. And the lack of appreciation? Sorry your family sucks. NTA", "NTA you are a gem for cooking and they should be grateful!!", "NTA this scenario sometimes happens to parents (usually mothers) who do most of the cooking. But in that case they\u2019re a parent and have more authority to tell everyone to eat what they\u2019re served. I\u2019ve been that as a parent. And it really sucks to not be appreciated and thanked for that effort and work everyday. It\u2019s worse that you're in this position as a kid/teenager. Your siblings are AHs for treating you like crap. And your parents even more so for not supporting you and piling on the complaints. Stick to your guns. I hope someday you find a partner who appreciates you and what an amazing cook I\u2019m sure you are.", "Nta they are adults they need to start acting like it. Either stop cooking for them all together or tell them that they need to appreciate that you are cooking for them when it should be the other way. They should be cooking for you. Do I like doing the laundry or the dishes? No. Do I do it anyway? Yes. They need to grow up and stop teaching your siblings how to be ungrateful brats.", "Stop cooking dinner. This is a form of parentification, making meals is NOT your responsibility, especially when it coupled with abuse\n\n\n\nCook for yourself and tell the others to do the same", "NTA.   You are taking the time and effort to plan and make meals (I find the planning the worst part).    Don\u2019t let them ruin your enjoyment of cooking!   You may as well experiment a bit and/or just cook what you like since they\u2019ve made it appear by they are going to whine anyway", "NTA,  \n\n\nYou're not their chef slave.  \n\n\nThey can learn to take up cooking if they don't like what you made, or go back to eating takeout. It really isn't that difficult unless they're like destruction incarnate/death served on a plate when it comes to cooking...", "NTA. Your parents made you take on what should be their responsibility and they complain about how you do it??  Just say nothing, cook what you want, and then leave when you're of age and let them fend for themselves.", "nta. Tell them they are being demanding unappreciative brats. You tried to accommodate them,nothing was good enough. If they want something different they can go back to ordering take out", "NTA.  I am one of five.  We ate whatever our mom cooked for dinner b/c there was not enough time in the day for my mom to cater to everyone's tastes.  Your parents should be ashamed for the way they and their other children treat you.", "No appreciation for someone else cooking, can\u2019t please everyone.", "You're not a fucking short order cook. If they prefer something different, they can do like nearly every family out there. Suck it up & eat what you cooked or make something for themselves.\n\nNTA, but until you can get out of there, I don't see much changing. They're acting like a bunch of spoiled assholes, your parents included.", "I think I started cooking around 13. I'm an only child and a latch key kid. But my parents were supportive and appreciative. OP'S family are a bunch of ingrates.", "The attitude OP has to deal with is off the charts. I would be beaten within an inch of my life and sent to my room hungry if I or my brothers complained like that.\n\nNot to mention, OP has low-functioning adults who can't even manage to open a few cans and put dinner on the table. Fast food? Really? Not only very expensive but very unhealthy as a steady diet.\n\nNTA. OP needs either to stop cooking all together or give them something to really complain about so they don't want him to cook anymore.", "\u201cmy parents would\u2019ve physically abused me if i complained\u201d isn\u2019t the flex you think it is, dude. i agree with you on everything else though, these parents are pathetic", "Yeah, it's super unreasonable that your siblings apparently expect you to make something different for each of them.  That's not how family dinners work!\n\nAlso unreasonable that your dad expects you to read his mind about when he's going to be home (or perhaps just cater to him *every* day, on the off-chance he'll be there to eat it?), and that your mom expects you to magically know which ingredients are off-limits.", "they didn't say it as a flex but im glad you made yourself feel better", "I get that your family sucks to cook for, but I wanted to push back on the idea that it's to be expected.", "You are not the asshole. They don\u2019t appreciate you and don\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA Your parents should be ashamed of themselves!  Here is their 16 year old voluntarily cooking, busting their butt in the kitchen and all they can do is whine about it?  I say stop cooking for everyone, it is not appreciated at all.  \n\nMy mom always told me I had 2 choices for dinner, take it or leave it.  You can always have a family meeting and tell them to help you with a set menu for the week and that is what you will cook.  If they don't like that, they can get their own food.  As for your siblings, please see what my mom said.", "You are a good person dealing with very selfish people .Cook for your self and think of their complaints  as water .While they talk just stare at their throat  and imagine s beautiful waterfall with  water cascading over the rocks .Just keep saying \u201c hmmmm\u201d.", "My siblings are 12, 10 and 9. None of them ever learned how to cook. They take after my parents with a pretty strong hate for cooking.", "Even if someone has no real interest in learning to cook, and wants to be as low effort as possible, all they have to do is get a slow cooker. They don't even have to make up their own sauces, there's plenty of packet mixes out there. Chuck in your meat and/or veg, put in the sauce mix and any water or stock that may be needed, turn it on low and ignore it for 8 hours, have a delicious meal. \n\nIt doesn't have to be an expensive slow cooker. Mine cost $25 at KMart.", "They are!", "It's not hate for cooking, it's laziness.\n\nWhat will they you when you leave for college.\n\nYou approach is the right one.   \n\nI'm sure they can make simple things like grilled cheese, soup, baked potato. \n\nThe variety is huge for simple easy cooking.", "OP, you can say this to your parents....\n\n>Never complain about the food someone else cooks for you. You can eat it and appreciate the effort or cook for yourself.\n\nAlso, you can even invite your grandparents over to eat your cooking and see what happens.", "They will go back to ordering takeout all the time. Both my parents lived off takeout their entire adult lives.", "My dad does expect me to have food ready for him every day just in case. He also expects me to know what he's eating in a week. As for mom... she even has labels she could use to help me out. It's not like I get to ask for certain things to cook with. I make do with whatever they choose to buy."]}
