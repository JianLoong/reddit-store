That's truly annoying.", "Nope. You\u2019re an adult and the things that bothered you as a kid can be stopped more easily now you are an adult. Plus leaving the room is better/ more peaceful than arguing over saying your thoughts out loud and having nothing change.", "NTA! Next time say \u201cWhy on earth are you asking?\u201d and see what she says", "Nope NTA. You\u2019ve asked her repeatedly not to talk to you in that manner and she continues to do it so you are well within your rights to leave the room or just straight up ignore her until she can speak to you in a more congenial fashion.", "NTA. However, I wouldn\u2019t let her run you out of your own living room or kitchen. Maybe formulate some fun responses like, \u201cwhat on earth am I watching?

Lots and lots of baby heads. Want some?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s your house.

If it modifies her behavior/breaks that annoying habit, keep doing it! Or, ask her what on earth makes her think it's her business? Why on earth would she speak to you like you're 5?", "Nta I would just reply, what does it look like I\u2019m doing? Or the wise ass route of, \u201cTV, food\u201d\nor even repeating, \u201cWhat on Earth are You doing?\u201d Back at her.", "NTA", "NTA. You've asked for a long time.

I had a roommate that did this.  I could be sitting reading a book and she\u2019d ask me what I was doing.   I\u2019d say the first thing that came to mind. - playing tennis, I\u2019m at the mall, washing the dog, swimming- just anything other than what I was obviously doing.", "What on earth did I just read?

I have a coworker who always asks me, \"What on Earth are you listening to?\" I just started responding that I'm listening to zombies eating slow running folks who didn't prepare for the apocalypse. Took her twice to stop asking. (Yes, she now thinks I'm crazy as a loon.)", "In psychological terms what you are doing is absolutely correct.  Ignoring the behavior has been proven many times to stop or 'extinguish' it. \n\nAny kind of attention acts as a reward. When she gets no attention she gets no reward.  So she stops doing it. It's very effective. \n\nAnother thing you can do is pick something  she does  or says that you like and respond positively to it. Sm8le, look at her,  move closer,  compliment  her etc.\n\nThat  means that overall she's not getting any less attention from you.", "YTA. If small things like this bother you this much, that makes me think there's underlying resentment. Its better to address the root rather than passively skirmishing over catch phrases. If your relationship was healthy, it seems like you wouldn't care. Ofc if you have like ocd or sometbing maybe its a different story, hard go tell", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
