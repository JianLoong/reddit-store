{"id": 5231, "submission_id": "zqyr2j", "title": "WIBTA if I asked my neighbors to not let their dogs out from 12-2pm?", "selftext": "I'm a 28F with a 16m old daughter. For those who understand how baby naps work, she's been on a one nap schedule from 12-2pm since she was about 13.5-14m old. For context, my neighbors have 2 adult German Shepard dogs who everytime they are let outside bark and bark and, you guessed it, bark. \n\nThe issue lies in when they let their dogs out. Now I understand fully that they need to be let out to use the bathroom or to run around and burn some energy. The problem is, they tend to let their dogs out right in the middle of my daughter's nap, right when she's transitioning sleep cycles. As such, the barking always wakes her cutting her nap short. This causes her to get overtired and be unruly at night, especially before bed. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (her father) and I have tried a handful of times putting her to bed earlier but it never works. She's used to her bedtime being when it is and if we try to get her down even 15 minutes earlier she fights going to sleep. It's even worse when she's getting overtired. \n\nI feel like IWBTA because they can't control when their dogs need to be let out. But at the same time we've had issues before with the barking and while they did some training they didn't stick with it, to my knowledge. Also they rarely walk the dogs. \n\nI really don't want to come across as an insensitive jerk to their animals but it would help so much if they just didn't let them outside between those two hours. \n\nAlso to add: my fianc\u00e9 puts her to bed 5 nights a week and its just in his personality that he doesn't have my saintly patience so when she gets unruly it causes him tremendous stress. \n\nSo WIBTA if I talked with them and asked them to not let their dogs out between 12-2?\n\nETA: I know its early and I've read all the comments so far. Basically its confirming my thoughts but I wanted to seek outside opinions. \n\nJust to clarify: this isn't a daily occurrence, it happens maybe once every two weeks. I didn't want to exceed the character limit so didn't think to add that in. But I do understand where everyone is coming from so far and humbly acknowledge that I'd be in the wrong to bring it up and expect something to change. We've been working on her sleep in general to help with transitioning sleep cycles and some days are great while others are not. I personally am not comfortable asking my neighbors this, but my fianc\u00e9 is the one saying I should at least talk with them.\n\nEdit 2: I absolutely want to avoid bringing this up. I know its not a fight worth fighting. And if I were to ask on behalf of my fianc\u00e9 and they said no, I wouldn't judge them at all for that answer. They have their schedules and routines like we have ours. I do not expect them to change their lives to make ours easier. I know this is something we have to deal with. This post was more to reaffirm my own feelings on the issue.\n\nFinal edit as I have to go to work: THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SAID IWBTA. YOU REAFFIRMED MY GUT FEELING ON THIS. I have no intention of making this an issue but I wanted to see what outside opinions would be because I knew deep down this would be a ridiculous thing to do. We'll find ways to make my daughter's sleep better in time. And for those saying I shouldnt expect to have others accommodate my life: I absolutely do not expect anyone to. Thats ridiculous and stupid and if I had a dog who did this and someone asked me to fix my schedule to accommodate their child I would say thats not my problem to solve. So again, THANK YOU FOR REAFFIEMING THIS FOR ME.", "created_utc": 1671568154, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqyr2j/wibta_if_i_asked_my_neighbors_to_not_let_their/", "score": 1106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't make other people's lives revolve around your schedule.", "Ywbta that\u2019s a two hour block and that may be the best time for their schedules.  Get a white noise machine or something.  This isn\u2019t middle of the night. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to work on his issues.  Maybe he can talk to someone about how to handle stress better. It\u2019s not your neighbors problem.", "YTA.  You don't get to control ambient noise in your neighborhood during the day merely because you have a baby.\n\nTry sound-proofing her room, using a white noise machine, or sleep training instead.", "YWBTA, gently. I completely understand your frustration at exterior noises but that's just it... you can't control exterior noises. If another neighbor got a dog, would you have to go ask them the same? What if some construction was happening for a few weeks?\n\nJust as an aside: someone who lets their dogs stay outside for hours and bark likely won't be sympathetic to your issue either, but that's just my own personal opinion since I used to live next to an inconsiderate person like this.", "Yta. Have babies and toddlers. I also have dogs. Get her more ambient noise or in a different area of the house.", "sorry YTA  \nyour baby has been on this sleep schedule for maybe 3 months and im assuming your neighbors have had their dogs longer than that. they should not have to change their schedule around your babys nap time. Adapt and adjust to the situation.", "YTA. That's not a reasonable request and it's a long time block. Your daughter also should learn to nap with some ambient noise.", "So lets get this straight, your nearly 1 1/2 year old daughter has transitioned to a two hour nap per day in the past 2 months that coincides with your neighbors regular time to let their dogs out of the house.  Dogs bark, wake baby, you can't catch a break.  You can ask, they can say no.  YWBTA if you push it any further.\n\nEventually, for your own sanity and those around you, your daughter needs to learn how to sleep with noise.  Try a white noise machine in the room to drown out other noises from outside.  As soon as she learns to sleep through this, you will have more freedom around your house.", "You can ask, but you WBTAH if you expect them to comply. I feel for your situation, but their world does not revolve around your baby.", "You are correct. YWBTA if you asked them to keep their dogs inside from 12-2pm. Potentially your child crying at night carries over to their house too. \n\nI get you\u2019re having issues, but that\u2019s parenthood. You and your husband will get over it. Good luck.\n\n*edit for the comment below. \n\nYWBTA cos it\u2019s during the day, it\u2019s their backyard. Asking them to accommodate her and her baby instead of her and her husband adapting to parenthood in an AH move when the neighbours aren\u2019t doing anything wrong on their property.", "YWBTA. As a parent, you are going to have to work extremely hard to examine your entitlement. \n\nThis sort of thing happens with some parents. You know, the kind of parents that get mad at airplane passengers that won't give up their seats for them. The kind of parents that get mad that someone in front of them won't let them cut in line at amusement parks. The kind of parents that get mad when movie theater staff kick them out when their baby cries. The kind of people that get mad when people have childfree weddings. \n\nIt sounds like this is your first slip into this mindset. So let me make it very clear: no one cares about your baby except you and your family. Literally no one. So when your neighbour lets their dogs out, you have to be okay with the fact that the world doesn't exist to accommodate you and your baby. Because no one cares.", "Yes, YWBTA.\n\nIt's their dogs and schedule. You'll just open a can of drama worms with your neighbors.", "YWBTA, the world doesn't stop because you had a kid. Your neighbors have every right to let their dogs out whenever they want during the day.", "YTA.\n\nYou want them to not let their dogs out to use the bathroom, for a two hour window in the middle of the day, everyday?  How does that seem like an even remotely reasonable thing to ask?", "Mild YWBTA, because it's not their kid, and it's not fair to expect them to re-arrange THEIR routine to make yours easier. \n\nYou can certainly ask, but I'd go in with homemade cookies and the verbalized understanding that it's absolutely not their responsibility, but you'd be ever so grateful if this was possible. \n\nPersonally,  I'd buy a sound machine and put it in your daughter's room at nap/bed time. The waves or brown noise settings should diffuse the barking. If you have an Alexa, put that in the room and ask for brown noise. It has the deepest resonant tones, so it can cover more outside barking than white noise.", "YWBTA. You can only control yourself. \n\nLet\u2019s flip the scenario: What if you lived in an apartment and your neighbors came over and told you to stop \u2018letting\u2019 your baby cry because it\u2019s affecting their sleep schedule. \n\nDo you see how ridiculous of a question that is now?", "Add a sound machine to her naps. I\u2019m light sleeper. I got one years ago and it\u2019s amazing. I can give you the brand name of it if you are interested. I\u2019ve tried others and apps. The one I use is just fantastic. It\u2019s adjustable and it would do a great job drowning out the doggos next door", "You can't stop people from living their lives. They are not doing anything wrong here. \n\nSure you can ask and explain why.  But if they say no. Or just don't do it. You have to just live with it. \n\nYou choose to live next to people. Then you get life's noises.", "Soft yta. How long has your neighbor had these dogs? And all of a sudden you want their schedule to change to accommodate you? You knew when they were let out yet you chose to have your daughter nap during this time when you could've easily picked an earlier or later time.", "Yes, YWBTA.  \n\nYour world revolves around your daughter's sleep schedule, but no one else's does.  You will need to find a way to address your daughter's sleep issues without requiring other people to modify their schedules.  Largely, they will not feel the need to do so.  In addition, your fiance's issues with stress/patience at bedtime are his own to resolve.  He needs to learn how to cope with unruly behavior from your daughter in a healthy manner, because that is what parenting is and will be for the next 18+ years.  Rather than address this indirectly through your neighbor's dogs, it would be more productive for you to look into professionals and tools that can help him learn to manage bedtime with an uncooperative child as smoothly as possible.   \n\nBesides, if someone is inconsiderate enough to allow their dogs to bark for hours, they're almost certainly not considerate enough to feel the need to acquiesce to your request.  Their response is more likely to be negative than anything else.", "Didn\u2019t even need to read the whole post to know you were going be the asshole here", "Question: Where do you purchase that much audacity? \n\nHere's the deal - YOU chose to have kids. You and your husband did that all on your own without anyone else's input. Therefore, your child is you and your husband's responsibility. Nobody else's.  \n\nYWBTA. Your neighbors likely have their animals on a schedule, too. Mine always knew - when I got home, it was potty time and there was NOTHING that could change that. If I was half an hour late, I probably had a mess because they had been waiting for me ALL DAY to come home and take care of them. 9 long hours because that's how long I was gone every day. Even on weekends when I was home, their schedule stayed the same. Almost like they were TRAINED for those times. \n\nThe biggest factor in my vote is the TIMING. You stated your child is 16 months and has been on this schedule since she was 13.5-14 months, so this is a SUPER new issue AND they do this in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY. Do you intend to demand they change their lives again when she changes her nap schedule? Because no, absolutely not. I hope your neighbors aren't as petty as I would be because I'd start making my standard grass mowing time during her naps just to remind you that I purchased my home and property the same as you and do NOT have to allow someone else to dictate what I do and when on it. \n\nThis reeks of so much entitlement. It would have been very different if they were having raging parties all night long or were training a Bassett Hounds and Huskies Choir, but they're not. They're letting their dogs out. \n\nPlease understand that raising a child will only get more difficult as she grows and develops her own thoughts and ideas. Not one single other person is going to give a flying fuck about her needs over their own because she's not their kid. \n\nYou should get used to the idea that your child is not a factor in ANYONE else's decisions, actions, or routines. \n\nAnd leave the damn neighbors alone. They didn't create a child who apparently needs dead silence all the time. Get your baby a white noise machine and work on her going back to sleep when she wakes up too soon. Her sleeping habits are YOUR problem, not your neighbors' or their dogs'.", "YWBTA - entitled much?\n\nMy parents used to bring me everywhere, they would go to parties and we would be in the other room sleepin gon the bed. At some point your daughter needs to accept outside noises and that life still continues even though she takes a nap.\n\nYou can't control what happens outside and you can't expect other people to cater to you when they are not even in your home. FInd a solution for your daughter, but it's your own problem, no one else's.", "Yes YWBTA.   \nThis isn't happening daily, or even weekly.   \nStart getting your daughter on a different sleep schedule and get a white noise machine.", "The fact that it only happens Twice a month is absolutely pertinent information. You could\u2019ve left a of the other stuff out.  Changes my judgment. Now it\u2019s YTA. \n\nActually, he might be ESH. Dogs should not be barking unless there is a reason.", "YTA. You cannot expect other people to rearrange their lives around your baby, especially people like your neighbors who you aren't close to.", "YTA how self centered and entitled do  you have to be to ask something like this lol? As one mom to another, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you because you popped out a kid.", "YWBTA. Their dogs are on their property and while it sucks, they have the right to let them out at times that are convenient to them. \n\nIf your fiance can't handle putting his own daughter to sleep, that's your biggest problem.

They could say no. You can make your daughter's room more insulated against sound though if that helps. Routine is a good thing.", "NAH if you ask.\n\nIt depends on what neighborhood you\u2019re in whether they can be considered a sound nuisance for letting the dogs bark and bark like that. That\u2019s not purely dogs being dogs. And maybe they should be walking them more and just letting them into the yard less. German shepherds are smart, friendly dogs! They like waking their humans around!\n\nSo, asking, NAH. If they say no, oh well. \n\nEDIT in response to OPs edit and the early comments: But it might be *fine* for them to shift schedules! You don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know that it makes a difference to anyone. If it were me, I\u2019d want to know.\n\nBut then, I\u2019m neighborly with our neighbors. We do things like ask if workmen can use each other\u2019s driveways on a particular day when then need to get on roofs. Nobody\u2019s obligated to say yes. It\u2019s just an ask, a thing that would be helpful if it doesn\u2019t disrupt you too much. Just like keeping the dogs in for those two hours might be. (Especially given that it\u2019s not a thing that happens frequently.)\n\nAgain, NAH!\n\n2nd edit: I\u2019m a bit concerned that your fianc\u00e9 wants *you* to do the asking instead of doing it himself. This would make sense if maybe you\u2019re the one with an existing relationship with the neighbors. But if you had that you probably wouldn\u2019t be asking Reddit!", "This thread really shows who has dealt with kids and who hasn't. Routine is really important with kids and there are a lot of factors that go into routines - such as, Maybe the daughter isn't tired until noon and that's why she won't sleep earlier. \n\nI said in a different comment - be prepared to hear no from your neighbor and if that's the case- you might have to shift your entire day by an hour one way or the other. Figure out which way is easier for you. Then choose between transitioning your routine 5 minutes at a time or All at Once. All at once is going to suck but- it works. Wake up earlier and just go for it. \n\nOr- Take Control! \nGet black out curtains!! Make a sound proofing area for baby to sleep in using insulation board from Home Depot or Lowe's.

I can keep mine inside for two hours no problem. They can manage without a potty break. I'd simply say okay, let them out a bit before noon, and keep them inside while your baby naps. Dogs can be left alone inside a home for hours while the owners work, and it's not a huge handicap to just...not let them out during those two hours. Now, if they are only home at lunch and that's when they let the dogs out, problem. But generally?

For those who understand how baby naps work, she's been on a one nap schedule from 12-2pm since she was about 13.5-14m old. For context, my neighbors have 2 adult German Shepard dogs who everytime they are let outside bark and bark and, you guessed it, bark. \n\nThe issue lies in when they let their dogs out. Now I understand fully that they need to be let out to use the bathroom or to run around and burn some energy. The problem is, they tend to let their dogs out right in the middle of my daughter's nap, right when she's transitioning sleep cycles. As such, the barking always wakes her cutting her nap short. This causes her to get overtired and be unruly at night, especially before bed. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (her father) and I have tried a handful of times putting her to bed earlier but it never works. She's used to her bedtime being when it is and if we try to get her down even 15 minutes earlier she fights going to sleep. It's even worse when she's getting overtired. \n\nI feel like IWBTA because they can't control when their dogs need to be let out. But at the same time we've had issues before with the barking and while they did some training they didn't stick with it, to my knowledge. Also they rarely walk the dogs. \n\nI really don't want to come across as an insensitive jerk to their animals but it would help so much if they just didn't let them outside between those two hours. \n\nAlso to add: my fianc\u00e9 puts her to bed 5 nights a week and its just in his personality that he doesn't have my saintly patience so when she gets unruly it causes him tremendous stress. \n\nSo WIBTA if I talked with them and asked them to not let their dogs out between 12-2?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
