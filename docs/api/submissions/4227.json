I have never said anything because she was in PT school so I knew her schedule was difficult. She has since graduated, and this year, his sister spent Thanksgiving with her boyfriends family and we spent Thanksgiving with my family, so it was assumed we would spend Christmas with my husbands family in Santa Barbara. However his sister decided they ALSO wanted to spend Christmas with her boyfriends family again because the boyfriends brother was sick and couldn\u2019t come to Thanksgiving. They made this decision and informed us of it, with no discussion at all about what works for us. \n\nThey proposed we all spend New Years weekend together instead as a belated Christmas. We decided on this, but then his sister and her boyfriend decided that they would \"compromise\" and invite all of us up to her boyfriends house for Christmas (us and my in-laws). This really frustrated me because I feel like they really just got the best of both worlds.\n\nWe told them it would be difficult for us to spend Christmas at the boyfriends house and also see my family (BFs family lives in Nor Cal, my family in LA). His sister then calls him (my husband) and is all upset, and says it\u2019s super important to her that we come and meet her boyfriends family and that this is them compromising. I told my husband that I really don\u2019t want to spend Christmas Day with a bunch of people I don\u2019t know ( I have never met his sisters boyfriends family), and that I would much rather spend x-mas Day in an intimate setting in his childhood home or at my own home in LA. As my family and I are fairly religious, x-mas Is a really important holiday, and has always been a really big deal in my family. \n\nWe are moving to Europe next year, so this is likely the last Christmas I will get to spend with my family for a couple of years. I told my husband it was more important for me to spend time with my own family vs building relationships with new people and that we should spend Christmas separately because he really wants to appease his sister and spend Christmas with her boyfriends family.

She\u2019s just as entitled to change her plans as the sister, particularly if sister\u2019s new plans means OP would spend Christmas with strangers, which is awkward.", "Because they are strangers, its her boyfriend not fianc\u00e9 and she wants to spend it with her family. Not everyone is interested in meeting new people at what is normally a private family event. I would never spend Christmas with Strangers. Maybe if one stranger was invited that would be ok but this is a couple( couple means 2, few means 3-4 and more is just too much). My guess is he wants to propose in front of everyone and they want them there for that. Either way, she should do what she wants and in the end, its just a boyfriend. I have never heard of a family going to a members boyfriends house for Christmas. Its ridiculous.", "Do you like being in an unfamiliar place on what is a big religious holiday? Especially having never met the people whose house you are at? I know I wouldn't.", "NTA. This is a tricky situation, but you leaving for Europe for a few years completely validates your want to spend time with your own family, and everyone should understand that. Unless your SIL and her bf have been together for 10+ years.. he\u2019s not your family and as such doesn\u2019t deserve to be prioritized. \n\nThat being said, spending Christmas together as a married couple is the default, and spending it separately should be a mutual decision. Hope you both can reach an amicable conclusion.", "NTA. Moving to Europe next year? You better be spending this Chrismas with your own family. Let them meet their in laws and do their things. If your husband don't agree, then he's an idiot that's risking harmony in his own home for people that he'll never be around much.", "NTA", "NTA. How can they not see the justification in you wanting to spend time with your family, as opposed to a bunch of random people? SiL sounds like a bit of a princess. It's not all about her.", "Op, I see where you are coming from, but is it a NAH here? It\u2019s a NAH for me. \n\n1. Your husband wants to spend time with his family during Christmas as per your agreement seeing as it is his last holiday and you did Thanksgiving with your family. \n\n2. Your SIL\u2019s partner has a sick brother. It sounds like SIL is serious with her partner and thinks of this relationship as a long term commitment, yes? So her potential in-laws are having a tough time for Christmas and she wants to be there for them. \n\nYour husband and his family want to send the message to SIL\u2019s future potential in-laws that they understand and that that family sticks together so they are willing to compromise. Your husband also wants to support his potential BIL. \n\n3. I also totally get your scenario. They are not your future in-laws and it\u2019s the last time you will potentially see your family during a major holiday for a while. You want to spend time with your family and are trying to put them first. \n\nI believe a sit down with your partner is in order and a better compromise. \n\nAre there more days available so you can both see your families and spend equal amounts of time with them? Can you go for Christmas and support your SIL and potential future BIL and his family as an act of charity? And then do New Year\u2019s with your family instead of with SIL again? \n\nI hope for the best for both you and your husband as you move countries and that you can both find time to spend with your families during the upcoming season.", "My bad!  I mis read and thought she was referring to North Carolina\ud83d\ude0f. Reading comprehension on the fritz again.", "Love it!", "That was a funny post. But I've had to do the same thing for a European friend. I was telling him how I flew from New York to Colorado for my uncle's wedding and he scoffed about how wasteful it was for the environment to fly when we could have just driven and that we were boujie for flying. I was like, no.....no you have to fly, it would take DAYS of driving to get there. He didn't believe me so I had to bust out a paper map (pre smartphone days) to prove it. He was shocked, had no idea it was that big. Pretty funny.", "I don\u2019t understand why this is a big deal. It\u2019s both OP and her husbands last Xmas here before they move. So she spends this year with her family and he spends it with his at his sisters boyfriends house. \n\nWhich, quite frankly if I were OP\u2019s husband, would piss me off if my parents knew this might be the last holiday I could be at their house and they let my sister get away with this fuckery.", "It\u2019s reasonable to expect that a person who wants others to pass judgement on a situation would give the whole situation. \n\nSo, back to my original point of ESH. \n\nOP didn\u2019t express her plans to see her family until SIL\u2019s crappy version of a compromise\u2014in fact OP stated outright that they and husband would be visiting *his* family for Christmas because they spent Thanksgiving with her family (no mention of popping in to see husband\u2019s family 2.5 hours away also). Sounds like a double standard brought on by OP\u2019s displeasure with SIL\u2019s selfishness and SIL\u2019s relatives constantly catering to her entitlement. \n\nEveryone sucks here because none of them are handling the situation like healthy adults. It\u2019s not a difficult concept to say what you mean the first time."]}
