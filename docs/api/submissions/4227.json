I have never said anything because she was in PT school so I knew her schedule was difficult. She has since graduated, and this year, his sister spent Thanksgiving with her boyfriends family and we spent Thanksgiving with my family, so it was assumed we would spend Christmas with my husbands family in Santa Barbara. However his sister decided they ALSO wanted to spend Christmas with her boyfriends family again because the boyfriends brother was sick and couldn\u2019t come to Thanksgiving. They made this decision and informed us of it, with no discussion at all about what works for us. \n\nThey proposed we all spend New Years weekend together instead as a belated Christmas. We decided on this, but then his sister and her boyfriend decided that they would \"compromise\" and invite all of us up to her boyfriends house for Christmas (us and my in-laws). This really frustrated me because I feel like they really just got the best of both worlds.\n\nWe told them it would be difficult for us to spend Christmas at the boyfriends house and also see my family (BFs family lives in Nor Cal, my family in LA). His sister then calls him (my husband) and is all upset, and says it\u2019s super important to her that we come and meet her boyfriends family and that this is them compromising. I told my husband that I really don\u2019t want to spend Christmas Day with a bunch of people I don\u2019t know ( I have never met his sisters boyfriends family), and that I would much rather spend x-mas Day in an intimate setting in his childhood home or at my own home in LA. As my family and I are fairly religious, x-mas Is a really important holiday, and has always been a really big deal in my family. \n\nWe are moving to Europe next year, so this is likely the last Christmas I will get to spend with my family for a couple of years. I told my husband it was more important for me to spend time with my own family vs building relationships with new people and that we should spend Christmas separately because he really wants to appease his sister and spend Christmas with her boyfriends family. Every time I try to explain my side I look like the bad guy, and no one in his family can see where I am coming from for not wanting to spend X-mas there.
