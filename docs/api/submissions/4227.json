I have never said anything because she was in PT school so I knew her schedule was difficult. She has since graduated, and this year, his sister spent Thanksgiving with her boyfriends family and we spent Thanksgiving with my family, so it was assumed we would spend Christmas with my husbands family in Santa Barbara. However his sister decided they ALSO wanted to spend Christmas with her boyfriends family again because the boyfriends brother was sick and couldn\u2019t come to Thanksgiving. They made this decision and informed us of it, with no discussion at all about what works for us. \n\nThey proposed we all spend New Years weekend together instead as a belated Christmas. We decided on this, but then his sister and her boyfriend decided that they would \"compromise\" and invite all of us up to her boyfriends house for Christmas (us and my in-laws). This really frustrated me because I feel like they really just got the best of both worlds.\n\nWe told them it would be difficult for us to spend Christmas at the boyfriends house and also see my family (BFs family lives in Nor Cal, my family in LA). His sister then calls him (my husband) and is all upset, and says it\u2019s super important to her that we come and meet her boyfriends family and that this is them compromising. I told my husband that I really don\u2019t want to spend Christmas Day with a bunch of people I don\u2019t know ( I have never met his sisters boyfriends family), and that I would much rather spend x-mas Day in an intimate setting in his childhood home or at my own home in LA. As my family and I are fairly religious, x-mas Is a really important holiday, and has always been a really big deal in my family. \n\nWe are moving to Europe next year, so this is likely the last Christmas I will get to spend with my family for a couple of years. I told my husband it was more important for me to spend time with my own family vs building relationships with new people and that we should spend Christmas separately because he really wants to appease his sister and spend Christmas with her boyfriends family. Every time I try to explain my side I look like the bad guy, and no one in his family can see where I am coming from for not wanting to spend X-mas there.

You are leaving the country and likely won't be home for Christmas next year. The boyfriend family stuff is ancillary. Be with your family this year even if it is separate. NTA.", "NTA. You already set your plans, and it is important to you to spend time with your family at Christmas since you are moving next year. You can see in-laws at another time. Your husband should understand this and be on your side. The rest of the extended in-law family has no vote.", "NTA.  Tell hubby it's your holiday too and you're not spending it with strangers. Just because he's willing to kiss his sister ass doesn't mean you need to be there.", "NTA.  Your SIL can\u2019t dictate what you or your husband do, even less what your extended family does.  A simple, \u201cno, thanks\u201d is all SIL should get", "hell no NTA.  i don\u2019t know why the sister gets to make plans for everybody but everything you said makes perfect sense\n\nyou didn\u2019t say how your husband feels about your idea - just that his family doesn\u2019t like it.  i don\u2019t even know why they get a say in the matter\n\neven if your husband is less than thrilled, stick to your plan.  with you moving to Europe, it\u2019s just logical for you both to be with your own families this year", "NTA! Spend the holidays how you please", "NTA- I feel like this is so odd. I honestly wouldn\u2019t want my my sons, girlfriends, family, at my house for Christmas.

The distance between OP\u2018s home in LA and sister-in-law\u2018s boyfriend\u2018s family in Norcal is probably a six or seven-hour drive. \n\nOP:  next time, you can just put the distance for people.  Lots of Americans unfamiliar with California and even more overseas viewers as well.\n\nNTA. \n\nYour husband\u2018s constant appeasement of his sister is to the detriment of you and your own family.", "NTA.", "NTA.  We did that one year.  My sister in law hosted her family (my husband\u2019s) and her husband\u2019s side of the family at the same time.  It was very awkward.  Her husband\u2019s kids (her step kids) only got a handful of gifts from our side of the family and threw them off the side because their dads mom went crazy with loads expensive gifts.  That the only year we did that.  No surprise here they marriage ended about 4 years later.", "NTA. Your SIL needs to stop assuming she gets to call the shots for the whole family. It's far more important to spend time with your family while you can. \n\nYour husband needs to grow a pair and stop going along with his bossy sister instead of actually seeing to the needs of his WIFE.", "Your SIL is being incredibly ridiculous. She and her boyfriend decided on a \u201ccompromise\u201d- one they decided on with nobody else, which doesn\u2019t even make it a compromise. It\u2019s more like SIL and her boyfriend just decided they get to dictate how you spend your holidays. They think they run the show, but that\u2019s not actually how this works.\n\nYour husband giving into this shitshow is probably exactly why you\u2019re in it. He\u2019s enabling her behavior by giving her full control. Instead of listening to his wife\u2019s concerns and coming to a legitimate *compromise* as a couple, he\u2019s decided it\u2019s best just to walk on eggshells than to actually grow a backbone.\n\nThis man has probably spent his entire life letting his sister tell him what to do and ultimately allowing her to make all of his decisions for him. \n\nGo spend quality time with your family for Christmas and enjoy it while your husband spends his entire holiday kissing his sister\u2019s feet and worshipping her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Spend Xmas with your family.  Your husband needs to come to the understanding that he is married to you, not his sister, he should be telling her that you will be sticking with your initial arrangement.  She is interfering in your marriage, I'm guessing it happens for other events too. Why should you be made to miss out on seeing your parents at Xmas before you move to Europe to spend it at someone's place who is nothing to you.  \n\nI'd be having serious discussions with your husband about where his priorities lay, is this kind of favouristism, special treatment also going to continue if you have children?  Will they come second after his sister?", "Def N T A.", "Nta. How much would it suck to spend Xmas with sil's bf family and they break up? You'd be wasting a holiday on people you don't know that really aren't a permanent fixture in your life at all. I'd be PO'd if I got stuck at my SILs bfs families house and they didn't stay together. What a waste when you could be with YOUR family.", "Yeah, NTA.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s your Christmas too, and you\u2019ve been going along with SIL\u2019s plans for years.

Either way, it would\u2019ve been better to come out and just say you need the time with your family if that\u2019s how you really feel. \n\nYes, your husband and his family *and you* enabling your SIL\u2019s selfishness for this long sucks.
