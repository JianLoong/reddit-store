I told him I understood and asked if I could order room service and I\u2019ll pay for it.\n\nAt first he said ok, but then he wanted to me to order it and not eat in the room. The hotel policy is to only serve room service in the room, and not in the other restaurant areas. His reasoning is the room will smell but I planned to order a sandwich or soup.\n\nHe then said we can go for a walk and I can eat outside. So we went for a 45 minute walk trying to find a non fast food place that he would like. Sadly this wasn\u2019t a success so we came back to the hotel. \n\nBy now it\u2019s 10.30pm and I asked if I could order my soup as it\u2019s cold and I really wanted something warm. He said it would take too long, that he wanted to sleep and not hear my clanking the spoon while I\u2019m eating. \n\nSince the other restaurant areas are closed, room service was my last option. \nI didn\u2019t want to argue with him so I left it. I\u2019m also on my cycle so I really feel tired and needed the soup. \n\nI need to know AITA for this request because he called me a fat one (I\u2019m 165 and 47kg).", "created_utc": 1685996676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141qmjv/aita_for_wanting_to_order_room_service/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why the fuck did you need to specify that you would be paying like that would have any impact on your need to eat food??? Your husband sounds controlling if not abusive.", "Tell your husband *he* can go for a walk. Or hide in the bathroom.

When you are hungry, you need to eat.\n\nHis eating schedule should not dictate yours.  Also, he needs to be able to handle that others are eating when he isn't.  The world does not revolve around him.\n\nHis behavior is controlling and abusive.  He should not be denying you the right to have a meal, and OP, don't let him do this again.  Eat when you need to.

He's got a strange diet so he has to inconvenience you?  What kind of crap is that??  Why do you need his permission to get dinner for yourself?

Beyond that he should not be calling you fat.", "NTA If your husband was so concerned about the smell he could have gone for a walk by himself and purchased air freshener. What an ass he is.

You can eat. Order the damn food and eat the food and if he can't handle it, he can go sit in the lobby for 20 minutes while you have some soup.", "NTA. But, you need to be a shepherd and get the flock out of dodge sooner rather than later. Your husband has zero respect for you and that isn't going to improve with age, it's going to get worse.
