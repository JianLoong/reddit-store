I told him I understood and asked if I could order room service and I\u2019ll pay for it.\n\nAt first he said ok, but then he wanted to me to order it and not eat in the room. The hotel policy is to only serve room service in the room, and not in the other restaurant areas. His reasoning is the room will smell but I planned to order a sandwich or soup.\n\nHe then said we can go for a walk and I can eat outside. So we went for a 45 minute walk trying to find a non fast food place that he would like. Sadly this wasn\u2019t a success so we came back to the hotel. \n\nBy now it\u2019s 10.30pm and I asked if I could order my soup as it\u2019s cold and I really wanted something warm. He said it would take too long, that he wanted to sleep and not hear my clanking the spoon while I\u2019m eating. \n\nSince the other restaurant areas are closed, room service was my last option. \nI didn\u2019t want to argue with him so I left it. I\u2019m also on my cycle so I really feel tired and needed the soup. \n\nI need to know AITA for this request because he called me a fat one (I\u2019m 165 and 47kg).", "created_utc": 1685996676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141qmjv/aita_for_wanting_to_order_room_service/", "score": 659, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've said he's on a restrictive diet, that you can't eat freely around him, and that he called you fat when you're medically underweight - I'm about your height and the last time I weighed 47kg was when I was thirteen. \n\nIt sounds very much like he is controlling his weight and food intake, and by extension, yours.  From your previous post it sounds like he is very image-focused, and that that also extends to you. Maybe he's insecure about his appearance compared to his much younger hotter wife, or maybe he's a controlling asshole, or maybe both? only you will know. \n\nI'm assuming this guy must have some redeeming features, or you wouldn't still be there, but he's clearly not okay, and his not-okay is spilling out onto you. You should be able to eat what you want, when you want. You should be able to age naturally and look however you want without worrying that the man who promised to love you until you both turn into wrinkled prunes won't kick you to the kerb. You should be able to (gasp) gain a few kilos without it being a big deal - and it sounds like you could probably gain a fistful without even hitting the middle of the healthy weight range, let alone the kind of inevitable plumpening that most people should really expect to happen when they're planning to spend the rest of their life with someone. \n\nEither way, if he wants to choose to live a restricted life with restricted eating habits, that's on him, not on you. Sure, there's always compromise in a relationship, but it should be equivalent compromise - your basic human needs don't have to have to be compromised for his convenience or preference. \n\nIf he doesn't want to compromise his own convenience so you can eat a fricking meal, even when he's confronted with the assholishness of his behaviour, then you'll know exactly how much he cares about your basic human needs.
