I told him I understood and asked if I could order room service and I\u2019ll pay for it.\n\nAt first he said ok, but then he wanted to me to order it and not eat in the room. The hotel policy is to only serve room service in the room, and not in the other restaurant areas. His reasoning is the room will smell but I planned to order a sandwich or soup.\n\nHe then said we can go for a walk and I can eat outside. So we went for a 45 minute walk trying to find a non fast food place that he would like. Sadly this wasn\u2019t a success so we came back to the hotel. \n\nBy now it\u2019s 10.30pm and I asked if I could order my soup as it\u2019s cold and I really wanted something warm. He said it would take too long, that he wanted to sleep and not hear my clanking the spoon while I\u2019m eating. \n\nSince the other restaurant areas are closed, room service was my last option. \nI didn\u2019t want to argue with him so I left it. I\u2019m also on my cycle so I really feel tired and needed the soup. \n\nI need to know AITA for this request because he called me a fat one (I\u2019m 165 and 47kg).", "created_utc": 1685996676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141qmjv/aita_for_wanting_to_order_room_service/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
