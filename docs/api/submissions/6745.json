However, yesterday, we went out to a bar to get some drinks, and we were having a nice chat and all. That's when Mark saw a woman with a group of friends who seemed to be tearing up a little. I don't know the situation, but it's not unusual for people to cry in bars when they get drunk.\n\nMark got up from our table like a damned tiger stalking a prey and zeroed out on the group. Quickly enough, he was seated beside the crying woman, talking to her.  Thirty minutes later, he comes to us saying he's gonna bail with her.

Not only that, but I couldn't hold myself and told him flat out, he was the worst person I had ever met in my life. Absolutely a parasite.\n\nAs you can imagine, things escalated and I went home. Both Mark and Dave are angry, calling me names from asshole to worse things. My other friends are divided between supporting me and saying I should have kept my thoughts to myself.\n\nI wouldn't change what I did, however, now I'm considering if I should just have kept my mouth shut like people are saying.

It\u2019s disgusting.\n\nI\u2019m glad you told him. Fuck his friends. This is how we break shitty societal patterns.\n\n\nSocial pressure actually holds a ton of weight.

Friends and relatives can be very quick to tell you to keep quiet, don't rock the boat, sweep it under the rug etc. You do not need to keep your thoughts to yourself. You are right, he is a parasite and it is sick. By not speaking out that is how society goes down hill fast.", "I think it is important that they know.
