Quickly enough, he was seated beside the crying woman, talking to her.  Thirty minutes later, he comes to us saying he's gonna bail with her.

Both Mark and Dave are angry, calling me names from asshole to worse things. My other friends are divided between supporting me and saying I should have kept my thoughts to myself.\n\nI wouldn't change what I did, however, now I'm considering if I should just have kept my mouth shut like people are saying.
