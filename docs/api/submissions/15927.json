At first I thought it might be one of the workout machines making a high pitched squeaking, but when I went up to the workout room I noticed that there was a little toddler playing by the weights and screaming its head off. The screaming was so loud that I heard it in the locker room, through my headphones, and even when I went to the other workout room on the floor below to get away from the sound. There was a woman working out who was clearly the mom, and a guy who was working out with her that I thought might have been her trainer. At one point the woman even set up a little play pen for the kid and blocked off two other machines. This kid screamed for over an hour, and I watched two people walk into the gym, notice the kid screaming and just leave. The screaming was so loud that I wasn\u2019t able to finish my workout and had to leave early. At no point did any employees tell this woman and her kid to leave, even thought the gym rules (which are posted on the wall for everyone to read) clearly state that no one under 13 is allowed in the gym. \n\nThe reason that I didn\u2019t complain yesterday was because I assumed that the lady working out was a single mom, and the guy was a trainer and I tried to be compassionate in case maybe her babysitter canceled and this was a one time thing. But as I was leaving early from the workout, I saw that guy that I assumed was the trainer bouncing the kid up and down and kissing it so it was clearly the dad. So I don\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t have left the kid at home then and not ruined other peoples workouts. Would I be the asshole if I complained to the staff about the incident today?

It is so dangerous for a toddler to be at the gym. They could get seriously injured or killed. Equipment has warnings on it for a reason. Nothing in a gym is a toy.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, that seems kinda dangerous for the kid (which is probably why the gym doesn't allow people under 13)... lots of heavy stuff and machines that could cause injuries to a toddler.\n\nI would almost guarantee that if the gym manager was aware of this he would not allow it.  Probably they weren't there and the employees weren't paying attention but this would be a huge liability for the gym... its a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "NTA \n\nIt's incredibly dangerous to have a toddler in the gym, and I guarantee you that their management would not be okay with them being unattended while Mom worked out. Not only could the baby get hurt, but they could cause injury to someone else in so many different ways. You should complain, though they won't be able to do anything unless you let them know when this is occurring.", "NTA. kids are not meant to be in the gym, it's dangerous af. you have the right to complain, especially as they are technically breaking the rules.", "NTA - I would definitely complain to the gym. Just for safety alone I\u2019d alert the staff because a kid is not safe in that environment, especially with the parents working out and not able to give all of their attention to watching their child around heavy equipment and adults using heavy equipment.", "NTA. They should have left with the child as soon as it started screaming. If the child was well-behaved, I would say leave it, but it was not. It was incredibly rude of the parents to force the entire gym to endure their child's tantrum. \n\nI am amazed the gym staff did nothing. I would definitely talk to someone.", "NTA children that young do not belong in the gym especially not in the weight room. Not everywhere is meant for children.", "YWNBTA. This goes beyond annoyance; it's a safety issue for everyone involved. That little one was standing by the weights? What would have happened if one had fallen or slipped? If that child had gotten hurt,  you better believe the parents would have sued the gym owners for everything they had and then some. You'd be doing them and other members a favor.", "OP - NTA.  Rules state \"under the age of 13 are not allowed in the gym\".  2) That couple inhibited the use of gym equipment that you paid to use as well. 3) That couple had an overall disregard for other patrons who wish to use their workout to decompress, or raise endorphins, without major interruption.  \n\nThat couple was in the wrong - there are plenty of ways to exercise without towing a very young child to a gym, or joining a gym that has a \"child zone.\"\n\nGo ahead and state your irritation and concerns to the staff, but request a follow up from a manager/owner to ensure you are properly heard.", "NTA. A gym is not a place for a child it\u2019s unsafe, and if the gym has a policy in place regarding children then staff need to enforce that.", "NTA\n\nNot only is that incredibly rude, it\u2019s also not safe. The gym is for slamming heavy blocks of metal around. The baby is literally on the ground and could get hurt.\n\nThere is a woman with a service dog at my gym. I\u2019ve never complained about it because it doesn\u2019t bother me and she needs him for medical reasons, but I am always so scared I\u2019m going to turn around with a weight in my hand and hit him in the face.", "NTA - the staff should have noticed and taken care of this on their own.  It's against the rules, and a huge safety liability for the gym to have a toddler playing on/around the equipment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
