At first I thought it might be one of the workout machines making a high pitched squeaking, but when I went up to the workout room I noticed that there was a little toddler playing by the weights and screaming its head off. The screaming was so loud that I heard it in the locker room, through my headphones, and even when I went to the other workout room on the floor below to get away from the sound. There was a woman working out who was clearly the mom, and a guy who was working out with her that I thought might have been her trainer. At one point the woman even set up a little play pen for the kid and blocked off two other machines. This kid screamed for over an hour, and I watched two people walk into the gym, notice the kid screaming and just leave. The screaming was so loud that I wasn\u2019t able to finish my workout and had to leave early. At no point did any employees tell this woman and her kid to leave, even thought the gym rules (which are posted on the wall for everyone to read) clearly state that no one under 13 is allowed in the gym. \n\nThe reason that I didn\u2019t complain yesterday was because I assumed that the lady working out was a single mom, and the guy was a trainer and I tried to be compassionate in case maybe her babysitter canceled and this was a one time thing. But as I was leaving early from the workout, I saw that guy that I assumed was the trainer bouncing the kid up and down and kissing it so it was clearly the dad. So I don\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t have left the kid at home then and not ruined other peoples workouts. Would I be the asshole if I complained to the staff about the incident today?

It is so dangerous for a toddler to be at the gym. They could get seriously injured or killed. Equipment has warnings on it for a reason. Nothing in a gym is a toy.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, that seems kinda dangerous for the kid (which is probably why the gym doesn't allow people under 13)... lots of heavy stuff and machines that could cause injuries to a toddler.\n\nI would almost guarantee that if the gym manager was aware of this he would not allow it.  Probably they weren't there and the employees weren't paying attention but this would be a huge liability for the gym... its a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "NTA \n\nIt's incredibly dangerous to have a toddler in the gym, and I guarantee you that their management would not be okay with them being unattended while Mom worked out. Not only could the baby get hurt, but they could cause injury to someone else in so many different ways. You should complain, though they won't be able to do anything unless you let them know when this is occurring.", "NTA. kids are not meant to be in the gym, it's dangerous af. you have the right to complain, especially as they are technically breaking the rules.", "NTA - I would definitely complain to the gym. Just for safety alone I\u2019d alert the staff because a kid is not safe in that environment, especially with the parents working out and not able to give all of their attention to watching their child around heavy equipment and adults using heavy equipment.", "NTA. They should have left with the child as soon as it started screaming. If the child was well-behaved, I would say leave it, but it was not. It was incredibly rude of the parents to force the entire gym to endure their child's tantrum. \n\nI am amazed the gym staff did nothing. I would definitely talk to someone.", "NTA children that young do not belong in the gym especially not in the weight room. Not everywhere is meant for children.", "YWNBTA. This goes beyond annoyance; it's a safety issue for everyone involved. That little one was standing by the weights? What would have happened if one had fallen or slipped? If that child had gotten hurt,  you better believe the parents would have sued the gym owners for everything they had and then some. You'd be doing them and other members a favor.", "OP - NTA.  Rules state \"under the age of 13 are not allowed in the gym\".  2) That couple inhibited the use of gym equipment that you paid to use as well. 3) That couple had an overall disregard for other patrons who wish to use their workout to decompress, or raise endorphins, without major interruption.  \n\nThat couple was in the wrong - there are plenty of ways to exercise without towing a very young child to a gym, or joining a gym that has a \"child zone.\"\n\nGo ahead and state your irritation and concerns to the staff, but request a follow up from a manager/owner to ensure you are properly heard.", "NTA. A gym is not a place for a child it\u2019s unsafe, and if the gym has a policy in place regarding children then staff need to enforce that.", "NTA\n\nNot only is that incredibly rude, it\u2019s also not safe. The gym is for slamming heavy blocks of metal around. The baby is literally on the ground and could get hurt.\n\nThere is a woman with a service dog at my gym. I\u2019ve never complained about it because it doesn\u2019t bother me and she needs him for medical reasons, but I am always so scared I\u2019m going to turn around with a weight in my hand and hit him in the face.", "NTA - the staff should have noticed and taken care of this on their own.

Can\u2019t just have toddlers running around ppl lifting weights", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBetter for the gym to have complants than to lose customers. THat mom is an AH, and gym staff are AHs for not reacting.", "NTA. Seems like there is no place safe in the world from children and dogs.", "What the **fuck**? NTA", "NTA, that is SO dangerous. I have a 2.5 year old and I can lose sleep if I imagine all of the nonsense she\u2019d get into at a gym. It\u2019s also written on the wall", "NTA. if it happens again report it immediately. It is a big liability for the gym itself, and I\u2019ve never been to a gym that allowed kids under 13 outside of niche situations, and often kids under 16 still need parental supervision.", "I would also let the gym know you witnessed multiple patrons leave due to the child. Money talks", "This right here.  \nComplain to the gym about it and if it happens again write scathing reviews about them.", "I would totally complain! NTA", "NTA\n\nCertainly the gym has a \"no kids\" rule.  It's crazy this was allowed at all... kids are a huge liability for a gym.", "NTA, it is not the screaming it is the danger of the workout equipment.  If this is a chain style gym contact the corporate office.  If it is a privately owned make sure you contact the owner or general manager, not the night manager.", "NTA that is incredibly dangerous. Does no one work there? I can\u2019t believe no one came out and made them take the child out of that dangerous environment.", "NTA, and I would ask why the staff wasn\u2019t enforcing the rules and why you had to complain.", "No, NTAH, I would never ever take my 3 or 5 year old to the gym and ruin other peoples workouts.", "NTA. They have rules prohibiting children for a reason.", "Yep.  Complain. Its a public gym, not a private gym, they can't just do what they want and it's so dangerous! I almost take myself out all the time in the gym. Heck the kid could just stick their fingers on a machine... and boom, a very crushed hand. Person on the machine might not even know the kids doing it too if they are on the other side. \n\nNta. Complain and escalate it, because obviously they were aware before but nothing was done.", "NTA, ignoring the obvious safety issues of having a toddler in the gym, the gym states no one under 13 allowed in, they very likely knowingly broke the rules, you should report them", "NTA\u2026.I\u2019m not sure if I would just up and complain though\u2026idk..maybe im passive. Id ask staff \u201cdid you hear the screaming baby yesterday? What was that about?\u201d \u201cAre kids allowed in the gym? What should I do if I see toddlers running around?\u201d \n\nThat way it kinda builds the story about what you can tell them what you witnessed yesterday and know what to do moving forward\u2026and they can tell you their protocols if a child is in the gym as they shouldn\u2019t be.", "YWNBTA. In fact, you'd be the asshole if you **didn't** report it, because toddlers sincerely have no business at all, full stop, being in a gym due to the very high risk of injury.", "NTA. The kid doesn't belong there. Period. When it's parents heard it screeching then they immediately should have stopped what they were doing and handled it. No excuses for that. I would 100% say something to prevent it from happening again.", "NTA. It is not safe for a toddler to be there and it is clearly a violation of gym policy. I\u2019m surprised an employee did not say anything since it\u2019s also a huge liability.", "There's a reason the gym forbids children under the age of 13. That toddler could   \n have been injured and the gym would have been held liable. The staff should have been informed about this (with all the screaming this child was doing, it's a wonder they didn't hear it.). The gym's management definitely should be made aware of this matter.

Do you have any idea how much staph, ringworm, hpv, athletes foot etc added on public gyms? Young kids with incomplete immune systems should NOT be anywhere near them. Don't get me started on ball pits. NTA", "I once almost kicked a toddler in the head in the gym, it was terrifying. I had the machine attached to my foot and I was doing an exercise that had me leaning forward almost horizontal, holding on to the machine, and kicking back and up. Someone had a toddler walking around and I saw movement coming behind me on the corner of my eye just in time. It's just irresponsible to bring a toddler to the gym.", "The prospect is horrifying. A weight as light as a 2 lb. weight dropped on a foot can cause injury.

Nor is it fair on other patrons to disrupt their training or block access to machines.\n\nParents need to find a gym with a creche.", "YWNBTA.  Rules are posted for a reason and I'd wager a few other gym patrons will also be saying something.", "Nta. \n\nMany gyms have a daycare on site. \n\nThey should find a new gym.", "I see I'm not the only one who tried to kill themselves on their dad's treadmill as a kid in the name of fun.", "This saying couldn't have been used better", "I would also be worried about injuring myself. You could have easily hurt yourself had you had to stop mid-kick or something like that.", "I've almost hit adults doing that machine. I am shocked how many adults don't watch where they're going.", "NTA.\nIgnoring the general assholiness of bringing a screaming child into an adults space in general (and then keeping them there),  the gym is dangerous for curious toddlers who are blissfully unaware of their surroundings.", "NTA. Always report this kind of thing. It's dangerous and irresponsible. One of the reasons so many people became anti-kid is because people just lost their sense of boundaries and you can't get any kid free spaces. Kids shouldn't be in gyms for adults, they shouldn't be in bars, they shouldn't be in R rated movies. People don't take screaming kids outside anymore. Adults deserve their own spaces and people with kids need to respect that.", "It was take your kid to work day yesterday.", "NTA.   Weren\u2019t there some kids injured or killed by some exercise machines recently?  Peloton something something \u2026", "NTA. I used to go to a crossfit gym that let moms bring their kids into the workout area. 20 adults running around with heavy weights and you have 3 year olds screaming g and swinging from rings.  Nobody would say anything to them. The mothers were entitled twats. The coaches wanted to be friends with everyone. And the owners were idiots.  Now, I go to a YMCA that offers babysitting for all ages.  It's great for the kids, parents, and everyone else."]}
