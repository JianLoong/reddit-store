We're waiting to be seated and he makes a comment about the hostess's body to another guy friend of ours. I find out a bit gross that he's talking about other women *in front of his gf* but hey, not my place.\n\nWe get seated and order drinks and we're talking about movies we like and he mentions he's a fan of Kubrick. Now I love Kubrick's movies and he's dating my best friend so I figure we're probably very alike. So I start talking with him about movies and directors we like and mention that I don't actually own any Kubrick movies in my collection, despite enjoying them. He asks why and I mention I don't really want to give money to him or his family (I'm aware he's since passed).\n\nHe then gets pretty defensive and starts trying to be all \"art requires perfection\" and \"the actors knew what they were signing up for\" and that Duvall was \"emotionally disturbed\" prior to her abuse by Kubrick and that Bernadette Milnes was \"a weak woman who couldn't take the demands of a real job in acting.\" Milnes quit because the demands Kubrick placed on them for that scene made it \"too real\" and she felt unsafe and victimised. She was not the first to quit... for the same reason.\n\nSo at this point I'm kind of not vibing with this man and decide I'll just skip the movie and go home. The rest of my friends however get me to stay (I didn't want to say I was leaving because of my best friend's bf and couldn't come up with a decent excuse). We get to the theatre and movie goes fine, bf is mostly amenable and during the movie little talking occurs anyways so I'm kind of glad I stayed. We start heading home and my best friend and her bf are a little bit tipsy so I decide to take them to my place for the night instead of make them drive back to Brighton.\n\nAt my place they sober up, me and best friend are going through old pictures and there's a photo of me and her kissing at her thirteenth birthday. Bf comes over while we're looking at pictures and when we come to the picture of us kissing he comments \"wish I could get in on that hot action.\" For those wondering, it's a fairly chaste kiss. It's a proper kiss, and also my first kiss, and taken awkwardly using a disposable camera to take a selfie before smart phones were everywhere.\n\nI tell him to leave and that he's a disgusting, misogynist piece of shit.\n\nNext day and my best friend is mad at me for getting upset over \"an innocent comment\" and that her bf is really hurt that I dislike him and so I should apologise for losing my temper.

Not that I blame you for this.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA for the way you feel but you should make an effort to apologize for not being honest about why you wanted to go and letting your emotions get to the point where you blew up at him.

Totally understandable tbh but blowing up at someone is never a good way to handle things (even if it is kinda warranted)", "YTA, this is your best friend's boyfriend. I'm not going to claim I understood a single thing about the movie director part, but the comment about the waitress, well some girls don't mind that (your best friend, not the waitress). Assuming your friend doesn't mind and he's not doing it behind your best friend's back. The comment on the photo could have been a joke or maybe he didn't mean the action of when you were 13/8 but rather today? Call him misogynistic, that's fine, he is, but not everyone cares. With all of that said this is your best friend's boyfriend, and you judged him over one day's interactions. Get to know him better before calling him such names, it certainly isn't going to help your relationship with your best friend.", "Idk it was kinda premature.

How about just accept not everyone has the same moral views and humor as you do? That doesn't make them disgusting, that makes them different.", "I think the comment about the kiss was a joke. I could see myself making a crack like that. You disagreed about a director nbd. Not sure what the comment was about the server but he shouldn't have said something like that where his gf or anyone outside his bros could hear so thats on him. Overall you seem to be overly sensitive and probably being a bit performative with your outrage.

The guy friends have never made sexual comments about me, and my boyfriend never makes sexual comments regarding my female friends. Bc that's weird and makes everyone involved uncomfortable. I won't lie and say he never brought up the idea that he would enjoy seeing me with a girl, but he has never brought any of my friends into that situation and he has never given a person he would specifically want that to be with.

It's the people that don't want to learn that are a problem in my opinion. My mom is a good example. She 62 and I teach her things all the time. She's not homophobic or racist but she can say problematic things without knowing. So I explain to her why they are problematic and she asks me questions and wants to learn and be better. On the other hand, I would never try to engage in any teaching moments with her sister because she is hopeless. And she is the mother of my feminist cousin.
