It's her wedding, her rules. Once she makes one exception, it opens up the door to everyone else demanding to be an exception. Weddings are expensive.  The more guests, the more it costs.

Yes, this is a red flag. \n\nFirst, because at your age, it's weird that the sister wouldn't be invited to bring a +1 anyway. Is she going to be seated at some Children's Table? You're seeing a weird family dynamic here. \n\nAlso, though, it almost seems like the Bridezilla (and the family?) is trying to manipulate you to pop the question to your GF, so you will be her fiance. Which, honestly,  the level of how uncool that is depends on a lot more information than what you provide in your post. But who wants to spend a lifetime with some preening older sister saying to your wife, \"He never would have proposed if I hadn't forced him for my wedding!\"... Just, ew.\n\nI think, away from her parents and sister, you need to have a real, honest, private conversation with your girlfriend. Maybe in a therapists office.

This is a pretty standard rule for weddings, especially if you\u2019re trying to keep the guest list down. Even though you e been dating for 2 years it\u2019s more about your relationship with the bride and groom than you and her sister. If this is anyone\u2019s battle to fight it\u2019s your girlfriends not yours.", "Yta. Stop being entitled. That's not even ur event", "NTA. But would you really break up with her over this. I mean yes she should of stuck up for you then but it\u2019s not her wedding her rules. So are you saying if she goes to her sisters wedding you will end it. No lie, this is a stupid rule.", "NTA for asking but wrong for pushing the issue.\n\nI think you should start planning some sort of weekend getaway with your  buddies.  Somewhere that's known to have a lot of clubs and hot ladies dancing there late at night...maybe Vegas?\n\nAnd just forget for a weekend that you even have a gf and consider whether or not you want to continue your relationship or take it to the next level.  It would be hilarious if you proposed to your gf the weekend after the wedding.\n\nYour response had people laughing so I can't call you an AH for bringing on the laughs.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were right to ask politely ONCE, but not to cause a discussion.

SHE would hav eneeded to discuss it in private with her sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo tere is another test coming long for you if your gf is an AH and if the relationship you have with ehr is worth keeping: If your gf is NOT an AH, she will tell her sister that she will not come if you are not invited. If you are of any importance to her, she will not go without you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: If she goes without you, this is a clear satatment of the value she places on YOUR relationshp.
