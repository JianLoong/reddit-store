Yes because if you order a hot chocolate for the kid with a nut allergy it could kill them. \n\nWhile I hate religion as a whole for my own reasons.

You have known about your sisters boundary and you have known that you agreed to watch her kids.

After the children's sermon, all the littles would go off to Sunday School while the rest of the adults would stay for the rest of service. The church we go to now allows children in the main sanctuary for service but most parents drop them off in the kids corner of the church for age appropriate Sunday school lessons.
