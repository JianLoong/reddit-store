She's just mad she got called out on her terrible behavior. Most people who behave badly get even worse when someone calls them on it. They know they're in the wrong and try to deflect.

Basically she\u2019s moving out and is pretty pissed about the whole situation. Since we live in a staff accommodation on the worksite i had to speak with the HR and they had to transfer her to a different location.
