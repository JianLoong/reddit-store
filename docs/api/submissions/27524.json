It sounds like you understand that, but your communication wasn\u2019t great. Regardless of your intent, to another person it sounded like you were excusing her, so in the future I\u2019d recommend trying to think of how your words will sound to another person before saying them.\n\nAdditionally, she is assumed to be white by most people. That doesn\u2019t erase her background and whatever culture you have or haven\u2019t raised her to know/participate in, but it means she hasn\u2019t experienced the same racism in public as you or this kid she was being racist to. She\u2019s grown up hearing your experiences, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s absorbed them in the same way you did. It doesn\u2019t mean she fully understands what it means to be a target of racism.\n\nWhat she did is not only racist, but hateful towards immigrants. In my opinion, simply taking away her screens and having her removed from her friend group isn\u2019t going to teach her anything properly. Screens and her friends may be part of the problem, but the real issue is her lack of empathy towards immigrants and people who look/act differently than her. If I was you, I\u2019d have her research the history of racism against all people of colour, and about hate against immigrants. Then have her explain to you specifically why what she did is feeding into that problem, and making life worse for those people. Have her look at their problems from an emotional level and put herself in their shoes. Have her write an apology to this girl, stating why what she did was wrong in detail. Why what she said was racist, and how she\u2019s going to act in the future specifically to fix this behaviour. Then proof read it, make sure there\u2019s nothing in there of her trying to excuse her behaviour, before offering to give it to the student through the teacher/principal/etc. (the student may not want to see Katie in person, or even take the letter at all, but you should still do it). That\u2019s what I\u2019d do anyways.\n\nAlso, yes it could affect her future. Especially since she\u2019s older, and especially if this video still exists online somewhere. But she\u2019s definitely old enough to know that what she did was wrong, and that loss of opportunities in life could very well be the result of being racist and participating in assaulting someone. She\u2019s either in grade 10-11 right now if she\u2019s 16, there\u2019s no excuse for her behaviour. If she loses opportunities because of this, that\u2019s her own fault and she just has to deal with the consequences of her actions. You\u2019re lucky the parents of this kid haven\u2019t pressed charges.
