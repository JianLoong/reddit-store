She already hoodwinked you into watching her kid for far longer than you planned on doing it.

The poor kid must be freaking out. \n\nJust cut your losses and get her out of your life.", "How can she be your FRIEND when you not even know her child\u2019s name?", "NTA for wanting something, but there is no way you get anything. \n\nBetter option is to use this as a learning lesson, and stop associating with her. You're clearly not that close, and you're better off not having her in your life.", "Sounds to me like she abandoned her child.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I don't know of a tactful way of asking for compensation in this situation.  It sucks that she dumped him on you, though.  I just would take this as a lesson and not help out in the future.", "NTA and I hope she pays you.  That sounds AWFUL.  i wouldn't speak to her again.", "NTA. Your friend seems to see you as less of a friend and more of a person she can use. It would be one thing if you knew her kid but she didn\u2019t even tell you he\u2019s non-verbal and you\u2019ve only met him once? I\u2019d forget about the payment AND this \u201cfriend\u201d cut your losses and never let it happen again. Wild that she ubered you home instead of asking you to watch her child somewhere nearby the appointment location too not knowing if your home was kid friendly. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this.", "No you are not the asshole for asking for some type of compensation. She didn't tell you her son was coming, left you with him, and then he proceeded to take your hotspot and bananas. Hotspot is not cheap, charge her....", "ESH. \n\nIt's awful she dumped her kid on you and ghosted for 3 hours. She should have planned for child care. I suspect you were the plan and you just didn't know you were the plan. She's an AH for doing this to you and her child. \n\nI think asking for compensation would make sense if she had called you to watch him for an afternoon. This isn't how this happened. You thought you were helping with her present but she dumped the kid on you. As a friend, I'd tell her that you felt blindsided and that you won't be doing this again. I personally wouldn't charge but I do empathize with having this kid dropped on you. \n\nI also wouldn't consider her a friend. You should know your friend's kid's name. Otherwise this is just an acquaintance.", "\n\nShe asked you for support and you said yes, you probably should have asked for more information the second you saw the kid with her.\n\nYou need to own your part on this and take it as a lesson\n\nEdit; she was in the wrong yes, but you won\u2019t get anything, just be done", "How do you meet someone's child and not ask their name?  From one human being to another I wouldn't have had to be babysitting him to ask his name?  It's so weird that you are claiming the mother never referred to the child by name in your presence and I am surprised no one mentioned this.  Literally the first thing you do when someone says I had a baby is ask it's name.  I don't think we have all the information here at all but no you don't deserve to get paid. Nobody kidnapped you and you could have said no anytime.", "ESH. Y\u2019all clearly aren\u2019t friends if you don\u2019t even know her kids name or that\u2019s he nonverbal. \n\nYou should have not agreed to take care of him if you weren\u2019t comfortable.", "YTA. \n\nDoing a solid for a friend is part of the deal. \n\nOr does friend, like love on a reality show, get thrown around too casually now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I wouldn't worry about the friendship, she used you, she'd do it again.\n\nYou're NTA to ask for compensation, but don't hold your breath.", "Absolutely ABSOLUTELY NTA! Why tf wouldn't your friend explain to you that he was non-verbal and had aggressive behaviors. I truly feel for her son. I am autistic (assuming your friend's son is too due to him being non-verbal and all that). I may be verbal and all that but my life is still pretty hard so i can't imagine how hard it is for him. He is not able to communicate his needs and it is so frustrating for him. I think that is why he is being aggressive. It is extremely irresponsible of her to not give you that information. Poor kid.", "Nta", "Yea, I felt bad cause there\u2019s definitely nothing here for him to do. He just had his iPad & snacks. He kept getting into my stuff I was trying so hard not to be upset. I love kids but it was unexpected. She finally came to get him, but I\u2019m definitely not doing it again.", "She doesn\u2019t talk about him when we\u2019re together. She\u2019s always talking about anything else. We met thru work, she was being bullied by the others & quit & I hung out with her a few times after because we have some things in common.

Yes there was an inconvenience, so I wasn\u2019t going to just tell her no, but it messed up my day. & ruined my mood a bit too.", "No, because a friend would be upfront. A friend would say, \u201cHey, I really need your help. Could you please watch my kid for a few hours while I hit up my appointment.\u201d A good mom might even tell her his name and bring some comfort items or suggest how to take care of her child best. This woman is neither a friend now a good mother, but a manipulator.", "It's super unresponsible is what it is.\n\nI have a non verbal child.  I am very careful who I leave them with because my child can't tell me what happens to them.", "It seems you guys were never really friends to begin with. You were just co workers and that was pretty much the end of your relationship. NTA but I feel as your chance of getting a compensation is pretty low but it doesn't hurt to ask. Worse thing is she'll say no and come up with excuses and you can just not talk to her ever again.", "And when she said 'can you watch my son for a few minutes' it didn't occur to you to ask his name? Just 'C'mon, boy. Get in the car'?\n\nSo weird.", "Funny, but is that what you think happened?  I mean, they weren't close, she didn't even know how old her child was or that he was non-verbal.  She didn't ask her to watch him, she just said, please come and then she was watching her kid.  a child she had no idea how to handle.  That is some irresponsible parenting and friendship", "\"ruined my mood a bit too.\" \n\nBig picture? \n\nIf your friend just uses you, then let them go. \n\nIf it is just this one time, well, your car may break down somewhere over a holiday. \n\nAnd the AAA guy is looking kind of sketchy.....", "Lol I don\u2019t have a car but thanks for the wishes\ud83e\udd70"]}
