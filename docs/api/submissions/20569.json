Her husband was getting comments like \u201cyou\u2019re a lucky man\u201d, as if it was his wedding day. \n\nTowards the end of the night, her and I finally crossed paths. And I made a half - joking comment to her \u201cyou\u2019re stealing my shine! I thought this was my wedding\u201d. I could tell she wasn\u2019t amused, she didn\u2019t smile. She did politely say I was a beautiful bride. When she walked back to her husband she started whispering to him.\n\nThis morning my husband informed me his friend told him what I said.

So let me get this straight, this woman's crime in your eyes is the fact that she existed in the same space as you. \n\nYou also owe your husband a HUGE apology, because instead of being happy that you're married or anything of the like, your number one takeaway from your and his' wedding was that someone prettier than you existed.\n\nAlso consider that this lady probably didn't want all this attention, her reaction to your comment practically confirms that.

Oh dear \ud83d\ude2c  I'm not sure this is real, it's so clueless. What do you even mean, it was 'just a throwaway comment'?! \n\nIt doesn't matter what type of comment it was, in your mind. Any words you use (no matter how you categorise them), can reveal your true thoughts and attitudes - and so offend people, when they ARE offensive. You're just trying to minimise. Even though you call it a 'throwaway comment', you managed to transmit your deepest insecurities in it. And even though you give us spiel about how you don't blame her, blah blah blah...clearly you do. \n\nBecause you put the blame on HER, for the situation ('YOU'RE stealing my shine'). And since at a wedding, it's bad manners to deliberately steal the bride's thunder, I imagine she did feel offended you were accusing her of a social faux pas, that she WASN'T actually trying to commit - along with making it clear you were jealous and annoyed about it (and stating SHE was the source of the problem). \n\nYou weren't blaming the MEN who were pursuing a married woman. You didn't go up to them, and say 'you're making me feel insecure about my looks, flirting with her rather than me.' Oh no. It was HER you put the blame on, for your insecurity and jealousy. There will ALWAYS be better-looking people than you (which doesn't magically change, just because it's your wedding). \n\nIndeed, why did you even want the other men there to dance with you, drink with you, tell you how hot you are, etc.?! You were meant to be marrying your HUSBAND (you'd think on your wedding day at least, you'd only have eyes for him). And many men would realise it's particularly tacky to flirt with/make a pass at the bride, anyway. \n\nYou need to mature. It's quite frankly a bit pathetic, to vocalise your jealousy/insecurity (even at your wedding) about a woman better-looking than you. I personally compliment people for their appearance, and I'm pleased for them when they look nice (even when I consider their looks superior to mine). That's because I personally don't base my sense of self-worth or sense of my own attractiveness, on trying to relegate the 'competition'.", "Oh my God! Your poor husband!\nIf he's got any sense he shouldn't just walk away from you. He should RUN!\nYTA....and a big one at that.", "When I was an older teen, there was a girl in our group of friends that was gorgeous; natural blonde, brainy, lovely person. I remember us having a chat one day and I was saying how annoying it was when guys were surprised I was very intelligent. At the time I was tall, natural copper hair, hour glass figure with long legs and not unattractive.... she was leagues ahead of me! And she opened up about how hard it was being her. That she was judged as stupid as well, that guys would flock to her, girls hated her, everyone judge her, just cause of how she looked. You could see how hard being that beautiful was to a very intelligent, lovely person. \nOP, she did nothing other than exist, it's not her fault people are fools and not think how inappropriate their actions were at your wedding. Please apologise and do say you realise the problem was others not her. They treated her like a bloody prize pony to fawn over. Think how much she must hate it. Then to get you saying that too? Victim blaming? Not your finest hour.", "YTA. It seems like you are extremely jealous of her and paid her way too much attention when she did nothing wrong. That wasn\u2019t a joking comment that was a comment made because of your bitter internal thoughts and it was childish.

And the wife also.  A bit of grace would have gone a long way here.\n\nYour husband should have handled it better - even though you are the AH, again, a bit of grace and addressing it like an adult - \"hey, new wife, we had a long day and I get that maybe a bit of insecurity popped up.

Have you considered she\u2019s tired of only being seen for her looks? That she\u2019s uncomfortable with the attention? \n\nYour bitterness is distracting you from the fact that she\u2019s an actual person. Being only seen for your appearance isn\u2019t fun.

I spent a large portion of my adolescence training myself not to attract attention to my physical body (after drawing inappropriate attention from older men at a very young age), as an adult it\u2019s a struggle to be taken seriously in professional spaces, when dating people parade me around like a show horse and I can never tell if they care for me or just want to possess me, in relationships partners get jealous and point out the stares as if I have any control over the behavior of others, and friends point out ways they feel I\u2019m treated differently in public. Meanwhile I have the same amount of insecurity, trauma and anxiety as anyone else. Looking this way didn\u2019t prevent me from ending up in an abusive relationship, it didn\u2019t change that I was my dad\u2019s sole caregiver and advocate during his decline and death, it doesn\u2019t take away my desire for true love and commitment. Being blamed for how I look just compounds all that. I have a big personality but I keep myself contained in a pretty small box in how I physically present. I struggle to dress up and make myself look nice for social events with friends. I never learned how to do makeup or blow dry my hair, I have never dyed my hair. My true friends have encouraged me to expand my fashion and show off a bit (now that I\u2019m 38 lol might as well live a little yeesh). My partner loves when I wear dresses and I wear them almost exclusively when I\u2019m with him bc I feel safe with him and I like doing that for him. This is all related to this pretty privilege. If a bride said those things to me, it would probably trigger a depression cycle. I might get downvoted but I\u2019m just being honest. This woman thought she was safe at a friend\u2019s wedding.
