All of my husband\u2019s friends were trying to flatter her, not me. They wanted to dance with her and drink with her. Her husband was getting comments like \u201cyou\u2019re a lucky man\u201d, as if it was his wedding day. \n\nTowards the end of the night, her and I finally crossed paths. And I made a half - joking comment to her \u201cyou\u2019re stealing my shine! I thought this was my wedding\u201d. I could tell she wasn\u2019t amused, she didn\u2019t smile. She did politely say I was a beautiful bride. When she walked back to her husband she started whispering to him.\n\nThis morning my husband informed me his friend told him what I said. My husband told me it was \u201cimmature\u201d of me. He said these are his guests and I embarrassed him. I feel like I can\u2019t possibility in the wrong. It was a throwaway comment.

So let me get this straight, this woman's crime in your eyes is the fact that she existed in the same space as you. \n\nYou also owe your husband a HUGE apology, because instead of being happy that you're married or anything of the like, your number one takeaway from your and his' wedding was that someone prettier than you existed.\n\nAlso consider that this lady probably didn't want all this attention, her reaction to your comment practically confirms that.

Oh dear \ud83d\ude2c  I'm not sure this is real, it's so clueless. What do you even mean, it was 'just a throwaway comment'?! \n\nIt doesn't matter what type of comment it was, in your mind. Any words you use (no matter how you categorise them), can reveal your true thoughts and attitudes - and so offend people, when they ARE offensive. You're just trying to minimise. Even though you call it a 'throwaway comment', you managed to transmit your deepest insecurities in it. And even though you give us spiel about how you don't blame her, blah blah blah...clearly you do. \n\nBecause you put the blame on HER, for the situation ('YOU'RE stealing my shine'). And since at a wedding, it's bad manners to deliberately steal the bride's thunder, I imagine she did feel offended you were accusing her of a social faux pas, that she WASN'T actually trying to commit - along with making it clear you were jealous and annoyed about it (and stating SHE was the source of the problem). \n\nYou weren't blaming the MEN who were pursuing a married woman. You didn't go up to them, and say 'you're making me feel insecure about my looks, flirting with her rather than me.' Oh no. It was HER you put the blame on, for your insecurity and jealousy. There will ALWAYS be better-looking people than you (which doesn't magically change, just because it's your wedding). \n\nIndeed, why did you even want the other men there to dance with you, drink with you, tell you how hot you are, etc.?! You were meant to be marrying your HUSBAND (you'd think on your wedding day at least, you'd only have eyes for him). And many men would realise it's particularly tacky to flirt with/make a pass at the bride, anyway. \n\nYou need to mature. It's quite frankly a bit pathetic, to vocalise your jealousy/insecurity (even at your wedding) about a woman better-looking than you. I personally compliment people for their appearance, and I'm pleased for them when they look nice (even when I consider their looks superior to mine). That's because I personally don't base my sense of self-worth or sense of my own attractiveness, on trying to relegate the 'competition'.", "Oh my God! Your poor husband!\nIf he's got any sense he shouldn't just walk away from you. He should RUN!\nYTA....and a big one at that.", "When I was an older teen, there was a girl in our group of friends that was gorgeous; natural blonde, brainy, lovely person. I remember us having a chat one day and I was saying how annoying it was when guys were surprised I was very intelligent. At the time I was tall, natural copper hair, hour glass figure with long legs and not unattractive.... she was leagues ahead of me! And she opened up about how hard it was being her. That she was judged as stupid as well, that guys would flock to her, girls hated her, everyone judge her, just cause of how she looked. You could see how hard being that beautiful was to a very intelligent, lovely person. \nOP, she did nothing other than exist, it's not her fault people are fools and not think how inappropriate their actions were at your wedding. Please apologise and do say you realise the problem was others not her. They treated her like a bloody prize pony to fawn over. Think how much she must hate it. Then to get you saying that too? Victim blaming? Not your finest hour.", "YTA. It seems like you are extremely jealous of her and paid her way too much attention when she did nothing wrong. That wasn\u2019t a joking comment that was a comment made because of your bitter internal thoughts and it was childish.

And the wife also.  A bit of grace would have gone a long way here.\n\nYour husband should have handled it better - even though you are the AH, again, a bit of grace and addressing it like an adult - \"hey, new wife, we had a long day and I get that maybe a bit of insecurity popped up.

Have you considered she\u2019s tired of only being seen for her looks? That she\u2019s uncomfortable with the attention? \n\nYour bitterness is distracting you from the fact that she\u2019s an actual person. Being only seen for your appearance isn\u2019t fun.

That\u2019s how idiotic you sound being angry at someone who has no control over her looks. \n\nGrow some self confidence and learn that looks attract, but personality keeps, and once looks fade, you\u2019ll still be on top of you\u2019re a decent person.", "YTA.\n\nImagine being jealous of another woman for merely existing.\n\nShe can't control what other men do.  TBH, it sounds like you were jealous that other men weren't coming up to you saying how good you looked.  This was all about your ego, nothing else.", "YTA", "YTA- you made a nothing situation into an awkward moment and probably made her feel like crap for existing. Your insecurities on your wedding day are not her issue. She didn\u2019t wear a white dress and steal the show\u2026 she danced and spent the night with her husband", ">She is not responsible for other people\u2019s behavior.\n\nI'm sure she's also really, really sick of people constantly focusing on her appearance. Especially when people act as though she's being gorgeous *at* them.\n\nI can understand why you felt a bit miffed OP, but YTA for saying what you did. Should she have worn a paper bag over her head? You should apologise.", "I agree with your assessment and want to add\u2026\n\nOP - If YOU couldn\u2019t deal with her natural beauty interfering with YOUR attention at YOUR wedding, then YOU shouldn\u2019t have invited her. This is totally a YOU problem and she is justified in being upset with you.\n\nAnd YOU are the AH. YTA", "No, no! She also had a pulse in a public place!", "And was their gift too much, too?", "In an odd way, I feel bad for OP. On what should have been the happiest day of her life, she chose to spend it feeling insecure about a woman who had wronged her in no way whatsoever. OP, your wedding should be about professing your love for your partner, not about basking in some sort of \u201cshine.\u201d\n\nOh, and YTA", "Yep personally I find it worrying that the bride was upset that men weren't drooling over her on her wedding day when the only persons attention she should be after is her partners \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Exactly.", "This exactly. It says a lot about OP that she\u2019s supposedly marrying the love of her life and she\u2019s instead focused on her own jealousy. She ruined her own day with her insecurity, and then tried to make an innocent woman feel shitty over it. Childish.", "And honestly people who are really pretty are really pretty no matter what. They can wake up hungover and still be pretty. They can wear a clown nose and still be a stunner.\n\nOP needs to work on not being insecure.", "Yep.  I would have felt so uncomfortable if I were her, having so many of my husband\u2019s friends openly slobbering over me like that.  And then to have to bride blame me for it?  Gross", "Yeah I was waiting for the part where the already gorgeous guest wore a wedding gown too or fished for attention or something like other AITA subjects, but nope, she just existed at a wedding she was invited to, and behaved as any other supportive guest, only to be aggressively jabbed at by the bride. YTA.", "I have a friend like this from uni like she could genuinely be a model after she just rolled out of bed, and she also is a lovely person to boot which is so rude \ud83d\ude1b\n\nBut yeah she is so sick and tired of this. I remember all through uni... she goes out rock climbing with guys she's been friends with for years and overhears them making crude comments about her body. She'll very clearly communicate to guys that she is happily engaged and not engage with any flirting or shut it down and they'll complain they're in the friendzone or say they'll wait for her or ignore her rebuffs completely \ud83e\udd22 she never does anything to encourage these guys and shuts them down and distances herself as soon as they start acting like that but I know she finds it annoying because it happens so often.", "But if she didn\u2019t have that pulse, everybody would be crawling all over her to do CPR. So still, her mistake. \n\nNo. Yta. If you can\u2019t feel the spotlight on your wedding day because you\u2019re too busy with someone else getting attention- you ruined your own day.", "Pray for the poor guy that has to deal with this woman.  Couldn\u2019t be me."]}
