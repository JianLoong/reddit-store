Her husband was getting comments like \u201cyou\u2019re a lucky man\u201d, as if it was his wedding day. \n\nTowards the end of the night, her and I finally crossed paths. And I made a half - joking comment to her \u201cyou\u2019re stealing my shine! I thought this was my wedding\u201d. I could tell she wasn\u2019t amused, she didn\u2019t smile. She did politely say I was a beautiful bride. When she walked back to her husband she started whispering to him.\n\nThis morning my husband informed me his friend told him what I said.

So let me get this straight, this woman's crime in your eyes is the fact that she existed in the same space as you. \n\nYou also owe your husband a HUGE apology, because instead of being happy that you're married or anything of the like, your number one takeaway from your and his' wedding was that someone prettier than you existed.\n\nAlso consider that this lady probably didn't want all this attention, her reaction to your comment practically confirms that.

Oh dear \ud83d\ude2c  I'm not sure this is real, it's so clueless. What do you even mean, it was 'just a throwaway comment'?! \n\nIt doesn't matter what type of comment it was, in your mind. Any words you use (no matter how you categorise them), can reveal your true thoughts and attitudes - and so offend people, when they ARE offensive. You're just trying to minimise. Even though you call it a 'throwaway comment', you managed to transmit your deepest insecurities in it. And even though you give us spiel about how you don't blame her, blah blah blah...clearly you do. \n\nBecause you put the blame on HER, for the situation ('YOU'RE stealing my shine'). And since at a wedding, it's bad manners to deliberately steal the bride's thunder, I imagine she did feel offended you were accusing her of a social faux pas, that she WASN'T actually trying to commit - along with making it clear you were jealous and annoyed about it (and stating SHE was the source of the problem). \n\nYou weren't blaming the MEN who were pursuing a married woman. You didn't go up to them, and say 'you're making me feel insecure about my looks, flirting with her rather than me.' Oh no. It was HER you put the blame on, for your insecurity and jealousy. There will ALWAYS be better-looking people than you (which doesn't magically change, just because it's your wedding). \n\nIndeed, why did you even want the other men there to dance with you, drink with you, tell you how hot you are, etc.?! You were meant to be marrying your HUSBAND (you'd think on your wedding day at least, you'd only have eyes for him). And many men would realise it's particularly tacky to flirt with/make a pass at the bride, anyway. \n\nYou need to mature. It's quite frankly a bit pathetic, to vocalise your jealousy/insecurity (even at your wedding) about a woman better-looking than you. I personally compliment people for their appearance, and I'm pleased for them when they look nice (even when I consider their looks superior to mine). That's because I personally don't base my sense of self-worth or sense of my own attractiveness, on trying to relegate the 'competition'.", "Oh my God! Your poor husband!\nIf he's got any sense he shouldn't just walk away from you. He should RUN!\nYTA....and a big one at that.", "When I was an older teen, there was a girl in our group of friends that was gorgeous; natural blonde, brainy, lovely person. I remember us having a chat one day and I was saying how annoying it was when guys were surprised I was very intelligent. At the time I was tall, natural copper hair, hour glass figure with long legs and not unattractive.... she was leagues ahead of me! And she opened up about how hard it was being her. That she was judged as stupid as well, that guys would flock to her, girls hated her, everyone judge her, just cause of how she looked. You could see how hard being that beautiful was to a very intelligent, lovely person. \nOP, she did nothing other than exist, it's not her fault people are fools and not think how inappropriate their actions were at your wedding. Please apologise and do say you realise the problem was others not her. They treated her like a bloody prize pony to fawn over. Think how much she must hate it. Then to get you saying that too? Victim blaming? Not your finest hour.", "YTA. It seems like you are extremely jealous of her and paid her way too much attention when she did nothing wrong. That wasn\u2019t a joking comment that was a comment made because of your bitter internal thoughts and it was childish.

And the wife also.  A bit of grace would have gone a long way here.\n\nYour husband should have handled it better - even though you are the AH, again, a bit of grace and addressing it like an adult - \"hey, new wife, we had a long day and I get that maybe a bit of insecurity popped up.

Have you considered she\u2019s tired of only being seen for her looks? That she\u2019s uncomfortable with the attention? \n\nYour bitterness is distracting you from the fact that she\u2019s an actual person. Being only seen for your appearance isn\u2019t fun.

Dudes really have no shame sometimes.", "[deleted]", "She literally spent the entire time focusing on this other woman who wasn\u2019t even doing anything to her. And then had the nerve to confront her about her, again, doing literally nothing.", "I meant the opposite by \u201cin a cocktail dress with her hair down\u201d. I meant that she managed to upstage me in a simple dress with simple hair.", "Right? Like wtf that was such a weird thing to say on OP\u2019s part. The only person she should care about salivating over her is her new husband.", "\"But, why didn't all your friends spend the night trying to fuck meeeeee? It's my wedding, not hers!\"\n\n- OP probably", "I thought that was weird! Like girl\u2026didn\u2019t you just get married?? Why would you want your HUSBAND\u2019S friends to flatter/hit on you? That\u2019s so weird.", "Yet another AH that wants the Main Character Moment more than the relationship. Imagine wanting to be treated like a piece of meat while you are marrying the man you love. Not the greatest start for a marriage.", "To be fair, they shouldn't be trying to flirt with another married woman either.", "So much this!", "I assume it is not if both parties are consenting.\n\nEven otherwise inappropriate behavior can be NOT harassment if both parties agree with it. And there is flattery and \"flattery\".\n\nIf we go dancing with several other couples and our male friends tell us we look stunning, it feels good and is absolutely not harassment (they do not do anything sleazy, just say we look good, and they say it openly and to all of us).", "I thought harassment was when you continue to do something after you were asked to stop.", "...\"Genie in a Bottle\" at the groom.", "Because he felt his wife was called out for nothing. Was the woman supposed to clap back at the bride on her wedding day? We don\u2019t know that she asked her husband to say anything. Op wanted to be snarky for no reason, that tends to come back at you. FAFO.", "I wonder if the groom even knows. But yeah, \"I wanted all your friends to try and seduce ME at OUR wedding\" is an impossibly bad look.", "Cross paths was poor word choice. It was our first 1 on 1 interaction.", "Already answered. And yes, she and my husband\u2019s friends were around me since they were around my husband.", "In this case, I think they are both fine. She\u2019s jealous because she felt threatened and insecure that all of the attention was taken from her on her special day. She\u2019s envious of the woman and the fact that she got all of the attention instead of her (the bride).", "Look up the page that discusses the nuances of envy vs jealousy\n\n\nThey basically say you can still use jealousy", "Your husband\u2019s weird friends trying to hit on her didn\u2019t upstage you. You\u2019re the bride, I\u2019m sure your family and friends and people that matter were focused on you and your husband. If you had focused on celebrating yourself and your husband at your own wedding, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have even noticed what was going on.", "She's also probably a nice person, so she's got you there too.", ">upstage me\n\nOP, did you read all the comments on this thread and still couldn't figure it out? Do you understand why you're still the bride? Why other people cannot control other's reactions? And why you've been living in this strange narcissistic Disney princess fantasy of \"I have to be the most beautiful princess on my wedding day\"?", "Ok and? Lmao?", "Yes because she's more beautiful than you, in outer and inner beauty. She's not trynna steal any limelight, that shows how considerate she was. \n\nYou on the other hand, definitely way uglier inside", "I do not know how non/atractive you are, but you are ugly inside. And bitter- YTA", "Lmao!", "\"But it's MY wedding!!!!!!!!\"", "Exactly. She may or may not have asked her husband to come to her defense. We don\u2019t know. For all we know the woman is plain mortified at her husband\u2019s behavior and that what she thought was a private convo between them got back to the bride.", "I meant is this woman also close friends with your husband\u2019s friends? Maybe they all went to college together or whatever?", "I mean. The bride is in the wrong here. So does the rest even matter? I just feel bad for the poor woman who can\u2019t go anywhere without people making comments about and to her."]}
