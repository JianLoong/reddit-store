Super disruptive for a \u201cnew\u201d sibling to be added into the mix at such a young age, particularly one who is grieving and ripped away from everything that he knew. Based on what you\u2019ve said, it sounds like this kid was news to your dad, so I appreciate that they may not have prepped you in a way that worked because they were likely wrapping their head around it.\n\nWhat I see as a big ol\u2019 responsibility of theirs is creating safety for you and your siblings in your home. That it took three years for your brother to be removed is wild - your parents must have seen he wasn\u2019t acclimating, so why didn\u2019t they start exploring relatives for him to go live with? It sounds like they tried to be so upbeat about it that they ignored his abusive behaviours.\n\nAnd they\u2019re right, he\u2019s the one who said those things, but he was a teenager. One who just lost his mom, then left his home to be around a father that he had never had a connection with before. All of this actions would have been coloured by this devastating emotional experience. Your parents were responsible for helping him heal and to mitigate all of the abuse he threw out in the process.\n\nI hope your parents can reflect and take some of the responsibility one day. I don\u2019t think it would heal how you experience the world, but I think it could help your relationship with them.", "Seems they\u2019ve rewrote history because they failed at trying to make him join the family and now you telling them how that experience was for you.", "NTA you, your siblings and half Brother are all victims of your shitty parents. He Made it clear that He wanted to stay with his Family after his Mom died and your parents forced him into your Home to Play some kind of freaking Happy Family.\n\nMost likely they wanted to establish themself as Saints who took in the poor Boy after His Mom died and showed him what a 'real' Family Looks like. They used you and your siblings to 'bully' (sry can't find another Term cause for him it was like that but for you not) him. \n\nAfter your teacher stepped up (Bless him) and cps finally brought him back where He belongs, your parents bubble popped and they became bitter. No Saints, cps involveld = people will Side eye them= half Brother ruined everything\n\nPlease keep Up with the Therapy and when you are at a good Point, how about writing him a Letter in which you exactly tell everything and how you don't see him as the one to destroy everything, It's your parents fault and you Wish him a Happy Life. He doesn't need to Response but i think He is also scarred deep down and it will serve as an ending for both of you", ">  When they brought up my half brother during this call I told them their actions did more harm than his did, because I wouldn't have cared as much about his arrival had they just told me he was coming and hadn't encouraged me to ignore what he wanted.\n\nFor that matter, if they hadn't insisted he come to live with them full time when he already *had* a stable family, literally none of this would've happened at all. He could've visited during vacations and gotten to know you all that way, and that would've been better for all you kids.\n\n>  They became angry and told me they hadn't treated me like shit or said all those awful things to me.\n\nNo, but they treated him badly - and if I'm reading this right, after he went back home they basically cut off contact with him completely? FFS.\n\nYou're very much NTA. You're just telling them the truth. They don't want to hear it now the same way they didn't want to hear it when you were a kid, but that's not your fault.\n\nI hope your half-brother is doing all right now, wherever he is.", "Your half brother was 13, ripped away from his family to live with strangers.  Your parents were horrible people to him.  And then the built it up in your head that he would be thrilled, so yea, they were horrible people to you too.  Your parents are definitely the assholes.", "NTA, your parents are horrible. Not only did a horrible job with your siblings and you, but fucked everything up with a teenage boy who had lost his mom, didn't know his so-called \"new family\" and was blamed afterwards by them for behaving as many of us would have done in his situation. Your parents are awful, don't let them convince you otherwise.", "NTA. Seems like they are the ones who need therapy\u2026", "NTA\n\nJust so you know--you did not do anything wrong during those 3 yrs(you may not have done things \"right\" for half-bro--but you were trying the best you could).\n\nthat said, your parents are AH's for lying/hyping to you.  For Expecting a grieving 13 yr old to just meld with your family.  I cannot even imagine the anger and frustration of being torn from his KNOWN world.  I realize your half-bro doesn't know it, but good for you for speaking your(and his truth).\n\nPretty sure I read an AITA recently that had the Aunt/Uncle's perspective on this situation--a halfsibling turning up and the chaos from the parents wanting to do the perfect blended family without dealing with the kid's trauma of losing only known parent and THEN their extended/known family.", "INFO:\n\ndo you know why he was taken away from the other relatives initially?", "YTA. First, your observation is moot. Your parents have an obligation to you, absolutely, but your father had an obligation to your half brother. They were overly enthusiastic with you, but that's a clinical observation, not a family dynamic observation. The most effective way to integrate your brother into your family was to make him feel welcome, which unfortunately included you. That failed, and it sucks for you that it failed. But that doesn't mean it wasn't the best option available. They aren't assholes just because that failed, and the reason it failed is your brother, not them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I hope you half brother finally got the family he loved after all the angst and hurt.", "NTA.  Sorry your parents and half brother are AHs", "They were never planning to find another place for him. if they had their way, they would have kept him in the home, continued to encourage me to chase a relationship with him, because at no point did it stop while he was living there. Even when it came to something like a new video game being brought into the house, they would say he loves video games and I should play with him and bring him his favorite snack to do that with. Though they didn't know that kind of stuff about him. They basically just threw ideas of what he liked around hoping something would stick.\n\nIf I had not spoke to my teacher back then, he would have been in the home for another two years if the police didn't end up needing to be involved.\n\nPart of the issue with my parents is they thought they could love him into wanting to know any of us. They really believed he was speaking just out of hurt when he said he wanted to leave. They refused to believe he might actually want to be with the family he knew vs us. He was in therapy for several years but they sent him with the hope he would heal and open up his mind. They tried a few different therapists too when they weren't happy with the results.\n\nI hope they can too some day, but I don't see either of them putting that much consideration into their actions.", "Yeah, there's a lot of that going on for sure. More than anything I feel like they want to make sure nobody turns it all around on them. They feel like they were totally right and none of what happened was on them. When that has never been true.", "I wouldn't know where to send a letter to him honestly. Even if I wanted to, and honestly I don't really. I feel better not reaching out to him. Feels like it would be a waste of time and would maybe just stir bad blood up again. But I am definitely sticking with therapy. I have too much to work through to quit before I can have a happier life.", "The half brother absolutely is not a victim. Wanting your circumstances to be different doesn't justify abuse. He's absolutely an asshole in this scenario.", "I hope so too. Not sure where he ended up exactly but I know he was going where he wanted to be so I hope that helped him.\n\nTechnically, no, they did try to stay in touch but he made it clear he didn't want them to know exactly where he went. They sent letters via the social worker I remember. I think they even tried to get me to write one. But there has been no real contact since the day he left.", "What exactly did OP's parents do that was horrible to the brother? I don't see it.", "From what I overheard, they were not biologically or legally his relatives and that played a huge role in it. From what I remember hearing his mom was a foster kid who had found siblings in the system but they weren't ever adopted together or anything and they weren't bio relatives, just bonded and became siblings through the stuff they went through. But I only picked up stuff and I was little.", "The therapist hopping says it all. I usually don\u2019t work with kids, but when I have, parents try to be heavily involved as if therapy is about changing the kid into what they want, regardless of what the child wants. And when I would say \u201cwell, I don\u2019t change people into who they don\u2019t want to be\u201d, parents would become angry, then rude, then would disappear forever.\n\nIt sounds like your parents were thinking they were the saviours for him to heal and feel full in the world. Perhaps it was this arrogance that led to them ignoring what he truly wanted and needed.", "Perhaps you telling them some hard to hear truths will open them up to idea they f\\*\\*\\*d up. Maybe not and it will just mess your relationship with them, but it seems it's already not a great one. Either way, NTA for telling them how you experienced their upbringing.", "How did you and your siblings deal with the fallout? Did all of you cut off your parents? The half sibling cut all of you off too I assume? I can't say I blame him for his anger but he lashed out on young children. You were 10 years old when he finally moved out. Your parents deserve nothing from him though. NTA", "Yeah just Sometimes i've heard that this yould Serve as an ending to stop pending Feelings, you also don't need to send the Letter to him ,just write it down. \n\nMy therapist says, writing things down helps to let go of the Feelings build up and not beeing adressed. Or to reflect on things, see a different perspective because sometimes it helps to read it as a neutral space (Like treating it as a Strangers writing)", "He was a grieving child taken from the only family he knew and put with strangers who knew nothing about him and weren't willing to learn.

They don't even remember him really. The only reason they really know about him is because our parents mentioned him so often and blamed him. So they know there is a half brother out there who hated us and was taken away by CPS after living with us for three years.\n\nMy siblings are still minors so they still live with our parents. Yeah, I haven't heard a thing from him since and I don't think we will ever be in contact again.", "Oh, that's not a bad idea. My therapist had me do something similar to the younger me.", "OP's parents didn't kill his mom. Who victimized him? I think you are reading things into the story that aren't said. OP's dad didn't just take him to take him, very likely the other relatives didn't want to take him.  Him grieving doesn't justify the abuse he was causing others. Literally no one in the story deserved what he was doing.", "It technically was. My dad did get the choice to say no but he didn't want to. He and my mom wanted him here and didn't really care what my half brother wanted.", "Yes that's what i do. Because i'm impulsive and Break down a Lot. She told me to write the Situations up and look at them from another perspective. It helps me to See another view of myself and i can try to look into Things to react otherwise or take it better"]}
