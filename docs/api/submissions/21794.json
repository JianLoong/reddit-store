For those who don't know, medical information is protected by a law called HIPAA, and it is pretty strict about how patient information needs to be protected and anonymized if sharing is needed. I've reminded my wife several times that she is telling me patient details that are in violation of HIPAA. She keeps brushing it off, first by telling me that HIPAA doesn't apply between spouses (it absolutely does), and then by telling me that she trusts me and needs me to just listen to her (that's not the point). I've repeatedly tried to explain to her why she needs to stop, but she hasn't.\n\nA few days ago she told me about a patient she saw and even without names I figured out that it was the son of someone I knew and they probably wouldn't want me to know that information. I again told my wife to stop and again she brushed me off. A couple days later I was at a gathering where one of my wife's friends who is also her fellow resident was present. I pulled her aside and explained what was going on and asked her to talk with my wife about the seriousness of what she was doing. She said she would.\n\nApparently she didn't talk with my wife but reported her to the hospital's ethics board and now they want to meet with my wife. She is furious with me for reporting her and says she can't trust me anymore. I've told her I'm sorry this is happening but I didn't ask her to be reported, I just wanted someone to explain to her what she was doing was wrong because she wasn't listening when I did.

Journals only do so much and telling a therapist the same stuff as what was told to the OP would still violate HIPAA. If OP doesn\u2019t want to provide emotional support for their spouse, they should consider not having one. Ever.", "She confirmed it was who he thought it was and has agreed she is violating the law and doesn't care. *SHE agrees.* Why are you trying to pretend she is not when even she acknowledges she is.", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/spousal_privilege", "It's really appalling. And I seriously doubt that the people defending him would be okay with it if she was sharing *their* personal, private medical information in so much detail that OP could identify them!", "The fact that OP was able to identify the patient means that wife was sharing too much information", "It\u2019s possible OP could be a fellow medical professional\n\nbut given that he went to one of his wife\u2019s fellow residents, aka a competitor in the insanely competitive game that is residency, with a loaded gun to take out his wife, OP is either the absolute dumbest medical professional to ever walk the earth or a dangerously controlling husband.\n\nMy money is on the latter given he just torpedoed his wife\u2019s career path in his grand scheme to make her stop talking shop at the dinner table.", "I agree, not everything is. \n\nSabotaging a wife's residency is.", "It wasn't about gossip, it was about selling health information for money to advertisers and standardizing how medical information had to be transmitted. I doubt Congress cares about gossiping enough to pass anything to stop it.", "They value venting over the law/patient's right. TBH, if you need to vent about work to third parties, maybe that job isn't for you.", "Perhaps that\u2019s true, but your spouse shouldn\u2019t be the one holding the career murder weapon.", "Yeah, that I\u2019ll agree with. It definitely should have been handled differently.", "It's not their secrets, it's other people's private medical information.", "If it's such stressful knowledge that OP's wife *needed* to talk about it with OP, why should OP not find it too stressful to keep it to himself? In fact, that is precisely how secrets often make the rounds \u2013 one person knows, but just *has* to tell someone, and tells someone they trust, who in turn also just *has* to tell someone, and so on and so forth.\n\nBut even leaving that aside, *OP didn't want to know this stuff.* Why does his wife get a pass on forcing OP to listen to things he has repeatedly told her he doesn't want to hear?? Under any other circumstances, people here would be outraged by the intolerable imposition.", "But OP *was* upset with the things his wife shared, and repeatedly asked her to stop, and she *did* share identifiable information that allowed him to figure out who one of her patients was \u2013 and then confirmed that he had correctly deduced the patient's identity. So that's a very different situation, isn't it? \n\nWould your husband continue to tell you information you repeatedly told him you don't want to know?", "The question OP asked was is he the asshole for ratting out his wife and ruining her career, and he overwhelmingly is, regardless of if she broke HIPAA or not. He even said she didn't name names but he assumed it was someone he knew and he still decided to snitch on her. He knew what he was doing. If you admire his virtue over the vow he made to his wife to not ever purposely destroy her life, more power to you, but he made his choice and has to deal with the consequences, which should be divorce.", "Idgaf if my doctor tells their spouse about our office visit, especially if she doesn't even use my name.", "If wife shared enough info that could pinpoint who it was, thats oversharing and a violation of the law. OP says wife confirmed who it was as well.", "Still not slander despite all of the excuses that you keep making", "Wait, people lie on reddit? /s\n\nI read it as sincere but the way he types suggests a constantly anxious person who would do this kind of thing innocently.. \n\nNow that this has been planted though, I'm just gonna mute the post \ud83d\ude02you're probably right..", "Think you need to imagine yourself on the receiving end of this. I get it, loyalty means lying to benefit someone you care about to most people.\n\nLoyalty to me is continuing to be positive and keep those you're loyal to in the right and out of danger.\n\nDanger like being sued for more than you're worth. Having your career, what you spent years and years in education dedicating yourself to, taken away. Having the next 2, 5, 10 years to think about it in a cell, but go on, your sarcasm speaks volumes.", "You don't know if she's going to start saying it to someone else since he walks away. He's trying to help her. People need to understand he trusted who he told, and felt like there was no hope for him anymore. \n\nAll of em are at fault, but you're all attacking a guy who just tried to care whilst being continually made to feel neglected. \n\nWife's friend is the worst, wife is second, he barely cuts it from intent alone.", "That's amazing. (I can definitely imagine how a surgeon might have fun doing that!)", "especially the ones who ignore HIPPA or their partner's problem of hearing too much", "My main problem with the whole emotional support and venting argument is the fact that OP had boundaries and told his wife he was uncomfortable with some parts of her venting but she didn\u2019t stop and kept on pushing past his boundaries.", "No she sabotaged herself. She knew she broke the rules, OP says that she knew. She didn't care until she got bit in the ass by it. She's not that successful now lmao", "The only one sabotaging her job is herself, by violating laws", "Exactly! Go ahead and talk to your spouse about my case as much as you want, but as soon as you give enough information to make me identifiable, you\u2019ve crossed a line into unethical, illegal, territory. Technically even talking about something that happened at work today is illegal because procedure dates are considered PHI and can be enough to identify a patient.", "Unless the wife actually say \"XXX or YYY\" is the patient, it's not in actual violation of HIPAA. It's just similar to what is normally posted in medical practitioners forums or facebook groups.\n\nAt the end OP is either just tired of listening to his wife or just wants to knock the wife down a level to show her who is boss.", "She doesn\u2019t get a pass\u2026 she did not respect boundaries that OP set, and that sucks. \n\nHOWEVER, it\u2019s the way he handled it that makes him 100% an asshole! His actions have potentially damaged her career before it has officially started. That could understandably be grounds for divorce.\n\nAlternatively, he could have consulted a marriage counselor to achieve the goal he desired. He did NOT handle this well at all!", "i can't understand it either, i was just arguing w my family over it bc they kept harping he should just listen abd im like why?? he implied he was uncomfortable w it, and she kept pushing that boundary.", "She did, in fact, name names. If you read his comments, he says she confirmed that he was right. If you're OK with that happening to you, fine, but most people want their personal, private medical information to remain private. And since we're not talking about your privacy, your willingness to sacrifice it isn't exactly laudable.", "And if your doctor spoke to her spouse about your medical care in such detail that the spouse recognized you, and then confirmed that the spouse had the right person? Because that's what happened here. (And before you say 'we don't know he guessed correctly...' , we do, in fact, know that he was right. If you read his comments, he says that she confirmed he had the right person.)", "But is some communities not using name isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019m sorry, OP even said he knew someone based on description that\u2019s too much. As someone whose job has a similar privacy regulation I never describe anyone so my partner might know who they are. And I would be horrified if a person knew my medical info without my knowledge (outside the medical field and part of my casework).", "Especially the ones that betray their spouse", "He also said she confirmed the patient to him, so she unquestionably violated HIPAA.  He shouldn\u2019t have asked, but I can kind of understand a sudden \u201cwait, are you taking about [friend]?\u201d when that catches you off guard.", "That\u2019s absolutely not true - HIPAA (and similar requirements around confidentiality pretty much everywhere) covers any identifying details. \n\nFor example, a colleague posted a story about a patient in a private FB group. No name, age, or gender but the situation was specific enough and community small enough that the patient was identifiable and she was reported to the regulator, with conditions on her licence as a result.", "I can never imagine having a spouse that snitches on you. Especially over something as irrelevant as HIPAA violation between spouses. \nWow", "I didn't see that she confirmed it. Yeah, she should not have done that. I still think he's a huge asshole for ratting her out though and that was OP's original question. The only possible end to this is divorce so he shouldn't be surprised."]}
