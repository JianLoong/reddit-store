For those who don't know, medical information is protected by a law called HIPAA, and it is pretty strict about how patient information needs to be protected and anonymized if sharing is needed. I've reminded my wife several times that she is telling me patient details that are in violation of HIPAA. She keeps brushing it off, first by telling me that HIPAA doesn't apply between spouses (it absolutely does), and then by telling me that she trusts me and needs me to just listen to her (that's not the point). I've repeatedly tried to explain to her why she needs to stop, but she hasn't.\n\nA few days ago she told me about a patient she saw and even without names I figured out that it was the son of someone I knew and they probably wouldn't want me to know that information. I again told my wife to stop and again she brushed me off. A couple days later I was at a gathering where one of my wife's friends who is also her fellow resident was present. I pulled her aside and explained what was going on and asked her to talk with my wife about the seriousness of what she was doing. She said she would.\n\nApparently she didn't talk with my wife but reported her to the hospital's ethics board and now they want to meet with my wife. She is furious with me for reporting her and says she can't trust me anymore. I've told her I'm sorry this is happening but I didn't ask her to be reported, I just wanted someone to explain to her what she was doing was wrong because she wasn't listening when I did.

She\u2019s trauma venting to the one person in the world she should trust and he doesn\u2019t get that.", "Loyalty to your spouse comes first.", "A lot of people don\u2019t, but it\u2019s been happening for decades and nobody with power seems to give a fuck, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I actually do \u201cput up with this\u201d.  My boyfriend is a nurse and we have been together for 3 years. He vents to me about work and I vent to him about mine. He works three days a week and I ask him each day about how work went and I listen to him. \n\nDo you not think talking and venting about work, life, personal, etc. issues isn\u2019t a crucial part of any relationship?", "By OP\u2019s account, she told him far more than the age and gender of the patient.", "That\u2019s all accurate except that OP has made it clear gender and time of treatment were mentioned.", "You dont seem even faintly concerned that you could have kept this to yourself and the fact that you didnt has likely fucked up her career and your marriage. Very very likely. I almost think this was the outcome you wanted.\n\nYou must have known with certainty that telling another medic obliged them to report it.\n\nIf so, just telling her would have been more honest. But this way sounds like its going to be super effective regardless.", "Being technically correct is not going to save your marriage or your wife's career. I can't see how your actions are worth the consequences. If you know HIPAA so well, you'd know that her co-worker would have to report, yes? I guess you got your wish - but you've likely done a lot damage to your wife. Not just to her career, but emotionally as well. But don't worry, you were right about HIPAA and that's what matters.", "That\u2019s for health insurance providers. ( what the \u201cI\u201d stand for) Not the actual medical providers. Read your full evidence before presenting it.", "Yeah it just sounds like she\u2019s telling/ ranting to you about the challenges of dealing with that patient. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that because you\u2019re her husband and she should be able to tell you things. And unless you also work in a medical field I honestly don\u2019t see why you are so pressed about this. I really and truly don\u2019t. As I said previously l, this comes across as you just not wanting to hear about your wife\u2018s workday. So yeah you\u2019re still TA.", "You are moron.", "Which due to OPs EXTENSIVE research on HIPPA, he should have known that and ya know, not asked anymore questions.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to spend the next 30 years pretending he doesn\u2019t know stuff he shouldn\u2019t know.", "She never should have confirmed. She\u2019s still the worst in this because she wanted to be a doctor. She needed to learn a lesson, it sucks the punishment is so harsh but honestly it sounds like shes been making mistakes", "> Why have you gone over and above to \u201cstudy the hipaa laws?\u201d\n\nBecause when I asked my wife not to share patient details with me and she didn't respect that I thought I could convince her by showing her the regulations for her industry.", "I worked in one of those fields, and no, it does not happen.  Not if you care about your profession and the people who need your services.  When you have a moral and legal obligation to keep shit confidential, you either do it or you get out of the field.\n\nShe\u2019s constantly sharing inappropriate amounts of detail with her husband who has reminded her that it\u2019s wrong and asked her to stop.  He has tried to support her in her career, and she is the one who has destroyed it.", "I'm starting to think so. Is he off his meds?", "It's not a technicality if I can figure out who her patients are.", "Well, I guess she learned her lesson on who to vent to. I hope she divorces his ass, so he learns his.", "Obviously because they don\u2019t treat ANYONE like a real human w rights as long as it gives them revenue. Doesn\u2019t make it right", "It is. But it\u2019s different for everyone. And that\u2019s what gets me. They\u2019re all shitting on OP for setting boundaries and when he\u2019s ignored deliberately he\u2019s told to shut up and endure something he isn\u2019t comfortable with. Like he\u2019s a monster for not wanting to hear details daily.", "OP said in another comment she didn\u2019t give names or date of birth, just the occurrence of what she encountered.", "Yes, OP\u2019s wife was definitely violating confidentiality.  She was not doing the kind of anonymizing I\u2019ve described.", "I'm convinced he is a robot and has no emotions.", "Why don\u2019t you go ahead and link me to the rule you think you\u2019re referring to.  I\u2019m betting it\u2019s Canadian, since at least Ontario has an act by that name.  The US does not, and I assure you, HIPAA covers any entity involved in healthcare.  If you actually read the page I linked, you\u2019d see that", "HPPA is the CANADIAN law. HIPPA is the law in the UNITED STATES that does the same thing. Maybe you should take your own advice.", "> Yeah it just sounds like she\u2019s telling/ ranting to you about the challenges of dealing with that patient.\n\nIf you told this information to a friend or colleague or relative or anyone *not* involved in that patient's care it would be considered a privacy violation under HIPAA.", "When you personally have a legal duty not to do things, \u201cBut they asked!\u201d is a spectacularly shitty defense.  I worked in the legal field, where confidentiality is even more strictly observed, and I never told my husband anything I shouldn\u2019t have.  Even about the case that stirred up some of my own trauma, where I really needed support.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to offshore your responsibilities onto someone else.", "OP isn\u2019t subject to HIPAA though, his physician wife is.", "Or he could have ignored it and went about his damn business and let his wife vent about her damn stressfull-not-nearly-paid-enough job", "Well she probably wont share anything else with you from now on since youve potentially ruined her future medical career, so theres that", "You really hate that woman huh.", "Do you even like your wife? Lol \n\nShe venting to you, about her day at work, and didn\u2019t actually give out identifying information. It seems you were able to guess who it was by the fact they went to the hospital that day.", "Bro just divorce her - holy shit", "Of course it doesn\u2019t make it right, I didn\u2019t say that and I didn\u2019t see anyone else say that. You said \u201cimagine\u201d and I pointed out that we don\u2019t have to imagine, it\u2019s been going on for years, at least it\u2019s not like having your life plastered all over the world. If there is blatant proof that HIPAA laws aren\u2019t enforced, what makes you think they\u2019ll be enforced for us nobodies?", "Re-reading, the OP doesnt seem bothered with the sharing, only the concern of not following HIppa.  I dont see any evidence on the OP being under duress from the venting.", "This is the comment I am talking about:\n\n\u201cExample of what my wife is telling me: I saw a 19 year old guy on this day at this hospital with this medical condition and this was the treatment and they told me this and I said they should do this and their family has a history of this...\u201c\n\nNow, if the medical condition he was being treated for was suspected flu and the family medical history was of high cholesterol, that\u2019s sufficiently common not to be identifying.  But if the condition for which the patient was being treated is a specific and less common congenital heart defect and the family history is of ALS, that can become identifying, particularly in a smaller community.  \n\nI mean, you can\u2019t get around HIPAA to gossip about a woman you went to high school with who\u2019s being treated for chlamydia by telling your former classmates about how you saw this 35 yo female patient who grew up in the community and whose parents were a museum curator and a zoologist. At a certain point, even without a name and DOB, the information becomes identifying.", "Glad you agree :)", "Lmao just stop. You played yourself, it happens", "I totally agree, you have to sterilize the hell out of story and even then if you get caught you should expect your punishment. I wouldn\u2019t want her as a doctor if she is this gossipy about my care.", "She needs to divorce. He is the worst kind of betrayer! OP, why don't you go physicallycheat on her as well.", "She'll share divorce papers and that's about it", "Hopefully she beats him to it. He sounds exhausting"]}
