No matter what they smell, or how many people say they smell it, you smell no smells.  \n\nThere is no manner of escalation which can prove an odor exists.

Indeed it was he who should have warned you, and your reply was perfect.", "NTA... my neighbours often will let us know when they are having a big party. One had a wedding in the back yard and asked neighbors not to burn or use loud equipment that day\nThey brought gifts with their request, and I thought they were entirely reasonable. With a polite request and some forewarning - it's nice to comply to a reasonable request.", "NTA\n\nChemicals are always in the air. Your neighbor should realize this. Plus if it\u2019s such an issue, why not get a diffuser? Long term item, short term event.", "right? people forget vinegar is made of not-to-be-fucked-with strength acid lol\n\nto be fair tho \u201charsh chemicals\u201d is pretty easily understandable here as \u201cnormal\u201d herbicide [that is toxic to humans]", "Info: Can you tell me more about the vinegar? I've not heard of using vinegar for weeds before", "NTA", "NTA.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour neighbors sounds like the kind who would sue the weather channel for rain when a sunny day had been forecast.", "It's not a miracle worker some might tell you about. And you have to be careful to avoid metals. Since I just use a mix of white vinegar, salt, and dishsoap, it's not as effective as a storebought vinegar spray that uses high concentrates of vinegar. But I don't like that stuff and it's really expensive where I live. \n\nBut I use it every year as an after spray and it gets the job done. But do your research before trying it yourself. A lot of people share vinegar recipes on social media and paint as some sort of cure-all, anti-establishment, bee-saving miracle weed killer that's 100% safe for everyone. But it's not and then someone who took it for face value is dealing with exposed pipe corrosion and a bunch of other ground problems they weren't prepared for. Like everything else, you just gotta make sure it works for your needs.", "NTA\n\nJust vinegar.  It disappears fast", "NTA.  They could have advised you that there was a party going on and asked you not to do yard work...but they didn't.  I hope you got all you needed to get done!", "When their argument devolves into name-calling  and walking away you can be assured yon have come out on top, because they no longer have logic or reason with which to counter.

What your neighbors are doing in their yard has no impact on what you do in your yard.", "NTA. He didn't talk to you about his party and you didn't talk to him about your gardening schedule. You'll both live.", "NTA because you weren't going out of your way to cause a problem, but maybe be aware that though it's uncommon, vinegar is incredibly overpowering for some people. For me it's just as strong and unpleasant as undiluted bleach (I would even pick bleach over vinegar if I had to choose a smell), I can't be in the same room as someone using a vinegar-based dressing and it's all I can ever smell and taste in ketchup.", "NTA- I am intrigued by this vinegar spray less harsh chemicals as I have sensitive kiddos and a yard of weeds.  \n\nWhat's the mix?", "NTA OP- this would fit perfectly with r/AmITheGrasshole", "For sure. If they'd given me a heads-up, assuming they've had this multi-day gathering planned for a while, I would have figured something out or done it last weekend if I could have. I'm always happy to be amiable. Never trying to go out of my way to ruin someone's day.", "Im sorry you lost your sense of smell. I lost mine for about a year due to covid. It was the worst. I remember the first smell i got back was peoples body odor and I was so excited to smell people stink. I cant imagine living like that. Im truly so very sorry for you.", "Oh, for sure, otherwise it wouldn't work as well as it does. \n\nIn this context, I suppose, \"harsh\" means if you had the choice to be exposed to an herbicide or kitchen vinegar, the vinegar is probably the safer option of the two.", "Haha, I had no idea this was a thing!", "It's the best AITA along with AITC (pet version hehe)", "ESH!\n\nNeighbor could have handled you better and requested you to stop. If the party lasted an hour or 2, it wouldn\u2019t kill you. You live part of a society.\n\nIf your neighbor was having a big party, it\u2019s probably a good idea to let neighbors know, so things like parking, noise, etc don\u2019t become a problem.", "NTA\n\ntell him if he wants to control what you do and when on your property you\u2019ll be sending him invoices for your rent/mortgage", "> for an entire weekend\n\nYes this especially. Life even with notice I'm only going to give up X small percentage of my weekend for you lol", "I'm accepting your judgement, but to clarify, their party started on Friday afternoon, they were still going on when I went to bed. Yesterday, they were partying from about 9am-9pm and today it was about 9am-6pm. I didn't hold it against them, it sounded like they hadn't seen their guests for a while. But yeah, to be more specific, this was not a 2-hour shindig.", "Vinegar and grass aren\u2019t even bad smells, lmao. I would way prefer that over breathing in harsh chemical herbicides. The numb lung feeling kinda dampens any party vibe.", "NTA. I love the smell of vinegar. Your neighbors are trippin", "YNTA, you were in your full rights to say and do what you did.\n\nBut personally I think I'd say something like: \"Oh! I'm so sorry, I really didn't mean to stink up your party. Luckily it won't last for long though. Give it a couple of minutes and the smell will be gone, literally by the wind\".\n\nWhy? Because you have to live with your neighbors no matter how dumb they are, and getting into a fight can be so extremely unpleasant that I think twice to make sure it's  worth it before engaging. I'll swallow a lot of camels to keep the peace, even if my blood may boil.  However, I do know where my limits are, believe you me. Make sure you know your limit and where you draw the line, but my advice is to be as lenient as possible within that boundry, also in the way you communicate.", "Who the heck has a birthday party that lasts all weekend?  And why?\n\nOP, you are NTA but your neighbors have too much money if they can afford to feed people for two days just because someone got a year older.", "Same, except it was smoke outside (someone burning stuff) and I was over the moon. It still disappears every time I get a cold (did before) but it tends to be a day or two, and covid took just over a year, I thought it was never coming back.", "Is there something wrong with salad small?\ud83e\udd14\n\n> You knew we have people over.\"\n\nThat's literally a lie tho? He didn't tell you about it, do how could you know? NTA.", "NTA\n\nPeople don't get to control what their neighbors do on their own property unless it is outside the HOA rules or city code. We're having a party all weekend isn't an exception.", "Complaining about smelling .... vinegar?\n\n\nImagine if you'd been digging in manure as fertiliser!\n\n\nEdit: NTA!", "NTA I just sprayed vinegar on my walkways yesterday, and the smell is there for a moment and then dissipates.
