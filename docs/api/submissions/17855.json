No matter what they smell, or how many people say they smell it, you smell no smells.  \n\nThere is no manner of escalation which can prove an odor exists. If they were a serious o-chem wonk they could mass-spec it and tell you the exact aromatic, but they would not be able to prove you wrong if they held this aromatic under your nose and you denied any odor was present because what you experience as smell is more memory than perception. \n\nI lost my sense of smell to a TBI, and I\u2019ve been a spiteful prick about it ever since, because fuck anyone who smells things.", "NTA\n\nBut come on:\n\n> Would they have preferred harsh chemicals blowing into their yard?\n\nChemicals are chemicals, man.
