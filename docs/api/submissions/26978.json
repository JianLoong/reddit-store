{"id": 26978, "submission_id": "16k49ty", "title": "AITA for stopping my dad to get my stepmom a birthday card that had mom on it?", "selftext": "My dad was really late getting my stepmom gifts and cards for her birthday this year. He normally takes me (15m) and my half siblings (4f and 2f) to the store for us to pick these things out but it was a crazy few months for us. When we did go the card selection was not super great in the store and they had no stepmom birthday cards. My dad wanted me to either share the mom card with the girls or get my own mom one for her. I said no way and told him we had to find something else because I was not giving her a card with mom on it. He argued that there were no stepmom cards in the store. I suggested we get one online and see if we can get it the next day or try other stores. Dad tried to get the card despite my protests and I warned him I would not sign it or take part in giving the gifts if the card from me says mom.\n\nThe background is my mom died after giving birth to me and my dad raised me alone for 9 years. He met my stepmom and she's nice. She has tried to be mom and even offered to adopt me but I said no thanks. My dad wanted the adoption to happen and had a bunch of talks with me over why. I said I liked my stepmom (true at the time, didn't love her yet) but I didn't think of her as my mom and didn't think she would ever be, even though yeah I don't remember mom at all. He asked me if I could give it a trial period and I said there are no trial period adoptions. You can't always reverse those. And I know from looking up my states adoption laws and we don't reverse them here unless you were basically adopted illegally. I love my stepmom now but I still wouldn't say she's my mom because even though she still does mom stuff when I think of mom, I think of the woman in the photos and videos I have seen. I might not know her because she died when I was literally just born. But for 15 years she was the only mom I thought about. I still have a good relationship with my stepmom even though it does upset her that I rejected the adoption.\n\nAnyway, the card fight lasted for about an hour of us walking through the store before my dad was like fine, we'll get her a generic card and you can be proud of yourself when her feelings are hurt. Fast forward to the next day and my stepmom's feelings were hurt. I wrote stepmom in the card but it wasn't on the outside. She and my dad talked in private after and she was upset and crying about the card.\n\nAfter that whole moment my dad came and told me I should be ashamed of myself. He said I had hurt her feelings for no good reason and buying the mom card would not have hurt me in any way. But not buying it and handing her a more generic Happy Birthday card broke her heart. I said we could have tried other places and he said I could have let the mom card go this once. I argued that it wouldn't be just this once if I did it one time, because it would still hurt her to go back to stepmom cards every other time I'm sure. He said I was still in the wrong and that he hopes I'm damn proud of myself.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694860834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k49ty/aita_for_stopping_my_dad_to_get_my_stepmom_a/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re happy with how things go. It\u2019s not ok they are trying to manipulate you into giving in and give her what she wants. You deserve to get what you want.

You should be his first priority and your feelings should be the most important to him, not your step mom's.\n\nIt sounds like you handled the situation in a very mature way, and you are absolutely entitled and in the right to refuse to treat your step mom as your mother. It's important to be respectful about this, but your feelings are absolutely valid.", "NTA.  She is your stepmother.  Sit down to discuss this issue first alone with your dad, then bring in stepmother.\n\nExplain that you do love and appreciate her, but that she came into your life at the age of ten, and the term mom was already fixed on your mother. Explain what you like, love, and appreciate about your stepmother. The term stepmother is appropriate because that is the situation. The label stepmother can have bad connotations to some people, but not to you. \n\nTell them that they need to drop the discussion. You do not intend to hurt stepmom, but trying to force the term mom will not be helpful to anyone.\n\nFor you: There may come a time in the future when you do want to call her mom.  Then feel free to do so.  What do you call her now?\n\nAnd for the future, make a card.", "My step mum came into my life when I was around 10, long story but my biological mother was not in my life from age 3. That was her decision. \nI was lucky I had my dad. My older half sisters did not have a father to go to, and ended up homeless.\nIt took me a while to warm up to my step mum, I'm now 28 and only recently started giving her cards that say mum on them. Maybe only a few years ago.\nI remember in my teenage years, correcting people when they called her my mum, saying no, she is my atep mum. No card ever had mum on it, always her name. I was really quite abnoxious about it.\n\nNow I'm older, I regret some of this behaviour. \nThings were complicated in my early life, but all she was trying to do was be there for me and be the mum that I didn't have.\n\nYou're not wrong, she's not your mum.\n But maybe you could think about, how she is just trying to care for you, since your biological mother has passed. She's not trying to replace her, she's just trying to be there for you. What would your life look like without her in it, is it better ? Are you happier with her in your life, rather than without?\n\nNo judgement, seriously.

You got her a nice card!", "You are NTA since your feelings are your feelings.  But do you feel at all like she is your second mom?  Does she listen to you, care for you, go to your sporting/theater/whatever events?  Then she is acting like your mom.\n\nWhen I got married, I used to call my MIL by her name.  Over time, I felt like she was my \"bonus\" mom, she cared for my family (2 kids) and I started calling her Mom.  My mom was still alive, but I cared enough for this woman that I felt like she was an extra mom.  Do you feel at all like that about your stepmom?", "Nta people get to have feelings. Your dad is the problem. He doesn\u2019t get to leave things to the last minute and then make it about you. Try to take on these tasks yourself when you can and don\u2019t reply on your father in case this situation happens again.   I understand your POV about wanting to keep the mom title for the woman who birthed you. It isn\u2019t about your step mom or dad, it\u2019s about your relationship with your mom and wanting to honour her.  \n\nIts important for you to give her the title and unfortunately if you allow your step mom to use it, it might feel like your erasing your mom?", "NTA", "I have 2 children that I birthed along with 3 \"step children.\"  Between them all, they've given me 13 grandchildren all who have known me as Granny since birth.   I typically state to others who ask that I have 5 kids.   However,  I'm a lesbian and when asked while I'm with one of my step children's mother,  it's clear my wife is the one that actually birthed them.   In those circumstances, I revert to calling them my \"bonus child.\"  'Bonus' in my mind means something extra that is considered wanted and special where 'step' to me can be construed as 'go-with'.  Perhaps calling your stepmother your \"Bonus Mom\" is a win-win solution?\n\nEdit:  Regardless,  you are NTA", "Thanks. I hate fighting with my dad.

I wasn't unhappy before my dad got married again. I loved our old life. My dad and I were really close, I had a great extended family and I had great friends and we did cool stuff and nothing was bad about it. The only thing I ever would have changed is I would have loved if mom could have been there. \n\nI still wish my mom was here but I do think my dad's relationship with me has suffered since he remarried which sucks. I can't blame my stepmom for that though because dad wants this thing that I just don't feel or want.", "That being said, my dad is my dad and my siblings are my siblings even if they are \"step\"\n\nBut I've been family with them for 20 years", "I think I met her the day after my 10th birthday.", "The card didn't say stepmom or mom and that hurt her feelings and bothers my dad.
