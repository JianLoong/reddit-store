At first growing up I just thought it was because she's bad with time, but as I've gotten older I genuinely believe she likes making an entrance.\n\nI personally find it 1) rude and 2) embarrassing because it's not like it happens once in a while, it literally happens at every single function she is invited to that has a set time.

(My mom doesn't know that my grandma does this, it's a joke between grandma and I).\n\nThis past weekend was my 22nd birthday. My grandma wanted to do a lunch for me at her place with our immediate family. The lunch was to start at 2pm, but we told my mom 1pm. \n\nI had plans later that evening to go out for dinner with my boyfriend, so I wanted to leave my grandma's house at around 5 the absolute latest because I needed to go home and get all ready. \n\nWell of course my mom was late. We called her at like 2:30PM to see where she was because you know, it's her daughters birthday. She had just left her house at 2:30PM and still had to pick up her bf on her way to my grandma's (30-35 mins away) so none of us were expecting her to arrive until like 3:30PM. \n\nShe finally arrives 2 and a half hours late from the time we told her, makes her little entrance. We question her about. She tells us she thought the lunch started at 2? We asked her where she heard this from, she said my aunt (who was present at the lunch) told her.\n\nWe questioned my aunt and she said she felt bad \"lying to my mom\".\n\nEveryone is pretty annoyed, but we all move on. Fast forward an hour later (4:30PM) I have to start leaving.\n\nMy mom starts getting all annoyed with me that I'm leaving \"so soon\" and that she barely got to see me for my birthday. I told her that my life doesn't revolve around her, and that she should've been there sooner.\n\nShe started giving me attitude and listing all these excuses as to why she's late. I couldn't be bothered to hear them and left. \n\nLater that night she messaged me saying that I was acting like an AH towards her and it was rude of me to lie to her about the time the lunch started. My mom and my aunt think I'm an AH for lying to her. My grandma doesn't think it's a big deal and they're overacting.

So, at the last wedding my Dad and I told my Mum that the venue is an hour away, when it was only about 20 minutes away.

This might be downvoted, but I do think lying to her was kind of an AH move.  She should have been there sooner and not copped an attitude, so yeah, she's an AH too, but you tried to manipulate her to get her to fit into your own timeline.  It seems like you live in a strict sense of scheduling/planning things out, and your mom has an asynchronous way of living her life.  Those often clash.

And then she gets on YOUR case on YOUR birthday for not staying when you had plans? Wow. The audacity.

She will figure it out.", "NTA", "NTA> my sister is exactly like your mom. She tried to tell me it's because she devotes all her time to the one person who is with so that her tardiness is no biggie. But it's a lie. it's all about her and how she has to be the one in control of when things start. You are not wrong for telling her the wrong time. Your Aunt is an AH for not going along. Your mom is the BIGGEST AH for making your birthday about HER.", "NTA, she doesn't respect or think you're important enough to be on time for.  It's crystal clear clear who the AH is in this situation and it's definitely not you.", "She's the AH.  Although, I don't even think I would put in the effort to lie to her, I would just tell her what time things are and just simply don't ever count on her to show up on time.  And then when she tries to talk to you about it, lift your hand up and put it right over her face.", "She is a huge AH! I would flat out tell her... \"Mom.. you NEVER are on time. EVER! It is embarrassing! So... either you can show up when everyone else does, or you can kiss my ass.\"", "NTA. I had 50 years of friends showing up late because they were important and had important crowded schedules. Even better were the gentry who stacked one appointment on top of another, came late, spent time on their phones, and then were off to their next engagement after shouting at me for being distressed that they were late again, hanging on their phones, and off to the next set of names to drop. If they didn\u2019t cancel because schedule and status. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a mother that spoiled. NTA. Of course your mother will make it out to be your fault.", "Like some others here, I have a tendency to be late, so I give myself an extra 15 mins for every commute or stop along the way...& lo & behold, I'm always on time now!", "NTA. There is only one way to deal with people like this. If the fake early start time doesn't work, or stops working because they are told and you figure it out, you simply proceed on the timetable you tell her. Start the meal when you plan to start, finish when you plan to finish and if she misses the meal, simply tell her she knew when it was and its over now. End of story. And don't wait for her beyond a reasonable five or ten minutes if you are going somewhere supposedly together. Just leave and let her catch a taxi if she hasn't already missed the event.", "NTA.  Your mom is.  It\u2019s not that hard to be on time almost always and instead of fighting with her you told her a little white lie to ease the issue.  I know people who are like that and have done the same thing.  She needs to learn to be co side rate of others.", "NTA. Your mom is an AH for never respecting everyone\u2019s time and effort. Aunt is too for being complicit.", "NTA but next time just tell her the real.time and leave when you need to. This Nisha her issue not a you issue. Happy Birthday", "NTA. Natural consequences.", "NTA my mom is also always late for everything. The difference is she ASKS us to tell her the wrong time, so she can get there on time.", "You know what's rude?  Being perpetually late, to all events.\n\nYou know what's rude?  Expecting everyone's lives and time to revolve around you.\n\nNTA.  And next time, I might \"forget\" to invite someone who acted this way.", "NTA- your mom doesn't give a crap about anybodies time but hers. Stop accommodating her- stop giving her attention for her entrances- stop inviting her to anything time sensitive. If she wanted more time with you, she should have some basic consideration and show up on time.", "NTA.", "Nta. But I would do like other have said and quit lying to her.  If someone says the even starts at 2 then start at 2.  She can start missing things since she can\u2019t show up on time", "NTA!!!! I always tell my mom half hour earlier for anything. It's no big deal, as long as you don't lie about everything. The few times my mom was actually early because of the time I said, and I confessed; she would get mad at me for about a minute, then laughs at it. Your mom's is the AH for her lack of caring, commitment and gaslight.", "NTA. It seems like she has no respect for anyones time and it does kind of sound like she just expects everyone to wait for her and accommodate her time. You telling her an earlier time, is honestly a good move. Considering her history, you just want to try to help her be on time to functions she\u2019s invited to. But at the same time, even if you told her earlier times, she\u2019s not going to change or think there is anything wrong with what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s one thing to be late every now and then bc shit happens. But to be consistently late. And she not leaving her place until 2:30, and acknowledging the event started at 2:00, shows she\u2019s not very considerate.", "Reminds me of last year during Easter. We had to wait for one of the kids to wake up from their nap to do the Easter egg hunt. She took a 2 hr nap. We just left i wasn\u2019t waiting for that. My kid was a baby so it didn\u2019t matter to us if he did the hunt.", "When I was in college, I had one class that started at 8am, and the doors closed at 8.  If the doors were closed, you weren\u2019t allowed to come in.  \n\nYou need to close your doors.", "NTA\n\nMy family did this to my mum. I have to say it has gotten better and she knows about it. I also have anxiety about being late because of that feeling of everyone looking at you because you are late. \n\nTell grandma to set times, and if she doesn't show up on time, don't wait for her to eat. She may eventually get the gist.", "NTA my mum is chronically late. She made me miss my leavers concert because she wanted to curl her hair at the time it started. She would leave me at school on half days for hours because she couldn\u2019t collect me on time. She has wasted hours of my life waiting for her to arrive when she was supposed to.\nAgain it\u2019s like a family joke, but it gives me so much anxiety and it embarrasses me loads in front of my partner and his family. I couldn\u2019t enjoy my graduation day because I was anxious and paranoid about her lateness ruining it. I don\u2019t trust or rely on her at all to ever physically be there for me, that makes me feel really sad when I see others being able to rely on their parents. I forget a lot and then kick myself when she lets me down again, but I never seem to learn!", "Nta. U made sure she would be on time.  However, I'm not sure you want to continue getting together with her if she's gonna keep being late to everything", "NTA. Your mom totally is TA, and I don't know what the deal is with your aunt, maybe she's enabling your mom. Whatever. You sound like a solid, rational person.", "NTA - its arrogance .  Plan arrogance , that everybody will revolve around them\n\nThey don't explain aircraft or other schedules to wait but people they know are expected to care.\n\nYour mother is the AH.  If she wanted to spend time with you she would have made the effort.  That morning and afternoon, she had other priorities and chose to be late.", "I'm with Grandma on this one.", "NTA You should point out to your aunt that your mom knew that party was at 2 and still didn't show up until 3:30. That, it was precisely why you gave your mom the earlier time so she's the AH for making your mom later to the party. To your mom, well others have much better suggestions.\n\nFor my family we have some people that we give earlier times for family gatherings for this exact reason. If we were meeting for a family dinner, we wouldn't wait past the real time to start eating.", "Every time you accomodate her, by delaying your event, gives her the affirmation that what she is doing is ok. So she continues. Next time, just start without her. Hopefully, she gets the message. If not, no loss either", "This is the best answer OP. My aunt used to be your mom, always late. The family drew the line when she was three hours late to Thanksgiving and we had a house full of hungry kids (my dad is one of ten kids, all with a few kids of their own). Once she realized her tardiness wasn't going to be tolerated, miracle of miracles she was able to make it to events on time!", "This. Or stop inviting her to these things entirely. And if she gets upset, then be honest about that too. \"Sorry, it's just that everyone is sick and tired of you always being late to everything on purpose, so we've just decided to not bother inviting you from now on.\"", "Absolutely this. If its a dinner starting at 12, start your dinner. If she arrives just as they're clearing the plates and everyone's leaving that's on her. She's a grown up. If she can't get herself there on time she misses out. Her and your aunt sound like spoiled brats.", "And don't give her attention when she arrives. Stop that immediately. When she gets there give an, \"ah, you're here.\" Then go back to the event and don't give her that satisfaction of \"omggg I'm here so sorry I'm late love love smooches smooches the traffic was so bad omg how are you ahahahaha\".\n\nWhen she comes barging in late, make a simple acknowledgment that she's there and then pretend like there's been no interruption. If she starts trying to make her scene a simple, \"you're on time for your reputation, nothing unexpected. If you need to collect yourself, go ahead and do so. We'll be here when you're ready to join us.\"", "Exactly.  If you have plans with your mom for lunch at 2, at 2 order your lunch.  When you're finished, leave.  If everyone does this she might get the picture.  If not, you've had a nice, quiet lunch. She's not worth the drama.", "100%. Literally don\u2019t even acknowledge her when she shows up late. If she\u2019s walking into a hostile room, hopefully the excitement of making an entrance will start to fade.", "Best reply there could be!", "NTA.\n\nThis but also make a huge point of acknowledging her \u201centrance\u201d. Have everyone applaud when she walks in, ect.", "But what I don't get is, if she knew the food would be ready at 2pm, lunch starts at 2pm. Then why did she show up to eat at 4pm?", "Or just stop inviting her at all. You know she\u2019s going to try to steal the limelight by walking in late, and if you don\u2019t wait for her she\u2019s going to cause a scene over that instead. OP is NTA, but mom is, and so is the aunt for enabling her.", "This definitely, she might take the hint then that no one will wait around for her in future", "BTW - You can reverse this as well.  When she plans an event, everyone should show up an hour late.  See how fast she is typing those text messages and burning up the phone lines to find out where everyone is.", "This right here. Let her experience the natural consequences of her behavior. And don\u2019t play into the making an entrance thing. If she shows up late, say hello and go right back to whatever you were doing. Give her as little attention as possible for the behavior.", "This. Do not lie to her.  and NTA\n\nInstead of lying, might I suggest that you give a start and end time to certain activities where it makes sense to do so.  That way she cannot give you grief if you leave at the time you said that you will. Make another commitment following the event if that will help solidify your resolve.", "My mil did this.  I just started making she understood what time we were sitting down to eat and we stuck to it. Didn't change her behavior but we no longer cared.", "Succinctly put. \n\nNTA. Quit waiting around, enjoy life, and she will either figure it out or pout. Her choice.", "Yes! This 100%! Start meals on time and end on time. When she shows up no one acknowledge her entrance or give her the attention she wants. The same with your aunt. Now you know you can\u2019t trust her either.", "Wish we would have thought of this game when my asshole uncle was 4 hours late to Thanksgiving.", "LOL - used to do that too. Once sib was \\~45 minutes late we would first make bets on where they were, then call to find out.\n\nHad another chronically late sib so we once set up a run down card table with a little chair away from everyone else. That was fun too. (he didn't actually have to sit there but we were able to laugh at his expense)", "Love this!!", "This is the way!!! I love it and will steal this for sure.", "You guys are geniuses!", "This is a grown ass woman that raised a child. She is perfectly capable of being on time, but repeatedly chooses not to. She thinks her time matters, but no one else's does. That level of blatant disrespect and selfishness is embarrassing. No more lying about times, starting activities late, prolonging activities, or having any arguments about it. She's wasted more than enough of your life. NTA.", "Not only that, but the lie needs to go from being 1 hour early to 1.5 hours early. Aunt can just sit around and wait for a while. They can pass the time by making bets on if Mom will be on-time or not, ha.\n\nAlthough the more reasonable people in this thread have pointed out the real solution of just not accommodating late people. 5 - 15 minutes late is just traffic, but 90 minutes means she doesn't care.", "I'm pretty sure my kids do this to me (I overschedule myself all the time - ADHD, but not THAT late). I try and make their fake start times and usually make it in time for the real ones. I certainly don't blame them for not trusting me with the real time.", "This is the way. I had a friend who would pull this shit so I just acted like I didn\u2019t notice. Didn\u2019t make any calls or send texts. Didn\u2019t ask about it. Didn\u2019t delay my plans. It wasn\u2019t long before he started showing up on time.  For some people, the attention is the fun part.", "You were right to leave and enjoy the rest of your evening. Fuck waiting for your selfish mom.", "[removed]", "Or a dinner cruise. Just don\u2019t mention the cruise part.", "Damn the torpedoes, Tom Petty has arrived! Love this.", "Not only affirmation, she gets all the attention too.  This is a win win for her.", "THIS!! I came here to say this!", "I agree with this. It\u2019s exhausting to put this much thought and effort into dealing with someone who does whatever they want no matter how it impacts others. This is a sensible approach.", "3 hours? your family has way more restraint than most mortals. she'd have been lucky if there was any pie left if she showed up at my house 3 hours late.", "Because it's a control issue.  She gets to control the whole event and make it all about her.\n\nLike everyone said.  If lunch is a 2.  Sit down, eat at 2.  Don't call her to find out when she will arrive,  just sit and eat, then, when everyone is done clean up, and put everything away, or if you are out, pay the check and leave.\n\nDon't save anything for her.\n\nJust move on with whatever.  Once she realizes no one is going to cater to her she'll stop.\n\nChronically late people are some of the rudest mfkrs.", "ill be looking for the next \u201cAITA that i started a gambling ring over my Uncles tardiness to publicly shame him to show up on time?\u201d post. i know already how everyone will vote.", "100% agreement.  I just thought it was pretty low of the aunt to actively sabotage the efforts to counteract the mom's horrible behavior.", "I have ADHD and leave early and plan my day around being on time because I\u2019m notoriously never on time. Lateness happens but This does not seem like a \u201coh shit I took way longer in the shower because of a time warp again\u201d or even the executive dysfunction of not being able to start getting ready. We also tend to feel super guilty about it because we know it\u2019s happening and we\u2019ve managed to fuck it up again. ADHD a might be the reason but the frequency here doesn\u2019t make it an excuse, and also seems less about neurodivergence and more about Mom being the main character. Two wildly different things. \n\nthis was a blatant disregard for OP\u2019s birthday and had the audacity to guilt them for having to leave on time. She showed up an hour and a half late for the party. Instead of saying \u201csorry I was late again and didn\u2019t get to spend enough time with you\u201d it was OP\u2019s fault for leaving.", "People who are neurodivergent are generally embarrassed by their lateness and genuinely try to be on time. Op's mom would be apologetic if she actually gave a damn", "I had the same thought.", "Haaaaaaaaa you right \ud83e\udd23", "I love this one.  Wave at her when you come back to the dock.", "Brilliant. Boat will be out in the harbor when mom arrives.", "I love this so much.", "Dinner cruise!! OMG that's awesome. I had a mom like this. I wish I had thought about dinner cruise.", "They should\u2019ve shown up if they didn\u2019t want to be lied to.", "It wasn\u2019t long before he started showing up on time. For some people, the attention is the fun part."]}
