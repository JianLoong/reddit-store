I'm talking family gettogethers, birthdays, graduations, wedding's, you name it she's showing up late. At first growing up I just thought it was because she's bad with time, but as I've gotten older I genuinely believe she likes making an entrance.\n\nI personally find it 1) rude and 2) embarrassing because it's not like it happens once in a while, it literally happens at every single function she is invited to that has a set time.

(My mom doesn't know that my grandma does this, it's a joke between grandma and I).\n\nThis past weekend was my 22nd birthday. My grandma wanted to do a lunch for me at her place with our immediate family. The lunch was to start at 2pm, but we told my mom 1pm. \n\nI had plans later that evening to go out for dinner with my boyfriend, so I wanted to leave my grandma's house at around 5 the absolute latest because I needed to go home and get all ready. \n\nWell of course my mom was late. We called her at like 2:30PM to see where she was because you know, it's her daughters birthday. She had just left her house at 2:30PM and still had to pick up her bf on her way to my grandma's (30-35 mins away) so none of us were expecting her to arrive until like 3:30PM. \n\nShe finally arrives 2 and a half hours late from the time we told her, makes her little entrance. We question her about. She tells us she thought the lunch started at 2? We asked her where she heard this from, she said my aunt (who was present at the lunch) told her.\n\nWe questioned my aunt and she said she felt bad \"lying to my mom\".\n\nEveryone is pretty annoyed, but we all move on. Fast forward an hour later (4:30PM) I have to start leaving.\n\nMy mom starts getting all annoyed with me that I'm leaving \"so soon\" and that she barely got to see me for my birthday. I told her that my life doesn't revolve around her, and that she should've been there sooner.\n\nShe started giving me attitude and listing all these excuses as to why she's late. I couldn't be bothered to hear them and left. \n\nLater that night she messaged me saying that I was acting like an AH towards her and it was rude of me to lie to her about the time the lunch started. My mom and my aunt think I'm an AH for lying to her. My grandma doesn't think it's a big deal and they're overacting.

She is being extremely self-centered and disrespectful to everyone. You all should just proceed with your plans whether she is there or not.

I know it may seem extreme but I'd go no contact with her.", "NTA - your mom shouldn't be a consideration in any plans you make, because she's proven herself completely unreliable.  You shouldn't take any ounce of her complaining that she didn't get to see you on your bday - everyone else did, because they showed up on time.\n\nBut low key your Aunty is an AH for ruining how you and your Grandma operated!", "NTA - I got so sick of my Mum being late for weddings, we have a large extended family so there are usually a few weddings a year. She would take ages to even start getting ready then would become really stressed as everyone else would be downstairs or in the car waiting for her. So, at the last wedding my Dad and I told my Mum that the venue is an hour away, when it was only about 20 minutes away. We arrived early enough to get to the venue, take some family pictures and get seated. My Mum was initially very annoyed that we lied to her, until a load of relatives thanked and complimented us for being there on time as they didn't have to wait for people to arrive in order to start the main events.

This might be downvoted, but I do think lying to her was kind of an AH move.  She should have been there sooner and not copped an attitude, so yeah, she's an AH too, but you tried to manipulate her to get her to fit into your own timeline.  It seems like you live in a strict sense of scheduling/planning things out, and your mom has an asynchronous way of living her life.  Those often clash.

Your aunt that had a crisis of conscience is an AH because she obviously doesn't understand and perpetuated this drama between you and your mom. Your mom is an AH for 1) expecting you to stick around when you already had plans 2) for being upset at you when really it was her own lateness that caused her to have a limited time with you on your birthday.\n\nOP, here's what I have found to work: let your mom be late to everything.

And then she gets on YOUR case on YOUR birthday for not staying when you had plans? Wow. The audacity.
