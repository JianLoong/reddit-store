At first growing up I just thought it was because she's bad with time, but as I've gotten older I genuinely believe she likes making an entrance.\n\nI personally find it 1) rude and 2) embarrassing because it's not like it happens once in a while, it literally happens at every single function she is invited to that has a set time.

(My mom doesn't know that my grandma does this, it's a joke between grandma and I).\n\nThis past weekend was my 22nd birthday. My grandma wanted to do a lunch for me at her place with our immediate family. The lunch was to start at 2pm, but we told my mom 1pm. \n\nI had plans later that evening to go out for dinner with my boyfriend, so I wanted to leave my grandma's house at around 5 the absolute latest because I needed to go home and get all ready. \n\nWell of course my mom was late. We called her at like 2:30PM to see where she was because you know, it's her daughters birthday. She had just left her house at 2:30PM and still had to pick up her bf on her way to my grandma's (30-35 mins away) so none of us were expecting her to arrive until like 3:30PM. \n\nShe finally arrives 2 and a half hours late from the time we told her, makes her little entrance. We question her about. She tells us she thought the lunch started at 2? We asked her where she heard this from, she said my aunt (who was present at the lunch) told her.\n\nWe questioned my aunt and she said she felt bad \"lying to my mom\".\n\nEveryone is pretty annoyed, but we all move on. Fast forward an hour later (4:30PM) I have to start leaving.\n\nMy mom starts getting all annoyed with me that I'm leaving \"so soon\" and that she barely got to see me for my birthday. I told her that my life doesn't revolve around her, and that she should've been there sooner.\n\nShe started giving me attitude and listing all these excuses as to why she's late. I couldn't be bothered to hear them and left. \n\nLater that night she messaged me saying that I was acting like an AH towards her and it was rude of me to lie to her about the time the lunch started. My mom and my aunt think I'm an AH for lying to her. My grandma doesn't think it's a big deal and they're overacting.

So, at the last wedding my Dad and I told my Mum that the venue is an hour away, when it was only about 20 minutes away.

This might be downvoted, but I do think lying to her was kind of an AH move.  She should have been there sooner and not copped an attitude, so yeah, she's an AH too, but you tried to manipulate her to get her to fit into your own timeline.  It seems like you live in a strict sense of scheduling/planning things out, and your mom has an asynchronous way of living her life.  Those often clash.

And then she gets on YOUR case on YOUR birthday for not staying when you had plans? Wow. The audacity.

You might get some interesting stories out of it.  \n\nIf it's important to you that she shows up, give her the different start time.  If she starts showing up on time once in a while, you can reconsider then. \n\nNowadays, I tell everyone the same start time, but I include an end time too.  \"3-6PM\" or similar.  I'm leaving or I'm asking people to leave at or near the end time.", "Might also be worth considering if the attention starts before her arrival. Like does she get a bunch of calls/texts asking where she is or getting updated ETAs. If she's late to something like a dinner reservation does everyone put effort into helping her find the right table or whatever.", "Do they *like* the rest of your family? Because I would show up 4.5 hours late to an event that I wanted to spend 4.5 fewer hours at.", ">the lie needs to go from being 1 hour early to 1.5 hours early\n\nNah, make it a random thing. Sometimes give the correct start time, sometimes 20 minutes early, sometimes 53 minutes early...she'll never be able to guess and she'll go crazy trying to figure it out haha", "I have ADHD and it makes deadlines very hard to manage. I still manage to be on time to classes and work, and I assume most chronically late people can at the very least make it to work on time. If you are chronically late, then take the responsibility upon yourself to lie to yourself and say you need to be there a half hour or hour earlier than it starts. I do that and I set reminders to make sure I\u2019m not late because I\u2019m not interested in disrespecting peoples\u2019 time. It\u2019s completely disrespectful to be an hour late and to expect everyone to delay their day for you. I get having issues with time management, but if it\u2019s that impossible for you to fix it, then be friends with people who are also late all the time.", "It can also get in the way of plans, so stop inviting her at all. If you have a dinner reservation, for example, some places will refuse to seat a group of six if only five are present.", "They claim to \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f tbh I\u2019m not particularly fond of them though.", "Yes!! Don\u2019t give her more attention - that\u2019s why she does it. Don\u2019t hold lunch or dinner or whatever for her. If she can\u2019t be on time, she\u2019ll lose out. The world does NOT revolve around her and it\u2019s time she learns that. She\u2019ll probably sulk to get more attention; just ignore her and live your life. Maybe she\u2019ll learn, maybe she won\u2019t. NTA", "And quit calling and asking where she is\u2014no more attention!", "> She likes the attention.   \n\nIt probably  also makes her feel important when they wait for her.  \n\nOP is NTA", "My grandmother, to this day, tells you a time. That\u2019s when food hits the table, she\u2019ll keep anything that\u2019s left warm or store it for reheating until everyone shows up\u2026but ain\u2019t nobody waiting for you to eat their dinner.  You get what\u2019s left.", "Wow... old dog learning new tricks.", "Aunt sounds like someone who will ask her why she's late and sit with her while she eats.", "We did this with one of our cousins. Always turns up late and makes an entrance. \n\nAt one family gathering, she swept in, an hour late, making sure all eyes were on her and her kids when ... \n\nMy brother jumped up out of his chair and yelled, \"I won!!!\", then did a \"victory lap\" of the table.", "My Mom is late to stuff all the time. Like, if you tell her \"This event starts at seven.\" she thinks that means she can get ready to leave the house at seven fifteen and still make it. Dude. No.\n\nAt the same time, she hates when other people are late, or make her wait. I dead ass laughed in her face several times. \"You think we like waiting for hours for you to get your ass in gear? That frustration is what we've been feeling for years! Sucks, doesn't it?\"", "Affirmation that SHE is the most important person there because everything revolved around her whim. Totally a power trip.", "Uh... What...the...fuuuuuh?", "It works doubly better if you force pull the blaster out of their hand too.", "I love the level of pettiness", "Excuses? Where did I make excuses? I never gave one excuse for my lateness. I never explained my reasoning for it so how could I keep making excuses? All I said is that I'm chronically late and I accept the consequences. What excuse did I make for it?", "Which is people pleasers wonder why people don\u2019t like them. Unless they are very careful they end up a flying monkey.", "I appreciate the advice but I accept the consequences of my lateness. Trying to correct it caused more issues than just being late. The people in my life can accept it or not, but it's not realistic to pre-screen friends for lateness. Just be honest about being late all the time and people can make their own decisions. If they don't find value in having you in their life, then that's fine. That's a consequence and they can go their own way. If they find value in having you in their life, then they make it work. I'm not a disrespectful person and it's overly simplistic to say a person who is late all the time is inherently disrespectful. Most chronically late people I've ever known were not intentionally disrespectful people.", "Check the definition of \"consequences.\" They are actually consequences, regardless of whether or not the late person is okay with them. \n\nOP will face consequences for either lying to mom about the time or telling the truth about the time. The consequence of lying about the time is mom shows up on time (unless someone blows it, like we see here). The consequence of telling mom the truth is mom misses the event. The consequence of mom finding out OP is lying about the time is possibly being called an AH.", "That's hugely different than chronically late. Chronically late is that no matter what you are late to a point where it is like a personality trait. You're just in a position where time doesn't match up great because being an adult sucks like that. As long as everybody is aware that's very different. Like the other person said, I would say you have scheduling conflicts rather than are chronically late", "You're right. You didn't. You're defending yourself against someone who doesn't know the definition of \"consequences\" and someone who doesn't know what an excuse is. I wouldn't think that's worth my time, myself \u2764\ufe0f", "Research? How about seeking a medical diagnosis?"]}
