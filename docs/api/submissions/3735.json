Are fines a way to punish poor people especially? Yes. Is that your fault? No.", "NTA - call your adjuster and let them know about the communication. Do not take any calls from them. Your insurance company has lawyers that can deal with this.", "NTA. I used to work in auto insurance (service, sales, claims, underwriting, basically everything). You absolutely did the right thing. While it\u2019s true they wouldn\u2019t have been caught had you not caused the accident, they also wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if they didn\u2019t do something illegal. Turn the argument around, \u201cIf you had not driven illegally, this accident never would have happened so you should pay for the accident I caused\u201d and you can see how absurd their argument is. \n\nOne of my more ridiculous stories from my insurance jobs was a driver who was driving drunk.

He wanted us to pay for his DUI fees and fines because he never would have been caught if our driver didn\u2019t hit him! He apparently tried to argue with the judge for the charges to be dismissed based on this logic. Simply incredible.", "NTA, because you *are* paying for the accident you caused, just through your insurance. \n\nAnd although I wouldn't be surprised if his own insurance declines to pay him due to his violation of their policies, I *would* be quite surprised if *your* insurance doesn't have to shell out money to him substantially equivalent to the damage you caused.

That is on them.", "NTA. If they were following the law, insurance would have handled it. This is exactly why you don't let someone without a license drive your car.\n\nHe knew what he was doing.

It is then up to your insurance to take care of it (the purpose of insurance). You are not responsible for their poor choices resulting in a claim denial along with the other fines. If they didn't want to have any problems while they are low income, they should have played it safe and not behaved as they did. If they actually tried to look around, they would likely have found some way of getting help running errands and the like.  At this point, since the husband called you and got angry with you, you should probably report to your insurance company that the husband made contact and was aggressive with you. Even if their own lawyers can't help you with this, they can likely point you in the right direction. Also, do not help them with rent or food. I get that you feel guilty overall, but all that they are doing is manipulating you. Your only knowledge that they are low income is because THEY said so. That may not actually be true. Either way, providing them any assistance just opens the door for them to abuse your kindness (and finances) at any point in time even long after you have paid off the costs of the damage to the vehicle (which is ALL you should be responsible for). Again, if they did not want to pay fines and get into trouble (they've probably lost their own insurance now and no-one else will want to pick them up given the reason for the loss), they should not have played the dangerous gamble that they did. Those problems are entirely on them and the only reason that the accident with you is involved is because that is what go them caught. If the accident hadn't happened, the lady may have been pulled over a mile further up the road for something else. They would have been found out then with the same consequences save for fixing the vehicle. Or perhaps they would never have been caught. We can never know, but since it sounds like there are hefty fines involved they reasonable thing would have been never to have chanced it to begin with.", "NTA\nYou are not refusing to pay. You called the police, you committed the accident so that the insurance will pay for it. It is not your fault, that she was driving without a licence. It was a big risk from their side to do this.", "Just to be clear, what you are suggesting is that if someone chooses to break the law and drive illegally, then other people on the road should expect to not be covered by their own insurance.

Drivers run the risk of an insurance claim **every time they drive a car**. They gambled, they lost.\n\nLastly, what they are asking is excessive.

I called the police about 15 years ago when someone raked the side of my parked car (that I happened to still be sitting in) while pulling into the parking space next to me with more than enough room on either side to avoid coming within a foot of my car. Left a two-plus-foot gash on the side of my car. The driver and his passengers were really annoyed that I would call the police about something so \"minor.\" They were quite dramatic about it. The police took their sweet time showing up, so I reluctantly ended up exchanging info with them instead. Surprise, surprise, it turned out they had no insurance, which was why they were so against my calling the police. I'm sure they would've just hightailed it outta there if I hadn't been right there to confront them. And then a few years later some guy smashed into the back of my car at a red light, we were both stopped, and then, for some reason, he decided to accelerate even though the light hadn't changed. He begged me to let him pay for the repairs out of pocket instead of going through insurance. I didn't agree to that. It turns out he had an awful driving record and couldn't \"afford\" to have another accident against his insurance. My point being that it's a total red flag when drivers are soooo hesitant about calling the police and/or exchanging insurance info.

Of course you need to make sure you get a copy of the paper from the courthouse listing her fines & repair estimates from no less than 3 licensed repair shops for the damages. Do this before handing over any money.

Frankly the couple should call a lawyer who does car accident cases, they usually work on contingency and can actually help them fight your insurance Co.", "Preferring to go through insurance rather than pay out of pocket doesn't make you an asshole. You owned up to the damage you caused, everything else that has happened is karma, not you.  \n\nNTA", "ESH!\n\nEdit, ESH not EBSH.\n\nEdit 2, Somewhat drunk!", "Not to mention he's done the future owners of both cars a favour as it'll show on car checks.\n\nI used to work in car complaints myself and it was a headache when down the line a mechanic points out previous repairs the dealer could not have known about without stripping the thing.", "Wouldn't OP be in trouble too if complications pop up and he didn't make the police report?", "I do feel bad :/ she looked like she was driving back from a food bank, and she spoke very little English. I'm not exactly well off either though >.>", "Yeah, I agree with this. Situations like this are rarely so black and white as N T A, Y T A, etc. It really should not be OPs fight, both insurance companies will try and keep their money at all costs while OP feels responsible. What a shitty situation.", "Technically that does work, although it\u2019s fucked up.\n\nAll they need to do is run. Then your company won\u2019t honor your uninsured motorist coverage. And nothing happens to them of course because they ran.\n\nOr at least that\u2019s how it was for me.", "Police asked for it to put on the driver exchange form", "Standard part of having an accident, you exchange contact info", "There would still have been an accident.", "Incorrect. OP was operating a vehicle legally and insurance would have covered accident if other party had not broken the law.", "I mean, I think that filing an accident report and giving them my insurance info is also considered taking responsibility? Like, my premium will definitely go up, and I had to buy a shitty overpriced used car to make up for the total loss. How is that just words? I'm hesitant to offer them money out of pocket because that's what insurance is for, and my insurance company and a lawyer friend advised me against it because they could try to scam me or something.", "So how do you take responsibility for a car accident besides filing a report and going through insurance?", "That\u2019s not true at all. OP is taking full responsibility for the accident. They are doing everything that they are supposed to do. It is not OPs fault that the other party was breaking the law and is now suffering consequences for that. OP did everything exactly correctly.", "I think the ask is steep. The truck seemingly has mostly cosmetic issues and they are asking him to foot the bill for court fees to sue the insurance company which will go absolutely nowhere as they breached understandable T&Cs.\n\nIn my country the defendant can claim court costs when they win, an insurance company won't have cheap lawyers so OP would be throwing thousands down the drain, likely more than the repairs would cost.\n\nIf they had asked for a contribution to repairs at a reasonable garage, I'd be thinking N A H over the request.", "I'd disagree as if he had hit someone with a valid licence the insurance would have paid out. Its not his fault they breached their T&Cs. \n\nHe's admitted it to the insurance company and will likely pay higher premiums in future, and that's all that should be expected. \n\nPolicies are there for a reason and he shouldn't be liable for costs because the reason they can't claim is their own problem.", "Then they should do that.\n\nNo, it's not OP's problem that they broke the law in a way that cancels out their protections. Her crime is unwittingly and unintentionally exposing them for breaking the law -- they're not entitled to compensation for that.", "That's not how insurance works.\n\nYes, the other party *could* successfully sue OP in court but then OP's insurance would cover any damages (less deductible). Moreover, the other party would have to foot a hefty legal bill until they secure a successful judgment, which is not guaranteed.\n\nNTA", "I was kind of wondering if they would take me to court over this actually. Tbh I doubt they will, as I was told by my insurance and a lawyer friend that they likely don't have much of a case. It would probably be an expensive process for them, and they would probably lose. I'm not saying this is right. But it's the system we live in. I'm just not sure if that makes me the asshole", "\u2026He had insurance. The other person didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t have a license, and had 3 kids in the car. At a minimum it\u2019s ESH. \n\nLet them talk through lawyers. Husband should not have called OP. He also shouldn\u2019t have allowed his wife to put his kids in danger. \n\nIf they want to go the route of suing him for damages, they certainly can and have that right. But I doubt they get anywhere because the person he hit shouldn\u2019t have been on the road. OP has been above board on everything after the accident. He shouldn\u2019t do a single thing outside insurance/court and to suggest he do otherwise is ridiculous.", "So to clarify, they were trying to go through my insurance, but my insurance is refusing to cover it due to the woman driving without a license, and the person holding the insurance knowingly giving permission for an unlicensed person to operate his vehicle. Their insurance is refusing to pay them because I was the one at fault. I would be open to helping pay for some of the damage out of pocket, but my insurance advised me not to because it would give them more ammunition to either sue me or try to scam me. \n\nI'm thinking on this more though, and instead of paying for car problems, maybe I can assist with food or rent or something else, up to some amount so I'm not technically paying for their car damages but they get something out of it. I did take financial responsibility in that my premium is probably going to skyrocket and I had to buy a new car that I can barely afford. It's just that my financial responsibility ended up not covering them", "Why should he have to pay out of pocket when he has insurance? The adjusters need to handle it, he's taken responsibility and accepted liability. It needs to play out through insurance. If a claim is denied because she didn't have a license, well...play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", ">Finally, you for not being willing to pay anything towards offsetting the costs incurred by an accident that you openly admit was your fault.\n\nOP did that when they paid their insurance premiums. That's how insurance works. OP should not incur further liability or responsibility just because the person whom they accidentally hit was breaking the law.", "If he agrees to pay anything, it can have legal consequences. Even just agreeing to chip in $50 can be accepting legal responsibility, which strengthens their case if they then decide to sue for more.\n\nOP be very careful about agreeing to pay anything because if they sue that is an admission that you are liable. That is why businesses make you sign a settlement and release agreement before they give a concession. It always states that the payment is not an admission of responsibility and cannot be used as one in court. Without that, it opens the door to lawsuits.", "Why should he have to pay *any* of the fines they have received for driving without a licence? That is 100% on them.\n\nI understand the argument some have about him contributing to the repairs (while I don't agree with it) but the fines? Definitely not.", "So what was the proper course of action? Not filing a police report and not notifying insurance? Do none of the stuff you're supposed to do after an accident?", "You know in most places it\u2019s a crime to not report an accident of this magnitude, right?", "Sorry, do you mean esh?", "Depends on the area. Some places require a police report, my area does self reporting. If any vehicle has damage totalling greater than $2500, you're required to submit an accident report to the DMV, but you are not required to have police respond, and actually unless it presents a traffic hazard police are unlikely to respond.\n\nRegardless, you ALWAYS have rights during a claim, and an insurance company is required by law to deal with you honestly, so if I have to choose between dealing directly with an adjuster or a claimant, I'm going to work with the adjuster every time.", "What's OP supposed to do now anyway?  The police report exists and the relevant fact that the wife was driving without a license isn't something OP can challenge.\n\nI don't know what this guy thinks OP can do to help.", "You don't make the laws. If you'd done anything that looked like you were trying to cover it up, you could have gotten in more trouble later.", "Well that depends on how we interpret \u201cnot illegally driving.\u201d If we take it to mean, had the wife been driving legally, then sure, accident would have still happened. But if it means \u201cnot driving at all because driving without a license is illegal\u201d then the wife wouldn\u2019t have been on the road and no accident would have occurred.", "But insurance would have paid out and he wouldn't be dealing with this issue of costs now.\n\nHe'd have higher premiums in future, as is right and he will anyway, but none of this. *This* particular situation is the risk they took every time he let her drive the car.", "No, there would not have been.  At least, not with the truck, because if she wasn\u2019t illegally driving that truck it would not have been there to crash into.", "While, yes, you did cause the accident you are also taking responsibility for it.  They broke the law and they are seemingly not taking responsiblity for that. Listen to the lawyer and your insurance.", "Sort of, but you should recognize that you are directly benefiting from a rigged system in this country that criminalizes poverty. \n\nYou're comfortable calling insurance & washing your hands of it because the system works for you. You can afford insurance & the only really negative outcome here for you is that you have to buy a new car & pay higher premiums (which, frankly, you should be paying higher premiums - you caused a damn accident - you're lucky she was in a truck, you could have seriously maimed her children for life if she'd been in a car like yours.) \n\nMeanwhile, his family is stuck in our f'd up court system that will undoubtedly cause them thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours. For them, the consequences range from at least as much money out of pocket as you are paying (for an accident that you caused) that they can't afford as readily as you can. \n\nFor them, the time & money involved in dealing with the fallout from your decision to use insurance because it is easier for you could cost one or both parents their job and their housing, and being homeless with kids is a good way to get your children taken away from you and put into the foster care system.\n\nI'm not saying that's inevitable - but your driving put that possibility on the table for them. So, are you coming on here to ask for a pass because you followed the rules? \n\nShould his wife have had a license? Yes. But there's a lot of pretty harmless reasons why she might not have. The human thing to do would have been to deal with it person-to-person when she asked you to go that route and not get your insurance companies and the police involved.", "I was focusing more on the truck\u2026and thinking about those repairs and if there was a way to cover some of that. \nTickets and fines are on them and should be.", "They\u2019re entitled to compensation for the property destruction that OP admitted to.", "They don\u2019t have a leg to stand on even if they did try to sue- no lawyer will take the case because the driver was unlicensed. They created the problem and are stuck with consequences.", "It doesn't. Doing things by the book doesn't make you an AH.\n\nKeep telling yourself if you had hit a car whose driver was following the law, you would not be dealing with all of this now.\n\nThey run the risk of something like this each time they set out, like every driver does. They should have protected themselves instead of trying to get the other party to mitigate the costs of their mistake.", "This is a slippery slope. While I appreciate your compassion, any private action could prove problematic. \n\nDefinitely NTA", "A lawyer would see through that in a heartbeat. You're not obligated to pay out of pocket when you hit someone breaking the law, and you definitely shouldn't be expected to morally.", "That\u2019s not taking responsibility, that\u2019s suffering the consequences of your own actions.", "No, and when did I say that is what they should have done?\n\nYou should absolutely do those things.  But now, OP and the insurance companies are using technicalities to avoid paying for the accident.  \n\nOP should absolutely help this family, it\u2019s OPs fault.  And as someone who works with families in poverty, something like this could seriously hold back and hurt a family for a long time.."]}
