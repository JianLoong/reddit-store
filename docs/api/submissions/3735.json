Your insurance company has lawyers that can deal with this.", "NTA. I used to work in auto insurance (service, sales, claims, underwriting, basically everything). You absolutely did the right thing. While it\u2019s true they wouldn\u2019t have been caught had you not caused the accident, they also wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if they didn\u2019t do something illegal. Turn the argument around, \u201cIf you had not driven illegally, this accident never would have happened so you should pay for the accident I caused\u201d and you can see how absurd their argument is. \n\nOne of my more ridiculous stories from my insurance jobs was a driver who was driving drunk.

He apparently tried to argue with the judge for the charges to be dismissed based on this logic. Simply incredible.", "NTA, because you *are* paying for the accident you caused, just through your insurance. \n\nAnd although I wouldn't be surprised if his own insurance declines to pay him due to his violation of their policies, I *would* be quite surprised if *your* insurance doesn't have to shell out money to him substantially equivalent to the damage you caused.

It is then up to your insurance to take care of it (the purpose of insurance). You are not responsible for their poor choices resulting in a claim denial along with the other fines. If they didn't want to have any problems while they are low income, they should have played it safe and not behaved as they did. If they actually tried to look around, they would likely have found some way of getting help running errands and the like.  At this point, since the husband called you and got angry with you, you should probably report to your insurance company that the husband made contact and was aggressive with you. Even if their own lawyers can't help you with this, they can likely point you in the right direction. Also, do not help them with rent or food. I get that you feel guilty overall, but all that they are doing is manipulating you. Your only knowledge that they are low income is because THEY said so. That may not actually be true. Either way, providing them any assistance just opens the door for them to abuse your kindness (and finances) at any point in time even long after you have paid off the costs of the damage to the vehicle (which is ALL you should be responsible for). Again, if they did not want to pay fines and get into trouble (they've probably lost their own insurance now and no-one else will want to pick them up given the reason for the loss), they should not have played the dangerous gamble that they did. Those problems are entirely on them and the only reason that the accident with you is involved is because that is what go them caught. If the accident hadn't happened, the lady may have been pulled over a mile further up the road for something else. They would have been found out then with the same consequences save for fixing the vehicle. Or perhaps they would never have been caught.

I called the police about 15 years ago when someone raked the side of my parked car (that I happened to still be sitting in) while pulling into the parking space next to me with more than enough room on either side to avoid coming within a foot of my car.

The police took their sweet time showing up, so I reluctantly ended up exchanging info with them instead. Surprise, surprise, it turned out they had no insurance, which was why they were so against my calling the police. I'm sure they would've just hightailed it outta there if I hadn't been right there to confront them. And then a few years later some guy smashed into the back of my car at a red light, we were both stopped, and then, for some reason, he decided to accelerate even though the light hadn't changed. He begged me to let him pay for the repairs out of pocket instead of going through insurance. I didn't agree to that. It turns out he had an awful driving record and couldn't \"afford\" to have another accident against his insurance.

Of course you need to make sure you get a copy of the paper from the courthouse listing her fines & repair estimates from no less than 3 licensed repair shops for the damages. Do this before handing over any money.

I once worked grave shift in a sweatshop where a large portion of our workforce drove without a license. It wasn't because they couldn't pass the drivers test. In fact, many of them were particularly safe drivers, because they knew the immense risk they were taking.

I had a coworker whose car broke down, and when he couldn't make the night shift, his family became homeless. Reliable transportation is essential.\n\nWe don't know what this family's story is. Maybe she's failed the drivers license a dozen times, has a foot of lead, and thinks turn signals are optional.

Luckily no one was hurt and I learned better safety with securing animals (he only rides back seat now with the full set up for those who might concerned.) \n\nAnyways, I bumped my neighbors car. And I do mean *bumped*. I got out and looked for the damage but could not find any in broad daylight. Despite that,I went and knocked on her door and told her what happened. Tbh, if I were a shitty person, I could\u2019ve probably pretended it never happened and she would probably have never noticed. But we went and looked at it together and eventually found the *tiniest* little dent. No paint had even come off her car, nor had mine been transferred onto it.\n\nWe talked about what to do. We were both concerned that it would increase our insurance, and I was worried it would be hard on her to deal with her insurance because she was older. So I told her to take it it wherever she liked and come back with a quote and I would pay it. She said she would take it to her dealer. I figured at worst it would be a couple grand from labor, getting rid of the dent and mostly general upcharge.\n\nThey quoted her 11 *thousand* dollars. They spelled out exactly why. 70% was man hours for labor. The damage listed was about as Minaj as I expected. It was also a Lexus which I hadn\u2019t realized because it was not an expensive looking car. I heavily apologized and told her I\u2019d like to go through with insurance after all because I honestly could not afford that amount of money to fix it, and I couldnt find it without saving for months. I told her I\u2019d be honest and extremely adamant it was my fault, but that she could call first and report it if that made her feel better. She let me call and I explain clearly how it was completely my fault. \n\nIt was a pain for both of us, but especially her I\u2019m not gonna lie. My insurance tried to under cut her and take advantage of her age and inability to understand the app they wanted her to use to file how to take correct photos etc, but I kept calling them to step in. In the end my insurance didn\u2019t even go up except like 10$ a month and she came back with her car fixed and looking brand new.\n\nBut it was almost really bad, for me. Never ever try to opt out of calling your insurance for whatever reason. It will not end well.", "She fucked around, and she found out.\n\nNTA. This is why you have insurance.
