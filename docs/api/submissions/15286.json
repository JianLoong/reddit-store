I have my own business and work very hard and sometimes very long hours to prioritize my clients, get positive referrals and maintain professional relationships. \n\nAlex is in 2nd grade and I get him up, ready and take him to school in the mornings. Anna picks Alex up in the afternoons and takes him to therapy and extracurriculars when he has those, does homework, packs his lunches and does the bedtime routine. We split anything else.\n\nRiley is exclusively breastfed and still wakes up 2-3 times a night. Anna always gets Riley at night so I can sleep, but she ends up sleeping during his long morning nap from 7-10.\n\nBesides that, Anna is a sahm mom and she runs the back end of my business. Basically, she takes care of Riley, the house stuff, handles our finances, errands and  simple office tasks like, emails, scanning, filling, setting appts, data entry, follow-ups, etc... While I'm the one actually going out and working every day face to face with clients, trying to get business and pacify ones that are frustrated or unhappy about something.\n\n\nWhen I'm at home, and not busy, we split household chores and most baby care 50/50. I try to do my part as much as possible. \nNeedless to say, my job doesn't end at 5/6pm. It's common for me to be dealing with people at 9/10pm because I want my clients to be happy and feel confident in me. I also attend networking events usually 3/4 nights a week until 8:30/9pm to make more connections and get my name out there.\n\nAnna knows and sees how much I work. She knows I'm busting my ass all day, but she's always on my case. I don't prioritize her and the kids, I cancel plans last minute to network, I forget promises I made to Alex. I'm missing out on bonding with Riley. Every day she has a new complaint. I've told her many times, I'm doing all of this for her and the kids, so they can have a better life and she doesn't have to work. I'm taking care of them. Anyway, I ended up hitting my limit with Anna's complaining and kind of blew up yelling at her to grow up and stop being so selfish for once and think about me. Now she's not speaking to me and I'm thinking maybe I was a little harsh on her.

YTA  Let's recap, shall we?\n\n* You get to sleep all night every night while your wife plays catch up on 3 hours of sleep in the morning.\n* You get Alex ready for school and take him to school, your wife does EVERYTHING ELSE for him, with a baby on her hip.\n* You work stupidly long hours and go out drinking (sorry, \"NETWORKING\") with potential clients 3-4 nights a week.  \n* Your wife manages the house, handles everything that happens, pays all the bills, parents both kids by herself, and RUNS YOUR BUSINESS FOR YOU.  \n\nWhen was the last time Anna had a night off?  or was able to spend time on anything for herself?  \n\nYou have the gall to say that she's a SAHM and doesn't work?  \"emails, scanning, filling, setting appts, data entry, follow-ups, etc.\"  This is the equivalent of at least a part-time job, why aren't you paying her for the work she does for YOUR company?  \n\nYou need to back the fuck up and realize how unselfish she is that she supports you to the extent that she does.

While I'm the one* **actually** *going out and working\"*\n\nShe is working. She is doing two, multiple-faceted,  things at once.She handles business and is a SAHM which is a huge job in itself. She is doing just as much as you and ACTUALLY working.

I don\u2019t doubt that you\u2019re working hard, but so is Anna. She isn\u2019t bringing you complaints as someone who isn\u2019t working just as hard as you do, she is overworked and exhausted as well. This comes across as you invalidating everything she does which is **A LOT.**\n\nYTA - Her concerns are valid, and instead of listening to her and trying to come to a compromise, you walled her off until you exploded. And you exploded like a child, so you\u2019re the one who really needs to grow up in this situation. She came to you with concerns like an adult, and you did not respond like an adult.\n\nI get that you\u2019re overworked. So is she. But you can\u2019t let that work get in the way of communicating with your partner or being there for your family when it matters. She is still communicating despite how overworked she is, so you can\u2019t use that as an excuse. You need to apologize and try to actually come to a solution.

Because you're not 'taking care of them' right now, you're placing your job above your family's happiness and actively neglecting them in the process. Also, there's no 'kind of' about the way you blew up at your wife; you went the full hog.\n\nFinally, as other people have pointed out, your wife isn't just a SAHM; she is running the back end of your business too - with sleep deprivation on top of it all, because apparently your rest is more important than hers.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

And your wife is trying to clue you into this.\n\nTrust me that there is no amount of money, there is no client deal sufficiently large, that it will wipe out a broken promise to your kids. Kids remember that forever. They will remember the missed recitals and the fact that you didn't read them the story you promised at bedtime. And they will learn that you are not a person to be trusted in their lives. They will not attach to you securely. And you will not be a part of their lives when they grow up.\n\nAnd are you cancelling plans you made with your wife? Are you actually prioritizing your marriage and doing a date night once a week? Or are you slacking on this to network also?\n\nThere are guys that post here all of the time, shocked that their wives have filed for divorce, claiming there was no warning signs.

You want to prioritize your clients, you say you want them to know you will drop everything for them, and then you said maybe when it gets going well you will hire people. So here is the thing, you are working hard to establish your business and currently using unpaid help to do so. You are working way more than full time hours. Your idea is to \u2018grow\u2019 this business, which means you will have to keep working just as hard and then when you can\u2019t possibly take on another thing you will hire someone who you have to take more time to train, and then, THEN, you will have to pay that person and so your take home income will be lower so you will be going out trying to increase business again to stay at a steady income level. It won\u2019t stop. Your prioritizing your clients over everything else in your life will continue to happen.

I have my own business and work very hard and sometimes very long hours to prioritize my clients, get positive referrals and maintain professional relationships. \n\nAlex is in 2nd grade and I get him up, ready and take him to school in the mornings. Anna picks Alex up in the afternoons and takes him to therapy and extracurriculars when he has those, dies homework, packs his lunches and does the bedtime routine. We split anything else.\n\nRiley is exclusively breastfed and still wakes up 2-3 times a night. Anna always gets Riley at night so I can sleep, but she ends up sleeping during his long morning nap from 7-10.\n\nBesides that, Anna is a sahm mom and she runs the back end of my business. Basically, she takes care of Riley, the house stuff, handles our finances, errands and  simple office tasks like, emails, scanning, filling, setting appts, data entry, follow-ups, etc... While I'm the one actually going out and working every day face to face with clients, trying to get business and pacify ones that are frustrated or unhappy about something.\n\n\nWhen I'm at home, and not busy, we split household chores 50/50. I try to do my part as much as possible. \nNeedless to say, my job doesn't end at 5/6pm. It's common for me to be dealing with people at 9/10pm because I want my clients to be happy and feel confident in me. I also attend networking events usually 3 nights a week until 8:30/9pm to make more connections and get my name out there.\n\nAnna knows and sees how much I work. She knows I'm busting my ass all day, but she's always on my case. I don't prioritize her and the kids, I cancel plans last minute to network, I forget promises I made to Alex. I'm missing out on bonding with Riley. Every day she has a new complaint. I've told her many times, I'm doing all of this for her and the kids, so they can have a better life and she doesn't have to work. I'm taking care of them. Anyway, I ended up hitting my limit with Anna's complaining and kind of blew up yelling at her to grow up and stop being so selfish for once and think about me. Now she's not speaking to me and I'm thinking maybe I was a little harsh on her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because it seems that\u2019s exactly what you really want.", "It is intentional. You are intentionally prioritizing clients over your family. Your son needs you, how do you not understand that? Your clients can be without you for an hour long bike ride.", "Reddit lingo \n/s = sarcasm \n\nI wholeheartedly agree no nap is the same as an actual uninterrupted sleep.", "I currently work 6/7 days a week and plan to for the next 6 months or so. Just until I feel sufficiently established.", "RIGHT", "I\u2019ve literally responded to what you said to me, in no way have I rewritten your point. If you don\u2019t want to respond then don\u2019t, but don\u2019t make out that I shamed you when in fact I did no such thing as none of this personal to you.", "The nice thing is when Anna divorces him, she'll actually get more free time and money out of it. Good for her.", "... we were talking about the days your wife helps you...", "How many days does your wife work?", "INFO: So, how much time do you actually spend with your wife and kids, and is that gonna remain the same 'until (you) feel sufficiently established'?", "Anna work 7 days a week 24/7 as a SAHM plus she runs your house and works for you.  You don\u2019t work even half the hours she does.", "\"But you can't say op has no job but being a shamp is a job\"\n\n\nI never said being a shamp is a job. Ops wife works 20 hours a week for a buisness. She is an unpaid employee of her husband buisness. Doing that much for a buisness is not house work or child raising- not a sahp.\n\n\nI didn't say op doesn't work. A job normally means having employment. He is having a buisness. And that this is a dicision driven by op.\n\n\nThe average hourly pay of an accountant is 28$ in the us. Op is working 6-7 days (not even counting networking). That is an average of 52 hours a week. 4 weeks a month are 204 hours. Would be an income of 68.000 \u20ac. \n\nNow, even the wife would only making minimum wage she would earn 500 a month. That are 6000 $ more he would make to make the buisness actually lukrative if he is working for her and the kids. \n\n\nSo 74.000 $. \n\n\nNow, even if his buisness makes more than that it would not justify bullshitting her or kids (canceling or forgetting promises).\n\n\nBut if he makes under 74000 the family would be better off fincially with him working a 9-5 job and him watching the kids in the evenings/weekends and her working a part time job. \n\nIn total they would have more money and less hours.", "I also thought that you rewrote it and starting beating on a strawman.  Being self employed is a lot of work, it is not a job.  The part about being a SAHM being a luxury seemed irreverent since the OPs wife is not a SAHM.", "If I'm working that day, Anna probably has a few things business related to do at home.", "So she\u2019s working for a few hours 6-7 days a week?", "Holy shit. Your wife works 28 hours a week and watches your baby 24/7 and watches your older kid in the afternoons. \nShe\u2019s going to have a breakdown and you won\u2019t be able to afford 3 people to replace her. I guess you\u2019ll appreciate her once your business goes under.", "Alright.   If it\u2019s only a few things, and those things are easy, then you won\u2019t mind doing them yourself.  \n\nIf you feel like this is unreasonable, then you need to acknowledge that your wife is contributing significantly.", "INFO: If you had to pay someone to do the work she does in a week, would would their weekly salary be?", "25 hours a week at least, probably more.", "Your wife is working harder than you. Full stop."]}
