I have my own business and work very hard and sometimes very long hours to prioritize my clients, get positive referrals and maintain professional relationships. \n\nAlex is in 2nd grade and I get him up, ready and take him to school in the mornings. Anna picks Alex up in the afternoons and takes him to therapy and extracurriculars when he has those, does homework, packs his lunches and does the bedtime routine. We split anything else.\n\nRiley is exclusively breastfed and still wakes up 2-3 times a night. Anna always gets Riley at night so I can sleep, but she ends up sleeping during his long morning nap from 7-10.\n\nBesides that, Anna is a sahm mom and she runs the back end of my business. Basically, she takes care of Riley, the house stuff, handles our finances, errands and  simple office tasks like, emails, scanning, filling, setting appts, data entry, follow-ups, etc... While I'm the one actually going out and working every day face to face with clients, trying to get business and pacify ones that are frustrated or unhappy about something.\n\n\nWhen I'm at home, and not busy, we split household chores and most baby care 50/50. I try to do my part as much as possible. \nNeedless to say, my job doesn't end at 5/6pm. It's common for me to be dealing with people at 9/10pm because I want my clients to be happy and feel confident in me. I also attend networking events usually 3/4 nights a week until 8:30/9pm to make more connections and get my name out there.\n\nAnna knows and sees how much I work. She knows I'm busting my ass all day, but she's always on my case. I don't prioritize her and the kids, I cancel plans last minute to network, I forget promises I made to Alex. I'm missing out on bonding with Riley. Every day she has a new complaint. I've told her many times, I'm doing all of this for her and the kids, so they can have a better life and she doesn't have to work. I'm taking care of them. Anyway, I ended up hitting my limit with Anna's complaining and kind of blew up yelling at her to grow up and stop being so selfish for once and think about me. Now she's not speaking to me and I'm thinking maybe I was a little harsh on her. AITA?\n\nEdit: because so many people have asked why Alex is in therapy: Alex was SA by someone Anna and I mistakenly thought we could trust. It happened several months ago and Alex is in therapy to process and work through that incident.", "created_utc": 1682020768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tda9c/aita_for_finally_snapping_at_my_wife/", "score": 4729, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t doubt that you\u2019re working hard, but so is Anna. She isn\u2019t bringing you complaints as someone who isn\u2019t working just as hard as you do, she is overworked and exhausted as well.

And you exploded like a child, so you\u2019re the one who really needs to grow up in this situation. She came to you with concerns like an adult, and you did not respond like an adult.\n\nI get that you\u2019re overworked. So is she. But you can\u2019t let that work get in the way of communicating with your partner or being there for your family when it matters. She is still communicating despite how overworked she is, so you can\u2019t use that as an excuse. You need to apologize and try to actually come to a solution.

Because you're not 'taking care of them' right now, you're placing your job above your family's happiness and actively neglecting them in the process. Also, there's no 'kind of' about the way you blew up at your wife; you went the full hog.\n\nFinally, as other people have pointed out, your wife isn't just a SAHM; she is running the back end of your business too - with sleep deprivation on top of it all, because apparently your rest is more important than hers.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

Kids remember that forever. They will remember the missed recitals and the fact that you didn't read them the story you promised at bedtime. And they will learn that you are not a person to be trusted in their lives. They will not attach to you securely. And you will not be a part of their lives when they grow up.\n\nAnd are you cancelling plans you made with your wife? Are you actually prioritizing your marriage and doing a date night once a week? Or are you slacking on this to network also?\n\nThere are guys that post here all of the time, shocked that their wives have filed for divorce, claiming there was no warning signs.

I have my own business and work very hard and sometimes very long hours to prioritize my clients, get positive referrals and maintain professional relationships. \n\nAlex is in 2nd grade and I get him up, ready and take him to school in the mornings. Anna picks Alex up in the afternoons and takes him to therapy and extracurriculars when he has those, dies homework, packs his lunches and does the bedtime routine. We split anything else.\n\nRiley is exclusively breastfed and still wakes up 2-3 times a night. Anna always gets Riley at night so I can sleep, but she ends up sleeping during his long morning nap from 7-10.\n\nBesides that, Anna is a sahm mom and she runs the back end of my business. Basically, she takes care of Riley, the house stuff, handles our finances, errands and  simple office tasks like, emails, scanning, filling, setting appts, data entry, follow-ups, etc... While I'm the one actually going out and working every day face to face with clients, trying to get business and pacify ones that are frustrated or unhappy about something.\n\n\nWhen I'm at home, and not busy, we split household chores 50/50. I try to do my part as much as possible. \nNeedless to say, my job doesn't end at 5/6pm. It's common for me to be dealing with people at 9/10pm because I want my clients to be happy and feel confident in me. I also attend networking events usually 3 nights a week until 8:30/9pm to make more connections and get my name out there.\n\nAnna knows and sees how much I work. She knows I'm busting my ass all day, but she's always on my case. I don't prioritize her and the kids, I cancel plans last minute to network, I forget promises I made to Alex. I'm missing out on bonding with Riley. Every day she has a new complaint. I've told her many times, I'm doing all of this for her and the kids, so they can have a better life and she doesn't have to work. I'm taking care of them. Anyway, I ended up hitting my limit with Anna's complaining and kind of blew up yelling at her to grow up and stop being so selfish for once and think about me. Now she's not speaking to me and I'm thinking maybe I was a little harsh on her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is absolutely no way the chore split is anywhere near 50/50 if he spends that little time in the house lmao he's delusional", "OMG this sounds like my. x husband.", "For. Fuckin.

There is no way she is getting all those tasks done In 25 hrs per week. She is basically running the business, while OP handles sales. But OP has decided that his \u2018people skills\u2019 are so much more valuable than the skills and organization it takes to run a business that all the boring stuff is below his pay grade. She is doing all the boring shit work and he is doing the interesting stuff, going out and meeting with clients, talking to grown ups, eating food that isn\u2019t whatever her kids left on the plate. \n\n2. OP has to \u2018make a good impression on his clients\u2019 of course. And you know what they say: \u2018you gotta spend money to make money\u2019 and \u2018fake it til you make it\u2019. I\u2019m sure OP believes the client needs to see that you\u2019re doing well, and that he believes that as painful as it may be for him, he has to dress well, eat and drink well, drive a nice car, etc. And of course, since his wife is doing all that boring and unimportant stuff like actually raising a family 24/7 and running the actual business that OP does the selling for. And  since she just does all the drudgey shit work \u2014up to her elbows in diapers and paperwork ensuring that OP makes good impression by getting numbers right, meeting deadlines, filing tax shit and whatever else, she doesn\u2019t need nice clothes or need to eat out or even leave the house really,  except for getting groceries. \n\n3. OP has to do networking  several nights a week because impressing colleagues and other people in your field is just as important as impressing clients. I\u2019m going to assume that referrals must be a huge part of his income. Of course, he has to go to nice places and have nice clothes  and an impressive car, and he has to treat everyone sometimes, and he has to spend money like he\u2019s making lots of money so that means ordering good food and drinks again. I\u2019m really curious about the field OP works in because the only thing I can think of where referrals are so important is real estate, but those are out of town referrals and you can\u2019t hang out with agents from other cities a few times each week. But, again, as awful as it is, that\u2019s a few more times each week that OP has to be away from the diapers, the dishes, the chaos and drudgery, and dress up to go out and eat good food with grown ups, while his wife gets to chill at home and relax while looking after kids, cooking food, changing diapers, bathing kids, nursing the baby, helping the big kid with homework or whatever, putting the kids to bed and then most likely getting caught up on paper work etc for her little business management hobby and basically lazing around. \n\n4. OP\u2019s job obviously doesn\u2019t end at 5pm because that\u2019s when networking and client meeting happen and he has to go hang around with grown ups in grown up spaces eating, drinking, being generous and appearing wealthy to build their confidence in him. Whereas his wife\u2019s job stops everytime she has to go do her other job. If she wants a break from paperwork,  she can cook a meal or change a diaper and when she needs a break from the kids, she can always catch up on paperwork and it should be easy for her to keep up, because paperwork is one of those things she can do while she\u2019s nursing the baby at 3am. As I read the post, her eight year old goes to school and so it\u2019s not like she has two kids with her for 24 hours a day. From about 8:30 to 3pm she only has the baby with her. So she\u2019s only looking after both kids for about 18 hours a day. The rest of the time, she just has the baby, and she can change and dress him, feed him or express some milk for later, strap him into his car seat and take him anywhere. She can even feed him while doing paper work in the waiting room while the bigger kid is in therapy. So she even gets to go out. \n\nC\u2019mon my guy. This is ridiculous.  \n\n\n\nYep. And when OP decides he would rather be with a younger, \u2018more energetic\u2019 woman who prioritized him instead of his business ans his kids, I\u2019ll bet dollars to donuts he claims he did all the work building up \u201chis\u201d business (he really called it that in his post, I went back and checked!!!) so she shouldn\u2019t get any part of it in the divorce.\n\nHis business. He\u2019s the salesman for her business and he takes advantage of that to enjoy extra nights out networking no less.", "I highly suspect she spends more than 25 hours a week on his shit.

Such TA", "I worked in Real Estate, I probably only schmoozed at networking events maybe every couple of months but there would be certain agents who may be in commercial or cater to different clientele in different ways.

Admin are the backbone of any institution and I was incredibly grateful for the tireless work of the admin team. They don't get to stretch their legs and get fresh air between clients like I had the good fortune of so I made sure to show my gratitude by grabbing anything they needed if I had time between clients. The least he could do would be to return the favour and show his WIFE gratitude. I also chose not go back into real estate in order to focus on family. It is hard to juggle with a family and in my opinion, family comes first. I do know of friends that still work in the industry and many of the dad's still prioritise family time and organize any networking and events around their families as much as possible. Some are also in their first or second year. \n\nI admit I wondered if he was in the marketing, medical, finance or legal industry, as I don't know many real estate agents who network that often, especially the ones with family. But what he does is irrelevant. I understand he is building a business but it's definitely possible to do so and still prioritise your family and have some flexibility to not work quite as many evenings. His work life balance is very poor. There's pressure starting out, no doubt but it shouldn't come at a great sacrifice for the family and in my opinion, kids need love and time with their parents more than financial benefits. As long as they have their needs met and a decent lifestyle, the main thing any child will always choose over anything money can buy, is love and time with their parents. I can understand he may have their best interests at heart with their futures, college funds etc to help them have a great start in adulthood but they also need him now and you can't get back those precious early years. It is possible for him to achieve both these things if he created some more balance in his life. He may feel less stressed and happier to. The joy and laughter playtime with his children can cultivate is one of the best medicines around.\n\nI also cannot stand the attitude of I don't clock off until X amount of time yet his wife isn't clocking off at all. 24/7 she is on call to her newborn's needs. That shouldn't be diminished at all. If only they could switch roles for a week, in fact if it were possible, it would be amazing for both to see the others perspectives but his wife is absolutely within her right to feel this way and voice her concerns which are 100% valid. It's him who needs to appreciate his wife, not the other way around here as I'm sure she values what he is doing.

She\u2019s up several times a night, EVERY night, for at least 40-60min each time because that\u2019s how long it takes to feed a baby.  Then she gets up early with the kids.  She might get 2-3 hours uninterrupted sleep during the day if she\u2019s lucky, and then it\u2019s more cooking, cleaning, caring for kids, etc until they go down for bed, apparently with very little help from you since you\u2019re out meeting with clients or \u201cnetworking\u201d all hours of the evening.  Between all this, she\u2019s running the back end of your business, handling the family\u2019s finances, all the doctor and therapy (does one of your kids have special needs?) appointments, and everything else you don\u2019t make time for.

You\u2019re providing nothing more than a paycheck to your family while your wife is drowning, and when she asks you for help she only receives your disdain.  If what she does for your family or your business is so basic, you should have no trouble hiring someone to either help with your business or care for your kids, so that your poor wife can catch a break and work only one full time job, just like you do.  Or, perhaps you could just work on showing the f*ck up and keeping your word to your family. \n\nWhatever you do, you\u2019d better figure it out soon or you\u2019ll be forking over half that paycheck to your estranged ex-family.", "Wtf else is going on that your 2nd grader needs therapy?", "YTA stop breaking promises to your kids (and I assume also wife), start spending quality time with your family, stop diminishing the amount of work your wife does and start openly acknowledging and appreciating it, and for god sakes stop going out \"networking\" so much. Once a month is more than enough, you don't have time for more than that (3 to 4 times a week is just lazily avoiding doing actual work / helping, regardless of how you try to justify it) \n\nAlso maybe hire some help for your wife.", "Many have explained quite succinctly the numerous reasons as to why you're a huge asshole, and they're absolutely correct. Your views on your wife's contributions are also very short-sighted, the value you place on all she has on her plate compared to your own are dim-witted, and the importance you place on your financial means over your family's well being are errant. These will one day be your downfall as a husband and father, and that will undeniably be on you if you don't catch a clue, get your shit together and do the work required to find a healthy balance all across the board. Inevitably, you will likely be alone and bitter. Ask yourself, is that truly what you wish to work so hard to earn? Because if that does happen, it will unquestionably be well earned. And sadly, not a single client will give a rat's bum about any of that, or about you. They quite possibly will not even readily recall your name by then. That is precisely the future you're so diligently working toward, and you seem to believe this to be somehow generous and commendable. \n\n\nMake no mistake about it. Contrary to the script you repeat to yourself like some fool hardy mantra, the harsh reality is that you are not authentically doing this for them, though you believe you are in your own mind (where you seem to paint yourself as a legend). You are, in actuality, really doing this primarily for yourself. Your status. Your ego. Your success (as a provider, a husband and father, separate from your success as a businessman). \n\n\nThe most valuable thing one person can give to another is their time and attention, which is why it's said that \"time is money.\" Time, especially quality bonding time, cannot be bought, forcibly taken,  or earned. It is freely given and willingly received. Your family quite likely does not, will not, find your best time and efforts spent appeasing your clientele nearly as noble as you appear to. You should come down off of your high horse, breathe in a hefty dose of reality, and learn what truly matters in life because all you're doing is bartering your most important relationships for a bit of temporal cash. Money is essential, don't get me wrong. Starting a business is very difficult and demanding, for sure. Regardless, if you continue to nurture your clientele and business venture to this degree the chances of it costing you your wife (at best, and children/potential future generational family ties at worst). You will quite likely pay dearly for that one day, with consequences no excuses will appease and no amount of money can buy your way out of. \n\nRemember this: the grass is always greenest on the side where somebody is actually there, watering it. Right now that's what your wife is doing. Alone. While you're too busy to notice. \n\nYes, YTA. As a matter of observation you present yourself to be one of those unbearable A-holes with a dreadful lack of appreciation for those closest to you, one who's harboring a disturbing sense of self-righteousness, one with a fatal deficiency of insightfulness and understanding.\n\nYou would benefit from holding up a mirror and chanting your own words into it: grow up and stop being so selfish for once and think about... your family, your future, and your shortcomings that need tending (such as the superiority complex you carry like a chip on your shoulder, it's now eeking out of your lips like a slow-acting poison).\n\n\n* ETA sentence clarity and fix typo", "YTA.
