I just found out earlier this week that my dog has stage 4 kidney failure and needs close monitoring for the foreseeable future; because of this, I took a 30 day unpaid leave of absence from my job and spent almost 2 grand for an appointment with a specialist for my dog. I called and told her that I was sorry, but I couldn't make it to her bachelorette weekend. She said it was fine and then the next day told me she had canceled the trip all together because the 3rd bridesmaid was also unsure about going. We're all in our mid-early twenties, and needless to say broke, except for her. Im not saying shes rich but shes not holding on for dear life like most of us in the bridal party. She said because the cancellation was so close the the reservation date we couldn't get a refund. \n\nWe have to pay 540$ for the trip. There was also a 500$ boat excursion that had to be canceled and paid for, which she agreed to eat the cost of because its what she chose for us to do. She said we would split it 3 ways, her, me, and the 3rd bridesmaid. I asked why it wasn't going to be split 4 or 5 ways considering as how her mother and aunt were also supposed to stay there with us. I understood the 1st bridesmaid backed out before the trip had to be canceled so she was excluded, but everyone else had still been planned to go. She said that I must have been joking and that she asked her mother to go and she shouldn't have to pay anything, same with her aunt. Keep in mind she also wants us to stay at a cabin for her wedding for 2 nights where the rooms are 200$ a night. After some arguing back and forth she agreed to split it 4 ways.

Ive never heard of a bachelorette party where you cover the costs for not only the bride, but her family members. It used to be just a fun night out at the clubs\u2026 now it\u2019s a financial nightmare.", "NTA. Was she expecting her aunt and mom to\nGo for free? Everyone should be paying their share of the trip unless otherwise agreed upon.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't need to pay for her aunt and mother. If the bride feels they shouldn't pay she can pay their cut herself.\n\nHad you ended up going, would she have expected you to pay her mother's and aunt's share?", "NTA. Your friend is nuts. As you said you had a lot going on and this person was doing better than the others coming too and she demands more money? You also saved up 2k to see your dog who had kidney failure. Either your friend is heartless as hell or she doesn't know which is still bad because thats a lot to pay for when the event DIDN'T happen.", "If asking them to go means everyone else pays more, then she should have gotten your permission to invite them. What kind of friend would increase your bill without even asking you?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It should be split equally.", "NTA. There is a lot of things people can push for when they're getting married, but how people should pay for things isn't one of them. Anyone that was going on the trip should cough up their fair share, even if it is her mother and Aunt. The only person that really shouldn't have to pay would have been the bride to be.", "NTA, her mom and aunt should be paying their fair share", "What were the cost sharing plans if the trip had gone ahead?", "I\u2019m leaning slight NTA. I think mentioning her income is unfair, like if she was one of the bridesmaids that should be irrelevant. However, I also think weddings like this are stupid. So it\u2019s your big day so you get to force people to spend money outside of their comfort zone? As the Bride, who wanted this, it\u2019s more on her but it sounds like she already did take the biggest hit with the boat. It also sucks for her that this is clearly a big thing for her and everyone backed out, not your fault since your dog was sick, but it still does suck. \n\nIt\u2019s a crappy situation, because assuming she\u2019s going to do all the stupid bridesmaids stuff for y\u2019all one day, then she pulled the short stick with this trip and you could just make it easier on her and split it the 3 way. However, personally, I would never do a bridesmaids trip unless I could pay for everyone. Plus, she knows your dog is sick, and you\u2019re loosing a ton of money there, so as a friend, she could help you out too.", "NTA\n\nShe's being entitled.\n\nWhy should you have to pay for her mum and aunt?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
