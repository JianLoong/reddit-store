I just found out earlier this week that my dog has stage 4 kidney failure and needs close monitoring for the foreseeable future; because of this, I took a 30 day unpaid leave of absence from my job and spent almost 2 grand for an appointment with a specialist for my dog. I called and told her that I was sorry, but I couldn't make it to her bachelorette weekend. She said it was fine and then the next day told me she had canceled the trip all together because the 3rd bridesmaid was also unsure about going. We're all in our mid-early twenties, and needless to say broke, except for her. Im not saying shes rich but shes not holding on for dear life like most of us in the bridal party. She said because the cancellation was so close the the reservation date we couldn't get a refund. \n\nWe have to pay 540$ for the trip. There was also a 500$ boat excursion that had to be canceled and paid for, which she agreed to eat the cost of because its what she chose for us to do. She said we would split it 3 ways, her, me, and the 3rd bridesmaid. I asked why it wasn't going to be split 4 or 5 ways considering as how her mother and aunt were also supposed to stay there with us.I just want to say, I knew the mother and aunt were going; what I didn't know, is that they weren't paying to stay there as well. I understood the 1st bridesmaid backed out before the trip had to be canceled so she was excluded, but everyone else had still been planned to go. She said that I must have been joking and that she asked her mother to go and she shouldn't have to pay anything, same with her aunt. Keep in mind she also wants us to stay at a cabin for her wedding for 2 nights where the rooms are 200$ a night. After some arguing back and forth she agreed to split it 4 ways. And she told me I was a bad friend for even suggesting it. Am I the Asshole? For those who said they were confused, the family was going to stay the entire three days, and the bride just informed me that she hadn't planned for them to pay anything for the cabin.", "created_utc": 1690543527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15buqu1/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_split_the_cost_of_a/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ive never heard of a bachelorette party where you cover the costs for not only the bride, but her family members. It used to be just a fun night out at the clubs\u2026 now it\u2019s a financial nightmare.", "NTA. Was she expecting her aunt and mom to\nGo for free? Everyone should be paying their share of the trip unless otherwise agreed upon.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't need to pay for her aunt and mother. If the bride feels they shouldn't pay she can pay their cut herself.\n\nHad you ended up going, would she have expected you to pay her mother's and aunt's share?", "NTA. Your friend is nuts. As you said you had a lot going on and this person was doing better than the others coming too and she demands more money? You also saved up 2k to see your dog who had kidney failure. Either your friend is heartless as hell or she doesn't know which is still bad because thats a lot to pay for when the event DIDN'T happen.", "If asking them to go means everyone else pays more, then she should have gotten your permission to invite them. What kind of friend would increase your bill without even asking you?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It should be split equally.", "NTA. There is a lot of things people can push for when they're getting married, but how people should pay for things isn't one of them. Anyone that was going on the trip should cough up their fair share, even if it is her mother and Aunt. The only person that really shouldn't have to pay would have been the bride to be.", "NTA, her mom and aunt should be paying their fair share", "What were the cost sharing plans if the trip had gone ahead?", "I\u2019m leaning slight NTA. I think mentioning her income is unfair, like if she was one of the bridesmaids that should be irrelevant. However, I also think weddings like this are stupid. So it\u2019s your big day so you get to force people to spend money outside of their comfort zone? As the Bride, who wanted this, it\u2019s more on her but it sounds like she already did take the biggest hit with the boat. It also sucks for her that this is clearly a big thing for her and everyone backed out, not your fault since your dog was sick, but it still does suck. \n\nIt\u2019s a crappy situation, because assuming she\u2019s going to do all the stupid bridesmaids stuff for y\u2019all one day, then she pulled the short stick with this trip and you could just make it easier on her and split it the 3 way. However, personally, I would never do a bridesmaids trip unless I could pay for everyone. Plus, she knows your dog is sick, and you\u2019re loosing a ton of money there, so as a friend, she could help you out too.", "NTA\n\nShe's being entitled.\n\nWhy should you have to pay for her mum and aunt?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

WTF NTA op.\n\n Pay your share = reservation/#of people that should have gone  including her mommy and aunty. Considering she booked and planned  everything without your input all this she should consider herself lucky you are willing to pay a share.", "One of my friends had her mom and aunt at her bachelorette, they were fun!  But they also pretty much paid for everything except our drinks, so it\u2019s a different situation.", "NTA", "NTA. I would split the total by 5 and send her that amount. Then I would drop out of the wedding party before I went even more broke for someone else\u2019s Special Day.", "NTA\n\nShe hid the other two's cost in the figures she gave the bridesmaids. I wouldn't pay for her sneaked in \"extra guests.\" She invited them. She told them it was free. She never told, let alone got consent, from the bridesmaids to carry the extra cost. She pays for them.", "NTA.. she planned this and informed you afterwards- without knowing availability. She should pay for it all", "Nts. She invited her mom and aunt. You did not.  She can pay their share.  Do not back down to bridzilla. Give her 1/5 of the cost and refuse to give any more. That is your share.", "I\u2019m confused\u2014I\u2019m assuming the family members would have paid if they went in the trip, but they\u2019re expected to pay for the cancelled trip when they had no say in it being cancelled?", "Not uncommon in the UK for your parents to show up to your stag do/hen party along with aunts/uncles or even in-laws. \n\nHowever it's also common for them to show for a few hours, buy a few drinks, then gracefully bow out before the real degeneracy occurs.", "I've been to multiple bachelorette parties where moms and aunts were present, but they always just came out and bought us some drinks and then left. I don't think it's weird unless they're trying to hang out all night, and even then I guess it depends on their relationship - my mom parties way harder than me, so if I ever had a bachelorette she'd probably be able to stay out longer than I would lol \ud83d\ude02", "I don't, I find it odd the bride expects he friends to cover the costs for her family who are likely to be significantly more financially stable.", "Interesting.", "I\u2019ve seen moms/aunts at bridal showers but not bachelorettes.", "ESH\n\nThe bride for all the reasons people are saying.\n\nBut you because I don't trust your narrative. People who are \"holding on for dear life\" financially don't take 30 days unpaid leave and drop $2000 on a specialist for a dog with stage 4 kidney cancer. I get that you love your dog. I'm not criticizing that. Just saying that if you have those means, you are not holding on for dear life.", "I just want to say I knew the mother and aunt were going, what I didn't know is that they weren't paying to stay there as well. I added that to the post because there seems to be some mixup about that.", "NTA Don't discuss or defend, just split it four ways and send your share. You are not responsible for her family. Where I'm from, typically the bridal party/bach party attendees cover the cost for the bride.", "NTA.  So she was just going to allow all of you to pay for the cabin & not tell you that you were paying for her aunt & mother?  That is very sneaky.  Why should her aunt & mom get a free pass?  That's just completely unfair to the rest.  You are not a bad friend.  You're a friend who's strapped for cash.  Why do brides not understand that not everyone has money & can't afford their expensive & lavish bachelorette?  It's as if these type of brides expect everyone to just go into debt over their wedding.  It's ridiculous.", "NTA. Don't pay. You shouldn't have to subsidize her family. She needs to pay.", "NTA and in what world does the bride get to plan her own bachelorette party? The MOH usually plans it with the help of the bridesmaids because they all have a budget.\n\nAlso, who invites their mother and aunt to this? It's supposed to be party time for all the bridesmaids and the bride. Anyway, the mother and aunt should have to pay or the bride eats their splits too because she invited them without your approval.\n\nGood thing this \"bachelorette\" party fell through. It sounds horrible and I'd be pissed if she was planning on springing the fact that her mother and aunt were going too til last minute. Frankly, she sounds very dismissive of yours and the bridesmaids' finances and feelings.", "NTA", "NTA, time to walk away.", "NTA, I understand that you would pay for the bride but not her mum and aunt. The only hen weekend I've been at the bride actually paid for herself, I was expecting to share her portion of the cost with the other bridesmaids but she had such a better paid job that she paid for herself.", "I kinda get where she\u2019s confused here because her mom and aunt didn\u2019t cancel so why should they be out the $\n\nBut ultimately it sounds like a) she could have still attended with them and b) she was never going to ask them to pay? \n\nNTA", "NTA but i would also ask for receipts to be sure that she is actually not getting a refund because i just don't believe her.", "I got a Care credit to take care of the vet bills, my mother said to take the time off and she would help me with my bills, and I know it's not much but I've begun doordashing to make money because at least then I can take the dog with me. Taking the time of is definitely going to be a serious struggle financially for me and my family but I would rather have gone to the specialist and gotten all the information possible."]}
