I\u2019m still a minor so i have limited hours, but i like it a lot. on of my coworkers (we\u2019ll call him ethan) has severe mental disabilities/ issues. he often will leave everyone else to do the work and will say very uncomfortable things. as i mentioned, i am a minor. ethan has multiple times made jokes about me being a minor and asking if i still am one. he shows interest, but i have no want to reciprocate in the slightest. he also tries to push religious things such as bible verses on me and my coworkers. it makes me uncomfortable and i have voiced my uncomfort about the situation to multiple people. most people just shrug it off as ethan being ethan, but he makes me feel just extremely uncomfortable. he is 26, so the age gap is very very large. recently, our schedules haven\u2019t been matching, so i\u2019ve had a break. he switched shifts with ny other coworker last week, and started the same old routine. he will arrive about a half an hour before clocking in and just sit or follow me around the shop without saying anything. or he\u2019ll stare at me until i look because i can feel him staring and he\u2019ll quickly look away. i\u2019ve just started to ignore him. this particular day, we had a lot to do so i wasn\u2019t having any of it. i kept walking to the back where he was and not acknowledging him because i was preoccupied. he started throughout my shift trying to get my attention and i even asked him to please leave me alone because i wasn\u2019t having a good day. eventually i just began ignoring him altogether. i wasn\u2019t being rude, just doing my job and not talking to him like i usually do. he seemed to get really upset and mad and started acting all angry for the rest of the shift. the main problem i have is i know he doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m not interested, but i don\u2019t think i should have to keep putting myself in uncomfortable situations for his benefit. when i say uncomfortable, i mean like a grown man talking to me a 17 year old about his wet dreams.

If he is capable of having a job and going into society without adult supervision, then he is capable of understanding that sexual harassment is not ok and that his behaviour is predatory.

Report this to HR, your manager, or your boss immediately and tell your parents.

If that's \"Ethan just being Ethan\", then he needs to be fired. There is no excuse for this.  It is not your responsibility to put up with his creepy BS, and the company should have shut it down immediately.\n\nWelcome to the world of shitty employers.  I'm sorry you're stuck dealing with this situation so young, but it is an excellent opportunity to practice advocating for yourself and learning the line where employee responsibility ends and employer responsibility begins.\n\n If you're in the U.S., sexual harassment is federally illegal (most states also have laws against it, but even if they don't, the federal law protects you) and your employer has a duty to protect their employees from harassment.  This is a serious and potentially dangerous situation you're in, and they're trying to ignore it.\n\n If the company has an HR department, report it to them.  Otherwise tell your boss. If your boss doesn't do anything, escalate it to THEIR boss.  Make noise.  Be the squeaky wheel.  If your parents are the type to have your back, tell them and let them help advocate for you.  Bosses and landlords get away with a lot of B.S. because employees, especially young employees, don't know their rights and put up with blatantly illegal treatment. (Take it from someone who put up with way too much B.S. in her youth).\n\nDo your reporting via text or email, and save copies of everything.  You want to document not only Ethan's behavior, but the fact that you reported it and what response you received.  \"Lol, that's just Ethan\" is NOT an appropriate response.  If that's their action plan, make them put it in writing.\n\nThey have to make the problem stop right now, and make sure it doesn't happen again. How they do that is their problem, not yours.  Dealing with Ethan is above your pay grade. Make them earn their fat paycheck.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA this shouldn\u2019t need to escalate into even more egregious sexual harassment, it\u2019s already really bad now. TELL YOUR PARENTS AND TEACHERS IMMEDIATELY. \n1st thing- Write down ever date/time you can remember and what this guy has done and said. And any witnesses. He has a track record of being creepy towards a minor. \nThis will make it more obvious to the idiots who think this extremely disturbing and unacceptable behavior is okay. Sorry but you will always have to deal with this type of idiocy. It doesn\u2019t ever go away as a woman unfortunately.", "NTA. But if you want to stay working there and the problem persists or gets out of hand ... maybe you need to carry Mace with you just incase. \n\nYou've already set boundaries, informed others and tried to ignore the person. Don't use it on a whim of course, but definitely have it to protect yourself if Ethan can't behave himself.", "If you're in the US report it to the EEOC, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/what-you-should-know-what-do-if-you-believe-you-have-been-harassed-work", "NTA: I strongly recommend you tell the manager/HR/owner immediately and follow up with an email so you have documentation. This is not ok. The fact that you\u2019re a minor makes it worse, but it\u2019s wrong regardless. If it isn\u2019t resolved you need to contact an employment lawyer. You are being sexually harassed and put in an unsafe situation. THIS IS NOT OK.", "NTA. Whatever mental illness he has is irrelevant, he\u2019s harassing a minor coworker, and it\u2019s bordering on sexual harassment. You need to go to your manager and your parents.

It\u2019s not your fault nor your responsibility to look after a literal adult", "NTA.\n\nIs he mentally ill or does he have a intellectual disability?\n\nThese are two different things, but neither of these things are things you have to accept in your work environment.\n\nIf he's mentally ill and so unmanaged by his medication (or lack) that he's constantly harassing you, he's TAH.\n\nIf he's mentally disabled (special needs, handicapped, MRDD) your work is at fault and likely illegal. People with intellectual disabilities in the USA can be hired at a very very low wage. The point of the low wage is to encourage the employer to give the disabled person work, so they feel accomplished and good about themselves. These people need to have constant supervision and can't be truly thought of as a whole functioning employee. They need someone with them to help and guide, and that's why the wage is so low, it's to offset the cost of the employer that still needs staff to fill all positions, because whatever the disabled person is doing, it's not the same as a typical non-mentally disabled employee.\n\nIf you are a minor, you likely aren't legally qualified by age to provide proper supervision of your coworker. This is on your employer.\n\nIf the coworker was my child and had these behaviors, I would not want you, a minor, supervising my child. Because this grown man might have the mind of a child actually much younger than you, in a big adult body. It's dangerous for you and him.\n\nIf he assaults you, it will also be a trauma for him, because he might be incapable of understanding what is wrong.\n\nLots of people with intellectual disabilities don't understand their hormones and proper expression of human sexuality. It's like breathing and eating - feels good, so do it. They need someone to handle and redirect them.\n\nYou should still BE KIND, but talk to whoever your coworker lives with - the group home or their parents. I bet whoever is their guardian, they ALSO don't want you, a MINOR, left to manage their dependent. If their handicap child commits sexual assault, they will have the option to have the child punished and jailed just like someone who understands what they are doing, or long term committed to a mental hospital.\n\nIt's a shitty situation for all involved. Please speak out so you can protect yourself and your coworker, because they might be just as vulnerable.\n\nI am NOT saying you deserve to be in this situation or deserve to have anything happen to you. Understand that. You have a right to be safe. Always.\n\n- a parent of a mentally handicapped child.", "NTA. This is sexual harassment.

If this person is capable of having a job they are capable of knowing what they are doing is wrong, and if he does not have the capacity to understand he is doing wrong, he should not be working there.\n\nYou should speak to your manager again, tell them everything and if they try to brush it off tell them you will be reporting him to the police for harassment and inappropriate behaviour towards a minor and you will also be reporting the company for allowing you to work under unsafe and unacceptable conditions, as well as endangering you by knowingly allowing sexual harassment of a minor to go unchecked.
