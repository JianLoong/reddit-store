I\u2019m still a minor so i have limited hours, but i like it a lot. on of my coworkers (we\u2019ll call him ethan) has severe mental disabilities/ issues. he often will leave everyone else to do the work and will say very uncomfortable things. as i mentioned, i am a minor. ethan has multiple times made jokes about me being a minor and asking if i still am one. he shows interest, but i have no want to reciprocate in the slightest. he also tries to push religious things such as bible verses on me and my coworkers. it makes me uncomfortable and i have voiced my uncomfort about the situation to multiple people. most people just shrug it off as ethan being ethan, but he makes me feel just extremely uncomfortable. he is 26, so the age gap is very very large. recently, our schedules haven\u2019t been matching, so i\u2019ve had a break. he switched shifts with ny other coworker last week, and started the same old routine. he will arrive about a half an hour before clocking in and just sit or follow me around the shop without saying anything. or he\u2019ll stare at me until i look because i can feel him staring and he\u2019ll quickly look away. i\u2019ve just started to ignore him. this particular day, we had a lot to do so i wasn\u2019t having any of it. i kept walking to the back where he was and not acknowledging him because i was preoccupied. he started throughout my shift trying to get my attention and i even asked him to please leave me alone because i wasn\u2019t having a good day. eventually i just began ignoring him altogether. i wasn\u2019t being rude, just doing my job and not talking to him like i usually do. he seemed to get really upset and mad and started acting all angry for the rest of the shift. the main problem i have is i know he doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m not interested, but i don\u2019t think i should have to keep putting myself in uncomfortable situations for his benefit. when i say uncomfortable, i mean like a grown man talking to me a 17 year old about his wet dreams. I\u2019m just done with it. Am I the asshole for feeling like this?\ntldr: creepy coworker", "created_utc": 1677484097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d6368/aita_for_not_wanting_to_deal_with_my_mentally_ill/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From what it sounds like you may end up having to call HR about the situation. If you do, keep track of everything the same way. Write down everything. What you are experiencing is harassment. Mental illness or not, it does not give Ethan any right to harass or make you feel uncomfortable. You've repeatedly asked him to stop and he has continued.

Speak to HR and see about getting a schedule change so you two don\u2019t have to interact together. \n\nI have a mental disorder. It\u2019s nowhere near as debilitating as what you\u2019re describing but I know it\u2019s a burden for others when my symptoms get bad. Mostly bc I have to leave the area immediately or I need alone time. A lot of alone time. And quiet. I\u2019m allowed to avoid triggers. I don\u2019t but I know it bothers people. I have strategies to cope without assistance but they don\u2019t always work. I try to work it out so the people around me have to deal with my disorder as little as possible, ideally not at all. Your coworker may not be able to do that but your employer certainly can. It\u2019s a two-way street.", "NTA. NO disability is an excuse or reason for sexual harassment. If he is capable of having a job and going into society without adult supervision, then he is capable of understanding that sexual harassment is not ok and that his behaviour is predatory. You need to talk to your employer about his behaviour and if nothing is done then you have grounds for a lawsuit or to take it to your government employment ministry (depending on country). Report him, speak out and don't stop speaking out til something is done.", "NTA. \n\nYou don't have to jeopardize your own mental health to accommodate someone else's mental issues.

In my experience nothing will happen to the coworker but when your employer has to start answering police questions you get results.", "NTA, and call it what it is: sexual harassment. You asked him to stop, he hasn't,  go talk to a supervisor or HR and document every time he harassed you.", "NTA. Talk to human resources. He's sexually harassing you.", "Nta. Inform your manager of what going on and mention his anger when you avoid him. Record the talk with your manager so if they don't do anything you can send it to hr and the police. A danger to minors is a danger to minors, no matter the disability.", "NTA. There is no disability that would make this kind of behaviour acceptable. If he genuinely can't help it then he needs support services, not a job. You are not using these words but you are describing behaviour that amounts to stalking, intimidation, and sexual harassment. \n\nContact a lawyer (some offer free consultations) about your options.\n\nETA: some people are saying go to HR. No. Contact a lawyer first so that when you go to HR you know your rights and they know you mean business.

Report this to HR, your manager, or your boss immediately and tell your parents. Just because of his mental disabilities / illness, it does not excuse or absolve him from being creepy towards you / sexually harassing you especially after you told him to stop multiple times. Record your conversations or have proof that you asked him to stop and what he has been saying.", "NTA\n\nBeyond that, report this to management ASAP.\n\nIf he doesn't understand boundaries around sexual matters he's potentially a danger to you.", "NTA, go to your boss and explain the issue.", "NTA. If that's \"Ethan just being Ethan\", then he needs to be fired. There is no excuse for this.  It is not your responsibility to put up with his creepy BS, and the company should have shut it down immediately.\n\nWelcome to the world of shitty employers.  I'm sorry you're stuck dealing with this situation so young, but it is an excellent opportunity to practice advocating for yourself and learning the line where employee responsibility ends and employer responsibility begins.\n\n If you're in the U.S., sexual harassment is federally illegal (most states also have laws against it, but even if they don't, the federal law protects you) and your employer has a duty to protect their employees from harassment.  This is a serious and potentially dangerous situation you're in, and they're trying to ignore it.\n\n If the company has an HR department, report it to them.  Otherwise tell your boss. If your boss doesn't do anything, escalate it to THEIR boss.  Make noise.  Be the squeaky wheel.  If your parents are the type to have your back, tell them and let them help advocate for you.  Bosses and landlords get away with a lot of B.S. because employees, especially young employees, don't know their rights and put up with blatantly illegal treatment. (Take it from someone who put up with way too much B.S. in her youth).\n\nDo your reporting via text or email, and save copies of everything.  You want to document not only Ethan's behavior, but the fact that you reported it and what response you received.  \"Lol, that's just Ethan\" is NOT an appropriate response.  If that's their action plan, make them put it in writing.\n\nThey have to make the problem stop right now, and make sure it doesn't happen again. How they do that is their problem, not yours.  Dealing with Ethan is above your pay grade. Make them earn their fat paycheck.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA this shouldn\u2019t need to escalate into even more egregious sexual harassment, it\u2019s already really bad now. TELL YOUR PARENTS AND TEACHERS IMMEDIATELY. \n1st thing- Write down ever date/time you can remember and what this guy has done and said. And any witnesses. He has a track record of being creepy towards a minor. \nThis will make it more obvious to the idiots who think this extremely disturbing and unacceptable behavior is okay. Sorry but you will always have to deal with this type of idiocy. It doesn\u2019t ever go away as a woman unfortunately.", "NTA. But if you want to stay working there and the problem persists or gets out of hand ... maybe you need to carry Mace with you just incase. \n\nYou've already set boundaries, informed others and tried to ignore the person. Don't use it on a whim of course, but definitely have it to protect yourself if Ethan can't behave himself.", "If you're in the US report it to the EEOC, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/what-you-should-know-what-do-if-you-believe-you-have-been-harassed-work", "NTA: I strongly recommend you tell the manager/HR/owner immediately and follow up with an email so you have documentation. This is not ok. The fact that you\u2019re a minor makes it worse, but it\u2019s wrong regardless. If it isn\u2019t resolved you need to contact an employment lawyer. You are being sexually harassed and put in an unsafe situation. THIS IS NOT OK."]}
