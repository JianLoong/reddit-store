{"id": 25343, "submission_id": "15z9sk6", "title": "AITA for no allowing my neighbors to make a copy of my apartment key?", "selftext": "So I recently just moved into my new apartment complex less than 60 days ago. There are only 4 units in my complex, two downstairs and two upstairs. I reside downstairs in the second apartment. Everyone here has lived here for at least 5 years whilst the oldest resident has reside here for 8. Everyone knows everyone and has been good friends with each other for as long as each one has been a resident. \nEveryone in my building has children besides me majority are single mothers, I am the only man.\n\nApparently there is an unspoken agreement I at first had any knowledge of between the rest of the tenants  that the hallway door is to never be locked. No one ever locks the hallway door. That is until I arrived. From my knowledge no one in the building has a hallway key just the keys to their apartments. The cost to replace a key is $70 for each quoted from my landlord. I just finished up my place and have officially moved in for about 3 weeks now. Each time I leave and come back from my complex I always lock the hallway door. It's always been a hit to lock all doors behind me.\n My neighbor that works night shifts has arrived home for the past couple of weeks to a locked hallway door which is a surprise given that the door hasn't been locked for years. Apparently everyone lost their key their first year or so living in the complex. I will hear continuously knocking and banging until someone comes to open the door. The first few nights I was awaken and got up to unlock the door. After the first week I've since stopped and my neighbor will be up to unlock it to let our neighbor in. If my neighbor isn't home or doesn't wake up to come to the door she will knock and bang on every window and yell until someone comes open the door.\n\nYesterday my neighbor ask I I could pleaseleave the door unlocked given it has always been that way and would like me to continue doing so. I expressed that while we live in a dangerous neighborhood ( rated one of the top 5 most dangerous in our city) Is feel more safe knowing strangers can't enter the building. Whilst she understood my concerns she assured me no one ever comes here but residents and invited visitors and my safety is not to worry. I had to beg to differ. She then asks would I mind lending her my hall key so she can make a copy and let other make their own copy from hers. I politely declined because I wasn't comfortable with that. She offered to pay me to make a copy myself in which I also declined.\n\nFor the past week my neighbors has barely spoken to me we usually tell each other good morning and chat a little or just a hi and bye even but not even that nowadays. My neighbor whom volunteers at the food bank in our community would come back with goodies and share with everyone in the complex. She has since knocked on my door to deliver me a box as she usually would every Wednesday. I don't care for the food but for the change in this routine leads me to believe I may have upset the rest of the tenants and I honestly don't want any bad blood.", "created_utc": 1692810196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z9sk6/aita_for_no_allowing_my_neighbors_to_make_a_copy/", "score": 1308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. Yeah you caused bad blood. You declined every solution proposed. Just get the key copied and have them pay you.

She made a reasonable request so that she and the others could accommodate your wishes and you said no. Yes, they have a preference to leave the door unlocked, but they will lock it for you as long as they can also return to their homes. \n\nThey have already agreed to allow your comfort zone of having the door locked. Why on Earth would you be uncomfortable about letting them have keys to the door that you share? You have said that they could get new ones from the landlord but they would be $70 a piece.

You are following the rules and they aren\u2019t. They should not have lost their keys and when they did, they should have replaced them instead of compromising the security of everyone living in the building.\n\nBut $70 is a lot of money for some people. And if these are all single moms, then they are single income families and they just might not have $70 to spare.\n\nYou are upsetting all of your neighbors to prove a point. And your sleep gets disturbed frequently by people who are just trying to get get into their homes and go to sleep.\n\nAnd your taking a stand on the matter isn\u2019t working. \n\nHave a tiny bit of compassion. Take your key and find out how much it costs to get it copied. Landlords frequently inflate the cost of replacement keys so that people will keep track of them and not bother the landlord for copies.\n\nIf it is a regular key, just get copies made and inform your neighbors they can have the keys if they pay for them. Feel free to add a bit to the cost to cover your time and effort in getting the keys made.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nIf the keys cannot be copied or are super expensive, suggest to one of the other tenants that the cheapest way for them all to get keys is for someone to figure out a way to get the landlord to replace the lock in the hallway door.

If yours says do not duplicate then I doubt it can be in any legal way. \n\nMakes you wonder though, why didn\u2019t they duplicate before.

Either let them copy the hallway key you have or stop locking the door. This ain't rocket science homie.

There are three lost keys to the building out there, so just making new copies leave at least three keys out there unaccounted for.

There are only 4 units in my complex, two downstairs and two upstairs. I reside downstairs in the second apartment. Everyone here has lived here for at least 5 years whilst the oldest resident has reside here for 8. Everyone knows everyone and has been good friends with each other for as long as each one has been a resident. \nEveryone in my building has children besides me majority are single mothers, I am the only man.\n\nApparently there is an unspoken agreement I at first had any knowledge of between the rest of the tenants  that the hallway door is to never be locked. No one ever locks the hallway door. That is until I arrived. From my knowledge no one in the building has a hallway key just the keys to their apartments. The cost to replace a key is $70 for each quoted from my landlord. I just finished up my place and have officially moved in for about 3 weeks now. Each time I leave and come back from my complex I always lock the hallway door. It's always been a hit to lock all doors behind me.\n My neighbor that works night shifts has arrived home for the past couple of weeks to a locked hallway door which is a surprise given that the door hasn't been locked for years. Apparently everyone lost their key their first year or so living in the complex. I will hear continuously knocking and banging until someone comes to open the door. The first few nights I was awaken and got up to unlock the door. After the first week I've since stopped and my neighbor will be up to unlock it to let our neighbor in. If my neighbor isn't home or doesn't wake up to come to the door she will knock and bang on every window and yell until someone comes open the door.\n\nYesterday my neighbor ask I I could pleaseleave the door unlocked given it has always been that way and would like me to continue doing so. I expressed that while we live in a dangerous neighborhood ( rated one of the top 5 most dangerous in our city) Is feel more safe knowing strangers can't enter the building. Whilst she understood my concerns she assured me no one ever comes here but residents and invited visitors and my safety is not to worry. I had to beg to differ. She then asks would I mind lending her my hall key so she can make a copy and let other make their own copy from hers. I politely declined because I wasn't comfortable with that. She offered to pay me to make a copy myself in which I also declined.\n\nFor the past week my neighbors has barely spoken to me we usually tell each other good morning and chat a little or just a hi and bye even but not even that nowadays. My neighbor whom volunteers at the food bank in our community would come back with goodies and share with everyone in the complex. She has since knocked on my door to deliver me a box as she usually would every Wednesday. I don't care for the food but for the change in this routine leads me to believe I may have upset the rest of the tenants and I honestly don't want any bad blood.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Regardless of the key situation, why is someone who volunteers at a food bank coming home with sufficient food to share around the neighbours?", "I think this was a Seinfeld episode.", "Yeah you might be TAH , but so are the  neighbors.

Understandable why you don't want to leave the hallway door unlocked, but just let her make a copy of the key. It'll cost you nothing but a minor inconvenience for a couple hours", "YTA simply because you are not offering a solution. What do you expect your neighbors to do, continue being locked out because of your rude behavior?", "YTA\n\nI don't understand your smug attitude about not letting your neighbors copy the key or not copying the key for them if  they pay you.\n\nI can understand why you might want the exterior door locked and it appears that your neighbors are willing to go along with that.\n\nHowever, I would like to know your rationale for not doing the very simple favor of either lending your key or copying one. Obviously there is no security risk which would be the only rational issue in terms of lending a key.\n\nI don't know why a key costs $70 but my experience is that often landlords charge a premium for a replacement key because they want to discourage people from lending their keys out to non-residents. For example, in my building there each unit gets two security keys and there is a significant cost if you need a replacement. This is so people don't give their security keys out to random people including cleaning help which would make the building less safe for other residents.", "YTA i agree on wanting to be safe and leaving the building vulnerable but that having been said why not make a gift of front hall keys to each apartment-they lost theirs you can take yours, have copies made so they're not out $70 each and they can now lock the doors.\n\ndo you have to? no\n\nbut since you're worried about the vibe of the building this seems to be a good compromise", "If you live in a bad neighborhood, the door should definitely be locked.

On one hand, I understand concern. Dangerous city, you want to keep yourself and your property safe. It\u2019s not your fault they lost their keys.

It\u2019s thrown into a junk drawer with some other unused keys. Maybe it\u2019s still there and they don\u2019t know. Maybe they did a spring cleaning one year and threw out all the old keys they don\u2019t use.", "Yeah no shit, it's a bad neighborhood. You know, where slumlords exploit people. Why on earth does anyone think this is a high security key? I can promise landlord gives no fucks so long as rent is paid and no one complains too much.", "Also, if it is supposed to be locked, it should be spring loaded at the top to automatically close and automatically lock. They have locks in knobs that always open from the inside when locked, but locked from the outside when locked.", "I dont' get how all of them managed to immediately lose the key that they need to get into their place of residence...but didn't lose the key to their apartment door.\n\nHow are these keys not kept, you know...together?  Like on some kind of key organizer, a key folio or something.  what would you even call such a magical thing?", "We do have doors that will only lock from the outside but will open from the inside but I don't think they're as common as they used to be. I think too many people would go outside, not realize the door was locked, and then be locked out.", "But how can OP then lock the door? I would assume that he locks the door with his key? If the door falls close automatically then the other tenants would already have the problem with the shut door.", "The machine in Walmart will copy it regardless.", "Its not HIS fault THEY lost THEIR keys. Get that shit from the landlord. Its not his responsibility.", "He\u2019s utilizing the security features he\u2019s paying for, he\u2019s not harming anyone else except insofar as they were previously negligent. \n\nSuppose they had an alarm system that was always beeping and the previous tenants had gotten used to it, and now they complained that he turned off the beeping and it\u2019s disruptive. It\u2019s the same thing, he\u2019s doing things right and they\u2019re awful people who can\u2019t be bothered.", "Yup. Every renting situation I've been in had that as a clause.", "Heck, usually the keys themselves say not to copy them.", "Except they also offered to give him the money so that he could go and get the key copied...", "They have also offered to give *him* the money it would cost to get the key copied. So your \"what if\" isn't really valid.", "If it's someone he recognizes, then yes. But if he doesn't recognize them, it's a bit fishy. It's like that Seinfeld episode where Jerry locks out a guy he doesn't know (and then finds out the guy does indeed live there).", "He did not lock them out. They locked themselves out by not getting keys.", "One of the tenants offered to pay him and have him get the copy cut and he still said no.", "None of the leases I've signed in England had that kind of clause", "So your logic is that because they have unexpected bills involving children, they should magically have money for unexpected bills involving lost keys and inflated landlord \"nuisance fees\"? Huh.", "Yes, it deeply sucks that the keys are lost. That doesn't make $70 magically appear in the bank though.", "\"Most people can't afford $70 to replace a key\" does not magically make these women $70 richer. Do you want to solve the problem wherein Op is routinely awoken at night by people banging on the door he locked, or don't you? \n\nBecause honestly I'm fine with Op never sleeping well again if that's his choice, but he seems unhappy with the situation.", "A random person could literally just wait in the hallway out of sight until one of tenents walk in and pull a gun/rob them or anything.  Its still not safe", "They didn't live there alone, they were still 3 others. Maybe those other's left because the first person stopped locking the door. Then they forced that on all new comers. Yeah, plenty of AH outside OP in that narrative.", "Yeah I feel like there's a lot of good faith being extended to a nebulous landlord entity here that is almost assuredly not deserved", "I'm betting they never got the keys to start with. Had a landlord like that.", "Is it possible they were never even given the keys in the first place? Seems weird that every single person there would lose that one specific key.\n\nWhen I first moved into the complex I'm living in now, I was supposed to get a key to the laundry room and never did. They leave it unlocked all hours, though, so it hasn't been an issue.", "The way he describes the context it sounded to me like he does know the other three occupants of the building, at least by sight, and is choosing not to help them out of a situation he has helped create. But I might be biased because I think he's an asshole.", "Some keys are not physically able to be copied. Your local hardware store wouldn't have the blanks/equipment to make the copies.", "That doesn't change my other point, usually ***tenants aren't allowed to copy their keys***.  The neighbors need to talk to the landlord, not OP.  Though they probably don't want to because if I was a landlord I would be furious at my tenants for not only losing their keys, but also leaving a hallway door unlocked that was supposed to be locked (I'm guessing since OP was given a key).  Because those are hallways are usually locked for safety and insurance purposes.", "Is the OP in England? If so, that recontextualizes the situation significantly.\n\nImpression I got was that they're in the US, and here, it's pretty damn rare not to at least need to get landlord permission for each instance of copying a key. Some places, it's just not allowed at all; you want another key, you get it directly from the landlord, and the keys all say \"no copying\" right on the key. Other places, I've been able to just go to the landlord or their representative (apt manager or maintenance guy), say I wanna make a copy of key X for reason Y, they OK it, and then it's fine, but even then, if I skipped asking and just copied it, and they found out, I'd be very lucky not to at least be evicted, and there's a decent chance I'd also find myself in court as a defendant.", "Perhaps it became common practice for them to leave the hallway door unlocked so that they didn't have to deal with unlocking that one on the way in and then all ended up losing their key because it wasn't one they used.\n\nThey were willing to compromise and accept the door being locked and paying for OP to get the key copied... they sound like the reasonable adults to me here", "Not safe but slightly safer, you\u2019re right in front of your own door if you\u2019re being chased home, and neighbours are more likely to hear any altercation", "well, OP guy was given a key, seems odd that nobody else would be.  He said they told him they all lost their keys.", "They all probably have them in their flats somewhere. \n\nThey just cba to find them", "Single moms with kids. Kids lose stuff. At different times, kids probably came home and over the 5 to 8 years, keys got misplaced and lost.", "Honestly, so long as the cart isn't blocking the space, I don't mind people doing this. When I take over their space, I also get to take their cart. Win/win.", "In this analogy, \"locking the cart\" means \"causing the least amount of inconvenience to others\". Locking the door now inconveniences 5 other tenants, leaving it unlocked inconvenienced 0.", "Nah what OP is doing is taking the cart to the corral, but leaving it beside the corral so he can feel superior but still inconvenience someone by not taking steps to help his neighbors.", "Deciding \"I'm just not going to lock the door\" is not a \"solution\" for losing your keys. It's literally the exact opposite of a solution.", "Its *always* a bad idea to end-run around your contracts. The other tenants had keys and lost them. The only solution now is for them to adhere to their contract and order new keys. NTA.\n\nContract > status quo.", "If my landlord had ever found out I allowed people to make copies of a key to access our apartment building it would have been *a big problem*. \n\nI'm not aware of any landlords that are cool with copies of keys being made.", "Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I would allow the copies so that the landlord wouldn\u2019t get to price-gouge my neighbors for a replacement key.", "\"No good reason\"\n\nMf they lost their own key", "It is his key. He has the right to decide whether he gives it out or not. Those women all lost their keys. They played themselves and must suffer the natural consequences of stumping up the cash to replace them.\n\nAnything else said, is just gaslighting and guilt tripping.", "No I'm pretty sure you're right about that, just being fair in pointing out the slight alternative possibility.", "Wanting to be safe is fine just in case of anything", "So I agree that he kind of sucks for not just making a copy, but he did not make the situation shitty. The other neighbors made it shitty by losing all of their keys without ever making a copy or having the lock changed. Leaving that door unlocked is a dumb fucking \u201csolution\u201d", "I think this is too far. They are not reasonable adults if they are too lazy to lock the exterior door to their building in a bad neighborhood when their children are sleeping. ESH", ">\"demand: an insistent and peremptory request, made as if by right.\"\n\nPerhaps I took liberties with the wording but I stand by what I said. The were also AHs.", "Why replace a key to a door that no one locks or wants locked?", "they never needed it because they had an agreement not to lock that door", "Who gives a shit where their keys are? Totally irrelevant.\n\nOP has created a problem where there was not one before, and refuses to participate in correcting it at no cost to himself.\n\nThat's about as dick as moves come.", "I think it's easy to understand the other tenants' side: you have a key to a door that nobody locks, ever. You only use your house keys, so you put that key in a drawer and months go by. Soon enough you don't even remember where you put it. I think OP is already strange to start locking the door, but alright... his right I guess. Then he doesn't even want to help the other tenants make copies of the keys.\n\nOP most defines YTA", "Most times they leave a cart somewhere, it's blocking the space unfortunately.", "If you live in a locked apartment building, leaving the door slightly ajar would be more convenient (but also let strangers in). That doesn't make it the right thing to do. OP is paying for a secure, locked complex.", "I agree with you. If it is a high crime area as OP says, leaving the door to an apartment building unlocked is irresponsible. Doesn't even matter if an intruder can't get into the individual apartments; I'd be really uncomfortable entering an unlocked building knowing someone could be lurking in there.\n\nOP is NTA.", "With the main door unlocked they still had access to their apartments. With the main door locked, they are out on the street in a bad area. What's not to get?", "People? Or the other residents of the same building? They aren't the same.", "years and years ago and they just want to make copies so they can get into their apartments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is TA easy", "If OP is in the US, that language is boilerplate on all lease agreements. Would be good info to know for sure though, as I would feel more harshly towards OP without it.", "Theyre still not really safe because theres at least 3 missing keys to the door.  The smart thing would be to let the landlord know so they can change out the lock and give everybody new keys. It won't happen though because its going to cost more than 70 bucks", "With the main door unlocked it compromised the security of the building and the apartments.  Whats not to get?", "*Anyone*. Have you not rented?", "I had to get special permission to make extra copies of my apartment keys, and had to insure them it was for my own use...", "Unless they manage to \"lose\" his key as well...\n\nHow they all managed to lose their hallway key is highly suspicious.  And depending on the situation (like when I lived in an apartment) you can simply go and get copies made of keys like that.  The keys themselves can usually run more expensive, but also many are stamped with a \"do not copy.\"  Meaning it can only be copied with permission.", "Do you know this for a fact, or are you just making assumptions.", "Imagine being pissed at your neighbor because you couldnt be responsible enough to not lose your key and too finicially illiterate to save up 70 over the last few years once you realized the key was missing.  What a world you live in"]}
