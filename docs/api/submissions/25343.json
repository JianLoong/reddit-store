{"id": 25343, "submission_id": "15z9sk6", "title": "AITA for no allowing my neighbors to make a copy of my apartment key?", "selftext": "So I recently just moved into my new apartment complex less than 60 days ago. There are only 4 units in my complex, two downstairs and two upstairs. I reside downstairs in the second apartment. Everyone here has lived here for at least 5 years whilst the oldest resident has reside here for 8. Everyone knows everyone and has been good friends with each other for as long as each one has been a resident. \nEveryone in my building has children besides me majority are single mothers, I am the only man.\n\nApparently there is an unspoken agreement I at first had any knowledge of between the rest of the tenants  that the hallway door is to never be locked. No one ever locks the hallway door. That is until I arrived. From my knowledge no one in the building has a hallway key just the keys to their apartments. The cost to replace a key is $70 for each quoted from my landlord. I just finished up my place and have officially moved in for about 3 weeks now. Each time I leave and come back from my complex I always lock the hallway door. It's always been a hit to lock all doors behind me.\n My neighbor that works night shifts has arrived home for the past couple of weeks to a locked hallway door which is a surprise given that the door hasn't been locked for years. Apparently everyone lost their key their first year or so living in the complex. I will hear continuously knocking and banging until someone comes to open the door. The first few nights I was awaken and got up to unlock the door. After the first week I've since stopped and my neighbor will be up to unlock it to let our neighbor in. If my neighbor isn't home or doesn't wake up to come to the door she will knock and bang on every window and yell until someone comes open the door.\n\nYesterday my neighbor ask I I could pleaseleave the door unlocked given it has always been that way and would like me to continue doing so. I expressed that while we live in a dangerous neighborhood ( rated one of the top 5 most dangerous in our city) Is feel more safe knowing strangers can't enter the building. Whilst she understood my concerns she assured me no one ever comes here but residents and invited visitors and my safety is not to worry. I had to beg to differ. She then asks would I mind lending her my hall key so she can make a copy and let other make their own copy from hers. I politely declined because I wasn't comfortable with that. She offered to pay me to make a copy myself in which I also declined.\n\nFor the past week my neighbors has barely spoken to me we usually tell each other good morning and chat a little or just a hi and bye even but not even that nowadays. My neighbor whom volunteers at the food bank in our community would come back with goodies and share with everyone in the complex. She has since knocked on my door to deliver me a box as she usually would every Wednesday. I don't care for the food but for the change in this routine leads me to believe I may have upset the rest of the tenants and I honestly don't want any bad blood.", "created_utc": 1692810196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z9sk6/aita_for_no_allowing_my_neighbors_to_make_a_copy/", "score": 269, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, they have a preference to leave the door unlocked, but they will lock it for you as long as they can also return to their homes. \n\nThey have already agreed to allow your comfort zone of having the door locked. Why on Earth would you be uncomfortable about letting them have keys to the door that you share? You have said that they could get new ones from the landlord but they would be $70 a piece.

You are following the rules and they aren\u2019t. They should not have lost their keys and when they did, they should have replaced them instead of compromising the security of everyone living in the building.\n\nBut $70 is a lot of money for some people. And if these are all single moms, then they are single income families and they just might not have $70 to spare.\n\nYou are upsetting all of your neighbors to prove a point. And your sleep gets disturbed frequently by people who are just trying to get get into their homes and go to sleep.\n\nAnd your taking a stand on the matter isn\u2019t working. \n\nHave a tiny bit of compassion. Take your key and find out how much it costs to get it copied. Landlords frequently inflate the cost of replacement keys so that people will keep track of them and not bother the landlord for copies.\n\nIf it is a regular key, just get copies made and inform your neighbors they can have the keys if they pay for them. Feel free to add a bit to the cost to cover your time and effort in getting the keys made.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nIf the keys cannot be copied or are super expensive, suggest to one of the other tenants that the cheapest way for them all to get keys is for someone to figure out a way to get the landlord to replace the lock in the hallway door.

Either let them copy the hallway key you have or stop locking the door. This ain't rocket science homie.

You pay to live in a building that has that added level of security. There are three lost keys to the building out there, so just making new copies leave at least three keys out there unaccounted for.

There are only 4 units in my complex, two downstairs and two upstairs. I reside downstairs in the second apartment. Everyone here has lived here for at least 5 years whilst the oldest resident has reside here for 8. Everyone knows everyone and has been good friends with each other for as long as each one has been a resident. \nEveryone in my building has children besides me majority are single mothers, I am the only man.\n\nApparently there is an unspoken agreement I at first had any knowledge of between the rest of the tenants  that the hallway door is to never be locked. No one ever locks the hallway door. That is until I arrived. From my knowledge no one in the building has a hallway key just the keys to their apartments. The cost to replace a key is $70 for each quoted from my landlord. I just finished up my place and have officially moved in for about 3 weeks now. Each time I leave and come back from my complex I always lock the hallway door. It's always been a hit to lock all doors behind me.\n My neighbor that works night shifts has arrived home for the past couple of weeks to a locked hallway door which is a surprise given that the door hasn't been locked for years. Apparently everyone lost their key their first year or so living in the complex. I will hear continuously knocking and banging until someone comes to open the door. The first few nights I was awaken and got up to unlock the door. After the first week I've since stopped and my neighbor will be up to unlock it to let our neighbor in. If my neighbor isn't home or doesn't wake up to come to the door she will knock and bang on every window and yell until someone comes open the door.\n\nYesterday my neighbor ask I I could pleaseleave the door unlocked given it has always been that way and would like me to continue doing so. I expressed that while we live in a dangerous neighborhood ( rated one of the top 5 most dangerous in our city) Is feel more safe knowing strangers can't enter the building. Whilst she understood my concerns she assured me no one ever comes here but residents and invited visitors and my safety is not to worry. I had to beg to differ. She then asks would I mind lending her my hall key so she can make a copy and let other make their own copy from hers. I politely declined because I wasn't comfortable with that. She offered to pay me to make a copy myself in which I also declined.\n\nFor the past week my neighbors has barely spoken to me we usually tell each other good morning and chat a little or just a hi and bye even but not even that nowadays. My neighbor whom volunteers at the food bank in our community would come back with goodies and share with everyone in the complex. She has since knocked on my door to deliver me a box as she usually would every Wednesday. I don't care for the food but for the change in this routine leads me to believe I may have upset the rest of the tenants and I honestly don't want any bad blood.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Regardless of the key situation, why is someone who volunteers at a food bank coming home with sufficient food to share around the neighbours?", "I think this was a Seinfeld episode.", "Yeah you might be TAH , but so are the  neighbors.

Understandable why you don't want to leave the hallway door unlocked, but just let her make a copy of the key. It'll cost you nothing but a minor inconvenience for a couple hours", "YTA simply because you are not offering a solution. What do you expect your neighbors to do, continue being locked out because of your rude behavior?", "YTA\n\nI don't understand your smug attitude about not letting your neighbors copy the key or not copying the key for them if  they pay you.\n\nI can understand why you might want the exterior door locked and it appears that your neighbors are willing to go along with that.\n\nHowever, I would like to know your rationale for not doing the very simple favor of either lending your key or copying one. Obviously there is no security risk which would be the only rational issue in terms of lending a key.\n\nI don't know why a key costs $70 but my experience is that often landlords charge a premium for a replacement key because they want to discourage people from lending their keys out to non-residents. For example, in my building there each unit gets two security keys and there is a significant cost if you need a replacement. This is so people don't give their security keys out to random people including cleaning help which would make the building less safe for other residents.", "YTA i agree on wanting to be safe and leaving the building vulnerable but that having been said why not make a gift of front hall keys to each apartment-they lost theirs you can take yours, have copies made so they're not out $70 each and they can now lock the doors.\n\ndo you have to? no\n\nbut since you're worried about the vibe of the building this seems to be a good compromise", "If you live in a bad neighborhood, the door should definitely be locked.

On one hand, I understand concern. Dangerous city, you want to keep yourself and your property safe. It\u2019s not your fault they lost their keys.
