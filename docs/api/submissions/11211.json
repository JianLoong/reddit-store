He has ADHD and I'm sure that plays a role but I will say that it mostly comes down to things like chores. When it comes to leisure activities, he doesn't procrastinate at all and usually rushes me. \n\nSo basically he will say things like \"I will do the dishes when I get back from the store\" and then never do them because he forgets. Or if trash needs to be taken out, he will say \"wake me up in the morning when you get the kids on the bus and I will do it then\" but then never does. If the house needs cleaning and I start getting to work, he will try to convince me to wait a few hours so he can \"help\" but if I do wait, it never gets done. And it truly is him forgetting. It's not deliberate by any means. Even if he is the one cooking dinner that night he will usually forget that he's cooking and randomly say \"Oh shit\" and run out of the room at a buck 10 so he doesn't burn the food because he truly forgot he was cooking at all (I always remember and am super aware of everything so obviously I would never let it get to a point of disaster- BUT I do make a point to not say anything unless I absolutely have to). \n\nAnyways, this is how it's always been. I'm so used to it at this point that it doesn't really bother me. I actually enjoy cleaning but some days the help would be nice and he does help when he actually remembers. He's not useless by any means and he does absolutely try to take the load off my hands. He truly just forgets often. But I will say that lately I've been frustrated. I'm 20 weeks pregnant. Getting a little slow on movement and increasingly tired and dare I say lazy myself. I still do my part but I admittedly do not want to. Hormones and fatigue are a bitch. But anyways, I got in a deep clean mode like two days ago and started going ham on this house. My husband said he wanted to help me but had an appointment to detail a vehicle first. So he leaves. The appointment should have only been an hour but he came back in roughly two and a half. Turns out he knew the guy from school and they were catching up. By the time he got home, the house was sparkling clean. He says something like \"Shit, I should have came home sooner. I got caught up and forgot.\" So I said \"That sounds like a you problem\". He asked what I meant and I said \"You forgetting everything is a you problem. I've dealt with it for years and I no longer want to hear it used as an excuse.\" I was frustrated. My back was killing me and I just wanted to sit and enjoy my book in peace without being disturbed. He shook his head and said \"That was uncalled for\" and walked off.

In a sense, you're enabling his failure to do something about them.\n\nWith an infant/child soon to be joining your family, it's past time for him to do something, even if it's to learn memory management tricks. Otherwise, he can't be trusted to be alone with the new baby. Deal with this before something really bad happens.", "NTA.  What you said was true and long over due.  Your husband's ADHD is *his* problem and *he* needs to work with his doctor to find a way to manage it so that he can be a true partner to you and a father to your soon to be child.", "NTA.  I live with someone exactly like this and it is maddening.  He was medicated for ADHD for about a year and the change was remarkable.  He is off the meds now and its back to this same scenario.  He is also a huge baby and cannot take even a whiff of criticism", "NTA borderline NAH. He really does sound like a good husband and father. But you both need to recognize this is a problem that won't improve without professional help. You're incredibly patient but it's not fair that remembering his responsibilities has become your job.", "NTA, but I have ADHD and it is so hard for me to remember anything and chores often fall by the wayside, due to executive dysfunction. But he needs to figure out himself how to deal\u2026 like set alarms. Say \u201cI will do 25 cleaning up acts this morning\u201d. I actually had my husband change the wifi password so I didn\u2019t get sidetracked before I was done.", "NTA. It\u2019s only going to get worse once the baby is born. Hope you have a very large support system because you\u2019re going to need it.", "Look up Executive Function with ADHD.\n\nThings like chores; dishes, showering, cleaning, laundry, etc., can be quite challenging for someone with ADHD. They may need reminders or find ways to cope with it.\n\nIt's totally normal to be frustrated with it, so you guys need to communicate and he needs to figure out ways to do better and make more of an effort to not be so forgetful, like setting an alarm, etc.", "INFO is his ADHD medicated because if not then if there is no medical reason for not doing it, he should look into it. Also, why does he not set up notifications for things, I have notifications for everything on my phone because I forget things.", "NAH the ADHD memory fog is *brutal*. You look up and it'd been 6hrs and you didn't do anything you planned and you couldn't say what you *did* the entire time. Like some one is just stealing time from you. It's probably affecting his ability to do fun things more than you realize, because it can *look* like we are doing something fun but we are trapped in a loop and dont know how to break it.\n\nHowever, that being said he needs to start looking into different treatment and management options because the ones he has clearly aren't working- especially if he's goig to be a dad he needs to be involved. If you can find a therapist who specialize I'd ADHD that would be great, because they can help set up structure and habbits. If he isn't taking medication it also might be worth looking into, if he is then possibly its time to adjust type or dosage, as your chemistry can change over time and need adjustment.", "I'm very much like your husband (the rushing to the kitchen part actually touched me), so i identify. It was harsh, but certainly not uncalled for. However, it doesn't address the issue that you're about to have a child and your husband needs to understand this has to change.

He'll backslide eventually. Sorry....", "NTA, that WAS called for- it\u2019s a problem that has made your life worse for years.", "NAH, the comment was a bit snappy, but I doubt he doesn't understand why or think you are an asshole about it. Is your husband using some techniques to try to and remember important things, do them immediately so he doesn't forget, set up alarm for when something is happening or for example - stay in the kitchen when he is cooking so as not to forget the thing in the oven?

There are many adults with ADHD and all have had to learn ways to workaround their issue so they can function.  Frankly, I'm amazed he's able to remain employed if he's that bad with his ADHD.  \n\nMaybe he could have his phone pop up repeated notifications for important things like \"Help pregnant wife clean house\", if he'd listen to them.  \n\nMaybe he needs to see a psychiatrist to be on medication for them.

It is up to him to do whatever he needs to do about his forgettfulness.  He can get on medication.  He can set up alerts in his phone.  He can have a big white board in the kitchen with his duties.

He needs to do his part too.", "NTA - he is using his ADHD to excuse laziness and weaponize incompetence.

He does the things that I don't necessarily like to do and then I do the other stuff and we clean at the same time and get done at the same time.

I am understanding, but I don\u2019t think he grasps they physical and emotional stress it puts on me to always be on all the time and be the responsible one.  It\u2019s frustrating to not have a reliable spouse even with good intentions.  You have been understanding and accommodating for a long time and I think subconsciously he knows that if he forgets you will take care of it, but you do t have anyone to support you if you forget.", "Definitely NTA, good move. He wants you to both do all the work, and also take time to absolve him of the guilt he is feeling for not helping you.

Or have you provided enough support that he's managed to get away without it all along? \n\nEither way, I'd be very clear with him that you love him, but you don't like the fact that he doesn't seem at all interested in working on the behaviors that are the hardest for you. \n\nI wouldn't want to parent with him, for example. He's not suddenly going to have a new brain when the baby's born. So, unless you see some meaningful efforts to change, I'd strongly consider at least living separately.
