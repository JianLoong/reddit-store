He has ADHD and I'm sure that plays a role but I will say that it mostly comes down to things like chores. When it comes to leisure activities, he doesn't procrastinate at all and usually rushes me. \n\nSo basically he will say things like \"I will do the dishes when I get back from the store\" and then never do them because he forgets. Or if trash needs to be taken out, he will say \"wake me up in the morning when you get the kids on the bus and I will do it then\" but then never does. If the house needs cleaning and I start getting to work, he will try to convince me to wait a few hours so he can \"help\" but if I do wait, it never gets done. And it truly is him forgetting. It's not deliberate by any means. Even if he is the one cooking dinner that night he will usually forget that he's cooking and randomly say \"Oh shit\" and run out of the room at a buck 10 so he doesn't burn the food because he truly forgot he was cooking at all (I always remember and am super aware of everything so obviously I would never let it get to a point of disaster- BUT I do make a point to not say anything unless I absolutely have to). \n\nAnyways, this is how it's always been. I'm so used to it at this point that it doesn't really bother me. I actually enjoy cleaning but some days the help would be nice and he does help when he actually remembers. He's not useless by any means and he does absolutely try to take the load off my hands. He truly just forgets often. But I will say that lately I've been frustrated. I'm 20 weeks pregnant. Getting a little slow on movement and increasingly tired and dare I say lazy myself. I still do my part but I admittedly do not want to. Hormones and fatigue are a bitch. But anyways, I got in a deep clean mode like two days ago and started going ham on this house. My husband said he wanted to help me but had an appointment to detail a vehicle first. So he leaves. The appointment should have only been an hour but he came back in roughly two and a half. Turns out he knew the guy from school and they were catching up. By the time he got home, the house was sparkling clean. He says something like \"Shit, I should have came home sooner. I got caught up and forgot.\" So I said \"That sounds like a you problem\". He asked what I meant and I said \"You forgetting everything is a you problem. I've dealt with it for years and I no longer want to hear it used as an excuse.\" I was frustrated. My back was killing me and I just wanted to sit and enjoy my book in peace without being disturbed. He shook his head and said \"That was uncalled for\" and walked off.

You look up and it'd been 6hrs and you didn't do anything you planned and you couldn't say what you *did* the entire time. Like some one is just stealing time from you.

I literally have 2 late bills on my desk at home that I haven't paid because they're stressing me out to the point I can't force myself to sit down and just them.

But on those occasions, I apologize and identify ways to avoid making the same mistake (I now check my calendar for the rest of the day and action any reminders before deciding on a phone-free afternoon).", "She even said he's tried being medicated and had a bad psychical reaction to it, unclear why you think he ISNT trying just because he isn't magically neurotypical", "If he's ever interested in trying medication again, I would suggest trying pharmacogenetic testing-- I discovered that every antidepressant I tried was less than effective and muted my emotions entirely, but when I found the right medication through a genetic test, I realized those side effects were because my body just wasn't processing it properly and I finally found a medication that allowed me to feel a full spectrum of emotions. (I was also doing therapy, which is a good thing because I then had to learn how to handle the fact that I could feel things again lol)\n\nIt sounds like your spouse is really benefiting from therapy though, so it might not be an option you even need to explore, just putting it out there!", "How many different medications did he try? It might just have been the wrong kind...", "It depends on what you take. Some natural supplements have been studied. There are techniques for coping strategies with ADHD you can learn in a book or learning program if you look for one that's legit. Yes some (maybe even most) are bullshit, but not all. I've seen psychiatrists say that if stimulants aren't available to you for some reason, rhodiola could help. No doctor is going to recommend it right off the bat because stimulants are *more* effective and well-regulated. The point is that it's his responsibility to find techniques that help him function. There are tons of people with ADHD and they find systems and solutions.", "bc they're suggesting shit that doesn't work. just repeating what ppl tell literally every disabled person regardless of disability", "I don't have ADHD but I have another disorder where both the disorder and the meds that treat some of the symptoms can lead to non-existant dopamine and executive disfunction, which removes motivation and the ability to feel pleasure from anything at all. When I'm like this, even if I can remember what I need to do and it's sitting right in front of me, I literally cannot get my body to actually do it. If I somehow can make the motions, I still can't figure out how exactly to get it done even if it should be easy to do so. It's gotten so bad that I've been temporarily puzzled by a sink before, trying to wash my hands. People seriously underestimate just how reward driven the human brain is, if the reward isn't there then sometimes you literally cannot do it. Sometimes you literally cannot get your mind to move the way it needs to move for you to figure out or remember how to do it. Normal people seem completely unable to comprehend the difference between disability and laziness when it comes to mental stuff, they can understand why a person in a wheelchair can't run up the stairs but not why someone without dopamine and executive dysfunction doesn't have a pristine well organized home.", "/u/Puzzlehfgj is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.

I then mark it on calendar and set up multiple alarms for the next day before going to bed each night. I have an alarm just to remind me that day what the appointment or chore is so I don\u2019t decide to jump in my car and travel to the closest city for messages and miss things(I live in a small town) as it takes hours there and back. Then I have an alarm set just before I\u2019d need to get ready to go to the appointment or whatever and another alarm five minutes before the appointment starts. It\u2019s not the first time I remembered all day then totally forgot 30 mins before and it was that evening before I realised I missed it.\n\n   \n  You have no idea how much planing and thought I have to put into every single day yet I do it. Not only that but I was still the one that had to organise my late husband and have my kids stuff organised and ready always as he got distracted. Like your situation it was clear he only got distracted on things he didn\u2019t care about and it was selfish, he was a parent to, he lived in our home to. Now it is fully on me to help my kids with paperwork or anything they need and no matter my issues I take responsibility for myself. I am the mum and I\u2019m responsible for the home I live in and as the parent I\u2019m responsible to help and teach them how to do things to be able to eventually live on their own. I have whole points in my life missing from my memory and yet I still manage everything and if I can then he sure as heck could if he wanted to. Seems like although he has memory troubles he is quite happy getting out of all the menial tasks he hates. After all he\u2019s had you there all these years letting him us this excuse and taking it all on yourself. Funny how he can remember to do everything he needs to at his work and he\u2019s not fired for FORGETTING all the paperwork side of the job constantly. Which means he is capable and can do these things.   \nCan I ask how can you trust your husband with the baby on his own after it\u2019s here. I mean that as my husband would say he only looked at something for a minute when in fact it was hours and if he was interested in his book, computer, phone everything else was shut out. On days I worked I\u2019d come home to find the kids hadn\u2019t had lunch by dinner time. He hadn\u2019t brushed their teeth although he did his own. Even that my young toddler had gone out the front door and wondered in our neighbourhood for an hour sitting in the middle of a road before neighbours noticed, Husband still was totally unaware one of them was missing or probably that he had kids. I only worked two days a week at that point, on days he was home. Loads of other story\u2019s and he always claimed to be distracted for a minute when there was no way what happened happened in a minute. That he forgot to feed them and meant to but got distracted again, same with most things. Funny that when I told him If he couldn\u2019t watch his own kids I\u2019d have to quit wether we could afford it or not, as well as threatening to leave if he ever endangered them again, suddenly he could feed them lunch and actually watch them. He loved and chose to have the kids but found having them extremely hard as he couldn\u2019t do what he wanted constantly and had to take responsibility for them. \n\nPlease talk to your husband and make things clear that things have to change in the home.

I feel like a big thing that ADHD does that no one really talks about, is how much it really affects your ability to communicate. Mostly on how you communicate. I understand your frustration too.

That means our brains are always in an emergency, cause we lack dopamine. We\u2019re always in search for a dopamine fix. That\u2019s why your husband is a procrastinator with certain stuff and with others it\u2019s the opposite. Cause those other things give a fast dopamine fix. That\u2019s by the way also why people with ADHD have a bigger risk of becoming drug addicts, are more prone to cheat in relationships and much more. Believe me when i say, that ADHD is an extremely frustrating thing that holds you back a lot in life. There\u2019s a reason why people with ADHD have a 5x times higher suicide rate than people without.\n\nIt\u2019s totally okay that you\u2019re frustrated and annoyed by the procrastination and forgetting things.

Will he forget that he's giving the child a bath? Forget to pick the kid up from daycare? Forget to feed the child?", "YTA. You didn't mean to be and you're not the only one at fault here but your tone and your attitude take this from ESH to YTA.\n\nDo you have any familiarity with your husband's disorder? I'm fairly sure you don't, because most psychiatrists haven't bothered to read the recent papers and studies, so, can't really expect you to have.\n\nThe reason he doesn't procrastinate with leisure activities is because Executive Dysfunction, the root problem in ADHD, is exacerbated by anxiety and boredom. Basically the \"Make Me Go\" juice that neurotypical people like you get for free flows a lot easier in ADHD suffers when we WANT to do the thing. You throwing that in was petty and telegraphs that you think he's lying. He's not.\n\nADHD is caused by a combination of unknown factors that create a deficit of electrical activity in the pre-frontal cortex.  The pre-frontal cortex controls the following things: decision making, time management, perception of the flow of time, the stop-and-start of tasks, memory formation, working memory, and emotional regulation. All of these are Executive Functioning skills and his brain LITERALLY CAN'T DO THEM CORRECTLY.\n\nHere's an example of what makes cleaning hard for people like me, your husband, and, statistically, your unborn baby. When YOU realize the windows need to be cleaned, you see one (1) task. When YOUR HUSBAND sees that the windows need to be cleaned he sees 30 tasks, because each individual step is, to OUR brains, a separate task that requires separate decisions on his part. And for sufferers of ADHD (and I say sufferer because A) 'haver' is NOT a word and B) I suffer DAILY because this fucking curse) each decision, no matter how SMALL, takes energy and effort.  He sees cleaning the windows as the following: get up from chair, cross room, enter kitchen, locate cleaning supplies (where are the supplies? do I remember? Wife would know--can't ask Wife, she will be angry that I don't know--) return to window, wet towel with cleaning supply (it's on my arm I got it on my arm is that okay do I have to wash this off will it stain my clothes will she be mad if I stain my clothes--) scrub window, scrub window AGAIN, better this time, return supplies to their proper place (oh god wait was I supposed to use THIS cloth is this the good cloth oh god she's gonna be mad--)\n\nBonus Fun Fact: ADHD is often accompanied by anxiety (clinically significant anxiety) because the stress of our disorder leaves us at a very high chance of being abused by parents, teachers, and friends. This is exacerbated by the reason that your husband is right to call your snappy comment uncalled for: RSD aka Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. Remember how our disability (because your husband is DISABLED) causes us to lack emotional regulation (definition: the ability to self-soothe and manage our feelings in order to avoid extreme reactions)? That is especially true for feelings of rejection, mockery, and other people's wrath. In severe cases, RSD can take a sufferer from Above Baseline Happiness to Suicidal in literal seconds. You are allowed to express your frustration. He is also allowed to have FEELINGS and point out when YOU HURT THEM especially because what he did to hurt you was an ACCIDENT and what you did to hurt him was ON PURPOSE.\n\nBasically, he forgets things because his brain struggles to hold the information long enough to store it, he runs late because his brain literally cannot perceive the flow of time like you do, he struggles to clean because his brain rejects doing it the same way yours rejectioned drinking cough medicine when you were five, he rushes you through fun activities because the excitement is giving him the ability to overcome the executive dysfunction (think of selective mutes being able to speak only when comfortable), and he tries to get you to wait for him because he feels GUILTY because he doesn't know why he's doing this either!!!\n\nHe needs assistance: an expert, medications, a support group, something. He's not doing it on purpose. I am begging you to remember that. Not for his sake: for the kid's, because this disorder RUNS IN FAMILIES and most likely, you're gonna have two people with this disability in your house.\n\nHe's frigging TRYING, man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for spelling and to sound less hostile", "NTA. \n\nAm I right in assuming that he holds down a job?

It was fair and accurate criticism. 1, everything shouldn\u2019t be on your plate that he just takes some off and you\u2019re grateful. That\u2019s low bar syndrome. 2, he\u2019s an adult and has a real problem adulting. How does he parent or hold down a job w such forgetfulness? Interesting it seems strategically deployed around things he just doesn\u2019t feel like doing. That\u2019s wack. Don\u2019t apologize, do draw firm, equitable expectations and stick w them.

I'm really sorry to hear you're having another baby when you already have one at home, that's going to be very unpleasant for you. \n\nOP, have you heard the phrase \"If he wanted to, he would\" before? If your husband wanted to \"help\" you take care of your shared home, he'd do it. Even if he genuinely has ADHD he'd set calendar reminders and alarms, he'd make appointments with doctors and therapists to find medication and coping skills. He'd roll up his sleeves and pitch in instead of making excuses. He wouldn't pout and sulk and manipulate you into feeling bad for calling him out on his bullshit. The best time to nip this childishness in the bud was at the beginning of your relationship. The second best time is now, before you find yourself stuck raising two helpless kids.", "I am going with ESH. \n\nI have ADHD and I don't always remember to do something within a certain time frame and have an extremely hard time switching to doing something different when I am in the middle of something. I also have a hard time estimating how long it will take me to complete a task. That is part of ADHD but I do eventually do it. I might not get to something in the next 5 minutes but I most likely will get to it in a few hours or if it is something that can wait maybe the next day. I don't always have the executive function to do it right away. I feel like he could still try a bit harder to complete the task some time that day especially if reminded he said that he would do it. \n\nThe last incident I could see as being purely accidental. I will go to the store for bread and end up not knowing how I was gone for 2 hours. Time blindness is a real thing especially going somewhere very stimulating like a grocery store especially if it is a big box store. Even if there is no people there I want to talk to I love looking at stuff and lots of stuff catches my attention.

Yes, especially with a child on the way, there needs to be a bigger sense of urgency when it comes to responsibility, and you should think of that before having a child with any disorder. \n\nHOWEVER, someone with ADHD could be doing everything within their ability to manage it, and it's still not enough.

Especially with ADHD.\n\nYou'll see many people with ADHD in these comments claiming that they handle their symptoms just fine cuz they make planners. This does not work for everyone with ADHD. It is a spectrum, which means different people experience different severity of symptoms. \n\nMy verdict would be NAH because OP has a right to be frustrated, but I'd just like to warn people to watch the language in these situations.

She said \u201cyou have your meetings for work on your calendar. Why not do the same for your chores and other tasks?\u201d And it made so much sense \n\nSo whenever I tell my husband \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d I set an alarm on my phone for 1-2 hours later and do it when it rings.

And you have to be realistic about how much they can act like a normal person. Because the reality is they have a disorder that is recognised as needing accommodation. \n\nNow, I will say if you have ADHD you should think really hard if you're ready to have a child. It's something most parents don't think about hard enough imo, ADHD or not. \n\nBut same it's unfair to expect a person with ADHD to manage all their symptoms at all times.

In many cases those sorts of things straight up do not work.\n\nThat being said, there are things that DO work. Even self-medicating with stimulants (caffeine being the stimulant of choice for me) can work wonders to help actually get things done. It's NAH for forgetting and I don't think you're out of line for being snappy at him, especially being pregnant. If he's doing *something* at least to change it, then that's one thing. He's the AH if he doesn't even make the *attempt,* but if he's trying, then I think definitely it's not as easy as \"just do that\". Something like that gives me \"stop being sad\" vibes for people with depression.", "The top comments are unsurprising but still discouraging. Well intentioned people for sure, but I feel like people forget that ADHD is a disorder that qualifies for accommodations for a REASON. It's not just quirky hyperactivity and procrastination.

But ADHD is a spectrum, meaning the severity of symptoms are different, and different things work for different people. One person with ADHD can have an easier time managing their symptoms than others with planners alone. \n\nFor others, planners do not help enough to make too big of a difference. It's really frustrating reading the top comments all being focused on minimising this. Saying \"LOL just set alarms\" is akin to telling someone with depression to just exercise. Will it help? Possibly. Will it always work? No. And depending on severity it might not help at all. \n\nI understand that the comments feel sympathy for a struggling wife, but frankly, if your partner has a disorder, you either accept that they'll fuck up more often than the average person or you don't and your marriage will grow resentful.", "I don't have adhd and an completely neurotypical.

He coped with his adhd at work, with his band, and even when playing with the kids but he always forgot and procrastinated chores. I felt very disrespected and resentful by the end. We got therapy and learned that part of his adhd is avoiding non-prefered activities and that translated into his brain refusing to remember (this was not intentional or malicious). He now recognizes that making remembering chores is a priority or else it causes problems in our marriage.

Many people have a na\u00efve understanding of ADHD (or, frankly, of mental health in general) where the right combination of meds/therapy/coping mechanisms will turn a neurodivergent person into a neurotypical-or-close-enough person.

Whoever prescribed him medical marijuana, per your other comment about his treatment, has no clue? That\u2019s not an ADHD treatment.", "Tbh it does sound like ADHD. A lot of people think of ADHD brains as being too stimulated; the getting distracted easily, fidgeting, etc. But in actuality, ADHD brains are not stimulated *enough*. So things that are positive tend to stick in the brain better, bc they actually provide some of that positive stimulation.\n\nHowever, he needs to take more steps to remember. It sounds like he takes SOME steps, but if he has been unable to improve thus far, that means that he might need outside help (ie a therapist) to help him come up with strategies. While it's important to be understanding, it's also his responsibility to try and manage this. He needs to actively take steps to mitigate his symptoms, or he will never improve.\n\nNo one strategy works for everyone, but i can offer some recommendations of things that worked for me, or for friends of mine with ADHD. The first main thing I'd mention is that negative consequences don't work that well in managing ADHD. (I'm not saying the negative consequences aren't ever earned, just that they don't tend to help as a motivator). There is a great deal of shame, embarrassment, and even self hated that can come along with being unable to meet your own expectations, and to time and time again come up short on your responsibilities. Adding more negative feelings to the tasks can create a fear based avoidance, bc the failure feels so much worse. Instead, I've found quite a bit of success with positive reinforcement. I'll give myself \"rewards\" for completing certain tasks, so that ideally they will eventually become associated with that reward. Stuff like ordering myself bubble tea, getting a chocolate bar i like, even forcing myself to do X amount of chores before the time where I would go hang out with my friends... The forcing of a time limit with a reward at the end is particularly helpful, for me at least.\nA lot of people recommended alarms, but i personally only find them helpful in certain ways. For example, an alarm that i can easily turn off isn't helpful, bc if i am in the middle of something while it goes off, i turn it off thinking I will do the thing after what I am currently doing, only to forget. Instead, there are apps that force reminders every x amount of time (mine is set to every 5 minutes), so i will hear it every 5 minutes until I do the thing. This is what I use to make sure I've taken my medication, and for other extremely important time based things. I try limit alarms to these very important things however, bc otherwise the sound of it feels less urgent, and easier to ignore/dismiss.\nAnother tecnique is physically blocking myself with objects. If i need to vacuum tmrw when i wake up, i put the vacuum directly in front of my bed the night before. If i need to remember to take smth with me tmrw that's in the fridge, i will attach a note to my KEYS, and sometimes even put an elastic band or smth like that to tie them together, bc when I'm untying that to leave, it prompts me to think, why did I do that? And remember. Similarly. Literally taping the door shut with the reminder message on the tape can work. I think the importance is physical things that I need to interact with before I reach my goal; a note is too easily missed.\n\nI can offer some other advice if needed, but honestly, none of this will work without your husband taking an active role in doing it. It's really hard, and it definitely won't be perfect, but it's possible for him to get passed where he is now.

I guess for some people it's not about being \"reminded\",  it's more about executive dysfunction and time blindness. So if that's the case for OP's husband, idk if reminders will really help, but there are other tricks that might! And of course medication helps a lot too (if he hasn't tried that already).", "Some of the symptoms of ADHD can be treated or lessened through medication.  The medications generally are only part of a management strategy for the disorder, and cause their own new set of problems to deal with.  \n\n\nI fucking hate my brain most days.", "Medication does not alleviate the symptoms of ADHD any more than taking Dayquil alleviates the symptoms of a cold. It helps, absolutely, mostly by giving the brain dopamine to function relatively normally. But it definitely does not remove the symptoms entirely. And in fact, can make it even easier to hyperfocus on things, making it hard to task switch.", "That's such a strange thing to ask.  Why *wouldn't* she want to know more about her spouse's mental health?", "To get a better understanding of why he is the way he is and maybe not get so frustrated? \n\nIf your partner got cancer or diabetes would you do a bit of research to understand it better?", "She doesn't *have to*, but unless their planning on divorce I think most people want to understand their partner to work to a conclusion to the issue. Learning about ADHD will allow them to come to solutions that take into account his ADHD. In most people this behavior is laziness, in people with ADHD it's not that simple. \n\nPlus she's having kid with him and ADHD is very genetic. So she'll probably want to be prepared.", "I have many of the same issues. I use alarm reminders for a lot, but still have the tendency to think \"I'll finish this thing quick and then....\" and switch off the alarm almost as soon as it goes off. And 2 hours later remember.\n\nAlso, if I'm engaged in something and someone asks me to do a thing, I will automatically answer with, \"Sure, in a minute\" like out of reflex. But I have zero idea what they asked for. There are times I've sat in my chair desperately trying to remember, and then feel too embarrassed to ask, so let it go. I worse about that when I was younger, and most people have learned to just double check I actually heard them.\n\nAt work I used to have all my breaks and lunch in Outlook so I wouldn't forget to take them, because I actually got written up once for working through my morning break and lunch. And agree, post it's absolutely become part of the landscape for me after a day or two at most.\n\nAnother thing most people don't consider is when you add chronic pain to the mix. Post several neck surgeries and other medical issues, it's a problem. My speech therapist, who helps with these tips and tricks, explained that it's like everyone has 4 burners on their stove to juggle things around on, but if you have ADHD then one burner is 100% occupied with it, leaving you with 3 burners to work with. And if you have chronic pain, then a second burner is 100% occupied with that, so you only have two. Which makes managing ADHD so much harder.", "I really don't know how both of you can be wrong. Your right, most people don't get dopamine from cleaning. Some do, but that's individual and can happen to people with either adhd or not. \n\nBut where your wrong is in that it's not laziness that means they can't do it. People without ADHD don't need a dopamine hit with everything they do, it's good when they get one and they still seek it out for fun, but they are able to function while doing boring tasks. That's because they have a baseline level of dopamine already there that keeps them going through tasks like that. When people without adhd are messy, that's because there's something else going on. Like depression, laziness, or they just might have a lower standard of cleanliness to other people.\n\nIn those with ADHD though, that baseline level is a lot lower. So their brain is constantly seeking out more. That has a lot of side effects, but the main thing is that they find it really painful to do things which don't give dopamine. Some are still able to clean because they find having a clean house gives them a dopamine hit, or they might be the type where task completion makes them happy. Or they have management strategies. Like giving themselves a piece of chocolate at the end (I so wish that worked for me).  Medication can also lower that baseline level which then allows them to function. Can though, not will.", "Well, yes. But that's why I qualified what I said by saying \"sometimes.\" \n\nSaying YOU FIGURE IT OUT all caps without some caveat acknowledging reality is essentially just another way of saying \"just do it,\" or having a \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps,\" mentality.", "I don't feel thirsty until I start drinking something", "It was six paragraphs of caveat. There was a lot of context showing I clearly was not telling someone to \"just do it\". Instead, that part of ADHD was about recognizing that since \"just do it\" clearly doesn't work for us *we have to take the steps to figure out the things that do, actually, work for us.* Which is hard, and can take a while, but is not optional.", "does the weed help his symptoms at all? Weed as a treatment for ADHD doesn\u2019t have a lot of solid evidence yet, from what I have read it seems like it depends largely on the person and sometimes it helps and sometimes it makes things worse. THC does trigger dopamine so its appealing to people with ADHD but that doesn\u2019t mean it actually helps (though anecdotally it does help some people with focus)", "Unfortunately, you can\u2019t always delegate the \u201cfun jobs\u201d laundry has to be done, dishes have to be cleaned, most of life is the same repetitive stuff and it\u2019s not fair for one person to always have to do it or constantly mother their partner into doing their share. \n\nWhy is it her job to \u201cgive him something different?\u201d Why is SHE the one who has to decide this? I understand being partners means understanding your partner\u2019s weaknesses and trying to be understanding and supportive. However, there comes a point where the neurodivergent partner needs to realize they are being drastically unfair to their spouse and too many people don\u2019t give that fact the weight it deserves.", "But if you are not able to be a true partner. Should you be in a relationship? Or even have children? Why should your partner and child suffer?", "Totally agree. This applies to any mental illness. If you date someone with generalized anxiety disorder, you\u2019re going to deal with someone who occasionally breaks down in anxiety. It will impact your life and schedule. \n\nI don\u2019t think this sub would be nearly as understanding if a person said \u201cthat\u2019s your problem, you need to deal with this\u201d to a person having an anxiety attack.", "or you get my personal favourite problem.....\n\nforgetting to take my meds...\n\nI have got to the point where another friend of mine I work with reminds me first thing in the morning to take my meds when I log in, and I remind him to take his afternoon dose, since we both struggle at different times due to our different meds. it helps sometimes at least....", "Forming the morning medication habit was a struggle, no joke, and it's still not 100%. But it's a good 90%, so *shrug*"]}
