He has ADHD and I'm sure that plays a role but I will say that it mostly comes down to things like chores. When it comes to leisure activities, he doesn't procrastinate at all and usually rushes me. \n\nSo basically he will say things like \"I will do the dishes when I get back from the store\" and then never do them because he forgets. Or if trash needs to be taken out, he will say \"wake me up in the morning when you get the kids on the bus and I will do it then\" but then never does. If the house needs cleaning and I start getting to work, he will try to convince me to wait a few hours so he can \"help\" but if I do wait, it never gets done. And it truly is him forgetting. It's not deliberate by any means. Even if he is the one cooking dinner that night he will usually forget that he's cooking and randomly say \"Oh shit\" and run out of the room at a buck 10 so he doesn't burn the food because he truly forgot he was cooking at all (I always remember and am super aware of everything so obviously I would never let it get to a point of disaster- BUT I do make a point to not say anything unless I absolutely have to). \n\nAnyways, this is how it's always been. I'm so used to it at this point that it doesn't really bother me. I actually enjoy cleaning but some days the help would be nice and he does help when he actually remembers. He's not useless by any means and he does absolutely try to take the load off my hands. He truly just forgets often. But I will say that lately I've been frustrated. I'm 20 weeks pregnant. Getting a little slow on movement and increasingly tired and dare I say lazy myself. I still do my part but I admittedly do not want to. Hormones and fatigue are a bitch. But anyways, I got in a deep clean mode like two days ago and started going ham on this house. My husband said he wanted to help me but had an appointment to detail a vehicle first. So he leaves. The appointment should have only been an hour but he came back in roughly two and a half. Turns out he knew the guy from school and they were catching up. By the time he got home, the house was sparkling clean. He says something like \"Shit, I should have came home sooner. I got caught up and forgot.\" So I said \"That sounds like a you problem\". He asked what I meant and I said \"You forgetting everything is a you problem. I've dealt with it for years and I no longer want to hear it used as an excuse.\" I was frustrated. My back was killing me and I just wanted to sit and enjoy my book in peace without being disturbed. He shook his head and said \"That was uncalled for\" and walked off.

You look up and it'd been 6hrs and you didn't do anything you planned and you couldn't say what you *did* the entire time. Like some one is just stealing time from you.

Do not give open ended tasks give time limits,  if you know he is home, \"I really need x being done by Y time, that would be a really be help, then make sure you demonstrate how happy you are that ge helped giving him the dopamine fix he needs to want to keep meeting the targets\"   we gave a job chart in our house that looks like a reward chart, my husband uses it as a competition with himself to try and get more of his colour on the chart than mine in a day, it's broken down into simple steps do nothing us overwhelming,  eg  put on washing, hang out washing/put it in dryer, gather in washing, fold washing, put everything away.  Hover with each room gaving its own tick.

The other the kitchen, we both do that after bedtime before we sit down.  Routines as much as they may be hated are a must for most nurodivergent people (I am also nurodivergent)  honestly thought sort things out now, you are going to get less able and there is a good chance you will be organising an ADHD child if your husband is ADHD learning how to motivate and support your husband will mean you have more tools for an ADHD child, meaning they are more likely to ve able to forfill thier potential x", "Your husband \"forgets\" because he knows you'll be there to take over whatever he fails to do.\n\nThis is a VERY unhealthy dynamic to be bringing a baby into.

But on those occasions, I apologize and identify ways to avoid making the same mistake (I now check my calendar for the rest of the day and action any reminders before deciding on a phone-free afternoon).", "She even said he's tried being medicated and had a bad psychical reaction to it, unclear why you think he ISNT trying just because he isn't magically neurotypical", "If he's ever interested in trying medication again, I would suggest trying pharmacogenetic testing-- I discovered that every antidepressant I tried was less than effective and muted my emotions entirely, but when I found the right medication through a genetic test, I realized those side effects were because my body just wasn't processing it properly and I finally found a medication that allowed me to feel a full spectrum of emotions. (I was also doing therapy, which is a good thing because I then had to learn how to handle the fact that I could feel things again lol)\n\nIt sounds like your spouse is really benefiting from therapy though, so it might not be an option you even need to explore, just putting it out there!", "How many different medications did he try? It might just have been the wrong kind...", "It depends on what you take. Some natural supplements have been studied. There are techniques for coping strategies with ADHD you can learn in a book or learning program if you look for one that's legit. Yes some (maybe even most) are bullshit, but not all. I've seen psychiatrists say that if stimulants aren't available to you for some reason, rhodiola could help. No doctor is going to recommend it right off the bat because stimulants are *more* effective and well-regulated. The point is that it's his responsibility to find techniques that help him function. There are tons of people with ADHD and they find systems and solutions.", "bc they're suggesting shit that doesn't work. just repeating what ppl tell literally every disabled person regardless of disability", "I don't have ADHD but I have another disorder where both the disorder and the meds that treat some of the symptoms can lead to non-existant dopamine and executive disfunction, which removes motivation and the ability to feel pleasure from anything at all. When I'm like this, even if I can remember what I need to do and it's sitting right in front of me, I literally cannot get my body to actually do it. If I somehow can make the motions, I still can't figure out how exactly to get it done even if it should be easy to do so. It's gotten so bad that I've been temporarily puzzled by a sink before, trying to wash my hands. People seriously underestimate just how reward driven the human brain is, if the reward isn't there then sometimes you literally cannot do it. Sometimes you literally cannot get your mind to move the way it needs to move for you to figure out or remember how to do it. Normal people seem completely unable to comprehend the difference between disability and laziness when it comes to mental stuff, they can understand why a person in a wheelchair can't run up the stairs but not why someone without dopamine and executive dysfunction doesn't have a pristine well organized home.", "/u/Puzzlehfgj is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.

You're projecting extremely hard here and you need to simmer down. Nowhere did I say he should magically or immediately be NT, and nowhere did I say he *needed* to be medicated. Just that what he's been doing is not good for him, his wife, and their relationship. Clearly he isn't trying, or isn't trying that hard, if his wife has gotten tired of providing that kind of emotional labor (who wants to spend all day nagging their significant other to do literally any chore whatsoever?).\n\nGonna step in here before you tell me I'm the autistic equivalent of a self hating gay and say that I've \"internalized ableism\" or something like that and just say, ADHD (and autism) are reasons, not excuses. If you neglect your mental and emotional health to the point it is affecting other people, you are not doing your best. That's all."]}
