There are no speakers at my store, so whenever one of us is working the single register up front, we\u2019re allowed to play any music we like so long as it\u2019s not obscene. Of course, around this time of year many stores are already playing Christmas music, so all of my coworkers are getting into the spirit and playing Christmas music at the register. They\u2019re even blasting it in the back room. I don\u2019t really like it, so when I\u2019m in the back I just wear earbuds and play what I like. \n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of Christmas music, or the holiday in general, so I\u2019ve opted for playing soft violin and piano music at the register instead. Apparently all of my coworkers have taken notice, and this morning my manager pulled me aside and asked if I play Christmas music at the register on my register day. I told her no, and she asked me if I could. I asked if I had to, and she said she would prefer Christmas music played at the register around the holidays, especially since I work on one of our busiest days. I asked if I could pick out the songs or if she had specific ones in mind, and she said as long as it\u2019s Christmas it\u2019s fine, so I told her no problem and made a playlist of the Christmas music I DO like, still including violin and piano pieces that are covers of some popular Christmas songs/carols/themes/etc.\n\nLater that day, I was wearing earbuds while they played Christmas in the back room and one of my coworkers yanked my earbud out and loudly asked why I\u2019m not listening to the Christmas music that\u2019s playing and why I hate Christmas so much. I tried to keep my cool and told het I don\u2019t hate it, I\u2019m just not a fan, and she and many of my other coworkers called me \u201cScrooge\u201d and tagged on me about it all afternoon, sometimes loud enough that I could hear them over the music in my earbuds. My manager just laughed and when she saw me looking upset told me to lighten up and that it\u2019s all in good fun. I didn\u2019t find it fun. That was two days ago, and today I\u2019m on register. After twenty minutes of Christmas music I switched back to my normal classical playlist and one coworker has already made a comment. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit- For those of you who keep referencing religion and my possible religious standing, I am in fact not Christian. I was raised baptist and come from a conservative Christian family and have childhood religious trauma from attending church. So while I don\u2019t mind Christmas music, some of it does being up bad memories.

It will soon be over.", "I have worked in the retail world for over eleven years and I find your coworkers baffling. Most company's that do overhead music have adjusted their Playlist to have non-Christmas music in the mix for the sanity of the workers that are there every day. You are definitely NTA for your stance.\n\nYour coworkers are definitely AHs but at the end of the day, your manager is condoning this behavior and unless theres a policy hes aware of that you are not (and if he didnt inform you of it, he is a fool) he is creating a terrible work environment that is likely turning into an ethical and compliance nightmare \n\nI will say that unless youre planning to leave the company after the season, you should consider formal ways to address this problem. Obviously i dont know where you are or what company you work for, so take this advice with a grain of salt since its built from own experience with a large corporate chain retailer. My suggestion would be this: \n\n1) stop listening to Christmas music. Unless this is company policy they cannot dictate what you do in regards to this. Be aware of potential fallout though (i.e. vindictive manager yanks the ability for anyone to play music at their register, depending on amount of leeway your corporate offices allow the individual stores to operate at)\n\n2) utilize your corporate complaint structure to its maximum effect. A coworker touching your property or taunting you is not acceptable. If the manager is condoning this behavior, you need to speak to a different manager higher in the chain of command. If none is available, you need to register a complaint with your home office. I would be shocked and amazed if they didn't have some sort of specific office for compliance/ethical complaints. Big companies do not want lawsuits, especially from their employees.\n\n3) get documentation of your complaints. If your work gives you some sort of e-mail, use it for all interactions regarding this situation. E-mail the manager directly asking for their specific guidance and cc someone higher than them. Store manager is usually best, but if this is the store manager doing this, your field manager for your area and/or a corporate compliance officer. Cite as much specific company policy as you can. If you cannot access company policy or were not issued a company handbook, this needs to be known to those above you.\n\n4) do not talk to hr at your store level unless you legitimately trust them. I know this seems counterintuitive, but remember hr is there to protect the company, not you. The more layers of complaints you have in a chain of command, the harder retaliation is and many hr reps will try to find a way to terminate you rather than deal with your complaint. If they want a meeting with you (and likely the manager the complaint will be against) do not agree to without a witness (aka someone higher up the chain than the manager you register a complaint against) or a way to document the meeting.\n\n5) and finally once a formal complaint is filed, if they do anything that is not specific enforcement of company policy against you, it is retaliation. You need to file a new complaint each time this happens. This can be insidious and take many forms, from your hours randomly being cut, being assigned specific duties outside the purview of your job or simply allowing your fellow employees to continue to badger you without intervening.", "NTA.  But stop using your phone. They can't dictate that you have to play a certain genre on your device. Just no music at all.
