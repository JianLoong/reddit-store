I'm extremely happy for her as she is doing something she loves and is interested in. She works everyday and she loves it.\n\nHere's the but.\n\nShe works everyday and now she's tired. The laundry isn't getting done and the cleaning isn't getting done either. I proposed that she hire a maid to help her with this stuff. Someone who could help do the cleaning. She works, she gets paid, but she doesn't spend money. She called me an asshole because she's thinks that I'm calling her useless. That's not the case. She always tired and always complains about it.

That can\u2019t always be equal given circumstances. If you earn a lot more, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to contribute more financially. If you work/study less, you do a bit more in and around the house.\n\nNow that she\u2019s working as well, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to share the household work. Now that she\u2019s earning money, it\u2019s also perfectly reasonable for her to make a financial contribution to the household income as well. \n\nWhat\u2019s not reasonable, is for you to make the housework entirely her problem, and the solution entirely her cost. It\u2019s a shared responsibility, which you should equally contribute towards solving, within the time, energy and means that you both have. \n\nEqually so, no that she\u2019s earning an income, she should offer to contribute a fair contribution to the shared household costs.", "NAH, but you two need to communicate calmly and respectfully about the necessary shift in responsibilities now that she is working outside the home. Maybe the split in finances as well as household chores will be entirely re-thought. It\u2019s fine. Both of you have good intentions so there is no need for anyone to be offended or sensitive about the changes. Just work them out together - or have a therapist mediate if needed.", "YTA\n\nthe answer here is because you both work, the house chores should be divided between you both.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt you to pitch in and help, that is what happens in a normal healthy relationship where both parties work.", "A career will slow down any homemaking aspirations if life isn't balanced. And you had to anticipate that when she began working full time the work load in your home would have to shift? Did it ever occur to you that you both now work full time and you both should be managing household chores?\n\nShe wants and expects you to help - not tell her that now that she has money she should outsource the workload and pay for the privilege. (She didn't finish her education and get a job so she could pay for a maid, after all.)\n\nYTA for not seeing that you really should always have been helping out. This is pretty standard in a couple that they work together in their free time to maintain their environment.", "NTA for suggesting it, but it should be a joint decision.", "Bad communication probably. Or the way that\u2019s framed. Maybe she is exhausted/irritable due to the new routine.\n\nNTA for proposing a solution. \n\nAs other comments said, a reassessment of expectations and financial responsibility should clear the misunderstanding.", "YTA.

If not where is \"her\" money going?", "I'd go with NTA - but because you made your post quite gender-rolled, I imagine my opinion won't be the popular one. If you guys as a couple have split the household duties one way and now that isn't working - a different solution should be found.", "YTA\n\nIt was one thing to consider all the housework her job when you were the only one working. She was obviously a student this whole time. Even then, you should have been doing more of your own housework. Now that the situation has changed, you should be picking up the slack **even if** you two decide its necessary to get the help of a domestic employee.", "NTA.\n\nI don't quite understand the people in the comments. If she works, but doesn't pay any bills, doesn't help financially around the house, what's the big problem with paying a day laborer or someone to clean the house in her place? They both work, but only one supports the house financially, so to be honest, I don't think it's a problem that he came up with this idea.\n\nTalk to her when she is calmer, or help with some things around the house, find something that is beneficial for both of you.

You are both working, why is the home still HER job?\n\nIt's both your jobs. She's your partner, not your mommy, you both hold equal responsibility for chores. Do your part, and quit the toxic notion that you'd be \"helping\" her, because it's your job as much as it is hers.\n\nAnd then if you still need a cleaner, then you both hire one. \n\nYTA. You're an adult, act like one.", "ETA\n\nThe dynamic changed, that\u2019s the bottom line.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to be a SAHM and you don\u2019t want to do household chores.

The laundry isn't getting done and the cleaning isn't getting done either. I proposed that she hire a maid to help her with this stuff.\n\nGee, here's an idea, why don't you share the household chores.

That\u2019s NORMAL, that\u2019s EXPECTED. I think she\u2019s just so used to doing it all that she\u2019s feeling bad about herself for not being able to keep up. Which is okay, part of helping with that is just giving her reassurance and reminding her you\u2019re proud of her. \n\nI do think that before immediately just hiring a maid that y\u2019all should talk and equally divide the household chores and try to manage it that was first. If yall still aren\u2019t able to keep up with it (which again, is entirely possible and normal if yall are both working long hours which I\u2019m assuming yall are) THEN hire a maid to come like once a week.", "Since you both work why on earth would you think it's still all her responsibility to do household chores?

Sounds like s good idea to get help when you are both working", "Here's a radical thought, you could HELP HER WITH THE HOUSEWORK!!!  Sharing the work halves the work.  So yeah, even though you have the money for a maid, YTA", "NAH. I might get downvoted for this take but whatever. If you have been in a more traditional relationship for so long, it\u2019s fair to expect that to continue. She wanted this nursing job and got it and you were happy for her, great! That doesn\u2019t mean your work/hobbies change overnight to accommodate that. OP sounds like he didn\u2019t really want to change his routine to do more housework, so he wants to hire it out, great! I literally don\u2019t know what everyone\u2019s issue is. You are allowed to hire people to clean your house/do laundry etc if you can afford it.\n\nI think your girlfriend may be taking offense because she perceives it as \u201cyou dont think she\u2019s good enough\u201d. I personally would be grateful for home help, but not everybody sees it that way. My mom is like this a bit.\n\nI think you should have an honest chat with your gf with both of you being realistic about your time and energy levels. :)", "YTA, What do YOU do?", "YTA.  Why does she have to pay for the maid?  Not even a 50/50 split?  Wow.", "NAH\u2026 you can hire a maid yourself and tell her your putting your foot down, why make life hard when it can be easy. You can afford a maid do it", "YTA. Suggesting that you get help around the house because she has a career is not the part that makes you a jerk. You framed the entire problem as if it is her problem, when in reality, laundry not getting done and other household chores is now equally your problem and your wives problem. If you split the burden of house chores with her, and THEN you suggest \"hey, this sucks, we're both tired from work, how do you feel about hiring some help around the house for US\" then I would say you'd be NTA and it would be purely a financial discussion of how much you as a team want to spend. Dividing roles in a relationship can be very healthy, but at the end of the day, you're a team, you want to make sure you act as such. \n\nOverall not a huge deal, pretty soft YTA, but,  I'd  apologize, pick up slack around the house  and revisit the topic later if you want.", "YTA. You\u2019re both working and yet you still expect her to do all the housework and you do nothing to help, except complain that she\u2019s tired after working a full day at work and then coming home and working again with no break and no appreciation? So then you tell *her* to hire someone to *help her* do the housework while you still do absolutely nothing to help??!! Yikes! YTA big time", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds bad that you say \"to help her with this stuff.\", when realistically it is helping both of you with that stuff, but if you can afford a maid, it should be a win-win.\n\nDo a cost benefit analysis, and decide how much it is worth it for both of you to not have to worry about that stuff. If you find that you can not afford it, you would be an AH though for making her do it all along side her own work. Now that she has a job you either both hire a maid jointly, or you both share the duties.\n\nIt is understandable though that she might feel that you are not appreciating her efforts with housework, to suggest that you can just hire someone to do it might sound like \"anyone can do it.\" which might take away a source of pride she had or one of the things she did to show how much she cares about you, and that you do not appreciate that care. You have to make sure that with the time saved from her not doing that housework, there is something else more enjoyable and realising she can do to feel like she is showing her care for you.\n\nIn my situation, my partner is \"traditional\" in some ways, in that she feels like (and it is in her culture and family tradition) that she should cook for me. Personally I really don't care what I eat so long as it is halfway healthy, and I could eat the same thing everyday for a month and be happy, but she feels guilty if I have to eat the same thing every day, as if she is not doing her duty. Even if I cook a weeks worth  of diners for myself, she can not just relax and accept it, so she has to cook. Even if we go out to eat, she still feels a need to cook.\n\nIt is something in her and how she sees her own value. While I wish she would just relax, I also do not argue with her about it and try to show appreciation and not mention too much that I really don't need it.", "NTA but you need to have a discussion of what kind of roles you see each other in in the relationship going forward. \n\nYou are running two businesses and are paying for most things as things stand right now, right? It wouldn't make sense for you to devote yourself to doing half the housework if that would have to come with say, giving up so much time it becomes difficult to work and earn as you have been. It makes more sense to hire a maid if that isn't a financial burden.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e doesn't want a maid, what is her proposed solution? Something has to give.", "NTA. But your wife needs to like the person who is being hired and be on board with it.  Suggest people are invited to interview for the job.  Work on her gently, she may come round to the idea, don't expect instant results.  Ask neighbours for referrals.\n\nI don't want a cleaner, my partner does.  My partner brought in a group of three cleaners one day for 2 hours.  Two of them were fine, one was dreadful.  I was beyond p\\*ssed and it got very ugly.  Don't force it.", "Yta.\n\nYOU hire the maid and pay the maid. Since you don't do shit.\n\nShe probably can do her own laundry and dishes.\n\nYou're an unfunctional adult.", "NTA at all. Your idea is thoughtful and appropriate in a two income home that can afford it. It sounds like you just need to communicate it better and express that this is out of concern for her and meant as a help to the household and that you\u2019re proud of her accomplishments and work. I would tell her this and then handle the hiring.", "NTA based on your comment about you are running 2 businesses. \n\nHaving someone come in to do the deep cleaning while you two do the basic things that need to be done more regularly is not a bad idea. \n\nI do agree with others that you could pick up some of the chores as well. I mean you live there too. The way your post reads is you expect her to do the chores on top of working full time.\n\nNow I am kinda leaning more Y T A but like you had said earlier if you have the resources and are busy running businesses maybe you're not.\n\nI'm waffling on my judgment here. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So let me get this straight.  You provided for her while she was a student, now she got a job she doesn't want to help around the house, doesn't want to hire someone to help around the house, nor does she want to spend the money she earned on things that both of you would benefit from?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can we talk about some alternatives like professional cleaning services like a maid? I think It would help us both out with stress.\" That's about word for word what I would say to my wife if we were in this situation. Rn im staying at home not my wife and not working, but that could change, and we would probably need some help cleaning too if I went back to work. Maybe offer to make it a team effort to hire. That's really the only issue I saw with your post. You were like SHE needs to hire someone. In reality the both of you need to hire someone, because it isn't her job as the woman to do. It was her job as the stay at home adult to do. Now there isn't a stay at home adult. That's a problem for you both, not a problem she alone needs to fix.", "NTA. I think froma purely practical standpoint, hiring a maid totally makes sense. It made sense for her to do all the household stuff while you worked and she didn't, seems like she got the better part of that deal to be honest. Now that she's working, things have obviously changed, and if you're both doing pretty well financially it makes sense to just hire someone to do that stuff instead of unnecessary additional workload on either of you.  \n\nNot knowing her, this is just speculative but maybe she's interpreting your suggestion the way she is because she's internalized the expectation of being a good housekeeper as part of her identity due to traditional gender stereotypes. It's worth a further discussion, and maybe try to emphasize you're just trying to find a practical solution and don't want either of you to burn out by.puttting too much on eithernof your plates.", "EVERYONE SUCKS!", "Info: did you up front agree on having traditional roles, or was it situational?\n\nIf the first, how did the both of you not see this coming? What did you expect her to do after collage? Or did you assume the 8 hours of work each day would just magically fit in the existing 24? \n\nIf the latter, why is the household not your problem? Just because you started traditional, does not mean you have a claim to it. When my sister went to college, she managed the household while her partner worked. Then she worked, while he went to do his masters, and he managed the household. And now they both work, and both take care of half of the household...", "I think before you get married, the two of you need to have a talk regarding your financial future.  Your ok to let her work and contribute nothing and you don\u2019t know what she does with her money?  Sounds great. You sound above snd beyond most people. But how long will you be ok with this arrangement?  I think finances, savings, expenses, retirement, vacations, Should be shared by both incomes. You want to pay all that and not know where her money even goes? You get the saint award and must make a very good income.", "Nta.

Really appreciate this", "That was EXACTLY my thought.", "Right, but I don't ask her to pitch in for the insurance, the cars, the house, the utilities. We both work, like I said, but she doesn't spend money on anything? I'm simply asking her to hire a maid to help her", "Ahh I see this point of view. I appreciate it. I suggested a maid because I see that the work life balance isn't good. I help her occasionally, but often I'm tired too lol. I know the money she makes isn't for a maid. And I'm sure she's saving her money and definitely not wanting to split the bills because like I said I took the role as a provider, but $200 for a maid for just a day doesn't seem like a bad idea. And instead of doing chores, we can spend that time doing other things like being tired together lol", "Right? I did bring it up because she tired a lot and I get it. I'm tired too lol I brought up the idea and I wasn't trying to offend her.", "She is not contributing to household expenses.

I run two different businesses and we're both putting in this work. She was a student and didn't have a problem before. We're in a good financial situation where she can hire the help. So why not?", "This is an example of the gender politics pendulum swinging too far. I\u2019m so glad to see that we are discussing the disparity between gender and sex norms/tasks/expectations. \n\nHowever, not every argument or disagreement between a different sex couple is about gender expectations. If this was about 2 women or 2 men, I do believe the comments would be far more constructive and reasonable. \n\nOP asked her to take on one expense in their household of expenses. He isn\u2019t asking for repayment, equally split bills, equitably split bills, or for her to continue using her time and energy when she\u2019s home to cater to him. He came up with a very reasonable solution. Good god, how I wish I had that option. Would I feel some pressure in her shoes, though? Probably- and it would all be self-placed. I would feel like a bit of a failure for not keeping up, and I might be defensive in my partner bringing it up (even with a reasonable solution), especially if I was already in my head about it. Sometimes, it can be hard to admit that we can\u2019t do it all and need help. \n\nOP sounds like a generous and reasonable person. He has supported his partner in her path to get where she is, and she contributed in a non financial way to their household. He sees that she is in need of a shift in her day-to-day. He offered up a solution, not an ultimatum. The responses on here almost seem like he\u2019s demanded her to quit her job to take care of the home. He hasn\u2019t demanded that. He also hasn\u2019t demanded that she work full time and come home and do domestic work. He\u2019s asked her to financially contribute to one expense. Which just so happens to be related to domestic duties. Which, as someone who got a useless degree studying gender, does not scream a gendered issue.", "She is not. But I don't ask her to contribute! I just want a maid lol to help her", "Very reasonable response. I think similarly.", "It\u2019s not really fair to expect a traditional relationship structure to continue, honestly. It seems it was only that way because she was studying with no or little income. \n\nThe issue is OP is pushing off anything domestic as her sole responsibility, when they are both working now. They need to reevaluate how they split responsibilities.", "Thank you for the advice! The fiance is great and the best. Maybe she was tired when I approached her about it and got offended!

Dude that's a dub if you ask me", "Because he\u2019s already carrying the load of all the expenses. He\u2019s asking her to cover one expense rather than both of them using limited time and energy to do domestic work. It\u2019s not about the domestic job being hers, he\u2019s acknowledging that they\u2019re both tired. In all this time, he\u2019s financially carried everything. It is very common that when we have less time, yet make more money, we begin to outsource tasks. He\u2019s asking her to finance outsourcing this one task. There\u2019s nothing unfair about this request.", "He could suggest that they equitably split the bills, but he\u2019s not. Hes not asking her to continue the domestic work. He\u2019s asking her to take on one expense out of their many.", "I don\u2019t read this as a gendered issue AT ALL. He has carried the financial load for her to get her degree and has supported her finding a career that she is happy in. He isn\u2019t asking for her to keep doing the housework. He isn\u2019t asking her to take on any of their already established expenses. He\u2019s asking her to take financial responsibility of one thing that would improve both of their quality of life. \n\nShe may have reacted strongly because she may have silent pressure that she should be able to \u201chave it all.\u201d She may be putting the pressure on herself, and be upset with herself for not keeping up in the same way. \n\nHe\u2019s not discouraging her from working, he\u2019s not asking for her paycheck, he\u2019s not demanding that she come home and keep working through domestic work. He\u2019s just asking for her to contribute to the household in a fractionally small financial way compared to what he is. He came up with a solution that I see as respectful to her time and her finances. He doesn\u2019t even want to split the expenses, which would likely take even more from her earnings.", "Well it's not that I see it as a gendered task. More so, she been doing it for 4 years and I guess I got used to it. But I'd rather she pay for a maid to help rather than split the bills lol. It's cheaper, it helps us. Cause I got us taken care of. She doesn't really need the job, she likes it and I'm supportive, it's just that this thing changed. I'm not asking her to quit, or anything. Not even to split the bills. I work my ass off to have the things we need and shoot as a graduation gift I'm helping her get a new bmw lol. (She wants it, I suggested a Toyota) Is asking her for a maid really making me an asshole?", "Amen! I would gladly accept someone coming once a week to do the deep stuff and laundry. Gladly. Especially as a single parent working full time with another 10 hours of commute time. Time is precious and I would much rather outsource some tasks if I could afford to.", "Lol idk about wealthy but we work really hard and I think it's something we can afford.", "Not split evenly, split *equitably* based on the proportion of income you each bring to the household. So if you make 1.5 times what she makes, you would pay 60% and she would pay 40%, or you could just divide things up by what each of you is willing to take on (and she should take on at least *some* of it now that she's bringing in an income as well).\n\nAnd you should take on an equitable amount of the household tasks as well, including the mental load behind them, from conception, into planning, and through execution.", "It sounds like you think she's YOUR servant bc you pay for things.  She's not subservient to you despite you thinking that you are a \"provider\".  You are in a partnership no one is subservient or provider.  Those mindsets are toxic and incredibly damaging to a relationship.  If you truly can't afford to pay for items then discuss like a TEAM.  Just bc you pay for things doesn't not mean that she then owes you manual labor.  You don't get to throw money at things in a relationship and then expect her to do all the work.  Split the household chores like adults and renegotiate finances if it's bothering you.", "The thing is, it shouldn't be \"if you ask me\", you should be asking HER how she thinks things should be divided.  Have you asked her that, calmly?  Ask and listen to how she envisions things, and work on compromise from there.\n\nAlso, many couples will split costs according to income. so that if one spouse makes 60 % of the income, they pay 60% of expenses.", "It would be a win if these situations were ever looked at through a lens of true equality. What this group will want you to do is keep paying for everything, then come home and do 50% of the chores and if she says she\u2019s too tired to do her 50%, you pick that up too in the name of love and \u201cequality.\u201d No logic will be applied here.", "You are being used.", "No...split the bills and YOU help with chores.\nSome people don't like maids in their spaces. They value their privacy.\n\nAnd unless you have a lice in maid, there arevalways chores.", "You set up a joint account for household expenses and the money comes out of there, including the maid.\n\nIf she pays the maid directly it is a mind fuck because she is paying someone to do a job she no longer had time to do.", "I can see how asking her to pay for a maid is like asking her to pay for a person to do things she can no longer do because she is working. They should have a joint account for household expenses and the money come out of there. So technically she is still paying for the maid, just not directly paying the maid. It is all about psychology", "Yes! I'm happy she's doing something she loves, and I see that we have an opportunity to improve our quality of life! I really wasn't trying to be disrespectful though even though she may have taken it that way!", "That\u2019s the problem. They make it a gendered situation because that drives their pre-determined viewpoint.", "The issue is you\u2019ve gone from a single income household to a dual income household but you haven\u2019t shifted your roles accordingly. Why not split your shared expenses in proportion to your income and share the cost of a house cleaner? You insisting that cleaning is still her responsibility- whether she does it herself or pays for it, is really weird. You both live in the house.", "Agreed", "I think that you should approach this in a different setting. Preface this with how much you have appreciation for her, and that you just want the best quality of life for her and also you. This isn\u2019t about what she\u2019s not doing, it\u2019s that you see that it far more valuable for her to use her energy in ways that make sense. Give a trial run of a maid, maybe as a compromise, and after a set amount of time, revisit the conversation. Check in and see how you both feel about this new arrangement. Be respectful of each other. Ask her what made her feel offended, as that was not your intent. Ask her if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s been on her mind, that she hasn\u2019t been able to share. Likely, there is. Usually, when people react strongly and as if they\u2019re offended by something that would most likely be helpful, there\u2019s something else under the surface. I\u2019m guilty.", "Keep in mind our relationship has been traditional for years.\nAnd I'm only asking for a maid. Lol not to split the bills. And she has a good paying job. \nIs it really that weird?"]}
