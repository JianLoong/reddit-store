Her sister doesn't drive yet so she goes every morning with her mom to her workplace and stays there then goes to her school.\n\nI said yes that she could come, but then I asked \"Is this going to keep happening?\" (her sister coming over in the mornings), to which she got really heated and said, \"Does that really bother you?\". I said I don't know, and she stormed off the room. \n\nI don't really know how to feel about this. I work in the afternoons so I would be there when her sister is here.\n\nI just feel it's different when we invite friends over at night to drink because I am well dressed and the house is clean for guests. But if her sister is coming over in the mornings (that's when we usually clean) I don't feel so comfortable as I am in a tank top and shorts and will have to offer her breakfast and make conversation.

Even if GF and sister don't expect that, he'll have to learn what their expectations are to know if he's comfortable with having someone else in his space on a regular basis.\n\nPeople have different energy and comfort levels.

Generally speaking anyhow.\n\nHaving been married twice, #1 for 8yrs+, #2 for 35 and counting. And, the most important truths I learned in lo those 44yrs, is compromise and caring.  Compromise anytime you can, and caring for/loving her, means caring about what and who she cares about, to at least some degree. \n\nAlso, having a little sister is something OPs' gf and I have in common, if my little sister needed a place to hang and study for a few hrs a day, I'd have done what I could to help her out.  \n\nSo his essential options are,\n\n A: Compromise & care and strengthen the relationship with the woman he presumably loves.\n\nB: Indicate to his SO that her loved ones and her feelings mean little or nothing to him. \n\nC: Break up now and avoid a likely downhill slide to the end.\n\nIf they love and respect each other, they'll both do a fair share of compromising with, and caring for each other, especially when it's hard to summon the grace of maturity. \n\nBut hell, I could be all wrong, the only experience I possess is personal and anecdotal. But the stats for marriage longevity support the notion.", "I means, he\u2019s right it seems probable.

That may not be completely what you intended (though, to be fair, she\u2019s not welcome by you at that time), but that\u2019s how your girlfriend interpreted it.\n\nCommunication is very important, especially at this stage when you are learning to live together. Give it a minute, then approach the situation again when you both have cooler heads and are able to really listen to each other. Remember that compromise is the key to any good relationship.

So, it will definitely not be a once-off.", "\"Does that really bother you?\". I said I don't know, and she stormed off the room. \nFirst of all, this response to the question could potentially make you sound weak to your gf. If your going to live with someone you should try to be more firm when you comment about your feelings. \"I don't know\" is the type of response that says \"walk all over me because I'm indecisive\". People get upset with each other all the time for many reasons, it's part of any relationship. Try not to let emotions dictate the way you act around her when it comes to major decisions like this. This is definitely an awkward situation and I hope your gf will come to her senses and act with a bit more maturity.

I  think you're being TAH for sure", "ESH. She should have talked to OP about this, but also, how does OP move her in without knowing how close she is to her sister? Oh yeah, because the relationship is still brand spanking new. Clearly, a lot of basic personal boundaries haven't been discussed.\n\nIt doesn't say anything about the GF badgering OP into letting her move in. It says they're furnishing the house together, so there's not any reason to believe the GF is a freeloader. So I'm gonna assume they both made a stupid decision to move in so early in the relationship.\n\nOP didn't share their gender.

I think you jumped to all sorts of hypotheticals and assumptions immediately about her sister. Why would you prematurely insinuate that she\u2019s going to be mooching and it seems you already feel her sisters going to be a leech based off your post. You came off callus towards your gf by making it a point that she first know your unsolicited response and pretty much letting her know your not going to deal with her relatives. I mean\u2026 you\u2019re letting your gf know you don\u2019t care about her or her family. She\u2019s not going to feel comfortable with you if you keep acting so recklessly. I hope next time you start with asking her if everything is alright with her sister or mom. Her mom may have had an emergency or her sister may have had an incident that compelled her to immediately want to provide her sibling (who she was raised with her entire life, she\u2019s NOT some acquaintance or some fuck of the month) Her sister is permanently going to be in her life, and since you clearly don\u2019t care to deal with her family. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s been temporarily in her life, not the other way around. Apologize, Acknowledge the mistakes you made at the time, own up to them and explain to her what you had to deal with daily because of a roommate and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll give her some insight as to why you acted crazy (lol say you have ptsd from when you lived as a 3rd wheel).  \n\nIn my book. You\u2019re the red flag not the sister. lol could\u2019ve been a one time deal, and you blew shit up way out of proportion. Hope things work out for you, if you really want to pursue a relationship.

Question \u2049\ufe0f why would you not want to meet her family? \ud83d\ude33But I do like how your concerns how you look in front of her. Wish woman was like that around other ppl man.

I think it can apply here.\n\nI think the best way forward would be to talk to her calmly and honestly about your concerns - a lot of the considerations about feeling awkward, it being a private time for you, etc. was - to our knowledge - never communicated. A lot of context from her part has not yet been communicated too, such as frequency and expectations of what to do when she is around (for e.g. making breakfast for her)\n\nI'm sure I would make a similar mistake myself, and external hindsight/perspective is typically closer to 20/20, but a more neutral sounding \"oh, we can work something out, what kind of arrangement are talking about here?\" would have made things a lot better.

You are willing to consider this but ask a question. One question. A fair question. And she BLOWS UP at you. This is NOT GOOD! To recap here - she doesn't discuss, just expects... and blows up if you have a question.\n3. I think you may want to tell GF that sister needs to stick with her current arrangement and not come to your place before school. It is a HUGE imposition on you.\n4. Tell GF her expectations and communication are causing you big concerns. Either you two can take things much slower or you can see a counselor. Or it may not be a wise idea to live together.\n5.

The GF is not going to feel welcome there and eventually if he says your sister can't come over, then she will escalate and say that his friends can't come over.\n\nHe gave a laundry list of reasons why he didn't want her there, but then claimed that none of that was part of the reason. In the end he said it was just that he doesn't want her there all the time and that none of those other reasons matter, but she hasn't even come over yet. There are no bi-weekly visits. There haven't been any visits. When she asked if her sister could come over once, he assumed it could be more than once and wanted to nip that right in the bud for fear it would become a regular thing. \n\nIf he jumps the gun like that,  he's going to quickly make his gf feel unwelcome. You can pretend that it won't happen, but it will. Heck, it already started by his own account."]}
