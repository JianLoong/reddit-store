Her sister doesn't drive yet so she goes every morning with her mom to her workplace and stays there then goes to her school.\n\nI said yes that she could come, but then I asked \"Is this going to keep happening?\" (her sister coming over in the mornings), to which she got really heated and said, \"Does that really bother you?\". I said I don't know, and she stormed off the room. \n\nI don't really know how to feel about this. I work in the afternoons so I would be there when her sister is here.\n\nI just feel it's different when we invite friends over at night to drink because I am well dressed and the house is clean for guests. But if her sister is coming over in the mornings (that's when we usually clean) I don't feel so comfortable as I am in a tank top and shorts and will have to offer her breakfast and make conversation.

This seems awkward, to have someone else in your apartment every day for so many hours.

I can imagine your gf feels nervous for her sister starting a new school as a young woman in a less than safe area, and maybe feels like she is fulfilling her role of big sis by providing hospitality and protection for her. And she might have expected you to feel the same, and is frustrated you don't have the same \"open house\" mentality.\n\nHowever, your needs matter too, and if you had to host the sister often it would be difficult for you both if you're uncomfortable with the situation.
