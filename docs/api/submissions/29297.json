We've been going out for 2 1/2 years. We've already invited friends over before to our apartment and some have even stayed the night so they don't drive drunk. For both of us it was fun to have guests as we are both furnishing our apartment and want to show it to our friends.\n\nBut today she asked me if her sister (f18) could come over at 8am and stay until around 1pm after which she will go to school. Her sister doesn't drive yet so she goes every morning with her mom to her workplace and stays there then goes to her school.\n\nI said yes that she could come, but then I asked \"Is this going to keep happening?\" (her sister coming over in the mornings), to which she got really heated and said, \"Does that really bother you?\". I said I don't know, and she stormed off the room. \n\nI don't really know how to feel about this. I work in the afternoons so I would be there when her sister is here.\n\nI just feel it's different when we invite friends over at night to drink because I am well dressed and the house is clean for guests. But if her sister is coming over in the mornings (that's when we usually clean) I don't feel so comfortable as I am in a tank top and shorts and will have to offer her breakfast and make conversation.

This seems awkward, to have someone else in your apartment every day for so many hours.  Your GF shouldn't storm off and get upset when she's asking such a big thing of you, she should be willing to hear your concerns and discuss this like an adult.  \n\nIf her sister comes over, it's not on your to entertain or feed her.  Your GF has to figure that out and work on that with her sister.  You're not TA for being uncomfortable but your GF is for not wanting to discuss this, is she usually like this?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to not feel comfortable with people other than your SO being in your space for hours on end at a time of the day that you are used to have as private time.\n\nYour GF needs to realise that just because she grew up with her sister and is probably very comfortable with having her around at whatever time, doesn\u2019t mean that you should automatically be comfortable with that too.\n\nHer storming off is pretty immature and shows an unwillingness to consider your feelings about the matter.", "NTA. It's your place and you can decide who comes over. Especially if it's every day.  All these YTA comments what fucking planet do you live on?", "NTA. Your gf is not considering this is a shared space and you have veto power. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're probably not in the US and the hospitality expectation is a cultural one.\n\nCan you compromise that she can come over 2 days a week initially to see how it goes? She can go to her moms work the other days like she does now.maybr also set expectations that your routine won't change because of her presence?", "Just tell your girlfriend \u201c your sisters hot\u201d she won\u2019t be over anymore.", "Info : what does your girlfriend thinks will happen by storming out ? That the issue will fix itself magically ?", "NTA. Normally, I'd go N-A-H, because your GF has a reasonable request and you have reasonable questions. But her getting mad and storming off like that puts her into AH territory for me.\n\nIt's both your home, and her wanting her family to come over is fair. But you not wanting one of her family members come by every day because it cramps your privacy is also fair. Adding an extra person to your household for half the day absolutely requires a conversation before it happens.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a shared home you should both get a say in who is invited over and when. When she has calmed down try and discuss it with her and explain your reasoning.", "Why is she storming out of the room over some minor communication?", "Adults discuss, children pout and storm off.

It\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s home too, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for her to want her sister to come over, and the longer your relationship lasts, the more her family should become yours and vice versa\u2026 \nThat being said, as a fellow introvert I understand wanting your peace and quiet in the morning, not wanting to have to dress appropriately in your own home and not wanting to make polite small talk first thing in the morning and play the \u201ehost role\u201c that frequently. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a compromise though. Sit down together and discuss expectations. How often will the sister come over? If she\u2019ll eat at your place, discuss showing her around the kitchen so she can help herself and you don\u2019t have to make her breakfast. Will there be any costs significant enough that you want to be compensated for them/ not have them as part of shared household costs? Can the cleaning schedule be changed? Etc\u2026 \nI\u2018m sure if you get to know her sister better you\u2019ll all become more comfortable with the situation, it\u2019ll just take some time and clear communication.", "YTA. Its your girlfriend's apartment too, and you are already throwing a fit over this happening one time. You don't have to offer her breakfast or make conversation if you don't feel like it either.

That seems pretty weird, she isn't 8  any longer.\n\nAlso,  \n\n>will have to offer her breakfast and make conversation.\n\nNo you don't and no, you don't.

You'll be there when her sister is there! Get over it. And put on some jeans and a t shirt if you are worried about how you look. You could also ask her to help clean, since she's asking for the favor of hanging out at your home. And is offering her breakfast really that big of a deal? Also, OMG YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER!! You know what? That will probably help with the fact that you don't know her well. And  your friends are the only ones treating your home like a hotel. Do you not provide them with breakfast and conversation after they actually sleep in your home?", "> will have to offer her breakfast and make conversation\n\nYou don't have to do jack squat.  You feel uncomfortable having her sister come over all the time?  Make her sister feel **really** uncomfortable when she's there.  Don't leer at her or make gross sexual comments (even though that would work very well) but you could play annoying music really loudly near her, become a close-talker, chew loudly with your mouth open, talk to her for hours about some inane topic you know she hates.
