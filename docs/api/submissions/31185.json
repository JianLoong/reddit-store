He was crushed and I took him in and since then and he\u2019s had very minimal contact with her. \n\nShe\u2019s tried reaching out to him multiple times, but my nephew simply refused contact until she broke up with his bully and cut contact with him, if not he would cut contact with her. This part may have been my fault partially due to the fact I sort of coaxed my nephew into talking to his mother face to face at her house, little did I know that his bully was there too, a fight broke out which resulted in my nephew being badly injured, after hearing what happened from a rushed explanation by my sister over the phone, I rushed down to my sisters house and demanded to know what happened, my sister practically shaking tried to explain but her boyfriend interrupted her and explained for her, I saw red when I started hearing what had happened and forcefully kicked him out of her house and told her to cut contact with him or she\u2019ll never see her son again.", "created_utc": 1700279209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xxoh0/aita_for_forcing_my_sister_to_break_up_with_her/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. You're keeping  your nephew safe from an abusive bully and neglectful mother. Keep it up. Anyone who says to \"MYOB\" can shove it. It became your business when your nephew no longer had a safe space.", "NTA\nThe only A is your sister. She's literally dating her sons bully ( who is the same age as her son \ud83e\udd2e). Her son would feel incredibly hurt and betrayed I imagine. I can't imagine how little someone would have to care about their own child to do that to them", "NTA.  You did right by your nephew,  but I think he is better off going low or no contact with his Mom whether she has the boyfriend or not.  Your sister doesn't sound like she has much maternal instinct or common sense and her judgememt is terrible.  Your nephew is better off with you.", "I don't get these Y T A votes. \n\n> told her to cut contact with him or she\u2019ll never see her son again.\n\nThat's not even your threat, that's the decision your nephew already made. You're just the messenger.", "NTA OP.  If I had a nephew and he was being bullied by someone a family member was dating, I\u2019d have no problem telling them to get rid of that person if they wanted to be in their kid\u2019s life, especially if that kid came to me for a safe space.", "NTA. Not letting your sister date a bully. Nice for sticking up for her. Also that age difference i can\u2019t really judge, my parents have a 20 year age gap", "This can't be real.\n\nSo your sister.... who's nearly 40.... is dating the guy that used to bully her son...... You you \"forced her\" to break up with him? I don't buy this for a second.", "I just stopped dead at the part where your sister is dating an underaged male. He can't even order a drink for himself in public, so what the heck is your sister thinking about? Age disparities do not bother me when people are fully invested in their adulthood. But WTH?\n\nAt any rate, about the whole dude used to bully your nephew - the penalty should be that the family doesn't ever have to interact with this guy or forgive his sins. Some stuff really is more: *You break it? You buy it!* IMO.\n\nYour sister is sleeping with her child's former tormentor? Way too Maury Povitch Show for me.\n\nNTA.", "NTA overall but YTA for coaxing him into going ALONE to his mothers house.  of course the bullybf would be there!", "NTA", "What. The. Fuck. \u2026 NTA", "She's fucking her son's bully? Fucking hell...\n\nNTA. That woman is bad news.", "NTA nobody has a right to see their kids period if she wants unconditional love then get a dog... Oh wait she's already dating one", "Your sister seems to have the maturity of a pre-teen and intelligence of a 6 year old. She dates her son's bully? What kind of rationale is that? Let alone someone who is the same age as her son. Does she hate her son that much? A fight breaks out between her son and his bully in her home (no surprise here), instead of stopping it, she calls you to clear her mess. And you gallivant over without the cops involved to do what exactly? Save your nephew? or enable your sister once more?\n\nThat said, you don't seem to be the brightest bulb around since you forced your nephew to speak with mess of your sister, instead of supporting him and respecting his boundaries. Now it is a mess and the bully dominates your sister's household since he is now her mouthpiece, instead of kicking him out you should have completely cutoff your sister and made amends with your nephew.  ESH except for the nephew.", "Sounds fake but nta. It's your nephew's choice, you're just the messenger. All actions and choices have consequences. The age gap gives me the ick. I was involved in a relationship with a huge age gap like that. I was 17 and she was 29. At the time, I thought I was the man. But now, 9 years later, she really manipulated me and was very predatory. I wouldn't be surprised if there was something similar.", "NTA your sister is gross for one dating a 20 yr old and two her son\u2019s bully that\u2019s beyond foul especially since her \u201c boyfriend \u201c beat up her son AGAIN", "NTA Your sister is horrendous. Yikes.", "NTA. Good for you sticking up for your nephew.", "In to AOP. See the thing is if you can get violent like that with your nephew as well, it\u2019s also more likely that he will also get violent with your sister. So you are not only helping out your nephew but in the end you\u2019re gonna be helping her as well.", "NTA. A bully finally screwed his victim\u2019s mother\u2026 This is insane. \n\n\nDid the nephew get beat up by this guy when he went over? If yes, did the nephew throw the first punch? If no, press charges.", "ESH\n\nYou need to get your sister some mental help. High school bullies can be anything from immature idiots to sociopaths. Just him acting the fool isn't enough to write him off. But you have absolute proof, and she is still leaning towards him.  \n\n\nWHY are the cops not involved?! WHY did you let it go this far? WHY haven't you kicked your worthless sister to the curb?!", "YTA\n\nThis is beyond ridiculous.", "ESH - except your nephew.  Look your intentions are good, but that still doesn\u2019t make what you are doing right.  First off you can\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d your sister to do anything.  How exactly do you think you can do that?  By using your nephew as a pawn?  That simply won\u2019t end well for you and is grossly unfair to him. Not to mention the fact that your egging your nephew on about talking to his mother at her house resulted in him being injured.\n\nAnd your nephew is a man now, not a boy. He has to learn to navigate difficult situations himself. You can\u2019t do that for him, and honestly your attempts to do so have done more harm than good.\n\nWhat you can do is give your nephew a safe place to heal and an empathetic but unbiased ear to listen to him as he works out his life. If her boyfriend physically attacked your nephew then encourage him to go to the police.  Encourage him to start seeing a therapist, someone Trained who could be a truly impartial sounding board for him.  If he decides to cut all contact with his mom, support his decision. But make sure it truly is his decision - not yours. There relationship sounds DOA right now, but mothers and sons aren\u2019t always rational and logical in their relationships. They may one day heal their rift and you suddenly become the unappreciated aunt who butted in. So stay as neutral as you can but support your nephew physically and emotionally.\n\nIt goes without saying mom and boyfriend are huge AH. Sounds like the boyfriend belongs in jail.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s *her* relationship not yours.  Simple as that.", "YTA\nlive your own life", "ESH except your nephew.\n\n1) Mom OBVIOUSLY sucks. While the bf is technically a consenting adult, it feels SUPER predatory for mom to be dating someone her son's age... who is also HALF her age. Yikes, red flags! Setting that aside for debate since it's all legal and consenting.... she's still an asshole because what parent chooses a new romantic partner over their CHILD?!?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Typically, I look at these and give heaping spoonfuls of doubt to the old partner. LIke, when we were talking \"high school bully\" territory, I remind people that high school sucks all around and people grow and change. I wouldn't want to be judged for the person I was at 20 or 21, let alone in high school... but given that high school was like, not even 3 years ago for this guy it's probably much safer to say that he is STILL a bully - especially as it doesn't seem like he offered any type of apology for how he treated the son OR any kind of normal-person remorse and awkwardness upon realizing his new girlfriend is his former classmate's MOM so yeah he sucks too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) That being said... You\u2019re a SOFT SOFT everyone sucks for forcing the mom to break up. That's going to cause resentment all around for everyone without actually solving any issues. You're AMAZING for taking in our nephew and I wouldn't have given an ESH if that was the story's end... but you can't force a grown adult to make adult decisions if they don't want to act like an adult. Taking that option away might remove the bully from the situation but your nephew is going to know forever that his mom chose someone else over him. That's permanent becasue you removed her opportunity to eventually realize her actions are fucked and apologize to her kid. Now, she's never going to see for herself that what she did was wrong so it won't be learned. So for that - soft you kinda suck too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
