When he came from work, his wife, who was a SAHM (or on maternity leave) needed him to take the baby right away because she was tired and frustrated and needed a few moments of quiet time. But this particular day he had lost a patient and was very emotionally affected, so he just couldn't deal with a screaming baby right away. His wife, on the other hand, who didn't know what had happened at his work place, was angry that he didn't just help her with their child.\n\nIt was a very touching post, I think, with no one being the asshole. Just two people in a stressful situation with different needs, who needed to communicate more.\n\nEdit: Found it, thanks! https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uj4q9t/aita_for_snapping_at_my_wife_and_asking_her_for_5/", "[The teddy bear stuffed with human hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t92zju/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_a_stuffed_bear_filled/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "~~[That one where the guy was scared his girlfriend was gonna get rabies from a friendly dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1048gbb/wibta_if_i_told_my_gf_to_get_checked_for_rabies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)~~\n\nSo deliciously unhinged\n\nEDIT: This is from this year oops", "[AITA for filing a noise complaint about a single mom with a newborn](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v17nkb/aita_for_filing_a_noise_complaint_about_a_single/)?", "I second this one (I nominated it for Most Difficult Decision).", "What about [AITA for not wanting to go to my wife\u2019s deceased husband\u2019s family\u2019s house for Thanksgiving?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2m7ss/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_wifes_deceased/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "Yeah this one was awful.  I don't know why people expect that current partners need to engage with former partners families,  no matter how the relationship ended.\n\nYes the kids should know their bio grandparents.  That doesn't mean OP has to go sit thru a holiday with his current wife's former partners family. \n\nAnd who did she actually make the commitment too about this? Personally I think the lives of the living matter more than anything else.  She should be prioritizing her current husband over former in laws.   That is what they are.   Former in laws.   She should be getting to know her current in laws.\n\n\nAnd it is creepy and morbid.  The guy is dead.  Op is never going to meet him, know him, participate in any conversations , nothing.  Why would the in laws want him there? Why do the kids want him there? And why does the wife want him there? \n\nIt reeks of \"they were here first so suck it up\".\n\nIf this kinda shit was non negotiable she should have brought it up before they got married.  On no planet would I be ok with this.", "This one may have been voted NAH, but with both these new parents dragging *their* parents into their argument, this is definitely ESH. I\u2019ll never understand why so many people want their family involved in their marriage like that.", "Oh damn. Wait. So did OP ever elaborate on whether this is a sizeable toy literally stuffed only and entirely with hair? Or if it\u2019s like, a small little bear meant to be a momento with a bag of hair contained within nicer fluffy stuffing?", "Oh god this is so gross but how the judgement was NTA?", "Is this the one you're thinking of?

It\u2019s not her just dead husbands parents, that\u2019s her living children\u2019s family. Most people do expect some level of family blend when they marry a person with children from a prior relationship. It\u2019s definitely not weird or morbid to ask your husband to spend a holiday with you. She\u2019s not asking him to spend time with the grandparents. It\u2019s her, her children, and their family, which to an extent would and should be his family too.", "I don\u2019t find it that morbid, though I fully support OP\u2019s right to opt out. Ex may be dead but he\u2019s still the children\u2019s father. They\u2019re all trying to make the best of a difficult situation. I see a husband trying to be understanding, a wife trying to keep her deceased ex\u2019s memory alive for his kids, and former in-laws warmly welcoming OP into their lives. I can understand all of those positions on some level. If wife refused to take no for an answer or if the in-laws spent the entire time making OP feel inferior, it would change my view though.", "He doesn't mention losing the patient in the initial post, haven't read all the comments yet to find any INFOs. In spite of that, it seems to fit.\n\nI've spent the whole afternoon looking for the post believe it or not", "Thanksgiving is the major holiday for a lot of Americans, bigger than Christmas. It's a bit of a dick move to unilaterally decide two other branches of the kids' grandparents can never enjoy a Thanksgiving with the 'whole family.'\n\nAn actual compromise would be that they get at least one annual visit, and and at least one third of the thanksgivings. She can donate her parents' third to her late-husbands parents too.", "But she\u2019s not there at his parents. He\u2019s not there at her Thanksgiving. In a blended family, no one gets to have their \u201cfull family\u201d at any one holiday. It\u2019s the way he has framed this situation in his mind that makes his the AH to me. He keeps referring to this family as her late husbands but they are his living children\u2019s grandparents. Do they not deserve their whole family there? He doesn\u2019t have to go but I understand why she asked and she set her plans and she\u2019s allowed to do that.", "Oh you're absolutely right, sort by last year failed me my bad", "Also suspended account, but I think this was actually the one they were thinking of: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uj4q9t/aita_for_snapping_at_my_wife_and_asking_her_for_5/\n\nEdit: [bot copy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uj4q9t/aita_for_snapping_at_my_wife_and_asking_her_for_5/i7gmcve)", "This exactly.

He even wrote that the bear is sawn good enough that the hair can't get out, so no bag. \n\nI also found it as a joke that he thinks the tradition is so important but he lost his hair-bear when he moved.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s morbid for the wife and kids, but I can see how it could feel that way for OP. One of the \u201cYTA\u201d commenters told OP that to the grandparents, he\u2019s likely a walking reminder that their son is dead. Being in that position would feel pretty morbid to me.", "That\u2019s fair. OP is certainly NTA for feeling that way but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling anyone else an asshole for trying either.", "Definitely. No assholes, just people trying to do their best in a tough situation.", "It\u2019s WILD to me how many adults seem to drag their friends and relatives into their private business. People\u2019s in-laws and parents and siblings and other friends are always texting them to weigh in on why they were the asshole. I do NOT have this relationship with my family, and I would say we\u2019re all pretty close.
