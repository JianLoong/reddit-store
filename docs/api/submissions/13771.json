I have my basic needs taken care of, and my parents don't hit me or tell me extremely demoralizing things. I would characterize my relationship with my family as distant.\n\nMy mom is one of those annoying parents that airs out her grievances nonstop. She had constantly been nagging me about how bad and blemished my skin is, how much acne and how many red marks I have, etc. Just in general, whenever I converse with her (which is not that often because again, my family isn't close), she has to fit in some complaint.\n\nOne day, we were about to go for a dentist checkup, waiting for the car to warm up. She decided it was the ideal time to complain - she started moaning about how the doctors at that quack office fucked up my teeth and that she shouldn't have shelled out 2k for braces. A few seconds later, she looked in the car mirror, made an annoying clucking sound with her mouth, and told me that my skin looked like ass. That infuriated me. I flipped her off because I was fucking tired of all her nagging. In return, she got mad and cancelled the doctor's appointment.\n\nWe had a shouting match inside the house. Long story short, I told her in order to stop her complaining about my ugly, pimple-ridden face, I wouldn't be speaking to her. On top of that, I'd wear a mask inside the house whenever she's home.\n\nFyi, I do take care of my skin. I wash my face with cleanser and all that skincare jazz, and it DOES help me. However, my mom tells me that using skincare products will do nothing for me and they're actually harming my skin. I'm not taking hygiene tips from a person who washes their hair with scalding hot water daily and has straw on their scalp. Before this particular incident, I asked if she would like to take me to a dermatologist to fix my skin. Just like skincare products and my dentist, she didn't believe in the medical treatment of the certified skincare specialists.\n\nIt's been two weeks. I haven't talked to her since the argument conspired, and I've stuck to my promise of wearing masks inside the house.

It sounds like your mum might be in a similar sort of boat.
