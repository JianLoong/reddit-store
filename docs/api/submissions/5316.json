You have to veto to save your child from years of bullying, resentment towards you both, and the huge pain in the butt of them changing their name legally when they turn 18.\n\nWhy does she hate this child already?", "NTA. That is a ridiculous name. Your reaction is exactly the reaction your child will get...every time he tells anyone his name.  She needed to see that. \n\nAnd yes, he will be tormented into the ground with a name like that. Might as well have [a boy named Sue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOHPuY88Ry4)", "NTA that is too Kardashian for normal", "NTA\n\nYou need to sit your wife down and find out \\*why\\* she thinks this is the perfect name.   Then you can work on changing her mind.", "Here I was thinking, \"How bad can it be?\"", "Nta, names are important. I have a \"unique\" first name and ended up being the butt of the joke for far too long. Eventually resulting in me despising my first name.", "NTA. Nothing screams \u201cI\u2019m heavily influenced by celebrity baby names\u201d than this combination of names.", "NTA. My husband and I had an agreement if it was boy, he could pick. Girl was me. But we both had to agree on the name. Our first was a boy. He picked. I loved it. Second was a girl. Same thing. The key is we both agreed on the name. \n\nAnd I think Saint Prince is ridiculous. I\u2019d have laughed too. I would never actually think anyone who wasn\u2019t a Kardashian would actually be serious about that name.", "NTA. It was a reflex reaction to a silly name, especially considering she liked all the other regular suggestions you had for the other kids. If my previous kids all had names like (just spitballing here) Abigail, Sophia, and Elizabeth, and my SO liked those names enough to agree to them to name out kids then threw out a couple random words that aren't names as a name for a kid I would think they were joking too.  I would apologize for laughing but still not agree to those words as names for my kid.", "She won\u2019t snap out of it, you need to sit down with her and explain to her that you don\u2019t like her name suggestion and why but please do it gently", "We all laughed at that name and I'm still laughing, lol NTA, I really hope for the kid she reconsiders hahaha", "NTA. \n\nYour laugh is a good indication to her of what such a child will face in their life.", "NTA, laughing was a natural and understandable reaction. Better that you're the one laughing once than all the kid's classmates throughout their school years.", "First, the name is awful. I probably would have laughed too.\n\nCurious. Are all the names of late relatives from your side?", "NTA life will be brutal for him. I hope you are right with the hormones. My parents were going to name me Linwood if I had been a male. I cringe thinking about that. Then there would be the nicknames..nope glad I am (f).  I hope your wife comes up with more normal name.", "NTA when someone says \u201cI wanna name my baby Saint Prince\u201d the only realistic reaction, in my opinion, is to assume it\u2019s a joke. Laugh away but please don\u2019t let her name your kid something so utterly ridiculous.", "NAH. \n\nBe honest but be the right amount of honest. Try to be sensitive to her feelings. Apologize for laughing and explain it caught you off guard. But do admit you shouldn\u2019t have laughed even if it was accidental. \n\n\n\nAlso maybe say that having one name that sticks out may be upsetting for the kids. Either your older three may be jealous the new baby gets a unique name, or when the baby gets older he may be resentful that he\u2019s the only one with a unique name. \n\nBut IMO let go of the middle name having to be after a family member.", "I gotta be honest, I would have laughed too all the way till I was around 15 and then I would just laugh inside. But in my country uncommon names is against the law so I never stumbled upon anyone called prince other than our prince whose royal \nNTA", "NTA \n\n\\- for laughing lol I would too, that does sound like a joke.\n\n\\- for not  telling her how ridiculous it is right now...she is hormonal and may feel terrible (likely will) if ridiculed.\n\n\\- do make sure to intervene after the baby is born -the hospital to not do the birth paperwork until BOTH of you sign off on the name.\n\nn a h considering you think she'd normally not suggest something like this. I would think y t a if you knew she would do something like this and waited for it lol", "Nah but dont allow that name for god\u2019s sake. Kid will be bullied mercilessly. Maybe have a rule that she hast to pick a book for my baby name book. Or a baby name website. Not a dictionary.", "NAH You don't like the name, she does. Just a difference in naming style and preference.\n\nJust tell her you don't like it. If kids want to pick on a kid, they'll find a reason \"plain\" name or not.", "Is she a kardashian? NTA!", "YTA, just for laughing at your wife. Help look for a nice compromise like Saint John or just Prince (which is obviously not an uncommon name). \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with an unusual name. It\u2019s better than being the 4th Aiden in class.", "NTA-It sounds like the name of a street or a porn star name. I\u2019d have laughed too. \n\n\nMaybe ask why she likes those titles for a name and you could work together to find names that have similar meanings.", "NTA. When it comes to baby names..both parents should agree. You kinda messed up when you said she could pick it herself. That meant she could pick *anything* and boy did she. I do think he will get picked on, it\u2019s a crazy name", "YTA, but not a big AH obviously.\n\nJust maybe bursting out in laughter wasn't the most politically correct reply and it probably made her feel bad, specially considering how crazy hormones are in her body right now.", "You can dislike it, but yeah YTA for laughing. Obviously you should both like the name, but you made her feel bad about the suggestion instead of just articulating why you didn't like it. \n\nAs a side note, I work in a school. Saint Prince is one of the more tame names. And not just with the kids. We had a parent whose first name was Sir. Just Sir. \n\nNames really aren't a cause for bullying. Not as much as even a few decades ago. It's perfectly normal to have odd names, character names, names spelled way different, names from other languages, cultures, etc. Walking down my building, seeing all the names on lockers, would make you feel better about Saint Prince so fast lol. \n\nAlso, I got made fun of as a kid for my super standard name that tons of people have. Seriously, there is no rhyme or reason. Don't use bullying as the excuse, because kids pick the stupidest things to bully over and most the bullies are named much stranger things than Saint Prince lol.\n\nEdit to add: to those people saying N T A because they would have or did laugh...you are the people who would bully the kid for their name. Adults are the issue here. Not other kids. Wow.", "YTA for your reaction, both of you should agree on a name, work together on ideas or get your wife to shortlist say ten names she likes and the both of you make final decision together.", "She needs to stop watching the Kardashians! LoL\nI'm going to go with a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery soft YTA because you laughed at her face and that is a little mean. I get it, the name is bad (really bad,) but laughing at her while pregnant us hurtful.", "YTA. Solely for laughing at her name suggestion. \n\nKids names are a two yes situation, if one parent isn\u2019t on board, that name is scrapped.", "Oof,  although I am in agreement with you on your dislike of the name Saint Prince, and I would agree that it could totally be used againt them by schoolyard bullies. I still feel that YTA (albeit a mild one),  you said she could pick. Perhaps further discussion could have been beneficial.  \nI constantly joke with my partner about naming our future child \"Wing Commander\" (Dub C for short) but if she were to actually get pregnant and I asked to pick the name, I feel names she deemed unacceptable would be a topic we would discuss. \nGood Luck!", "YYA. For laughing. You can disagree, but you shouldn't have laughed.", "NTA - I'd laugh too, and I agree -this kid will get bullied. I'd approach this through your wife's family/friends - if enough people tell her this name is going to make the kid's life hard, she will likely re-think things.", "ESH \n\n\nThe \"you picked the last 3 so I pick this one,\" (and you agreeing) makes me wonder how on board she actually was with the names for your daughters. I also wonder if there's some gender bias going on here, like she didn't care as much about the girl names, but this is her little Saint/Prince boy. \n\n\nBaby names should always be discussions.

I'd love to see the data on name change requests separated by things like standard spelling vs. Nonstandard. Or common vs. Uncommon. Would be interesting to see what the actual breakdown is. \n\nThe fact is, no parent knows if their kid will love or hate the name. An ordinary name might be great for one kid and loathed by another. I gave my kid an out there kind of name but made sure he had initials that were a much more standard name.
