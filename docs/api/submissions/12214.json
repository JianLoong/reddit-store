I was awkward and uncomfortable in my own skin. \n\nMy brother's could do no wrong in our parents' eyes. I was the little weird girl that just wanted to sit in the corner and read.  \n\nI was mostly ignored when they weren't actively trying to mock me. It seemed like all of my other relatives would join in. Except for my grandfather. He would tell them to leave me alone and let me go to the garage with him to avoid other people. \n\nBut because I was so quiet and ignored everyone said everything around me like I wasn't there.  \n\nI finally met a guy that my family does not intimidate. He is that guy from Practical Magic. The perfect guy, for me, that I never thought could exist. And we are getting married.  \n\nI already we had a big engagement dinner because my parents asked if they could throw one and we agreed. \n\nThe only stipulation was that everyone has to know that I would be responding to every speech or toast that was meant to bring up my past or embarrass me. I was fine with congratulations and nice stories. \n\nMy parents and siblings already know I'm serious because they were my test subjects. When I brought my fiance to meet the family my brother told him the story of when we went camping and I peed myself because they convinced me that there were bears between the tent and the bathroom. I followed up with the story of our first family vacation in Mexico where he shit his pants because he was a big boy who could buy tequila if he wanted.  \n\nHe was very upset. My other brother tried his luck to the same effect. That is more personal and I won't be telling it here.  \n\nMy mom said I was being a jerk bringing up embarrassing stories. I asked her if she had any stories she wanted to share with my fiance. She thought about it and decided to tell about when I got my first horse and how happy I was.  See they can be taught. \n\nSo at the party I was ready with everyone's stories. I guess my parents were very clear with everyone because almost all the stories were nice and lovely memories of my time growing up. One of my cousins decided to test my resolve by talking about how unattractive I was in high school. I had bad acne breakouts. I got up and thanked her for her speech and I said that I wish I could have been attractive like her. After all she did manage to get with three guys and gets child support from all three. \n\nShe ran out. It kind of put a damper on the event. \n\nMy aunt called me an asshole for bringing that up. I asked her if she wanted me to make a speech about her? She left. \n\nI am done taking shit from these people and I do not feel like an asshole for treating them like they treat me.", "created_utc": 1678736424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qjchz/aita_for_bringing_up_everyones_embarassing/", "score": 345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
