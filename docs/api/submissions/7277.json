Only you are able to judge the value.\n\nSome things I want to point out:\n\n1. If you are having issues with your son responding to you and keeping close, a great opportunity to get close is to spend a playoff game mutually cheering together and a lifelong memory.  This seems to be a pro-ticket as opposed to an anti-ticket argument.\n2. 4x football ticket price is a lot of money.  Is it worth it compared to the fact your son will now see every time the Eagles mentioned as that time his dad chose the money over him.  \n3.  80-90% chance you have lost this common connection to him.  If you guys have a lot of other things to bond over great, this isn't a big loss.

You put yourself in this bind by telling them about the tickets and selling them.  Information no one needed to know.  This is what happens when people have to share instantaneously without thinking it through.\n\nSon will be angry but you know what he wasn\u2019t happy to begin with.

I always sat and watched it with him over the weekends on tv.\n\nHe took my cousin. \n\nOn my 21st birthday he promised there would be a family get-together and a small party, which is tradition in his family for that kind of birthday. He totally ghosted me and went to another cousins 21st instead. That neither me or my siblings received an invitation to. \n\nI remember those 20+ years on. He calls us every few months to let us know we are always welcome at his and to ask when he might see us next. \n\nWe aren\u2019t in a hurry to make a 6 - 8 hr round trip to where he lives now.", "Personally I think this is why the movie the wrestler with Mickey rourke was so good. It shows you how he didn\u2019t mean to disappoint his daughter but he did and he did fuck up, but it wasn\u2019t intentional. He was still in the wrong but you see how life fucks you up sometimes.", "At about the same age, our dad drove to the next state to visit us, but mum wouldn't let him take us out to lunch because it was the Sabbath. He promised he'd take us the next day.\n\nHe didn't. \n\nI have very few memories from that time, and it took me years to piece it together. For all I know, he was there waiting the next day, but we were packed into a car in the middle of the night and moved across the country.\n\nI blamed him for years.", "You should go now and send your dad a picture of you on a horse flipping him off. Idk if he was a good dad overall or not, but that was a promise he should have kept.", "He wasn't divorcing you, but his wife. That's just a crap justification.\n\nTaking out issues you have with your spouse on your kids is one of the worst things you can do as a parent.", "Yeah it's not like there were only 2 tickets for that (still wouldn't have been ok wtf)", "Yeah,  my dad would drop anything to go help his siblings or their kids, which is great but my siblings and my mum always came second. \n\nHe once asked why I couldn\u2019t be more like my (favourite) cousin. \n\nI guess it\u2019s my fault that I don\u2019t  live in an affluent area, I\u2019m not allowed  to leave the house to see friends, I don\u2019t get to take after school classes, restricted to sharing a bath once a week and there is nothing in my wardrobe that is new or that even fits me properly. \n\nBecause I\u2019m sure that those things do absolutely zero to mould a child\u2019s personality and social skills, I\u2019m sure you can just convince yourself you were raised well if you really try \u2026", "That really sucks. I\u2019m sorry.", "I\u2019m a Packers fan, born & bred - Rodgers deserves whatever shit you throw at/blame him for!", "My dad would borrow $100 then pay me on tuesday when he got unemployment during covid.\n\nOne week he said his unemployment got stoppes for an investigation or w.e...3 weeks later i phone up my mom and ask her if his unemployment was fixed..it never had a problem and hes just blowing it all at a casino and on beer/weed.\n\nI didnt really care about them before and didnt speak to them for 6 years so i was going to just block them and then my dad randomly showed up to my house an apologized then left. Turns out my mom gave him $600 to pay us but he took the money and bought dabs.\n\nSucks hes never going to see us again or meet his new granddaughter and we have another on the way. Cant wait to fucking move to a different state, my address is the only thing they know about me.\n\nAlso before anyone tries to defend my mom, she chooses to stay with him knowong he use to beat the shit out of her 3 kids and did absolutely nothing until he took a blow torch to her face.", "Yes but also works isn\u2019t controllable and more understandable than just bonus extra money. Even so, a real attempt to make up for it would go a long way.", "Apparently OP's 'can't help but sell' price is 5x his investment. I'm guessing not much more than he spent on the tickets", "How much are we talking? I have some extras...", "Apparently if someone offered him 5x what he paid for the kid, it would be irresponsible not to sell him!", "This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n#Removal random fact: Antwerp was the first host of the Olympics after WWI.\r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "You: hey Reddit, I\u2019m posting on this sub which is infamous for giving brutal (but honest) judgment. Am I the AH for making my kid a pretty big promise and letting him down by not keeping it? \n\nAITA: Yes, yes you are. (Note: You being TA does not automatically mean you\u2019re the AH in all aspects of your life or you\u2019re some scum of the Earth. Some of AITA tends to overstep their boundaries and make assumptions about people\u2019s personal lives, whether or not that\u2019s justified.)\n\nYou: Nah F that, I\u2019m a great dad and I\u2019m going to argue. \n\nLike why? Either you didn\u2019t give information/context that makes you N T A (ex. Your kid stole your car and went for a joyride, so now he\u2019s grounded and no Eagles tickets >> you\u2019re N T A), or YTA and just can\u2019t accept it.", "How can people defend OP xD honestly I\u2019ve seen some comments that says money is more important but no wtffff your child first !!", "I was also a huge eagles fan when I was younger.  My dad bought tickets and actually took me. I wouldn't trade that moment with my dad for anything.  It was amazing.\n\nThis deadbeat ripped away one of the best memories and bonding moments a kid could ever share with their father.  And all for a few sheckles.", "There's a saying for this: the tree remembers, the axe forgets. OP will probably forget what they did with the money their boss gave them for the tickets, but their son will absolutely never forget it.", "I\u2019m pretty convinced the majority of these posts that hit the main page are all fake. People are pretty much telling stories like \u2018my wife said something silly so I took a shit in the oven then murdered our dog. She thinks I over reacted but my second cousin said I didn\u2019t do enough. They suggested I should have released a pack of rabid orangutans at the local preschool. Who is the asshole in this situation?!\u2019 And you dumb motherfuckers can\u2019t help but rush in to brigade on some absolute nonsense. It\u2019s fucking hilarious honestly.", ">Is this real?\n\nMan, I ask myself this all the time, especially in subs like this that encourage... Interesting stories.\n\n\"I made a promise to my son, told him I was fulfilling the promise, then intentionally failed to fulfill the promise. AITA?\"\n\nGimme a break.", "Exactly. Obviously this is very exciting for the kid but... why is no one focusing on the fact that this should have been such an exciting opportunity for OP too? Like, seeing a playoff game with his son. Boom, best day ever", ">Some info needed but you make it sound like his excitement irritated you,\n\nYeah, I'd like to get more info on the \"issues with him texting me back\". Is OP annoyed that his son texts him back? Like, replies to his texts? Wtf?", "My old man promised to take me caving with him. He bought us second hand gear and wet suits and the hype was real like two weeks prior. His friend end who was a caving instructor  was very keen to have us along for the day. \nNight before the caving comes up, old. Man tells me to get my stuff packed and get a good night's sleep so we can be up early to drive.\n\nI'm up early ready to go and full of beans. Go to wake him up. He gets angry and says because I woke him up and pissed him off were not going any more.\nHe had been drinking until 4am and it's 6.30am. We had to be out the door by 7am.\n\nI was fucking crushed. 9am rolls around and his friend rings me and is like:\n\"hey where are you guys?\" \n\nSorry dad said we can't go now. \n\n\"Well I wish he had fucking told me because I booked out my entire day for you two when I had three other groups try and book me for the tour too... The fuck? \"\n\nSorry I really wanted to be there but dad said no this morning.\n\nMy dad's phone rings and I then get in even bigger shit for a telling his friend the truth.\n\n\nMan, he did the same shit when I wanted to go fishing with him. We bought rods and  bait and he hyped me up about it for a week straight, I was so excited to spend time with him and learn a new skill. Cancels on me the morning of and tells me he fucking hates fishing.", "This comment just got me for sure. When I was young my dad said every year that he would bring me to a wrestling match. We never went. \n\nI'm just now realizing that, even as a little kid, it wasn't about the wrestling. It was just one of the few things we bonded over and I wanted to spend time with him doing something we both enjoyed.\n\nThis was over 25 years ago. I still remember it.", "As a daughter of a hardcore 28+ year fan of EAGLES, i can concur that is very true", "And this guy is annoyed that his son \"has trouble texting him back\". Doesn't he see that he's already on the way to his son cutting contact with him?", "I only see mine at family gatherings, like a distant uncle. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing like the pain of having a parent who doesn\u2019t give two shits about your feelings.

I\u2019m almost crying over her actions", "Your mom is an absolute sweetheart. This melted my heart, awe.", "Same happened to me and my sister too.

We never did go.", ">I'm a deadbeat father who constantly disappoints his kid.\n\nAt least he's self aware.", "He needs to give the profits to his son.", "This song ALWAYS gave me chills.", "Bc it's not the best day ever to do that with his son. \n\nIt's best day ever to make a profit on the tickets. \n\nThat's what he literally chose lol", "I'm so sorry you were treated like that. You didn't deserve it. You deserve someone who loves you and wants to spend quality bonding time with you and build a relationship with you.", "Yea, just cant understand that. What else would you spend that extra profit on that's better than that day", "I saw that tour in ATX. Having been a huge Weezer fan since I(40) was 13, it was a must-see for me.

My parents split when I was five I am 46 now and I\u2019ve seen him 16 times, I was in my 30\u2019s last time I saw him and went NC. But after my parents divorce he only saw me maybe ten times. All his choice. So he needs to understand when his son is older he may realize he\u2019s not his dad\u2019s priority and go LC or NC and OP will only have his self to blame.", "I believe the term for this is theft.", "My first thought was the Alessia Cara song, and then the Oingo Boingo one.\n\nThere may just be too many songs called \"Stay\".", "Yeah it took me a moment to figure it out too but its about the lyrics so I worked it out", "Wow! Well she at least wasn\u2019t complicit in the affair and sounds like she\u2019d be understanding that the ring is your inheritance. She already knows your dad was a liar if he omitted a whole marriage."]}
