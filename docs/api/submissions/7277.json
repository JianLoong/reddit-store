I think its hard to judge the value of money.  Different people have different circumstances and who I am to be able to judge those.  Only you are able to judge the value.\n\nSome things I want to point out:\n\n1. If you are having issues with your son responding to you and keeping close, a great opportunity to get close is to spend a playoff game mutually cheering together and a lifelong memory.  This seems to be a pro-ticket as opposed to an anti-ticket argument.\n2. 4x football ticket price is a lot of money.  Is it worth it compared to the fact your son will now see every time the Eagles mentioned as that time his dad chose the money over him.  \n3.  80-90% chance you have lost this common connection to him.  If you guys have a lot of other things to bond over great, this isn't a big loss.

You put yourself in this bind by telling them about the tickets and selling them.  Information no one needed to know.  This is what happens when people have to share instantaneously without thinking it through.\n\nSon will be angry but you know what he wasn\u2019t happy to begin with.
