By that time their little airways aren't so tiny and overall they are better at regulating themselves and not in danger of positional asphyxiation every time they move. Best practice is always safest though, and your partner should be more mindful. \n\nThe changing table is another story. There are exactly 0 appropriate times to have baby on the changing table without at least one hand on them, let alone walking away. Literally everything you set a baby on that they arent strapped down in has huge warning labels stating DO NOT LEAVE BABY UNATTENDED because baby will fall off. If baby is rolling over now, soon they will be crawling and can't be left on the changing table for even a second. \n\nHowever, no amount of yelling, nagging, or hand wringing is going to keep baby safer.

A fall from a changing table can seriously harm an infant, and babies get to moving fast really quickly.

My little boy has been rolling over since he was 4 months old. My baby is now 6 months old and I can't even use a changing table as he moves around far too much when trying to change his diaper. He rolls, he half turns away and does 360s constantly. I think the floor is the best option tbh.\n\nAs for the muslin clothes in the crib, that's a BIG NO NO. God Im actually worried for your baby's safety, I had to stop writing this for a moment to go check I haven't left anything near my baby in his crib (I haven't and I never do but still I had to go check on him).

Though it seems your infant is almost past the point where you need to worry about the burp cloths, it seems like a very minor ask that your spouse needs to respect. \n\nRegarding the changing table they are absolutely being irresponsible. My toddler is 2.5, has never tried to roll (or jump lol) off the changing table and I left him unattended a week ago and he fell off. He\u2019s totally fine (bc he is a rough and tumble toddler) but I felt awful and it freaked me out imagining him doing that as an infant.", "Wtf is a burp cloth", "NTA aside from burying the lede.

Putting a trigger warning of \u201cpossible infant death\u201d is ridiculous enough. That told me more than anything else you wrote. \n\nYour request is not crazy. You are right, there is a possibility of suffocation or rolling over,etc. But if this is your reaction to burp towels laid about and leaving the kid on the changing table for a minute, you need to calm down. \n\nIt\u2019s good you want to protect your child, and I support that greatly. But you also sound psycho. \u201cPossible infant death\u201d - are you using your child as clickbait?", "As a parent, having raised our kid, being protective is normal. Being a jerk to your partner can also be normal in situations, especially early on.  As babies don't come with an instruction manual, we all have to learn what works.  But as a couple you have to do the same.  Babies change a lot of dynamics. \n\n2 things I'll offer.  \n\n1) be willing to apologize to your partner.  \n2) be willing to be wrong.\n\n\nKids will get hurt, and sometimes, there is nothing you can do.  You can do everything everyone tells you and run yourself into the ground, and something awful can still happen. Being a parent, you need to come to terms with that.  Doesn't mean you don't try, but you need to focus on meaningful, not everything.  Recognize your partner is doing a risk assessment just like you do but prioritize that differently.  Doesn't mean there isn't love or care.  \n\nNAH", "First thing: as a parent I feel you.

I would be seriously asking them why this particular hill is the one they want to \"die on\" so to speak. What's the root cause of their resistance to this? Is it a passive aggressive stab at you? If so, why put the baby in danger? Just put it out there that they may resent your oversight or that you question their parenting, or whatever the hell it is. Is it a response rooted in ignorance?

As well as the fact that I told my spouse what they're doing could possibly kill our child. I don't disagree that their actions could kill our child but I feel like an ass for saying it to my partner as I know it is a hurtful thing to hear.", "None of that means it's okay to leave your baby alone on a changing table", "Naw, man. You don't leave a baby unattended on a changing table. It very well could roll off and die. It's rare, but it's happened. OP has a right to call that negligent shit out. \n\nNTA. \n\nNormally I'd be against spouses yelling at one another, but this is about the *physical life of their child.*", "What the fuck kind of mindset is this? \"You can't plan for absolutely every type of situation so don't even bother following basic safety procedures.\" \n\nA baby rolling off of a changing table isn't a wild, hypothetical scenario, it's something that just happens pretty often when basic precautions aren't followed.", "You realize how fast babies can roll don\u2019t you??", "The burp cloths are left in or on top of the crib while the baby is sleeping. Which is anywhere from 1-12 hours. \n\nThe baby rolling off the changing table in 30-60 seconds is a separate concern. \n\nNot that it is any of your business but I am under the care of a mental health professional as is my spouse for their own mental health struggles(which before you go accusing me) started before we were together.", "OP isn't the one whose level of concern is unreasonable here.", "No, the burp cloth is left in the crib where the baby sleep. \nAlso you can't plan for a pitbull attacking a baby, you can howver plan on how you secure your home for a baby.\nI know you're not OP and you didn't ask but YTA.\n\nI don't have or want kids but I do have common sense.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You can't and shouldn't hover over them all the time. As long as they are in a secure crib with nothing they can suffocate themselves with, they are perfectly fine. Of course a baby monitor is also a good idea. When I put my baby down for a nap the absolute last thing I'm going to do is sit there staring at him and waiting for him to wake up.", "Yeah NTA since you tried being nice. I\u2019d still try to be calm about it, but very firm and very serious. Do not belittle them or talk down to them as much as possible, but be stern and pragmatic. Not emotional, factual. If that makes sense.\n\nBut yeah, if they can\u2019t figure this out, their feeings may be the least of y\u2019all\u2019s concerns. Good luck <3", "Was your spouse present for that conversation with the pediatrician? If not, then make sure they are there with you for the next appointment and have the discussion again.

(He was saved by rolling straight into the side table. I don't think we would have managed to catch him)  She was out of the room for maybe two minutes? We were 9 and 5 and did not tell her haha, we just moved him back in place and pretended nothing happened.  Babies will roll! You have to be ready!", "Honestly babies are full of surprises.  About the time you think oh they won\u2019t do that for another month or so they do it.  I found that out babysitting as a teen when one rolled off a changing table on my watch.  I was absolutely terrified he was gonna get a brain bleed and die. I have been very cautious with babies laying on anything elevated without sides since.", "Thank you, I knew there was a term, but I couldn't remember it", "I was asking them to clarify if it was the baby or burp cloth on the changing table.", "I never said the OP was wrong or that leaving anything in the crib was safe\u2026", "And they left in the crib being the problem the baby could grab and suffocate right?", "I agree with that statement, but tell me how this story has any involvement with anything NEAR infant death? Comparing your spouse leaving burp towels around the house to \u201cpossible infant death\u201d is like comparing a paper cut to a \u201cpossible amputation. It sounds crazy.", "And nothing I wrote says that.  I'll light a flame for your gaslighting.", "No, absolutely. I was clarifying what it appeared OP said. And then went on with the rest of what I wanted to say. And forgot to put in a judgement <headdesk>.", "The changing table thing is definitely putting the baby at risk for serious injury or death.", "Because the post openly talks about an infant possibly dying and the conversation under the post is also talking about infants dying.\n\nOP also did not just say their partner just leaves burp towels around the house. They are left in the crib, and it's pretty universally regarded as dangerous to leave burp towels in a child's crib. There have also been plenty of cases where children left unattended roll off of their changing table and die or are seriously injured, which is also in this post."]}
