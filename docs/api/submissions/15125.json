By that time their little airways aren't so tiny and overall they are better at regulating themselves and not in danger of positional asphyxiation every time they move. Best practice is always safest though, and your partner should be more mindful. \n\nThe changing table is another story. There are exactly 0 appropriate times to have baby on the changing table without at least one hand on them, let alone walking away. Literally everything you set a baby on that they arent strapped down in has huge warning labels stating DO NOT LEAVE BABY UNATTENDED because baby will fall off. If baby is rolling over now, soon they will be crawling and can't be left on the changing table for even a second. \n\nHowever, no amount of yelling, nagging, or hand wringing is going to keep baby safer.

A fall from a changing table can seriously harm an infant, and babies get to moving fast really quickly.  As others have recommended, moving the changing table setup so the baby is not left alone is essential.  Whether that's moving the changing table, buying another trash bin for diapers, or getting your spouse to start changing the baby on the floor/something they can't roll off of, it doesn't matter, but for that piece, you have the right of it.", "NTA.

My little boy has been rolling over since he was 4 months old. My baby is now 6 months old and I can't even use a changing table as he moves around far too much when trying to change his diaper. He rolls, he half turns away and does 360s constantly. I think the floor is the best option tbh.\n\nAs for the muslin clothes in the crib, that's a BIG NO NO. God Im actually worried for your baby's safety, I had to stop writing this for a moment to go check I haven't left anything near my baby in his crib (I haven't and I never do but still I had to go check on him).

I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the burp cloth, although your partner should definitely be more careful.", "NTA. Safe sleep practices exist for a reason. Though it seems your infant is almost past the point where you need to worry about the burp cloths, it seems like a very minor ask that your spouse needs to respect. \n\nRegarding the changing table they are absolutely being irresponsible. My toddler is 2.5, has never tried to roll (or jump lol) off the changing table and I left him unattended a week ago and he fell off. He\u2019s totally fine (bc he is a rough and tumble toddler) but I felt awful and it freaked me out imagining him doing that as an infant.", "Wtf is a burp cloth", "NTA aside from burying the lede.

Putting a trigger warning of \u201cpossible infant death\u201d is ridiculous enough. That told me more than anything else you wrote. \n\nYour request is not crazy. You are right, there is a possibility of suffocation or rolling over,etc. But if this is your reaction to burp towels laid about and leaving the kid on the changing table for a minute, you need to calm down. \n\nIt\u2019s good you want to protect your child, and I support that greatly. But you also sound psycho. \u201cPossible infant death\u201d - are you using your child as clickbait?", "As a parent, having raised our kid, being protective is normal. Being a jerk to your partner can also be normal in situations, especially early on.  As babies don't come with an instruction manual, we all have to learn what works.  But as a couple you have to do the same.  Babies change a lot of dynamics. \n\n2 things I'll offer.  \n\n1) be willing to apologize to your partner.  \n2) be willing to be wrong.\n\n\nKids will get hurt, and sometimes, there is nothing you can do.  You can do everything everyone tells you and run yourself into the ground, and something awful can still happen. Being a parent, you need to come to terms with that.  Doesn't mean you don't try, but you need to focus on meaningful, not everything.  Recognize your partner is doing a risk assessment just like you do but prioritize that differently.  Doesn't mean there isn't love or care.  \n\nNAH", "First thing: as a parent I feel you.

I would be seriously asking them why this particular hill is the one they want to \"die on\" so to speak. What's the root cause of their resistance to this? Is it a passive aggressive stab at you? If so, why put the baby in danger? Just put it out there that they may resent your oversight or that you question their parenting, or whatever the hell it is. Is it a response rooted in ignorance?

And after those things have changed, if he\u2019s still being unsafe then tell him that your confidence and trust in him as a partner is and will be affected by this and that it\u2019s putting a strain on your relationship", "NTA, infants are dumb, but your SO is being dumber. Now, of this level of protectiveness extends into like, the toddler age. I would be concerned, because children do need to learn and grow outside a parents envelope, and you do not want to become a helicopter parent.", "NTA. my partner and I are similar to you two, me being the overthinking more cautious and my partner being frustratingly chill about things. we don't have a kid but have had similar kinds of conversations around safety precautions and it can be very frustrating trying to stress the importance of something in this dynamic without sounding like a nagging AH or eventually losing your temper after one too many \"it'll be fine!\"s. so I can see on a personal level how you might have lost it a bit, especially with something as huge as your child's life being the worry. I don't think your partner is necessarily an AH here either, and probably truly doesn't see it as much of a concern, not out of caring less about your kid but out of a more blas\u00e9 attitude in general, and like you said, genuinely thinking it might be another thing you're worrying too much about", "NTA.

A LOT of people have the belief that if you leave the child alone on the table for a little while, they\u2019ll be fine. This is such a common fallacy that even if you tell someone this isn\u2019t true, they will often have someone else in their lives telling them what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t that bad. I would recommend having your pediatrician lay out what the consequences of what a fall could look like (obviously including death).\n2) The bibs on in the crib. I think it would be incredibly eye opening for your partner if you asked them to imagine how they would feel lying down, unable to move or help themselves, with a piece of cloth around their neck. There\u2019s not a guarantee they\u2019ll be strangled, but there\u2019s a high chance it won\u2019t go well if they start to be. That\u2019s the risk they\u2019re taking with your child.\n\nI know this may not be what you want to hear, but you should document these things while you have a chance.

When my brother was a few months old, my dad was doing something to him (changing clothes or something) and he turned to get something and next thing he knows my brother is on the floor. He fell from an old bed (like the really high ones). They went to the doctor, which sent them to the city's hospital who sent him in a medical ambulance to the main children's hospital in my country. By the time my parents got there, my brother was in surgery fighting for his life. Turns out he had a blood leak in his skull and was taking space off of the brain and basically killing him. The reasons he survived were the fast approach the doctors had and the fact that newborns doing have a completely \"closed\" skull and it resulted on decompression. We were told this was the biggest brain hemorrhage the hospital had ever seen. Again, this is the main and best children's hospital in the whole country. He only made it because his brain wasn't fixed. He got to the hospital dead. Clinically dead, the first thing they had to do was \"bring him back\" and then operate without consent because had they waited for my parents to get there he wouldn't be alive today. Still today people learn about his case in med school.\nAbout 10 years later, a girl fell from a really high place and also had a hemorrhage like my brother's but minor compared to his and no-one was able to help her and she sadly passed away.\nWhat I'm trying to say is your life can change in a matter of seconds. \nPlease sit down your husband and a doctor and have a talk about the small things that can easily turn into something really bad.
