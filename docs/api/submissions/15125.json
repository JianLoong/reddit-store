Can you engineer out some of the major concerns from existence?\n\nWhy is the garbage can in a different room from the changing table?\n\nCan you buy something for the changing table that prevents the baby from being able to easily roll off?  Like a changing table topper with raised edges?\n\nIs there a location you can use a command strip hook in the rooms where the offending burp clothes are left?", "NTA.  My daughter leaves her infant3 and a half months) laying unattended on the couch often.  I always say you know babies have a way of suddenly learning how to roll.

It drives make nuts.", "NTA \n\n\nThat's why changing tables have buckles. \n\n\nAnd where the hell is he going to throw the diaper away for a minute?

But he's not making an effort.", "If the child can roll over in their own, the burp cloths on the crib are not so much a cause for concern. By that time their little airways aren't so tiny and overall they are better at regulating themselves and not in danger of positional asphyxiation every time they move. Best practice is always safest though, and your partner should be more mindful. \n\nThe changing table is another story. There are exactly 0 appropriate times to have baby on the changing table without at least one hand on them, let alone walking away. Literally everything you set a baby on that they arent strapped down in has huge warning labels stating DO NOT LEAVE BABY UNATTENDED because baby will fall off. If baby is rolling over now, soon they will be crawling and can't be left on the changing table for even a second. \n\nHowever, no amount of yelling, nagging, or hand wringing is going to keep baby safer.

Shove the dirty diaper in the corner of the table, or on a shelf, or the floor, or wherever it can go, change the baby, put the baby somewhere safe, and then throw away the stinky diaper.\n\nIf your spouse can't use the changing table safely, then throw the changing table out.\n\nSeriously.

A fall from a changing table can seriously harm an infant, and babies get to moving fast really quickly.  As others have recommended, moving the changing table setup so the baby is not left alone is essential.  Whether that's moving the changing table, buying another trash bin for diapers, or getting your spouse to start changing the baby on the floor/something they can't roll off of, it doesn't matter, but for that piece, you have the right of it.", "NTA.

Are you saying your spouse leaves the baby unattended on the changing table?", "Your partner heard that and is still leaving the cloths? I tend be cautious too and I usually ask my spouse if something is worth the risk. If yes, by all means do you but if not (losing your child is not worth the risk) then it\u2019s an change in behavior that makes sense.

I\u2019ve had two kids and I\u2019ve always been the more relaxed parent but never when it comes to actual danger. Also, he leaves them on the changing table?! That\u2019s really dangerous. I always found it way more comfortable on the floor with them on a changing mat. It\u2019s also way safer.", "NTA\n\nYour spouse CANNOT leave your baby on the changing for even one second. My little boy has been rolling over since he was 4 months old. My baby is now 6 months old and I can't even use a changing table as he moves around far too much when trying to change his diaper. He rolls, he half turns away and does 360s constantly. I think the floor is the best option tbh.\n\nAs for the muslin clothes in the crib, that's a BIG NO NO. God Im actually worried for your baby's safety, I had to stop writing this for a moment to go check I haven't left anything near my baby in his crib (I haven't and I never do but still I had to go check on him). There are so many things that can lead to SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and leave things in the crib being one. \n\nYou are definitely NTA", "NTA about seeing the problems, but keep in mind that accusing someone of endangering a child is a very heavy thing to do, so you could be the A for the way you communicated with your spouse", "Their attitude will change the first time the baby drops off the table. Or if they hear stories of experienced parents who have \"dropped\" their kids (they all do).\n\nTough times for couples when a new baby is in the house, lots of pressure and everyone wants it done right. My suggestion is to talk it out, shouting and lecturing won't work when neither of you is getting sleep nor sex. Keep things collaborative and if you can talk with other new parents it helps a lot to get perspective and hear others stories.\n\nNAH", "NTA.

I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the burp cloth, although your partner should definitely be more careful.", "NTA. Safe sleep practices exist for a reason. Though it seems your infant is almost past the point where you need to worry about the burp cloths, it seems like a very minor ask that your spouse needs to respect. \n\nRegarding the changing table they are absolutely being irresponsible. My toddler is 2.5, has never tried to roll (or jump lol) off the changing table and I left him unattended a week ago and he fell off. He\u2019s totally fine (bc he is a rough and tumble toddler) but I felt awful and it freaked me out imagining him doing that as an infant.", "Wtf is a burp cloth", "NTA aside from burying the lede.

Leaving a child on a changing table and leaving the room is inexcusable.", "[removed]", "As a parent, having raised our kid, being protective is normal. Being a jerk to your partner can also be normal in situations, especially early on.  As babies don't come with an instruction manual, we all have to learn what works.  But as a couple you have to do the same.  Babies change a lot of dynamics. \n\n2 things I'll offer.  \n\n1) be willing to apologize to your partner.  \n2) be willing to be wrong.\n\n\nKids will get hurt, and sometimes, there is nothing you can do.  You can do everything everyone tells you and run yourself into the ground, and something awful can still happen. Being a parent, you need to come to terms with that.

I would be seriously asking them why this particular hill is the one they want to \"die on\" so to speak. What's the root cause of their resistance to this? Is it a passive aggressive stab at you? If so, why put the baby in danger? Just put it out there that they may resent your oversight or that you question their parenting, or whatever the hell it is. Is it a response rooted in ignorance?

He fell from an old bed (like the really high ones). They went to the doctor, which sent them to the city's hospital who sent him in a medical ambulance to the main children's hospital in my country. By the time my parents got there, my brother was in surgery fighting for his life. Turns out he had a blood leak in his skull and was taking space off of the brain and basically killing him. The reasons he survived were the fast approach the doctors had and the fact that newborns doing have a completely \"closed\" skull and it resulted on decompression. We were told this was the biggest brain hemorrhage the hospital had ever seen. Again, this is the main and best children's hospital in the whole country. He only made it because his brain wasn't fixed. He got to the hospital dead. Clinically dead, the first thing they had to do was \"bring him back\" and then operate without consent because had they waited for my parents to get there he wouldn't be alive today. Still today people learn about his case in med school.\nAbout 10 years later, a girl fell from a really high place and also had a hemorrhage like my brother's but minor compared to his and no-one was able to help her and she sadly passed away.\nWhat I'm trying to say is your life can change in a matter of seconds. \nPlease sit down your husband and a doctor and have a talk about the small things that can easily turn into something really bad.

I tried not to make a big deal out of it, because even though it wasn\u2019t technically safe sleep practices, I figured a flimsy burp cloth wasn\u2019t the same thing as like, a fluffy blanket or pillow or stuffed animal.

He probably thinks that the baby suffocating on a burp cloth or falling off the changing table aren\u2019t large risks. (The former, in all reality, probably isn\u2019t. The latter probably is significantly more likely.) But I wonder if he\u2019d be more receptive if you approached him with \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with this,\u201d rather than citing the CDC or whatever. He\u2019s getting defensive because he thinks you\u2019re criticizing him.

Then comes using pillows and blankets. \nWhile it is recommended to leave nothing in cribs until the age of 1, the chances that a small cloth, as long as it isn't near the head of baby causing any trouble is truely minute. They are really not likely to suffocate on it. I didn't find a single case where this was the cause of death. So while it's not best practice, I really would not worry about the burb cloth. \nWith this information, I'd say that for the cloth you are heavily overreacting.
