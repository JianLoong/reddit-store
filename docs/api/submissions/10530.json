She clearly enjoys to be the centre of the world and now she is pushing her kids to be one too. She is rude, manipulative and disrespectful.

This will guide you to set boundaries.

In regards to the babysitting, you don't actually mention her asking you to ever babysit them anyway. If it's a once is a while thing then yeah, it would be nice of you to help her out/spend time with your nieces but she's not entitled to it (especially given the way she's treated your family). If she needs help she should put on her big girl pants and ask for it. She can't just act like an AH and then expect everyone to fall at her feet, respect works both ways.", "NTA-your older sister is extremely self-centered. Do what you can to stay in your nieces\u2019 lives-they need positive influences. Ideas include mailing gifts on their birthdays, seeing them when they visit your mom\u2019s house, etc., but you need to limit all contact with your sister until you see an effort at growing up. Your sister believes that she can control the situation by dangling your nieces like a carrot. I\u2019m actually extremely worried about her as a mother to them.", "NTA. Her kids, her responsibility.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like hell.\n\nI would suggest going LC with her while remaining in your nieces' lives. Idk if that's even possible given your sister's personality/character", "NTA, your sister has to have some screws loose in her head. She expects so much from the world, and yet, here she is just being illogical. You had a fair point too. You got a dog knowing you would have to take care of him and nobody else has to watch over him for you. The same is with kids, you can't expect everyone else to raise your kids when you're the one giving birth to them. You sound like a person who would make for a decent mom since you understand the responsibilities and meaning of what it means to raise and take care of another life.", "NTA. Hate to say this but your sister is toxic, and that is unlikely to change unless she sees that in herself, sounds like some narcissistic tendencies which are just yuck. Sorry you\u2019re going though this OP, but you\u2019re definitely not a bad aunt.", "Of course you are NTA. Your sister sounds like a drama queen. She needs to tone down the entitled behaviour. Taking care of children gets difficult sometimes, but if she's tired and needs help, she can ask nicely, I'm sure you wouldn't say no if you're free.", "NTA.\n\nCan you imagine the arguments that will happen at school for not being on her terms? \n\nShe's 100% entitled.", "NTA So she uses her kids to both punish and reward you? \n\nWhen she feels you\u2019ve done wrong, when you don\u2019t, she doesn\u2019t let you see them. But then she\u2019s mad that you didn\u2019t force your way into their house and babysit them for her? I mean, that\u2019s basically what she\u2019s saying. And then saying had you done that for her then she\u2019ll let you see them more often.\n\nAnd she thinks a 12-year-old who isn\u2019t feeling great should be all up for dealing with a four and two-year-old while in their own parents presence, who should be the ones dealing with them.\n\nYour sister is a complete asshole", "NTA. Your sister sound exhausting", "NTA. I\u2019m glad your other family members have your back. I feel for sorry for the kids.", "I feel so sorry for them as well and I love them to death but my sister always uses her kids against everyone. She literally stopped her kids from seeing any of my family for a year. She won\u2019t even let them see their grandma. I know it\u2019s not their fault and I wish I could help them :(", "She is exhausting. She bullies Hana all the time when I\u2019m not there but when I\u2019m there I don\u2019t allow her to do it and I\u2019ve fell into multiple arguments with her about it", "Thank you and honestly I would babysit for free, it\u2019s the fact that she demands it like it\u2019s her right. She doesn\u2019t ask, she simply says it\u2019s my duty to do it and that really pisses me off", "She is exactly what you said, on a power trip- she has used her kids against us multiple times and to this day she continues to use her kids against us. I told her that her she\u2019s restricting her children from having a real family but she refuses to let them be in our lives. Her husband is even worse, he isolates her and brain washes her. I\u2019ve tried to talk to her and ask if he is abusive but she says she loves him and that I\u2019m an asshole for trying to imply that her husband is not nice. Honestly her entire life is questionable but I just want to be there for my nieces, they deserve bettee", "Thank you, I appreciate these comments as I was starting to feel guilty all over again. This happens all the time, she starts a drama out of thin air, my family ends up being the villains and she becomes the victim and then we feel guilty and try to reach out to her and it starts all over again. It\u2019s an exhausting cycle and I\u2019m done with it", "Yes some people just won\u2019t ever change and it\u2019s saddening when it\u2019s your family member", "Thank you, I agree with this, I hate that she uses her kids to get her way. They don\u2019t deserve to be thrown into all of this, they\u2019re so young and it\u2019s so unfair. I\u2019m done with her. I will attempt to see my nieces and make sure I have a good relationship with them but I will no longer entertain my sisters self centred behaviour!", "Yes it\u2019s difficult and I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve also went through a similar situation, I understand it and it\u2019s hurtful but in the end, there\u2019s only so much we can do. People should not be using their kids as leverage but this is the world we live in and it\u2019s awful. I\u2019m just going to go low contact with my sister and just keep an eye on my nieces", "She definitely has selective memory. She only remembers the fact that we didn\u2019t go to see her kids but she doesn\u2019t remember the fact that she is the one who banned us from seeing her kids", "Honestly it\u2019s because I feel bad for her sometimes. She isolates herself and I end up being the guilty one and so I try to make her a little happy and make her see that she has a family who cares for her but in the end she throws everything back in my face. Actually this time I told my mom that I want nothing to do with my sister anymore and that I\u2019m no longer willing to put my emotions on the line when she doesn\u2019t care about anything but herself", "She constantly asks us to babysit and we actually do but there\u2019s always something wrong, we\u2019ve always been very helpful to her whenever she asked and we\u2019ve never asked for money or anything, I really don\u2019t know what her problem is, she just wants more and more and more", "Thank you so much for the ideas, I will actually do them. I do want to stay in my nieces lives and I\u2019m concerned for them as my sister always isolates them but for now, I just can\u2019t afford to entertain her drama anymore. It\u2019s so exhausting", "Right? Like I\u2019m not crazy for thinking this!", "Thank you for the advice, I have come to the conclusion of doing exactly that, I know she will make it hard for me but I\u2019ll do my best!", "Thank you for your sweet comment. I have spoken to her before about this and as I\u2019ve mentioned on another comment, I\u2019m a very small person and my German shepherd dog is overgrown, he is 50kg and I\u2019m 42kg at 5ft, it\u2019s been very difficult for me to control him and train him but I have never expected anyone else to take on the responsibility for me. I feel that when you decide to bring something into your life, such as kids or pets, you have to rule out leaning on anyone else for support, you have to be ready to take full responsibility and if you can\u2019t do that then you shouldn\u2019t bring any living being into your life. It\u2019s not fair on anyone else to have to put in the effort that you\u2019re not willing to put in. That\u2019s why I have chosen to not have kids unless I\u2019m both financially and emotionally ready to take on the big responsibility. Kids are not toys that you find cute and play with and then hand over to someone else when you get bored or tired. My sister doesn\u2019t seem to grasp the fact that having children was her and her husbands choice\u2014 we, as her family never agreed to looking after her children for her. Of course we give her the help whenever we can but we are not obligated to do anything for her. If I wanted to babysit kids and entertain them all the time, I\u2019d have my own kids!", "Thank you so much, I know that she is toxic to be honest. She is 31, a mother to two girls and a wife and she still cares more about what photo edit to use for her Instagram posts than to actually raise her kids. I feel sorry for her daughters and I wish that I could be in their life more than I am but my sister restricts that. Thank you for reassuring me, I really needed it", "Thank you! I genuinely wouldn\u2019t say no and I have helped her many times, as has my mom- we always reassure her and let her know she has a family who cares for her. Honestly I don\u2019t understand what her problem is, everything goes well and then boom, suddenly she\u2019s blocking everyone and acting like we\u2019re horrible people, using her kids against us. It\u2019s exhausting and I\u2019m over it", "She argues with everyone, at stores, at the hospital, at her kids\u2019 school, she is that one person who always asks for the manager. No one ever can reach her expectations, it embarrasses me when I\u2019m with her", "Oh my god, this is exactly how it is. She uses her kids as leverage and this is not the first time she has forced my little sister to babysit her kids. \n\nMy little sister has adhd and she\u2019s very sensitive\u2014 she\u2019s a people\u2019s pleaser and if Sarah tells her off, Hana starts to become depressed. I\u2019ve had to argue with Sarah multiple times for bullying Hana into babysitting her kids WHILE Sarah is there to look after them. It feels like it\u2019s impossible to get her to see how that is so wrong on so many levels!", "She is:(", "Thank you, I\u2019m glad too and I also for sorry for her kids, she\u2019s constantly taking them away from their family. Her kids love us and always ask her to see us, she just prefers to put unnecessary drama before her kids\u2019 needs", "I am pretty sure they will come to you sometime because with a mom like this, they will need sane relatives around.\n\nNTA.

It's good to know they have someone on their side", "Here\u2019s the thing: it might be harsh but the way you can take that power by not caring about your nieces. She is leveraging her daughters to get what she wants. In the end, they\u2019re her responsibility. She is not entitled to your time, help nor affection. It\u2019s best to go LC as long as your nie are safe then it\u2019s ok.", "I like the balanced approach: value and build a relationship with your nieces and manage her behavior antics. Aunts can have a profound impact on the next generation: Shine On!", "Good, hold your ground and don't go back unless she sincerely apologies and shows signs of real change.\n\nDon't feel bad for people who treat you like shit.\n\nShe deserves to be cut out of your life, she brought this over herself.\n\nAlso she isn't isolated, she still has her husband and kids.", "Welcome! My friend is going through this-so I\u2019ll pass your thanks along to her! She had gotten really creative with seeing her niece and nephew. Her mom lets her know about school performances, piano recitals, etc. My friend goes to all of them! Her SIL (the mother) doesn\u2019t even bother to attend-how crazy is that. The mom is self-centered enough to announce that these events are her \u201cdowntime\u201d. My friend hasn\u2019t seen her SIL in over 3 years I think (intentionally NC). She manages to see her brother at these events and it\u2019s supposedly awkward with him, but as long as her niece and nephew love it, she plans to keep going to things. They are now 7 & 6 I think. I know the youngest is in kindergarten.", "No at all. I have three kids and I would never expect people to just show up and take care of my kids for me. Sticking up for your little sister was the right thing to do.  Someone should have gone off on big sis a while ago.", "I mean, it's okay to lean on others if you truly need help, your sister sounds like she can take care of her kids just fine with her husband. I know that I'm not getting married or having kids until I know I'm financially, emotionally and mentally ready.", "Yes I\u2019m counting on that! One day they won\u2019t need the permission of their mom to speak to me and I will be there for them whole heartedly! Thank you!", "No- but her in laws don\u2019t live here. They\u2019re in another country and she always tells us how her in laws are so nice and that when she goes there, they\u2019re always looking after her kids and how we\u2019re so crap compared to them, but they have only seen her kids like twice?? Her husband is the one who tells her that we are not a nice family for her and she believes him but it\u2019s not all on him as she has always been like this", "I will be, honestly I would never abandon them, I\u2019m just forced to keep a limited contact with them because of my sister", "Thank you for the advice, after seeing all of the comments I will definitely go no/low contact with my sister and just make sure that my nieces are safe and well cared for from the sidelines. I can\u2019t mentally or emotionally afford to be pulled into unnecessary drama anymore", "Thank you! I appreciate the cheering on!", "Thank you for this, I think I needed to hear this from people who have an unbiased point of view. I truly wish for her to be happy in life but I\u2019m no longer willing to hurt myself in order to keep her happy. \n\nYou are absolutely correct that I shouldn\u2019t feel bad for people who treat me like shit, this is something I\u2019m working on. Thank you", "Awww that is so sweet of her and I\u2019m stealing her ideas haha! It\u2019s awful how many people in the world are like this and use their kids to manipulate people. The sister in law sounds like my sister, I can completely relate to her but I\u2019m genuinely as a stranger, proud of her for finding a way to still stay in her nieces/nephews life, thank you again!", "Thank you! I appreciate this. I have a dog who is much larger than me as I\u2019m small and he is big, I have never expected anyone to help me take him to the vet or to train him or to dog-sit him for me, he is my responsibility and I just don\u2019t get her view on things. She definitely bullies my little sister when I\u2019m not around and my little sister told me who it so I\u2019ve had multiple arguments with my older sister about this!", "Yes of course it\u2019s ok to ask for help if you truly need it but you have to be prepared not to get that help. What if me and my mom didn\u2019t exist in her life? This was a responsibility that she took on but now expects everyone else to take care of her kids. \n\nWhen we go out together, the entire time me and Hana are looking after her kids. She says that she can\u2019t shop with them so we have to take them in order for her to shop and I\u2019m completely ok with that but she forgets she has kids- she doesn\u2019t even look to see where they\u2019re going or doing and if they fall as kids do when they\u2019re toddlers, she blames everyone else but herself.

Watch your sick sister at her house to keep both of you out of big sister's path, but don't go get little kids sick.", "Possibly unpopular oponion, but I'm gonna go soft ESH. Your characterization of your sister certainly casts the interaction in a light unfavorable to her, *but* that said, she is right that you should not have come to her house if one of you was sick. She was wrong to demand that your younger sister entertain the kids, but if sis was sick she didn't need to be there. Take her home, for everyone's sake.\n\nEdit: I say this as someone whose 4yo was recently hospitalized with an autoimmune disease related to a virus she caught from a family member. So that's my perspective here.", "NTA. You made some very good points. Not a bad aunty.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBig Sis sounds like an awful lot of work and she isn't interested in you being a good aunt. She's selfish. Stop worrying about it. You're giving her too much of your emotional and mental bandwidth.\n\nThe minute this became an argument, you all should have left. \"You're right. This is a bad time.\" and walked out. Don't give her these moments. She enjoys this.", "NTA!! Being the Aunt doesn't mean free Child care.", "NTA", "NTA. Your younger sister needed someone to stand up and protect her from your older sister, and you did just that. Sis with the kids totally needs therapy. My guess is she is overwhelmed with kids, but you were right, that isn't your problem. Ultimately her kids will suffer, not because of your actions, but due to their parents failures. Just when you see the kids, just let them know you love the kids no matter what and be there for them when they are older.", "It's sounds like she can't even care for her kids that she gave birth too, there's no way I'd let her look after my dog.", "Nta. She has borderline personality disorder.", "NTA.  She's quite the narcissistic piece of work, isn't she?  You owe her nothing.  I'm sorry you are having to deal with that.  Low contact is what I'd do.  And keep letting your nieces know you love them.  Children are smart.  They'll figure it out eventually.", "NTA. Your sister is a difficult person and revels in it. There is nothing you can do to fix her.  \n\n          \nJust go on with your life and share it with people and pets who care about you.", "nta", "NTA\nYour sister reminds me of 2 people I know that are bipolar. She may have undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Her behavior is hard to understand. Hopefully you can be there for your nieces. Good luck.", "NTA. I'd be no contact. Your sister uses the kids as weapons.", "NTA but I think your family is enabling her behavior and her entitlement.", "Nta, my sister is just like this. Everything is everyone else's fault. She literally went to jail for assault but it was my fault for not wanting to hang out with her. You know you're in the right. You're not responsible for her or her children and honestly next time she cuts you out stay out because this cycle likely won't end", "NTA upur sister sounds like she has severe mental health issues.", "Nta, let her ruin her relationship with her kids as well. She sounds horrible", "NTA. My friend\u2019s sister is like this. Picks absolutely insane arguments and goes full-blown no contact over them for years and everyone just tolerates it? My friend is a particular target, but she does it to the whole family. Not sure how anyone tolerates it. I don\u2019t love any kids besides my own enough to deal with that kind of abuse. Cut off contact with her. Take away her power.", "That's what I thought. I was trying to think what it might be. I do know a couple people like this and they are bipolar. Maybe that's what is the situation here. Baffling.", " I was thinking bipolar too.", "NTA, and you're a great aunt and big sister. Your oldest sister, on the other hand, is a manipulative bully--due to her actions because that isn't what a Karen is.", "Definitely NTA, but my heart hurts for her kids. It looks like their (kids') entire family will always be mommy and daddy, since their mom makes it impossible for other family members to build a close, healthy relationship with those children. I really hope your sister is a better mom to those two littles than she is a... well, basically everything else.", "NTA.  She and her husband should have thought about things like childcare and amusing the kids before they had them.", "My moms \u201csister\u201d did this. We cut her off of our family for multiple reasons (very long story) and when I tried to send something to my cousin a few months later, just to my cousins, she had already told them we hate them and that my 14 year old cousin at the time was on S*icide watch because of me. And due to their cognitive delays and autism, (they had some high needs) I don\u2019t know if we will be able to connect again. She already had them trained to respond to anything they thought critical with \u201cIM autistic!\u201d", "Nta but why would you want to be around this awful person. She has always treated you badly and will never change. She even brags about how bad she treats you. Go low contact or better yet no contact.", "Time to go NC with your sister. NTA.", "I get her point about not coming around if someone isn\u2019t feeling well, but that also depends on when it started. \n\nEverything else, screams her entitlement that she doesn\u2019t have a right to. NTA. \n\nHer in laws probably watch the kids because they are spending time with them since they don\u2019t get to see them as often. \n\nSince her husband is telling her this, it\u2019s possible he\u2019s trying to isolate her. Watch out for signs of abuse. Maybe just tell her that you\u2019ll always be there for her and the kids no matter how much time has passed.  Having boundaries with her behavior is ok, just make sure she always knows you\u2019re there in case she needs a safe place to go. Even if you think you\u2019re blocked, just send an I love you/I hope you\u2019re doing ok message once in awhile.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should stop being so stupidly entitled and understand that she will be given what she gives as well\n\nI only feel bad about her kids having to stand such a hypocrite mom", "Oh gosh.. this sounds eerily similar to my sister. We've had a...tumultuous relationship literally since she was born. (She scratched my face so badly she tore a chunk of flesh from my cheek\ud83e\udd74) Anyway, she got pregnant at 15, again at 17, and again at age 21. Each time she'd bring a beautiful baby into this world she'd begin using them as leverage... saying we'd have to do XYZ for her when and how and where she wanted it done or she'd revoke our (our=me(auntie), the grandparents, aunties, uncles, anybody) access to her babies. Now... I absolutely adore those kids.. so I've been frustratingly playing her fucked up game. It didn't feel like I had a choice!  I love those babies with all of my heart as if they're my own kids. With her first two babies, I even helped raise them. The kids are older now (9,7,3).. and I have had talks with the older two to let them know that they could come to me for anything and I'd support them however I could.\n\nAll of this to say.. it makes me really happy to hear that someone in a similar situation dared to stand up for themselves. It gives me hope that I'll have the courage someday to be able to do that too. I truly hope that someday your nieces reach out to you and you can have a close relationship with them\u2665\ufe0e", "NTA\nDo we have the same sister? My nieces and nephews are adults now, but growing up my older sister did the same thing. She was the oldest and I was the youngest.  I took care of them as infants. People thought I was their mother I had them so often. She convinced her daughters that I was jealous of them because they took my place as the baby girl of the family when they became tweens. I didn't have a relationship with the girls until they graduated college. I guess psychology courses taught them that their mother was crazy. They met up with me one day, told me everything she said about to poison them (repeatedly), and ask for forgiveness. I told them that we will have a new relationship, no need for forgiveness. \n\nI hope the same can happen with you, OP!\nI did go NC with my older sister. It was for my sanity. My nephews stayed in contact,  they were older. The girls were lost to me until they made the decision to make contact.", "NTA!! You\u2019re a grown woman who can make her own decisions. Your sister obviously still sees you as her younger sibling who will do anything she asks. Don\u2019t let her boss you around anymore, continue standing up for yourself and take your power back. I feel sorry for her daughters though, they\u2019re being taken on an emotional rollercoaster at such a young age.", "NTA \u2026.not everyone has to have a relationship with family especially if they don\u2019t deserve the realtuonship", "NTA.  \n\nShe seems to operate under the belief that she & her children are the sun & the only reason the rest of the planets & stars exist is to revolve around her & her kids.  You just plainly explained that that wasn\u2019t the case.", "> she starts a drama out of thin air, my family ends up being the villains and she becomes the victim and then we feel guilty and try to reach out to her and it starts all over again\n\nNonsensical.\n\nOnly a mad man repeats the same behavior over and over again while expecting something different.", "> Honestly it\u2019s because I feel bad for her sometimes. She isolates herself and I end up being the guilty one and so I try to make her a little happy and make her see that she has a family who cares for her \n\nI know you're trying to sound reasonable and nice, but your behavior is nonsensical. Time for you to smarten up and stop \"feeling bad\" for your sister (only for your sister to take advantage of it).\n\nOnly a mad man would repeat the same behavior over and over again and expect something different.", "Give her what she wants so much then, tell her that you are not interested in seeing her children and you don't care, so she loses power over you, since she knows perfectly well that you love your nieces very much and she uses that to manipulate you and make herself feel bad, if you take that power away and tell her that you don't care about her or her life then she loses power.", "NTA  Those kids are going to need a good auntie when they're a little older and dealing with their nut of a mother.  Just a single hug, or kind comment or nice birthday card can make them know you're there and feel love and trust for you.  Just keep in touch at family events for now and wait until they need you.", "NTA It doesn\u2019t matter what you did/didn\u2019t do ordo/don\u2019t do because nothing will please your sister.  She needs to be upset about something so she can control others and put them down.  That\u2019s how she feels good about herself.\n\nbtw where was her partner during all this?  Why does he allow her to treat others this way?  And is he doing his share in the things she thinks the women in her family should be doing?", "I don't understand\n\nShe isolates herself, and YOU feel guilty ? To what kind of behavior have you been conditioned. She isolates HERSELF, HERSELF, why would you feel guilty about it ?", "Plus, there is quite an age difference between them. She may feel like she has to give way to an adult.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds like an unhappy person that doesn't know what she wants.", "Some people can't be reasoned with. Unfair to the kids, and grandma.", "Yes I believe she\u2019s capable of that sadly, i will do my best to let them know whatever she says is not true!", "I\u2019m sorry about that:(", "Oh my gosh, that\u2019s awful, I\u2019m so sorry to hear this. So many people here seem to have had this happen to them and it\u2019s just simply saddening:("]}
