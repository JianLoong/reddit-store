My sister has had to stay at hotels before because she felt unsafe and I always worry about her and the babies safety.

Dont know why your mum would think your sister would be upset. Your sister seems to have pretty much cut you out of her life.", "NTA if you can make the ceremony and skip the reception, then do that. If she\u2019s tries to call you on it, just show her this post. Your sister and in-laws are the assholes.", "NAH but I wonder, were you two close before he came into the picture? Not going to the wedding would without a doubt put a rift between you and your sister; she may not talk to you for a while. Based on what you said it seems like she's in a very bad situation, and knowing that she has you, her sister, by her side could very well help her find strength should she decide to make a change. It's hard to support family members in these situations, there's no doubt of that, but it's harder to lose them to a manipulative and potentially abusive relationship. It's definitely a concern considering he's seemingly trying to keep her away from her family. Otherwise, enjoy the concert OP!!", "Your sister is in an abusive relationship,  about to be trapped in a marriage. You're her family. You need to be there for her now more than ever. I'm not talking about the wedding, but you and your family should be letting your sister know that she has a safe way to escape from her husband", "YOLO NTA", "NTA\n\n- Your sister has been blowing you all off for awhile. \n- You made the concert plans first.\n- You even compromised by going to the actual ceremony. \n\nThis is what your sister gets for making your side of the family an afterthought", "It all depends on what\u2019s more important to you, potentially loosing your sister for a while or missing this concert. \n\nYou can rationalize it any way you want but it won\u2019t change the outcomes and reaction of your sister. This also could be used by the abusive husband as a tool to distance her further from you, and as ammunition in the future to discredit your arguments. Something to keep in mind.", "NTA - and at some point people have to be held responsible for their choices.  this guy sounds like a nightmare, as does his family; but it's not like your sister is a slave he bought.  she's chosen to accept this lifestyle, whether it was through manipulation or brain washing, somehow she's convinced herself this is ok.\n\nAll you really can do is be for her when she comes to her senses and escapes this mess.  you don't have to go to the reception, it's just a party, and while most people really only come to weddings for the reception (IMHO) it's the wedding which is the significant/important part", "NTA.  Just RSVP no and apologize that you already had plans for that weekend and send a gift.", "Honestly? For what you described, say nothing to your sister and just quietly bounce. High chance she won't notice.", "NTA. The ceremony is the most important part. Maybe you can make a short appearance at the reception, but many people leave early, so there's no problem if you do, too. If you were really close or a member of the wedding party, you should definitely be there for all or most of the time, but as things are, coming to the ceremony, giving her a nice gift, and wishing her well (she'll need it) is plenty.", "Do you care about your sister? If so go to the reception. If you don\u2019t care go to the concert. Like it or not you will always be remembered for this decision.", "Ywbta - you're so worried about your sister you'd rather alienate and isolate her with him?", "NAH, you\u2019d rather go to a concert than her wedding\u2026\u2026but there will be consequences of some sort. Honestly your a sister and not in the wedding? She can\u2019t be all that heartbroken.", "NTA for all the reasons others have stated. But maybe try to have an intervention with her and other family members before the wedding given the abuse? I mean, if it's so bad she's had to stay at hotels and STILL DOESN'T REALIZE SHE SHOULDN'T MARRY HIM, she needs some help getting out. If you can, try to consult a therapist in how to do this effectively.\n\nETA: Or if not a therapist, at least a book on helping family members get out of abusive relationships.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is her responsibility at the bride. If she didn\u2019t spoke to you for months then she shouldn\u2019t be upset just cause you will not be staying cause you made plans. If I where you I wouldn\u2019t go at all since I wasn\u2019t notified about anything. Also she didn\u2019t even include you in any of the wedding prep things at all.

How much notice did you get for the wedding, and how long before the wedding date did you buy the tickets?\n\nRationale for my questions: Even if you don't approve of your sister's marriage, you should still support her and attend. However, you can't suspend your life for a wedding that may or may not happen. To me, the main factor is the question when the wedding date was confirmed, and when you decided to go to the concert.", "NTA, will she miss you as she will be kissing up to her in-laws?", "NTA, enjoy the Eras tour (I assume)", "NTA you can always go to her next wedding but you might never get a chance to see this band in concert again.", "Agreed. \n\nNTA but if it at all possible let your sister know that you already had plans and you love her and will always be there for her.

If he is really that abusive and controlling of her, he is probably behind why you\u2019re all not being invited/kept in the loop. Definitely sounds like she is being isolated from her family and support system and if shit hits the fan his family will probably side with him, not her", "Something about the tone and rhythm of your story gives me the idea that you\u2019re trying to convince yourself.

Forgive yourself \u2026 no reason for guilt.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you are an ah for preferring to go to the concert, but I think you need to go to the wedding. Her fianc\u00e9 is trying to cut out her family to isolate her and possible abuse her further making it so she feels like she has no where to turn. You and the rest of your family need to show her and let her know she always has all of you."]}
