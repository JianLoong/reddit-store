At 16 if I walked into kids destroying my room I probably would of been beating the shit out of those kids. 9 - 13 is is old enough that those kids knew what they were doing.

Time for that phrase to become extinct.", "I like that even better", "While that's fine, your parents could also help you with *their* friends/guests and tell the guests that their children's behavior was unacceptable and they should help pay for the damages caused. As the parent of two children in the age range of the guests', I would be horrified to hear mine behaved in a similar manner."]}
