I also stick everything I find pretty so there's a bunch of fragile shells, posters, keychains and alot of other stuff on my wall and I have a bookshelf which has my decorative lamps, random mangas I got on discount + other books n comics, anime figurines, skincare and my jewellery box. My bed just has alot of plushies and stuffed animals.   \n\n\nMy parents told me that they were gonna be hosting a lunch party with their friends/mutuals and their kids, I was fine with that since I won't be there for like the first 2 hours of the party because I had tuition and the kids that I thought were coming behaved decently so I wasn't that worried. \n\nI come home and oh my god - my room is a fucking mess. There were shit missing from my walls, most of my trinkets were just gone, some of my anime figurines had their heads missing, my skincare stuff was emptied out, my jewellery was either bent or like one pair of the earrings were missing AND SOME KID WAS ON MY BED AND WAS HUMPING MY BUILD A BEAR WHICH I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY?????? \n\nAfter like 30 minutes, I managed to find most of my missing things but I have to go on a shopping run soon to get my skincare and all my other stuff replaced since the parents aren't paying for all the damage. The culprits were random ass kids who I have never seen before and apparently they were new to the country and like my parents wanted to host a get-together lunch or whatever.   \n\n\nThese kids tried to FUCKING STEAL MY SHIT and I was beyond pissed, I told their parents who dismissed my issues because \"kids will be kids\" and those pieces of shits kept coming in and kept trying to steal my stuff, colour in my mangas or just attempting to wreck something. I had enough of their bullshit and these kids were like from the ages of 9 - 13 like they should be old enough to have some fucking decency but no. So I kicked them out of my room - If they can't respect my space then why should they be there in the first place.   \n\n\nA couple of minutes later, this random ass grandma came and she told me to allow her grandkid to chill in my room and I told her no and gave her the reason for it, to which she responded with how god would reward me for entertaining her grandkid (whos fucking 13 ) and how she's going to die soon and it's her last wish and if I don't do this for her then I'll get sins.   \n\n\nI told her no and guarded my room with my life for the next few hours of the get-together party. I told my friends this and they told me that I should've been less harsh on the kids since they are only a few years younger than me.
