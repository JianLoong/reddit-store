If you want to have a good relationship with your kids you'll need to put in the work. Their adults, it shouldn't really matter to you if they are no contact with each other. But it is your responsibility to develop a good relationship with them separately. You can say your in town that weekend and give each sister a separate time when you are available to meet to have some 1 on 1 time with them.

To be honest we are definitely missing a lot of information on this one. But what do you want the mom to do? They are like full adults, they should be able to handle this themselves.
