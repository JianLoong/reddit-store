If they want to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day, they will reach out to you.

It seems like you want no part of it, but you may be able to help mediate if you\u2019d like.", "NTA Make reservations for you and your husband and have a great time.", "NTA. If they're gonna behave like that whenever they're together then you have the right to enjoy a nice meal without that kind of drama.\n\nUnrelated but I do wonder what happened between them. You mentioned they ask you not to mention the other in conversations and wouldn't attend each other's weddings. That sounds pretty serious......", "NTA- it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, a day to celebrate you. Spend it however you want. If they find out and ask just tell them the truth, you did not want any drama on a special day in a special restaurant.", "NTA.

THAT is where I think YOU screwed up with them.  You could have tried to help mend the rift but apparently you didn't care enough to even try?!  What is up with that?!  I think that's pretty shameful on your part.\n\nYou could invite one daughter to join you the day of this year, and do something with the other daughter the day before or week before or after...and flip it next year.  Idk if just distancing yourself from them is all that wise.  You really ought to rethink how YOU are handling things.   You're a mother so act like it!", "Info: How did you rule out what it couldn\u2019t be if you don\u2019t know what their issue is and you won\u2019t allow them to explain what the issue is?\n\nNTA-You can do whatever you want with your time. I don\u2019t think being a parent ends when kids become adults. The dynamic shifts but if the response to conflict is to ignore it or claim the \u201cnot my circus, not my monkey\u201d you\u2019re not  gonna get positive results that resolve the issue.

HOWEVER, they are  grown enough to put aside all of that for just one day. They are selfish in the fact of not understanding how it affects you. \n\nYou can still celebrate Mother's day even though the girls are not there. I say take your husband and have a good day!", "NTA\n\nHonestly it's a mother's day meal celebrated between wife and husband.

You enjoy the day!!!!", "NTA. It\u2019s your day, do whatever you want.", "YWNBTA Enjoy brunch.  The people who are faulting you for not inserting yourself into their drama would be the same people criticizing you for trying to control your daughters relationship if you did insert yourself.  Your daughters are fully grown women (30 and 29) not 15 year olds.  Your responsibility for their drama ended a decade ago.", "You're 100% allowed to celebrate mothers day with your husband without your kids. And I 100% agree your kids should be the ones arranging something for you on mothers day. \n\nI will say this as I am no contact with one of my parents, it's 100% the parent's responsibility to foster a good relationship with each of their kids independently. If you want to have a good relationship with your kids you'll need to put in the work. Their adults, it shouldn't really matter to you if they are no contact with each other. But it is your responsibility to develop a good relationship with them separately. You can say your in town that weekend and give each sister a separate time when you are available to meet to have some 1 on 1 time with them. I would specify it's 1 on 1 when you contact and ask them to let you know what they would want to do with you for it if they are available. Your husband can busy himself for a couple hours in your old city for that time.", "I\u2019ve tried talking to them, but they just get angry.  They don\u2019t want to sit down and talk it out and try to come to some sort of understanding.  They just both want to complain to me about the other.  If I even try to get them to look at things from the other\u2019s view, I\u2019m playing favorites.  I\u2019ve offered to pay for relationship counseling for them.  Nobody wants to take me up on the offer.  It\u2019s getting to the point where my oldest stepdaughter is going to be the executor of my will when I pass because I can\u2019t trust my two to be civil if I\u2019m not there.", "I agree with this. There might be a very good reason why they don\u2019t get along and by treating both kids as if they\u2019re equally guilty without knowing what caused this doesn\u2019t seem fair. Maybe it is just politics or not getting along, but I can think of 100 reasons why one sibling has a legitimate right to go nc with the other and mom should maybe listen to the reason.", "I mentioned in an earlier comment.  I\u2019ve tried to get them to talk it out with me, no interest.  Offered to pay for relationship counseling, no interest.  The only thing they seem to want to do is complain to me.", "Do most kids think about this at the winter holidays though?", "That's actually a great point. Do the kids even know they would have to book on Jan 1st to get a reservation at the brunch spot or has the mom, OP, always done the reservation? \n\nMy mom plans months in advance for things and I think she's crazy to have her whole life planned out like that but that's because she never shares the why just what her plans are. Communication is key.", "NAH. If you enjoy the restaurant enough to make a trip,  does it have to be on Mother's Day? Go another time and skip the drama.", "NTA. It's your children's job to reach out to you and treat you on Mother's Day.", "YWNBTA \n\nBut how have you not explicitly asked what happened at any point over the last few years? You say you don\u2019t want to listen to them bitch about each other but have you listened at all to what has happened?", "You can\u2019t control their behavior. Enjoy the brunch without them.", "it\u00b4s not responsibility to organize plans for mother\u00b4s day and invite your children to them, it\u00b4ps the other way around.

Tell them you love them very much, you\u2019ve done everything you can to help them resolve their conflicts with each other and you have accepted their decision to be NC. It makes you sad their situation negatively impacts you and while it\u2019s always a shadow on your mind you have decided to spend your special days with people you love and who leave their personal feelings behind long enough to let you enjoy and celebrate your day without negatively impacting it.\n\nAlso tell them their conflict makes it impossible for you to choose either one as executer of your estate especially since they have chosen not to share the conflict source or take you up on professional help to independently mediate it. Reiterate that it\u2019s painful for you to make this decision and you see no other alternative because your highest priority as their mother is to protect their relationship. Given their choices your only option is not to introduce more conflict between them in this life or beyond.\n\nGood luck.", "Second this", "Especially since they got along once upon a time. something happened..", "I asked, if it was something like infidelity, theft, that kind of stuff.

Relationship counseling that I pay for, nope.  I\u2019ve learned from these kinds of posts not to spring them on each other to try and get them to talk (I know that would make me the a-hole.)", "This was kind of an aggressive comment lol", "Eh. I dunno about some of that. If the kids were younger, then sure. But they're 29 and 30 years old.\n\nThat's old enough by far to expect them to be able to sort their own things out without needing Mommy to facilitate the conversation.\n\nAnd if not that then they should at least be able to be mature enough to not make any family activity a nightmare.", "That\u2019s tough. What if you asked each of them to write out their gripes with the other and send it to you? That way they can get through the complaining and you can take a break while reading through and have the complaining end at any time. At least then you\u2019ll know what\u2019s going on\n\nHow have you tried to get them to look at it from the other\u2019s point of view if you don\u2019t know what is the issue?", "Have a one on one talk with each of them and find out what's up.  Tell them how YOU feel about the rift between them and that you want to know what was so bad that they can't even join you and be cordial with each other when you're all together.  Your original post indicates that you have NOT tried, so this comment is at odds with your original post.", "Because you are forcing them together. \n\nOne on one, ask what went wrong. Listen, don\u2019t talk to both of them first and find out what it is.", "Well come on!  OP is so nonchalant about her kids having a rift so bad she can't enjoy mothers day with them both...why are they being so standoffish about it?!", "You might want to edit this into your post. It sounds like you\u2019re not interested in the issue, but you obviously are. If they refuse to tell you the problem, that\u2019s very different from you refusing to listen to the problem.", "It just seems in the comments like she has tried to help them get along, get therapy, etc and it doesn't work. To be honest we are definitely missing a lot of information on this one. But what do you want the mom to do? They are like full adults, they should be able to handle this themselves. OR they should be able to table the fighting to celebrate mothers day. If they are just gonna fight, I would not want to invite them either", "Thanks, I did add that to the post.", "I responded before those comments went up, based on the original post where OP indicates she's stayed out of it except to make sure nobody stole anybody's partner.  But largely has stayed out of it.\n\nThe comments are at odds with the original post.", "Gotcha, I didn't see the original post"]}
