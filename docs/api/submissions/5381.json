If they want to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day, they will reach out to you. If it does come up, you have an easy seque into a conversation about how awkward it was the last time and how you\u2019d love them to talk to you about the rift between them. It seems like you want no part of it, but you may be able to help mediate if you\u2019d like.", "NTA Make reservations for you and your husband and have a great time.", "NTA. If they're gonna behave like that whenever they're together then you have the right to enjoy a nice meal without that kind of drama.\n\nUnrelated but I do wonder what happened between them. You mentioned they ask you not to mention the other in conversations and wouldn't attend each other's weddings. That sounds pretty serious......", "NTA- it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, a day to celebrate you. Spend it however you want. If they find out and ask just tell them the truth, you did not want any drama on a special day in a special restaurant.", "NTA. There's no law that says you have to spend mothers day with your children. Its about you, not them. Spend it with your husband. He made you a mother anyway \ud83d\ude09", "YWNBTA\n\nThere is a lot of drama between them, so you're just trying to avoid having a huge blow-up on your day", "NTA for going to the brunch without them but...\n\nYou ARE TA for being so disinterested in what has caused the turmoil with your kids.  THAT is where I think YOU screwed up with them.  You could have tried to help mend the rift but apparently you didn't care enough to even try?!  What is up with that?!  I think that's pretty shameful on your part.\n\nYou could invite one daughter to join you the day of this year, and do something with the other daughter the day before or week before or after...and flip it next year.  Idk if just distancing yourself from them is all that wise.  You really ought to rethink how YOU are handling things.   You're a mother so act like it!", "Info: How did you rule out what it couldn\u2019t be if you don\u2019t know what their issue is and you won\u2019t allow them to explain what the issue is?\n\nNTA-You can do whatever you want with your time. I don\u2019t think being a parent ends when kids become adults. The dynamic shifts but if the response to conflict is to ignore it or claim the \u201cnot my circus, not my monkey\u201d you\u2019re not  gonna get positive results that resolve the issue.  You\u2019ve screwed up in not realizing they need a mediator since whatever the issue is has seeped beyond them to affect your relationship with each of them together and separately.", "NTA.

You're putting your fingers in your ears and being ignorant and wondering why. How long have you refused to listen them out?  How can you be upset that they aren't communicating when you're not trying to communicate? \n\n\nSomething to think about.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nOne could make the argument that children aren't participating in their own conception so... parents become parents without the kids' input, so to speak.", "You are under no obligation to have a meal with your children at any time, including on Mother's Day.

HOWEVER, they are  grown enough to put aside all of that for just one day. They are selfish in the fact of not understanding how it affects you. \n\nYou can still celebrate Mother's day even though the girls are not there. I say take your husband and have a good day!", "NTA\n\nHonestly it's a mother's day meal celebrated between wife and husband. Celebrating the achievement of successfully raising them all into adulthood and that's that. You don't need children to be there to enjoy the meaning of the day itself.\n\nYou did the work? You enjoy the day!!!!", "NTA. It\u2019s your day, do whatever you want.", "YWNBTA Enjoy brunch.  The people who are faulting you for not inserting yourself into their drama would be the same people criticizing you for trying to control your daughters relationship if you did insert yourself.  Your daughters are fully grown women (30 and 29) not 15 year olds.  Your responsibility for their drama ended a decade ago.", "You're 100% allowed to celebrate mothers day with your husband without your kids. And I 100% agree your kids should be the ones arranging something for you on mothers day. \n\nI will say this as I am no contact with one of my parents, it's 100% the parent's responsibility to foster a good relationship with each of their kids independently. If you want to have a good relationship with your kids you'll need to put in the work. Their adults, it shouldn't really matter to you if they are no contact with each other. But it is your responsibility to develop a good relationship with them separately. You can say your in town that weekend and give each sister a separate time when you are available to meet to have some 1 on 1 time with them. I would specify it's 1 on 1 when you contact and ask them to let you know what they would want to do with you for it if they are available. Your husband can busy himself for a couple hours in your old city for that time.", "I\u2019ve tried talking to them, but they just get angry.  They don\u2019t want to sit down and talk it out and try to come to some sort of understanding.  They just both want to complain to me about the other.  If I even try to get them to look at things from the other\u2019s view, I\u2019m playing favorites.  I\u2019ve offered to pay for relationship counseling for them.  Nobody wants to take me up on the offer.  It\u2019s getting to the point where my oldest stepdaughter is going to be the executor of my will when I pass because I can\u2019t trust my two to be civil if I\u2019m not there.", "I agree with this. There might be a very good reason why they don\u2019t get along and by treating both kids as if they\u2019re equally guilty without knowing what caused this doesn\u2019t seem fair. Maybe it is just politics or not getting along, but I can think of 100 reasons why one sibling has a legitimate right to go nc with the other and mom should maybe listen to the reason.", "I mentioned in an earlier comment.  I\u2019ve tried to get them to talk it out with me, no interest.  Offered to pay for relationship counseling, no interest.  The only thing they seem to want to do is complain to me.", "Do most kids think about this at the winter holidays though?", "That's actually a great point. Do the kids even know they would have to book on Jan 1st to get a reservation at the brunch spot or has the mom, OP, always done the reservation? \n\nMy mom plans months in advance for things and I think she's crazy to have her whole life planned out like that but that's because she never shares the why just what her plans are. Communication is key."]}
