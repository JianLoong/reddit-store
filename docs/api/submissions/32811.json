It seems super misguided to me that your son expected a standard activity to be cancelled due to his spouse's disability. As it is, there are plenty of people who don't participate - either due to ability or desire - and until now it seems no one has felt offended or excluded. It feels pretty friendly as a family tradition to be honest since it is something you can can individually opt into or out of, there are other activities you could do instead, etc.\n\nReally, it feels like a slippery slope like what other things will you be expected to stop doing if Jim cannot also do them?", "NTA - I\u2019m permanently disabled and this seems more than fair. He had options, there was no mandatory attendance required, and there\u2019s no exclusionary element for those who didn\u2019t. \n\nThis screams one of those people who go overboard on behalf of others without being apart of that world. Your son may -think- he\u2019s protecting his spouse, but really he\u2019s the one setting him up for exclusion as being one of those people, because people will stop inviting Jim or trying to get to know him due to your son\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s a different flavor of Savior complex. \n\nI would respond with. \u201cWell, I will be sorry not to see Jim then, I had a great time with him at Thanksgiving, but I will not be apologizing. We did not exclude him, like everyone else you both had options, but I will not be cancelling every possible tradition we have because he may not be able to do it exactly as you did. If YOU want to exclude your husband from our family, that is your choice as we greatly enjoyed seeing him, but I am not going to make everyone resentful of him by cancelling everything to suit you.\u201d", "NTA.  I am newly disabled and would not ask family to change their traditions.  I try to adapt as much as possible.  I have had to ask for some accommodations (picking host sites based on availability of ramps) but will just make other arrangements if my needs can't be let.  I don't feel the need to stop others from enjoying activities I can no longer do.", "NTA my dad is blind but he doesn\u2019t expect me to stop looking at things when he is around.", "NTA\n\nYou have done nothing wrong. Your traditions don\u2019t have to change because a single person is unable to participate. \n\nThere is nothing to apologize for. Your son wants to take a stand on this, maybe being away from family this year will give him pause and let him think how ridiculous he is being.", "NTA. It has always been a tradition for anyone who wants to participate. Super unfair of your son to insist you stop being active because someone else can't be. Grandma can't go either, but you don't see her demanding you cancel and apologize.", "NTA. You have nothing to apologize. Just because someone is disabled doesn't mean other people can't do sports or games. Does your son really expect people to change their lives and give up things because of who he married? What does Jim have to say about it?", "NTA, and here\u2019s the important question here: Who is upset? Is it Jim, and he feels discriminated against because of his disability? Or is it your son, who is perhaps speaking *for* Jim about an issue that perhaps Jim is not upset about?", "no, of course NTA. members of my family have been doing hikes and turkey trots my whole life. people who can't or don't want to don't get stop others. what a goofy thing to be mad about.", "NTA  \n\n\nUsually Turkey Trot events are held to benefit programs for those living with disabilities.  If yours is, you should point that out.   Cancelling the event because someone is feeling left out is inappropriate.   Making an effort to help Jim feel included might help, or might not.", "NTA \nYour son is ridiculous! It\u2019s ok that his husband can\u2019t do it. That doesn\u2019t mean the whole family cancel it. Let them not come to Christmas they are the ones missing out.", "NTA.  Your tradition includes an activity (chilling with Grandma or arriving later) for people who don't want to do the turkey trot, and it appears that no one gets ridiculed for slipping it.  Not to mention that because family members each make a choice, it is not like the new guy would be stuck alone while every one else turkey trots. \n\nI don't think you need to apologize.  However, I think it might be worth asking if the gentleman felt excluded, and whether there are things you could do (short of canceling the trot) to help him feel included.", "Nope. NTA. Making a disabled person welcome does not mean that everyone abstains from all activities in which they cannot participate.\n1. the trot occupied a small portion of the day\n2. It happened in the morning before other activities \n3. There were other people not participating; he wouldn\u2019t have been singled out\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Jim was fine with things and your son was creating this issue out of a misguided sense of protecting Jim.\n\n[edited for language]", "NTA - those of us who can participate shouldn't refrain from participating in the presence of those who can't.", "You need to sit down with your son and Jim and discuss.  It sounds like your son is being over sensitive, and protective of Jim.\n\nYou are NTA, but you need to find out what the issue is before Christmas.

Short story? Where society devolves into everyone has to wear crippling shoes because someone has a limp and glasses that reduce their eyesight so they\u2019re the same as others with bad eyesight\u2026 I\u2019ve heard this story somewhere before and it was used as a ridiculous example to illustrate the fears of communism or some old crap. I\u2019ll find it.\nI can\u2019t run so none of you can anymore - what a shit thing to do! Who would inflict their disability on everyone around them? What an awful person. \n\n \nIt\u2019s [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron).", "If I was Jim I would be horrified to learn that a tradition has been cancel because of me. You did the right thing and your son is in the wrong for treating his spouse as if he is that fragile.", "NTA if your son was expecting you to cancel the Turkey Trot, he should have spoken to you beforehand. Refusing to come to Christmas unless you apologise for being a mind reader seems a touch excessive to me", "A disability stops one person. It doesn't stop everyone. \n\nDude can walk slowly or with assistance, maybe even get pushed\n He could volunteer to help at a water/drink station or at an intersection to guide runners. *He 100% can still participate, he's choosing not to.*\n\nProblem is, he/they believe that a \"reasonable accommodation\" for his disability is that everyone else acts disabled. Instead of having a ramp/elevator, why not agree not to use all structures that aren't only on flat ground? That's pretty much the logic. Would you agree to never go above ground floor *because it's not as easy for him*? So they're gonna believe they're the victim pretty much no matter what. \n\nInstead of apologizing maybe start from scratch. What accommodations do they feel are appropriate? What traditions could you start? Etc.\n\nNTA", "NTA But is this coming from Jim himself or just your son? I'm going to guess it's probably just your son being hypersensitive to a new partner\u2019s disability. And if Jim can't run in the trot, there are still tons of ways to participate like the registration booth and timekeepers.", "NTA, I have mobility issues and my sister and her partner are very active and go running together, I don\u2019t expect them to stop doing that when I visit, but I\u2019m 1000% not going.

That being said, maybe see if next time there\u2019s something you can do to include your son in law. Maybe he could sit on a skateboard while your son pulls him and they see if they can win? Just spitballing ideas here. Either way, NTA. If you want to extend an olive branch, you can say something to the effect of \u201cI\u2019m sorry we made you feel excluded. How can we organize it in the future to make you feel included?\u201d", "NTA\nI developed fibromyalgia around the time I competed in a mud run. Sometimes in a flair I can\u2019t do things I love.

Next year maybe you can rig something up to help him participate. Redneck contraption like a wheel barrow. I don\u2019t know. I like fun. Was your son actually advocating for what he wanted or was he advocating on behalf of Jim?", "NTA\u2014the only one excluding your SIL is your son\u2026I am sure that if they both wanted to participate they could have found a way; if his spouse really couldn\u2019t participate at all there were alternatives to the activity. No one was intentionally singled out.", "NTA  can Jim not use a wheelchair to participate?", "NTA in the least.  Its pretty selfish to expect an entire family to abandon a tradition for one person.  Its not like every single person is walking except Jim.  And Jim had more than one option to participate.  If I were Jim, I would feel horrible if my disability forced everyone else to stop doing something they enjoy.", "NTA. the Turkey Trot is your tradition, and you should continue to do it. No way should you apologize. It's not mandatory, not everyone does it, Grandma is home if they want to visit. Lots of people just stay in jammies and watch the parade and don't get out and about until the afternoon. In our area, I've seen plenty of people in wheelchairs, with amputations, participate in a similar run. One local dad runs and pushes his disabled adult son in his wheelchair along the route. Some events have shorter routes for families whose young children want to participate.", "NTA. My husband is disabled, and if my family did a turkey trot, he wouldn\u2019t care because he wouldn\u2019t participate even if he wasn\u2019t disabled. He would tell us to have fun he\u2019ll still be sleeping and he will join us when we\u2019re done. To assume and expect you guys to cancel what is a family tradition long before your son met and married his husband is absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. He needs to get used to not being able to do a lot of things because of his disability. Life isn't fair. Something you must accept.", "NTA I'm disabled and sometimes can't participate, you'll find me at the finish line holding the drinks (wine \ud83d\ude01) ready for the winner. They can't expect you to cancel everything.", "NTA.  That's ridiculous.  So they're that self centered that they expect everyone else to change a tradition because of one person?  He could go and cheer on the participants.  He could go the house as suggested.  Sheesh.  I've developed arthritis in my feet over the past couple of years, so I know I couldn't participate.  I'd NEVER expect others to stop doing something they enjoy because I can't do it.", "NTA To me it's your son's job to sit things out that Jim can't do, not yours. \n\nI kind of wonder if your son is feeling alone and having FOMO himself after committing to someone with limitations on their mobility, and if *he* is actually the one feeling excluded. \n\nMy parther has a disability (one leg was amputated). There are some things I enjoy like skating and hiking that he just can't comfortably do with me (YET--we've been talking about if there's a safe way for him to skate). It has taken some getting used to and some creativity on our parts. I do feel a bit sad sometimes that I can't experience certain things with him or have to do some things on my own. It's not a huge deal, but it does come up here and there. \n\nI'm also curious if it's Jim's choice to skip things like the Turkey Trot. For example, my boyfriend can wear his prosthetic if he really wants to do certain things, but sometimes he just doesn't want to do it that bad to be uncomfortable/inconvenienced with the prosthetic. So he skips it. Other things he wants to do he will use an adaptation. We did a Turkey Trot too and he brought his wheelchair. Had a great time. I'm surprised a wheelchair isn't an option for Jim if he *wanted* to do a Turkey Trot that bad. Something tells me he doesn't want to that badly but your son does but feels guilty leaving Jim to do it. So he's trying to make you cancel. \n\nI don't think you're the asshole at all, and I wonder if as a mother, you want to check on your kid. \"Son, what is this really about? Are you okay?\" I wonder if your son is actually feeling a little isolated and needs to be able to talk about that--to someone who is not Jim.", "NTA. Either your son or Jim or both need to come to terms with the fact that Jim can't participate in everything. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't ever run a race again.

Just because Jim can't participate doesn't mean that everyone else shouldn't.", "Tell him enjoy cooking his own Christmas dinner. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. As a disability advocate, I think you did the right thing-you included him. It would be insulting to assume he was incapable of attending or even participating. \n\nI don\u2019t know of any race that wouldn\u2019t want someone there and there are millions of folks with mobility issues that love to race. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that people think of others with different abilities are incapable of living a fun and active life or having an opinion. \n\nYou asked if he wanted to go. You\u2019d ask the same of anyone. Jim is no different. Most folks dont want pity, they want equality.", "NTA. This is a tradition that already has established 'rules' for those who can't or don't want to take part. your son was aware of all aspects of the tradition.\n\nIt is not being inclusive to cancel a tradition just because one person can't take part.

It also infantalises the disabled person, assuming they can't handle this kind of thing. \n\nAfter that Christmas ultimatum for your son, I'd be saying I won't invite him to family events until *he* apologises for his behaviour, to be honest.

Disabled people understand that things they can\u2019t participate in still occur and it\u2019s not usually a problem.

That way you can be more inclusive for those already sitting out and for Jim. If you do, you should find something that everyone who cannot do the run can take part in.\n\nUltimately, Jim felt left out and he was. It was not by design, but by neglect. You can fix it by swallowing your pride, making the apology, and inviting Jim to help plan the new activity.", "Info: what kind of disability- like are his arms also effected or just his legs? What was the terrain of the race? Asking because on flat ground, wheelchairs can race if you can use your arms to propel the wheelchair.\n\nAlso info: do you ever not do the turkey trot for some reason (eg weather) and if so, what would you do on thanksgiving morning instead- would it involve your son in law or would it be something like having a lie in? Because if your son knows that if the turkey trot is cancelled, you do x fun thing instead that his husband could join in on, then it could seem exclusionary when there is another option. \n\nAlso info: how did the argument go? What was said? What was the conclusion? The problem might not be what happened but how it happened.\n\nI\u2019m generally thinking not the asshole. I have multiple chronic illnesses and can\u2019t walk well. I use a wheelchair but can\u2019t self propel due to arm muscle problems. I\u2019m perfectly happy to cheer on my friends and family at their events though, or stay inside in the warmth with the tv. Sometimes it sucks to not join in but it is what it is. \n\nDisabled people can be excluded a lot because of ableism. Which sometimes builds up to being upset about everything I can\u2019t join in with, even if it\u2019s completely reasonable for that thing to go ahead anyway. So I have to try and be objective- am I actually being excluded this time or am I just fed up with exclusion to the point of frustration with something small? So I would also look at what else is going on here- is your son in law feeling excluded from the family more generally? Are you including your new son in law in other holiday traditions?", "YTA You could have modified the race to include everyone. It's not that hard to do.

I'm chiming in as a disabled spouse that has had some friction with my in-laws about it in the past. Let me share some feedback from experience:\n\n\\- Don't invite them to activities that Jim can't participate in and then get upset that Jim and your son aren't participating (i.e. my in-laws got upset that we didn't accept their invitation to an amusement park when I wouldn't be able to go on any rides and my wife didn't want to strand me on a bench holding everyone's bags or pay admission just for us both to sit there doing nothing).\n\n\\- Don't trip-plan family events that have something Jim would be excluded from in the middle of without the possibility of alternatives (i.e. my on a family vacation my in-laws planned a whole day of activities with zip-lining in the middle. My options were either to stay at the hotel alone all day and miss all of the activities, or sit alone for two hours on the porch of the zip-line place while they had fun so that I didn't miss out on the other activities of the day). ... For the Christmas tree in the city, that means that you can present alternatives: Some of us are going ice skating, some of us are going to sip hot chocolate and listen to the carolers (and if only your son and Jim opt for hot chocolate, bite the bullet and join them so that they don't feel excluded). \n\n\\- If Jim does something outside of his normal physical activities to participate in the family activity, give him space to recover afterwards (i.e. if the whole family goes on a walk and he says he needs to go lie down for a bit afterwards because he's tired/sore then offer him a quiet place to rest because light exercise to most people can be a lot of effort to others). \n\n Now, from the other side: I know that I can't expect my in-laws to cancel all family plans that I can't do and your son and Jim can't expect that either. As long as you are respectful of his boundaries and make sure to have family activities that \\*are\\* accessible to him that should be sufficient. \n\nI think that you are NTA for still doing the turkey trot the morning of Thanksgiving considering that you still had an accessible family thanksgiving that evening but you should have a conversation with them about reasonable expectations, accommodations, and boundaries on both sides.", "Yeah. Will weddings be called off because Jim can't walk down the aisle? Extreme example but this is so entitled", "Some places have disabled skating so worth calling them up.", "NTA!!!

If the race is Thanksgiving morning, and there is still a family dinner, then I don't see the problem.  There is a race and dinner. Jim doesn't run so Jim goes to dinner.  NOt a big deal. \n\nI do think though that there IS a responsibility on your part, as the mom of your son, to consider his partner when choosing family activities.  I DO think you should create events where everyone can participate.  As a show of inclusion, and wanting to share family moments with the entire family.  How about you ask your son for some ideas because you do want to show Jim he is included, and no, you dont' have to change everything about your family traditions.

But it could also be that your son is white-knighting for his husband and is doing it behind his back, and if that's the case, letting him be the intermediary might make having a relationship with Jim impossible for you", "You might want to speak directly to him, though. \n\nI know all about the \"not rock the boat\" \nYou can easily form it as a more innocent question tbh. \nThen, a direct question. \n\nMaybe he didn't even know your son was trying to ban you from doing the troth, and if he didn't. Imagine how he might end up feeling if this keeps up because people don't want to put up with it. And dislikes him, and he doesn't even know why? \nI would personally be mortified if my partner tried changing family events for my sake. If I was perfectly fine with not participating.", "ask him directly, as a disabled person i can guarantee you this wont be the first time he's had this conversation.", "You probably do want to speak to him directly - maybe frame it as \u201cwe\u2019re planning a bunch of activities for Xmas - are there any you\u2019d like us to add, or tweaks we could make?\u201d Because you will need to make tweaks to make sure he\u2019s not excluded, and that sounds like it\u2019s been a problem before, if this is your son\u2019s reaction. He sounds bruised at his partner being treated like a burden who can just be parked in a corner and doesn\u2019t deserve consideration.If you\u2018re going into the city to see the tree and to skate, will you be eating there? Is the restaurant accessible to him - or is there another restaurant he\u2019d reccomend? Are the crowds around the tree a worry for him? What could be done about that so he can be included - or at least asked if he wants to be? He\u2019s the expert on his life, so people need to treat him like it.\n\nI deeply dislike my disability being treated as a dirty secret that has to be whispered about over my head. It\u2019s not disrespectful to ask, to think about him and what you can do to make sure he is there. It is disrespectful to assume and exclude without consideration. It\u2019s not always possible to adapt activities to make them accessible - right now I\u2019m on my way to a business meeting where I won\u2019t be able to participate in the attached tour because the required safety equipment is not compatible with me - but it\u2019s worth putting in the effort to try and find out, because maybe he\u2019s not the only one who\u2019d prefer a less crowded and active activity, and he and your son can lead on that one. Maybe in the future he\u2019ll want to get a cross-country wheelchair and will outrace everyone at that year\u2019s turkey trot. Got to keep your options open", "I don't think asking Jim would help any, and he'll probably feel like it's an issue for you, while it's just your son making drama. \n\nDon't stop with your traditions. If grandmother is staying behind anyway,  it's not like he'd be sitting alone. I would keep inviting them. If your son keeps making drama, have a conversation about him sheltering his husband like he's completely helpless. Having trouble, walking should not mean you feel bad when other ppl are enjoying something you physically can't. It's not the walking, it's the coming together and making memories. \n\nYou could ask how you could all make these events nicer for Jim, or you could just add a kind or 'home base', for 'everyone that's not up for x activity',  with treats and festive drinks. \n\nNTA \nAnd don't let yourself be bullied to apologize for something that is not a problem", "Ask him directly. Perhaps he has a tradition that can become part of yours.\nSeems he has less trouble than his partner about his disability.", "Has your son said you should apologize *to Jim*, or just that you need to apologize?", "You are not overstepping by speaking directly to Jim.  You are being respectful of the person with the disability.  There is a saying in the disability community \u201cNothing about us without us.\u201d  Honestly it sounds like your son is being overprotective of his husband.  It is entirely possible that Jim had no clue this was going on and may not he aware of the threat to boycott Christmas.", "I'm disabled and have trouble walking. I have also experienced the well-meaning but misguided attempts of loved ones to go to battle on my behalf over things I don't actually care about or need anyone to fight for for me. \n\nIt might be worth it to take Jim aside separately and ask him to tell you what accomodations he needs in his own words himself and let him know you want to find ways to include him in all of your traditions in whatever ways he'd like to participate. Even if I couldn't run myself, I'd still have a blast hanging out on the sidelines eating snacks, cheering, and bonding with family members before and after they finish.\n\nNobody likes to be the one disrupting an established routine or tradition. I'd be willing to bet quite a lot that what he wants more than anything is to find a way to quietly integrate himself into whatever you're doing with the least amount of fuss.", "You should definitely ask the spouse. While it can be very frustrating not being able to do everything or participate all the time due to a disability, it's a reality of SO's life. For me, as long as there are other things I can do and join in on, it really doesn't matter. I expect there to be things that I won't be able to participate in\n But your son didn't grow up with the disability and is probably just being defensive and wanting to make sure his SO doesn't feel left out. He'll need to learn that there are some things they just won't be able to do and that's okay. As long as you do not pick every single thing that you know he can't do during a family event. Of course there will be times where your son and his SO just might not be able to come. It'll all depend on how the SO deals with it. Like for ice skating. No, he won't be able to do that but would he be okay drinking hot chocolate and watching? Or walking around town a little and meeting up for dinner later?", "it's not overstepping when you've been directly placed in the center of this situation.", "Ask him directly. He has a mobility issue I\u2019m sure he would appreciate the consideration. I would be surprised if he said he wanted you to stop.  It starts to become an issue if every family gathering involves something he can\u2019t do however as that shows a lack of consideration.", "I think u should ask him directly", "I don't think you were the asshole. But I am curious: Have their been other family events Jim hasn't been able to participate in because of his disability. And does your family make a very solid effort to include Jim and make sure your homes amd the places you go to are generally accessible? Maybe your son's anger isn't only at Jim not being able to participate in the race, but possibly a culmination of unintentional microagressions or exclusion of Jim due to his disability. \n\nI do think it would be good for the three of you sit down and have an open conversation about how included Jim feels in this family, and honestly ask of there are things you can do maoe Jim feel more included. He's an outsider to your family and also having a disability can cause people to not be included, so the gracious thing for you to do would be to see how you can be a more inclusive and accepting MIL (and I'm sure you are a good MIL, but sometimes we've all done careless things that unintentionally hurt our loved ones.\n\nFinally, while I'm not sure the level of Jim's disability, but if he is interested in being a part of a race in the future,  check out My Team Triumph, which pairs able-bodied athletes with athletes with disabilities who partner together in races. It's a really cool organization. https://www.myteamtriumph.org/", "Also please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but usually these things are pretty open to participation. I just googled my local one on a whim. It\u2019s billed as a Walk/run and there are MANY categories. \n\n\u201cWheelchair users can register in any categoroty, even elite if they qualify by time\u201d\n\nIn other words Jim probably COULD participate if that\u2019s what he wanted to do.", "To be fair, the zip-lining example happened within the first year of my becoming disabled and I was still very much coming to terms with my situation and they all came out gushing about what a 'once-in-a-lifetime' experience it was and, 'I can't believe you missed it,' and 'I can't even describe it, you have to experience it yourself'. I think people's reactions to that situation could vary quite a lot depending on the situation. \n\nBut more importantly, I think you might be onto something that Jim might not know. I'm wondering if OP's son is throwing a fit because \\*he\\* feels like he's missing out on a family tradition (because he feels like he can't participate if Jim can't) and therefore if he can't participate that the rest of the family shouldn't either. An open, honest conversation between OP, the son, and Jim about the situation seems in order.", "Yeah there are, admittedly, a lot of things that you might not think about as exclusionary if you don't live with the disabilities all the time (i.e. this restaurant has a single step to get in the door and an electric wheelchair user won't be able to get in even though all of the other activities planned within the building would be within their physical abilities) but other things (like the person with physical disabilities can't go zip-lining/on roller coasters/skiing/hiking up a mountain/etc) seem glaringly obvious.", "OP doesn't HAVE to, but isn't it nice if we all make our loved ones feel a little less isolated or excluded sometimes?", "Because they have empathy and don't want to isolate a disabled person from family gatherings? Because they want to build a relationship with their son in law? Because they don't want their son to go no-contact?\n\nI'm not saying that OP should miss out on fun every time, I'm saying that there should be compromise, and that they should have open dialogue about needs and accommodations (and recall, I did say that OP was NTA). Ideally, there would be equally fun alternatives and people could just choose which one suits them so it's not 'missing out' so much as choosing an activity (I didn't like research activities in depth for the comment I made on reddit, I just pulled an alternative off the top of my head). Not everyone likes ice skating whether they are disabled or able bodied.\n\nEdited because I changed it to gender neutral but didn't change all of the grammar properly", "This is an excellent perspective. As a disabled person, it really frustrates me when people decide what I can/can\u2019t do and how I feel! Jim should definitely be included in the conversation.", "This is a great way to address the issue. Approach with a desire to be inclusive and show care that Jim is important. If Jim has no problem with it, then your son has some genuinely misplaced anger, and perhaps Jim can help sort out the root cause. OP, you are not the root cause and are NTA.", "This is really good advice", "Perfect response.", "and, u/SafetyTraditional721, as another disabled person - unlikely to be an issue. Most disabled folks recognize that there are differences, and being included doesn't mean I have to race (cheering and trash talking are usually parts of the tradition, right?).  Also... depending on how the trot works and where it's staged, it's still entirely possible for Jim to participate if he wants.", "NO. I\u2019m disabled. I would want the OP to directly address ME about this\nPerceived slight. Because if he doesn\u2019t feel slighted he should have no problem telling you. And go about it as \u201csome felt it was wrong for us to do the Turkey trot as you can\u2019t participate and I wanted your opinion.", "yeah, that's what i was thinking about. even if Jim doesn't own a racing wheelchair- and there isn't an organization locally that could lend him one- he could still do the walk part of the turkey trot, if he was interested.\n\nI wonder if OP's son is so worried about Jim feeling excluded that he's not looking at the events and thinking about how Jim could be included. He's jumping immediately to exclusion.", "Lol, now I'm imagining my husband's electric wheelchair doing 6mph during the entire race. \n\nToo bad he only has  about a 10 mile range, it would be funny to participate, but it would ruin the rest of his day since he'd have to limit where he goes and he usually uses +75% of his range each day.", "I hear you. It took awhile for me to adjust, too, and it sounds like your family was absolutely tone-deaf regarding your grief at the loss of your abilities. \n\nAnd your second paragraph definitely reflects my suspicions. I think the son might have strong thoughts and feelings about what needs to happen to ensure Jim feels welcome, but he probably hasn\u2019t even asked Jim what he thinks or wants. I suspect the son is trying to be a good partner but is focusing on the wrong things.", "We realized this several years ago when my MIL was in a wheelchair. It would make me so angry when able people would just park in front of curb cuts.", "I said the same in my comment, I think she needs to speak with Jim because I\u2019ll be very surprised if this was his idea.

It honestly sounds like her son has decided to be upset on his husband behalf, would you be upset at your spouse for that?", "Exactly and I hope OP understands that. If this is all on the son and Jim is politely oblivious to all of this, he shouldn't be made to feel unwelcome.", "\"You see, dad. Oops, my bad.\"\n\n\"Now look here, you little shit! Ah!

I don't know that that's what happened here, but it kind of seems like it.", "...And likely Jim doesn't care. Your son sounds like a toxic ally. He *thinks* he is advocating for his disabled husband, but in reality, he is being disrespectful to Jim by being mad \"on his behalf\" of something Jim probably isn't mad about at all. I think you need to talk to Jim, privately, about what your son is saying. Have you talked to him at all since Thanksgiving, or only your son? I wonder if Jim even knows why they aren't joining you for Christmas.", "Sounds to me, your son is the one who has more problems with his spouse's disability than his spouse does. I can appreciate wanting to find a way to include him in everything with family as much as possible, but this sounds a little more like insecurity on his end.", "Definitely ask Jim directly how he feels.", "I recently discovered that there is a kindle app for my phone.  pro: easy to carry a book, con: my phone battery seems to be more drained now.", "If it's the post I am thinking of, the real issue there was the family demanding they still send the children, one of whom wasn't even a year old.", "I've done turkey trots where people in wheelchairs whizzed by me while I basically took a walk.

Inclusion is about recognizing that we do live in an ableist society and ensuring that those who are able bodied also think about how that ease of access provides privilege. Also keep in mind your son is probably the most vocal because he loves and is being an advocate for his partner that allows his partner to be recognized in a safe way for him.", "A person can have empathy and still not want to miss out on things they enjoy because of who their child chooses to be in a relationship with. \n\nIn an ideal world there would be equally fun alternatives, but in reality most people enjoy specific things.

My sister is in a wheelchair and my first thought was jogging while pushing her chair. She would have a blast with that.", "I would love it if Jim were like, \"Oh my gosh-- I can't go on a run?! I've never thought of that before!\" \n\nIn my experience, disabled folks have a strong sense of what works and what doesn't for them, and having the option to participate or not goes a long way.

And no apologies!!", "I think you and the boys need a sit-down, perhaps with your SO, if any. This may be your boy being extra sensitive on Jim's behalf, or it may be a Jim issue.

While y'all should look for ways to include him in any activities, but there are some he just cannot do, and that is ok too.\n\nThe Turkey Trot, for example, could likely be done in a wheelchair. Your boy needs to dial it back a bit.", "NTA. My grandfather was the victim of a particularly bad case of Polio, and was confined to a wheelchair with very limited mobility. He would have watched the Turkey Trot from the sidelines and cheered. He wanted us to participate in life, and he participated to the best of his ability with the unwavering help and devotion of my grandmother. My grandmother would have started a Turkey Trot for the disabled. Grandpa never felt sorry for himself or complained. My grandparents overcame illness, poverty, tragedy, and disability. They built a successful multigenerational business, traveled the world, and helped other people. Being disabled doesn\u2019t mean life is over. \n\nPerhaps your family can start a new tradition with a different holiday activity that your son-in-law can participate in so he feels included, but keep doing your Turkey Trot every year.", "I recently saw a video of a woman who had all four limbs amputaded in a race. A person was pushing her in her wheelchair and the girl was hyped. \n\nAnother was of lady who goes mountain climbing in modified wheelchairs with her family's assistance. \n\nGranted, it demands disposition and quite often monetary resources. But if there is a will (and no financial impeditives in the way), there is a way. \n\nMaybe your son is being too protective of your SIL, who might not even mind it. Or maybe SIL's disability is recent so he is still rather sensitive about it, losing a limb or ability is very traumatic. \n\nIdk what the situation is. But you should talk more about it to your son, find out if it is something Jim requested or if it is an idea that came from him because he thought it would hurt Jim's feelings. \n\nI understand wanting to not participate in this activities if Jim's disability is recent and he is still dealing with trauma, but canceling the whole event seems off. \nBest case scenario your son is being overprotective and Jim wouldn't mind or even would have fun watching. Worst case scenario is either Jim is still recovering, either your son knows Jim would want to participate and doesn't want to run pushing his chair or something.

I find it hard to believe they couldn\u2019t either participate or hold signs at the finish line. \n\nThere will be times where accommodation or change of plans  will be necessary, and there will be times you may separate for activities. \n\nMaybe your son is feeling especially defensive of his spouse since they are newly married. So I\u2019d give him some rope until emotions cool down. But I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here.", "I wonder where Jim stands on all of this. Most disabled people I know, myself included, are pretty used to our limitations and don't expect other people to adopt them too. \n\nIt would be very odd if Jim wanted everyone else to feel disabled too.", "I also like it\u2019s worded as if everyone will miss Jim and no mention of OPs son.
