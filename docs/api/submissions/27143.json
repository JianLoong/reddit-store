He yelled \u201ccan I get out here\u201d at me (because he isn\u2019t able to just come up to me and talk to me like a human). I told him \u201cno, I am not going to stop to let you off the bus here, you can wait for the next stop across the street\u201d.

I stopped the bus at the bus stop to let people out and he speed walked off of the bus and across the street before I could get cops involved. Luckily a woman I always see him ride with knows his first and last name which I will be providing my supervisor with and the police with.

Maybe give him a warning first.", "What does your supervisor or other coworkers say?", "Have you talked to your supervisor? This guy could damage the bus and then try and sue.", "What about \"Right of admission reserved\"?  If you don't let him on the bus in the first place, then the problem is entirely resolved.", "Wait...wait...we're flying right over Wichita! Let me off here!!!", "Discrimination against the poor is what this whole situation is. Make them walk a ridiculous amount to get to a bus stop and don't put enough bus stops up and then be like \"lol call a cab\" like yeah that might work once in a while but not every day to work. That shit gets mega expensive.", "Where I live a driver would risk sanction if they repeatedly let someone off between stops.\n\nNTA", "Not opening the doors unless you're at a stop isn't false imprisonment, otherwise literally every bus driver in the world is guilty of it already", "I mean is it the bus companies fault he\u2019s uncomfortable using crosswalks?", "I dunno, if there's an increase in stops at a certain route you might end up losing passengers who can afford alternative means of transportation if they think that it takes too much time to move from A to B which in turn can lead to the route being shut down because not enough people use the route anymore.", "Sure, makes sense. Thanks", "> Has he succeeded in jumping from the moving bus?\n\nHe wants to get off just before crossing the road instead of just after. I'd guess the times it's worked are when the bus is stopped for the light, not moving.", "That usually just means stop at the next stop.  If no one says to stop, and no one is waiting for the bus there, the bus driver can skip the stop to save time.\n\nIn most urban routes, they don't just stop as soon as you hit the button.", "Relax", "In my city it works the way OP\u2019s bus works. They only stop at specified bus stops, so when you pull the string it\u2019s a request to get off at the next one, not wherever you are at the time. We are a pretty dense area and the stops are usually not too far apart, though, if you miss your stop it\u2019s often maybe just a five minute walk between them, longer the further you get from the most populated areas.", "Wasnt it If you want to get out at the next scheduled stol and not in the exact place where bus is located when you pull it?", "Bus stops are designed for the public, not that one passenger's convenience. \n\nYou can't just start dropping everyone off wherever they want in the middle of Chicago traffic. \n\nIf he wants to be dropped off at a specific location of his choice, taxis exist for a reason.", "What backwater do you live in that the public gets to demand where the bus stops?", "It's literally a matter of safety", "So two issues here\n\n1. He isn\u2019t being polite.  He waits till the last moment, yells at the bus driver to open the door, then tries to force the door open when he doesn\u2019t.  He does this every day, and based on OPs post he has never politely asked or talked to the driver quietly ahead of time\n\n2.  Bus stops\u2026 are the designated spots\u2026 that\u2019s how it works\u2026. Buses aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s personal Uber service.  The idea is we have designated drop off and pick up spots so that it\u2019s optimized for all people, if everyone is allowed to hop on or get off whenever they want bus services would be horrendously slow and not work.  Now during inclement weather or a late night, could you ask a driver to maybe stop a bit early and may they do it? Yes.  But those are extenuating circumstances and not during every single route\n\nI\u2019ll also add this affects safety and liability.  Stoping suddenly on a busy street with no bus stop warning could lead to a wreck.  And if a wreck is called or the police get angry, who\u2019s liable? Not the person who thinks there the main character, but the driver.\n\nIf this person wants a stop there he should talk to the city or explain his situation to the bus driver.  Not yell commands and try to force it", "You think op should go to bat for one guy and try to force policy changes and add extra stops? For ONE guy? Lmao FOH, they can cross the street like literally everyone else who has to get off at that stop, or any stop, and walk. A driver here (NYC) *might* give you a break and let you off between stops if it\u2019s the middle of the night and no one is around, but on a crowded bus midday? Tough luck bro, go buy a car/Uber or move to rural Wyoming if you\u2019re too startled to walk across a busy street", "Safety.  There is no bus stop or traffic infrastructure there.  Other cars do not know or expect the bus to suddenly be stopping in the travel or turn lane.  You are now blocking traffic for however long it takes for this guy to get off, including causing other drivers to miss the light and drive recklessly to get around you.  You don\u2019t stop before a traffic light.  When possible, you stop after it to not impede flow through the intersection.\n\nLiability.  The bus is insured and probably legally required to stop only at designated stops.  The driver is the one to get a ticket from a frisky cop for impeding traffic and the driver is the one to be sued if they are hit or hit someone else.  You are only covered under insurance if you follow the rules insurance is designed to cover.\n\nLogistics.  Busy urban bus routes are tracked via GPS.  Your phone can tell you where a bus is and when it is supposed to arrive.  They are spaced to arrive every so often and stopping extra throws that off.  I have been kicked off a bus because traffic was so bad the following bus was catching up.  Our bus needed to return to the start of the route to re-establish the intended spacing between buses.  I guarantee her bosses can notice an unauthorized stop and penalties will follow.", "Guy is trying to forceabley open the doors after being told No. Passenger is definitely an AH. He gets on that bus every day he knows where they stop.", "Delaying the bus route to varying degrees. If he does this when the light is green, it could turn red as the bus is stopped, delaying the route however long the red light stop is. If he does it when the light is red, most of the time it won\u2019t make a huge difference, but it sets the precedent that he can do it every day. Which is why I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m an asshole or not", "Check your Job rules I'm pretty sure it's forbidden for liability issues to let anyone out outside of the marked stations. \n\n\nNTA and also ask what you should do with the passenger - you might need to call the police because he is trying to damage the bus", "I am currently training to be a school bus driver, and we have to let everyone out at their designated spots. There is no compromise because the stops are set up for safety. You are absolutely doing exactly what you are supposed to do. You have to tell him to stop and tell your supervisor that this is happening. He may get banned from the bus if he continues.

I take the X9 and more often than not there will be someone who tries to get off at one of the 9 stops, not realizing that the express has fewer designated spots. Regardless, NTA.", "My dad worked for the CTA.  Years ago, he told us kids about the \"spotters\" that specifically watched to ensure the bus routes were followed and stops were made at the bus stops; that if there was a bus just idling, the driver was probably ahead of schedule, etc.  Exceptions were made during severe snowstorms or in an emergency; or if a driver saw you running to catch the bus, the driver might stop.  But otherwise, no, the bus picks up and lets passengers off at the bus stops.", "Boston here and I laughed out loud imagining someone asking a bus driver here to be let off at the spot of their choosing. This is really going to depend on the city, the transportation department and the routes.", "Where I am, busdrivers usually are fine with stoping where you need to go on rural routes - no trafic, no schedule issues with a person jumping off early who would have likely been only one going off at next stop anyway, but NOT in the city. For too many reasons to count.", "I got very used to the buses in Austin, that will let you off at the nearest safe stopping point after you request it (except for the express routes). Now I am in a city where they only let you off at designated stops and I hate it. But the bus drivers aren't the ones making the policy.", "Yeah, i live in a decently large metropolitan city, and there is absolutely *zero* way that a driver would pick up or drop off someone outside a designated stop. I think mostly it's a legal liability; if you make an exception and homie trips, falls, and cracks his skull open like a coconut, guess who's to blame? You/the bus company. \"Why did you drop him outside the designated location? Those locations were put there by city planners that have done surveys for safety. Are you a certified city planner? Did you inspect the area that you stopped at for safety?\" Etc etc etc. My wife is a lawyer, and trust me when i say this:\n\n\n#DO NOT DO IT", "Absolutely!! Isn't it interesting how the geography changes everything? We also thank our drivers when they let us off without fail, that would be a faux pas", "I actually ride the bus because it's cheaper than owning a car. Not cause I fucked up in life \ud83d\ude44", "The person you responded to is right, this happens a lot on rural routes. But then there are also not that many places where people want to get off, so it's not a big delay. Usually just at one of the few smaller rural track-roads that join the main road. \n\nDropping passengers off where they want va at the stop means that they don't have to walk 1-5 miles along a busy road with no pavements and lots of blind spots. They still usually have to walk 1-3 miles along the smaller road anyway, so it's nice of bus drivers to help them out. \n\nUltimately I think it's just a case that the rules are different in rural areas, by necessity. Not that people don't want to follow the rules. Just there's no point following urban rules in a rural area in this case.", "I mean. I live in a good sized metro area  that up til 2019 didn't have assigned stops at all. Just any corner on the designated route and they always made time just fine.

When my daughter started ar a new school in first grade the stop was supposed to be at the end of our street.

I didn't know, I just saw her and asked if it was for that school so I assumed I was mixed up.\n\nWell, it was one street closer to a busy intersection and that year there were more kids walking from the opposite direction. So her changing it made everyone else's walk longer and closer to all the traffic at the light. People stopping for the bus qould be blocking the traffic at the light. \n\nA week into the year the driver sent a letter home saying the stop was at the end of my rode. That it was a safety issue and she would not be pickingnup or dropping off anywhere else. I guess that mom thought I said something since after it changed I could just sit in my yard and watch her instead of bundling up my 2 babies and walking her around the corner where I couldn't see from my house.
