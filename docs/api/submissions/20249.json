Enter my sister, who has always had a knack for thinking the world revolves around her.\n\nShe has been entitled to have everything since the day she was born. To taking my toys and me not having a say because \u201csisters should share\u201d to my high school boyfriend cheating on me with her. Her explanation: he liked her more than me because she was prettier. \n\nRecently, she came to me with the request of using my vacation home for an entire month. She expects me to just hand over the keys to my hard-earned property like it's some kind of free hotel. Naturally, I couldn't fathom the entitlement dripping from her words.\n\nI tried to explain that the vacation home holds a lot of sentimental value to me and that I'm not in the business of giving handouts. I expect her to pay rent for the month that she stays in there. But does she understand? Of course not! She threw a massive tantrum, accusing me of being selfish, heartless, and all sorts of colorful names.\n\nWhat infuriates me even more is that she has the means to afford her own vacation rental, but she's too cheap to spend her money on anything other than designer clothes and extravagant nights out. Yet, she has the audacity to come running to me, expecting me to foot the bill for her luxurious beach getaway.\n\nThe fallout from this argument has been catastrophic. Our family is divided, with some accusing me of being a stingy control freak while others applaud my refusal to enable my sister's entitled behavior.\n\nSo, Reddit, I ask you, am I the asshole? Should I stand my ground and protect what's rightfully mine, or should I cave in to keep the peace within our family?

She, and your family, have made no contributions to your vacation home. Tell her if she attempts to access it you will get law enforcement involved.  I would recommend getting a set of security cameras for the home as well.", "Personally, petty little me wouldn't even offer to rent it to her for the month.  Because, she sounds like the type of person who wouldn't take care of it, and wouldn't appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nShe is removing your ability to use YOUR vacation home for a month of course she should pay.  Look up average AirBnb rentals in the area and that's what a month's rent should be.", "NTA. No one is entitled to your property. It\u2019s  your property you get to decide who is and isn\u2019t invited. Also enabling entitled people just makes them worse", "NTA . She is not only entitled, she is also a creep, WTH?! seducing your boyfriend?! . \n\nI say you go to your beach holliday retreat and block her until she learns boundaries, you are better off without her.", "NTA\n\nIt's your vacation home. Ignore the haters because if you agree, they'll feel they're entitled to a free months stay.", "NTA.  At this point, even if she changes her mind, don't rent it to her.  If you do, payment up front.  She certainly won't treat the property well, and could do a lot of damage out of spite.  Think huge parties and their aftermath.", "NTA. Stand your ground. \n\nAlso, yes, I know it was high school. But cheating with your bf? Man, I wouldn't even let her rent the place!", "NTA you worked your butt off for your piece of paradise. She didn\u2019t", "Nta and cut this poisonous little brat out of your life for good.  She slept with your bf and told you it was because she was prettier???  That should have been the end of the relationship FOREVER.  Cut her out and any family member that doesn\u2019t support your decision.  \n\nGodspeed.", "NTA. \n\nNext time she or anybody asks about the vacation home day you\u2019ve already rented it out. If you\u2019re feeling generous tell her you\u2019ll cancel the rental if she can pay double.", "NTA. It's YOUR house and this is not even an emergency-kind of thing!\nI mean, me and my brothers share the property of my late father's vacation home, and anyway we ask one another so that er can get privacy or not!\n\nYOUR HOUSE!", "NTA \n\nYou were willing to let her stay if she paid for it. You're not refusing to share. She refused.", "Obviously not, your sister struggles to understand appropriate boundaries and enabling it would be terrible for both of you. Plus that shit is yours.", "NTA. Stick to your guns.", "NTA.  Entitled people are entitled to nothing.  \n\nYou worked hard for your house and should do with it as you please.  That can include limiting who has access.  Giving in to your sister only sets a precedence for continuation of this behavior.  And I'm guessing that if she does use the house that there will be items missing or damaged that of course, \"she didn't do.\"\n\nIf you do cave and allow her to rent the property, get the $ before she uses the house and make sure the $ is actually there and not a check waiting to clear type of situation.\n\nSis wants a vacation home, tell her to check the MLS listings and contact a realtor.  Airbnb or VRBO are other options for her.", "NTA. The selfish and heartless comments are especially odd coming from her. \n\nLet me guess: the family that agrees with her include relatives who suggest family parties on your property, or think everyone should have equal and free access to it as \"family property\", or they are younger relatives who don't yet understand that things like this cost money?", "NTA, \n\nI'm sorry but why are you even entertaining your sister like she hooked up with your BF, high-school or not, just kids idgaf who does that, and did she even say sorry or just \"its not my fault I'm so pretty?\" Edited to add: Geez she hooked up with your BF when she was 21, that's way old enough to know not to do such a crappy thing to your own sister. Why are you still even speaking to her, especially since she clearly hasn't changed and still thinks what's yours is hers.?\n\nRegardless of your relationship with your sister NO ONE is entitled to your things, and the fact that after you said no she called you a bunch of names, yea in no way should you give in. \n\nShe also doesn't seem like the type to not care about your space, if you let her use it she's going to make a huge mess and leave it for you to deal with.", "If you cave in, you'll be doing it the rest of your life.
