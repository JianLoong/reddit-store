Truth will come out tomorrow.", "That you can blame how the boss found out on other vague sources. I don\u2019t know your industry but for example. \n\nWhen people quit a job companies often sit down to ask why and how to improve. Quitting employees often provide unfiltered answers and anyone who quit recently could have provided information. \n\nCompanies should be doing looking at sales data on a semi regular basis. Sudden drops, lead sales people magically producing less should raise eyebrows. (Data analytics). \n\nAnd IT has full access to your devices and computer at any time. They can easily see any emails sent, logins, pages visited, they may even be able to see where they have visited during work. All it would take is one supervisor to think one of these employees is wasting time and to ask IT to check it out for this to unravel. \n\nHeck. if your company called some of its customers and found out that they did buy from your companies staff but the sales went to someone else it would set off red flags. (Probably the easiest excuse)\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that there are a lot of other plausible ways the company could have gotten this information. That you can point people at.\n\nIf you are worried about blow back than maybe ask your boss to say in the meeting that to investigate dropping sales they had reached out to some customers and were surprised at what they heard from some of them. \n\nThan you can just sit back and say they were dumb asses and going to be found out eventually.", "This. Snitching isn't the same as whistleblowing, which has legal protections against retaliation, etc. NTA - you reported unethical behavior and now these full ass adults are gonna have to face the consequences of their own actions.

Freemasons.", "Unfortunately not much of that is relevant to my industry, at least not in my country.\n\nOur work is done almost exclusively on our own personal devices, we don't even have an IT dept. I'm a sales manager and I'm probably first go to person in the company for IT issues/maintenance.\n\nThe customers would only be in our system if the job had been done through our system. Until we actually do a job somewhere, they aren't registered with us at all. Everybody in the state is our customer, which would be illegal if it wasn't govt incentivised.\n\nAlso exit interviews aren't a thing for us.\n\nEither way, the fact remains that these guys know I found out today, and know I disapprove."]}
