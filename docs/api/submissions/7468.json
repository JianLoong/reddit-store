I have been in their lives since Sarah was 2. Sarah's mom Kate was a drug addict, when Sarah was 3 she lost all her parental rights because of her addiction. Kate left after that and didn't have any contact until Sarah was 17.\n\nThat's when Kate reached out to us saying she was clean and wanted a relationship with the kids. My husband Rob was against this but I wanted to give her a chance. We met with her and it turns out she had been clean for a while, going to therapy, and had a decent job.\n\nMike was against meeting her, and to this day insists I'm his only mom and Kate is dead to him. Sarah was more open to Kate and resented Mike for rejecting her. I explained that Mike was older and witnessed Kate at her worse so he has a different relationship with her. While Sarah only remembers her after getting clean.\n\nThis issue still caused a lot of resentment between them and me. Kate blamed me for Mike being hostile and resented me. It didn't help that Sarah started rejecting me for Kate. She stopped spending time with me no matter what I did and stopped calling me mom, I told her how hurt I was. How she didn't have to choose, she could have us both. I never had an issue with Sarah and Kate, I only had an issue with being rejected.\n\nSarah told me that while she appreciated me at the end of the day Kate was her and Mike's real mom. This crushed me, the final straw was when she didn't invite me to her high school graduation. I told her if she didn't want to be my daughter then fine. From then on she would be my husband's kid. Mike is NC with her as well.\n\n3 months ago she came over with her fiance (who we didn't even know existed) to invite us to their wedding. She said she wanted me at the bridal party but I refused. I told her we hadn't had a relationship in years because of her wishes, and it felt uncomfortable for me to take on that role when I barely knew her now.\n\nShe said she was sorry. I told her I wasn't interested. She got angry and said I had to be there because and I quote \"what are people gonna think when both my brother and my dad's wife aren't there? gramps (paternal grandfather) is gonna get pissed off too.\"\n\nI told her she clearly didn't want me there and only cared about appearances and being on her gramps good side (he's rich). I am not coming nor am I having a relationship with her. She started crying and begging for forgiveness but it felt like crocodile tears to me.\n\nAfter she left she kept texting me trying to get me to change my mind. On the day of the wedding, she texted that she was gonna leave an empty seat for me and that I was welcome anytime if I changed my mind. I still didn't go.\n\nRob is mad at me saying I ruined his daughter's wedding and made her cry, that all she wanted was me there and this was a chance to fix our family.

Once she has kids of her own, she realize the sacrifices you made, but if you allow the anger to fester and the relationship to continue to spiral, it\u2019ll never get there.\n\nShe\u2019s 100% worried about appearances.  That\u2019s all a wedding is.  She\u2019s worried your absence will take away from her day in the spotlight, that\u2019s not a misapplied thought, because it will.  When the person that basically raised you your entire life isn\u2019t at the wedding, how is that going to reflect on her?  People will talk and it\u2019ll absolutely take away from her day.

If I had to guess grandfather probably is already aware of that.\n\nDid your husband give her away, or was he just an attendant?  Did the stepfather take all the special father/daughter moments?\n\nI still stand by Sarah being manipulated by Kate either for ego, or as revenge against Mike for his stance on his mother.  She also wanted to look like the worlds best mom, and quickly discovered Sarah was the best option since Mike told her to pound sand.  There really is nothing you can do at this point.  You've been hurt enough, and now need to take care of your own mental, and emotional health.  Just be a bit more open IF Sarah ever comes to you honestly to apologize, and have a real relationship.

Just bye I guess.", "UPDATE: \n\n  \nSo I would like to clarify a few things. Sarah's relationship with Mike is NC because she couldn't accept his decision to cut Kate off. At first, Mike didn't support Sarah and Kate but I sat them both down. I told them both of them have very different relationships with Kate. Mike remembers Kate as an addict while Sarah only remembers clean Kate and both of them are entitled to their view of Kate.\n\n  \nMike accepted this and was okay with Sarah/Kate but Sarah couldn't accept it. She couldn't reconcile addict Kate with clean Kate so she refused to believe Mike and downplayed a lot of this trauma. Sarah said things like \"it wasn't that bad\", \"it was not her fault, she was sick\", \"she gave you life, you owe her\" etc. By the time Sarah was 19, their relationship became and is NC. Kate also couldn't accept this and blamed me for Mike not wanting to talk to her.\n\n  \nRegarding the wedding, Sarah reached out to me 3 months before the wedding (even though they had been engaged for a year) saying she wanted to come over. We said yes and she came with her fiance, who we didn't even know existed. Apparently, they had been together for 3 years.\n\n  \nWhen I say she apologized I meant she said \"I am sorry you feel that way\" which to her was an apology but to me, it's not. She also referred to me as \"dad's wife\" as in \"what would people say if my dads' wife isn't there\" not even stepmom. Dad's wife. She also mentioned her paternal grandfather a lot and how angry he would be. \n\n  \nIn the 2 months leading up to the wedding she texted me to change my mind but all she talked about was \"the wedding will be ruined\" \"grampa will be mad\" etc. Once the wedding happened she blocked me everywhere, I found out today her fiance blocked me too (even though I don't follow him, I only messaged him on Instagram because he has a public profile but I have been blocked. Same thing with Facebook even though we aren't friend on there.)  \n\n\nShe clearly wasn't genuine in her attempts to reconcile. And even if she was it doesn't mean I am obligated to respond. She was 18 when she stopped calling me mom, 19 when she went NC with Mike and doubled down on her decision. A decision she has held on to for 6 years total. She made her choice.

Being a parent means not being petty and being the bigger person when your kid makes a mistake because you love them. This feels like your true colors have come out and you never actually saw her as a daughter. Yes she was hurtful but not having your bio mom in your life and having a stepparent is EXTREMELY painful and difficult and confusing for a child and no one should be blamed for not handling it perfectly. You can't suck it up for something as special as a wedding? You can say the relationship isn't magically fixed and set boundaries while still trying to go down the road of repairing the relationship. \n\nI guess this is why having a stepparent can be so hard. You're showing that the love or alleged love was completely conditional and could be taken away with a mistake.", "Let me get this straight; b-mom left when she was 2, leaving Sarah no memories of ever being bad, came back when she was 17 (imo a very difficult time in any person's life, you're about to be an adult and that's really stressful, and already the concept of being about to move out and move on to next steps is a big difference in family dynamics) showing very clearly that she took all the steps she possibly could to try to recover and make things right for her kids even not showing up until she could be sure that she was at a place she wouldn't be causing more harm.\n\nSarah starts to get closer to her b-mom, and starts calling her mom and stops calling you mom. You tell her this hurts you, and she says that she appreciates everything you've done (doesn't tell me that she has any problem with you in that aspect) but that this is her bio-mom that she has no conflict with, never has, and is getting to know as a good stable mom. It sounds to me like she never dealt with having two \"mom\" figures, so she may not feel comfortable with calling 2 people mom. b-mom resents you because she thinks you somehow contributed to Mike not being around her (not the best, looks like b-mom still has some \"dealing with the results of her own behavior\" to cover in therapy) so it sounds like Sarah wanted to have b-mom at a big life event for the first time in her life, and at 17/18 recognizes the conflict between the 2 of you and maybe wanted to offer this to b-mom as an olive branch and invitation into her life. You respond by telling her she's no longer your kid because she doesn't call you mom anymore.\n\nSo for Sarah, the mom she grew up with all her life, has always called mom, and has always had a maternal relationship with, just told her she means nothing because in the first few months of navigating her b-mom being back in her life she didn't call you mom. So she feels pushed out and excluded (sounds like she also felt you didn't want to be around her) and in turn doesn't come over, not surprising.\n\nFlash forward a few years later, she wants to extend an olive branch, wants to include you as a bridesmaid in her wedding, and you tell her no because when she was told she was no longer your kid she didn't keep coming around and behaving like your kid (you also admit she came to yours less often to see her dad because being around you was now uncomfortable). She mentions that it would look bad to others that she has no relationship with you. This could be one of two things: A) she wants to look good to the people who ARE involved in her life and wants to keep appearances up, or B) she doesn't feel like you care what she wants (she's \"not your kid anymore\", remember?) and is trying to appeal to you by saying if you don't care what she wants, maybe you'll care about what everyone else wants. \n\nCall me naive, but I don't think you cry on your wedding day for someone you don't care about. I don't think you leave an open seat for someone you don't care about. You said that she stopped being your daughter and was now just your husband's kid years ago, and now she's noone to you (if your husband's kid invited both of you to your wedding, with no previous relationship between the 2 of you, you'd probably go to show support, so now she's not even being given the relationship of \"husband's daughter\"). \n\nI don't know if I'd call you an AH for all that, but I definitely don't think Sarah is the only problem here.\n\nFor reference, I did grow up with 2 of each parent, called my stepdad \"dad\" and my stepmom by her name for 8+ years, I would go so far as to publicly correct her when she called us her kids in public. And having 2 people in a single parent title role (2 moms, 2 dads) can definitely make conversation harder, did it ever occur to you that she called b-mom \"mom\" because it was easier than giving context every time she had a conversation when she's only ever had one \"mom\"?", "YTA - you both are acting immature but you are the parent figure.

Maybe she should have tried reaching out BEFORE.\n\nYou kinda suck for not even trying to accept her reaching out.  Yes, you were hurt, but she was 17 when she reconnected with her mother.  She likely felt she needed to offer the mother some sort of loyalty.  She was still young and confused. \n\nI do find the whole appearances/gramps thing suspect, but she seems to have tried to keep things open--empty seat/welcome.  \n\nYou could, now that it's post wedding, see if you could resolve some of your hurt feelings and see if there IS a relationship possible with a girl you helped raise for 15 yrs.(more years together than apart: 5-6yrs).", "YTA.

She could have gone and sat with husband Rob (bio-dad). She may not have wanted to be in bridal party, nor wanted to stick around for the reception, but it doesn't sound like it would have been the end of the world to go for the service.

This was 'gramps is gonna be even more pissed and is gonna nail me in his will and I want that money'. She didn't want you there. She wanted gramps to think all was well.

After 15 years of raising that child, one year of struggle & some hurt & OP takes the nuclear option of \"fine, I'll only think of you as my husband's kid from now on.\" Not \"I understand you are struggling, I'll always be here for you, etc.\"  \n\nBased on that, I find it hard to believe OP's viewpoint is entirely accurate.", "She is young, and have had a very difficult life so far.

Hopefully Sarah's children' won't have to see this in grandma.\n\nWhen (not if) that happens, you should have a plan about whether or not you will want to support her when she realizes you were her mother all along.

She's been so standoffish and disinterested in OP that her own brother doesn't want anything to do with her.\n\n23 is an adult. She could make amends now. What she did wasn't an attempt at making amends. She made that crystal clear.

She has room to grow, as we all always do, so hopefully she will because if she doesn't, she'll likely be planning another wedding later.

I didn\u2019t have contact with my mother until I was about 24 I think. The meeting was awkward, as she was visibly still not well, and to be blunt was like hanging out with a meth addict.

She\u2019s clearly not well and not proud. \n\nMy father on other hand got clean after a little stint in the pokey. He came back into my life while I was a teenager. But we are not close.

But rhe little times she was there, she manipulated me and brother, he even wanted to run off to her in thr middle of the night, asked me if im coming too. From then on my dad completly forbid her to have any contact wirh us, thank God. But it had already created a cracky which led my family to have many many fights over it.
