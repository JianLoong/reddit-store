She's a living animal, not an accessory that can be ignored until she becomes convenient to you.

This dog has a good home where it is actually loved, something it clearly won't have with you. And honestly I don't think the legal action is going to go as you think it will. You have not paid for the dogs needs in 4 months. In many states that means you abandoned it into his care. If he can prove he's been paying for all the care he'll have a decent case.  Not only that but if he is forced to give the dog back he can get awarded pay for caring for the dog all that time. Do you know how much it costs to board a dog for 4 months?

For more then 5 months he has been paying for vet care and food.  Do you really think a dog bed and one lousy bag of food covers 5 months?  You're... not a good person.

And just saying in most states after a certain time frame, animals can be considered abandon and put up for adoption so you no longer own her. You haven\u2019t spent any real time to form a bond with her and yet you want to take her to Japan? You are selfish, entitled and horribly ignorant if you think either governments are going to let you have a dog you know nothing about. What\u2019s her temperament? What sort of health issues does she have? How about the specific food she eats? You\u2019re not a dog owner. You\u2019re not even a pet owner. You can barely handle twins.
