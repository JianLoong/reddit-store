I think for me it hinges on:\n\n> we **celebrated** our six year being together anniversary. I decided to **surprise** A \n\nDid you already celebrate this anniversary on the weekend and then you decided to surprise A with more? Or did the date fall on the weekend, you and your husband didn't do anything to celebrate, and then you decided to surprise him? \n\nWhen he came home and saw that you had gifts and a cake ready, what exactly did you two say to each other? Did you tell him everything you had planned? Did he tell you about his plans with his friend? He had no idea you had made plans, so although it's disappointing, I also understand why he thought, okay, well, I already made these gym plans with my friend hours ago, so I'm going to honor the first commitment I made today. \n\nNext time you want to surprise him with something, you need to let him know there's something planned. Especially if he's the type to regularly make plans with friends after work, it's not fair to expect him to drop those at the last second all the time. A text message in the morning that says \"I have a special surprise lined up for tonight, come straight home after work\" is sexy, flirty, AND conveys crucial information about logistics.", "Info: you say \u201cwe\u201d planned. What did the two of you plan for this anniversary that\u2019s not your wedding anniversary? You also mentioned that he found out that you planned something sometime after he invited you to the gym.

It's nice that you celebrate all the little things, but when you get to my age, it just isn't always realistic to have all those other dates remembered.\n\nHe should've changed his plans once he found out what the OP had in mind (I mean, who *wouldn't*) but sometimes it's switch gears when you've got your mind set on something else, especially after work.", "YTA if you didn't COMMUNICATE that you (plural) were celebrating \"six year being together anniversary\".

Your REAL anniversary is 2 months from now.  Once you get married, all those other \"anniversaries\" don't count.\n\nI don't even know how you keep track of how long you've \"been together.\" Is that first date? First sex?  Moved in together?  Got engaged?  My wife and I sometimes recall those times but we certainly don't \"celebrate\" them.\n\nYou decided it was an occasion, but it was indeed a surprise to A.  He already had plans, so NO, he is not an AH for going ahead with his plans.  BTW most people HATE SURPRIZES.\n\nYou're obviously not an AH for planning a special night, but you WBTA if you make this a bigger deal than it should be.", "Was he aware that he was supposed to celebrate the 'being together anniversary'?  If so, N T A, he should have chosen you.

Like what? Gym is open everyday, anniversary isn't happening all that often, last time I checked? You're NTA and your husband sounds so obnoxious, it's difficult to even comprehend.", "YTA\n\nSounds like you didn't tell him you had made plans.

Day you met, day you first had sex etc? It seems you just decided \"today will be this day\", so he was supposed to cancel his plans.", "Well in fairness you have access to him and his dick 24/7 so giving him a few hours to spend with his friend and letting him have a life outside of marriage isn\u2019t that much to ask for no?  And he didn\u2019t know about your plans and also he did text you and ask you if you wanted to come along. So yes in this case you may not be the asshole but you\u2019re overreacting a little bit.", "Im shocked by the amount of NAH and YTA\n\nMy husband has NEVER forgetten the day we got together. The amount of people that allow people to just take them for granted in this thread is insane.\n\nRemembering special dates is literally the bare minimum and making excuses for them is the reason they don't. Either that or they just suck.\n\nThen for him to choose friends instead of showing appreciation for your surprises for him?\n\nYeah no.\nThis would make me incredibly upset and mad and he better GROVEL.\n\nNTA you expected the bare bloody minimum.\n\nHe should be embarrassed by his behaviour\nand people who are justifying him should be embarrassed about the fact that they allow bare minimum behaviour to not be given.\n\nI'll be damned if i stayed with a man who can't even remember important dates. That is just embarrassing.", "YTA, you plan a surprise, surprise, husband made plans with a friend (something he does I guess). Instead of changing his plans for your surprise he decided to stay with the friend that he actually made plans with. You also declined his invitation to join them but you decided to instead, go to bed and fight when he got home.", "ESH. Communication is key in healthy relationships. Neither of you are mindreaders. WHY didn\u2019t you text him earlier in the day(or even talk earlier in the week) to ask him to keep that night free for you to celebrate.\n\nYou don\u2019t say if it would have been a problem for the friend if he suddenly canceled last minute. Your husband could have probably canceled, but I also have to wonder if this has happened before where you make plans for him without talking to him?\n\nRecommend at the least getting a shared calendar and blocking off things like this. But even better, maybe consider doing MC to learn how to communicate better with each other.", "NTA. The problem with surprises is that sometimes it backfires when the surprised person has other plans. I wouldn't necessarily hold it against him if he forgot an anniversary BUT (and that's a very big \"but\") when he came home and saw that you had prepared something and still chose to hit the gym that was huge AH move from him. It's just gym ffs and something he planned a few hours ago and any half-decent friend would understand cancelling in such case.", "You NTA for wanting to be prioritized.  Is this a one time happening or is it more often? If it is I would suggest counseling. I will tell you this has happened all my married life( it has been 36 years of this) we are finally in therapy.  I know, all you redditors will tell me I should have left him along time ago. I agree I should have not let it go on this long. So I encourage Op, you are just starting out in your life together, don\u2019t let this happen to you. One way to address this is to start the conversation saying \u201cI feel this way when you did this\u201d. The ones who have said \u201cguys don\u2019t keep track of dates\u201d that isn\u2019t the point. It looks from the posting that her husband saw something special was planned for the 2 of them. That should have been enough for him to stay home. You need to have an honest conversation and explain how this made you feel. Ask him how he would have felt if the roles were reversed?", "No assholes here.  It sounds like a miscommunication.  Clearly, you were very thoughtful and wanted him to do the same.  It takes men a while to learn that.  My husband is great, but he is a last minute guy.  It isn't often that he surprises me with all of that.  We don't celebrate our being together anniversary, just our wedding anniversary, and the other holidays.  I highly recommend telling him how you felt, but understand that to him, he didn't think you would be hurt.  If you tell him what you want, you may get it in the future!", "Yeah, that\u2019s not a \u201creal\u201d anniversary.

I met my wife when out for my best friend's birthday.  I celebrate his birthday, but just mention and give her a kiss reminding her.  No party or dinner out of the normal.  But if I came home and my wife went all out with everything.  I would have called my friend and cancelled.  The friend should be understanding.", "NTA. If he saw you had simething planned he should have bailed on his friends.", "Info: Does this happen a lot? Him going out with his friends rather than spending time with you? If it was just this one instance, I would give it a pass. Yes, it's bad form to miss an anniversary, but if this is the first time it's happened, I would forgive him and move on.", "Nta that really sucks, something is very fishy that he didn\u2019t message his friend to explain what was up and then skip the gym. I would be very very worried about my marriage", "YTA he had plans and you didn't communicate your intentions.  You would have been better off to give him a kiss and tell him you would be waiting in bed when he got home.  Men don't want needy, whiny wives; they want loving, understanding, and sexy ones.  Shape up now or you will be divorced.", "ESH. Op sucks for going all out on a day that only had importance to her. If it was that important that it required a whole lot of effort by both parties, and the expectation was that the husband would participate as well, then it should have been communicated before the actual day. \n\nHusband sucks for going to the gym anyway after he came home and found the \"surprise\". Honestly, he was set up to fail by OP anyway. Had he stayed, he probably would have been in the dog house for showing up empty-handed to the made-up anniversary.", "\u201cThis past weekend, we celebrated our six year being together anniversary.\u201d\n\nINFO:  WTF?", "So many assholes in this comment section.

So for nearly 20% of OPs life, this has been a significant date to them. \n\nMy wife and I have been married for 21 years. Together for 26. We have celebrated both dates every year. Even our kids know the date we started dating. Our anniversary is 10/19. Nearly every day, sometimes twice, we either text or tell each other \u201cHappy 10:19\u201d if we notice the clock. \n\nSmall things over time add up to big things.

It wasn't their wedding anniversary, but it was still an anniversary.\n\nOP, my Dad and Stepmom celebrate both the day the had their first date and the day they married. There are 365 days in a year, setting aside two days to celebrate your relationship isn't much to ask for. Both my dad and stepmom love and cherish the other, and they have consistently prioritized their relationship over most anything else, especially over going to do something trivial with friends. They've been married 13 years at this point, together 16. They have standing date nights every Friday at their favorite restaurant, and they make sure that there's still romance to this day. What you're asking for isn't much, and frankly I worry that the bar has been set so low for what is seen as a healthy relationship that others who would call you an AH for wanting to be prioritized on a special (to you) day.", "6th year being celebrated?

Turns out he could care less if I cook dinner every night, go all out for his birthday/anniversary's, dress up in lingerie, do all his laundry, ect. I was doing what I thought HE wanted. He didn't want any of it. Same with him HE was doing what HE thought I wanted - working on my car, taking out the trash, doing yard work, all the shit i dont care about. \n\nI highly suggest a discussion about love languages, and the needs/expectations of eachother.", "NTA \n\nAs soon as he knew you had planned the evening he should have cancelled the mates.\n\nBet he didn't evdn havd an anniversary card for you let alone said happy anniversarry\n\nYou Husband is a grade A AH", "YTA, how was he supposed to know?

A thoughtful husband would also have called to ask if it was OK for him to hit the gym later before making plans (knowing that, if you hadn't had any specific reason to refuse, you, as a thoughtful wife, would have said \"that's perfectly fine, I'll see you in a bit, love ya\"). If you'd said no for whatever reason, even \"I've had a rough day, I could do with a cuddle\", that was his cue to take a raincheck and to get straight home to pamper you.

There\u2019s no way he could\u2019ve known what you were planning because you leaned too hard into the surprise, so he made plans himself. He doesn\u2019t suck for that.

He should\u2019ve done the gym like he planned then gone home. \n\nBut yeah you can\u2019t be mad at him for also respecting his friends.

So let me get this straight: you plan to surprise him but he was asked to go to the gym and accepts. But he comes home, seeing you had some special planned and he still goes to the gym? WTF is wrong with this guy? The reason why is not relevant. I see my wife has something special planned for us I am cancelling on the buddy. Don't need to go into details just say something came up.

My wife and I can't even agree on what our first date was.  We met on Dec. 20. She \"came by\" on July 12.   First dinner at a restaurant August 2 (and first kiss).  Didn't sleep over until weeks later. We didn't live together before marriage.  So what date did we \"get together?\"", "These replies threw me off, too. My husband and I do something on both anniversaries every year, and I'd be really bummed if I planned something and he blew me off to go to the gym. If you don't have a clear anniversary date that's one thing, but if this is anniversary #6, I'm assuming they've acknowledged that date before? So why would they stop celebrating because they're married now?", "As a woman who has been married for nearly 20 years, I have no idea of what date my husband and I had our first date, first kiss, first sex, or anything. I know it was winter and I\u2019m pretty sure we got engaged sometime in winter around Valentines Day but not on it because I think Valentines Day is stupid. So sure, lots of people are like you and OP who think these things are important but many others just don\u2019t care. I know when our wedding anniversary is because we both feel that is the special day. Not everyone needs to celebrate or recognize those occasions.", "That anniversary absolutely still matters and is celebrated by a lot of people. I\u2019ve been with my man for 10 years and you better believe we will still celebrate that decade or more on that date too once we\u2019re married.", "When did a nice meal, a glass of fizz, possibly a present if we can think of something meaningful and \"something more\" become a chore? Hubby and I picked a wedding day 6 months away from our first date anniversary so we could celebrate twice a year!", "lmao this comment is so unwashed.", "OP didn't say 6 months. They said 6 years of being together so I guess anniversary of first date or of when they became an official couple.", "It's not their sixth month anniversary... six YEARS", "It wasn\u2019t a wedding anniversary - it was a celebration of their \u201csix year being together.\u201d They\u2019ve been married for 10 months. Seems kind of excessive to celebrate how long you\u2019ve been together AND a wedding anniversary each year and they are so close to each other in date.", "I\u2019m not a gym rat so the most I\u2019ve spent there is almost 2 hours in the gym so hypothetically he went from 6-8 with his friend arrived home around 8:30 and wanted to rest and assuming the wife was mad she wasn\u2019t in the mood anymore she spent the evening in bed", "After he saw what she put into it, yes.  He can go to the gym anytime.", "My, don't you sound like a real catch...", "If I was given the choice of going to the gym with this guy's \"friend\" or spending an evening in with his wife, I know which one I'd choose. NTA", "She said it\u2019s their 6th \u201cbeing together\u201d anniversary, so they\u2019ve had the chance to celebrate it before.", "And that\u2019s fine. But they both decided to celebrate it at some point. Most couples celebrate their wedding anniversary and at most go to dinner together or get a card for their first date anniversary. My parents have been together for 43 years and they only celebrate their wedding anniversary.", "I mean\u2026as a woman who has been married for nearly 20 years, I agree with this man. Like my husband and I generally remember these things and might mention it during that month or something but we certainly don\u2019t celebrate our dating anniversary. I actually have no idea when we had our first date. So this comment isn\u2019t that out there and he\u2019s not saying she\u2019s an asshole for it. They just are clearly early in their marriage and haven\u2019t worked out these things yet. But it shouldn\u2019t be some huge deal in the scheme of things.", "It sounds like he was only stopping in to change really quick. It\u2019s possible that the friend was already at the gym waiting, in which case it\u2019d be kind of rude to cancel at that point.\n\nNow, I could understand why OP might expect him to cancel if it were a hot meal or something that otherwise wouldn\u2019t keep, but it\u2019s not like cake and gifts are time-sensitive. That being said, I don\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t honor the commitment he made to his friend and then celebrate with his wife in an hour or two. Like, if he had worked late that night, would they not have celebrated at all just because it wasn\u2019t happening exactly on OP\u2019s timetable? \n\nIdk. My husband and I do still celebrate our dating anniversary, but him going to the gym for an hour or two after work would not preclude me from celebrating with him, especially if I hadn\u2019t alerted him to it in advance.", "My brother in christ, the meaning of anniversary is \"the date on which an event took place or an institution was founded in a previous year.\" Marriage does not erase all previous important dates, it only adds to them. You're telling me that hitting the gym with a friend is more important than your life partner taking out the time to throw a nice surprise party for the both of you? So you show a middle finger to her efforts and shrug off the fact that you did not remember a date that was apparently important to her but not to you so you leave her alone and head out to do what, go to gym? Because dropping a text like \"Hey bud, I know we made plans to hit the gym together today, but I'm really sorry I forgot that today is our anniversary for being together for 6 years and I came back home to find out she's has a small surprise party arranged for us. Hope you understand. I'll try to find the next best date to hit the gym as promised ASAP\" to your friend is unacceptable?", "Tell that to my very happy parents that celebrate both their first date and the day they married. But then again, they both like and love each other, cherish the other's company, and prioritize their relationship over friendships soooo.", "Are there four more anniversaries?  Those all need to go on the calendar.  First screw. First fight. First make up screw. Miss any?", "I never said he had to. I said it's odd that he chose his friends over sex with his wife.  I'm just saying I would not be making that decision", "When you made it official to be together.\n\nSo i assume August 2nd when you kissed is when you made it official?\n\nCongratulations you remembered more dates then OPs husband", "Clearly you celebrate all of them.", "It\u2019s also not their anniversary anymore that\u2019s coming up in two months", "Not really - I\u2019m married for 13years together for almost 20- there is 3 months between our wedding date and our getting together anniversary. We have always celebrated both. Just a card and a movie maybe but always celebrated", "It is not exceaaive. My husband and I do this every year. And are roghether for 23 years married for 6. Make your time together special. Have a nice dinner. Watch a movie. Enjoy being a couple.... put eachother first", "That's what I thought.\n\nYes you have together six years. Great... Do a 10 year anniversary and preplanned it..\n\nSurprises are good for Birthdays and actual documented anniversaries so you can take time of work beforehand. \nCommunication is Key... \nIt is short notice, if he already made plans with friend.", "Exactly", "I'd have to agree, I can't even remember the month I met my husband let alone the date. Mind you I also forgot our first half dozen anniversaries too but in my family it was all about how you were treated all year, not just one day. I'm heading towards my 30th so must be doing something right.", "They're only following the regular pattern, and it's first step is to always alienate all the friends you used to have and only try to re-connect with them if you have trouble in your marriage or you have finished it. Friends are made to always understand when you're always cancelling your plans _because of the significant other_.", "Or at least act disappointed that they have miscommunicated. There's a lot between the lines that he didn't say but that's okay because what wasn't said speaks for itself.", "They could eat cake and have sex anytime as well", "No he can\u2019t. His plans were WITH a person. Not a solo thing. Respect others town.", "I thought that, but maybe he stayed out cos he knew he was in trouble with her and was going home to her in a mood. Stay out with his mates or go home to her sulking? Tough one. \ud83d\ude01", "Why? Because I don\u2019t feel the need to cancel my original plan for the impromptu ones made by my wife that could be rescheduled for a few hours from now", "The gym doesn\u2019t take forever he can still be home at a reasonable time and spend time with his wife", "Yes, but not since being married. Being married typically changes which anniversaries are celebrated, so even if their being together anniversary has been celebrated in the past, one would expect it to not be celebrated as of this year.\n\nBasically, it doesn't matter if they *used* to celebrate it, because most people (including OP's husband apparently) would no longer consider it their anniversary.", "Not relevant. This was a \u201csurprise\u201d, indicating that the husband didn\u2019t know it was coming. Your parents can celebrate anything they like when they\u2019ve jointly decided to do so.\n\nThat said, I would have canceled my plans unless the friend was visiting from out of town. Doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case since they went to the gym.\n\nStill NAH.\n\nI\u2019m fairly accommodating as a husband and prioritize my wife in situations like this. That doesn\u2019t mean that my way is superior to the OP\u2019s husband\u2019s route of sticking to a commitment made to a friend when a surprise is sprung on him last minute by his wife.", "It\u2019s not odd to turn down sex. One is not gonna be I the mood for sex all the time. While you don\u2019t directly say he has to have sex, it seems you\u2019re implying that if his wife wants to have sex he should. So again I repeat, it\u2019s not odd to turn down sex because someone won\u2019t want to have sex all time time.", "I \"made it official\" two years later when I proposed.  I wasn't on facebook at the time--maybe I need to go back through her timeline and find out when she decided she was \"in a relationship?\"\n\nSo \"got together\" means first date?  And first date means first kiss?  I always counted July 12 because she \"stopped by\" my place and we talked for hours.  I think she doesn't count that because she was on a date with someone else on July 11.\n\nAnd I remember those dates but we don't \"celebrate\" them.  I'm sure OP's husband remembers the date, but assumed that it was superceded by the real anniversary.", "I\u2019m assuming you two agreed upon this, not had a spontaneous \u201cread my mind\u201d moment, yes?", "Same! Together for almost 19 but married for 11 this year. We celebrate both in a pretty laid back kind of way.", "Honestly, for the first 5 years, this HAS likely been their celebrated anniversary. Couples dating celebrate their anniversary also. This is the first year that their anniversary changed. I don\u2019t think OP is being unreasonable. Could she have communicated better? Yes. But when he got home and saw she had something planned and she made a big effort to surprise him, he should absolutely cancels plans for the gym. The gym will be there every day. You should choose your SPOUSE every day, otherwise what\u2019s the point? \n\nMaybe my thinking is outdated, but your spouse should be your priority over friends.", "After he screwed up, I'm assuming the offer isn't on the table anymore.", "Like AFTER the gym maybe. :P", "Every single day in fact.", "Marie Antonieete is your answer?", "Because you seem to think it's normal to make after work plans without checking with your spouse first, for a start.\n\nBecause you clearly feel your spouse is just another person you need to fit into your schedule.\n\nBecause you treat a thoughtful gesture like an inconvenience.\n\nBecause, regardless of whether you're married or not, you sound like a guy who wants to live life like he's single and should probably stay/have stayed single.", "I guess, but if they celebrated this anniversary for the previous 5 years, I\u2019d at least check in with my wife to see if she wanted to keep celebrating it after getting married.", "You claimed it wasn't an anniversary after they married. It still is, just not the wedding anniversary. \n\nI'd have canceled my plans in a moment if I came home to my fiance having planned all of that, save very few situations. Frankly, going to the gym just isn't one of them. It also sounds like the gym plans, themselves, were last-minute plans.", "Lol. I'm gonna guess you are not married... when you are married you take what you can get when you can get it. Lol", "but when he got home and saw it, that's when he should have said oh shit, and stayed.\n\nand they likely have been celebrating this anniversary for the last five years before being married. if he expected it to change, he should have communicated. she can't be expected to read his mind, right?", "No. You need friends. And friends need to feel they are important.  A marriage without outside friendships is not a healthy one.", "But he didn\u2019t screw up she planned something he didn\u2019t know and made other plans it sucks but it happens but they could\u2019ve easily rescheduled cake and sex", ">Because you seem to think it's normal to make after work plans without checking with your spouse first, for a start.\n\nof course it is. What a suffocating idea of marriage you are suggesting", "So what was the surprise?  She did say surprise. Suggesting he knew nothing if this. So clearly he didn\u2019t celebrate it.", "It\u2019s an anniversary worthy of celebration if both parties agree. There are technically anniversaries for every sort of event, that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to go all out a year from now and be pissed that my wife doesn\u2019t acknowledge the anniversary of the very satisfying shit I had earlier today after my morning coffee.", "sounds like you have a sad sad marriage and should not be giving anyone any advice", "Because you have a sad sex life as a married man doesn\u2019t make it similar for others", "I\u2019m not and I don\u2019t have much of a desire to get married. But I have had plenty of opportunities to have sex, and I have turned a few women down. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s not odd to turn down sex if you don\u2019t want to have it. Additionally, you don\u2019t know they\u2019re sex life. Plenty of couples have healthy sex lives. Sex is optional even in a relationship.", "Not if he already had plans.\n\nI\u2019m saying this from over 25 years experience. Her expectations are too high. He wanted a night out with his friend. She wanted him to read her mind.\n\nBut the positive is that maybe they will begin to communicate better moving forward. If Redditors allow it, that is.", "It's one day their anniversary.", "He also didn't bother letting her know he made plans beforehand. She thought his schedule was open. I'd be pretty mortified if my partner had to choose between cake/sex and the gym,  and they chose the gym. I think that's what's upsetting op...", "Conflating celebrating the day they first got together to a morning shit puts you dangerously close to being an AH yourself imo.", "Lol. You will understand some day...", "Why does it have to be a choice? He could go to the gym seeing as he didn\u2019t know you planned something before he made his own plans and then come home to enjoy the great surprise", "Oh, I\u2019m way way past that line. I have no need for this sub as a poster. I know where I stand.", "You seem to have a hard time understanding that just because you wouldn\u2019t turn down sex, it doesn\u2019t mean other wouldn\u2019t. Again, it\u2019s optional. Even if you don\u2019t have a regular sex life that doesn\u2019t mean someone won\u2019t say no.", "Smh ... Okie dokie youngster.", "Hopefully, you understand that men  are allowed to turn down sex one day\u2026"]}
