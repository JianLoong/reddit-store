Whatever the length of your relationship, it seems like you have a good man who is willing to stick up for you and other women in his life. \n\nI can actually relate to this feeling somewhat because my wife and I eloped and her family did NOT approve, either of the elopement or apparently of the relationship itself. My wife stopped talking to her family for a while and I felt so terrible about it. Her brother wrote a really sociopathic letter to her attacking me based on a private diagnosis and her for not basically letting the family decide whether we would get married (this wasn't a rushed decision, we'd been together for 8 years by then, which I guess might be coloring my feelings here lol). She still isn't talking to him even though she's reconciled with others, and may never again. I still feel so horrible because I feel like I \"destroyed\" her relationship with her family. But the reality is it was already shaky, and something like that was going to happen sooner or later. You can't blame yourself for things that other people do, including making unfair demands of you or supporting abusive people within the clan. Your husband's family decided to rally around a sexual abuser and that has consequences, one of which may be that their relationship to your husband is no longer the same. It was going to happen eventually as long as your husband decided to be an honorable person and stand up to their protectiveness and denial of Tim's behavior, as he finally did. Don't beat yourself up over this or carry it with you. Enjoy your new marriage.", "NTA \n\nSexual assault victims are never the asshole when it comes to their attacker.  And constantly grabbing your ass, after being told no, is the absolute definition of Sexual assault. \n\nYou have done absolutely nothing wrong.  Tim and his family have ruined the relationship between you and your husband.   This is all their fault", "NTA - You didn't splinter the relationship, Tim did that. The rest of the family sticking up for him is just gross. You two should live your best lives and let your husbands entire family live their gross lives away from you by going no contact with them. Really, why would you want a relationship with people like that?", "Tim is a pervert and committed (I think it's borderline or full on?) Sexual assault on multiple people and he's not at fault because he's \"an alcoholic\"?...\n\nHunny, you're NTA. Your husband is not the asshole. Your husband's family is sick and toxic, and Tim needs to face the consequences of his actions.\n\nYou're hubby is a keeper for sure.", "NTA\n\nI would have beat Jesus into him if I were you. He sexually assaulted on your wedding day.", "Of course NTA! Wow is your husbands family bonkers! What about the other brother's wife, she didn't jump in to say \"wtf are you guys on about?! You know full well he's a lecherous drunk\"?! This is such a wild example of mass delusion.", "NTA. That\u2019s gross.", "NTA the sisters in law have also been victims of him, the parents are making excuses rather than acting. \"he's a borderline alcoholic\" isn't an excuse. it's another sign of how they are failing him. \n\ngo low contact with fam to let it blow over, keep in better touch with other victims and if MIL brings it up again, she's called you a liar you don't need to be gentle with her,   unsolicited grabbing of a woman's back side can be a chargeable offense.  tell her it happened and if he keeps acting that way he's going to end up on a sex offender's registry.", "This isn't your fault. Your husband's brother harasses women. He apparently does it to all women, not just you. He created this situation. Your husband was right to defend you. And something needed to be done. No woman should ever be around this man. So family gatherings were going to get disrupted by him eventually. If his family wants to protect a person who touches women against their will, they're not good people. Maybe your husband can at least fix his relationship with his parents one day, though if they continue to defend sexual harassment, that may be tricky. NTA", "NTA. Go through the wedding photos and see if there are any with Tim in the background doing his leering or anything else creepy. Any wedding video?", "NTA.\n\nI've (M) experienced the same dynamic with my wife's brother, just replace the SA with unhinged temper tantrums and targeting me when I call him out on his terrible behaviour. His father thinks he's a saint, and his mother, often a target of his abusive behaviour, downplays it and tries to sweep everything under the rug (this also includes her husband's abusive behaviour towards her which I'm also witness to). Extended family on that side either enable the behaviour or are too passive to take a stand. Needless to say there's currently no contact with the whole lot, and I'm pretty sure I'm persona non grata with most of that side of the family. Good riddance.", "NTA this dude is a creep and the family knows he's a creep and has decided that's fine.", "NTA. You should reach out. \n\n\"Better parenting would have kept your family whole.\"", "NTA....you didnt splinter the family...the family splintered itself by being enabling and ignoring tim's behaviot for 41 years...glad someone said something...wish some of the other wives would step up and say something after enduring tim..but if they wont..so be it...you and your husband set a boundry..if family chooses to not talk to you because they cant honor that boundry...then thats their loss.", "NTA\n\nTim ruined the relationship and splintered the family. You did nothing except get assaulted which is not your fault. You've done your husband a favour by helping him cut off these disgusting, horrible people.", "Info - what did the other brother and his wife say during all of this?  The wife who said it had happened to her too.", "NTA but his family is o my.. i dont even have the words for it. we can clearly see who the golden child is there! you haven't ruined anything. it is unfortunate that it happened. it is sexual assault what he does! not normal, and for surenot something to not talk about!, you should speak up and he s lucky you only spoke up and didn't press any charges.", "NTA\n\nThe guy is out of control, and I'm willing to bet that his family is completely aware of it.\n\nIt'd great to have a partner who respects you, and is willing to step up and protect you, no? You're better off with just him and ignoring the rest of the family.", "NTA x 100\n\n\"He didn't do that and even if he did, it's not that bad\"\n\nThat is the mantra of an enabler/narcissist. Denying everything while also downplaying what they claim didn't happen, in the same breath. His family have made their choice of supporting a creep. There is nothing you can do to convince them otherwise. They may come around when he inevitably gets sued or, better yet, arrested but I doubt it. Live your life knowing you, every woman you know, and any daughters you may have are safer because of you and your husband.", "NTA - you did not splinter the family - Tim did.  Where is your SIL that has also been harassed - why isn\u2019t her husband sticking up for her", "NTA at all.", "There was an entire social movement to fight against just such behaviors (Me too!).\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nPeople need consequences when they assault others, including those who support the criminal.\n\nYes, he commits crimes.", "NTA- his family enables Tim\u2019s behaviour and continues to make excuses. I\u2019m petty as fuck and would have done right back to Tim what he was doing to me. Don\u2019t like when I grab your dick a little hard and twist it? Too bad, maybe keep your hands to yourself then.", "NTA.  This is why SAs are underreported, because of creeps like this.", "NTA.  The family is defending the perpetrator to keep the family peace, this ensuring this creeps keeps up his pervy assaults.  You are brave to call him out on his behavior, and calling out the family for turning a blind eye and excusing his repulsive behavior all these years.", "You _did not_ ruin your husband's relationship with his family. His _terrible family_ did that. Mainly his brother who literally sexually assaulted his wife during his wedding (WTF?? I'm so sorry!!). But also all the other terrible people defending this dangerous creep. \n\n_This is not on you_\n\nNTA", "NTA - you did NOT ruin the relationship !!!!  \nYour BIL and his family did that.  \nWhy didn\u2019t the SILs stand up and say it\u2019s happened to them too ?", "What if Tim does this to a 14 or 15-year-old girl, and her dad sees it. ? Your husband's family is enabling sexual harassment. What if he did this to work? HR would be all over his tail ( pun intended). Family like your husbands make excuses when Uncle Al or Cousin Tommy put their hands down the pants of an 8-year-old. \n\nYou and your husband did the right thing. Stay strong; the truth never stays silent, NTA", "NTA. You aren't the asshole for setting boundaries. For speaking out. Your husband isn't, either. His family are TA for enabling Tim and backing up. They broke this, and especially Tim broke this, not you", "You need a judgement. NTA.", "I'm thinking OP's husband is likely grateful to have an escape route from this family.", "Bingo. Tim needs help for his alcoholism. BTW there is no borderline. There is NO excuse for his behavior.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. NTA.", "So...NTA.  You know your supposed to start with either YTA or NTA. Not doing so makes you TA.", "And apparently momma will enable, enable, enable.  I wonder where he got the idea that this was ok! /s\n\nNTA -  your body autonomy is not a battle ground for creepy tim.   Creepy tim can deal with the consequences if his actions.  Record any future conversations with him.", "Alcoholics are often narcissistics.", "I thought of exactly this with all the deflections.", "This isn't an accepted judgment in this sub /s", "This is what I was wondering, too! Did her husband seriously not say a word during the whole ghi thing?! And the SIL didn't either?! That is a messed up family. I know OP feels like this is her fault, but I have a feeling her husband has been done with his brother for awhile.", "My uncle grabbed my ass often when I was a kid. Years later I found out he also did it to my sisters and later that he first started with our mum when she started dating dad\u2026 so stay strong on this one, keep girls away and if you ever meet him again, watch him like a hawk. \n\n(What worked for me was keeping the distance. Can\u2019t keep your hands to yourself? We will greet by a wave across the room and I will never get closer)\n\nYou have a good husband and you were not the one that broke that family. That was tim and everybody defending him (seriously, ask girls around, if he doesnt do it to the younger ones as well)", "his family are protecting a sexual predator and offing poor excuses like 'he's a borderline alcoholic' which means they will not do anything. They've called you a liar. shelter with the other women he has molested -AND THAT IS THE TERM FOR IT and do not let them make his victims feel like you did anything wrong. they have been covering for him for years and someone has to stand up to him.\n\nNTA", "NTA this is absolutely Tim\u2019s fault and not yours, the parents and family enabling him are to blame too but a grown man should be able to police his own behavior so it\u2019s mostly on him. Someone should have, and judging by the families denial and excuses probably did, called him out a long time ago and put a stop to this creepy behavior before it got this far. A drinking problem doesn\u2019t excuse bad behavior, it may explain it but does not excuse it, this man needs counseling and his parent need to stop coddling him and let him have consequences or he\u2019ll never be willing to get it and definitely not willing to change.", "Continue thinking about your daughter. How would you feel if someone grabbed her ass and the response was:\n\n>They also said that I need to be less precious & that even if he did do it, it\u2019s not that bad at all. Nothing was resolved & they also said it wasn\u2019t his fault as he\u2019s borderline alcoholic and isn\u2019t ready to quit drinking.\n\nBeing an alcoholic is a reason for his behavior, but it's not an excuse. His ability to continue drinking to excess is not more important than the safety and comfort of the four women (that you know of) that he sexually harassed/assaulted at your wedding.", "Did your SIL speak up on your behalf?", "NTA.", "Narcissists are often alcoholics. FTFY."]}
