Whatever the length of your relationship, it seems like you have a good man who is willing to stick up for you and other women in his life. \n\nI can actually relate to this feeling somewhat because my wife and I eloped and her family did NOT approve, either of the elopement or apparently of the relationship itself. My wife stopped talking to her family for a while and I felt so terrible about it. Her brother wrote a really sociopathic letter to her attacking me based on a private diagnosis and her for not basically letting the family decide whether we would get married (this wasn't a rushed decision, we'd been together for 8 years by then, which I guess might be coloring my feelings here lol). She still isn't talking to him even though she's reconciled with others, and may never again. I still feel so horrible because I feel like I \"destroyed\" her relationship with her family. But the reality is it was already shaky, and something like that was going to happen sooner or later. You can't blame yourself for things that other people do, including making unfair demands of you or supporting abusive people within the clan. Your husband's family decided to rally around a sexual abuser and that has consequences, one of which may be that their relationship to your husband is no longer the same.

We\u2019ve finally had enough after our teen said he made her uncomfortable. We only see them once a year, and we\u2019re DONE. We will NOT normalize allowing creeps to be creepy because they are family. This is why women are afraid to speak up about sexual abuse and harassment.

Which I guess makes it \\*just\\* an excuse.", "I\u2019d almost be inclined to specifically call them out and tell them that for their daughter\u2019s sake, you hope they keep him away from her because it\u2019s only a matter of time before he turns his eyes to girls", "The only way to deal with people like this is the second he touches you you spin around and scream at the top of your lungs QUIT TOUCHING MY ASS! I'm not even kidding, you have to do it. Or OMG are you hitting on my 2 year old??? You got to do it every damn time! They'll either stop because they don't want you calling them out on it or they'll stay away from you completely... Like not even go somewhere if you're going to be there which is still a win. Lol", "Right after divorcing my ex I was the only single in a huge extended family. BIL started getting handsy. I privately messaged him saying specifically this was between me and him to please keep his hands to himself as he was making me uncomfortable. \n\nEither he blabbed to my sister or she saw the message and immediately BLEW UP our family chats and I was dubbed as a threat to the family and trying to play the victim? \n\nI've cut them all off.", "NTA. As Tim's behavior is not going to change, especially with all the enablers, this is all going to show itself in the end. \n\nNot sure if you will get any apologies but they will know you were right to stand up against it. \n\nGood for you and your husband. Doing the right thing can be lonely at times.", "NTA - none of this is YOUR fault.

Your husband clearly hit his limit when his brother groped his WIFE at his WEDDING, then proceeded to try it on multiple guests. \n\nYou did nothing wrong here. Not one thing. You are not responsible for his behaviour. You do not have to tolerate someone touching you without your consent. This man preyed upon you. \n\nNTA and I'm sure your husband would agree 100%.", "Thank you, I appreciate your words. It was a long time coming. Oldest and only girl out of five and always dubbed the scapegoat/blacksheep by my mom, my sibs all passively fell in line.

On the other I hate myself for feeling that way.", "When we were at family events with my daughter, the only thing he would ever say was \u2018how pretty she was\u2019 she\u2019s 2.5yrs!!!!!!! I would say, we use compliments that align with our values eg- that\u2019s so clever, you\u2019re so kind, that\u2019s very brave ect, but he continued to just call her beautiful. It always creeped me out so I stopped taking her to family events. I will not allow my daughter to be in the same room as him ever again.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nNot only are you not the asshole, you are a hero. Though it may not be apparent right now, there is a good chance that your self-advocacy has helped someone else in the family who has also been abused by your creepy BIL.

Next time file sexual harassment charges against him", "NTA. He sexually assaulted you and has continued to sexually harass you. He\u2019s not safe to be around and he wouldn\u2019t be safe around future daughters either.

Personally, I\u2019ve seen this kind of thing in two people in my life - my uncle and a friend\u2019s bff. Both were creepy touchy borderline SA alcoholic types. Both ended up divorced, alone, estranged, broke and died youngish from alcohol consumption. \n\nWhy? Because none of their immediate families or \u201cbest friends\u201d ever dare say anything to them. When I realized no one would listen or defend me, I just cut them all off. I only heard about how they died through the grapevine. \n\nGo NC or at least don\u2019t ever show up to anything where creep-in-law will be. Take care of yourselves", "NTA\n\nYour expectations are absolutely not \"too precious\". It's the most basic of courtesies to keep one's hands and comments away from someone else's body. And it's not a gender thing; this kind of behaviour would be equally inappropriate if a granny or aunt were doing it.  \n\nYour husband is doing what someone else should have done long before now.", "It sounds like the family was toxic to begin with. The husband was raised in that environment and didn\u2019t see the issues until his wife (who comes from a normal family) is the target of the bad behavior of the brother. It also sounds like the family enabled the brothers alcoholism. \n\nOP, by distancing the family, you may have just saved your husband from becoming like his brother.", "This right here! \nTim sexually assaulted, he creeped people out, he was inappropriate & alcohol is NOT a excuse.", "Where did you find this gem?

Your husband is 100% correct to want everyone to stop enabling. Its his families choice while he may grieve family loss sadly someone has to start his fall to rock bottom so maybe he can finally start the fight against alcohol.", "NTA!! I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. Being made to feel uncomfortable and receiving unwanted touching is nothing to ever feel bad about making people aware of it. Don\u2019t ever hold back just because you think it will ruin relationships. Speak up \n\nIt\u2019s a sad situation that he is on bad terms with his family but they are out of line. They will start to miss him when he\u2019s not around because of their screw-up. And it\u2019s their loss that they won\u2019t get to be close to you.\n\nAs my husband and I always say to each other, it\u2019s us against the world. You guys do you. Enjoy being newlyweds! And congratulations!", "you didn't, tim did.", "Plenty of people who can back up the claim, including Tims wife.

Nope.", "You did SO GOOD!! As a mom and as an advocate for yourself! This man was a danger to your daughter! Any time you feel a pang of guilt, remember that your husband has spent his whole life knowing this man and watching his family excuse his behavior and sweep it under the rug. Your husband has drawn a moral line in the sand and it is a shame that no other member of his old family stood on the correct side of it (the side that respects a humans right to consensual touch) but that is THEIR failure  NOT YOURS. Very much NTA", "The fact that he\u2019s terrorizing other women and possibly young girls in the family is what concerns me. The rest of the family is enabling it and this is just reinforcing in his mind that he can get away with it, no matter who he harasses.", "They are called enablers.  Ignoring the issue or excusing it, just makes life easier for themselves.", "What an AH of a mother you have.  I'd be dancing on her grave with you.\n\nThere is no reason to feel bad about your thoughts about her because she sounds toxic.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault the situation devolved the way it did. Tim\u2019s going to find himself up on sexual assault charges sooner or later. The family\u2019s abhorrence to intervention will someday bite them in the butt.\n\nKudos to your husband. It hurts to lose family, but it\u2019s worse to lose touch with reality.", "Sounds like you\u2019re better off not having those people in your life \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. You didn't ruin the relationship. They did it themselves. They decided to punish you two with the silent treatment for stating facts. Yes, facts. You have multiple witnesses/victims and they can deny all they want. They probably even know it's true (hence their it's not that bad bs) but decided to take his side. These people are not someone you need in your life.\n\nJust make sure that you let him decide when and if you two will make any efforts to heal the relationship. Be supportive and listen to eventual complaints of him about them but don't fuel his anger by making nasty remarks about them.", "NTA. Tell me if this is an inappropriate speculation, but I wonder if your husband and his brothers have previous partners who Tim has 'run off' with his behaviour, because a guy this confident in his family's support has definitely done this to way more people than you and your SIL.\nPower to your husband for taking a stand. Standing up to family is never easy, regardless of how necessary it may become.", "NTA.  *You* didn't damage *any* relationships.  Tim did that, by being such an asshole.  He groped you - his brother's wife - *at your wedding*??  He made guests so uncomfortable that they felt compelled to ask *the bride* for intervention, and other guests had to start acting as bodyguards?  \n\nAnd your husband's family *defended* him?  Tim ruined his wedding reception and GROPED HIS BRIDE, and they're saying *you* need to get over it?  Aw HELL no.  \n\nIt sounds like this has been a theme for years, possibly your husband's entire life.  You did nothing wrong.  Take his lead on how much contact to have, and make sure you're never within grabbing distance of Tim again.", "NTA They are enabling Tim right to the grave. Alcoholism does not end well. There is no such thing as \"borderline alcoholic.\" They need Alanon. You and your husband did nothing wrong.", "Wonder if hubby (or better his ex-wife) went through the same problem in his 1st marriage... Maybe hubby learnt from that to keep his family safe.", "NTA. Enabling bad behavior runs family relationships. You just exposed it and the family is doubling down a they've always been. \n\nI don't know what it will take for them to confront him. I hope to heavens he's barred from any young girls in the family.", "NTA.", ">It\u2019s happened too many times & he\u2019s fed up with Tims behaviour being swept under the rug, ignored & the excuses for him. He wanted the whole family to hold him accountable.\n\nThis doesn't actually have anything to do with you. Your husband is tired of his family, who all know damn well what is happening because it didn't happen but of it did, here's a list of convenient excuses which aren't any better!
