You married your man who defended you in the face of horrible behavior.   Your man is amazing.  \n\nPlease don\u2019t accept guilt from anyone.   Your are a strong confident woman.    It feels otherwise right now but this the true.  \n\nPlease think about what would happen to your children, if you choose that route, if this family were allowed to have contact.  I feel so strongly that all children, nieces and maybe nephews are at risk.  And the adults just sweep it under the rug.  This is the best thing to happen.   There will be pain, anger, broken relationships but that is the only way to protect the women being abused and to prevent the next generation from the same.  \n\n\nI am so incredibly proud of you and your husband.  If you are interested in reading things to encourage you.  Brene Brown discusses shame and courage.  Your courage is forcing them to decide to look at the problem.  Like mold secrets grow in the dark.  Expose to light and truth kills their growth.   \n\n\nHugs to you!!!!!", "NTA. He needed to be called out on his sexual abuse; and yes, that's exactly what it is. Imagine if he did that to random women in a store or at a concert. But his family thinks it's acceptable,  or at least excusable, because he is family? Have some random guy walk up and grab their asses and make sexual remarks and see what excuses they make for him.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried to handle Tim privately.  He got out there and spread his own concocted story to counteract what he knew was coming.  The family choose to be blind and continue to enable his bad behavior.  Their excuses are complete BS and do nothing to help the victims.  Surely your husband's brother knows what is going on as his own wife is a recipient of Tim's bad behavior.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and have nothing to feel bad about or apologize for.  Your husband chose to stand up for you to his family.  The family choose to act like a bunch of blind mice and allow Tim to continue.\n\nCongrats.  You and hubby enjoy your life.", "NTA\n\nAs a guy, I would say to forget the thought that YOU ruined anything. Your in laws are ruining the relationship, but based on the details you gave it would have happened over something else at some point anyway. I would be disappointed that a few, like the SIL you mentioned, haven\u2019t found a way to show some support even though they could confirm Tim\u2019s actions/comments.\n\nIt is totally okay to feel bad for your husband and what he is going through with his dysfunctional family.\n\nThe most important thing you can do is to let your husband know that you understand that not every guy would have had the courage to take on his family even if he was in the right, and that you appreciate how he immediately stood up for you.", "A Narcissist's Prayer\n\nThat didn't happen.\n\nAnd if it did, it wasn't that bad.\n\nAnd if it was, that's not a big deal.\n\nAnd if it is, that's not my fault.\n\nAnd if it was, I didn't mean it.\n\nAnd if I did...\n\nYou deserved it.", "NTA at all.

Good for him on siding with you and his morals over anything else.", "NTA way too many families feel comfortable protecting abusers", "NTA\n\nI am sick of hearing things like this, family overlooks absolute disgusting behaviors because it's not that bad, well it is that bad and good for your hubby to pick the correct side.

You just called out an unacceptable behavior that almost everybody in this family is committed to ignoring. They are so committed to this strategy that they are willing to make you into the scapegoat. \n\nIf it were me, I'd keep contact with all of Tim's defenders to a minimum, and I'd avoid exposing anybody I care about to Tim's predations.\n\nOh, also I want to point out that Tim's alcoholism doesn't excuse his behavior. I'm shocked anybody would think it did.", "Wow,  that was most of the narcissists prayer at the end there", "NTA Tim sexually harassed you and made several other people very uncomfortable.
