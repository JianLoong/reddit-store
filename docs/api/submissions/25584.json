Theoretically you didn\u2019t have any obligation to help.\n\nThough that was Remarkably shortsighted and self-damaging of you considering you have 13 more years of shared custody to deal with.\n\nThey can tell this wonderful gem of an explanation of your character to anybody, forever.  And it will be true.\n\nWhat are you gonna say to her when your daughter spits it out in 10 years when she\u2019s chafing at you for setting some moral behavior rule or other?  When she asks about the night her brothers grandparents both died?", "Alright, so this is a complicated situation with a lot of emotional baggage. On one hand, you're absolutely not obligated to care for your ex's child from his new marriage, especially given the strained relationship and the nature of his new partnership. It's understandable that you might feel little to no responsibility for the child, and you're not wrong to say that it's not your problem to deal with their emergencies.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, refusing to help out in a genuine emergency\u2014a double fatal car accident\u2014is likely to draw some harsh judgement from people around you. Whether or not it's your 'job' to look after the child, showing some compassion in an emergency situation generally makes you a more sympathetic character. It's a chance to rise above the nastiness of your previous relationship and, more importantly, it's a kind act for a child who is in no way at fault for the situation.\r  \n\r  \nAnd let's not forget, this could potentially have a future impact on your relationship with your own daughter. Kids pick up on these things and she may wonder why you didn't help her half-brother when his grandparents died. The emotional consequences of this moment could be long-lasting.\r  \n\r  \nSo, are you legally or morally obligated to take care of this child? No. Does refusing make you look insensitive and vindictive? Quite possibly. Therefore, I'd have to say you're somewhat the arsehole in this situation. Sometimes, it's not about obligation; it's about showing a bit of human decency in tragic circumstances.", "NTA because it was your right to say no. But imo it was petty of you not to do it.  The innocent child had to witness this terrible event that will effect the rest of their lives.\n\nI wouldn't have done it for your ex or his partner,  but I would have done it to protect the innocent child from potentially being mentally scared from this tragic event.", "While you\u2019re NTA because you have no obligation to help, it doesn\u2019t make you a good person either. \n\nThis was extenuating circumstances. It would have cost you nothing to help.", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t mean you did the right thing.", "Look you hate her she was f\\*cking your husband behind your back. They got married and had a baby together, no-one in the world is going to blame you for not liking her or wanting anything to do with her.\n\nIn saying that, how long are you going to carry around this anger for? Don't you want to let it go? At some point down the line, you may need a favour from him in an emergency situation with your daughter, don't you want there to be some level of grace between you two for the sake of your daughter?\n\nI mean there isn't any empathy for this woman who's parents just got killed? I know she and your ex did the wrong thing, but just seems like you maybe could have shown some grace and kindness in this very rare emergency situation, all you have done now is create a worse relationship between your ex and you, and it's your daughter who will suffer down the line.", "YTA. Luckily you'll never need a favour when it comes to raising the child that you share with him. The good thing about emergency situations is that they only happen to other people.", "I mean yeah, obviously it\u2019s not your job or responsibility. But it is what a decent person with a heart would do. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re technically NTA but I sure would pause before calling you a friend.", "YTA. You can still be technically right but an asshole.", "YTA. It was an emergency and you by your own admission could have done this. I completely understand being bitter but being the bigger person speaks volumes as does being petty. Your child will one day learn of this, how do you defend not being there.", "YTA. No one was asking you to forgive him for cheating on you or to get along with his new wife. This was a one time thing. That boy is your daughter's brother, like it or not. You treated him like a stranger and that behaviour has been witnessed by your daughter. Work out your issues for your daughter's sake.", "Your daughter's step grandparents died...and her brother needed care. I can't imagine being so callous.\n\nYTA", "YTA. He wasn\u2019t asking you to forgive him & no one is saying you need to. That said, this was a massive tragedy and their child is your child\u2019s sibling. Under the circumstances, I believe it would have been appropriate to put your issues aside. Your daughter witnessed this type of behaviour. You don\u2019t have to like your ex or his new wife, but your daughter\u2019s brother didn\u2019t do anything. Maintaining a good relationship with him is good for your child. Empathy & compassion under extraordinary circumstances wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss\u2026", "Does your ex suck for cheating? Does she suck for sleeping with a married man? Certainly, on both counts. Now that's acknowledged....\n\nAs much as I think you should have, as much as I know I would have,  as much as,  like it or not,  that kid IS your daughter's sibling and I think you need to make peace with the child's existence as part of your daughter's life and this wasn't a run of the mill emergency,  this was a unique tragedy....I have to admit that you had no *obligation* to help, so NTA....", "YTA. This situation is NOT about you. This is YOUR daughters brother. Also. This is truly an emergency.", "YTA a lack of obligation does not mean you are not an asshole in this situation. That was just cold and callous. I would be so ashamed of myself for being so petty during such an awful time.", "YTA. And it\u2019s really sad that you have to be told that.", "NTA, that was none of your business.\nYou could have been busy had other things going on or had your own emergency happening", "NTA. You do not have a moral obligation to help the affair partner or child. You don't owe these people anything.", "NTA put it this way if my ex had done me what your ex did to you mine would never have the balls to ask that question because he would be too scared of the answer. I believe in the full on scorched earth approach to cheating so him and his homewreaker wouldn\u2019t be asking me to watch their affair baby not a chance. You were quite right in what you did.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your problem. Im going to be honest, I probably would have said no. I\u2019m firm believer, not my monkey, not my circus.  Now with that being said, you could/should have done it. You didn\u2019t look at the bigger picture, this is your child sibling. You\u2019ve probably made your relationship with your ex even harder. It\u2019s a bad look, you look like your angry. \n\nNow, one day you might have emergency and need something from your ex, his answer will probably be no.", "No. It's a complete sentence. People that complain can watch their child without baggage being attached. So let them.  You're not a bitch and don't let them make you THEIR bitch. NTA", "Ok I'm going to go with NAH. Could you have been the bigger person? Yes. Not being the bigger person makes you an AH? No. Quite frankly I find it odd that he went to you to ask for that favor but I'm going to put that on the desperation he must have been feeling, so I wouldn't say he is an AH for asking. \n\nThe people judging or criticizing you for refusing to look after the child for a hole evening or even more, saying you should have put your feeling aside, most likely haven't been in such a complicated situation, it's easy to say \"I would have done it\", \"the child it's not to blame\" when you are an outsider.", "You can tell them the people that are saying this that they should be the one watching the kids if they feel that strongly it's not up to you to take care of other peoples problems. He could stayed home with the children and she could've gone to the hospital. it's not up to you to take care of their children only yours.", "INFO: Who are these \"people\" who you say are calling you an AH? How did they \"find out\"?", "He may not have been your child, but he is your daughter's brother, and as innocent in the whole situation as your daughter is. If you keep treating her brother like this, she's going to notice as she gets older, and that could cause some major problems later in life for all of you, especially if she (shock horror! for you) loves her brother. \n\nIt was your choice, sure. But remember, _all_ of our actions will have consequences. No matter how justified you feel right now, no matter how self-righteous, you have no right to complain about the majority of consequences that are likely to come your way because of this choice. You have strained your relationship with your daughter's father for what is, admittedly in my opinion, a petty reason. This is not going to make your co-parenting relationship easy, and again, your daughter will pick up on this. You were thinking about how you could hurt your ex and his wife. You didn't give a damn about your daughter or her feelings, nor those of her equally innocent brother.", "This is a stupid comment. If anyone here calling her an AH had any knowledge of who this person is, they would have watched the baby.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what being NTA looks like in this situation.", "That\u2019s the question.... who are these people? Appears ex didn\u2019t have an issue with OP saying no. There\u2019s no conflict in this.", "It\u2019s time like these I wish they had the justified asshole verdict.\n\nBut they don\u2019t so NTA would probably be closest", "Stfu. They are in no way the AH for refusing to look after an affair baby after the mistress had a bad thing hapoen. Compassion??? Please.", "She did. Why do you feel comfortable leaving your child with someone you\u2019ve scorned?", "No cause when it\u2019s an emergency on her part it\u2019ll be \u201cHe\u2019s her father so it\u2019s his responsibility!\u201d", "I get what your saying, but- I had close to the same divorce.

They can have contact with HER (we were social and knew each other- knew he was married) but don\u2019t bring her to my house", "Wtf? If it was their child that they shared then yes she should have but she has no relation to that child. She's not responsible.", "But she\u2019s not their friend. Why is it her responsibility to take care of their affair baby that they had while she was married to her husband? I have plenty of friends who have helped with our chin emergencies. Maybe it says something about 2 cheaters who have no friends to help?", "But she most likely is a stranger to the kid\u2026", "You can be a doormat but OP is right.", "Take my upvote. \nYTA - this isn't about you and your ex's relationship. Like stated above, this is your daughter's brother. This ia also an innocent child. Giving them a safe space during a traumatic event is a humane thing to do. The child can feel the stress & angst in the parents, especially in his mum. \n\nThe ex and his wife are grown up, so you don't need to care a single ounce about them. The child, however, needs somebody and being with his sister would help ground him.\n\nI think in a community sense, we as adults, can care for any child that needs help. If a child is lost or hurt, we step in to care. In this situation there is obviously a higher level of care because you can & he is just a child.", "I don't. Why would they even ask her to take their child. But maybe I'm a b**** and I understand  that. But it would never happen that I would watch the AP child. She doesn't need a relationship with that child. As long as she doesn't stop the relationship her child has with the child...she stays out of it.", "She\u2019s not family or a friend, and probably has less of a positive relationship with her ex\u2019s partner then a random stranger on the street.\n\nOp is definitely NTA but I\u2019m guessing from the name this is a troll account ?", "For the ex to ask op to watch his son I take it they have a great coparent relationship. the ex is the ah to ask op to watch his son that was conceived during their marriage. I understand it was an emergency,but who in their right mind would trust their child to be babysat by someone that they have betrayed.", "I understand your perspective, but it's important to remember that compassion isn't just about the adults involved\u2014it's also about the innocent child who has been caught up in a tragic situation. While the circumstances surrounding the child's birth are undoubtedly difficult, the child himself is not responsible for those circumstances. In an emergency like this, showing a bit of empathy for the child's well-being can go a long way, regardless of the history between the adults.\r  \n\r  \nOf course, nobody can force you to do something you're uncomfortable with, and everyone's emotions and reactions in complex situations like these can vary. But sometimes, taking a step back from personal grievances and considering the well-being of an innocent child can lead to a more compassionate and understanding perspective. It's ultimately her decision, but being mindful of the potential impact on the child and the broader relationships involved could be worth considering.", "I guess when it comes down to something that serious happening, maybe you extend an olive branch even if it\u2019s temporary.
