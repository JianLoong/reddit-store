Long story short, my brother is a long time addict who has been in and out of jail for the past 10 years or so. \n\nIn 2020 during a time he was in between jobs I allowed him to stay with me for a few weeks. After about 3 weeks I found about $300 I keep in a drawer in my desk missing. I confronted him and he admitted to taking it. Two days later I came home and found him passed out with a girl I had never seen surrounded by paraphernalia. I gave him an ultimatum and he asked to go to rehab. I drove him there and left, and he checked himself out and vanished within a week.\n\nSince then I've tried to check in on him, send him messages and phone calls or social media, and while I was able to see he would read my messages he never responded. It's been like that for two years now. In March he was arrested on another charge and is now doing prison time. Every couple weeks he calls me. He is bored and wants to talk to someone, wants contact with the outside world and all that, and being the older brother from all my siblings everyone always calls me. This time though I really am finding it hard to care. It costs me every time he calls (collect). \n\nHe called again today and I ignored it. He called three times through the day and I finally answered and as usual he just wanted someone to talk to. I dont want to take his calls anymore, im tired of being there when it's  convenient for him, but still an inconvenience for me.

(2) I have always been there for my family when needed, but as I've gotten older I feel like that is taken advantage of and not reciprocated. \n\nMy family doesn't care to take his calls, but they come to me asking what is new with him, updates on his case or sentence etc. It's just expected and they start hounding me If I haven't provided updates. I'm tired of being the go between and I don't think I should be responsible for communicating when he got himself in the mess he is in. If he is lonely and bored he shouldn't have gotten himself locked up.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Having any kind of positive relationship at all with an addict can give them a reason to get better, versus giving up hope or seeing no point in trying.  \n\nIf you want to be a positive influence on your brother, or to just know that you were there for him of the worst happens - then talk to him sometimes when he calls. Doesn't have to be everytime or every day.  If you're burned out and want to protect your time and peace of mind that's ok too.  \n\nThis has a lot of similarities to my life - brother is an addict, won't go/stay in rehab.  My brother also has schizophrenia.   Basically he is often very difficult to talk to. Hallucinations, angry outbursts.  But in jail is one of the few times he's been sober in awhile, so we have some good conversations too.  \n\nThe types of addictions my brother has make his risk of OD ing real.  So I talk to him when I think I can handle it.", "Please ignore his calls and please go \u201cno-contact\u201d once he is out of jail. Stop enabling him and stop allowing his toxicity into your life.

I can't chat.\" Repeat until he stops.\n\nShow him that you aren't going to put up with his nonsense anymore. You aren't being treated like a \"big brother\", you're being treated like an emotional support animal and a toy rolled into one. \n\nHe needs to show *actual growth*. Until he does that the cycle will continue. When he gets out, what does he think is going to happen? Because, if I had to guess by the frequency of calls, his plan is you.
