I just don\u2019t understand her after I grew up around nudity that I didn\u2019t sexualize. \nI only sexualize a partner.", "I do agree that the taking out the trash is weird lol, especially since she said they live in an apartment building. So is he walking down the stairs and to the trash cans in his underwear? What if he encounters someone on the stairs? \nIf I as a 23 year old woman living alone was walking up the stairs to my flat and I saw my adult male neighbor walking towards me in tight underwear and nothing else,  I would totally think he's a creep and make sure I get to my flat and lock the door behind me as soon as fucking possible. Good God.", "A body it may be, but bodies should be covered and decent around other people! Would you want to see your nan naked?", "Sure. Getting a hard on in general is normal, no problem so far. But to just prance around the house showing it to your kid knowing he is uncomfortable with it? That's fucking weird. There's this thing called respect, parents should have it for their kids just like kids are expected to respect their parents. This kid is uncomfortable with it and the dad doesn't care. I'll say it again. That's fucking weird", "I would call that relatively normal behavior in your own home. It\u2019s normal public behavior on many beaches around the world", "Not only that, it's probable that OP isn't American since they say \"flat\" instead of \"apartment\"", "You really need to read more. OP is a guy. \n\n\nAll OP\u2019s dad has to do is throw on a robe. Why is the dads comfort more important than the sons (given that one is the comfort of wanting to be nearly nude, and the other is not wanting to see an adult nearly nude)", "Well good for you but if you walk outside in such a state of undress and children see you then you can be in serious trouble. You do not expose yourself to your children just because you cannot be bothered to put clothes on.\n\nJust because your mom does it does not make it right. If your children express discomfort then you respect their feelings. You do not say my house, my rules because that just means you have no argument, you just want to be a tyrant.", "And I\u2019ll say it again, it\u2019s not sexual abuse. This guy might be an asshole or weird or even gross by many peoples standards, but he\u2019s not sexually abusing anyone by doing these things. \n\nEdit: you\u2019re also embellishing the hypothetical behavior here to push your point forward. Noted.", "You think it\u2019s normal behaviour for parents to show off their privates to their kids? Own home or not, no kid wants to see that shit, having your own home doesn\u2019t justify you being a creep", "[removed]", "He's a kid, living there, hard to avoid a father strutting around with a boner if you just wanna chill with the family in the living room. He's uncomfortable, he expressed it. Dad doesn't care. Now what? Even if it wasn't sexual abuse, which it is, but let's say its not..He's still a shitty dad for not respecting his sons boundaries.\n\nI am very curious though, would you still be equally okay with it if he did it to his 15 year old daughter? Not that the gender matters, but it might give you a different perspective", "I think sitting around in your underwear is *not* \u201cshowing off their privates\u201d.\n\nThink whatever you want man. This is not sexual abuse by any objective standard and no law will say that it is. \n\nHave a good one \ud83d\udc4b", "It\u2019s not sexualizing, NOBODY wants to see some guy in just their underwear. It wouldn\u2019t be a issue if he lived by himself. But he doesn\u2019t, he lives with his son. Therefore, it would be best to wear shorts and shirt.", "I would feel exactly the same. I grew up in a house with only women and they gave no fucks about being naked at any moment.", "Sitting around in your underwear is not, sitting around in underwear so tight that it shows off your junk and makes the other people in your house uncomfortable IS. How would you like it if your dad was walking around with his balls in your face every single day", "Ah, found the problem. I'm sorry you grew up in the same kind of environment. No wonder you think so easily of this", "Dude, you\u2019re talking to a guy that grew up in a house with only women, and no I didn\u2019t appreciate them walking around 100% naked on a daily basis. I also was not sexually abused.\n\nSeriously I\u2019m not engaging anymore."]}
