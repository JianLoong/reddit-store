Sounds more like you're just smart, and have figured out that people are driven by different motivators. If his is pride, and having his neighbors see him like that doesn't embarrass him? Family sure will. Plus you're 15. Ew. Good job", "NTA , this made me uncomfortable to read . I hope he continues to wear clothes that don\u2019t make his family uncomfortable . OP , no one wants to see that, you are not alone . I\u2019d never leave my room if I had to live with someone like that .", "NTA. This thread is going to get locked because what you are describing is sexual abuse and that's against the thread's rules. Look up 'covert incest.' Tell another adult you can trust (not your uncle obviously).", "NTA if you live with someone else it is common courtesy to dress in a way that both of you are comfortable with, he could have easily solved this by just buying a house robe or something.", "NTA. If he starts wearing no clothes again repeat it but let it be known that he doesn't do anything to hide his erection from his children", "NTA and I'm glad he started to wear clothes. It's perfectly acceptable to sit around your house in your underwear if you are there ALONE or with your partner (although I would ask my husband WTF he was doing lol). If I was at home with my daughters I'm not going to walk around in a bra and panties all day. That's weird and I would be really cold and uncomfortable.", "NTA that\u2019s disgusting \ud83e\udd2e he acts like a kid", "NTA\n\nI walk around my house naked-ish. I'm lazy, comfy, and sometimes don't want to \"waste\" clean clothes when I'm going to be sitting on the couch with a blanket. I think I'd feel weird coming to a dinner table though without at least pj's. I'm mostly talking lounging here.\n\nI definitely do not go outside like that, I try to avoid windows ffs. And if my kid or spouse EVER expressed discomfort, it'd stop, immediately.", "NTA. I can totally understand why you'd be uncomfortable with your dad walking around in just his underwear all day, especially if it's really tight, and certain things are exposed. That's grim. I understand that some people feel the standard Western attitude to nudity (and near-nudity) is uptight, but you're a goddamn minor and his child. Ew.  \nTo call him out in front of the whole family was a bold move, and I respect you for it. It seems to have worked \u2013 bravo. \n\nIn any case, it's not like you were trying to hurt your dad's feelings. You just wanted him to start wearing clothes like a normal human being. And it seems like he's started doing that, so mission accomplished, I guess? I hope he keeps his clothes on, going forward.", "NTA, my younger brother lives with me and we both dress appropriately to not make each other uncomfortable. Before he moved in I walked around in my undies but I don't do that anymore. Your father is gross and lacks boundaries", "YTA his house his rules, ever thought about moving out?
