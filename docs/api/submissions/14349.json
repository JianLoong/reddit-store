If someone describes their parents emotionally abusing them, they're not saying that the emotional abuse should be legally prosecuted, they're saying that the behavior was abusive.", "I would consider myself pretty sexually Liberal but this is 100% a form of abuse.", "Nipples are not genitals. Stiff nipples are not an erect penis.", "The fact that you just compared nipples to a penis is hilarious but also awful. \n\nOne of them is nipples. \n\nOne of them is an erect penis.", "I love how you keep not bringing up the erections. \n\nHow about we have a man repeatedly show your children his erection. Would that bother you? \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, if you're showing children your erections, convincing other people it's no big deal isn't the right direction to go. Get help.\n\nHow's that for ambiguity, you literal creep. Defending showing a 15 year old an erection, there's a badge to carry around. Get help.\n\nEdit: Check their profile and username if you think I'm being hyperbolic.", "If it happened once or twice on accident, maybe. But the fact that it continually happens despite the son asking him to stop definitely pushes it into sexual harassment and lewd behavior. It feels from the post like he is deliberately getting an erection in front of his kids and displaying it, which is  non-consensual.", "This is AITA. The main concern here isn\u2019t legality, so I have no clue why you\u2019re choosing this particular bill to die on.", "Except... it's not public it's in the comfort of this man's own home, I agree that if the kid is uncomfortable a compromise should be reached. However acting as if this dude is weird or deserving of shame for walking around in undies in his own home and sometimes getting an erection (ya know a thing that happens at random times even when you're not in the mood) is fucking nuts and a double standard.", "regardless of the quality of the comparison the OP is an AH", "[removed]", "This. Tell a trusted teacher or guidance counselor at school, OP. They will help you.", "I'm scandinavian as well. I often saw my father in his underwear while he walked from the shower to the bedroom to get dressed. That's normal in our family. Him taking the trash out in his undies, or walk around us with a boner has never happened and is not considered normal in our community!", "My family is and my dad often lounged around in his underwear at home whilst watching TV. Never really a big deal from it but there isn't the same prudish culture around nudity.\n\nPublic pools are a big thing here for example and everyone has to shower(no stalls just a room full of shower heads) nude in the changing room so you see lots of naked people from an early age xD", "I guess there are cultures that don't mind nakedness. But a parent to focus on sex is very wrong. Hope you are okay?", "Okay, believe what you want \ud83d\udc4d", "I\u2019m willing to accept this. I was defining sexual abuse as an explicitly illegal act, and many comments are based on reporting this to authorities.\n\nIf we\u2019re saying \u201csexual abuse\u201d is a subjective term meaning any behavior that makes someone feel uncomfortable and is considered sexual by that individual then sure, call it sexual abuse.", "Right? The argument anti-breastfeeding idiots use hahaha", "The only thing I got from this comment is that you don\u2019t have a firm grasp on the concept of ambiguity.\n\nThink what you want, just know that the law is not on your side.", "Woah now, you threw a hole big ol assumption in there. It *feels* like he\u2019s doing it on purpose? If that\u2019s true I\u2019m with you 100%, but I don\u2019t think we can make that assumption. I did not get the impression OP thought his dad was actively sexually harassing him, I got the impression he thought his dad was being gross. Two very different things would you not agree?", "Because this particular thread involves getting authorities involved and there being real consequences for OP and his family. \n\nI get your point though, and I do think this dad is an asshole", "The man get obvious erections while wearing revealing under wear in common areas. Have any kink you want. When you make others participate you\u2019re an abusive asshole.", "I'm in therapy, thank you", "Genuine question here:\n\nBefore clothes were invented, and even during their invention, when they were not popular, and even in isolated communities today, nudity is incredibly common.\n\nDo you think nudity is inherently traumatising? I would be perfectly fine seeing my grandparents naked, assuming I was raised in a society where nudity wasn't seen as sexual.", "Where are you from that having an erection, while dressed only in tity whitys, in front of your 15 yr old, is ok?", "I\u2019ll believe the truth thanks \ud83d\ude02 nice try", "He said they've argued about it for 4 months, which implies to me that he has asked him to stop repeatedly and the dad has not stopped. That doesn't concern you? That the dad has erections in his tight underwear in front of his kid and the kid has asked for months for him to stop and he hasn't? That feels intentional to me.", "Dad should\u2019ve considered the consequences before doing this weird shit.", "That is good.Wishing you the very best.", "We\u2019re not really talking about things being \u201cokay\u201d which is a very very subjective concept, we\u2019re talking about it being **illegal sexual abuse**", "We\u2019re literally talking about facts right now. You\u2019re telling me that you think a DA truly would bring charges against a man for having an erection while wearing \u201ctight underwear\u201d while in his own home and *in proximity* to his son who also lives there.\n\nSo again, believe what you want, but don\u2019t delude yourself into thinking it\u2019s \u201cthe truth\u201d just because you personally arrived at some arbitrary conclusion.", "My dad used to walk around bollock naked. Granted he stopped as we got a older.", "I mean, I feel like he\u2019s an asshole that thinks he\u2019s entitled to behave the way he is behaving without considering the feelings of others because it\u2019s \u201chis house\u201d or something.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that meets the threshold of it being sexual behavior in nature or warrants getting legal authorities involved, which again is my only real point here.", "Thank you very much", "No one said it was illegal, you added that later bcus you know you\u2019re losing. \n\nA lot of things aren\u2019t legal. In the states it wasn\u2019t illegal to rape your wife until the late 90\u2019s. Legality isnt what defines if something is sexual abuse or not.", "From various legal websites including the DOJ:\n\n\"Sexual conduct is\u00a0criminal\u00a0if it is not consented to, either because the perpetrator uses force or because the victim is not capable of providing consent. Minors under 14 or 15 years of age, depending on the state, are deemed to be incapable of consenting to sexual conduct regardless of their level of maturity.\"\n\n\"sexual abuse includes acts of sexual harassment, rape, indecent exposure, forcing another individual to view or participate in pornography, and contributing in any way to the commercial sexual exploitation of children.\"\n\nYes, I think there would be legal repercussions if this matter was pursued legally. This is an adult exposing himself in a sexual state to a child.", "Go read the top comment of this thread, dummy", "But this is not sexual conduct. That\u2019s my entire point. You guys are the ones saying being in your underwear is sexual"]}
