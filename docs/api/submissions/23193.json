Be prepared that if you hire someone else they may come up with other reasons for you to pay your brother.\n\nTell your brothers that you have made your contribution to parents' welfare.

They also don't care / visit their parents much which he finds absurd, of course.

Tell brother A and your parents that you have purchased the house for your parents, and that you are not putting one more penny into the situation.  IF additional assistance of any kind is required, it is up to your parents to let brother A know and he can fund it.  You have just closed the Bank of Little Sister.

Just keep in mind that just because you paid for the house, doesnt automatically mean that makes them responsible for anything (that was a big one for me to learn). It would be nice & feel a little bit towards fair but they hadnt agreed to that. I would pay a stranger b4 i paid my sibling to do something for my parents that they should be willing to do.

Instead of seeing this as a nice thing to do for his parents who were there for him he sees it as a way to get paid. His parents are in a tight spot.

My spidy senses went off.... I'm not a dependant what could they possibly need my sin number for so I asked why. Instead of answering why she says nm he found it. They were 100% going to use it without my permission. I Obviously said no at that point, delete any information of mine he has stored permanently. If I find out it was used the first call I make will be to CPA to have your license revoked. Family will be the first people to F you over because they'll think it's ok... Cuz you know their family.", "Honestly, those are the only type of jobs that I'd ever even consider hiring a handyman for. Most have zero certifications and aren't licensed to do any real construction, electrical or plumbing work. Even if they claim to have years of experience, never hire a handyman for any type of more involved work on your home. There is a decent chance that the work won't be done to code. Without being licensed, the handyman also can't get the proper insurance, which means the homeowner will usually end up having to pay for any damage that occurs to their home and will also be liable if the handyman were to get injured while on their property.\n\nEdited: typo", "In addition to what everyone else is saying, which I completely agree with, I would also make sure that whatever you tell your brothers is in writing.
