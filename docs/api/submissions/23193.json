That's stuff that kids do for their parents. It's one thing if it was specialized, professional tasks: plumbing, electrical, or even setting up complicated computer/tv/audio stuff. I get that he'd likely charge other people for doing those tasks, but charging mom and dad to hang your own family photos is low.

If his behavior becomes too comfortable, I\u2019m wondering if his next step is to move in anyway without you knowing. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure your brother is a good person just looking to make some money while doing actual work.

Let them be responsible for themselves.  Let them live their lives how they\u2019re living it.  As long as your parents are not in harms way, let things go.   Let your brother be humiliated, or take responsibility for them. But you need to step back and set some boundaries. Especially while they can still take care of themselves a little bit. You can explain it to them by telling them that your brothers or not being Allowed to be the caretakers of their family because they\u2019ve come to depend on you to be the boss and they need to step forward and be the boss. It may be uncomfortable for your parents for a year but they need to step forward as the covering for your family/parents.", "NTA.

It would be madness that they live in a house you and husband pay for, only for them to die and it be split between all siblings. The house needs to go to you in the unfortunate event of their deaths. Otherwise your brothers would financially profit off of your kindness.", "NTA, and please protect yourself.\n\nYour brothers are not out for anyone but themselves, and certainly not your parents or to be fair to you. You need to put your parents' house in a trust with you and your husband as the trustees. Your parents are elderly and you cannot leave it to chance that your brothers will not swoop in to fight you over what they have absolutely zero right to.\n\nAlso, you need to cut them off. They sound like nothing but mooches and are bringing nothing but disharmony to your life. Is there anything positive they bring to your life? Truly?\n\nHalf the reason your parents are broke is because of them. If you are financing your parents' lifestyle, you need to set a boundary that the money you provide them *cannot* be used to help out your brothers. If they want help, they have to go to you, not your parents. They will continue to suck you and your parents dry until they die and the gravy train runs out, then they will fight you over the scraps.\n\nHire someone else to help out your parents and pay them a fair wage. You need to cut out the brothers out of your life and that of your parents. Otherwise, your plan to help out your parents will just have you supporting two deadweight brothers forever. It's not going to be easy to set boundaries with your parents, but you need to do it. This sort of situation is untenable.", "*There are a lot of odd jobs that need doing. Curtains need to be put up, frames need to be put on the walls, garden needs to be cleaned etc*.\n\nThis is pretty much everyday stuff.  If your parents are too ill to do these things themselves they may need medical attention, or to be in assisted living.\n\nI think that it is more likely that they are trying to have a reason for you to help support your brother, OP.  Be prepared that if you hire someone else they may come up with other reasons for you to pay your brother.\n\nTell your brothers that you have made your contribution to parents' welfare.  It is now up to each of them to do their part.  Older brother can send some money, and handyman guy can do his thing for his contribution.\n\nYou don't need to do this all yourself, OP.  Let your brother's step up.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You have provided for their actual needs by yourself at significant expense. Tell your parents to ask your brothers for help with the rest. If it is still not done when you next visit you can do it then.", "Absolutely not .. he can\u2019t hang up curtains for his parents? If you have to pay someone hire someone else and tell your brother to kick rocks he\u2019s an AH", "NTA.  God, I hate people like this. He is a fully functioning adult and feels entitled to mooch off everybody else. Good job putting the house in your name, but I am concerned about the spending money you give your parents? \n\nDo they give him money that otherwise would go to groceries.

Just so hard as I don\u2019t want to cause any family issues!", "Yes. He is a professional. I understand where you are coming from, hence my internal struggle.

He lives literally 10 minutes away and I feel like he could do it for free as we are already doing everything else. But I understand what you mean. Thank you.", "Thank you. That\u2019s very valuable feedback. My husband and I had agreed together to give them a monthly stipend to buy food and fuel and pay for electricity etc. But last week most of that money was Once again used to pay for equipment my brother needed to do a job. This money will obviously not be paid back. So I think we will do a food delivery service and prepay the electricity.

Thank you.", "He happily sent me the hourly rate and a full quotation this morning.

It\u2019s such a frustrating situation. Thank you for your help!", "Yes they do. I found this out by accident as the money we had sent was then given to him to buy equipment he needed for a job. So i think prepaying for essentials is the way to go. Thank you for your input I really appreciate it.", "Some of these \u201cjobs\u201d are so basic your parents should be able to do them.

I also wouldn\u2019t rent to him as he would likely not pay because \u201cfamily\u201d.", "I don't think you have to worry about being rude because him *asking* in this situation is rude!\n\nYou can simply say it's not financially feasible for you if you want to avoid the fight but you aren't required to explain *why* you say no. It's allowed to be a complete sentence.\n\nThat said, I really hope your name is the only one on title (perhaps and your parents). Because if it's just in your parents' names, you're at the mercy of them having an accurate and up to date will. Otherwise legally, the property will be split between the three of you...\n\nEdit: just saw you replied to another comment that the house is in you and your husband's names. Good! That's all the leverage you need to say no without any further discussion.\n\nSecond edit: forgot to actually add judgement! NTA", "I'm on board with you OP. The by the hour thing is throwing me a bit. An unrelated professional will come, do the job, leave and bill.

It would be great if he pitched in (for free)", "It is really not fair that your brothers see your parents as a way to take advantage of you, and that your parents cannot set those boundaries themselves. It's a bad situation. I think your idea for prepaying the essentials is a good idea. If they are putting your brothers before their own needs, it's obvious they cannot be trusted to keep the electricity on themselves.\n\nYou sound like a lovely generous person that wants to see their parents have a comfortable life. Just make sure you don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "My mother is. My dad not so much. My mom had a soft spot for him because he\u2019s been dealt a raw deal.

Thank you for being so kind and understanding and super helpful. I think I\u2019m upset that my brothers cannot see the worth of it all. How do you just carry on living your life knowing your parents aren\u2019t safe warm and happy.

My parents would be encouraging the brother to suggest to us the house be gifted to brother who wants the house. Just make sure you are surprised by that situation.", "We don\u2019t but they won\u2019t know that. I think just a No should be the actual answer. Why should I have to explain why THEY cannot live in a house WE paid for. Makes no sense to me. Thank you for your help.", "My god I can actually see this happening."]}
