Be prepared that if you hire someone else they may come up with other reasons for you to pay your brother.\n\nTell your brothers that you have made your contribution to parents' welfare.

They also don't care / visit their parents much which he finds absurd, of course.

I was able to get my bill sometimes in the negative through that in california. they can also apply for SNAP since they are very low income (make sure to check the full list of things you can do as deductions to get the max), and they can get free cell phones and service as well (or landline if they still roll that way). meals on wheels will also deliver food daily for free and report any bad conditions they may hide from you. there are many, many programs down to the local level for low income seniors that just aren't advertised. it can be a job to apply for that in itself, but hopefully it would take a burden off of you and lower the amount you have to pay for their care. I'm currently homeless and have always been disabled, and I had to take care of my mom for YEARS and she'd do a ton of the same stuff your parents do. it drove me up the wall, because she sabotages every single thing I get done for her, then gets mad at me for helping her with stuff she asked for my help with. all while I'm basically bedbound and struggling myself! I haven't talked to her in awhile because of that and other drama. I know how hard it can be! but make sure you are maximising any programs you can get for them, especially because they have no assets. you won't be able to prevent them from giving stuff away completely, but at least you'll be the one paying less of it so it'll be easier to cover any gaps.", "Exactly as you say there needs to be some actions put into place to ensure that you are not paying for his life but your parents get what they need.

To cover them being able to live a little have a think about anything that you know they like doing, a certain place they like to lunch or event they like to go to and look at buying them a monthly gift card or contacting the place and requesting that when your parents come in for dinner etc they bill you (your parents would know before the go I assume). This means they can still get out and about but tell them that if they need anything specific or want to do anything specific that you are happy to order it for them and have it delivered or contact the place they want to go and pay them direct. I had to do this for my father for a while as he could not be trusted with cash basically. Since it seems you have already mentioned this to them make sure they know the reason why, because this way they can\u2019t give it to your brother. Then they won\u2019t think it is because you can\u2019t afford for them to do anything but will see that they have no way to give him cash. It may seem a bit demeaning (I don\u2019t think it is but could come across that way!) but you could also get them a prepaid card, like the ones used to teach younger people responsibility with money, which is linked to your account so you get a notification each time they use it showing where, when and how much.\nOnce your brother realised that you have things under lock and key he will be forced to go and start getting his own life together.

Tell him that his time is better used on decent paying jobs rather than these little things. The fact that he wouldn\u2019t go round and do work on his parents house for free is mind boggling. My best friend works in IT and he gives my parents loads of help as they are terrible with computers, not even his own parents and he wouldn\u2019t ever consider taking anything for it!\nGo with the other suggestions and tell your brother that the money was taken from your pension funds which came with a penalty so you already have that to contend with but it must be paid back once your parents no longer need the house. Never let them move in. Visit and get some neighbours on side so you have information! None of this is spiteful to your brother, it is simply protecting your investment and making sure you get what is rightfully yours returned one day. It was your parents choice to give up all their money but they do not have the right to give away yours and you need to tell them exactly that, firmly. It would be disrespectful to you and your family and the sacrifices you are all making for them.\nYou are definitely NTA.", "That is so valuable and informative thank you so much!", "Thank you so much for that\u2764\ufe0f", "If your parents ask this, feign surprise and ask how they intend to pay you for the house", "NTA\n\nTell your mother you cannot afford more than what you are giving. So if they cant find someone to help put up a frame for free tey can live without it.\n\nTell your other brother who pulled out that since the burden all went on you he can take over the burden of your other brother or the burden of doing odd jobs and making sure the house is livable.\n\nBe firm. Worse case see if someone can find you a cheap handy man who can do it all very quickly and cheaply", "NTA. If you want to pay for someone to do it, ask a local Facebook page for recommendations for someone who does that kind of thing for a reasonable rate and engage them instead for the necessary bits (like curtains). If your mum and dad want pictures up, command strips are their friend. Further finishing touches are what makes a house a home and are best done by the people living there to give them an emotional link to the house. If they want to use the allowance you and your husband very generously provide make it clear ahead of time this will not be topped up if they overspend on things like getting your brother out. You have done your part for supporting them in a massive way - if your brother doesn't want to help out just because it is something he can do (since not everyone can buy a house if it were me I would want to help in my own way, not cash in) then that is for him and your parents to discuss. Would also approach legal advice as to protect yourself from him attempting to get anything back from the house in the future because he \"worked on it\" as if he can extort you for making his mum and dad comfortable he could certainly push it later on too.", "That brother has 3 kids right? If he needs help, he better hope at least one of the three steps up the way you did. \n\nBut yeah, tell him you've raided your own retirement funds to provide for *your parents*. You will need to sell that house to pay yourself back. Your parents might need a higher level of care in a few years, and you might need to sell the house to finance it. He should not be planning his future in a house that you own. Best to make that very clear now.", "Thank you for the support. It means so much and really makes me see things in a clear light", "NTA. Simply tell your brother you don't have the money or simply that you've spent enough. Tell your brother to try contacting the other brother for payment. Odds are the tasks will get done eventually if you step back from it and going forward you won't be expected to pay. Also make sure you are joint owner with right of survivorship on the deed so house goes right back to you after your parents are deceased.", "This is my thought on the matter. OP mentioned they feel like the gravy train.  I\u2019m assuming the parents wouldn\u2019t rat out son as far as dogging these jobs and driving up hourly rate.  Where as a professional would get in there and get it all done in one go.  I\u2019m not sure how it works for handymen since I\u2019m in a skilled trade but could you easily pass it off as needing to get someone who is bonded in case they mess up one of the projects and you need it to be legit for home owners insurance reasons?", "Absolutely he will, I'd pay a handy man, that doesn't charge by the hour, and you just pay for what they quote to fit/repair etc as that brother is gonna milk the hour by hour   \nNTA OP", "NTA.  If brother really wants to get this granular about the finances and contributions, remind him that he failed to contribute to your parents\u2019 home. When his total labor hours have exceeded 1/3 of the cost of the home, then you can start discussing actual payments.", "I am so glad you answered and the house is in your and your husband\u2019s name. I can finally leave this thread without continuing to worry about you two. NTA"]}
