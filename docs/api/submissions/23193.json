They also don't care / visit their parents much which he finds absurd, of course.

He definitely wants your money!", "INFO - Are you expecting him to do this work?", "Handy man brother shouldn't be charging. These are his parents too. If the parents want to pay for his services, it will have to come from the other sibling who backed out last minute or from their allowance. \nHave a family meeting and make it clear the sacrifices/costs that you have already made. Draw the line at where your assistance begins and ends, then stick to it.", "NTA, but you have done enough for your parents. They threw away their retirement to throw pity at B45 that went no-where. No you are de-facto taking that place by throwing money at B45 through helping your parents. Stop, if they want shit done they can do it themselves or ask B50 to foot the bill.", "Exactly. OP, you can't force your brothers to contribute or be decent people, but you can sure as heck stop paying one of them for being an AH. I know you're far away, but since it's your hometown I hope you have some connections you can use to find someone local who's capable of doing these pretty basic tasks. Like, this could be a neighbor's teenager who wants to earn some cash over the summer, those aren't specialized tasks.\n\nNTA of course.", "Agreed he shouldnt be charging i help my mum out all the time she jokes at least one of her sons are handy fyi im female\ud83e\udd23", "100% this. Definitely NTA but I also wonder: what is the plan for ongoing maintenance? Mom and dad are older in years and OP/spouse are in another country but own this home. It can't fall into disrepair or else OP's investment and even financial security is at risk\n\nINFO: what is the plan for home maintenance? Who is paying for it and is there a budget? What skin do your parents have in the game / are able to contribute to the home (not necessarily money)?", "You\u2019ve got me in tears. Thank you. Really.", "Thank you for saying that. Really. I don\u2019t even see it as Kindness but rather what all kids SHOULD do if in the position and for great deserving parents. Thank you for your input. You are so right. They are not urgent!! Why am I stressing over this!", "Thank you so much. I think I need to put a hard and fast boundary in place and that\u2019s that. Thank you so much for you input it really makes me think and I appreciate it!!", "Thank you! Yes the house is in mine and my husbands names. Thank you!!", "No. They still live in a rented house 10 min away from my parents. This house could possibly have enough space for their family to move in BUT my husband would lose it if that happened and I would for sure not condone nor agree with it. My parents are super grateful and I think embarrassed by it all so doubt they would let him live with them. Well I\u2019m hoping so. Thank you!!", "That\u2019s actually so true. Thank you. No one HAS to. Thank you.", "Omg I am so sorry to hear about you and your bf\u2019s situation it sounds so hurtful and exhausting!! \nThank you for sharing that. I\u2019m sorry that you have to go through it with him but also amazing that you are there  to support him. \n\nThank you for your input. I love the fact that you say \u2018because it is important\u2019. It really is important to me and I now see where I am going wrong and how to navigate this situation better. Thank you a million times over!", "SIL is same. When we moved out of the country we put our truck up for sale. They were so cross as they expected us to give it to them instead of selling it. She then offered to pay us off what ever they could afford monthly. We obviously politely declined. \nBut you are right about them thinking we are sooo rich and expecting money for free basically. I fell bad for them but I also understand now that a line needs to be drawn. Thank you for your help x", "Thank you for your input I appreciate it. I\u2019m upset with him but I honestly think he feels like after his accident the world owes him something. Charity always seems to find them and it\u2019s either excellent karma or amazing luck I don\u2019t know. But I cannot support everyone as that will not be fair on my husband or my kids. Thank you so much again.", "I sincerely hope not. Not really sure how it will be calculated to be honest.", "Thank you!!", "Thank you x", "OMG yes!!! Why have I not thought of this. Genius thank you!!!", "Yeah I get that. Hence my inner turmoil. Thank you so much!", "Thank you for your input. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the popular opinion or not. I appreciate your feedback. Hence me asking the question as I do have inner turmoil re this whole situation. We can afford the house yes. But I cannot afford to support a million things as I too have children who attend school and a life to run. We\u2019ve cut back substantially to be able to afford this which leaves us with no wiggle room. I am converting back to full time work instead of half day to ensure we have enough to save for retirement. But this is complaining with bread in both hands I get it.", "Thank you! I hear you!", "Thank you. My dad is super strict and has always been with the boys. He isn\u2019t the spoon feeding type and I think my brothers secretly resent him for it. My mum is kind and giving but incredibly manipulative and convincing. She has a soft spot for handy man brother and feels bad for him. \nFar away brother said he could no longer afford it as he is buying a new house himself and needs the money for his own house. I totally get that however I was annoyed that he committed to us, and backed out last minute BUT I don\u2019t expect anything from him as he is looking after his own family and I respect that completely.", "Omg another thing I never even though off. Thank you for your insights and help!!", "Thank you for this. I appreciate it and definitely agree that boundaries need to be set Like yesterday.", "Thank you!!!", "Thank you!!!", "In all honesty yes. From my point of view, it\u2019s the least he could do. BUT as has been pointed out no one HAS to do anything and it\u2019s also not my place to expect this or anything of him. It\u2019s not something urgent like a broken pipe or heating issues. But it\u2019s more about my confusion about this whole situation. Thank you for your question.", "Thank you. Yes. Solid advice and guidance thank you!", "Thank you!!!", "IF (big if) you want to help your parents you can hire a company that does this stuff, that is insured in case of accident etc.", "I hope the house is under your name!  Or ask your parents to sign a contract to repay it if they sell", "just remember you\u2019re not the cause behind any issues here, he is.", "If you\u2019re in the U.S., try Meals on Wheels.  Not only they deliver food, but they make a point to connect with the elderly.", "NTA  You owe him nothing!", "MAYDAY MAYDAY! We have seen countless painful stories where the aging parents give everything to one dysfunctional (but physically capable) adult child. This could end so badly for you, OP, and could jeopardize your own financial security. Please be careful and have a backup plan in case the 'prepaying for essentials' also blows up....even if that backup plan is setting very firm boundaries and not paying for anything else for your parents, beyond the immense amount you have already.", "In this case I would hire a local handyman to go over one day to hang all the curtain rods and frames for her.  Tell your mom it is not your job to support brother and that you are appalled that he won\u2019t help his own parents without being paid.", "Thanks - I mean fortunately it is very common overall among his community (Africans living in Canada or the US) so he does not feel entirely personally slighted the way I would! It is pretty shocking though that ppl he hasn't seen in years will get in touch with their hand out, though - not family just ppl he knew. He is happy to help though I think he should put more strings (pay for education or starting a small business, not JUST straight up handouts). \n\nI hope you have gained some clarity w the feedback on here. I mean it is certainly a norm in some cultures but it's also very kind that you are taking it on by yourself even though your brother backed out.", "Or a 10 hour flight, visit the parents and fix the place up yourselves! That seems like a Win-win honestly", "Would you be willing to do your job for free if he demanded it of you?", "Glad you saw this, you sound like a great daughter but you need to care for you too.", "Thank you!! I appreciate your idea!!", "This is what I came here to say. Otherwise OP is going to find one day her parents willing the house to the brother or letting him live there instead.", "Thank you!!!", "Thank you such a good idea!!", "Thank you!!!", "Thank you. It\u2019s so crazy to see the bad side this could all fall into. I really needed this whole thread. Thank you so much for your input.", "Thank you!! I have told her this. He can do no wrong in her eyes as he struggles financially so deserves to have even if she goes without if that makes sense. I think I just need to step away and let things be. It is also not my place to worry about their picture frames. Thank you so much for your input I appreciate it!", "Paying for education?! That\u2019s so crazy I feel like we live in such a sheltered world!!! I would also feel a bit like what!! Thank you. I\u2019ve definitely gained some valuable advice and insights. X", "I\u2019m thinking same!!!!", "Yes, as he is my brother. I offer free medical care for his daughter.", "Thank you for being so caring x", "Agreed: the house is for mom and dad. Once they pass you will sell the house. In the meantime you cannot hire brother because you are already stretched thin in buying the property.", "You're very welcome! All I can say is that when someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "Sorry, that sucks so bad.... Some people just see a way for them to profit (financially or other wise) and can't see reason. Like I bought a whole house for x amount..... When you do that much in repairs, I'll pay you!", "Then NTA. Seems like he's just selfish, then.", "So true. Thank you!!!", "Urgh. Gut punch right?", "My god YES how True!!!! Thank you!!!!!", "I agree.\n\nNo should be a sufficient answer.\n\nIt sometimes makes things easier if there's an actual answer that makes it look like an impossible answer.", "Hated to bring it up but better to be prepared for the worst. My parents would absolutely do this to me.  You might have to be protective and tell parents no way and if they do encourage this behavior parents will need to find other housing options.  My parents would try to leave house to sibling in will . Sorry to be upsetting.", "Yes, that\u2019s my thought too.  I can see your mother promising the house to your brother and his family!  Be prepared to sell it as soon as your parents are gone.  It\u2019s not worth it to rent it out because he\u2019ll keep after you to give it too him especially since he \u201cimproved\u201d it for you.", "Yeah, it was not a good day when I realized some of my family were just selfish people and that was who they had always been and no amount of my disappointment would ever change that. There are support groups out there for people that have to be financial or physical caretakers for aging parents, and a lot of them probably know what you're going through with deadbeat siblings.", "Makes sense. I\u2019m going to remember that!!", "Thank you. Luckily the house is in mine and my husbands names. My husband always stays in the shadows but I foresee a reckoning if this continues.  Thank you so much!", "Thank you. I will take a look at them now. Thank you x 1 million x"]}
