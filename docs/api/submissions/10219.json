However, communication is crucial in my job, and email isn't always an option for many of the complex strategic discussions we have. My wife is unhappy that I am generally unavailable throughout the workday despite being in the next room and that I can't help with household chores or walk the dog during the workday like she can. I remind her that I wouldn't have been able to do those things pre-pandemic since I would have been at the office nearly every day. Furthermore, my wife works in a low-stress, high-paying job with great hours, which I feel is the exception, not the norm.

How lucky for her that she works in a low-stress, high-paying job with flexibility to be able to do things during the day. Not all jobs are like that.\n\nYou are not an AH for working during work hours. As long as you're adequately contributing to the household when you're not working, and you're making time to spend with your wife as best as you can, I see no problem with being unavailable during actual working hours. Your wife needs a reality check.", "NTA\n\nEven if you're working from home you're working. That applies in most jobs so it's not a case of finding something less demanding (unless you go part time or something). If you get to do some bits in a lunch break or have 5 minutes between meetings to stick on a load of washing that's a bonus of working from home, but it can't be expected (certainly no more than a lunch break and not even that will allow time for chores necessarily). As long as you are doing your fair share of household chores outside of work hours she can't complain that you have to work during work hours.", "NTA\n\nYou can't second-guess how someone does their job! She doesn't work there, or know what management values in their employees!\n\nLook, great for her that she's found a \"low stress job with great hours\". But that's not the issue here.\n\nINFO: Do your calls impact her in any way? Do they affect your marriage? Does making these calls means you are neglecting your family?\n\nMy guess is: no\n\nIn which case, she's just expressing her opinion and wants chores-done-on-demand, and you know what they say about the value of unwanted opinions.....", "NTA\n\nWhen you are at work, you are AT WORK. You aren't unavailable 24/7 and just deciding to ignore her, you have a job and you are doing it.", "I'm confused - why does your wife have an opinion about how you do your job? Most people are unavailable during the workday - that's what \"being at work\" entails, even if they are working from home. She has unrealistic expectations, based on the fact that she can take time out from her job whenever she likes. Most people can't do that.\n\nNTA", "NTA - She's unreasonable.   It's a fantasy that people get high pay for little work.   Those who have it should be grateful and understanding that they pretty much it the lotto.   How old is she?  I'm guessing 20ish", "NTA\n\nYour wife isn't your work boss, and she doesn't get to dictate how you do your work while you're at work. Whether you communicate with your colleagues via email or zoom is none of her concern. \n\nYou can and should set some boundaries with her about your availability during your work hours. When you're at work, you're at work. That said, if those work hours are getting very long and seriously infringing on your home life in the evening, then that's a conversation the two of you can have together about whether your current work-life balance is healthy for your relationship.\n\nShe sounds rather overbearing, telling you what to do about your career and how to do your job while you're at work. She needs to respect your right to make these kinds of decisions for yourself. She can have input, especially when it impacts the family finances, but having input is not the same as always having her way.", "NTA. You\u2019re at work, be it from home. Yes she\u2019s lucky to have a less demanding job but she can\u2019t just expect you to change jobs because she thinks you\u2019ve got too many meetings when working from home. That is part of your job, she needs to understand that.", "NTA.  Do you have the option of going in to the office to work?  If so, that might just eliminate the issue.   If not, perhaps finding a coworking location  where you rent space in an office environment might also be an option.  The problem seems to stem from her perception that if you're at home you're not obligated to be fully engaged in your work amd she thinks you should be multitasking with household chores.  Not working from home might solve that.", "NTA. YOU HAVE A JOB during the day. As long as it is not 10-12 hours a fay, you have the normal after work time with her. \n\nPerhaps you should look into finding an inexpensive shoebox office a few minutes away and working from there, not from your home. To make the at home/at work separation clearer.", "NTA-I do think her job is outside the norm. But hopefully you do help outside of work hours.", "NTA. Your wife should really stop micromanaging your career. It can be seriously damaging.", "NTA. It's great that your spouse has a job that affords schedule flexibility during the day, but that's extremely rare these days.\n\nIt's simply not the reality for 99% of people in remote work positions.", "NTA my bf works in tech and he's in meetings all day, because that's his job...he doesn't get time to eat some days let alone extras. She's being unreasonable", "Nta.", "NTA, this was all her idea to begin with.", "NTA - but she still need to know that she is your priority. I think that is the message she is sending and you need to decide if your career or marriage are more important.", "NTA. Having a career/job that occupies your time during regular working hours is completely normal in this day and age. You do owe her equal effort with the dog and with household tasks, but you don't owe it during the hours you're working.\n\nAlso, she's wrong about replacing live conversations with email. As a business owner myself, I can tell you that the value of real-time conversations, even via phone or zoom, far exceeds that of text-based communication (which has it's place, of course).\n\nAs long as you are available after work hours and you aren't putting in tons of overtime, etc, then she should be more understanding.", "NTA - you're still working, and it sounds like your job is demanding. Your wife is pretty much the reason you're here, and it's completely unjustified for her to think that being at home does not entail actual hard work.", "NTA. Your wife needs to understand that her work situation is not the norm. \u201cGo out and find a job that pays a bunch of money where you hardly have to do anything!\u201d is not the token wisdom she thinks it is.", "NTA but I think your wife misses quality time with you. She should not be telling you how to do your job. As long as you\u2019re contributing with household chores when you *do* have time, and this is what you want to do as a career, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH.", "Look I\u2019m gonna say NTA\n\nBUT\u2026 maybe her point is that she wants to spend more quality time together and I feel like you\u2019re not listening. This is gonna be unpopular but! There are ways to have your cake and eat it too, I\u2019ve seen plenty of managers do this despite not having gotten there myself yet. If you don\u2019t feel as passionate about work as you feel about your relationship and are interested in doing less, without knowing details I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible some of the meetings can be emails and you can become more efficient. But that is of course if you are also interested in working less, not just your wife.", "NTA for working during WORK hours.  BUT that doesn't mean you get to skip out on chores or spending time with your wife once the work day is done.\n\nYou might want to examine your meeting schedules.  You know your job - we & your wife do not BUT it could be that some of these meetings are redundant ie send an email then have a meeting vs having 3 meetings?\n\nAlso - it's hard to tell whether your wife is too demanding or you are slightly resentful of her 'great job' or maybe a bit of both.  Either SHE: 'Get a job! .... oh... not THAT job!\" or YOU:  \"Hey you kept pushing me to work so now that's ALL I'll do!'", "YTA you don\u2019t need this job, actually find one with decent work-life balance.

Well don't we all wish we had your wife's job!

Startup culture is not the same as corporate culture in mature, established companies.  \n\nNTA, but I think maybe you need to have a sit down conversation with your wife about the expectations of your role and company.  If you can't come to compromise about what level of work demands you are both okay with, then you may need to seek some outside advice.", "to answer your questions...  \n\n\nOne potential impact is that there's really only one home office space in our house.  We converted part of the guestroom into a makeshift office once the pandemic hit.  I pretty much use it exclusively since I'm on calls most of the day and need privacy and the ability to keep the door shut (especially when the kids are home from school).  She ends up having to do her work from the couch.  I don't think she minds it too much, but sometimes wishes she had a proper workspace.  \n\n\nI do get stressed at work sometimes and it can consume my thoughts occasionally so she gets sick of me talking about work related stuff.  I don't necessarily neglect my family as a result, but I will say I find myself more tired at the end of a work day from being \"on\" most of the day.  I'm more of an introvert by nature, so running meetings and workshops can wear me out.  She, on the other hand, doesn't converse much at her job, so when her workday is over, she's ready to talk...while I'm completely talked-out.

So once I get the kids up, fed and on the school bus, I'd rather stay in my sweats and just get my job done from home instead of getting cleaned up and dressed and drive in.  But maybe I need to just bite the bullet in the mornings so I can have more dedicated time and a cleaner separation between work and home life.", "This\u2b06\ufe0f So many conflicts are less about the issue at hand and more about the unmet need.
