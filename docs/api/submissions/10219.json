You aren't unavailable 24/7 and just deciding to ignore her, you have a job and you are doing it.", "I'm confused - why does your wife have an opinion about how you do your job? Most people are unavailable during the workday - that's what \"being at work\" entails, even if they are working from home. She has unrealistic expectations, based on the fact that she can take time out from her job whenever she likes. Most people can't do that.\n\nNTA", "NTA - She's unreasonable.

If not, perhaps finding a coworking location  where you rent space in an office environment might also be an option.

Not working from home might solve that.", "NTA. YOU HAVE A JOB during the day.

Having a career/job that occupies your time during regular working hours is completely normal in this day and age. You do owe her equal effort with the dog and with household tasks, but you don't owe it during the hours you're working.\n\nAlso, she's wrong about replacing live conversations with email. As a business owner myself, I can tell you that the value of real-time conversations, even via phone or zoom, far exceeds that of text-based communication (which has it's place, of course).\n\nAs long as you are available after work hours and you aren't putting in tons of overtime, etc, then she should be more understanding.", "NTA - you're still working, and it sounds like your job is demanding.

We converted part of the guestroom into a makeshift office once the pandemic hit.  I pretty much use it exclusively since I'm on calls most of the day and need privacy and the ability to keep the door shut (especially when the kids are home from school).

I'm more of an introvert by nature, so running meetings and workshops can wear me out.

She was the clear breadwinner for a while until I made the jump from being an individual contributor to a manager.  Now we make almost identical amounts, the key difference is she works 4 days a week and I work 5.  And her 4 days are extremely low stress and afford her opportunities to do non-work stuff, mine require me to put in at least 8 true hours of work.  So if you were to break down our wages by hour, she's still the breadwinner.  If you break it down by annual salary, it's a tie.  \n\n\n \\- She doesn't handle most of the household chores, our split is roughly 50/50.  Some things she does more of, some things I do more of.  The sticking point is that she wants (or demands) that I do some of these things during working hours.  Once I'm signed off for the day, I pretty much exclusively am taking care of things around the house.  It isn't until the kids are put to bed that I get even a semblance of R&R time, and that's usually in the form of watching an episode of TV with my wife and then heading to bed.", "That\u2019s not fair you\u2019ve taken over the office and she has to work in the living room.", "I know, and I try to address that.  \n\n\nWe both use laptops, and the office is equipped with an external monitor on a desk where either of us can plug our respective laptop in when we need to.  She doesn't often need dual monitors, but I did put together sort of a makeshift workspace in our living room with another monitor when she needs one.  On the rare occasion when she needs a private room for a meeting, I make every effort to accommodate by either shifting my meetings around so she can have the home office, or go into my company's office on that day.  I'm not exaggerating when I say she had 1 meeting every 6 weeks or so, while I have maybe 6 meetings a day on average.  I honestly don't think she minds working in the living room, it has great windows and lot of natural light...I enjoy working there when I am able to.  I think it mostly bothers her that I will be locked in my office for hours on end in meetings.  \n\n\nSince there's physically only one space in our house that can serve as an actual \"office\" I'm not sure what else I can do aside from sell the house?", "> I honestly don't think she minds working in the living room, it has great windows and lot of natural light\n\n\nBut you don\u2019t know for sure? You haven\u2019t talked to her about it? Don\u2019t ask me what to do, I\u2019m just pointing out it\u2019s not fair to her.", "I'll say this, she has never once asked to use it unless she needed to be on a call.  And she's not the personality type to just put up with something she dislikes and not say anything.  We both refer to the guestroom office space as \"the dungeon\" because it's in the basement and gets terrible light.  \n\n\nShe did mention wishing there was a second desk, which is why we put one in the living room, but even then she'll typically just work on the couch because it's comfortable.  When I'm not on calls I'll usually come up to the room and work next to her, and never once has she voluntarily gone down to make use of the office when it was unoccupied in the past 3 years, other than a few meetings.", "I legit am not trying to be disingenuous, it's hard to know what all to edit for brevity.  I was both sincere in my OP and in the additional context as was requested.", "NTA\nIf she has the time to listen to and review your zooms, she has the time to get her ass up and do whatever it is she thinks you should be doing.", "I am in technology also and and work 4 10 hour days. I am not in management but I also have internal meetings as well as meetings with customers because I do support. I am single and I have a dog. Some days are extremely busy. Today was my day off but I worked for about an hour and half because the customer needed support and we are short staffed due to the economy and other staff being out.\n\nTechnology is very difficult and some days are brutal. It does sound like the op is doing a lot at home and not just working. Part of the problem is his wife can\u2019t relate to how demanding his job is and zoom meetings are a must and emails are great to have everything in writing.\n\nCommunication is key and with your wife\u2019s job she can\u2019t relate to your job.\n\nCounseling is a great idea but also since your wife is off Fridays maybe she could sit in and get a better understanding of your job. That may not be realistic but it could be helpful if she understands your job better and why her ask is not possible.", "op=NTA\n\nJobs do not grow on trees.  NOT being accessible during work hours is normal.  Spouses NEED to accept that Work from Home is STILL work and needs to be respected.\n\nConsider making an office outside the home(garage, He-shed, your parents garage if they live nearby.  Do something that puts you outside her access during work hours).", "If she is complaining you have to ask...", "Right? She is telling him she has needs and he knows she is sad, but he feels his needs/career are more important. It sounds like now she is also working full time which her partner considers to be a lower status than his (ouch) \\*and\\* taking care of a lot of the household chores on top of it her partner is not even meeting her emotional needs.   \n\n\nIf she were my friend, I would strongly suggest she not have kids with this guy. I don't know if I woud say YTA, but you definitely will be single unless something changes. Couples counseling is strongly advised here.", "Yes! Counseling is a great idea! \n\nHonestly prob all couples should go now and again.", "> I do believe that some of the stress here lies in the fact that I don't make the same money I used to at the consulting firm...and she feels like my workload did not diminish as much as my pay did. And she's partially right about that.\n\nNo one can get frustrated on your behalf quite like your spouse can! I get mad, probably more mad than I should, whenever I feel like my wife's employer is taking advantage of her. She gets the same way with me. I wonder if your wife feels that way about your situation. \n\nFrom her perspective, you took a pay cut (which means you two as a family took a pay cut) in order for you to spend less time in meetings and be less stressed and *someone* isn't holding up their end of the deal - either that's your employer in which case you don't owe them as much loyalty as you're showing or it's you because you're saying yes to more tasks than you should. Either way, I can understand her frustration.", "Start with how many hours a day you work, how much you help with chores, how small this start up is, how much you dont talk to her and then we will listen to your oh poor me about how delusional she is about her cushy job.", "1.  8.  I start between 830 and 9 and I finish between 430 and 5.\n\n2.  I would say that make breakfast for the kids and get them off to school 70% of the time, and I pick them up from after care about 90%.
