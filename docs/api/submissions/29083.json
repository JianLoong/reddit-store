OP\u2019s husband medically neglected their babies. He clearly didn\u2019t even tell OP that he hadn\u2019t actually been taking them to their therapy because it was a complete surprise to OP when they\u2019d been dropped from the clinic for poor attendance. OP used every means at her disposal to make her husband aware of his own children\u2019s needs. What competent parent needs their spouse to make a fucking multimedia presentation from a hospital bed in order to properly parent their own children?? OP is NTA and the separation should be permanent.", "NTA. This is part of having kids- adapting to them and their abilities. You did a wonderful job by making them go to therapy at such a young age. The younger they are, the easier it is for them to develop properly. Your husband didn\u2019t seem to care so they are now setback developmentally. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with so much on your plate. You have truly done your best for your children. I\u2019m sending hugs <3", "NTA.\n\nI thought separating would be the hardest thing I ever did.  In reality, I had one less child to manage.  Now I can spend more time on my actual children's development.  Life sucks sometimes, but when faced with this kind of choice, you have to choose your children.", "NTA - but your husband is NOT a \u2018good father\u2019.  \nA good father would have made sure his children were properly cared for.  \nI wouldn\u2019t trust him with them.", "Mmm a textbook example of weaponized incompetence. \n\nFact of the matter is, if he were capable of improvement, he would\u2019ve done it already, because otherwise he\u2019d be a deadbeat who knows he can do better by his medically fragile children, but chooses not to. So he\u2019s either that, or just incapable, and either way, not someone you want having responsibility for your kids.", "NTA If you had died, your husband should have lost custody of the kids from medical negligence. You taking the kids is the same consequence. \n\nIt is not enough to simply feed and clothe a kid - everyone knows that if a kid doesn't get hugs, interactions with people, comfort when sick, and so on, kids are severely damaged, and may even die. Remember the pictures of Romanian kids in orphanages from the 80s? Your kids need physical therapy the same way every kid needs hugs. Your husband chose not to give them what they need. The consequences of his choice could - no, would - leave your kids with diminished quality of life. There's no way on Earth you could be TA for not letting your husband harm your children.", "NTA. It would be unfair to the kids and yourself to continue having to deal with such incompetence on a daily basis. Your husband is deadweight. It sounds like you bent over backwards to help him keep a schedule and he couldn\u2019t even manage that. I\u2019m really sorry, OP", "NTA. \n\nWhat were his excuses for being incompetent despite being provided all the information he needs to care for his own children? Is he this incompetent at work or does he work a low stress job with no responsibilities?", "NTA and for the record, your husband is not a \"good father.\" He completely neglected your children's medical needs despote having allnthe resources and information spoonfed to him. That makes his a terrible father. I'd find his behaviour unforgiveable.", "NTA\nWhen everything has to be managed by you and you alone even when you are sick then what is he for", "NTA. It\u2019s the medical neglect of toddlers followed by not even telling OP that said toddlers had been dropped by their practitioners that made read the post twice. No. Just, NO!", "I am confused because if this sentence:\n\n\u201cMy husband is a good father he bonds with them, provides for them but he's incompetent when it comes to their care.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026 which is it? Is he a good father, or is he an idiot who can\u2019t so much as get them to very important appointments on time and is damaging their medical future and future health because he can\u2019t follow basic instructions? Those two things can\u2019t really coexist.", "NTA your husband can't be a good parent if these this negligent of his own kids. You're doing the right thing.", "NTA\nAnd your husband isn't a good father, at best he's a decent 15 year old cousin", "Nta.", "ESH. \n\nYour expectations are not reasonable. You needed outside help for you and your husband during this time. He can't care for three kids, be the provider, care for you, care for the home etc for over a year without facing exhaustion and something having to give and without help. Could he have done better? Perhaps. Maybe. Maybe he did what he could do. \n\nAnd having a \"vision board\" with YOUR expectations is not effectively communicating in a marriage. Sitting down and trying to figure out how you could have both made this work is effectively communicating. Asking your husband if he needs help is effectively communicating. On his part he could have communicated with you that he was unable to keep up the schedule without assistance.", "Yta.... Your husband was trying to keep the household afloat with 3 babies and a story injured wife.  And you're upset he wasn't more than one person.  \n\nYou sound horrible.", "NTA. But he might have ADHD. Not an excuse but could be a reason. Unless he just plain doesn\u2019t care about their therapies or care, then that\u2019s a whole different thing but if he\u2019s truly that forgetful and disorganised it might be an executive function thing, especially if he\u2019s like that in other parts of his life.", "I am somewhat confused. OP did all kinds of things to get her husband to do things but evidently never asked her husband if he would do them or was willing to do them and he didn't volunteer the truth that he was not and would not do them. I do not think for a minute he just forgot. Communication has been awful. In addition he did not take kids to appointments to get professional help and did not cancel the appointments either.\n\nWhat a mess. And to top it off, OP isn't good physically and has moved with kids to another state. \n\nI think a place to start would be therapy for the two adults to see how things went so wrong and how to fix things. It will be best for all of this marriage can be saved and husband start to tell wife what he is thinking and actually doing and not doing.\n\nTry to work things out. Also try to find more help with kids and their therapy. Good luck.", "YTA. Although I am full of sympathy for your situation.  And I am so sorry he screwed up your kids therapy. \n\nI see two issues here.  First I have to tell you that if I created a vision board for my husband and put reminders and alarms on his phone, and I did this at a time when he already felt stressed and was also picking up other responsibilities he might not normally handle, he would have torn up the vision board and hurled his phone out the window.  What seems like practical time management and scheduling techniques to me, just make him feel inadequate so he ignores them. But he does have ways of remembering schedules and uses the system that works for him.\n\nI know that you were probably feeling physically and mentally awful when you got ill. And there likely wasn\u2019t time to sit down and talk about everything he would need to assume.  And he probably didn\u2019t have a chance to think thru it himself, tell you honestly what he realistically thought he could actually do and work out a plan together so he could keep up with his schedule using a system that works for him, not the system that works for you.  Hopefully if you have another life event like this you will be able to do so.\n\nThe second thing is simple.  Do you love him?  When you aren\u2019t in crisis mode is he a good dad?  Does he genuinely love you and your kids?  If the answers are \u201cyes\u201d then get back together, get in therapy together work on communication skills and learn how to identify and appreciate eAch others strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIf you no longer love him, if you believe he genuinely doesn\u2019t love your kids and is incapable of caring for them then make the separation permanent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Medical neglect is a form child abuse. This \"father\" care so little about his children that he can't be bothered to bring them to therapy appointment after having a board on the wall and alarms on his cellphones.\nOf is clearly NTA.", "Yup, my daughter has regular PT sessions as treatment for her talipes. Not in the same league as OP anymore but the first year of her life they were very regular (up to once a week the first few months). My husband took all the half days he could to come with us so that he understood what was happening and why, does her appointments when I can't which happened a few times when I was pregnant with our second child and this summer took his PTO to help with her because she had to spend most of it in casting to prevent a full relapse. He keeps track of when she's due to be seen again, passes on any questions that might have cropped up and does her stretches and exercises with her every other day (we alternate). And that shouldn't be remarkable! It's the minimum you should expect from the parent of a child who needs a fee extra steps during the day to be as healthy as they can be!
