They told me baby was totally fine and then the doctor stepped out and I thought it was odd but maybe he'll be right back and go over my treatment or further tests and what have you but then the nurse came in and told me I can go and I was like what?? But I'm still in immense pain and am struggling to walk!  The nurse just looked at me funny then says yeah.. But the baby's ok. And I went but I cry when I walk it's so painful! And she says, I dunno.. try Tylenol I guess? \n\nFound out later that I had numerous fractures where the pain was. My bones were literally breaking from the pregnancy and I basically just got an eye roll. Nobody was concerned about anything but my baby.", "Don't give them the time of day", "Now you are just being unsuferable. If she had difficulties getting pregnant before the first she probably thought it would continue to be difficult.", "Nowhere in this post does anyone talk about having trouble getting pregnant.

The only one trying to get pregnant is the sister.\n\nEdit: also unsufferable is not a word. You\u2019re attempting to call me insufferable.", "You don't know that. She says in the post the first pregnancy was a miracle, so she thought the doctor was right. He also had said that for yearn Also people have sex without trying to get pregnant and there is always a chance it will happen. The idea someone would have a whole human being to be petty over delusional little sister who has main character syndrome is bizarre."]}
