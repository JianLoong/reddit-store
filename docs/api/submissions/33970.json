Does she believe she holds something over your heads, like an inheritance?  Because I would frankly tell her to f\\*ck right the hell off and go NC.  If she wants to be a bitter, old woman, that's her choice.  BTW, I love both names Gracie and Belle!", "I don't even have to attempt to explain why you are NTA,", "NTA. Your grandma sounds insufferable and downright rude. You didn\u2019t say anything to her that wasn\u2019t true\u2026", "NTA.\n\nYour grandmother is incorrigible and insufferable.", "Your grandmother must had \u00e0 easy life if her only problem is the nickname of her daughter... damn so much energy to lose on this\n\nShe is completly crazy NTA", "The thing is this wasn't started by mom renaming herself. It started because mom went by a nickname that comes from the name my grandmother gave her. My grandmother pushed the issue so much that mom did eventually rename herself but in reality it's still super close to her original name.", "I don't know. But honestly my mom never expected to get anything from her since the name change. She knew her mother would forever hold it against her.", "I would also consider her a bit of a bully. Especially when you look at how she treated my mom's friends when they were kids.", "NTA. I am so glad I never had grandparents growing up on either side of the family. I have read horror stories about them and your sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA, and good for you to point out a fact. Why are you still in contact with her? She sounds insufferable\u2026", "I wouldn\u2019t tell my grandmother to shut the fuck up. However her weird attachment to the importance of what are the personal choices of others leads me to believe she has some loose screws. NTA.", "NTA- you only need to be respectful to people who come with kindness and respectful good intentions. Your grandmother has never shown that to your mother, and by extension, you.", "NTA why did she come to your home just to pick a fight? If she's always like this, don't invite her in. Tell your mum it might be better for you both just to greet her at the door and send her on her way. Or not even answer the door at all.\n\nIt was one thing her coming at you, another when she pulled your mum in and insulted someone you love and respect to your face. You weren't wrong in your response, but if you feel bad about it - either the swearing or the rage you felt, discuss it with your mum, get it off your chest and work on keeping a measured response the next time. Sometimes, just standing up without a word and walking away can hit even harder.", "NTA Grandma needed to be put in her place.", "NTA. Old unhinged people don\u2019t get a permit to act unhinged just because they\u2019re old. Respect is earned, not deserved. She needed to STFU.", "NTA\n\nGrandma needs a reality check", "NTA she doesnt get to control other people like that.", "NTA.  She really shouldn\u2019t be demanding respect while being disrespectful.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nWhat your grandmother said to your grandfather...how mean she was to your mom & now she's started in on you...\n\nThis is one malign & malevolent individual. She got what she earned & it sure wasn't respect.\n\nGood for you telling her how it is & your mom for kicking her out.", "NTA. Sometimes, Well what the heck. People like her need rude awakenings on a regular basis. Its a necessity for them.", "NTA. Being old does not mean say whatever you want.", "NTA. If you ever speak to her again, definitely pick a variant of her name, and call her that exclusively instead of her given name.", "GM created a huge issue out of nothing. FIFY.", "I love every part of this comment", "I am sure she has a place waiting for her.  A hot one."]}
