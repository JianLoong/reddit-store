I didn\u2019t have time to eat at home because I always do a morning workout before starting my day and I figured no problem, I\u2019ll eat at the office.\n\nDuring the training, I ate my bananas and peanut butter. I had a tupperware of peanut butter and a couple bananas. I didn\u2019t have any napkins or silverware so I was biting off pieces of banana and dipping them in the PB.\n\nI was also actively engaged with the training presentation and taking notes on my computer.\n\nA few of my coworkers were giving me looks, and no one else was eating. I was being very quiet and not crunching or disturbing anything, or making a mess so I thought it would be fine if I was eating.\n\nAt one point, the guy next to me was staring at my bananas, so I offered him one. He shook his head and shushed me but nothing else really happened.\n\nThe presentation and training went fine, I participated and asked some questions, but later at lunch, I heard my one coworker who I had offered the banana to complaining that the whole meeting room smelled like bananas and PB.\n\nI interjected and told him to stop complaining since I HAD offered to share and was not interrupting the training or being a nuisance.\n\nIt ended up being a split debate\u2026 A few of my coworkers agreed with the guy and said I shouldn\u2019t have been eating during the training but one or two people agreed with me and said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, I wasn\u2019t disturbing anyone.\n\nI have another training office day next month so I want to ask.. Was I the AH for eating? Should I not eat anything next time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It is a very healthy breakfast. I work out a lot so I usually eat 2-4 bananas and 3-5 tbsp of PB because I need the protein and electrolytes and I dont like artificial protein shakes. The amount of PB depends on how many calories I burnt during working out.\n\nUsually for lunch I have eggs and then I do an apple and PB for snack later.\n\nWould an apple be better to eat at work than a banana since it\u2019s less smelly?", "created_utc": 1674672544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l68v6/aita_for_eating_during_work/", "score": 199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes YTA. And were in fact distracting others. It sounds incredibly unprofessional. Eat at home, eat in the car, eat before or after your training. This isn't your home.", "Light YTA here.  Eating at your desk is one thing, but eating during an actual meeting is generally a no-no unless food was provided or it was specifically scheduled as a mealtime brownbag session.", "YTA\n\nSimply because you admitted you had time to eat before going into work, but chose to workout instead. Just prioritise your time better and perhaps just wake up earlier to have breakfast when you do have work meetings.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you were the only person eating should have clued you in. \n\nNext time, wake up earlier and eat at home.

Eating banana and peanut butter during an in house work place training session isn't appropriate.", "YTA. Not everyone likes the smell of bananas and PB. It was a training so everyone probably had to be there, so no escape from the smell of your food. You offering some to him was obviously not what he wanted, so you using that as a reason for him to stop complaining is not valid. Making others uncomfortable in a situation that they have little to no control over makes you an AH. Next time eat before training.", "Ahh...YTA.\n\nEating during a group meeting in-person in a conference room is typically not done unless the meeting is scheduled over lunch, forcing people to skip a normal feeding time. Then everybody is in the same boat together, so sharing the potentially unwanted odors of each others' food. \n\nI once was once interviewing a candidate in person, and during our interview the candidate brought out some food and started eating it in front of me without mentioning it.

However, both the person sitting directly next to you and, as you mentioned, several others were both distracted and annoyed by your actions.\n\n>I wasn't disturbing anyone\n\nOnce again, obviously false as the whole reason this was brought up for discussion amongst the office was that it WAS disturbing people.\n\nWorking at home is great, I do it every day, and it gives us all a great level of freedom to not really care what others think of what we do and how we look. However, when you go into a shared work environment, it is important to be cognizant of the needs of others. \n\nYou could have either cut short your workout (or woken up a little earlier) and eaten before leaving, or eaten on the way/before the meeting. You had other options. Those in the meeting didn't. They had to sit near you whether you were eating or not.", "YTA, not in a truly bad way but more oblivious I guess. It\u2019s kind of rude and distracting to eat in front of people who are trying to work, and bananas and peanut butter tend to be a bit smelly. \n\nIn the future read the room. If no one else is eating and people are giving you looks that\u2019s a good sign to save the snacks until break time.", "YTA. So you had banana peanut butter fingers, were taking your banana bites back out of your mouth, and were also taking notes on your computer? That would be distractingly disgusting to me if I was sitting next to you. It can be OK to eat in meetings (if you are hungry you can't focus as well), but it depends a lot on the food and the context. This was a job for a protein bar, cheese stick, or bag of grapes. You need to eat the banana PB combo in private. Like, always.", "YTA\n\nUnless the meeting specifically has food provided or is a brown bag training type thing, you don't eat during a meeting.

It's not appropriate.  \n\nI don't think it's like, career ending, but in the future eat before or after any trainings.", "Soft YTA, mostly because it sounds like you took your time to eat several bananas, over the course of all the training. Having a snack is one thing, but this seemed like a production. Also, smelly/noisy foods are a no go and bananas and pb have strong smells.

However it's definitely a \"read the room\" (and the rulebook) kind of things. Training and meetings are generally regarded as a bit more high priority than your general day to day grind, so it's expected that everyone pay their undivided attention.

It is disrespectful to be having even just a snack with a team on training as it can be distracting. It's not a movie marathon or a picnic, nor a casual  hangout. Training is work related, hence it is expected not to do any personal stuff while it's ongoing. Unless of course it is your company's culture to be doing so. If it really couldn't be helped, you could've at least asked, thought about how it could negatively impact others.", "YTA Eating in a meeting or training full of people is rude. And not because you are not sharing. I am mentioning this because you seem to think that the guy was annoyed because you didn't share.

Since you rarely have to go in person on the days you do wake up 10 minutes early, shift your workout back and eat before the meeting. YTA.", "YTA\n\nGood rule of thumb is to only eat in meetings if food is provided. Sounds like you need to adjust your time and eat before your meetings. \n\nThe fact your we\u2019re biting pieces of banana off and dipping it sounds and probably looks disgusting.", "YTA. Just your description of biting off a chunk of banana, removing that chunk from your mouth, dipping it into peanut butter, then putting it back into your mouth... Super not okay during a professional training session.\n\nNext month, make yourself a smoothie with bananas, yogurt, and peanut butter and drink it on the way in, or while sitting in your training. But don't do *this* again.", "YTA. \n1. Once food enters your mouth, it does not exit it again in front of other people. Dude. Seriously? \n\n2. Don\u2019t eat in front of people who aren\u2019t eating during a non-eating activity. Eating is noisy, you don\u2019t sound especially like someone who chews with their mouth closed, and seeing masticated food is nauseating for most. It\u2019s distracting. You were in a work meeting!\n\n3. Don\u2019t eat smelly food in front of a captive audience. Peanut butter and bananas are both highly fragrant foods, bananas less so but still. \n\n4. Did you ask if anyone had a nut allergy? That\u2019s a risky game to play when you\u2019re on boarding at a company. Yikes. \n\nEat in your car before you enter work if you enjoy eating that way (taking bites of banana out of your mouth and then dipping them in peanut butter). OR eat at your desk with a utensil like a non-feral human.\n\nEdit to add: omg dude you didn\u2019t even have NAPKINS and you were then touching your computer? Pumpkin, that is so unhygienic and I really don\u2019t think you realize but VERY off putting and that level of lack of table manners will absolutely impact your career trajectory. I would highly recommend watching a few videos on general table manners so that you\u2019re not caught unawares again - you will feel more confident in eating situations and not wonder why people are looking at you strangely. \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA. \"I wasn't bothering anyone\".

How distracting.\n\nYou should be fully focused on your job.\n\nIf you aren't capable of feeding yourself before work, you aren't grown enough to have a job.\n\nOthers are having to follow the rules and it's annoying to reminded that you don't bother.", "I feel like this is an office culture thing, which can be hard to gauge when you work from home. I've worked in offices where eating during a meeting is fine and offices where is not fine. NAH, but I probably wouldn't eat in the meeting again.", "YTA - but I think without meaning to. It suggests that you're not fully engaging with the training, you're multitasking it with your own thing, which shows a lack of respect for the other participants and the trainers.\n\nIt's also a bit messy - you're touching foodstuffs and then touching equipment, potentially leaving residue on the equipment, and it also left a smell. Not everyone likes the smell of bananas, it's one of those scents that can linger for quite a while, so other people are then having to put up with that smell in what I imagine is a shared space environment. Your workplace probably has designate eating areas like a kitchenette or a break room and certain allotted times through the day where you can have a bite to eat and refuel. Instead of waiting for those times you went \"my schedule is more important than everyone else's\" which is a bit rude and disrespectful. \n\nAnd also your time management isn't great - like you I like to do an early morning workout before I get ready for work, but if I know there's something that's going to put a hamper on my time I make adjustments - for example if my partner has to leave early for their job and is likely to be needing to get in the bathroom at the time I'm usually in there, I will get up ten minutes earlier so I complete my workout and be out of the bathroom before they need to get in, or I will do a briefer workout if I don't fancy getting up. These are all considerations that need to be factored in. Hard as it might seem when you have a routine, your physical fitness is not going to derail completely if you do a slightly shorter workout or amend your timing a bit to achieve all your goals of a morning.\n\nSo apologies, because I can sympathise with you to a degree, but you're getting the YTA vote from me", "Yta, it's one thing to eat at your own desk or office but in a meeting or conference environment its quite rude to do so.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA. This really depends on the culture of the place, but I also know people who are highly sensitive to the smell of bananas. I\u2019m sure this would be made worse by being trapped in a meeting room for a training session rather than a more open office environment where someone who was bothered might be able to move away from you until you were done. \n\nI also bristled at the peanut butter. If someone has a severe allergy, even being in the same room with it can cause reaction. It\u2019s not cool to bring that into a required meeting without making sure there are no issues first. \n\nMaybe there is an alternative snack you could bring next time that\u2019s not as messy/smelly/potentially life-threatening?", "YTA - I guess.\n\nI don't know that it was asshole behavior, but it for sure was *unprofessional* behavior.\n\nIf you walk into a meeting and there is food and drink on a table for people to take and snack on, then it's expected that people will be eating those during the meeting or training.\n\nOtherwise?  This is work, not breakfast time.  No, you don't bring a meal to eat.", "I\u2019m going to be the lone NTA here, and I\u2019m basing this on my company culture. I work remotely but sometimes go into the office. We all eat during meetings, in person and on camera. It\u2019s not weird. We\u2019re humans with busy lives and sometimes work is so demanding I\u2019d have to choose EITHER lunch or a meeting, so I just do both. \n\nA banana and PB is fragrant but generally not a gross smell.
