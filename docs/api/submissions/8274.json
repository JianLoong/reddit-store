I didn\u2019t have time to eat at home because I always do a morning workout before starting my day and I figured no problem, I\u2019ll eat at the office.\n\nDuring the training, I ate my bananas and peanut butter. I had a tupperware of peanut butter and a couple bananas. I didn\u2019t have any napkins or silverware so I was biting off pieces of banana and dipping them in the PB.\n\nI was also actively engaged with the training presentation and taking notes on my computer.\n\nA few of my coworkers were giving me looks, and no one else was eating. I was being very quiet and not crunching or disturbing anything, or making a mess so I thought it would be fine if I was eating.\n\nAt one point, the guy next to me was staring at my bananas, so I offered him one. He shook his head and shushed me but nothing else really happened.\n\nThe presentation and training went fine, I participated and asked some questions, but later at lunch, I heard my one coworker who I had offered the banana to complaining that the whole meeting room smelled like bananas and PB.\n\nI interjected and told him to stop complaining since I HAD offered to share and was not interrupting the training or being a nuisance.\n\nIt ended up being a split debate\u2026 A few of my coworkers agreed with the guy and said I shouldn\u2019t have been eating during the training but one or two people agreed with me and said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, I wasn\u2019t disturbing anyone.\n\nI have another training office day next month so I want to ask.. Was I the AH for eating? Should I not eat anything next time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It is a very healthy breakfast. I work out a lot so I usually eat 2-4 bananas and 3-5 tbsp of PB because I need the protein and electrolytes and I dont like artificial protein shakes. The amount of PB depends on how many calories I burnt during working out.\n\nUsually for lunch I have eggs and then I do an apple and PB for snack later.\n\nWould an apple be better to eat at work than a banana since it\u2019s less smelly?", "created_utc": 1674672544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l68v6/aita_for_eating_during_work/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Eating at your desk is one thing, but eating during an actual meeting is generally a no-no unless food was provided or it was specifically scheduled as a mealtime brownbag session.", "YTA\n\nSimply because you admitted you had time to eat before going into work, but chose to workout instead. Just prioritise your time better and perhaps just wake up earlier to have breakfast when you do have work meetings.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you were the only person eating should have clued you in. \n\nNext time, wake up earlier and eat at home.

Eating banana and peanut butter during an in house work place training session isn't appropriate.", "YTA. Not everyone likes the smell of bananas and PB. It was a training so everyone probably had to be there, so no escape from the smell of your food. You offering some to him was obviously not what he wanted, so you using that as a reason for him to stop complaining is not valid. Making others uncomfortable in a situation that they have little to no control over makes you an AH. Next time eat before training.", "Ahh...YTA.\n\nEating during a group meeting in-person in a conference room is typically not done unless the meeting is scheduled over lunch, forcing people to skip a normal feeding time. Then everybody is in the same boat together, so sharing the potentially unwanted odors of each others' food. \n\nI once was once interviewing a candidate in person, and during our interview the candidate brought out some food and started eating it in front of me without mentioning it.

However, both the person sitting directly next to you and, as you mentioned, several others were both distracted and annoyed by your actions.\n\n>I wasn't disturbing anyone\n\nOnce again, obviously false as the whole reason this was brought up for discussion amongst the office was that it WAS disturbing people.\n\nWorking at home is great, I do it every day, and it gives us all a great level of freedom to not really care what others think of what we do and how we look. However, when you go into a shared work environment, it is important to be cognizant of the needs of others. \n\nYou could have either cut short your workout (or woken up a little earlier) and eaten before leaving, or eaten on the way/before the meeting. You had other options. Those in the meeting didn't. They had to sit near you whether you were eating or not.", "YTA, not in a truly bad way but more oblivious I guess. It\u2019s kind of rude and distracting to eat in front of people who are trying to work, and bananas and peanut butter tend to be a bit smelly. \n\nIn the future read the room. If no one else is eating and people are giving you looks that\u2019s a good sign to save the snacks until break time.", "YTA. So you had banana peanut butter fingers, were taking your banana bites back out of your mouth, and were also taking notes on your computer? That would be distractingly disgusting to me if I was sitting next to you. It can be OK to eat in meetings (if you are hungry you can't focus as well), but it depends a lot on the food and the context. This was a job for a protein bar, cheese stick, or bag of grapes. You need to eat the banana PB combo in private. Like, always.", "YTA\n\nUnless the meeting specifically has food provided or is a brown bag training type thing, you don't eat during a meeting.

It's not appropriate.  \n\nI don't think it's like, career ending, but in the future eat before or after any trainings.", "Soft YTA, mostly because it sounds like you took your time to eat several bananas, over the course of all the training. Having a snack is one thing, but this seemed like a production. Also, smelly/noisy foods are a no go and bananas and pb have strong smells.

However it's definitely a \"read the room\" (and the rulebook) kind of things. Training and meetings are generally regarded as a bit more high priority than your general day to day grind, so it's expected that everyone pay their undivided attention.

It is disrespectful to be having even just a snack with a team on training as it can be distracting. It's not a movie marathon or a picnic, nor a casual  hangout. Training is work related, hence it is expected not to do any personal stuff while it's ongoing. Unless of course it is your company's culture to be doing so. If it really couldn't be helped, you could've at least asked, thought about how it could negatively impact others.", "YTA Eating in a meeting or training full of people is rude. And not because you are not sharing. I am mentioning this because you seem to think that the guy was annoyed because you didn't share.

Eww.", "Ya, one person chomping away in an otherwise quiet training can be pretty distracting. Since you rarely have to go in person on the days you do wake up 10 minutes early, shift your workout back and eat before the meeting. YTA.", "YTA\n\nGood rule of thumb is to only eat in meetings if food is provided. Sounds like you need to adjust your time and eat before your meetings. \n\nThe fact your we\u2019re biting pieces of banana off and dipping it sounds and probably looks disgusting.", "YTA. Just your description of biting off a chunk of banana, removing that chunk from your mouth, dipping it into peanut butter, then putting it back into your mouth... Super not okay during a professional training session.\n\nNext month, make yourself a smoothie with bananas, yogurt, and peanut butter and drink it on the way in, or while sitting in your training. But don't do *this* again.", "YTA. \n1. Once food enters your mouth, it does not exit it again in front of other people. Dude. Seriously? \n\n2. Don\u2019t eat in front of people who aren\u2019t eating during a non-eating activity. Eating is noisy, you don\u2019t sound especially like someone who chews with their mouth closed, and seeing masticated food is nauseating for most. It\u2019s distracting. You were in a work meeting!\n\n3. Don\u2019t eat smelly food in front of a captive audience. Peanut butter and bananas are both highly fragrant foods, bananas less so but still. \n\n4. Did you ask if anyone had a nut allergy? That\u2019s a risky game to play when you\u2019re on boarding at a company. Yikes. \n\nEat in your car before you enter work if you enjoy eating that way (taking bites of banana out of your mouth and then dipping them in peanut butter). OR eat at your desk with a utensil like a non-feral human.\n\nEdit to add: omg dude you didn\u2019t even have NAPKINS and you were then touching your computer? Pumpkin, that is so unhygienic and I really don\u2019t think you realize but VERY off putting and that level of lack of table manners will absolutely impact your career trajectory. I would highly recommend watching a few videos on general table manners so that you\u2019re not caught unawares again - you will feel more confident in eating situations and not wonder why people are looking at you strangely. \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA. \"I wasn't bothering anyone\".  Clearly you were.   PB stinks.  Also what if someone in that office had a peanut allergy?  You were eating food with your fingers in a professional setting.

How distracting.\n\nYou should be fully focused on your job.\n\nIf you aren't capable of feeding yourself before work, you aren't grown enough to have a job.\n\nOthers are having to follow the rules and it's annoying to reminded that you don't bother.", "I feel like this is an office culture thing, which can be hard to gauge when you work from home. I've worked in offices where eating during a meeting is fine and offices where is not fine. NAH, but I probably wouldn't eat in the meeting again.", "YTA - but I think without meaning to. It suggests that you're not fully engaging with the training, you're multitasking it with your own thing, which shows a lack of respect for the other participants and the trainers.\n\nIt's also a bit messy - you're touching foodstuffs and then touching equipment, potentially leaving residue on the equipment, and it also left a smell. Not everyone likes the smell of bananas, it's one of those scents that can linger for quite a while, so other people are then having to put up with that smell in what I imagine is a shared space environment. Your workplace probably has designate eating areas like a kitchenette or a break room and certain allotted times through the day where you can have a bite to eat and refuel. Instead of waiting for those times you went \"my schedule is more important than everyone else's\" which is a bit rude and disrespectful. \n\nAnd also your time management isn't great - like you I like to do an early morning workout before I get ready for work, but if I know there's something that's going to put a hamper on my time I make adjustments - for example if my partner has to leave early for their job and is likely to be needing to get in the bathroom at the time I'm usually in there, I will get up ten minutes earlier so I complete my workout and be out of the bathroom before they need to get in, or I will do a briefer workout if I don't fancy getting up. These are all considerations that need to be factored in. Hard as it might seem when you have a routine, your physical fitness is not going to derail completely if you do a slightly shorter workout or amend your timing a bit to achieve all your goals of a morning.\n\nSo apologies, because I can sympathise with you to a degree, but you're getting the YTA vote from me", "Yta, it's one thing to eat at your own desk or office but in a meeting or conference environment its quite rude to do so.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA. This really depends on the culture of the place, but I also know people who are highly sensitive to the smell of bananas. I\u2019m sure this would be made worse by being trapped in a meeting room for a training session rather than a more open office environment where someone who was bothered might be able to move away from you until you were done. \n\nI also bristled at the peanut butter. If someone has a severe allergy, even being in the same room with it can cause reaction. It\u2019s not cool to bring that into a required meeting without making sure there are no issues first. \n\nMaybe there is an alternative snack you could bring next time that\u2019s not as messy/smelly/potentially life-threatening?", "YTA - I guess.\n\nI don't know that it was asshole behavior, but it for sure was *unprofessional* behavior.\n\nIf you walk into a meeting and there is food and drink on a table for people to take and snack on, then it's expected that people will be eating those during the meeting or training.\n\nOtherwise?  This is work, not breakfast time.  No, you don't bring a meal to eat.", "I\u2019m going to be the lone NTA here, and I\u2019m basing this on my company culture. I work remotely but sometimes go into the office. We all eat during meetings, in person and on camera. It\u2019s not weird. We\u2019re humans with busy lives and sometimes work is so demanding I\u2019d have to choose EITHER lunch or a meeting, so I just do both. \n\nA banana and PB is fragrant but generally not a gross smell.

I workout wayyyy more than you and pretty much am eating non stop right now but holy crap biting a banana, picking the piece out of your mouth and dipping it in pb is actual goblin behavior.

Your coworker was looking at your banana because he was shocked you were eating so rudely at a meeting, not because he wanted one. You sound either selfish or socially inept to not have realized/cared for the negative attention you were drawing until the end.

No it\u2019s not a big deal in reality.  But there is a time and place for everything.  If you want to take a break and have your morning breakfast.  Do so, but to force everyone in a place where food is not normally brought, to have to endure the noises of your food and trust me, you are making noise despite you thinking your quiet, it\u2019s just inconsiderate.

If OP forgot to grab any silverwear and there was none in the office (which would be a surprise) then he should have either eaten during a break, just had the banana's only or should have read the room and not eaten at all.

When you work full time in an office, you are spending most of your life there. News flash, you eat during that time.\n\nI have never worked in an office where people weren't eating and snacking at their desks throughout the day. People often worked through lunch and ate at their desks. Our early risers almost always ate breakfast while in the office.\n\nHell, half the time there were donuts or bagels or other snacks out on a table for everyone to share anyway. At one office I worked in, senior leaders would take turns bringing in snacks or lunch for any trainings or all-hands. I had a boss who would throw laffy taffy at you if you weren't paying attention.\n\nIt's a banana and peanut butter, it's not like it's leftover fish in the microwave. Food is part of life and work.

Or see a problem with biting a banana.\n\nAlso maybe slice the banana because some can get dirty minds from having a banana in your mouth, especially in the work place.\n\nBottom line you cannot please everyone and unless your boss/supervisor says something to you then it's fine.\n\nIf you worry about it that much and don't want to offend, then just maybe make it a milkshake or smoothie in a cup which prevents the smell and is less visible as long as you don't slurp it loudly. It's still healthy to have a banana peanut butter milkshake or smoothie. The cup hides the smell and the look more and no risk of offending the less mature co-workers because you put a banana in your mouth.", "NTA\n\nUnless you are eating food that has a strong smell, or crunching and chewing loudly, I do not think that it is a problem, unless the meeting itself is very formal. If I am going to a meeting with supervisors or upper management, clearly I would not do that. If it\u2019s more casual or if you\u2019re with peers and circumstances dictate that you would otherwise be consuming a meal at that time, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. I remember when I was in college, and sometimes I had evening courses, between work and school, and I simply did not have time to eat a full meal.  I\u2019m not going to woof down fast-food in the car either, and spill it all over myself. I would sometimes bring salads or chicken and eat during class. I was not loud, and it was not food that people would consider odorous or annoying. If someone has a problem with it, so be it.  Maybe it\u2019s even slightly off putting or distracting, but it\u2019s not AH territory. \n\nI also do not think that it is any less annoying than people screwing caps on and off water bottles, or glancing at their phones, or getting up and going to the bathroom, or generally entertaining other types of distractions.", "Jeez. If I couldn't eat in meetings, I'd be passing out daily from lack of food! \n\nNTA but this does sound like an odd meal, I think it would have been more polite if it had just sent a cereal bar and a coffee or something.", "No, because apples are crunchier than bananas and would make noise. Bananas and peanut butter are a perfect snack during hands-off training.

The question is, what are you going to do about it?\n\nA few options:\n- Cut your workout short so you have time to eat before heading into the office.\n- If you absolutely must eat during your training due to low blood sugar, step outside, and make it quick.\n- Choose something fast and not smelly or noisy.

Peanut allergies are really common and you were really lucky none of your colleagues have it.", "I used to keep a bag of peanuts in my drawer at work for a quick snack. One day a colleague from another organization was stopping by and stopped at my door to chat. Her eyes got wide and she said 'do you have peanuts in here?!' I had not even touched them that day, they were in the drawer in the bag. She was deathly allergic and had superhuman powers of peanut detection. She was fine, but the peanuts went home that day and never returned.", "Also, peanut butter is a pretty common allergy and shouldn't be brought into shared spaces unless you know it won't affect others.

So OP was taking bites, pulling them out of their mouth with their fingers, dipping them in peanut butter (or rather scooping, I guess, PB is too thick to dip) and then eating them with their fingers\u2026 that would make me crazy in a meeting/training where I\u2019m supposed to be focussed on work and someone is there flailing around with banana.", "Yeah if OP was JUST eating a banana with pb that wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal but what he was doing sounds so gross.

I don\u2019t think people would\u2019ve cared as much if they just ate a banana normally instead of pulling banana chunks out of their mouth like a toddler. \n\nAlso I personally don\u2019t like listening to people eat, it\u2019s a gross sound. Listening to someone eat next to me during training would be incredibly distracting.", "Yeah. There was the option to just scarf a banana in the hall if OP was that hungry.", "Wtf?!? That is so off putting.", "Plus, PB is a major no-no to bring in a room full of people you don't know well. It is a common allergen.", "I don\u2019t think it was the smell that was bothering him, lol.", "You can\u2019t skip lunch.

It was an open floor clinic and her purse was under the folding table. I sat down and said \"you have peanuts nearby don't you\" and she was like \"oh my god I forgot, those are from my kid\" . It wasn't enough to cause a reaction but I could smell them. OP behaving this way would send me to the hospital, but then again, I'd speak up immediately as soon as I whiffed peanuts that he needed to put his PB away and probably be the new office hero for saving everyone from this display haha\n\nI have read that the only two allergens that are commonly airborne to that degree are peanuts and shellfish so I don't want to hear any \"well I'm allergic to peaches and.....\".
