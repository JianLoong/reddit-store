He said he\u2019d give it back to me after his mom did laundry, but unfortunately a few days after this happened he was killed in a bad car accident. Obviously I knew it wasn\u2019t okay to say anything before his funeral, but now that it\u2019s been a couple of weeks I\u2019m wondering if it would be okay to go to his family and ask them for my sweater? \n\nThe main reason that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s okay to ask is because I\u2019ve never met his family at all and I don\u2019t think they even know who I am, I knew this boy from being in school together but we weren\u2019t friends or anything. \n\nI did ask my older sister for advice but she said that if it were her, she just wouldn\u2019t ask because she would be worried about upsetting the boy\u2019s family. And I do agree that if it was just any random piece of clothing I wouldn\u2019t bother asking at all, but this is a sweater that I got on an important trip and it has the name of the place where I stayed so I do care about getting it back.

Yeah, idk, people are kinda jumping on you when you\u2019re just a teen too. I\u2019d you want it, ask nicely and with sympathy, but don\u2019t count of them giving it back.", "You csn't really replace memories. Theres respectful ways to ask, parents can be one way.", ">INFO: do you have anything of his that you also borrowed?\n\nNo, but I guess if the school hasn't cleaned out his locker I could maybe volunteer to bring his things to his family.", "they say right in the post that the deceased was specifically NOT a friend. which i'm having a hard time getting past because why lend clothing to someone you're not even friends with?", ">you would have made a greater effort over those three weeks to get it back\n\nPlease re-read. It has been three weeks since he let the other boy borrow his sweater. A few days later he died. When exactly should he have made a greater effort?", "OP is not comparing their \"loss\" to losing a child. No comparison possible, to be honest. Even so, it might look like a small thing to you but it clearly means something to OP and the fact that they have thought this through and are asking for advise demonstrates that it is an important thing.\n\nAs many have said in this thread, this should be approached in a careful way and preferably with one of their parents present.\n\nOP neither is the AH nor WBTA for asking", "Honestly I was just trying to be nice, he burned a big hole in his shirt and didn't want the teacher to see that he had his lighter out and get a detention so I let him wear my sweater to cover it. I wasn't expecting him to wear it home though.", "I agree, sharing a nice story about their son would balance out the awkward ask. \n\nIf you have any photos/videos to share with them they may like that too. Stories and photos always helped with my grief, I know everyone\u2019s different and sometimes seeing the photos/videos can hurt. So ask if they would like them before just sending them along.", "I was quite surprised to read so many others saying to forget the sweater, and just assumed that I just must not get it because I don't have kids. But this is exactly what I thought. Even if OP didn't know the kid well, I just think his family will cherish any stories people can tell them about their son, as hard as it might be. Even the story about how you ended up lending him the sweater. They'll appreciate that you were kind to him. Might not be good to tell them about the lighter, but ask your parents beforehand and hopefully they may be able to read the room for you. Sometimes you can just know that parents are aware of the sort of mischief their kids get up to, and are accepting, other times it might just upset them. \n\nIn my country we're a bit weird about funerals, I think it's a lot more of a celebration of someone's life than \"pure mourning and grief\", and I know our attitude is not universal, but I do believe every sharing memories is powerful. Good luck OP, be warned this will be emotionally hard.", "Lovely advice and I\u2019m sorry about your stepson \ud83d\udc9b", "I imagine it would make the boy's parents feel like once more they are able to take care of him and parent him a little bit by finding that sweater, which could probably bring some comfort.", "This is great advice.", "Meh, I take it to be a question about whether or not OP would be an AH for asking. This wasn't a confrontational situation and OP more likely simply needed advice on the best course of action to avoid being an AH.", "Shit good point. Changing mine though I\u2019m not top comment.", "I'd argue life, destiny, or whatever you want to call it, is a total asshole here...", "Completely agree. He's 14 and has enough insight to ask how to handle this. He's NTA.", "My cousin loaned one of her best suits (she's an attorney) to a friend who died of cancer. She wanted to ask for it back but got to the calling hours and realized they were burying her friend in it. Awkward...\nOp is showing a great deal of sensitivity and maturity through this post.", "That might be the case if it was an adult dying, but this is a child, whose family are probably absolutely devastated by their sudden loss, especially since it occurred in such a horrible way. It might be better for OP to wait a few weeks or months, because not everyone in the family is going to appreciate them asking for a sweater. It might be important to OP, but it's nothing compared to a family that can't ever get their child back. So OP needs to tread carefully and choose the right time to ask for it back.", "It\u2019s not necessary, but if there is a possibility that asking will put stress on a couple who are going through one of the hardest things a person can experience, then it could be wise to err on the side of caution and just replace the sweater.", "That's my fear.  If OP doesn't ask soon the family might get rid of his sweater. If they *are* giving away his stuff to others,  that's all the more reason OP should get his own item back.\n\nI do like the suggestions of having his parents call the kids parents, though.", "Yea, everyone\u2019s different. I\u2019ve had relatives make the deceased\u2019s room into a shrine and nothing leaves, while others donate a lot of it.", "This is a good idea! Ask that one of your parents comes with you and plan a bit of what you\u2019ll say to the boys parents. You\u2019re NTA for wanting the shirt back", "This is a nice idea.  When you arrange to go (do not just drop by) have something kind to say about the boy who died. Gently tell them that your friend borrowed your sweater and ask that when they are ready, could you possibly have it back. Also bring a casserole or something if possible.", "That's a brilliant thought!\n\nYou can also ask the school counselor to help you with this. Have a chat with them and tell them what you've told us here.  They may be willing to make a call for you or in some other way ease the way for you to interact with the parents. \n\nYou don't need to pretend that you had more of a relationship than you did with the boy who died.  He was a classmate and a decent enough person that, even without knowing him well, you were willing to loan him a sweater to help him avoid embarrassment when he had messed up his shirt.  That's a nice thing to be able to say!", "Maybe they\u2019re simply kind and generous.", "Op said in a reply they lent it because the kid burned a hole in his shirt during class", "I didn\u2019t say they did. Just giving perspective. I also didn\u2019t say they were TA", "that's very kind of you!\n\nas you get older you will find more and more that the general rule of thumb is you shouldn't lend out anything unless you accept that you likely won't get it back.", "Thank you", "That's literally not how the sub and voting works. If there's no interpersonal conflict, then it doesn't go on AITA. If there's potential for conflict and no one has been shown to be an asshole, then it's NAH. The ratings don't differentiate between situations; NTA means that OP is not an asshole and someone else is, regardless of how anyone tries to interpret it.\n\nFrom the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq), emphasis mine:\nNTA/YWNBTA or \"Not the Asshole\" is for scenarios where the OP is NOT to blame *and the other party described in their scenario is to blame*.", "The awareness this 14 year old has is outstanding. 100% NTA", "Oh jeez. What a ride of a short story ha . Awkward .", "Losing a child is a level of pain I hope I never have to experience. I genuinely cannot fathom how someone can get through it.\n\nWith that said, just because the sweater isn\u2019t important to them, it is important to OP, and so she has every right to seek it\u2019s return. I fully agree she should wait a while and approach very gently, but just because something isn\u2019t important to one person doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important to someone else.", "It's been 15 years so it's funny now... \ud83d\ude02"]}
