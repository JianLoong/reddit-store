He said he\u2019d give it back to me after his mom did laundry, but unfortunately a few days after this happened he was killed in a bad car accident. Obviously I knew it wasn\u2019t okay to say anything before his funeral, but now that it\u2019s been a couple of weeks I\u2019m wondering if it would be okay to go to his family and ask them for my sweater? \n\nThe main reason that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s okay to ask is because I\u2019ve never met his family at all and I don\u2019t think they even know who I am, I knew this boy from being in school together but we weren\u2019t friends or anything. \n\nI did ask my older sister for advice but she said that if it were her, she just wouldn\u2019t ask because she would be worried about upsetting the boy\u2019s family. And I do agree that if it was just any random piece of clothing I wouldn\u2019t bother asking at all, but this is a sweater that I got on an important trip and it has the name of the place where I stayed so I do care about getting it back.

There were definitely people talking to the family for a good length of conversation, and someone wrote and performed a song telling stories of their memories, and it was really beautiful.

Your mam will call you to let you know that Mary from down the road's brother has passed and the funeral is 11am Friday so you should be there.   \n\n\nWe have a lot of traditions around funerals and death, and it's very much about community coming together to support people and as sad as it can be it can also be really nice.  \n\n\nOP - I hope you get to talk to the family and maybe have some things to share. You could also ask other people who knew this boy to write down some nice memories in a book and give that to the family.
