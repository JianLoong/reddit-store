He said he\u2019d give it back to me after his mom did laundry, but unfortunately a few days after this happened he was killed in a bad car accident. Obviously I knew it wasn\u2019t okay to say anything before his funeral, but now that it\u2019s been a couple of weeks I\u2019m wondering if it would be okay to go to his family and ask them for my sweater? \n\nThe main reason that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s okay to ask is because I\u2019ve never met his family at all and I don\u2019t think they even know who I am, I knew this boy from being in school together but we weren\u2019t friends or anything. \n\nI did ask my older sister for advice but she said that if it were her, she just wouldn\u2019t ask because she would be worried about upsetting the boy\u2019s family. And I do agree that if it was just any random piece of clothing I wouldn\u2019t bother asking at all, but this is a sweater that I got on an important trip and it has the name of the place where I stayed so I do care about getting it back.

If you don't want the sweater to go to a charity shop, asking sooner is better. That being said, I will reiterate the need for compassion and understanding.

Along with some other suggestions that have been commented, I would recommend writing a letter or a card to give the parents. Maybe if you or your parents have the money you could give them an Uber eats gift card or something like that.

Its background discusses the value adults ascribe to unique objects based on the objects' histories, then discusses how this kind of reasoning seems to start early:\n\n>A striking example of the early value of unique objects is provided by Hood and Bloom (2008), who found that 4.5-year-old children with a strong emotional attachment to a special object (e.g., stuffed toy or blanket) chose that original object over an exact duplicate, after the researcher convinced the child that a duplicating machine could generate such an entity. In a second study, Hood and Bloom found that older children (6.7 years of age) placed higher value on an authentic object (spoon or goblet once owned by Queen Elizabeth II; participants were British children) than an exact duplicate. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027716301688\n\nThis is such a clearly established pattern of preferring the original to an identical duplicate that I'm skeptical your brain works the way most people's do in this way. There's nothing wrong with that; the reason I even knew about these two cited studies in the first place is that I like the brain enough to study it \ud83d\ude06\n\nI personally have an extremely strong sense that I could not transfer my feelings from one object to an identical duplicate.
