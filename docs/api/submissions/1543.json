YTA", "Yes, some of her criticism is correct, but she always goes to an extreme option of \"throw the whole man away\".\n\nLike with Page, the problem is that her boyfriend never pays for his part of their date/dinner. Page told us that when they are done eating and the bill comes, her boyfriend just sits in quiet and waits until Page pays for the entire thing without discussing it with her.\n\nMy advice in this situation is to actually talk about this with her boyfriend and don't just pick up the bill. This is an issue that could be solved by communication. \n\nBut Kelly goes to the extreme, says that a 26 yo man should know what he is doing and he shouldn't be \"pleaded with\" to pay for his own food. And Page's boyfriend coming from a poorer background isn't an excuse at all, because her amazing husband grew up in poverty too and he never done anything like that.", "Right? Instead of saying to Kelly \"not everyone can be a controlling tyrant like you\", she attacked the husband.", "What a ridiculous comment", "Hahaha, \"healthier and more natural\"...", "I got the impression that they were actually defending her husband.", "Damn I feel sorry for your partner and whoever you dated in the past if they didn't care about your safety", "I know. Can you imagine being married to someone who *shudders* cares about the safety and well-being of you and your friends. It must be so embarrassing.

I would be disgusted if my husband wouldn\u2019t do this.", "i mean\u2026. if they have shit boyfriends, why not? \nin this instance, it\u2019s too one sided for me to decide if her friend is dishing it out or not as i don\u2019t have enough info. being loving and caring is not being a doormat and wanting better for your friends and mentioning red flags is also not bad.", "How long has Page been with her boyfriend? 6 months - 1 year? Then yeah, maybe talk about it.\n\nA few weeks? I agree with Kelly a 26 yo man should know better. Sounds like she wants Page to have some dating standards. If I went out on an agreed date I'd expect to pay for my own half, he pays for his half. If a grown man did that to me, I'd pay, but I would certainly not have a 2nd date.", ".....but at 26 years old ya girl Kelly isn't wrong about that man. Sounds like Kelly enourages you ladies to have standards that exceed the level of a tree stump in New Orleans..... \n\nYou both have handled this situation horribly regarding unrequested input. HOWEVER, despite the shaping ofnthe narrative it sounds like Kelly absolutely is the person whose advice should hold more weight. It sounds weird but being in a healthy stable relationship helps you see through a lot of B.S. quickly and it does make you quick to \"throw the whole man away\". This likely isn't true for all but it has been in my case. \n\n\nESH but everyone has the opportunity to do better.", "I mean are we really going to pretend that 26 year old man doesn't know exactly what he's doing? The idea it can be solved by communication hinges on the bf either not realising he is taking advantage, or not realising taking advantage like that might upset his gf, or that he is ok with treating her badly until/unless she calls it out.\n\nI mean maybe something could be said for Page speaking to her bf once and leaving if he reacts badly or pretends he will change then does it again. But either this is a new relationship and he's already taking advantage that early, which is an indication she should get out before investing in him, or they've been dating a while and he's been taking advantage the entire time, an even worse sign.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what part of the last paragraph you have a problem with. Her bf *does* sound amazing and it's good to hear Kelly appreciates it and sings his praises, rather than take him for granted and thinking of him as weak, like you seem to.", "YTA. \n\nKelly is correct. It\u2019s not a small thing to expect someone else to pay for you every single time. It speaks to character - entitlement and selfishness. I would tell my friends to drop a guy who acted like that too. And if he or anyone else is trying to excuse his behavior by saying it\u2019s because he grew up poor, it\u2019s absolutely relevant for Kelly to share that her husband grew up poor and does not do that.\n\nAre you all in your early-mid twenties as well? That\u2019s old enough to have developed some pretty firm standards. Weeding out guys who are cheap, entitled, and selfish is a reasonable one. \n\nAnd \u201cdoormat\u201d is a weird word to give for the example you gave. He wants to make sure his wife and her friends get home safe. What a sweet, well intentioned man. That doesn\u2019t make him a doormat at all. The fact that you correlate kind behavior with \u201cdoormat\u201d says a lot more about your dating choices than her marriage. And it\u2019s super shitty that you insulted someone who has been nothing but kind to you when he wasn\u2019t even there to defend himself.", "I\u2019m sorry, but YTA. Everyone is right, the examples you keep giving we\u2019re all with Kelly. Throw the whole man away.\n\nPaige\u2019s bf manipulates her into paying every time they go out and instead of saying something to him she\u2019s venting to you.\n\nTo Kelly\u2019s point if you have to explain to your SO that they need to foot the bill sometimes then yea\u2026throw him away.\n\nSounds like Kelly is a great on BS from guys kinda friend. She has a gem and is encouraging you guys to get one.\n\nPaige sounds like the only doormat here", "Kelly isn\u2019t extreme there lol, this 26 year old man didn\u2019t suddenly black out every time a bill had to be paid, he\u2019s aware his gf is footing it. \n\nIf you don\u2019t agree with dumping the man, then don\u2019t\u2026? like you don\u2019t have to take her advice", "\u2026\u2026\u2026 I would tell Page to break up with him too", "Lmao.

He probably overestimates Page's wealth and doesn't realize that people straight out of law school don't make much money at all. Especially after Page had already footed the bill multiple times without a problem.\n\nI don't think it's that strange that he doesn't know how he should act when Page never told him. Communication is the answer here.", "Honestly, to me she comes off as a judgy, happy lady (and not the only one in this story), but to me for someone to be considered a doormat, the way OP thinks about the hubby, there is someone wielding the control. I don't know any of them, so how would I know, if she actually is controlling, especially since OP seems like an unreliable narrator?", "Why thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "Yes, communication, but that's a ridiculous excuse. If I went to dinner with a millionaire I would at least offer to pay for myself because that's the polite thing that everyone should know to do!", "How weird because as a lawyer, no one has ever expected me to pay for our whole bill every time we are out because I make more. I\u2019ve dated chefs and computer programmers and sales people and everything in between - never paid for every meal. Might split. Might take turns. Never had a single person, from age 25-33, expect me to pay for everything because they assumed I make more. \n\nPaige\u2019s bf is a bum. You can simultaneously also think Kelly\u2019s husband is *too* eager to help, but I bet you kept your mouth shut and got in his car and let him drive you home at 2 am. So how are you better than her?", "Even if Page makes a pile of money, the boyfriend still shouldn\u2019t be expecting her to pay for all their dates - and that really shouldn\u2019t have to be explained to him.", "Wow you are making up a lot of excuses for his bad behavior.  Wish you would put a little energy to defending your friend, Page.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if Page filthy rich. No one should ever just assume that someone should pay for all of their meals. He could\u2019ve communicated that he perceived them to have an income gap, and would she mind paying his way, instead of just feeling entitled for her to pay. It\u2019s okay for it to just be a dealbreaker that someone is entitled and can\u2019t communicate expectations. It probably should be. He\u2019s a grown man. Stop making excuses for shifty behavior.", "Why does any of this matter?\n\nAll you are telling us is that Page\u2019s boyfriend 1) Ignores standard social expectations such as addressing a mutual bill and 2) Does so because he presumes his date to be loaded and thus responsible for the bill. \n\nKnow who does that? Selfish people."]}
