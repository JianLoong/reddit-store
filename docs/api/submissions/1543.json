YTA", "Yes, some of her criticism is correct, but she always goes to an extreme option of \"throw the whole man away\".\n\nLike with Page, the problem is that her boyfriend never pays for his part of their date/dinner. Page told us that when they are done eating and the bill comes, her boyfriend just sits in quiet and waits until Page pays for the entire thing without discussing it with her.\n\nMy advice in this situation is to actually talk about this with her boyfriend and don't just pick up the bill. This is an issue that could be solved by communication. \n\nBut Kelly goes to the extreme, says that a 26 yo man should know what he is doing and he shouldn't be \"pleaded with\" to pay for his own food. And Page's boyfriend coming from a poorer background isn't an excuse at all, because her amazing husband grew up in poverty too and he never done anything like that.", "Right?

Then yeah, maybe talk about it.\n\nA few weeks? I agree with Kelly a 26 yo man should know better. Sounds like she wants Page to have some dating standards.

If a grown man did that to me, I'd pay, but I would certainly not have a 2nd date.", ".....but at 26 years old ya girl Kelly isn't wrong about that man. Sounds like Kelly enourages you ladies to have standards that exceed the level of a tree stump in New Orleans..... \n\nYou both have handled this situation horribly regarding unrequested input. HOWEVER, despite the shaping ofnthe narrative it sounds like Kelly absolutely is the person whose advice should hold more weight. It sounds weird but being in a healthy stable relationship helps you see through a lot of B.S. quickly and it does make you quick to \"throw the whole man away\". This likely isn't true for all but it has been in my case. \n\n\nESH but everyone has the opportunity to do better.", "I mean are we really going to pretend that 26 year old man doesn't know exactly what he's doing? The idea it can be solved by communication hinges on the bf either not realising he is taking advantage, or not realising taking advantage like that might upset his gf, or that he is ok with treating her badly until/unless she calls it out.\n\nI mean maybe something could be said for Page speaking to her bf once and leaving if he reacts badly or pretends he will change then does it again. But either this is a new relationship and he's already taking advantage that early, which is an indication she should get out before investing in him, or they've been dating a while and he's been taking advantage the entire time, an even worse sign.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what part of the last paragraph you have a problem with. Her bf *does* sound amazing and it's good to hear Kelly appreciates it and sings his praises, rather than take him for granted and thinking of him as weak, like you seem to.", "YTA. \n\nKelly is correct. It\u2019s not a small thing to expect someone else to pay for you every single time. It speaks to character - entitlement and selfishness. I would tell my friends to drop a guy who acted like that too. And if he or anyone else is trying to excuse his behavior by saying it\u2019s because he grew up poor, it\u2019s absolutely relevant for Kelly to share that her husband grew up poor and does not do that.\n\nAre you all in your early-mid twenties as well? That\u2019s old enough to have developed some pretty firm standards. Weeding out guys who are cheap, entitled, and selfish is a reasonable one. \n\nAnd \u201cdoormat\u201d is a weird word to give for the example you gave. He wants to make sure his wife and her friends get home safe. What a sweet, well intentioned man. That doesn\u2019t make him a doormat at all. The fact that you correlate kind behavior with \u201cdoormat\u201d says a lot more about your dating choices than her marriage. And it\u2019s super shitty that you insulted someone who has been nothing but kind to you when he wasn\u2019t even there to defend himself.", "I\u2019m sorry, but YTA. Everyone is right, the examples you keep giving we\u2019re all with Kelly.

She wasn\u2019t putting their husbands down. She was just talking highly of her own husband. You are the one offended by the comparison. My husband would absolutely come pick me up at 2am and drop all my friends off, he\u2019s not a doormat, he just loves me and would be willing to pick me up if that meant he could make sure I was safe.", "YtA\n\nYour standards are rock bottom and it's sad and pitiful watching you try to justify shitty boyfriends and be so patently jealous of Kelly. Sorry that she values herself and you don't?", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYour advice to COmmUnicate sucks. It goes both ways first of all. Body language is communication too. Your friend is complaining because her BF was showing trash behavior. He didn\u2019t even acknowledge the check when it comes. Grown ass adults would say something.", "Just admit you jelly of Kelly, OP. YTA", "YTA.  You should tell Kelly to knock off dissing other people's SOs, not do the same as Kelly.  Did it really make you feel better, attacking Kelly's husband?  Yeah, you know YTA, don't you.  Apologize.", "ESH. He might be a doormat, it\u2019s hard to tell from the example given. I don\u2019t love the fact he always pays for everything and the night time rides could be a rare favour. \n\nBut what do you want in a man? You seem to be defending the guy who never has any money. Or perhaps advocating for a guy who isn\u2019t considerate. I think you need to think more about that instead of blaming Kelly for being demanding or her husband for apparently lying down for that.", "YTA", "YTA. Have standards.", "My fianc\u00e9 would also from my friends and us off if I really wanted him too Doran make him a doormat \n\nYta", "NTA. It gets tiresome to hear and she needs to stop with the constant comparison.", "Damn I can't believe everyone is on her side\n\nNTA , no I don't think she should have free reign to criticize everyone but nobody can say a thing to her. Maybe I don't understand the social graces of female groups of friends, but she must know she picked her man because he was submissive and she needed to be in control. I don't see how pointing that out makes you an asshole", "YTA. She has a good man, she loves him and he obviously loves her, and you can't handle it. It just eats you up with jealousy that she's happy and you're not, so you lash out with this puppy doormat nonsense. You're an immature jerk. You CAN actually be happy for people when they have something good. Try it sometime.", "Nta her husband definitely isn\u2019t the man in that relationship. Screw her she can dish it but can\u2019t take it boo who for her nta", "And also, she thought insulting her husband that had nothing to do with that was an acceptable move.", "The part I find funny is that (if I\u2019m reading this right) OP finds it abusive that she has her husband give all her friends rides home\u2026but OP STILL takes the rides home. How you gonna criticize behavior while participating in said behavior?", "Supportive husband catching a stray!  Collateral damage!", "And she appreciates it so much! Honestly they sound like an adorable couple.", "I mean honestly he should throw them all away. They're waking him up at 2am to come drive them around when ubers exist? Let the man rest!", "I can sort of see your point but if a husband is acting sideways they should definitely be criticized as well.", "Thank you. Maybe submissive is a better word than doormat. \n\nI'm happy that Kelly adores her husband so much, but she needs to realize that not everyone wants such a subservient boyfriend/husband and disagreements are natural. She acts like whenever one of our boyfriends does something that we don't like, we should break up immediately and find a man who fulfills all our wishes.", "The woman is right, you are the wrong one, you seem bitter and jealous and that is a very ugly color", "Wait lmfao. Was this explanation supposed to make us side with YOU? jfc Kelly is right. You're just an asshole. YTA OP.", "But... Kelly is right, a 26 year old man should know what he is doing and shouldn't be pleaded with to pay for his own food. Her saying that is not extreme.\n\nIf Page cannot communicate with her boyfriend, then it's never going to be a good relationship and maybe she should consider ending it.", "Kelly is right. Why should it be a woman's job to fix a man's manners? That's ludicrous, and Kelly has good standards. You should too.", "So you want her to stay with someone whose an obvious homesexual \u2026he\u2019s using her", "You're a bad fucking friend. I hope your group dumps you, and sounds like you're well on your way there.", "I don't know what you expected coming to AITA, but 'throw the whole man away' is like the default advice here, too.", "Absolutely this. Could Kelly be annoyingly forceful about her opinion? Sure. But if Kelly's constant criticism is a response to y'all venting about your partners, then maybe y'all need to reevaluate why you have so much to vent about??? My friends and I seriously vent about our relationships maybe two or three times a year at most - every other complaint is something light/humorous or something we address/resolve with our partners directly before it becomes something worth venting about. I know my friends' partners really well, and if had to offer criticism about them, it'd be over something cheesy like working too hard/caring too much or having terrible taste in meaningless opinions (e.g thinking a hot dog is a sandwich). So if Kelly has a LOT to criticize about your partners, y'all need to start thinking about where she is getting this material from, and if it's directly from your own stories/experiences, then maybe you need to start reevaluating them.\n\nBc it is exhausting to be around people who complain about their mediocre boyfriends and their bare minimum behavior, but then try to excuse/normalize said behaviors when others criticize them, and then  inevitably come back a few months later complaining about the same or even  more bullshit that they still tolerate. And it's even more mind-boggling to see you feel/show resentment to the friend who thinks y'all deserve better than this instead of the boyfriends who clearly don't.", "This all really depends.\n\nThere was a \"sweet spot\" in my life where I don't think it would have been a big deal.  Post-kids, no way is getting up in the middle of the night anything other than the biggest favor in the world.  And when I was young and partying a lot, then this sort of favor could be way too regular an expectation.\n\nBut that time in my life when I did not get out for girls' nights that often - eh.  I could totally see telling my husband I was going to go wild for the night and booze it up, would he mind picking me and my friends up when we were ready to call it a night.  With the complete expectation that he would say yes.  And him having no problem doing so, happy to see us all safe home (and equally happy to have a rare night home alone).  Like it truly would not have been that much, if any, skin off his nose to pick me up in the middle of the night.  We would be having a lie-in that weekend anyway. \n\nWhat I think bothers me the most in OP's post about the husband being a doormat is there is no sign that Kelly is not also a kind spouse. Maybe she braves the hour long traffic jam to pick up her husband and his buddies from a Sunday game. Who knows. She definitely isn't shit talking her partner to her friends. The point is, doing big things for your spouse should not been seen as the behavior of a doormat, or the requests of a terrible partner, when a marriage seems stable and happy.  Chances are, they are BOTH giving the partner what they need.", "So what you're saying is, there's nothing inherently wrong with the boyfriend not offering to pay his share even ONCE - his only mistake was thinking Page is rich enough to afford it when she's not. \n\nYeah no Kelly is right, y'all's standards absolutely suck lmfao. I made literally twice as much as the last guy I dated and we still split the bill, and he treated me on my birthday. And that was just a casual summer fling, not an actual boyfriend. It's just fucking bare minimum manners to at least offer to pay for your part of a date, or offer to switch off, or to contribute SOMETHING at some point.", "You think it\u2019s normal he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to act\u201d when *how to act* is paying for his own food and bills?!?!", "My high school bf's parents were millionaires. Literally. Earned multiple millions every year. We still often went dutch or traded off paying, because I wasn't going to let him foot the bill for everything. If he wanted to go to a restaurant I couldn't afford, he'd let me know it was worth it to him, and he'd pay that one, and I'd later get picnic items and we'd go for a hike somewhere or go to the beach and have a picnic. That was high school. I make significantly more than my current bf. We have a similar set up regarding paying for meals.  \n\nIf a 26 year old doesn't know manners by now, he was raised poorly, regardless of income. Money does NOT buy class. Plenty of trash folks with a ton of cash. Plenty of very classy folks currently couch surfing. If Page wants to take over the job of parenting her bf and teaching him manners (his behavior demonstrates lack of class; that's an internal thing that I don't believe changes, but one can be taught to fake it), ok. Her call.", "But you didn't bother communicating with Kelly about the issues you have with her... Also grown-ass people don't need to be told how to act by their partners! It's common courtesy to pay for oneself when out to eat!!", "Ew. You're gross. He shouldn't be ASSUMING anything at all and just pull his own weight. Stop blaming your friend for y'all being immature and stupid.", "What in the everloving world of enabling justifications did I just read??\n\nThe man is in his mid 20\u2019s, regardless of what kind of people he has or hasn\u2019t dated, or how much or little money he believes the other person to have, I\u2019m pretty sure he knows that unless someone specifically offers to pay for him then any costs he incurs are his own responsibility. \n\nAre you honestly saying that it\u2019s acceptable adult behaviour to assume it\u2019s ok to mooch off someone just because you believe they have more money than you? \n\n\u201cAdults pay their own way\u201d isn\u2019t something that should need to be communicated in an adult relationship. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for that to be expected knowledge, and equally reasonable to end a relationship over as it\u2019s a sign of worse traits to come. \n\nI mean, if parents haven\u2019t bothered to teach their kid basic self responsibility then what else have they neglected to teach. (Usually it\u2019s how to do basic household tasks, how to properly manage finances, how to treat others with respect\u2026 all the incidentals that create toxic relationships.)\n\nYTA", "Um? Why you doing all these mental gymnastics for your friend\u2019s miserly bf? Shouldn\u2019t you be rooting for your friend and hoping she is dating the creme de la creme and not some gold digging lout? Because that\u2019s what a person who assesses someone\u2019s background, career, and sizes up their potential wealth into order to leach is. \n\n\nGirl. Just admit you don\u2019t like Kelly and leave her poor sweet husband out of this.\n\n\nYTA.", "\"I dont think it's that strange that he doesn't know how he should act when Page never told him\"\n\nWhat!? Why should she have to?? This man has been on this earth for 26 years, he knows that splitting a bill is basic decency. You're acting like a man wouldn't know how to wash his own ass unless a woman came along to Teach and Take Care of him. Jesus op, have SOME baseline standards for men.", "Why must an adult man be told to foot the freaking bill? It\u2019s not Kelly\u2019s fault she has standards and you have none.", "Funny how you keep answering that \"communication is the answer,\" yet YOUR method of communication was to childishly hurl insults at your friend's marriage. Communication, indeed.", "Dude he\u2019s 26 not 16", "Dude just say you like deadbeats. It\u2019s okay. We won\u2019t judge you and you can stop judging Kelly\u2019s husband.", "I\u2019m a lawyer. My girlfriend works in the service industry. She never acted like that and has always wanted to help share expenses where she can afford it. Page\u2019s boyfriend sucks and Kelly is right.", "Why didn't he ask her what it was like, then? Where is his drive and curiosity? If you're correct about his motives, then he is incurious as well as ignorant. Poor Page!\n\nBut i have more questions. If communication is so important to you, have you had an emotionally vulnerable conversation with Kelly about how her comments make you feel? Why are you getting tipsy and making cutting remarks about it? How is Kelly supposed to know that this bothers you unless you tell her?", "You\u2019ve got some low standards", "Genuine question: are you defending this guy's shitty behaviour because you do the same as him?"]}
