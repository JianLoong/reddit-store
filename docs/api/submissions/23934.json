That's simply untrue. We didn't meet yesterday and have known eachother for years. It is indeed an unhappy arranged marriage where the wife has been controlling of the whole household, including the in laws. She has personally told me when my husband and I married that I needed to assert dominance within the first three days.

You have no idea what's going on behind closed doors. She could easily be struggling with something like postpartum depression or the kid could have some health or attachment issue they haven't disclosed to you.

My husband will not communicate with the SO of my friend, that sounds so inconvenient.\n\n\n\n- I don't really get why they all suddenly have a sleepover with this friend? I recently lost my dad, but I didn't even have time to invite all my friends for a sleepover. I was too busy with arranging everything for the funeral, informing people and just keeping my sanity.

Ultimately you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with these people\u2019s lives, what she may need help with, and it\u2019s up to them to decide what works best for them. I get that it\u2019s a sensitive time for your husband\u2019s friend, but he wasn\u2019t alone, he had your husband. To be honest, it isn\u2019t really the norm to call your friends up in the middle of the night when somebody close to you dies anyways, that\u2019s normally something reserved for other relatives that were equally close to the person who passed. It\u2019s great if you have friends that are okay with that, but evidently it crosses lines for B and her husband.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need two people staying with him at the end of the day.

I think you made it passive aggressively, and are surprised B said something.", "YTA. I can't fathom a marriage like theirs surviving if he has a spine and she is really that controlling, but you have NO idea what's going on there. You didn't contact her out of concern, no, you just made a comment to make her feel ridiculous about a situation you have no background info on.\n\nHad you asked with good intentions you might have learnt something to base an actual opinion on, and even then it's not YOUR place to let her know your amazingly shortsighted opinion is on this matter.", "NTA but sometimes it's ok to have private thoughts.", "What concerns? What did she think he will do? Are those concerns legit? Or is she just obsessively possessive of him?\n\nI once knew a woman who couldn't be more than a few minutes at a time away from her children for 13 years. She would go ballistic if I proposed we hang out for coffee and go see an exhibition or something, calling me all kinds of names. I also had a cousin who wouldn't her boyfriend OUT OF THE HOUSE for 8 years. The poor guy eventually burnt out completely and literally escaped to Norway.

I thought this was incredibly heartless of her. \n\nThen I saw your edit, no she had that coming.", "YTA\n\nYou were unbelievably rude, intrusive, and your comments here about her being \"controlling\" are super problematic and reek of immaturity. As an older woman I normally hate the term \"Pick Me Girl\" but you absolutely radiate that energy. \n\nA grown man lost his parent. That's heartbreaking and yes, he deserved the support of his friends. That said, you keep arguing when people point out that a grown-ass adult losing a parent does not actually require a SLEEPOVER with multiple friends - you keep getting angry at everyone and being all, \"It wasn't a slumber party! He was grieving.\" Yup, he was grieving. Also, literally dozens of people are telling you that having a bunch of people sleep over because your dad died is . . . not a thing. Maybe ONE close friend so you're not alone that first night?

You UPSET HER. YOU were the controlling one. Like, do you not get that talking shit to someone about their marriage and family in a \"lighthearted manner\" isn't actually better . . . it's worse? Because you're both shitting on them AND not even doing it in a manner that says, \"I respect your relationship and family dynamic\"? \n\nAnd your whole \"she lives with her in-laws so she has plenty of help. . . \" Nope. Immediately not. You don't know that they're actually helpful. Hell, you don't even know that they don't make her life miserable and treat her like shit (which is often the case when people are forced to live in someone else's home for financial reasons). You made a bunch of assumptions, and tried to shame someone else and tell them how to run their family life, even after they explained to you that it was difficult and complicated. And why?
