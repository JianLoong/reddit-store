I meant it to be a light hearted joke.This is a basic explanation I stole off a Google search.\n\nA cake is \u201ca sweet, baked, breadlike food, made with or without shortening, and usually containing flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, eggs, and liquid flavoring.\u201d\n\nPie is defined as a baked food in a pastry-lined pan or dish that has a fruit, meat, pudding, or other filling, and it often also has a pastry crust on top\n\nThough they are both most certainly delicious, Im a cake lover, and personally thinks cake is a important food group. LoL", "A pie usually involves a flour based crust wrapped around filling of some sort, or layered in the bottom of a pan with the filling poured on top, sometimes with more crust placed over it, sometimes not. The filling is usually fruit, if intended for a sweet desert. Sometimes it's meat and/or vegetables, if intended as a savory entree.\n\nA cake is usually a mixture of flour, sugar, egg, butter and other flavoring ingredients that generally ends up as a uniform whole. If it helps, the English often use the word \"sponge\" when talking about certain varieties of cake. Us Americans will too, but less widely and usually in combination with cake (ie. sponge cake). Whereas, the English seem more prone to dropping \"cake\" off and leaving it implied.  Either way, the term sponge sort of gives a visual of the texture for a cake. (Though usually finer and much more tasty than a real sponge.)\n\nFrom your description of the crusts and the decorative top (latticework perhaps?) that you swapped for a crumb top, I'm guessing you were actually making pies.", "That might be how it goes then. That would be better than them witnessing all this.", "I could, but they would take it away from the kids with no remorse abs point the finger at me for being at fault because i only brought something for the kids", "Yes, she's a great kid!", "Well, I would probably get a lot of comments about me not being able to manage my time and not having my life in order because I could find time to bake something for them", "I honestly always hoped to grow into my grandmother's shoes who was awesome at baking and everyone loved what she made.", "I love both too! I just thought that cake means all baked, sweet goods and pie is just some group of it.", "Thank you for your detailed description!\nYes, in this case I was making pies.", "Strong disagree. It\u2019s a great example to set for them by showing them not to tolerate rude, ungrateful jerks even if they\u2019re family."]}
