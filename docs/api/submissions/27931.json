I meant it to be a light hearted joke.This is a basic explanation I stole off a Google search.\n\nA cake is \u201ca sweet, baked, breadlike food, made with or without shortening, and usually containing flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, eggs, and liquid flavoring.\u201d\n\nPie is defined as a baked food in a pastry-lined pan or dish that has a fruit, meat, pudding, or other filling, and it often also has a pastry crust on top\n\nThough they are both most certainly delicious, Im a cake lover, and personally thinks cake is a important food group. LoL", "A pie usually involves a flour based crust wrapped around filling of some sort, or layered in the bottom of a pan with the filling poured on top, sometimes with more crust placed over it, sometimes not. The filling is usually fruit, if intended for a sweet desert. Sometimes it's meat and/or vegetables, if intended as a savory entree.\n\nA cake is usually a mixture of flour, sugar, egg, butter and other flavoring ingredients that generally ends up as a uniform whole. If it helps, the English often use the word \"sponge\" when talking about certain varieties of cake. Us Americans will too, but less widely and usually in combination with cake (ie. sponge cake). Whereas, the English seem more prone to dropping \"cake\" off and leaving it implied.  Either way, the term sponge sort of gives a visual of the texture for a cake. (Though usually finer and much more tasty than a real sponge.)\n\nFrom your description of the crusts and the decorative top (latticework perhaps?) that you swapped for a crumb top, I'm guessing you were actually making pies.", "That might be how it goes then.

If so, I need that recipe!", "I love to bake and sometimes I criticize my own baking, but I've never EVER had family or friend criticize it!  I don't blame you one bit, it takes a while to bake, and if they're being critical, I'm glad you stood up for yourself.  \n\nIf someone makes the mistake of commenting badly in the future, hold up your hand and say \"STOP\" criticizing, if it's that bad then don't eat it.  Keep doing this until they all stop.  Or stop baking.", "Throwing it all away like you suggest is just a childish tantrum. Makes no point.", "I agree. OP shouldn't bother baking for them. If OP needs to bring dessert, just get a package of cookies from the grocery store. That way they can complain to their heart's content and OP won't have wasted any time or effort on them.", "Mostly because the kids are always happy to get them. They wouldn't get anything if I wouldn't bring them.", "Because I thought a pie is some sort of cake, but apparently it's two different things. I didn't know that.\n\nBecause I feel obligated. My late grandmother taught me how to bake and she would always be the one to bring baked goods. After she couldn't do it anymore I somehow took over her role and tried to fill out her role, because everyone always loves what she made. I didn't want to disappoint her.", "NTA bordering on E S H.\n\nJust stop being a doormat. What are you teaching your children?

And btw I did not make the dish icoorectly as I had imported the some imgredients to make it \"very\" authentic.

But you can only change you.\n\nWhen they say they are only trying to help you.

But I'm sure they do this  about other things too.\n\nI worry that your daughter is getting sad about how you are treated.  Empathy is a good thing, but sometimes too much empathy can also be destructive.  She could become depressed. \n\nMaybe look into some healthy ways to express yourself when your family do the putdowns and teach those ways to daughter.
