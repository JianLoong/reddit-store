But eventually I managed to get through those times and was able to get involved in her life again when she was about 11. We were very similar in looks & personality and clicked right away. We grew very close to each other and have a great father daughter relationship now. \n\nNow back to the present, my 21 year old daughter is set to get married next week. Months before now when she first got engaged, she initially told me that I would be the person to walk her down the aisle. Now at the last minute she told me she also wants her stepdad to walk her down the aisle since he's been in her life longer than I have and felt guiltily for leaving him out. I did not like the sound of that. My dream of walking my only daughter down the aisle did not involve another man in it. Especially when she initially told me it would just be us two. \n\nI told her that I didn't want to share this moment with somebody else as not only am I her biological father, but she already promised it would just be the two of us. She apologized to me and admitted she should've mentioned this to me earlier but felt she would regret not having her stepdad be part of the moment. I'm not too fond of her stepdad and hated the idea of having to share a moment that should exclusively be mine with him. I told her I would not go to her wedding if she decided to have us both walk down the aisle as I was not willing to embarrass myself. She left my house after that without saying a word. But she told my sister and parents about what I said. \n\nMy parents and my sister went off on me and told me I needed to put my pride aside for one day which is having me question as to whether or not I may have been a little childish in my response.

Nobody would see this as embarrasing. I remember seeing a video where the bride's bio dad went up to her step dad so they would both walk her down the aisle and it was really wholesome.", "Yes,YTA. He was a father when you were not. She has two dads, like it or not. And you need to get over it.", "YTA  \nThis is about her not about you.

Her stepdad is just as much a part of her life as you are, if not more. It's your daughter's day, and there's no reason you can't share the spotlight for 30 seconds. During your daughter's wedding, it's never about what you want. You go with whatever the bride and groom want.", "YTA. You may be her biological father but the stepdad sounds like he has been around plenty long enough to have played a part in raising your daughter. It's her wedding day, her choice just like it was your choice to take that break from her life and for her to take you back into hers.", "YTA.  This is not about you. This is not your day.", "YTA.

Being cared for- emotionally and fincially- is the real deal. \n\n\nIf she can get over the fact that you cared only for yourself for 10 whole years, you need to accept that someone else might now be just as important than you. \n\n\nPut her first.", "YTA. As much as I get that you'd want that special moment with your daughter, this day is about her and her partner, not about you. By what you're saying I understand her step-father is a pretty important father figure for her as well, so it's normal for her to want to share that moment with him too. \n\nDon't do this to her and make her remember this event as an event where she had to choose between two people she loves, when it should be a happy day for her. Respect her decisions.", "YTA. Both of you're important people in her life, it's not unreasonable for her to want to reflect that in her wedding.\n\nYou're basically threatening not to go to your own child's wedding, and making this all about you, and your issues about her step-dad, rather than making it about her having the wedding she wants\n\nIt's OK for you to have feelings about it, and to feel a bit hurt that she didn't talk to you earlier, but your reaction is way over the top. \n\nWalking her down the aisle with her step-dad wouldn't involve you embarrassing yourself. Throwing a antrum and refusing to go to her wedding in a fit of pique, on the other hand definitely means you are embarrassing yourself, and no doubt upsetting and hurting your daughter.  Be thankful that she had a supportive, loving step-dad, would you rather the had spent her childhood being bullied or unhappy?  Be thankful she has grown up to be the kind of person who has space in their heart for more people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour daughter's wedding isn't about you.

YTA", "YTA. It's her wedding day, not yours. You said that the stepdad has been in her life longer than you, clearly they have a good relationship too then and she considered him a father figure. Surely you must be glad that her stepdad has had a positive impact on her life and not been a shitty step parent.\n\nAlso, to then turn around and say you won't go to the wedding at all if it doesn't go your way... That's very childish. You would rather not see your daughter get married than share the 3 minutes it might take to walk down the aisle with another man that she also considered a father. At this rate either she accepts you uninviting yourself or your going to guilt trip her into doing what you want her to do - either way it sounds like you want her to look back on her wedding day and regret whatever choice she makes.", "YTA - this isn't about you, but about her and what she thinks would best represent her love union, her life, and the important people in her life on such a big day.\n\nYou do get to decide whether you would want to be there for her in that, but you are not in the right to be jealous and possessive about how she would like to honour the important people in her life.", "YTA. I\u2019m sure your daughter didn\u2019t want you out of her life as often as you were but you were. She wants her SD there and the LEAST you can do is be a supportive father and man up, walk on one side of her while the man who raised her walks on the other side", "I have a tricky family situation and my parents/step parents have similar relationships to you and your daughter's step dad by the sounds of it. For something as special as a wedding day, I'd expect you to put it to one side because that occasion isn't about you, it's about your daughter and her partner.

You are her one and only biological father no matter what. I'm so happy that you've been reconnected, she obviously loves you and cares about you so much. However she also might love her step-dad, which is a obvious fact since she wants him in the aisle also. You may not like the guy, but it shouldn't matter bacause your daughter does.\n\nIt's understandable that you wouldn't be happy sharing this moment with the step-dad, and it would've been okay to even let your daughter know that. But telling that you wouldn't be there just beacuse you can't put your daughter's happiness over your \"pride\" is an AH move. Yes, YTA.", "YTA.\nIt's her wedding, not your special day. Also, her stepdad probably shaped a big part of her childhood and I assume she's close to him as well, if she wants him to be there in addition to you.\nYour choice - swallow your pride and enjoy your daughter's wedding, or miss it.\n\nBTW, what would be embarrassing about walking her down the aisle together with her other dad?", "YTA, like you said he was in her life when you weren\u2019t, the fact you guys were able to build a father daughter relationship is great but it\u2019s also very understandable why she would want him to walk her down the aisle too. It\u2019s her day not yours, put aside your pride for the day and let her enjoy it.", "YTA\n\nAnd you broke your promise as a parent to not abandon your child. But she forgave you. \n\nYou should be thankful that her stepfather raised such a kind & forgiving woman. \n\nYou should be thankful for every minute she allows you to be in her life. \n\nInstead you are throwing a tantrum cause you were asked to walk with her & the man who never abandoned her down the aisle AND threatening to abandon her again!  You never put your daughter first & you still aren\u2019t.", "So she feels her step dad is a big part of her life since you weren\u2019t there for all of it. She wants to honor him in addition, not to the exclusion, of you. Your response is to threaten to abandon her again? YTA.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your daughter\u2019s day and your daughter\u2019s decision. \n\nIf you don\u2019t go to the wedding, you\u2019ll live to regret it.

Why is it that you are allowed to let your emotions take over and abandon people when you are hurting, but she can\u2019t decide that her love for her stepfather is an emotion worth exploring by involving him in her wedding? You\u2019re being selfish and showing her, once again, that your needs and feelings come before everyone else\u2019s.
