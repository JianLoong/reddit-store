{"id": 8494, "submission_id": "10n95cr", "title": "AITA for taking an international trip instead of babysitting my niece?", "selftext": "I (F22) started a new, (much) better-paying job about a year and a half ago. I had been struggling to pay my bills for some time, but I\u2019m finally back on my feet and have even been able to save a good amount of my money. I set this money aside specifically to cover potential travel expenses. In August, I made the decision to take a trip to Japan in mid-to-late February to celebrate my birthday (leaving on the 12th and returning on the 19th). I went ahead and booked a flight and a room, and have been making reservations for restaurants and activities over the past few months.\n\nThe issue, however, is that my sister Mia (23) is pregnant with her second child and is scheduled to be induced on the 11th of February (her original due date was in early March). Yesterday, Mia called and asked me if I could babysit her daughter Annie (2) for a few days while they are in the hospital. I told her that I will not be able to because of my trip, but I offered to take Annie on the 11th and pay for a nanny for the rest of the time. I also offered to take Annie to our parents\u2019 house when I leave on the 12th, since they live near the airport, and pick her up and bring her home on my way back from the airport on the 19th. \n\nMia was unhappy with my suggestions and asked me to reschedule my trip. I told her it was my birthday trip and I couldn\u2019t cancel last minute without losing out on a lot of the money I already spent, but I explained that I\u2019m willing to help in any other way that I can. Mia got angry and started yelling at me, calling me an AH for choosing my trip over my own niece in a time of need, especially since I \u201chave so much extra money that I can use to plan a different trip\u201d.\n\nFeeling frustrated and hurt, I snapped and told Mia that I don\u2019t want to have kids for a reason, and that her children are not my responsibility, and that I would not cancel my expensive birthday trip just because she didn\u2019t have a better birth plan. I love my niece so much and I love babysitting her when I can, but I think Mia\u2019s request is unreasonable. \n\nAnyway, our parents are saying that my sister and my niece should be my priority right now, but they also offered to take Annie while I\u2019m gone. I do think I could have handled the situation better, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TA here. What do y\u2019all think?

So your life is supposed to stop, because your sisters having a kid. Fuck that. You were more than reasonable with the alternative options you were going to provide. \n\nNTA. Hope you have an amazing time on your trip!", "NTA. You offered alternatives, and even generously offered to pay for them. As you said, your sister's children are not your responsibility.", "Nta. It sounds like you were trying to be accommodating and you offered other options to help. Enjoy your trip", "NTA. Your family is being unreasonable. Bring your niece back a cool present. Have fun on your trip!", "NTA. You offered reasonable solutions. It\u2019s ridiculous to ask you to move your trip for her.", "NTA. She wants a free babysitter- she is unreasonable, as is your entire family. \n\nEnjoy your trip to Japan!", "lol NTA.\n\nPoor planning on her part doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on yours. She\u2019s known for months that she\u2019ll be giving birth in this time range and seems like she didn\u2019t plan anything beyond banking on you saying yes without actually asking you prior.\n\nEnjoy your trip.", "NTA. Your sister sounds jealous. Also, understandably stressed out. But I absolutely wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to change travel plans for my birth plan. Except my spouse.", "NTA - you were more polite with Mia than I would have been.  Her poor planning does not entitle her to derail your established, expensive plans, particularly when other options are readily available.  How you avoided a \"GFY, Mia\" I'll never know.", "NTA at allllll\n\nShe just stomped all over you, your life etc because she feels her needs are more important. Narcissistic imo", "NTA, you have made prior plans. It\u2019s not like you intentionally made plans after your sister asked for help. Even so, no is a complete answer.", "Annnnnnddddd the baby daddy is where in all of this? NTA", "NTA\n\nSorry where do these people come off thinking they can just get you to reschedule your trip. You\u2019re busy!!! That\u2019s the end of the conversation! \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong OP, in fact you went above and beyond with your suggestions.", "I want to go maldives this year", "NTA. You have had an expensive trip planned. Your sister is having the baby earliest than intended.  She is not respecting the time or money you have invested in this trip.  Also, you aren't her only option for childcare.", "NTA. You offered excellent alternatives!", "NTA\n\nYou did everything right. You offered to babysit on the days you can, even offered to pay for the days you can't.\n\nI'm not sure how your family is, but I'm gonna give your sister the benefit of the doubt and that's the pregnancy hormones talking. It might stem from jealousy that you make a lot more money and get to travel around, while she has to be responsible and \"imprisoned\" with her kids.\n\nIf you think your sis is a good person, just give her some slack and don't hold a grudge against her. GJ on offering her the right suggestions and GL and HF on your trip!", "NTA\n\nIt seems you put in a lot of hardwork to reach where you are right now. I do understand that feeling. I too had a similar journey. It seems rewarding and hence taking a well deserved vacation is no problem at all. \nWhile you sis seems like an A because she is only seeing herself right now and does not care about your life. \nGo on and enjoy a good and well deserved vacation. When you come back... do bring presents for her and the child. Hopefully all goes well fo you!", "NTA. You planned first before she did.", "I'd tell your parents that if they can't make your sister and neice a priority, why should you? It's their daughter and granddaughter.\n\nThey can watch the kid.\n\nNta", "What the fuck? Why is this your problem, and why are you bending over backwards to figure out your sisters childcare (is paying for a nanny, dropping your niece off at your parents, etc?). Your sister & your parents are entitled assholes & I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA.\n\n\nAlso no, family does not come before yourself, for a good life we need to be better to ourselves. You did more tha enough with offering help in other ways and you do not need to change major plans for someone who seems to be stuck on an idea out of jealousy.", "NTA. The only people who your sister and your niece *must* be a priority to are your sister and her partner. While it is *nice* for family to help, you have absolutely zero obligation to help her or her children. For your sister to just assume that you will help and to demand that you change your plans and lose money is entitled to the extreme.\n\n\"If you want me to help you I expect to be compensated for my loss. I will lose $xxxx if I do not go on this trip, so that is what it will cost for me to stay and look after your child. My finances are none of your business and I have money and time to travel precisely because I don't have children. If you want me to take care of *your* child, the result of your responsibilities and choices, this is what it will take. My first offer is off the table, this is the only offer I am providing. Take it or leave it.\"", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is unreasonable. And you offered her alternatives that you didn't even have to. You could have just said you have a trip and it should have been enough. Who is she to tell you to rearrange your life and lose money because she wants things her way. \nGo and enjoy your trip, girl! You deserve it!", "NTA.  Your sister is expecting you to live your life by her schedule.  It's not your problem if you aren't available to be your sister's slave 24/7/365.  You do have your own life to live.", "NTA You did well. I think you need to tell both your sister and parents that they need to fundamentally revise how they see you. You are not going to live your life focused completely on your sister and her children, no matter how much you love them. You are not working so that you have money to spare so you can afford to drop everything at the drop of a hat to babysit at your sister's convenience, and you not having children does not make you the automatic babysitter on call who has no life outside of that.\n\nYou deciding to not have children means that you have sacrificed the joys that come with having them, but that sacrifice comes with the upside of being free to spend your money and time on other things in your life. You did not do it so that your sister can have her cake and eat it too, having the joys of parenthood while having you on hand to cushion her life and minimize the sacrifices she has to make that come from her choice to be a parent.\n\nIt's not like you aren't helping out, either. You are already helping her with time, money, and babysitting. More than enough. She should be grateful.", "NTA. Why do people think that other people will cancel things for them because of an inconvenience on their part. \nAnd an early happy birthday and enjoy your trip to japan.", "NTA. In fact, you have gone above and beyond (offering to pay for a nanny!) in order to try and help your sister. Your vacation was planned for this date before her induction, clearly.", "Wtf\n\nNTA \n\nYour parents can drive up and pick up their precious grandchild. \n\nNo way would I cancel an overseas trip to babysit my niece. And I have my niece all the time and love her too bits. But no! My life comes first.", "NTA you offered a fair compromise and she shat on you.", "NTA I really don't het this overhyped \"but family\" yes family but each person in a family is entitled to be a person on one's own, and you have no obligation to waste money bc of her demands", "NTA\n\nI feel like every childfree person has inevitably had that \"I don't have kids for a reason!\" blow up with those who assume that we should just be ready, willing, and able to take on their kids at a moment's notice, regardless of if we have plans or not.\n\nI would, however, caution you against taking such an expensive trip when you admit that you had been struggling to pay your bills and are just now getting back on your feet.   Definitely take the trip at some point (Japan sounds beautiful!), but maybe hold off until your financially secure, should something happen to this job as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
