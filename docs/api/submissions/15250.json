I have a brother (13) and sister (15). My parents left last year without any notice and didn't came back, so raising them fell on my shoulders. I can't leave them or drop them off at a relative's house because they love me so much and don't want to be separated from me. So they stay with me.\n\nMy girlfriend wants to move in with me because she is having trouble paying her bills. I thought moving in with her would help me too because raising two siblings and paying the bills at the same time is very difficult, she'll atleast cover 1/4th of the rent. But I had some doubts about getting together as she always makes excuses while paying large amounts, I said yes after some thought and asked her to pay her share regularly without any excuses. She agreed but insisted that I should leave my siblings at a relative's place as I would ask her to take care of them. I said no, I will take care of my siblings, I am taking care of my siblings since last 1 year she has no need to take care of him. I will pay for them and feed them. But then she said, they will come between us and it is better to leave them at relatives' house. I said I can't leave them so if she wants move in with me she has to accept my siblings. She doesn't take it well and says I don't want to move in with her and I'm making excuses. She's calling me asshole because she thinks I'm gonna ask her to pay for my siblings, that I'm clearly not. Her friends even tell her that I might be cheating that's why I'm not moving in with her. She did get angry with them and said that if they accuse me of cheating again, she will have to take action against them but she's really having some doubts now. Her friends are texting me and harassing me too because according to them I'm ruining our and their relationship too.\n\nAITA here??\n\nNote: When my parents left my siblings, my siblings were staying at my grandparents' house for a three day vacation. I asked my grandparents if they could take care of my siblings but they are now 74 years old and they barely managed to take care of them for 3 days and they can't take care of two teenagers full time now.", "created_utc": 1681995612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sxvdj/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_has_to_accept/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Odds are that won\u2019t change and you\u2019ll eventually end up footing her percentage of rent, if not other costs. The way someone handles their finances is a huge deal, especially in relationships. \n\n2) More concerning is that she has a problem with your siblings. What kind of person would want abandoned children to move out of their stable home with someone they trust and love? This is a very selfish request by her and it\u2019s a clue to her true self. \n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them. She is showing you what kind of person she is.", "NTA.\n\nShe says they will come between you and her after she moves in, but she is openly trying to come between you and them now. \n\nShe and her friends seem to live in a very different world where family responsibility is completely meaningless, so that there must be some other reason you insist on taking care of your siblings besides the fact that you care about them.", "NTA but have you talked to the police about child abandonment, or a lawyer about getting child support etc.", "NTA. You and your siblings are a package deal that can't be split. She is very selfish to think that family can be dropped that easily, like they are a rabid dog or a goldfish.", "NTA. Family comes first. However you should realize that after you and this girl break up, it will be hard for a person to not view it as you having two kids, so this might be something you need to consider if you want to have a serious relationship. Gotta express that y'all are a package deal", "NTA. Get a new gf though, you guys are not compatible. She does not accept your children. They may be your siblings, but in all actuality, they're your children now. Your relationship with her is doomed. There is no reason to have her move in when you're just going to break up down the road when she does or says terrible things to the kids to try to get them to leave.", ">My girlfriend wants to move in with me because she is having trouble paying her bills.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>I had some doubts about getting together as she always makes excuses while paying large amounts,\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>She agreed but insisted that I should leave my siblings at a relative's place as I would ask her to take care of them.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>But then she said, they will come between us\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>She \\[...\\] says I don't want to move in with her and I'm making excuses. \n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>She's calling me asshole because she thinks I'm gonna ask her to pay for my siblings, \n\nI know this sub loves to toss around the term 'gaslighting' over every little thing, but for her story to shift so much and then BLAME YOU....   wow. \n\n**It sounds like she wants to have a paycheck and fears that if your siblings are there she can't bleed you completely dry.**   \n\n>Her friends are texting me and harassing me too because according to them I'm ruining our and their relationship too.\n\nPeople like this often tell their friends distorted versions of reality, to have people on their side and to reinforce the delusion. \n\nNTA.   \n\nI know this sub loves to default into telling people to break up, but this time I would have to agree.", "NTA, she forced an ultimatum and got upset when you picked the obvious choice. It shouldn\u2019t have fallen on you to raise these kids, but you\u2019re doing an incredible thing for them. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t respect that, and it looks like your relationship has a pretty much over", "NTA. You're doing your damnedest to care for your younger siblings. And she's dated you for this whole past year knowing it. You considered letting her move in for *her* benefit. Beggars can't be choosers, and trying to get you to kick them out in favor of her is downright selfish. Stand your ground, and protect your siblings. It's obvious that they're grateful for what you do for them.", "NTA , huge respect towards you for taking care of your siblings", "NTA - you are a compassionate and decent person for taking in your brother and sister. They need you and any normal person would accept this and commend you for it. Your girlfriend, however, is not  a good person. Instead of supporting you through all of this she\u2019s jealous of your siblings and would rather see them abandoned than part of your lives. Let your girlfriend take her selfishness and ultimatums somewhere else. I know that with all the good you are putting into the world, you will find the right person for you soon.", "NTA\n\nShe's forced the issue of your siblings coming between you. She'd probably pick fights if she moved in.

In fact, I'd be thinking long and hard about whether this is the right relationship for you.  Your siblings have been through enough already, being abandoned by their own parents.  They don't need your GF treating them like unwanted additions to her own life.", "NTA\n\nYour siblings rely on you. They come first.\n\nYour girlfriend, and especially her friends, do not sound great; and I would be very hesitant to bring them any closer to your family.", "NTA  \nStaying with you is clearly the best option for you siblings.  \nYour gf and her friends need to understand that you have a certain responsibility and can't just be expected to give it up.  \nShe has to trust that you won't make her pay for the siblings, especially given that you are helping her out by allowing her to move in while she is in a tight spot.", "NTA You are their guardian. This is equivalent to her telling a single parent to get rid of their kids! Her audacity and entitlement is mindblowing!\n\nNo, you NEVER owe it to a partner to stop caring for dependents at said partner's request. You should recognize this for the huge red flag it is and break up. You'll have no trouble finding someone better.", "NTA. Awww Op you're such a great brother! Honestly I wouldn't let your gf move in. The fact that she wants you to drop your siblings just so she gets your 100% attention and I'm guessing YOUR help with HER bills is a massive AH thing of her to do. \n\nHer friends are also huge AH's because they're freaking hypocrites!  It's funny how the siblings that are basically your children at this point are \"in the way\" and \"ruining your relationship\" yet her crap friends have no problem sticking their noses into your relationship... smh", "NTA, you've take an adults responsibility and you should be praised for that. \nyou're giving your siblings a stable home, not abandoning them.\nyour gf needs to work on her priorities.. if she doesn't want play house, and be a supportive partner to you and help, she absolutely doesn't have to and should not move in.", "NTA. you and your siblings are a package deal and if she can\u2019t accept that, she shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship. relationships come with compromises and care. if you have been with your siblings to the point where you are a parental figure to them,  they aren\u2019t just an object to send away for her advantage. assuming she knew about the siblings as she started dating you, it\u2019s wrong of her to assume that you would prioritize her over blood relatives.", "NTA. Yikes. You're a good brother for sticking by your siblings' side. I don't know why your gf and her friends don't see that, but you're not wrong to tell all of them that it's family first. She can either work with that or find a guy who doesn't care about his siblings.", "NTA. Your siblings are, basically, your children now. You are their guardian. You are raising them. Is there any situation where it\u2019s acceptable to start dating someone with children and then insist that for the relationship to advance the children need to be given to someone else to raise? I don\u2019t think so. The fact that she\u2019s insisting you\u2019re using your siblings to avoid advancing your relationship while demanding that it\u2019s either her or your siblings, I think it shows the destiny of this relationship.", "NTA you are effectively the parent for your siblings now, so they are part of the package deal for your girlfriend now. I would get it if you were asking her to help pay for the children, but you specified they you're weren't. Definitely not the AH. What does she want you to do with the kids if they don't stay with you? Give them to your grandparents, who are too old to raise children, or to the foster system? Those don't sound like good options to me.", "She is correct, the kids are coming in between you two. Time to break up with her. NTA.", "NTA - but how many red flags do you need? She is twisting your words and lying to friends even before she moved in...", "NTA - First of all you are doing an amazing thing by taking care of your siblings instead of leaving them to another relative\u2019s house (which they could feel it\u2019s another abandonment from someone they love). Your Gf needs to realise that they are your priority, they are minors and have no one else. If she can\u2019t accept it, living together won\u2019t work. Also, she needs new friends because they clearly are toxic !", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend is pretty cruel that she thinks it's ok to abandon kids who have already been through trauma. Damn. \n\nYou are an amazing brother.", "NTA. You are a package deal. Rehome your GF if she doesn't understand that.", "NTA. You are doing what is necessary to keep your family together. That's really wonderful and shows how mature you are to take on this responsibility. Your girlfriend and friends are wrong here. Would any of them abandon their siblings under the same circumstance?", "NTA. Your siblings were living there first and she is the one who asked to move in because she was struggling. She is in no position to be making these stipulations. Let her know you\u2019re willing to get together and discuss boundaries prior to her moving in. But your siblings living elsewhere is non negotiable. If she won\u2019t go for this, you may need to rethink the relationship.", "NTA and probably need to consider the relationship overall. She is probably right that SOME responsibility might crop up occasionally with her as an adult living there but she needs to accept that if dating a guardian of teenagers that they will be present - sounds like you're a package deal, nothing wrong with that but she needs to decide if she's OK with that.\n\nTo be honest it sounds like the moving in is purely about the money for her rather than your relationship.", "You are raising your siblings\n\nThe sad reality is, you are not compatible with your girlfriend\n\nShe wants a single guy with no responsibilities to date\n\nThat's not you\n\nAnd now she has her friends harassing you\n\nDo the right thing and break up with her before she does something crazy like fake allegations to have the kids removed from your home\n\nNTA", "NTA.

It's something to be admired, not criticized or admonished, and anyone partner that tries to come between that should be shown the door.  \n\nThat audacity of her to say \"drop off the kids with a relative\"- as if they haven't already felt a huge sense of abandonment.  And what about you and how this has effected you?  She's asking you to send away your biggest sense of family now.

YOu need to protect your siblings from her hostility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Dio not let her move in, you will just have to pay for one more dependent ... and she will make your sibling's lives hell.", "NTA. She is trying to get between you and your siblings, not the other way around.

Don\u2019t move in with her and I would question staying in this relationship.", "NTA. But I want to tell you that you are absolutely amazing for taking care of your siblings and putting them first.

Your  GF is TA btw.", "Nta. If she's unable to pay her own bills chances are she's going to mooch off of you. Your siblings have gone through enough, please don't expose them to this girlfriend on an every day basis.", "NTA: if she can't accept your living situation you should definately go your separate ways.

Too many people enter a new relationship and expect the other person to throw out all their old commitments.\n\nIf she thinks you're cheating, so what?  You know the truth.  Prioritize your family.  She's probably doing you a favor by showing her true self.\n\nYou want to be with someone who loves you and understands your need to do the right thing while also sharing at least the willingness to take care of children who lost their parents.", "One of the clearest NTA I've seen. Your siblings rely on you, you are their guardian, you are a family unit.\n \nIn all honesty, the money issue you mentioned, should be enough to raise alarm bells, but her wanting you to dump your siblings, after they've already been abandoned by your parents, is a major red flag.\n \nDo yourself and your siblings a favour, and leave your girlfriend with some relatives!", "NTA, what an amazing brother you are!!

Even with the best intentions and extensive planning, it's going to affect anyone that dates you or wants to move in together with you.  I commend you for taking on the responsibility but hopefully you're aware that this is your life now until your brother and sister are out on their own and you are no longer their primary caretaker.\n\nThat being said, the solution should be she doesn't move in.  I don't blame her for being 24 and unprepared to live with her bf that is the defacto parent of two teenagers.

I would never offload them for anyone. We were a package deal. \n\nThe only thing I will say, is it may be naive to assume she wouldn't have any involvement with these kids. Another adult moving in, they undoubtedly will have an impact on them and in times of need will help care for them. Even just doing chores is a way of participating in their care. And it's okay for her to not want that - but that makes her incompatible with you. And that's really what it comes down to.
