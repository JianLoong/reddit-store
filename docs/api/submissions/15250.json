I have a brother (13) and sister (15). My parents left last year without any notice and didn't came back, so raising them fell on my shoulders. I can't leave them or drop them off at a relative's house because they love me so much and don't want to be separated from me. So they stay with me.\n\nMy girlfriend wants to move in with me because she is having trouble paying her bills. I thought moving in with her would help me too because raising two siblings and paying the bills at the same time is very difficult, she'll atleast cover 1/4th of the rent. But I had some doubts about getting together as she always makes excuses while paying large amounts, I said yes after some thought and asked her to pay her share regularly without any excuses. She agreed but insisted that I should leave my siblings at a relative's place as I would ask her to take care of them. I said no, I will take care of my siblings, I am taking care of my siblings since last 1 year she has no need to take care of him. I'll take care of them. But then she said, they will come between us and it is better to leave them at relatives' house. I said I can't leave them so if she wants move in with me she has to accept my siblings. She doesn't take it well and says I don't want to move in with her and I'm making excuses. She's calling me asshole because she thinks I'm gonna ask her to pay for my siblings, that I'm clearly not. Her friends even tell her that I might be cheating that's why I'm not moving in with her. She did get angry with them and said that if they accuse me of cheating again, she will have to take action against them but she's really having some doubts now. Her friends are texting me and harassing me too because according to them I'm ruining our and their relationship too.\n\nAITA here??\n\nNote: When my parents left my siblings, my siblings were staying at my grandparents' house for a three day vacation. I asked my grandparents if they could take care of my siblings but they are now 74 years old and they barely managed to take care of them for 3 days and they can't take care of two teenagers full time now.", "created_utc": 1681995612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sxvdj/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_has_to_accept/", "score": 790, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Odds are that won\u2019t change and you\u2019ll eventually end up footing her percentage of rent, if not other costs. The way someone handles their finances is a huge deal, especially in relationships. \n\n2) More concerning is that she has a problem with your siblings. What kind of person would want abandoned children to move out of their stable home with someone they trust and love? This is a very selfish request by her and it\u2019s a clue to her true self. \n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them. She is showing you what kind of person she is.", "NTA.\n\nShe says they will come between you and her after she moves in, but she is openly trying to come between you and them now. \n\nShe and her friends seem to live in a very different world where family responsibility is completely meaningless, so that there must be some other reason you insist on taking care of your siblings besides the fact that you care about them.", "NTA but have you talked to the police about child abandonment, or a lawyer about getting child support etc.", "NTA. You and your siblings are a package deal that can't be split. She is very selfish to think that family can be dropped that easily, like they are a rabid dog or a goldfish.", "NTA. Family comes first. However you should realize that after you and this girl break up, it will be hard for a person to not view it as you having two kids, so this might be something you need to consider if you want to have a serious relationship. Gotta express that y'all are a package deal", "NTA. Get a new gf though, you guys are not compatible. She does not accept your children. They may be your siblings, but in all actuality, they're your children now. Your relationship with her is doomed. There is no reason to have her move in when you're just going to break up down the road when she does or says terrible things to the kids to try to get them to leave.", ">My girlfriend wants to move in with me because she is having trouble paying her bills.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>I had some doubts about getting together as she always makes excuses while paying large amounts,\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>She agreed but insisted that I should leave my siblings at a relative's place as I would ask her to take care of them.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>But then she said, they will come between us\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>She \\[...\\] says I don't want to move in with her and I'm making excuses. \n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>She's calling me asshole because she thinks I'm gonna ask her to pay for my siblings, \n\nI know this sub loves to toss around the term 'gaslighting' over every little thing, but for her story to shift so much and then BLAME YOU....   wow. \n\n**It sounds like she wants to have a paycheck and fears that if your siblings are there she can't bleed you completely dry.**   \n\n>Her friends are texting me and harassing me too because according to them I'm ruining our and their relationship too.\n\nPeople like this often tell their friends distorted versions of reality, to have people on their side and to reinforce the delusion. \n\nNTA.   \n\nI know this sub loves to default into telling people to break up, but this time I would have to agree.", "NTA, she forced an ultimatum and got upset when you picked the obvious choice. It shouldn\u2019t have fallen on you to raise these kids, but you\u2019re doing an incredible thing for them. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t respect that, and it looks like your relationship has a pretty much over", "NTA. You're doing your damnedest to care for your younger siblings. And she's dated you for this whole past year knowing it. You considered letting her move in for *her* benefit. Beggars can't be choosers, and trying to get you to kick them out in favor of her is downright selfish. Stand your ground, and protect your siblings. It's obvious that they're grateful for what you do for them.", "NTA , huge respect towards you for taking care of your siblings", "NTA - you are a compassionate and decent person for taking in your brother and sister. They need you and any normal person would accept this and commend you for it. Your girlfriend, however, is not  a good person. Instead of supporting you through all of this she\u2019s jealous of your siblings and would rather see them abandoned than part of your lives. Let your girlfriend take her selfishness and ultimatums somewhere else. I know that with all the good you are putting into the world, you will find the right person for you soon.", "NTA\n\nShe's forced the issue of your siblings coming between you. She'd probably pick fights if she moved in.

In fact, I'd be thinking long and hard about whether this is the right relationship for you.  Your siblings have been through enough already, being abandoned by their own parents.  They don't need your GF treating them like unwanted additions to her own life.", "NTA\n\nYour siblings rely on you. They come first.\n\nYour girlfriend, and especially her friends, do not sound great; and I would be very hesitant to bring them any closer to your family.", "NTA  \nStaying with you is clearly the best option for you siblings.  \nYour gf and her friends need to understand that you have a certain responsibility and can't just be expected to give it up.  \nShe has to trust that you won't make her pay for the siblings, especially given that you are helping her out by allowing her to move in while she is in a tight spot.", "NTA You are their guardian. This is equivalent to her telling a single parent to get rid of their kids! Her audacity and entitlement is mindblowing!\n\nNo, you NEVER owe it to a partner to stop caring for dependents at said partner's request. You should recognize this for the huge red flag it is and break up. You'll have no trouble finding someone better.", "NTA. Awww Op you're such a great brother! Honestly I wouldn't let your gf move in. The fact that she wants you to drop your siblings just so she gets your 100% attention and I'm guessing YOUR help with HER bills is a massive AH thing of her to do. \n\nHer friends are also huge AH's because they're freaking hypocrites!  It's funny how the siblings that are basically your children at this point are \"in the way\" and \"ruining your relationship\" yet her crap friends have no problem sticking their noses into your relationship... smh", "NTA, you've take an adults responsibility and you should be praised for that. \nyou're giving your siblings a stable home, not abandoning them.\nyour gf needs to work on her priorities.. if she doesn't want play house, and be a supportive partner to you and help, she absolutely doesn't have to and should not move in.", "NTA. you and your siblings are a package deal and if she can\u2019t accept that, she shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship. relationships come with compromises and care. if you have been with your siblings to the point where you are a parental figure to them,  they aren\u2019t just an object to send away for her advantage. assuming she knew about the siblings as she started dating you, it\u2019s wrong of her to assume that you would prioritize her over blood relatives.", "NTA. Yikes. You're a good brother for sticking by your siblings' side. I don't know why your gf and her friends don't see that, but you're not wrong to tell all of them that it's family first. She can either work with that or find a guy who doesn't care about his siblings.", "NTA. Your siblings are, basically, your children now. You are their guardian. You are raising them. Is there any situation where it\u2019s acceptable to start dating someone with children and then insist that for the relationship to advance the children need to be given to someone else to raise? I don\u2019t think so. The fact that she\u2019s insisting you\u2019re using your siblings to avoid advancing your relationship while demanding that it\u2019s either her or your siblings, I think it shows the destiny of this relationship.", "NTA you are effectively the parent for your siblings now, so they are part of the package deal for your girlfriend now. I would get it if you were asking her to help pay for the children, but you specified they you're weren't. Definitely not the AH. What does she want you to do with the kids if they don't stay with you? Give them to your grandparents, who are too old to raise children, or to the foster system? Those don't sound like good options to me.", "She is correct, the kids are coming in between you two. Time to break up with her. NTA.", "NTA - but how many red flags do you need? She is twisting your words and lying to friends even before she moved in...", "NTA - First of all you are doing an amazing thing by taking care of your siblings instead of leaving them to another relative\u2019s house (which they could feel it\u2019s another abandonment from someone they love). Your Gf needs to realise that they are your priority, they are minors and have no one else. If she can\u2019t accept it, living together won\u2019t work. Also, she needs new friends because they clearly are toxic !", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend is pretty cruel that she thinks it's ok to abandon kids who have already been through trauma. Damn. \n\nYou are an amazing brother.", "NTA. You are a package deal. Rehome your GF if she doesn't understand that.", "NTA. You are doing what is necessary to keep your family together. That's really wonderful and shows how mature you are to take on this responsibility. Your girlfriend and friends are wrong here. Would any of them abandon their siblings under the same circumstance?", "NTA. Your siblings were living there first and she is the one who asked to move in because she was struggling. She is in no position to be making these stipulations. Let her know you\u2019re willing to get together and discuss boundaries prior to her moving in. But your siblings living elsewhere is non negotiable. If she won\u2019t go for this, you may need to rethink the relationship.", "NTA and probably need to consider the relationship overall. She is probably right that SOME responsibility might crop up occasionally with her as an adult living there but she needs to accept that if dating a guardian of teenagers that they will be present - sounds like you're a package deal, nothing wrong with that but she needs to decide if she's OK with that.\n\nTo be honest it sounds like the moving in is purely about the money for her rather than your relationship.", "You are raising your siblings\n\nThe sad reality is, you are not compatible with your girlfriend\n\nShe wants a single guy with no responsibilities to date\n\nThat's not you\n\nAnd now she has her friends harassing you\n\nDo the right thing and break up with her before she does something crazy like fake allegations to have the kids removed from your home\n\nNTA", "NTA.

YOu need to protect your siblings from her hostility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Dio not let her move in, you will just have to pay for one more dependent ... and she will make your sibling's lives hell.", "NTA.

Your  GF is TA btw.", "Nta. If she's unable to pay her own bills chances are she's going to mooch off of you.

She's probably doing you a favor by showing her true self.\n\nYou want to be with someone who loves you and understands your need to do the right thing while also sharing at least the willingness to take care of children who lost their parents.", "One of the clearest NTA I've seen. Your siblings rely on you, you are their guardian, you are a family unit.\n \nIn all honesty, the money issue you mentioned, should be enough to raise alarm bells, but her wanting you to dump your siblings, after they've already been abandoned by your parents, is a major red flag.\n \nDo yourself and your siblings a favour, and leave your girlfriend with some relatives!", "NTA, what an amazing brother you are!!

Even with the best intentions and extensive planning, it's going to affect anyone that dates you or wants to move in together with you.  I commend you for taking on the responsibility but hopefully you're aware that this is your life now until your brother and sister are out on their own and you are no longer their primary caretaker.\n\nThat being said, the solution should be she doesn't move in.  I don't blame her for being 24 and unprepared to live with her bf that is the defacto parent of two teenagers.

I would never offload them for anyone. We were a package deal. \n\nThe only thing I will say, is it may be naive to assume she wouldn't have any involvement with these kids. Another adult moving in, they undoubtedly will have an impact on them and in times of need will help care for them. Even just doing chores is a way of participating in their care. And it's okay for her to not want that - but that makes her incompatible with you. And that's really what it comes down to.

She will not treat your siblings well and they have to come first.  Move on.  This one is a taker.  NTA", "NTA\nGeez, who would ask their partner to abandon their under age siblings?!", "Your girlfriend is callous and cold-hearted while her friends are harassing you. If ever there was a \"dump your s/o\" reddit post, this is it. Dump her.\n\nNTA", "NTA she\u2019s giving drama llama vibes \nCan\u2019t pay her bills rn?\nDoesn\u2019t seem to like your siblings?\n\nYeah you don\u2019t need to add that to your house unless you want drama", "NTA but you might be incompatible with having a partner/GF until the sibling move out  as children at your age are a burden to a relationship.", "Absolutely NTA. Please break up with your girlfriend, she's not a keeper unfortunately.", "NTA. You have responsibilities and concerns about her ability to meet her own. She may not want to become an effective stepmother and that is her choice; but she should make it rather than try to force you to give them up so she won\u2019t have to.", "NTA\n\n\n\nBut is anyone else still stuck on paragraph one? Parents abandon everything and everyone \ud83e\udd14\nNo child services involved, no police report on missing adults? The grandparents have any concern? This all sounds off\n\n\nThe gf sounds toxic and selfish", "NTA\n\nYour siblings come first in this constellation. They are minors and have no one else.\n\nYou deserve praise for taking care of them not stupid attacks!!! \n\nIf she would truly love you, she would not mind and also be fine with it to become friends with  your siblings and support you e.g. in sharing housework or help with school - at least that would be something I would do - no questions asked ... if your siblings allow me in of course as a friend\n\nAs mentioned in an other post - you are a package deal", "She is the AH.  Plain and simple", "NTA. In all likelihood she's trying to get rid of your siblings because she wants your money covering her bills rather than being afraid that she'll have to pay more than her fair share.\n\nEven if she changed her mind about chasing your siblings away, I wouldn't trust that she won't be abusive to them behind your back to drive them out of the house,", "Top comments have nailed it. NTA\n\n1. She wants you to provide free room and board for her.\n2. She doesn't want your siblings around - NOT because she believes you will dump them on her, but BECAUSE (1) she doesn't want them infringing on her ability to enjoy the internet, space alone and (2) she doesn't want people around who could know what she does or doesn't do and lies to you about. (If there's a cheater here, it's most likely her.)\n3. She will happily use that you could afford to pay for two siblings as her reasoning that you should cover her. She will never fully pay her share.\n\nThank her for helping you see who she is so clearly and then tell her goodbye.\n\nBTW - You are quite an impressive and loving sibling. Your siblings are lucky to have you in their lives. Lots of good wishes for all three of you.", "NTA! You\u2019re a great man keep it up!! THIS IS THE WAY", "NTA\n\nGood for you! You stepped up to take care of your siblings.  A lot of people would rather their siblings be thrown into foster care. You are making it work, even though its hard. You are a good brother.\n\nYour girlfriend is selfish. She has no right to displace them from their home. I don't see this relationship going anywhere.", "YTA if you let her move in.\n\nYou already have concerns about her paying her share of the rent, she's already shown that she is unable to keep up with your bills. \n\nYou aren't on the same page regarding your siblings. Your siblings should come first and if she isn't keen on living with them from the beginning then I don't  see how there can be any continued happiness should she move in. Either your siblings are going to be ignored or mistreated or your gf will be miserable, and that can be bad for you and your family.\n\nNow there's a chance that you can work through these things but I would be very wary.", "NTA", "Nta she's the one trying to cause a wedge between you and your siblings. Moving in with her will be a big mistake. She has problems paying all her bills. So it seems like she's hoping you will pay them. On top of that she is telling her friends your business and are harassing you. Your gf is a huge AH for trying to get you to abandon your siblings. Your better off without her.", "This is not the woman for you.\n\nYou have made a commitment to care for your siblings. She wants to move in to save on her costs but wants to kick them out. Charming. Then gets her friends to harass you - never a good look in an argument. This will simply not work.\n\nNTA", "NTA and DO NOT let her move in. \n\nTaking care of your siblings like you are is a fucking awesome thing to do, but she\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t want that. That means she will probably make them uncomfortable in their own home and basically run them off. She\u2019ll essentially be an evil fianc\u00e9 (like all the evil stepmothers in films) and neither you nor your siblings deserve that. \n\nAlso, she ain\u2019t gonna pay bills, she\u2019s gonna stiff you every month", "NTA\nI would not want your gf to move in with her financial history and her attitude toward your siblings. The fact that she has gone to her friends and dragged them in is also very immature.  I think you can get a new girlfriend and keep your siblings close.", "NTA  What you\u2019re doing for your siblings is incredibly admirable and generous. Anyone who sees it differently, is not good enough for you.  It also sounds like her and her friends bring unnecessary drama to your life.  You don\u2019t need that kind of obstacle.", "NTA and please don't let her move in. She clearly has a problem with your siblings, who were literally dumped by your parents. They are practically orphans and rely on you. As long as you are okay with this, that's all that matters. Don't let this chick ruin your family.", "NTA: Girlfriend is a major A H and is being manipulative and toxic. OP needs to lose this girlfriend.", "NTA \n\nAnd there are many many red flags \n\nYou are a man if honor for taking care of your siblings", "Nta by a mile.\n\nThe fact that she wants you to kick your MINOR siblings out? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA you and your siblings are a package deal. Both your parents and girlfriend are the asshole here.", "NTA. Do not let her move in and you need to reconsider your entire relationship.  She wants you to abandon your siblings so you can take care of her, she's told you as much.  She wants to rob your siblings of their home with a person they love and trust and her actions are absolutely vile.", "I\u2019ve huge respect for you.  You\u2019re a good and true person who deserved a partner who shares your sensibility to ensure your siblings are taken care of. \n\nYou deserve better and trust that it will come if you aren\u2019t being constrained by the relationship which is at odds with your goal of being a good man. \n\nKick her out and find a way.", "NTA \n\nFirst off, good on you for stepping up and taking care of your siblings. They\u2019re kids and your parents definitely suck. \n\nYour girlfriend sounds like a wicked stepmother in a Grimm fairytale. I\u2019m sorry my guy but you need to make it clear that these kids come first, and her friends are just stirring up a lot of drama for no reason.", "Read your own post-my girlfriend wants to move in with me because she is having trouble paying her bills.   You have enough on your plate!!  Do NOT take on responsibilities for your girlfriend!!!", "NTA, but your GF is not going to accept your siblings living there. I think your relationship just ended.", "OP, she\u2019s not the one.", "NTA\n\nNot by a longshot.\n\nI'm sorry your gf has put you in a \"choose me or them\" position. Good on you for looking out for family, I hope she comes around and sees how much you value your family.", "Warning sign #3: She gets her friends to brigade you with texts when you make a decision that she doesn't like.", "Let's be honest, a lot of Reddit and even this sub seems to live in that world too.", "Agree , NTA op find another gf this one is toxic for your family.", "I would be pissed if I dated a guy in this situation and he wanted to get rid of the kids. OP, based on what you\u2019ve said here, you\u2019re an awesome guy who cares about his family. There are plenty of women out there who would love to have a partner who is kind, steps up in an emergency, and is family-oriented, but your gf isn\u2019t one of those women. Dump her and her weird, toxic friends who are interfering where they shouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re NAH, but your gf sure is.", "I'm wondering if there are any social services or benefit programs that may help OP financially too.", "And once she's living there it might be quite difficult to evict *her* should be messy and freeloading.", "It seems almost like she knows he can care for her financials bc he\u2019s done it for his siblings so she\u2019s just trying to set herself up.", "NTA. You are much more mature than this GF, and your post is full of warnings about her.\n\nThe ideas above are excellent. You could also ask your grandparents for financial help. They might also help with finding your parents - they should be forced to support your siblings financially.", "You are an amazing big brother! Your siblings are lucky and blessed to have you around.", "Whoever said that, clearly has never raised a teenager.", "You're such a great sibling!", "And lets be honest, even if he did evict his siblings, his grandparents are 74 and almost certainly living off of a fixed income (social security/retirement savings/pension/etc) that didn't factor in raising teenagers so those kids would still be financially dependent on OP even if he did relocate them to his grandparents.", "But it's not easy, particularly if you have a conscience. Which is the point.", "I mean, again, that is the conscientious decision though. Yeah it sucks, but that's an easy decision to make because dying from rabies is not pretty or pleasant."]}
