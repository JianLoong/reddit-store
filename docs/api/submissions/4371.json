Ever since she moved in at 18, she has been extremely inconsiderate when in her bedroom. My husband and I share the master bedroom and her room is next to ours. We share a wall. All night, I wake up to her plugging things into the outlet on the wall, moving around in her room, and opening her door to go to the bathroom. Her door does not fit in the frame correctly, so this is especially noisy. It bangs every time she opens it. Sometimes, she will even sneak down the stairs to the kitchen or basement because she wants to \"talk to her friends\"... even though it's well past midnight.\n\nA few months ago, she wanted her bed against the wall. I said no. I think it looks tacky and bad when people do that, plus it's a fire hazard and completely unnecessary. She still did it and the sounds of her sleeping and typing on her computer all night kept me up, so I returned her bed to its original position and told her to not move it again and for god's sake, be quieter at night.\n\nShe was not. The plugging things into the outlet is the worst of it. Numerous times in the last month has this woken me up, over and over. She claims that she needs to be able to take her phone cord out and plug it in every day, but she could just as easily do that when I'm awake. She does not. \n\nFinally, I had enough. I gave her one final warning. A day later, her plugging something into the outlet woke me up and I lost it. I told her that she was switching rooms with my son (10M), her brother. She was very upset about this, since that room is much smaller and does not have as big of a closet, so she would have to get rid of some of her books and her sewing table. I told her that this was the consequences of her actions and that if she just followed directions, this wouldn't be happening. Plus, now she could plug and unplug things all night long if she wanted to.\n\nWe swapped the rooms and she settled, or so I thought. Last night, I heard something heavy fall and it woke me up, so I burst into her room demanding to know what she was doing to cause so much noise. She looked red-faced and guilty and said that she'd just knocked a couple books off her desk and it shouldn't bother me so much since she's at the other end of the hall now. I lost my cool a little bit and yelled at her, but that's what people do when they're sleep deprived. She shouldn't even be up that late anyways when she is in college and working. I might've implied that she'd lose the privilege of closing her door if she didn't get her act in order, but I am so sick of being woken up in the middle of the night with her noises. \n\nShe says I'm an AH for this and claims that she's not even making that much noise. I disagree, since I'm the one being woken up.

How is she supposed to be silent while unconscious?", "YTA - based on the title I thought this would be clear. But let me get this straight, your stepdaughter is:\n\n- using an electrical outlet \n- walking \n- opening a door\n\nAND THEN when she wants to talk on the phone she goes to another part of the house, so being considerste. Really lobbying for that wicked step mother title arent ya? \n\nYeah, youre a huge AH.", "YTA. Wear earplugs maybe?", "YTA. fix the door, and buy a white noise machine.

She's a college student, of course she's up late at night working!\n\nThe threat to take the door off of her room is the worst offense. You want to hear less of her, but you think having no door will help? She's a human being and deserves privacy. \n\nIf you don't want her living with you just own up to it and give her a few months notice to find somewhere else to live. Stop making it out to be a 'her' problem when 99% of humans would find it unbearable to live at the noise level of an ant.", "YTA. You sound like an overbearing stepmother because she\u2019s not trying to be loud! Put some earplugs in your ears at night or invest in a noise machine to help with the noise level! Also, if her door frame is messed up you should fix it! Punishing her like this isn\u2019t going to make her like you lol", "Ok, so not hearing her side I'm going to go ahead and say you're the AH. You made her change rooms because she's plugging things into her wall outlets? You're mad she has to go to the bathroom because her door doesn't fit the frame (which unless she built the house isn't her fault) and she's even considerate enough to go downstairs to make phone calls to try not to bother you and that bothers you. If your walls are that thin that seems like more of a structural problem then a her problem. You're even threatening a 21 year old woman with losing the PRIVILEGE (what, are you kidding me?) of having a door when she has a 10 year old brother running around? How is she going to change? How is not having a door going to make things quieter when the sound of her breathing pisses you off with her door closed. Honestly it sounds like you hate your stepdaughter and you're finding any excuse to make her uncomfortable so she moves out. Get a white noise machine or some noise cancelling headphones and look into therapy to figure out what it is that makes you so petty you're taking out all of your frustrations on your husband's daughter because it's easier than dealing with your real problems and stop being the bane of this poor girl's existence when she's just trying to work and go to school and still have some kind of a life. Just wow.", "YTA. The title makes it sounds like she\u2019s playing bagpipes all night or something.

Holy hell, your fury at fact someone is merely existing while you're sleeping is completely unreasonable.

It sounds like the problem isn't with her habits, but with your own noise oversensitivety. Get earplugs. The amount of judgement from you is astounding. How is having a bed against a wall tacky?

Stop living up to the Disney trope, you're giving stepparent a bad name.\n\nThink it's clear you don't like your stepdaughter, don't want her living with you, and only suffer her presence because your husband won't react well if you didn't allow her to live with you.", "YTA and if this is real, you have some serious issues. \n\nIn your own words, the listed unacceptable activities of your _adult 21y/o_ stepdaughter include:\n\n\n- not going to sleep on YOUR schedule.\n\n\n- using electricity. (Via wall outlets- probably alternating plugging in her laptop charger & phone charger. Did you consider helping yourself out by getting her a power strip so she had plenty of outlets? _Of course not._)\n\n\n- going to the bathroom.

What next - forcing her to get a catheter so she doesn't use the bathroom?\n\nShe's just living a very ordinary and polite life.  Everything you describe are very ordinary, not loud life sounds.

Ever since she moved in at 18, she has been extremely inconsiderate when in her bedroom. My husband and I share the master bedroom and her room is next to ours. We share a wall. All night, I wake up to her plugging things into the outlet on the wall, moving around in her room, and opening her door to go to the bathroom. Her door does not fit in the frame correctly, so this is especially noisy. It bangs every time she opens it. Sometimes, she will even sneak down the stairs to the kitchen or basement because she wants to \"talk to her friends\"... even though it's well past midnight.\n\nA few months ago, she wanted her bed against the wall. I said no. I think it looks tacky and bad when people do that, plus it's a fire hazard and completely unnecessary. She still did it and the sounds of her sleeping and typing on her computer all night kept me up, so I returned her bed to its original position and told her to not move it again and for god's sake, be quieter at night.\n\nShe was not. The plugging things into the outlet is the worst of it. Numerous times in the last month has this woken me up, over and over. She claims that she needs to be able to take her phone cord out and plug it in every day, but she could just as easily do that when I'm awake. She does not. \n\nFinally, I had enough. I gave her one final warning. A day later, her plugging something into the outlet woke me up and I lost it. I told her that she was switching rooms with my son (10M), her brother. She was very upset about this, since that room is much smaller and does not have as big of a closet, so she would have to get rid of some of her books and her sewing table. I told her that this was the consequences of her actions and that if she just followed directions, this wouldn't be happening. Plus, now she could plug and unplug things all night long if she wanted to.\n\nWe swapped the rooms and she settled, or so I thought. Last night, I heard something heavy fall and it woke me up, so I burst into her room demanding to know what she was doing to cause so much noise. She looked red-faced and guilty and said that she'd just knocked a couple books off her desk and it shouldn't bother me so much since she's at the other end of the hall now. I lost my cool a little bit and yelled at her, but that's what people do when they're sleep deprived. She shouldn't even be up that late anyways when she is in college and working. I might've implied that she'd lose the privilege of closing her door if she didn't get her act in order, but I am so sick of being woken up in the middle of the night with her noises. \n\nShe says I'm an AH for this and claims that she's not even making that much noise. I disagree, since I'm the one being woken up. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
