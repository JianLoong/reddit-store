I finally just turn and say will you shut the fuck up? She definitely hated that, started bitching, but you could tell everyone else was sighing relief someone called her out.", "NTA. She is not a toddler, she should know what indoor voice is.", "NTA.  If you heard details of a conversation from two rows away and earplugs in, they were way too loud.  However, it probably would have been a good idea to get a flight attendant involved to try to get them to STFU.", "NTA.

Always travel with noise-canceling headphones especially if you are sensitive to loud people.", "NTA - but what happened at franks wedding?", "NTA,\n Listing back to them their topics of conversation is gold. Well done.", "NTA, you are the GOAT.", "NTA. They disturbed you with their behaviour and you called them out on it.

Or else complain to the hostess so they can do something about that. Hate that kind of people", "NTA. I\u2019ve gone up and asked people to put headphones in multiple times and they usually want to fight me. You\u2019re a hero", "NTA. You did the Lord\u2019s work right there.

It is like 11pm now and my husband told her to take a hint and shut up. She was offended and looked to the guy for backup but he just looked away. Never been happier with silence in my life.", "NTA, they immediately got defensive which should tell you all you need to know.", "No.\n\nThey are.

It was a public service announcement.", "NTA.\nThey're rude, entitled and selfish. To talk that loud and know you're surrounded by other travelers who are going through a variety of different things and emotions is so selfish. Sorry not sorry she got her selfishness called out. More people need to point out bad behavior. Thank you. I was in a movie theater one time and a woman brought in her very young child and baby and they proceeded to cry, yell and have tantrums. A worker came in after complaints were made and asked her to take the children out of the theater. She started loudly protesting (all while the movie is playing) saying what was she was supposed to do. A gentleman (the theater's hero) finally shouted \"take your damn kids out of here so we can enjoy the movie\" and everyone clearly agreed and started to voice the same sentiment. She called us as a*holes and stormed out. I went to be that man one day. He's the real MVP", "LOL. NTA", "NTA you are a local hero", "Hell no! NTA! My hero! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.

It's good that you did it.", "If they think they are not talking loud they should really get their hearing checked", "NTA - Plenty of people telling quiet people that they\u2019re too quiet. We need more people telling the loud people that they\u2019re too loud.", "My mom does this when she wants to be the center of attention. She\u2019s also a narcissist so\u2026. Totally NTA! I love that you had the courage to say something.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you say anything *during* the flight?", "NTA, you did a nobel thing and even listed their topics of conversation to shut them up.

Godspeed noble asshole.", "YTA but sometimes you need to be an asshole to save others from even bigger assholes. So good job.", "everyone else around you wanted to say it but they were too chicken.

Too bad she didn't handle it well.", "INFO: did you actually say anything to them or is this just how you imagined the confrontation would go?", "No, some people think that others want to hear their conversation, But we don\u2019t", "NTA some people have no volume control...it's usually a sign of bad upbringing", "NTA", "YTA\n\nHow do you mention franks wedding and not give us details?!", "NTA assuming those were your exact words because you weren't rude about it. IMO I would have only spoken up if they were using profanity while they were talking. Were they? If so, I might have alerted a flight attendant instead of going to them directly.", "Info: Why didn't you ask her to keep her voice down earlier in the flight? As a person with a loud voice myself, I sometimes don't realize I'm too noisy. Why wait to ask her to lower her voice?", "ESH. If it was such a bother, then perhaps you should have mentioned something earlier. It was definitely a bit confrontational to get up walk to them while they're sitting and tell them to shut up. You probably could have been more tactful. \n\nThey're definitely assholes. Air travel brings out the worst in a lot of people", "NTA for calling them out but YTA for putting an H at the end of AITA", "ESH: I know I am going to get hate for this judgment, but hear me out. Yes, the loud people were AH, no qualms about calling that out. So why is OP an AH? Because they 1, stuck their nose in someone else's business and 2, they felt it was bad enough to speak up but not to ask a flight attendant to intervene during the flight when it would have made a difference.  \nThat said, they were an AH for a good reason. They stepped in to be the AH to spare the other person who had to share another flight with them. While they deserve thanks for the service, and it is a bit of a mitzvah, it doesn't make what they did suddenly not an AH move. Escalating by being AH's against AH's makes for twice the AH in the world and may even serve to reinforce the originating AH's behavior.", "YTA - Your flight with them was over. Their behavior was no longer relevant to you. If it bothered you during the flight, you could have aske a flight attendant to speak to them. Which is what the other people could have done if they were on another flight together. You started an unnecessary confrontation. You calling them out at the end of a flight when you were never going to see them again was completely pointless. It will in no way change their behavior. \n\nAlso, I refuse to believe anyone looked \"terrified\" about sitting near someone who is loud.", "Oh what the hell this story is probably fake but just incase it aint.. YTA for trying to play hero in someone else's predicament. They were on the other ladies next flight not yours. If you didn't have the nerve to say anything during your flight you don't need to speak up now.", "If it bothered you, why didn't you say something to them during the flight when they could have corrected the behavior? Passive aggressively telling them after the flight only serves to shame them and dig further into the bad behavior.", "i mean YTA but like jury nullification i wouldn\u2019t find you guilty", "Does anyone know how to go internal? We live in A very loud society. Idgaf about your cheap orange earplugs. \n\nI also- dgaf about loud people. When did we all get so concerned about others? \n\nLive. Let live.

And had to hear about his wedding WITH EARPLUGS IN AND 2 SEATS AHEAD. Absolutely insane", "NTA. There is something called flight etiquette, which these people need to learn. If the people in your whole row heard them, with another person feeling terrified, then that already tells the woman how loud she was.", "NTA. Always bring noise cancelling headphones on planes", "So what DID happen at Frank\u2019s wedding? \n\nNTA- far from it in fact.", "NTA - Way to go. There is another angle to it, I read that people who are a bit hard of hearing tend to speak louder as they cannot hear themselves speak - maybe that could be the case.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO\n  \nWhat happened at Frank's Wedding?", "As others have clearly stated, no, you aren't the asshole.\n\nI get people not liking confrontation. But seeing posts where people stick their gross Shrek looking feet up on armrests from a row behind or playing shit from their phones beside you are incredibly disrespectful and deserves to be called out. \n\nI do my best to be as quiet and courteous to those around me and expect others to do the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA - Seriously professional move to recap their conversation for them.

Thank you for standing up to these people!!", "NTA  \nThe details on their story were the best part of it.", "NTA. You said it politely and if you could hear the details of their conversation that clearly from 2 rows back even without earplugs in they were being too loud. \n\nTheir reaction was childish, I'm not a loud talker but if I was and someone calmly asked me to keep the noise down I'd apologise and make more effort to be quiet like any decent human being. \n\nSome people are naturally loud talkers like my partner so they may not have been doing it intentionally but yeah, after being informed of it they should try harder to tone it down and be considerate of everyone else.", "NTA. My husband comes from a family where several of them are hard of hearing. Some of them speak louder than normal. My husband went the other way and speaks very quietly, even though his hearing is bad. He says he\u2019s not going to yell over others since no one would hear him anyway. People who grow up around loud people generally don\u2019t realize how loud they are to the rest of us.", "NTA. Good on you for saying something.", "NTA you\u2019re my hero", "NTA They were probably in performance mode. They think they are the center of the world and everyone wants to listen.", "NTA \n\nThis reminds me of the time I had to take a five hour Amtrak to New Haven across the aisle from four women drinking white claws out of their travel coffee mugs (I watched the refills) and gossiping loudly the entire time.", "NTA\n\ni am a person that speaks loudly when excited and i can only say \"sorry, i didn't realize\" and try to adapt my voice to something less annoying for others lol also you earn points in my book because the sarcastic delivery was excellent", "NTA at all. These kinds of people thrive on being assholes and disturbing others, I wish more people called them out like you did!", "NTA some people just don't have an inside voice or any self-awareness. I've done the same anytime somebody says they weren't talking too loud I list off everything I heard about their conversation, it usually shuts them up.", "NTA. God bless you, citizen!", "NTA - someone never learned about inside voices or whispering.", "NTA.\n\nNothing left to say. If you're on public transport show some courtesy towards others.\n\nAnd it's totally OK to point out if they don't, otherwise they (as you can see) aren't even aware of being rude.", "NTA.  I would have let the flight attendant handle it though.", "NTA. But damn that's gonna be a funny story when you marry her.", "NTA.  People need to relearn how to behave in public post Covid and be respectful of other people sharing the same space.", "Some people don't know how loud they are and need to be told. Absolutely NTA!

I think he talks loud to hear via vibrating his skull.", "NTA\n\nI get that some people might be obvious to how loud they are. Being told not to scream isn't an asshole move. The fact that the pair doesn't seem to think that there is anything wrong with screaming and bothering everyone is an issue and bad manners.", "NTA - thank you for doin\u2019 the Lawd\u2019s work.", "What was their reply after you called em out", "nah, some people are really oblivious. you maybe saved some future passengers a little grief.", "NTA.

You are a hero!", "NTA. Some people are totally unaware that they shout everything they say.", "Totally NTA", "NTA. Is it really that hard to just say \"sorry, we didn't realize we were talking loudly\".

I told them it had to stop and it actually did. It wouldn't have been very effective and sort of just awkward if I complained to her after the flight landed.", "NTA.

Will they last?", "NTA - I wish more people would stand up to loud and annoying people. I wish I would have said something to the guy sitting two rows back during my last flight.

My hero!!!", "Nta, people need to be more considerate of the fact being stuck in a metal tube thousands upon thousands of feet in the air is not the place to talk loud, *especially* about fucking Frank and his wedding.

Some people have no self-awareness. Good for you for calling them out!!", "NTA. They could be Hard of Hearing, but really if you could hear them with earplugs that far ahead on a plane, they need to find another way to communicate during the flight, or at least take breaks. \n\nMy partner doesn't find their hearing aids comfortable, so I don't talk to them into their good ear in close quarters with strangers, but I also ask them to wear them when I know they will need to hear something important.
