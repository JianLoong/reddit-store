I and Jay have been together for a year and a half now, and he is the most amazing man in the world. He's been amazing with my son (his bio father is not in his life) and I can genuinely see him as \"the one\". Jay's parents came over as well. It's not that I don't get along with them, it's just I have only ever seen them 3 times before this thanksgiving. I have not had any time to really bond with them I guess. They had never met my son in person either, but they both knew about him.\n\nBy the time I arrived Jay's parents were already there and helping him finish up dinner. We greeted each other and Jay's dad asked \"And who's this little guy.\" I introduced them to my son and then introduced Jay's parents as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" to my precious boy. I didn't notice at the time, but all three of them became quiet almost immediately. I ended up waiting in the living room alone for almost half an hour before dinner and things just were incredibly awkward for the rest of the night. My son did end up calling his parents by grandpa and grandma and I quickly noticed both of them would be very disingenuous and awkward about it over dinner but they did not say anything to me about it. They didn't stick around for long after either but when they left both were very cold to me. \n\nI asked Jay what was their deal and he lost it at me. He claims I put him in an incredibly awkward position. His parents apparently didn't think we were \"That serious\" yet and began to question him if I was only using him as a \"replacement daddy.\" He said that it was way out of line to introduce them that way without even talking to him beforehand. I think it's ridiculous. If one day he's going to be my son's stepdad then why go through this formal nonsense? He claimed that's \"Not the point\" and we ended up fighting till I stormed out. \n\nWe have not talked since and I have simply been waiting for an apology. I talked with my sister about it last night and she said she was mortified to hear this. Saying she also didn't geat the read that we were all that serious and she never felt like Jay intended to take on a \"Dad\" role.

YOU are the AH here. It is YOU who needs to apologize!", "YTA- that\u2019s moving way too fast. You need to discuss that with your boyfriend and his family first, you\u2019re just setting everyone, including your son, up for failure here. You guys have only been dating a year and a half and he hasn\u2019t even proposed yet. Have you maybe thought that, because of his reaction and the fact that his family didn\u2019t think you were serious, your boyfriend may not be in the same place as you are? It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s as serious about your future as you believe that he is and you\u2019ve now created a whole fictitious family that your son is set up to lose. Pump the breaks a little here.", "YTA - You owe his parents and him an apology and you have a conversation to be having with your kid. 18 months is nothing. Unless you\u2019re living together and married (committed to a parenting role) then you have no place to assign grandparent names to your BOYFRIEND\u2019S parents. Boyfriend - not husband. In fact\u2026 I\u2019d go so far as saying you and your boyfriend seem to be in different relationships. He is absolutely nowhere near that level of commitment and blending families. You need take a step back and check yourself.", "You need to apologize to literally everyone else involved. Your child, your bf, and his parents. \n\nYou made things incredibly uncomfortable and awkward because you jumped the gun. It\u2019s not your sole decision to make, the other adults should have a say. Just because you\u2019ve been together and Jay is good w/ the child does not mean he\u2019s now his father or that his parents are ready or comfortable to be called grandma/pa. \n\nYou made a big decision for everyone else without consulting or thinking \n\nYTA", "YTA. There should have been a conversation between you and Jay (or between you and Jay\u2019s parents) about what your son should call his parents. If logistics prevented that talk from happening, then the intro should have been, \u201cSon, this is Jay\u2019s mom and dad\u201d, then they take the lead and they can tell him he should call them Mr & Mrs Smith or Mr Bob and Miss Barb. It\u2019s a real disservice to your son to introduce him to \u201cgrandparents\u201d that he may never see again. I understand your optimism about where this relationship with Jay is headed, but without you and Jay having made any formal plans for the future, you need to tread very lightly when it comes to your son.", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a discussion you need to have with your partner beforehand.", "YTA not just for making it awkward for Jay and his family, but now your kid thinks of them as gramma and grampa...and they might not be. In fact, judging by Jay's reaction, yeah, he hasn't even entertained the idea of marriage to you (and you might have just torpedoed that entirely).  You're going to break your kid's heart.  \n\nYou should have honestly asked his parents how they want to be referred to by your son--it's their son's girlfriend's kid so it's not an unusual question.  It's great to fantasize about a future with a partner, but don't drag your kid into the fantasy. \n\nAnd now you're 'waiting for an apology'. Oh honey.", "YTA and completely oblivious to social norms. You don\u2019t call your boyfriend\u2019s parents grandma and grandpa to your child without at least asking them if they\u2019re ok with those titles first. Especially if they haven\u2019t met the child yet. You also don\u2019t do this unless you\u2019re sure this relationship is going to end in marriage or a very long term partnership. You\u2019ve now confused your child and put your boyfriend\u2019s parents in a very awkward position.", "YTA  \n\n\n  \nYou should totally had have that conversation beforehand with your boyfriend. Doesn't matter that you see him as the one, doesn't matter you have been together for a year and a half, doesn't matter you two are serious about your relationship, because that move from you didn't only impact your bf, but other people (his parents) who didn't ask or choose to be in your life, even less in your son's life.\n\nEven if you end up marrying your gf, you can't impose on his parents to be grand-parents to your son if they don't want it.", "Yikes. YTA. You\u2019ve met these people 3 times. You and their son are not married, not even engaged. \n\nSeems like the two of you are nowhere near on the same page about your relationship. Instead of waiting for an apology\u2026you should probably be preparing for the single life", "YTA You sprung that on people you barely know. That's a lot. You talk these things through with all parties involved. That's not cool to your son, his parents or your bf.", "YTA, it\u2019s been 18 months.", "YTA . Please let the kid decide when and who to give titles to. You should have introduced them as \"Jay's mom and dad (names)\" if eventually they get close enough then switch to grandma. Just like if he wants to call a boyfriend dad, that is his and the other person's choice, not yours. This is super creepy being the 1st time they've met.  building these relationships can take years. Be patient and be careful. The only thing that hurts worse than be abandoned by one dad is being abandoned by another and another. Please be more careful with your son's heart in the future.", "YTA - extremely out of line, and I'm sure, he will not be sthe stepdaddy", "YTA.  You\u2019re going to really screw up your kid by doing things like this.  They didn\u2019t ask for the role, you\u2019re not married, and they don\u2019t know your kid.  Don\u2019t force kids on people and give them inaccurate titles.  Once you\u2019re married, you can discuss this with them.  Either way, the appropriate thing would have been to have a discussion on using \u201cMr./Mrs. X\u201d or their first names.  Just because you chose poorly with bio dad does not give you license to make up roles for anyone your son comes into contact with.", "YTA. You are only dating and barely met his family. You aren\u2019t engaged or married. You should have talked with him first, but this should not have happened. Just because you see him as \u201cthe one\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it will work out or that you will get married. \n\nYou foisted this on his parents without any conversation with his family and absolutely put him in an awkward situation.\n\nYou owe him and his parents a major apology.", "YTA\n\nEven if you and Jay were **married**, it would still be customary for his parents to have input on whether they are grandparents to your child. \n\nSince you are **only** dating Jay and didn\u2019t consult his parents, you hugely overstepped. You also didn\u2019t bother to consult with Jay. You are merely dating - not married, not even engaged. \n\nSo, even though you believe he is \u201cthe one,\u201d Jay still gets to make decisions about his own life.\n\nYou had a fight and now you\u2019re waiting on his apology. Why? Is this a pattern? Do you fight and then he always gives in and apologizes? Because I cannot see any other reason for you to expect an apology when you are so completely in the wrong. \n\nIf - after reading all these comments - you still don\u2019t get that what you did was wrong, then look into getting some professional help.\n\nLast but far from least, the real victim of your behavior is your son. Your relationship with Jay may not now last. You\u2019ve alienated his parents and possibly pushed Jay too far. Don\u2019t let this be a pattern - bringing people and families into your son\u2019s life prematurely. As a parent, you should work to make his life as stable as possible. Right now, you\u2019ve introduced him to \u201c*grandparents*\u201d he may never see again. Learn from this and protect your son.", "Oh dear. How very awkward for everyone involved.", "YTA- That\u2019s really jumping the gun. They have never even met your child and you are having them called grandma and grandpa? You were definitely out of line.", "YTA. Not only to your BF and parents (who were really sweet not to make a fuss in front of your son), but to your kid too. Suddenly he has grandparents!! What happens if you break up and they just\u2026 disappear? Heartbreaking.", "YTA\nDear, your boyfriend did not express his wish to be the childs father, he is still dating you and seeing where this is going. Maybe someday he would think he is the father. But what you did was disrespectful, you forced the decision without his consent. You made the grandparents who never even met the child and know nothing feel like their son was hiding things from them or that you are forcing their son. It's not a good situation, say your sorry and see if the relationship is atill salvageble", "YTA you seem to be pushing a family who JUST MET YOUR CHILD for the first time on him. You\u2019re an AH to Jay\u2019s parents and to your son. You don\u2019t do this to a child because it\u2019s confusing. And you certainly don\u2019t do this when you haven\u2019t talked to the people involved about what kind of relationship they WANT with your child. Like what in the world\n\nEdit-and you\u2019ve only met the parents 3x. Even bigger AH cause YOU don\u2019t even have that relationship with them", "YTA. That was highly inappropriate and probably super confusing to your little guy.", "YTA. I was so uncomfortable reading this, I cannot imagine living it. \nDeciding someone is going to take on a parent or grandparent role is something that needs to be heavily discussed before and ensure that everyone is on the same page. You don\u2019t spring that on someone, especially in front of your son! I give your bfs parents a ton of credit for not stopping the conversation right then and there.", "YTA\n\nYou are treating him as a replacement daddy, and you got upset when he called you out on your b*llsh!t. \n\nHopefully he leaves you, he deserves better.", "Let me get this straight.\n1) you\u2019ve been dating Jay for a year and a half.\n2) you\u2019ve only met Jay\u2019s parents three times and this is the first time they\u2019ve met your son\n3) you introduced people your son has never met as his grandparents\n4) YOU are waiting on an apology because YOU blindsided everyone with this proclamation. \n\nYeah YTA and I\u2019m really not sure why you think everyone else is. \n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "YTA. You don't get to decide that they are your son's grandparents. Even your bf doesn't get to decide that, but it sounds like he's not ready to be dad, either. And you don't even live together! You put everyone in an awkward position, so of course they were all uncomfortable. It sounds like you're trying to push a relationship that isn't there yet.", "YTA. That was wildly inappropriate not only for your BF and his parents but for your son as well.", "Sorry OP but YTA. \n\nYou should have had this discussion with your bf first. If he agreed, then talk to your son together with your bf. Your bf would have then given his parents the heads up. \n\nInstead, everyone was blindsided and of course it made things awkward. \n\nHave you even had a convo with your bf on how serious you both feel the relationship is going and where it may be headed?", "YTA you are mad because your Go.lddi.gger Tricks not Work.\nI hope he run. This was definitely not the first Red Flag you did.", "YTA. You created an expectation on your bf parents to play a grandparent role without checking with them that they wanted to do that first. Furthermore, your partner may not have discussed with them his plans for his future with you as yet. If you have discussed getting married and they are going to be step grandparents it would have been nicer to let bf be the one to talk to them.", "YTA. Holy boundary issues Batman. Stop screwing with your kid's sense of family and security. Some parents don't introduce their kids to partners for months or years to prevent the type of confusion you chose to create.", "The formal nonsense you talk about is called communication. I don't think I'd even be comfortable introducing my young child to a boyfriend until at least 6 months- year into a relationship. And if I did so it would be after numerous serious conversation about expectations and boundaries. Children become attached really easily and it's up to you as his mother to ensure he doesn't get hurt or emotionally damaged by the people you bring into his life. I'm not even going to vote because I think you realize how wrong this was. But I would honestly think deeply about how it would effect your son if this relationship was to end.", "INFO Did you also call them Mom and Dad?", "YTA. They aren\u2019t his grandparents, and you had no right to foist that title on them.", "YTA. That's a major leap to introduce them with those terms when they don't fulfill that role. And the fact that he may one day be stepdad doesn't mean he's Dad unless you had a serious discussion about if he will take on that role.", "YTA.  You should habe cleared that with your boyfriend and his parents first. I also think you need to end the relationship if everyones saying its not that serious and youre 'hes your new daddy' serious. Big incompatibility there.", "YTA\nYou need to slow your roll", "I feel really bad for you cause you remind me of my mom. But don\u2019t push your kid on to people because it looks right in your head. I always resented how my mom pushed her bfs to be my dad and their family to be mine. Luckily my stepdad and his family get along with me and vice versa but this was very insensitive of you. Also you could really end up confusing and isolating your son when/if you guys break up. \nYTA but I get that you just want love and love for your son you\u2019re going about it the wrong way though. Take a deep breathe and apologize to Jay and his parents. Sit down with your son and say you made a mistake. Jay\u2019s parents are his parents and we will ask them what you should call them.", "YTA", "YTA ~ unless his parents indicate otherwise, they should be introduced to your son as mr. & mrs. whatever.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to declare and introduce his parents as grandparents to your kid without their consent and permission especially to a kid they\u2019ve never met. You made a lot of assumptions without communicating any of it with your partner.", "YWBTA if you don\u2019t call everyone and apologize. I would say you didn\u2019t think things through and reacted on the spot, and you are very sorry and did not mean to confuse everyone. If YOU are confused, though, then that is a much bigger relationship discussion. He is 25 and may not be in the same place as you, you may want to know that at this point.", "... you're kidding right?\n\nYTA", "If someone made me their kid\u2019s new grandma the first time I met them I would be extremely uncomfortable and probably never want to meet them ever again.", "YTA\n\nWow, that\u2019s stuff to talk about beforehand!\nAnd then it might still take time, until his parents decide for themselves what your son may call them at one point in your relationship!\n\nPlease, take a quiet moment for yourself, and truly truly dig into the idea, if you took your BF and his parents basically hostage, with your sons being a gun held to their breasts. How on earth can you confuse your own child like that. I\u2019m stunned tbh. \n\nHowever, a little \u201cwow\u201d goes out to his parents for finding daggers for words so quickly about your relationship. That also kinda stings.

So much second hand embarrassment right now.", "YTA. You are trying to force a relationship that isn't there... \n I am literally the boyfriend's parents in this situation. A little different in that my son is dating his high school girlfriend again after she just got divorced. She has 2 kids. We have always been close with this girls family so her children know me and I have babysat for them multiple times. She asked me what I want the girls to call me... Grandma and nana are taken....I said I was fine with them calling me aunt as they always have... Grandma is a very special name and I haven't earned that.

You sound like a girl that I knew who would get her daughter to call her new boyfriends dad after like date 2. \n\nThe fact that everyone else in this (besides your son) had no idea that you guys were this serious means that you\u2019ve been just assuming and pushing your feelings for a long time.

Wow that\u2019s some bad parenting, as well as bad social etiquette.\n\nYou tried to force a relationship on these people, who have never even met your kid.

Your poor son. What will he think if these people are not in his life going forward?", "YTA, you should discuss stuff like that with your partner, especially when it involves his family. Could also be super confusing/painful for the child if \"grandma and grandpa\" are out of the picture or cold towards him.", "Oh man, unfortunately YTA, but it is hard to write this because I think you meant no harm. But definitely talk with your partner before calling his parents grandma and grandpa to your young son who they are meeting for the first time.

How many \u201cgrandkids\u201d will your son have by the time he\u2019s ten if you do that?\n\nYou overstepped everyone\u2019s boundaries and you need to take responsibility for it and admit your mistake.", "Regrettably you didn\u2019t understand that you don\u2019t do that to children. YTA", "YTA - they are NOT grandma and grandpa. And if you get married, that doesn\u2019t automatically change. This will confuse the shit out of your boy.", "ESH. You were way out of line to introduce them that way. For one thing, without discussing it first, and for another, how confusing for your 4yo! \n\nBut everyone else sucks too for saying that they didn\u2019t think you guys were serious after a year and half.", "YTA. Yall have only been dating for a year and a half. To tell your son that those are his grandparents without event asking your boyfriend if that is ok is inconsiderate and rude on your part.", "You've jumped too many steps. It is between your son and your partner what their relationship might look like firstly. Your child might always see him as your boyfriend, so a friend. He might very well see him at some point as a step parent. But it's not for anyone else to decide. The same with introducing to the boyfriends parents. You can't force these things. They take years to develop. You may not have been with the boyfriend long enough for him to be step parent either, let alone his parents being grandparents. They would have needed to have known the child for a long time and the relationship between themselves and the child develop naturally. They're so upset as if you was to break up it would cause so much upset for your child. I feel like you need to be careful in the future in the same way.", "YTA. You don't do something like this without talking it through with all grownups involved. And they'd become his step-grandparents only after marriage anyway.", "YTA- It sounds like you\u2019re also looking for replacement grandparents? It should have been Mr and Mrs X.", "YTA This is so cringey and weird.", "YTA. I can't imagine how you don't see that.  What a bizarre thing to do, and of course you are the assh*le here.  Why in the world would that be an acceptable thing to do to people you don't know!?!", "YTA. This was very forward of you. You have met them 3 times in the year and half you've been with this guy and introduced them by very personal titles. You're not close enough to them to do that. The apology you've been waiting for is one you won't get. You need to apologize", "YTA - why are you putting your kid in this incredibly awkward and inappropriate situation. You\u2019re still in the honeymoon period of your relationship, no commitment has been agreed to, you barely know his parents and you\u2019re already having the kid call them GP!  Yikes!", "You are definitely TA...wow! Presumptuous much. Don't be waiting for your BF to be apologizing any rime soon, and who knows if he can still be called BF. You seriously did wrong here.", "YTA. It's quite a big assumption for you to have your kid refer to anyone by grandma/grandpa.  You should've run it by your boyfriend beforehand.", "YTA mostly because you shouldn't introduce strangers into a role like that. You should wait until your son knows them and have established a close relationship before giving them these names. It doesn't sound like he calls, or thinks of your boyfriend as \"dad\" so why should he think of them as grandparents. You entirely overstepped and will only confuse your kid in the end.", "YTA - You had good intentions but were out of line.  You've been in their company 3 times. You don't have a solid relationship with his parents so why would you introduce them as grandparents to your child? You blindsided your partner.  Although you see yourself married (?) in the future your current actions were wrong.", "Yta on this one... I would have gone with Mr. John and Ms. Mary, for example. Far too soon imo. I would attempt an apology.", "YTA!  You did a MAJOR disservice to your son.", "YTA. Did you call them Mom and Dad without asking as well?  You totally blew it and you owe them an apology.", "YTA. The parents don\u2019t even really know you from the sound of it and they know absolutely nothing about your kid. While your actions aren\u2019t sinister, the fact that you don\u2019t recognize you crossed a boundary makes you the AH.", "YTA. Unless you are engaged, I don't see why you jumped to this conclusion so quickly. Also, you don't even really know his parents and they don't know your son. That's like me calling someone I just met my sister. It feels like you are trying to trap your boyfriend more than anything", "YTA - you can't introduce people you only saw three times as grandma and grandpa without even knowing if they like to be called this by your son.", "YTA. Your poor son. You\u2019re just confusing him. My daughter met my ex\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s mom recently and told me all about \u201cMiss Susan\u201d. It\u2019s really not that hard.", "I don't know what the problem is. I was raised that everyone was aunt and uncle if they were the same age as my parents and grandma and grandpa if they were older but with their names after. Like aunt X or grandpa X cuz it's more polite than calling them by their first name. I don't see it as the AH move but I think everyone should have talked about it before hand.", "yta. i\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t be dating u unless he was serious about becoming a dad and marrying u since u have a literal child but u kinda outed the state of ur relationship before he was ready or notified that you were gonna start telling ppl.", "YTA and \"precious boy\", fyi only you feel that way about him, which is normal, but most people won't. Also, you were being very presumptuous, referring to then as his grandparents.", "YTA you could have just said Jay's parents names instead of \"Grandma\" and \"Grandpa\"", "YTA. I mean come on.", "ESH.  OP because this situation is the flipside of all those posts we see about people trying to assume familial titles too quickly.  Only in this case she is doing the pushing.\n\nThe parent's response was a bit out of line as well.  At least OP now has a temperature reading on how serious BF views this relationship and where he sees it going.", "YTA you\u2019re not thinking of your child\u2019s emotional well being at all.", "Jay's always been so amazing with my son though. It might not be a \"Dad\" relationship by name, but my son loves Jay with all his heart, and Jay's never given any indication he's not ok with this. We never sat down and talked about it, sure, but he never said anything else. I really regret doing this now though", "This is the most complete answer.", "Can guarantee his parents were like \u201cyou SURE you want to be dating a single mom???\u201d after this", "What's your reasoning? Out of curiosity.", "Exactly this. Assuming boyfriend\u2019s parents would be comfortable with grandparent titles is an AH move on OP\u2019s part. Boyfriend is an AH because bringing a romantic partner home for thanksgiving and introducing their child to your parents is a big step, and he didn\u2019t set appropriate expectations. Kids will naturally want to know the social connection and will need to know what to call them. Boyfriend is also kind of an AH for dismissing the relationship as not that serious after the fact, when the thanksgiving invite is a pretty big indicator that the relationship is quite serious.", "I and Jay have never really sat down and talked about this I guess. He's always been so amazing with my son though, that I just kind of assumed he was going to take on that role once we got engaged. My sister though says that Jay's never given off that vibe to her. I plan to have that conversation with him immediately.", "And some people are not in a hurry to be known as grandparents. \nShe put such pressure on the guy to cement the relationship with her single comment that it would not surprise me if her BF ran for the hills.", "yeah yikes. like that\u2019s all i gotta say", "It\u2019s the fact that they\u2019ve met OP about 3 times and never met her son for me.\n\nYTA", "This situation aside, 25 is a perfectly reasonable age for someone to have kids if not younger.

Her son will NEVER forget the moment he was introduced to these \"grandparents\" who don't consider themselves as such. This kid is headed to unnecessary feelings of rejection and abandonment all because of his mother. Poor kid....", "And even after the fact you were shocked that anyone even thought there was a line. How on earth could you think it appropriate to suggest your son call people he has met three times his grandparents?  That\u2019s awkward for them but it\u2019s flat out cruel to him. YTA.", "She also sounds incredibly entitled.", "Consent! Why did she not talk to them and ask how they would like to approach this before hand? If she thinks this relationship is that serious, she should be able to ask them privately. This is like introducing her bf as her husband when they\u2019re not even engaged.\n\nOP needs lead weights to strap her down from leaping so much", "Except, from what I see, they are not even engaged.  He is just the BF.", "I don't believe so as she says that he was cooking dinner and she was bringing the son over but I could be wrong.", "Even if they live together and He spends a lot of time with him, it would be still weird to introduce his parents, whom she has meet 3?!? times as grandparents to her kid, without talking to them first.", "Why would everyone else suck for that? A year and a half isn\u2019t that long and unless they\u2019d gotten engaged or moved in together I\u2019m not sure why everyone else was supposed to assume they\u2019re that serious.", "And OP\u2019s barely met the parents.

The only people I called uncle or aunt were the people that my mom told me where Uncle or Aunt which were her 4 closest friends but other than that My uncle's and aunts where my uncles and aunts and that was it. Nobody is my grandma or grandpa except for my grandparents. OP definitely overstepped here and should have discussed it with her boyfriend and she has the potential to a lot of harm to her kid. Op, YTA", "well see, i grew up like that too (asian culture, its most common there) but that isn\u2019t really a thing in most western places? i think there it\u2019s usually either first names, mr./ms., or sir/ma\u2019am? designating then grandma and grandpa in this case would\u2019ve very clearly been establishing them in the kid\u2019s actual grandparent roles, which is totally inappropriate when they\u2019re meeting for the first time", "What about the part where she admits she did it because she sees him as the one and she decided they were going to skip formalities and be her kids grandparents?  Then their reactions also suggest for this area and family it is not a cultural title thing by age", "Their response appears to be just being awkward about it. They didn\u2019t say anything to the kid or OP.

And it\u2019s terribly unfair to assume that the bf isn\u2019t serious about their 1.5 year relationship because OP decided to marry herself into his family without even having a discussion with him.", "I wish his parents had at least come up to talk, you know? It would have made things less awkward.", "But also, the fact he may take on that role in the future doesn't mean he's in that role *now*.

Where you wind up some day is totally different from *where you are now*, especially if you never even talked about it. 'That formal nonsense' is called *communicating with your partner.*", "Look, I have no doubt that your son \"loves Jay with all his heart\", but that's because he's four years old. Four year Olds are very loving, they get attached to the adults around easily because it's literally an evolutionary survival strategy for them to try to ensure they are taken care of. \n\nThat's why it's YOUR job, as the adult to make sure that you don't get your kid into situations where you're assuming \"oh hey I guess this guy is his new daddy\" without discussing it first. You talk about \"getting engaged\" although you give no indication that you and your partner are on the same page about this, you introduced two people you've met three times as if they were grandparents, and now you're dismayed to find that the assumptions you've made might not be lining up with reality.", "Being \u201camazing\u201d with your son and choosing to take on the father role permanently are two very different things. Totally out of line to assume so much so quickly, one year seems like a long time but it sounds like he and his family aren\u2019t ready for that step and you are definitely out of line to push them into that!

Do you see the issue here?", "He\u2019s never given any indication he\u2019s not OK, because it never occurred to him that you\u2019d make such a huge presumption after 1 1/2 years.", "Does your son call Jay dad?", "If your son doesn't call Jay \"Dad\" a man he has spent a fair bit of time with, why on earth would he call your BF's parents \"Grandma & Grandpa\"? Lol, don't you see how silly that is?", "Unfortunately, YTA. I know that you didn't do this in a malicious manner but that's only the kind of thing that you do when there has been discussions of being married and/or you are already engaged.

Will you discipline my child and how? Are our parenting styles compatible? How will we deal with serious issues if/when they arise? Like severe misbehavior, sexuality/identity, or mental illness? \n\nBy calling his parents grandpa and grandma, you completely disregarded your bf\u2019s feelings and opinions. You jumped forward 8 spaces and left him totally in the dark, instead of addressing the relationship as a team on the same page. \n\nJust because you think things are going great, or that they seem great, doesn\u2019t mean he has the same perspective.
