{"id": 3355, "submission_id": "z64yd5", "title": "AITA for introducing my boyfriend's parents as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" to my son?", "selftext": "This last Thursday I (29 F) went over to my boyfriend \"Jay's\" (25 M) house for thanksgiving and brought my son (4) with me. I and Jay have been together for a year and a half now, and he is the most amazing man in the world. He's been amazing with my son (his bio father is not in his life) and I can genuinely see him as \"the one\". Jay's parents came over as well. It's not that I don't get along with them, it's just I have only ever seen them 3 times before this thanksgiving. I have not had any time to really bond with them I guess. They had never met my son in person either, but they both knew about him.\n\nBy the time I arrived Jay's parents were already there and helping him finish up dinner. We greeted each other and Jay's dad asked \"And who's this little guy.\" I introduced them to my son and then introduced Jay's parents as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" to my precious boy. I didn't notice at the time, but all three of them became quiet almost immediately. I ended up waiting in the living room alone for almost half an hour before dinner and things just were incredibly awkward for the rest of the night. My son did end up calling his parents by grandpa and grandma and I quickly noticed both of them would be very disingenuous and awkward about it over dinner but they did not say anything to me about it. They didn't stick around for long after either but when they left both were very cold to me.\n\nI asked Jay what was their deal and he lost it at me. He claims I put him in an incredibly awkward position. His parents apparently didn't think we were \"That serious\" yet and began to question him if I was only using him as a \"replacement daddy.\" He said that it was way out of line to introduce them that way without even talking to him beforehand. I think it's ridiculous. If one day he's going to be my son's stepdad then why go through this formal nonsense? He claimed that's \"Not the point\" and we ended up fighting till I stormed out.\n\nWe have not talked since and I have simply been waiting for an apology. I talked with my sister about it last night and she said she was mortified to hear this. Saying she also didn't geat the read that we were all that serious and she never felt like Jay intended to take on a \"Dad\" role. This has got me questioning if I was wrong.\n\nedit:\n\nOk,  I messed up.\n\nI genuinely thought Jay would be ok with this. Jay has always treated my son so well, I guess I misread treating him kindly as being ok with being his father figure. I'm pretty sure I ruined this for myself, but most importantly I hurt my son through all this.\n\nEdit 2:  \nI called Jay and apologized. We're going to be taking a break. I'm going to look into making sure I didn't scar my kid with this.", "created_utc": 1669565273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z64yd5/aita_for_introducing_my_boyfriends_parents_as/", "score": 12118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YOU are the AH here. It is YOU who needs to apologize!", "YTA- that\u2019s moving way too fast. You need to discuss that with your boyfriend and his family first, you\u2019re just setting everyone, including your son, up for failure here. You guys have only been dating a year and a half and he hasn\u2019t even proposed yet. Have you maybe thought that, because of his reaction and the fact that his family didn\u2019t think you were serious, your boyfriend may not be in the same place as you are? It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s as serious about your future as you believe that he is and you\u2019ve now created a whole fictitious family that your son is set up to lose. Pump the breaks a little here.", "YTA - You owe his parents and him an apology and you have a conversation to be having with your kid. 18 months is nothing. Unless you\u2019re living together and married (committed to a parenting role) then you have no place to assign grandparent names to your BOYFRIEND\u2019S parents. Boyfriend - not husband. In fact\u2026 I\u2019d go so far as saying you and your boyfriend seem to be in different relationships. He is absolutely nowhere near that level of commitment and blending families. You need take a step back and check yourself.", "You need to apologize to literally everyone else involved. Your child, your bf, and his parents. \n\nYou made things incredibly uncomfortable and awkward because you jumped the gun. It\u2019s not your sole decision to make, the other adults should have a say. Just because you\u2019ve been together and Jay is good w/ the child does not mean he\u2019s now his father or that his parents are ready or comfortable to be called grandma/pa. \n\nYou made a big decision for everyone else without consulting or thinking \n\nYTA", "YTA. There should have been a conversation between you and Jay (or between you and Jay\u2019s parents) about what your son should call his parents. If logistics prevented that talk from happening, then the intro should have been, \u201cSon, this is Jay\u2019s mom and dad\u201d, then they take the lead and they can tell him he should call them Mr & Mrs Smith or Mr Bob and Miss Barb. It\u2019s a real disservice to your son to introduce him to \u201cgrandparents\u201d that he may never see again. I understand your optimism about where this relationship with Jay is headed, but without you and Jay having made any formal plans for the future, you need to tread very lightly when it comes to your son.", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a discussion you need to have with your partner beforehand.", "YTA not just for making it awkward for Jay and his family, but now your kid thinks of them as gramma and grampa...and they might not be. In fact, judging by Jay's reaction, yeah, he hasn't even entertained the idea of marriage to you (and you might have just torpedoed that entirely).  You're going to break your kid's heart.  \n\nYou should have honestly asked his parents how they want to be referred to by your son--it's their son's girlfriend's kid so it's not an unusual question.  It's great to fantasize about a future with a partner, but don't drag your kid into the fantasy. \n\nAnd now you're 'waiting for an apology'. Oh honey.", "YTA and completely oblivious to social norms. You don\u2019t call your boyfriend\u2019s parents grandma and grandpa to your child without at least asking them if they\u2019re ok with those titles first. Especially if they haven\u2019t met the child yet. You also don\u2019t do this unless you\u2019re sure this relationship is going to end in marriage or a very long term partnership. You\u2019ve now confused your child and put your boyfriend\u2019s parents in a very awkward position.", "YTA  \n\n\n  \nYou should totally had have that conversation beforehand with your boyfriend. Doesn't matter that you see him as the one, doesn't matter you have been together for a year and a half, doesn't matter you two are serious about your relationship, because that move from you didn't only impact your bf, but other people (his parents) who didn't ask or choose to be in your life, even less in your son's life.\n\nEven if you end up marrying your gf, you can't impose on his parents to be grand-parents to your son if they don't want it.", "Yikes. YTA. You\u2019ve met these people 3 times. You and their son are not married, not even engaged. \n\nSeems like the two of you are nowhere near on the same page about your relationship. Instead of waiting for an apology\u2026you should probably be preparing for the single life", "YTA You sprung that on people you barely know. That's a lot. You talk these things through with all parties involved. That's not cool to your son, his parents or your bf.", "YTA, it\u2019s been 18 months.", "YTA . Please let the kid decide when and who to give titles to. You should have introduced them as \"Jay's mom and dad (names)\" if eventually they get close enough then switch to grandma. Just like if he wants to call a boyfriend dad, that is his and the other person's choice, not yours. This is super creepy being the 1st time they've met.  building these relationships can take years. Be patient and be careful. The only thing that hurts worse than be abandoned by one dad is being abandoned by another and another. Please be more careful with your son's heart in the future.", "YTA - extremely out of line, and I'm sure, he will not be sthe stepdaddy", "YTA.  You\u2019re going to really screw up your kid by doing things like this.  They didn\u2019t ask for the role, you\u2019re not married, and they don\u2019t know your kid.  Don\u2019t force kids on people and give them inaccurate titles.  Once you\u2019re married, you can discuss this with them.  Either way, the appropriate thing would have been to have a discussion on using \u201cMr./Mrs. X\u201d or their first names.  Just because you chose poorly with bio dad does not give you license to make up roles for anyone your son comes into contact with.", "EDIT: reading your edits, you appear to have listened to people\u2019s comments which is good. I hope you have a productive conversation with your son, boyfriend, and his parents.\n\nYTA. You are only dating and barely met his family. You aren\u2019t engaged or married. You should have talked with him first, but this should not have happened. Just because you see him as \u201cthe one\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it will work out or that you will get married. \n\nYou foisted this on his parents without any conversation with his family and absolutely put him in an awkward situation.\n\nYou owe him and his parents a major apology.", "YTA\n\nEven if you and Jay were **married**, it would still be customary for his parents to have input on whether they are grandparents to your child. \n\nSince you are **only** dating Jay and didn\u2019t consult his parents, you hugely overstepped. You also didn\u2019t bother to consult with Jay. You are merely dating - not married, not even engaged. \n\nSo, even though you believe he is \u201cthe one,\u201d Jay still gets to make decisions about his own life.\n\nYou had a fight and now you\u2019re waiting on his apology. Why? Is this a pattern? Do you fight and then he always gives in and apologizes? Because I cannot see any other reason for you to expect an apology when you are so completely in the wrong. \n\nIf - after reading all these comments - you still don\u2019t get that what you did was wrong, then look into getting some professional help.\n\nLast but far from least, the real victim of your behavior is your son. Your relationship with Jay may not now last. You\u2019ve alienated his parents and possibly pushed Jay too far. Don\u2019t let this be a pattern - bringing people and families into your son\u2019s life prematurely. As a parent, you should work to make his life as stable as possible. Right now, you\u2019ve introduced him to \u201c*grandparents*\u201d he may never see again. Learn from this and protect your son.", "Oh dear. How very awkward for everyone involved.", "YTA- That\u2019s really jumping the gun. They have never even met your child and you are having them called grandma and grandpa? You were definitely out of line.", "YTA. Not only to your BF and parents (who were really sweet not to make a fuss in front of your son), but to your kid too. Suddenly he has grandparents!! What happens if you break up and they just\u2026 disappear? Heartbreaking.", "YTA\nDear, your boyfriend did not express his wish to be the childs father, he is still dating you and seeing where this is going. Maybe someday he would think he is the father. But what you did was disrespectful, you forced the decision without his consent. You made the grandparents who never even met the child and know nothing feel like their son was hiding things from them or that you are forcing their son. It's not a good situation, say your sorry and see if the relationship is atill salvageble", "YTA you seem to be pushing a family who JUST MET YOUR CHILD for the first time on him. You\u2019re an AH to Jay\u2019s parents and to your son. You don\u2019t do this to a child because it\u2019s confusing. And you certainly don\u2019t do this when you haven\u2019t talked to the people involved about what kind of relationship they WANT with your child. Like what in the world\n\nEdit-and you\u2019ve only met the parents 3x. Even bigger AH cause YOU don\u2019t even have that relationship with them", "YTA. That was highly inappropriate and probably super confusing to your little guy.", "YTA. I was so uncomfortable reading this, I cannot imagine living it. \nDeciding someone is going to take on a parent or grandparent role is something that needs to be heavily discussed before and ensure that everyone is on the same page. You don\u2019t spring that on someone, especially in front of your son! I give your bfs parents a ton of credit for not stopping the conversation right then and there.", "YTA\n\nYou are treating him as a replacement daddy, and you got upset when he called you out on your b*llsh!t. \n\nHopefully he leaves you, he deserves better.", "Let me get this straight.\n1) you\u2019ve been dating Jay for a year and a half.\n2) you\u2019ve only met Jay\u2019s parents three times and this is the first time they\u2019ve met your son\n3) you introduced people your son has never met as his grandparents\n4) YOU are waiting on an apology because YOU blindsided everyone with this proclamation. \n\nYeah YTA and I\u2019m really not sure why you think everyone else is. \n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "YTA. You don't get to decide that they are your son's grandparents. Even your bf doesn't get to decide that, but it sounds like he's not ready to be dad, either. And you don't even live together! You put everyone in an awkward position, so of course they were all uncomfortable. It sounds like you're trying to push a relationship that isn't there yet.", "YTA. That was wildly inappropriate not only for your BF and his parents but for your son as well.", "Sorry OP but YTA. \n\nYou should have had this discussion with your bf first. If he agreed, then talk to your son together with your bf. Your bf would have then given his parents the heads up. \n\nInstead, everyone was blindsided and of course it made things awkward. \n\nHave you even had a convo with your bf on how serious you both feel the relationship is going and where it may be headed?", "YTA you are mad because your Go.lddi.gger Tricks not Work.\nI hope he run. This was definitely not the first Red Flag you did.", "YTA. You created an expectation on your bf parents to play a grandparent role without checking with them that they wanted to do that first. Furthermore, your partner may not have discussed with them his plans for his future with you as yet. If you have discussed getting married and they are going to be step grandparents it would have been nicer to let bf be the one to talk to them.", "YTA. Holy boundary issues Batman. Stop screwing with your kid's sense of family and security. Some parents don't introduce their kids to partners for months or years to prevent the type of confusion you chose to create.", "The formal nonsense you talk about is called communication. I don't think I'd even be comfortable introducing my young child to a boyfriend until at least 6 months- year into a relationship. And if I did so it would be after numerous serious conversation about expectations and boundaries. Children become attached really easily and it's up to you as his mother to ensure he doesn't get hurt or emotionally damaged by the people you bring into his life. I'm not even going to vote because I think you realize how wrong this was. But I would honestly think deeply about how it would effect your son if this relationship was to end.", "INFO Did you also call them Mom and Dad?", "YTA. They aren\u2019t his grandparents, and you had no right to foist that title on them.", "YTA. That's a major leap to introduce them with those terms when they don't fulfill that role. And the fact that he may one day be stepdad doesn't mean he's Dad unless you had a serious discussion about if he will take on that role.", "YTA.  You should habe cleared that with your boyfriend and his parents first. I also think you need to end the relationship if everyones saying its not that serious and youre 'hes your new daddy' serious. Big incompatibility there.", "YTA\nYou need to slow your roll", "I feel really bad for you cause you remind me of my mom. But don\u2019t push your kid on to people because it looks right in your head. I always resented how my mom pushed her bfs to be my dad and their family to be mine. Luckily my stepdad and his family get along with me and vice versa but this was very insensitive of you. Also you could really end up confusing and isolating your son when/if you guys break up. \nYTA but I get that you just want love and love for your son you\u2019re going about it the wrong way though. Take a deep breathe and apologize to Jay and his parents. Sit down with your son and say you made a mistake. Jay\u2019s parents are his parents and we will ask them what you should call them.", "YTA", "YTA ~ unless his parents indicate otherwise, they should be introduced to your son as mr. & mrs. whatever.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to declare and introduce his parents as grandparents to your kid without their consent and permission especially to a kid they\u2019ve never met. You made a lot of assumptions without communicating any of it with your partner.", "YWBTA if you don\u2019t call everyone and apologize. I would say you didn\u2019t think things through and reacted on the spot, and you are very sorry and did not mean to confuse everyone. If YOU are confused, though, then that is a much bigger relationship discussion. He is 25 and may not be in the same place as you, you may want to know that at this point.", "... you're kidding right?\n\nYTA", "If someone made me their kid\u2019s new grandma the first time I met them I would be extremely uncomfortable and probably never want to meet them ever again.", "YTA\n\nWow, that\u2019s stuff to talk about beforehand!\nAnd then it might still take time, until his parents decide for themselves what your son may call them at one point in your relationship!\n\nPlease, take a quiet moment for yourself, and truly truly dig into the idea, if you took your BF and his parents basically hostage, with your son being a gun held to their breasts. How on earth can you confuse your own child like that. I\u2019m stunned tbh. \n\nHowever, a little \u201cwow\u201d goes out to his parents for finding daggers for words so quickly about your relationship. That also kinda stings.

So much second hand embarrassment right now.", "YTA. You are trying to force a relationship that isn't there... \n I am literally the boyfriend's parents in this situation.

We have always been close with this girls family so her children know me and I have babysat for them multiple times. She asked me what I want the girls to call me... Grandma and nana are taken....I said I was fine with them calling me aunt as they always have... Grandma is a very special name and I haven't earned that.

Now your son thinks these are his grandparents, when they're not actually related to him, and haven't accepted a grandparent role in his life.

He might very well see him at some point as a step parent. But it's not for anyone else to decide. The same with introducing to the boyfriends parents. You can't force these things. They take years to develop. You may not have been with the boyfriend long enough for him to be step parent either, let alone his parents being grandparents. They would have needed to have known the child for a long time and the relationship between themselves and the child develop naturally. They're so upset as if you was to break up it would cause so much upset for your child. I feel like you need to be careful in the future in the same way.", "YTA.

Especially because any attempts from her to fix this are probably going to make her look desperate to stay with him, which is not going to reassure him at all that she\u2019s okay with him not being at the level of commitment she wants yet.", "\"Jay, you are The One.  Yes!  At age 25, YOU have been selected to be the father to my precious son,  No, you don't have to thank me.  I can see that you don't know what to say.  \n\nYo!  Grandpa and Grandma, come here!!

Definitely not something that should be done, especially without being upfront about it from the beginning.

The point is, without specific instructions to the contrary, you start with the formal and progress from there.  \n\nAnd since you mentioned co-workers, you should let them take the lead there too.

I suspect what you were really trying to do was suss out whether or not your bf is serious about you or not but went about it childishly and manipulatively.

You can not be this clueless as a single parent. You just broke all of the rules and boundaries of a newer relationship. And yes it is newer.

They were just coming for some dinner not a new grandchild. That grandparent/child relationship is special and you can\u2019t force it. Now you ruined the potential bond they could\u2019ve had with you son.", "YTA. Your poor son. How incredibly confusing for him. His first time in meeting these people and you tell him they\u2019re his grandparents. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t blame Jay for wanting space from you, that is a conversation that should have been had between the two of you instead of dropping the \u2018We\u2019re family\u2019 bomb.", "Not an asshole but what you did was not the best judgment call.", "You say how if he is going to be your son's step-dad why would you bother with the formal stuff. It doesn't sounds like you talked about this at all with your SO and so yes, it does sound like you are trying to use his as a father replacement.", "YTA. While you're definitely wrong, I can't completely blame you for this. Society has been gassing mothers' heads up for years. Including single mothers. It wouldn't be surprising if you are one of them. If so, stop listening to those people. They're completely off base. It's great that you love your son, but that doesn't mean \"any man would be lucky to be in his life\". Children are like poems.

I gotta point out though, OP and Jay should have had this conversation way back. It\u2019s only too early bc they didn\u2019t discuss it first. Jay is obviously gonna be dad and they are gonna be grandma and grandpa, if the relationship continues. And that convo should have occurred sometime in the first year, not halfway through the second. OP messed up,  but thinking this is forever after a year and a half isn\u2019t the problem per se. It\u2019s thinking that and not talking with her bf. The poor communication suggests to me that nobody involved is quite ready for marriage. But again, that\u2019s a conclusion that they have to come to by having a conversation about it. Shit like this makes me glad I\u2019m older and in a relationship. Fuck dating.", "He could\u2019ve been 23 when they started dating, she should be dating her own age.

SMH", "Plus OP's sister when she was told.", "It definitely seems manipulative. OP thought they\u2019d pull this off somehow and force these people into a family role.", "So true. And they have only been dating for a year and a half. Both from the standpoint of bf's age (only 25 - he needs another five years before considering marriage) and how short their relationship is, OP jumped the gun here, big time.", "You hit the nail on the head as these were my thoughts exactly.\n\nA lot of parents would be quite concerned if their 25 year old son were involved with a 29 year old woman with a four year old child.\n\nThere isn't sufficient background in terms of what their lives are but OP got her hooks into him when the guy was 23 or so which is quite young for a lot of guys especially if they went to university. They are just feeling their way in the world.\n\nThis is true of women as well of course as I think many parents wouldn't be thrilled if their relatively young daughter were involved with an older divorced guy who was bringing step children into the mix.\n\nThings happen but blended families aren't the easiest - and here is a situation in which the bio dad isn't involved which means no financial support either I would suspect.\n\nOP has gotten a lot of comments indicating that she was out of line so not to pile it on but obviously OP was mistaken about the commitment level of her boyfriend - or more accurately I would suspect ex boyfriend. She was thinking marriage - he was thinking what is probably his first quasi-serious relationship. In my circle of friends and kids of friends, the norm is not to get married until early 30's and there is generally a first serious relationship in the early 20's which doesn't end in marriage. I guess in some ways it is equivalent to getting married young - divorced and then married a second time in 30's with the second marriage having greater longevity.\n\nOP should learn to read the room. If you haven't discussed marriage, it almost certainly means the guy isn't thinking about marriage. He actually told you that since he said they didn't know he was serious which means HE was not serious.", "Even OPs own sister didn\u2019t know it was that serious lol", "When I read OP's assertion that she thinks her boyfriend is \"the one,\" I wondered if the boyfriend thought the same about her.
