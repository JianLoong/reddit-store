I understand that she wants to protect her son (especially if he has a deadbeat dad) but your sons have a mom who wants pictures of her kids.", "NTA  \n\nShe's overreacting.  \nThe picture wasn't even for yourself but for the boys' mom.  \nShe has no relation the your stepson.", "**NTA** \n\nIt was a single photo that their mother requested. \n\nYou did not exclude the other children from the vacation or demand they step out of every photo. \n\nYour wife is being very weird about this.", "NTA.  This was a picture for their biological mother.  Maybe, next time, off to take one for your step-son's biological father.", "NTA. You were very clear about the reason for taking that one picture.", "NTA- She\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. A couple of pics out of dozens of pics isn\u2019t excluding anybody. You\u2019re not going to fit every kid in every pic, anywhere.", "NTA. Like someone else said, this is probably much more about your wife\u2019s own insecurities about you doing something nice for your ex than a picture.", "NTA. Your ex probably just wanted a pic of HER kids. It's not that serious. You took other pics of them all together.", "NTA\n\nThe kids mom asked a picture of HER kids. Stepson is not her kid in any shape or form. I'm guessing your wife is jealous that your ex still wants more contact with the kids comparing to her ex. But that's on her ex, not on you, your ex wife, your kids.", "NTA\n\nShe is overreacting. You were taking a photo for the boys mother. To be sent to their mother. Their mother probably wants a picture of Her children, not the step and half siblings included every now and again.", "NTA \n\nShe projecting her and her kid\u2019s issues with the father onto you.", "NTA. Your Ex wanted a picture of her bio kids, what if she wanted to get the picture framed or into a photo album? You took photos of all the kids as well. I don\u2019t understand where your wife is coming from. I\u2019d ask her if she has a different motivation behind her outburst?\n\nIt sounds like you and your ex has a good co-parenting relationship. How is your wife\u2019s co-parenting relationship with her ex?", "NTA.  In families where both biological parents are still married to each other and have multiple children, not every photo is of all the children.", "NTA: I would honestly question your wife's insecurities if she genuinely got upset about you sending your ex a picture of her children.\n\nI assume the step-child doesn't have a relationship with your ex, so the inclusion of him in this scenario is unnecessary.\n\nThe step child or his mother can't expect him to be included in everything that involves that side of the family.", "NTA\nIt was a pic for their mother. Blended families will always have places where the circles don't completely overlap.", "Definitely NTA in this situation. I\u2019d keep talking with your wife about it though. Seems like a situation where she hasn\u2019t been fully truthful about her feelings and blew up in this moment. That might be why it feels overboard", "NTA\n\nShe should understand that your ex is not interested in a photo of her son.\n\nI wonder if it\u2018s jealousy and if she\u2018d prefer to have him on the picture \u201eto remind your ex that you have a new family\u201c.", "NTA", "Nta but you could play along and take one of them alone and then one of them all together and say \"let's send mom a picture of you with your siblings so she can see how much fun you are all having \" or something like that. But she overreacted completely. Most people would not want pictures of their kids sent to the partners ex?", "NTA - but it seems your wife thinks you don't love your step son enough. Do you ever treat your bio kids differently in terms of favoritism?", "NTA. It seems like the problem runs deeper than just a family photo", "I say NAH because she's behaving irrationally and projecting her own perspective onto her son, but it's coming from a place of wanting the best for him and having had to deal with a deadbeat dad. But she should be careful that he doesn't pick up on her insecurity as he may actually start to question his relationship with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ask your wife is she would send her husband a pic of your kids.", "NTA. She is overreacting. \nIts a really RED FLAG. \nBe carefull, maybe she is gonna star push all the kid have time together no Matter they want or not.", "NTA. Your ex probably would\u2019ve been offended if you sent her a pic with all the kids. Try asking your wife how she would feel if the father of her son sent her a pic with his new kids. Maintaining a good co-parenting relationship with the ex and respecting their boundaries if possible is very important for the kids and it is also beneficial for the new partner. Less stress for everyone. Your wife clearly has issues with her son\u2019s father not being as involved but that isn\u2019t your fault. If the kids in a blended family get some alone time with both their birth parent and the step parent they will feel seen and cherished. Forcing them to be a lump package all the time is likely to create resentments. Have you talked about how you two are going to handle step-parenting before getting married? Sounds like some couples therapy would be helpful. Otherwise this will happen every time you do something with your kids only which is bound to and should happen sometimes.", "This right here. Sounds like she wants to make a crazy point to your ex about her and her son being your priority now and not your ex. \nShe\u2019s definitely jealous. Question though, why did she not mention the baby being \u201cexcluded\u201d? Maybe some other issues here\n\nIt sounds like he has a good co parenting relationship with his ex.

You might be on to something here.\n\nNTA", "From how he wrote it I\u2019m kinda wondering if she\u2019s jealous that he has a good co-parenting relationship with his ex & that they\u2019re both involved in their kids\u2019 lives, whereas she & her ex do not. Like maybe it got to her that her ex didn\u2019t also care enough to also want a picture of their kid after him being away for 10 days.\n\nNTA.", "This. NtA", "No, that's probably a very bad idea. If the guy is a deadbeat then saying that they should get a picture of him for his dad might get him excited only to hurt him more in the end. I do understand the wife's perspective though, she's probably protective from watching her son get pushed aside by his dad and doesn't want to see the same thing happen with her husband. NTA but maybe try talking to her when she's a little calmer, seems like she went into mama bear mode.", "An asshole can still do asshole things with good intentions."]}
