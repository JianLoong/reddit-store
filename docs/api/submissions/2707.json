This was a picture for their biological mother.  Maybe, next time, off to take one for your step-son's biological father.", "NTA. You were very clear about the reason for taking that one picture.", "NTA- She\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. A couple of pics out of dozens of pics isn\u2019t excluding anybody. You\u2019re not going to fit every kid in every pic, anywhere.", "NTA. Like someone else said, this is probably much more about your wife\u2019s own insecurities about you doing something nice for your ex than a picture.", "NTA. Your ex probably just wanted a pic of HER kids. It's not that serious. You took other pics of them all together.", "NTA\n\nThe kids mom asked a picture of HER kids. Stepson is not her kid in any shape or form. I'm guessing your wife is jealous that your ex still wants more contact with the kids comparing to her ex. But that's on her ex, not on you, your ex wife, your kids.", "NTA\n\nShe is overreacting. You were taking a photo for the boys mother. To be sent to their mother.

Your Ex wanted a picture of her bio kids, what if she wanted to get the picture framed or into a photo album? You took photos of all the kids as well. I don\u2019t understand where your wife is coming from. I\u2019d ask her if she has a different motivation behind her outburst?\n\nIt sounds like you and your ex has a good co-parenting relationship. How is your wife\u2019s co-parenting relationship with her ex?", "NTA.  In families where both biological parents are still married to each other and have multiple children, not every photo is of all the children.", "NTA: I would honestly question your wife's insecurities if she genuinely got upset about you sending your ex a picture of her children.\n\nI assume the step-child doesn't have a relationship with your ex, so the inclusion of him in this scenario is unnecessary.\n\nThe step child or his mother can't expect him to be included in everything that involves that side of the family.", "NTA\nIt was a pic for their mother.

Do you ever treat your bio kids differently in terms of favoritism?", "NTA. It seems like the problem runs deeper than just a family photo", "I say NAH because she's behaving irrationally and projecting her own perspective onto her son, but it's coming from a place of wanting the best for him and having had to deal with a deadbeat dad.

Ask your wife is she would send her husband a pic of your kids.", "NTA. She is overreacting. \nIts a really RED FLAG. \nBe carefull, maybe she is gonna star push all the kid have time together no Matter they want or not.", "NTA. Your ex probably would\u2019ve been offended if you sent her a pic with all the kids. Try asking your wife how she would feel if the father of her son sent her a pic with his new kids. Maintaining a good co-parenting relationship with the ex and respecting their boundaries if possible is very important for the kids and it is also beneficial for the new partner. Less stress for everyone. Your wife clearly has issues with her son\u2019s father not being as involved but that isn\u2019t your fault. If the kids in a blended family get some alone time with both their birth parent and the step parent they will feel seen and cherished. Forcing them to be a lump package all the time is likely to create resentments. Have you talked about how you two are going to handle step-parenting before getting married? Sounds like some couples therapy would be helpful. Otherwise this will happen every time you do something with your kids only which is bound to and should happen sometimes.", "This right here. Sounds like she wants to make a crazy point to your ex about her and her son being your priority now and not your ex. \nShe\u2019s definitely jealous. Question though, why did she not mention the baby being \u201cexcluded\u201d? Maybe some other issues here\n\nIt sounds like he has a good co parenting relationship with his ex. NTA but his wife definitely is.", "I like this take on the situation.  You might be on to something here.\n\nNTA", "From how he wrote it I\u2019m kinda wondering if she\u2019s jealous that he has a good co-parenting relationship with his ex & that they\u2019re both involved in their kids\u2019 lives, whereas she & her ex do not. Like maybe it got to her that her ex didn\u2019t also care enough to also want a picture of their kid after him being away for 10 days.\n\nNTA.", "This. NtA", "No, that's probably a very bad idea. If the guy is a deadbeat then saying that they should get a picture of him for his dad might get him excited only to hurt him more in the end. I do understand the wife's perspective though, she's probably protective from watching her son get pushed aside by his dad and doesn't want to see the same thing happen with her husband. NTA but maybe try talking to her when she's a little calmer, seems like she went into mama bear mode.", "An asshole can still do asshole things with good intentions.", "NTA, ask her why does she think your boys mom would want a picture of her son? \n\nThat\u2019s literally all you need to say to the 7 year old too, \u201cthe boys mom misses them and wanted a picture of just them, not me, you, sister or your mom\u201d. 7 is old enough to understand that, too bad your wife isn\u2019t as bright as a 7 year old.", "Ex#2 good luck with this one \nNTA", "NTA. \"Why would my ex want a pic of your kid?\" \n\nRidiculous.", "NTA. I have to wonder if something deeper is going on, like jealousy or your ex saying things to the new wife.", "I like to believe there is a reason behind getting so worked up over 1 picture that was meant for your kids' mom.\n\nNTA. And you may have married her too soon.", "NTA. This level of overreaction must be quite off-putting. Their biological mother has every right to ask for pictures of her kids.", "NTA- sounds like she's jealous of you being nice to your ex by sending a picture of your kids together. She obviously doesn't have that co parent relationship with her ex. You did nothing wrong it's nice you remembered to do so and stuck your ground. She needs to get over it as it shouldn't be something that ever changes as it's what healthy coparenting looks like.", "NTA. And she is over reacting! Why isn\u2019t she mad that your daughter wasn\u2019t in the picture too? She\u2019s upset/jealous whatever of the relationship that your boys have with your ex. The fact that her ex seems to be a jerk (guessing anyhow) isn\u2019t your issue. You did absolutely nothing wrong with snapping a few pictures of just your kids to send to your ex. Your wife needs some counseling to deal with her emotions!", "NTA. She is a reacting, and she's lying to you about what the issue is fuck with your head. You are not hurting your stepson, how jealous is she of you having an okay co-parenting relationship with your ex?", "NTA. My ex decided not to take our kids for a holiday that was \u201chis\u201d per our parenting agreement, but he asked for a photo (after the fact). All I had were photos of everyone together. My husband and I don\u2019t want him to have anything to do with the other kids because reasons, so I ended up cropping everyone else out of a photo where they were standing next to each other.", "Wtf you can\u2019t take a picture of the kids you share with your ex? She is looking for a fight and she picked a dumb hill to stand in. NTA", "NTA. This is a big over reaction. Wife owes you an apology but you need to have a conversation with her.", "NTA.  She's trying to over compensate because her child father is a deadbeat.  She's making a big deal out of nothing.  Her son more than likely didn't even think anything of it.  He will if he sees his mom being over the top.", "NTA. Your wife is salty because you took a pic of your boys and sent it to their mom. She can dress it up all she likes but the green eyed minster showed up on vacation with you all because what you did was reasonable. She is just pissed that her son doesn't have the other parent to enjoy his experiences. Not your fault and she needs to get over herself. You did the right thing.", "Nta, your ex wants to see HER kids. A couple pictures here and there isn't wrong.", "NTA. Your wife is jealous that your ex has a part of you that she never will.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get why she\u2019d want your ex to have pictures of her son anyways.", "NTA. She's being ridiculous. Why does your wife think your ex would want a picture of your wife's kid?", "NTA.\n\nYou are right that she is overreacting. Plus she needs to learn that not everyone will be included in everything and it's not about being mean. People and groups of people will have their own things and that is ok. I would honesty look at this situation as a red flag.", "NTA.  Your sons mother asked for a pic of her sons. You took pics of all your kids, stepson included, but sent a pic of just your sons to their mother. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\n\nSad to see a jealousy woman using her child as a an excuse to be a shitty person.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with the kids. It's about your ex. Your wife is jealous that you can co-parent so well you are able to send happy pictures to eachother. If I don't like someone, I'm not going to send them updates and reassurance that everything is going good.", "NTA \n\nIt was very nice to take a picture for your ex who doesn't need your stepson or daughter in the picture. Your wife needs to grow up and realize that there are things that will be separate for the 3 boys and your 2 having a different mom ties into that.", "Exactly, your wife is jealous you have any kind of relationship with your ex. Especially, a good one where you\u2019ll share these memories with her", "Agreed that she is being unreasonable. If OP had taken a photo of just his sons and his daughter to send out family, that would be a different matter. But, OP's ex should be able to get a photo of just her children. OP's stepson is not the ex's child and has no connection to her. It would be an AH move to deprive the mom of a picture of her own kids. \n\nOP's wife may even be upset that he has what **appears** to be a good coparenting relationship with his ex (based only on this interaction) and she doesn't have the same with her son's father. Or, like other commenters have said, she may be jealous or want OP to rub his new family in his ex's face (which would be really sad if that's the case.)", "Why doesn\u2019t her ex want a picture of just his son?", "From what she said it sounds like she has issues with her ex and how he treats his biological son. So seeing a healthy co-parenting relationship caused a jealous reaction because she wants but does not have one. This is about **her**, not her child. \n\nNTA", ">Question though, why did she not mention the baby being \u201cexcluded\u201d? Maybe some other issues here\n\nSomeone else mentioned that she's not jealous that OP is doing something for his ex but that he has a good relationship with his ex and his ex cares for their children while her ex doesn't seem to care for their child", "I thought this too.", "Yeah I feel like the picture is just a symptom, but not the cause, of her reaction. \n\nOP and his ex get along well enough to keep the lines of communication open to send each other pics and updates of the kids on their time. He didn\u2019t have to send her a pic, but he did it because it would make the kids happy, and his ex appreciative. They sounds like great co-parents. \n\nI think his new wife is sad and lashing out because her sons dad would never ask for a photo or any updates of their son. Her step kids have two very loving and involved parents. \n\nI\u2019d be concerned of her turning into the type of stepparent to demand the new spouse put her kid first. There are so many stories on here alone or kids who were pushed aside in favor of their step siblings. It almost always starts with a step parent dealing with unbridled jealousy."]}
