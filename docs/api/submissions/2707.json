Your ex probably would\u2019ve been offended if you sent her a pic with all the kids. Try asking your wife how she would feel if the father of her son sent her a pic with his new kids. Maintaining a good co-parenting relationship with the ex and respecting their boundaries if possible is very important for the kids and it is also beneficial for the new partner. Less stress for everyone. Your wife clearly has issues with her son\u2019s father not being as involved but that isn\u2019t your fault. If the kids in a blended family get some alone time with both their birth parent and the step parent they will feel seen and cherished. Forcing them to be a lump package all the time is likely to create resentments. Have you talked about how you two are going to handle step-parenting before getting married?

If the guy is a deadbeat then saying that they should get a picture of him for his dad might get him excited only to hurt him more in the end.

They sounds like great co-parents. \n\nI think his new wife is sad and lashing out because her sons dad would never ask for a photo or any updates of their son. Her step kids have two very loving and involved parents. \n\nI\u2019d be concerned of her turning into the type of stepparent to demand the new spouse put her kid first.

This was a photo specifically intended for 1 person, the mother of your sons. \n\nYour wife is over-reacting, however, I can understand how she might be overly sensitive about the topic if her son has a poor relationship with his dad; so while it doesn't excuse her behavior, I'd say that perhaps you could approach the topic in a different way, it sounds like she's insecure on behalf of her son, as a mom I totally understand being protective of your child and fearing that situations might repeat themselves.", "NTA and she overreacted.", "YTA, you shouldn't exclude no matter what. Inclusion should always happen at this stage and let them decide when they don't want to be a part of it.", "ESH. She\u2019s overreacting and why can\u2019t you include her son in the picture to your ex? I send my ex pictures all the time that include my husband\u2019s daughter. Why would she care? It\u2019s your vacation with your family. If she wants pictures without your stepson then she needs to get them and take her own. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about his ex. I think it\u2019s about hers. She\u2019s taking her anger out on OP because his kids\u2019 other parent is decent and involved and her kid\u2019s other parent has \u201cissues\u201d. The comment about begging for stepdad\u2019s love \u201cas well\u201d is really revealing. She wanted to play happy family and acknowledging OP\u2019s ex for even the length of one photo ruined that.", "Yes it is about jealousy. Because every parent has pictures of their children alone or with just 2 of the 3 or more children. Because not all children are always at exact the same location when you want to take a picture. \n\nI also have a stepson and we take a ton of pictures of him and our son. But we also take a ton of pictures of just him and often send one to his mother and stepdad (I am the stepmom and together with the father). We mostly send pictures of him alone. His mother and stepdad love to see him of course and for them our son is less interesting (because it is not their child) and that is fine with me. I never think our son is excluded. We take a ton of pictures, also when my stepson is not at our place, so I have millions and millions and millions of pictures of both boys. Together and alone. \n\nSo OP NTA.", "100%, her son is a scapegoat. She is jealous.", "I actually think it is about *her* ex. My guess is that her ex never asked for photos of his son and that has made her aware. She feels her son is left out because he only has one caring parent.", "This right here is everything. \n\nNTA but might I suggest getting a babysitter and then you two maybe head out with the intentions of just connecting by talking about insecurities, general feelings, catch up with Jay each other as yourselves instead of in your life rolls. \nSometimes we (humans) just need to talk or be reassured, etc.\n\nAnd also, sometimes jealousy is just that (if that's the case) and honestly I have no help for that, sorry, but totally NTA!", "Could also be past trauma. \n\nIt doesn't seem to me like jealousy as she didn't mention the ex being an issue. \n\nShe did mention though that the kid has issues with bio dad. Could be something deeper there where she is terrified of her kid going through it again. She might need some help there getting over her own fears. \n\nIt is clear though that she is over reacting. What is left to find out is if it's because of jealousy as the comment says or if it's because of trauma with whatever went on with the ex. \n\nEither way OP NTA. But do speak to your wife and get to the bottom of this issue. Either you already know and are omitting this info, or you didn't give it a second thought. \n\nOr obviously you could be pointing just one instance but there mightve been more situation similar to this one. I don't know. I can't know. But from the post I'd go with past trauma.", "NTA. Yeah... I'm often on the your the AH side in stepparents doing things differently for bio vs non-bio. But, a single or even a couple of pics for their bio-mom out of many many pictures seems like a kind co-parent to me. And, a silly response from the now-wife. (As long as there aren't other things going on - like consistent double-standards, etc., of course.)", "NTA", "Absolutely.  I think her poor kid got burned by Dad, and she's terrified that he'll get burned by Stepdad as well.\n\nThat's making her unable to see that this is about the kid's Mom wanting to see her child having a happy experience (no offense, she probably doesn't really care about the kids who aren't hers), and him doing something nice in hopes that she'll reciprocate when the situation is reversed.  It's not the beginning of him also abandoning her son.\n\nShe might need counselling to help her perspective - otherwise, if she makes life unbearable for OP regarding this issue, it's going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "So he sends his ex a picture of a kid that isn't hers cos he cannot send her a picture of her own children only??? How does his child concern his ex? \n\nWhat logic is this?", "Wait...so you're telling me people can actually have a good coparenting relationship?! It's an actual thing?\n\n/s", "That is also a possibilty. Maybe both. One reason might enhance the other.", "This might be the underlying issue here. In their family, OPs two sons have a mother, a father and a stepmother, but his stepson doesn't seem to have any relationship with his father and maybe he has expressed his feelings to OPs wife. I think OPs wife and stepson may benefit from some therapy if her ex is not in their son's life at all or even regardless of the situation, as it seems that these issues are then taken out on their whole family.", "I think that may be part of the problem. Her son doesn't have two involved parents but OP's kids do.", "They are the ex for a reason, she can take whatever pictures she wants when she has the boys. He has a new family now and that should be his focus.", "This is what I keep thinking. Everyone keeps accusing her of being jealous, but I think she\u2019s just worried about another man letting her son down.", "Yeah, but she's converting it into aggression against OP and his kids, that's not fair"]}
