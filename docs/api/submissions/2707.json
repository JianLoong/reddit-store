Your ex probably would\u2019ve been offended if you sent her a pic with all the kids. Try asking your wife how she would feel if the father of her son sent her a pic with his new kids. Maintaining a good co-parenting relationship with the ex and respecting their boundaries if possible is very important for the kids and it is also beneficial for the new partner. Less stress for everyone. Your wife clearly has issues with her son\u2019s father not being as involved but that isn\u2019t your fault. If the kids in a blended family get some alone time with both their birth parent and the step parent they will feel seen and cherished. Forcing them to be a lump package all the time is likely to create resentments. Have you talked about how you two are going to handle step-parenting before getting married?

If the guy is a deadbeat then saying that they should get a picture of him for his dad might get him excited only to hurt him more in the end.

They sounds like great co-parents. \n\nI think his new wife is sad and lashing out because her sons dad would never ask for a photo or any updates of their son. Her step kids have two very loving and involved parents. \n\nI\u2019d be concerned of her turning into the type of stepparent to demand the new spouse put her kid first.

This is about jealousy and control regarding your ex", "NTA but watch it OP she might treat your sons badly behind closed doors if she is this jealous over a picture being sent to your ex, she might also start pushing you to ignore your son's to pay more attention to your daughter with her and her son. Imo I think she wants you to put her son over yours to show you care more for your new family", "It's either jealousy or she's cheating", "In this case, she should be thankful for her lovely new partner who takes her son on vacation and treats him like another one of his own kids.... just not his ex's kid.", "So tf what if their OP ex wife he wants to send pictures of their children to her he can his wife needs to back tf off", "It happens more often that we know\u2026watching it in real time with my 5 year old niece\u2026heartbreaking to see her mom choose the bf\u2019s daughter over her own kid (my niece) because the bf is a jealous prick", "You sound stupid asf because for one that is called good coparenting he is sending pictures to his ex of their sons they share his new wife is jealous he has a good relationship with his children mother while she has none with her son father she needs to take a step back", "Makes me so angry. My niece deals with that too. From both her parents. Constantly picking their new relationships, and other children, over her. \n\nI don\u2019t get people who are jealous of their partners being good parents to their own kids.

If you had done the majority split or only posted that one fair enough.", "NTA, OP. Your wife is looking for a fight where there's none. Maybe ask her what the real problem is with you taking pics of your boys for their mother. If she had a good relationship with her ex, in sure she would be doing the same thing as well. That's just uncalled for, her yelling at you for taking pics of just your boys. She's way out of line with that kind of behavior. I guess, it's as others have commented about your wife being jealous of your ex. I would not tolerate that kind of behavior, being yelled at like that.", "NTA  What you did was perfectly reasonable thing to do.  Your wife on the other hand is projecting alot of things on to you.  Keep standing up for your boys.", "NTA. She IS overreacting. It was for the sole purpose of sending to their mom.

For Halloween this yr, I edited a photo of my son (13) and stepson (14). I removed my own kid bc I teenagers are buttheads and barely cooperated for 1 photo. I've sent her pics of both boys in the past but I she may want to make a collage or post it on her social media so I try to not include my son as much as possible. Same for my sons dad. Why would he want a picture of my stepson for his SM? It's not excluding the kids and they are fully aware we take separate pics sometimes for their other parent. It's a perfectly normal thing for us and no feelings are hurt. I don't expect pictures of my sons dads daughter or stepsons moms kids.", "NAH.\n\nShe's upset because her son doesn't have the same support system (another loving parent) and it sort of upset her to realize that your sons are biological brothers whereas hers isn't.\n\nHer feelings are hurt seeing her baby hurt (perceived or real).", "NTA - this right here exactly", "Or something way better to rub in the boys or OP ex face that he did something way better for stepson and the kid they share together", "Happy Cake Day \ud83c\udf82", "Because his ex has no relationship nor does she know his stepson why should she get a picture of her sons with a random kid she never knew", "Because that's not his ex kid she had 2 with him not 2 and a half \ud83d\ude44", "Why shouldn't he take a picture of his kids for their mother?

I\u2019m guessing from her response it\u2019s because his dad doesn\u2019t seem to care as much as your ex but she could still send the picture.

So I get it, but she's upset with her ex, not with you. She needs to realize that. You cannot be responsible or held accountable for his actions. It's not fair to you. You're not responsible for making up for his failings. You're just supposed to be a good step-dad to him, and it sounds like you are. The sad truth is, no matter how much you both love and care for him, it might not erase the hurt his father causes. Unfortunately, there is no way around that, but even he will see that you are 2 different people and treat you both accordingly.", "Info: how come you didn\u2019t send one of all the kids when ex asked for a photo?
