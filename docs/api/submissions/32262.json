She agreed and so did her mother (who I will call Maria). We have a friendly relationship with Maria where we exchange quick messages, we are not best friends, but we trust each other \n\nIt was agreed that Julia would stay from Friday night until Sunday afternoon and Maria would pick her up. \n\nToday, my wife went out to do some shopping and I stayed with the girls. \n\nMy daughter screamed my name and when I got close, she said that Julia was on her period and was crying and that she didn't know what to do. But she had taught her how to put on the pad (she already had her period). \n\nI'm not an expert on this subject, but I talked to her to calm her down, asking if it was hurting, if she was feeling anything and explaining that it was something natural in the female body and that there was nothing wrong. It was a good 10 minutes before she calmed down because she was apologizing because she had stained the mattress etc. \n\nAfter I saw that she relaxed, I called my wife to come to the house as soon as possible (to help me) and then I called Maria, explaining the situation and what I had done to help. \n\nShe was very rude and said she was coming to get her. \n\nWhen she arrived and Julia was in the car, she started saying that she thought it was inappropriate for me to have talked to her daughter and that it should have at least been my wife talking and not a man and that I crossed all possible boundaries. \n\nI tried to explain by saying that I just calmed down a child who had no idea what menstruation was and freaking out.

You did the right thing comforting her and talking to her about things her own mother clearly didn't. The conversation was **not** inappropriate in any way. Just because an old fashioned, sexist person thinks that periods are not to be discussed about or even mentioned by males does not make you an AH for helping someone.", "Nta. If Julia was okay talking to you, that\u2019s all that matters. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to have her sit there for 30 minutes scared if there was someone there who could calm her down sooner. The fact that your daughter is comfortable calling you for help with these matters shows you are good at handling sensitive issues just fine.", "You did the right thing. You helped out a distressed and upset child. The mother should have already had this chat with the girl before, so if she were to have her first period, it would not be such a freaky thing. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter what gender you are. If she has a problem because a male helped out, that's just sexist.\n\nNTA", "NTA you did the best you could to comfort an upset child. Yes the subject was a sensitive one but you appear to have handled it to the best of your ability without being inappropriate.\n\nShe can be upset but it doesn't appear justifiable from the story you told.", "Sounds like Maria has some extremely old fashioned ideas.\n\nNTA", "NTA. At some point everyone has to be able to talk about periods without shame or stigma (and that includes men with daughters/girls in their care, as was your case). Maria should have talked with her daughter about a year ago about this and normalized it for the kid so she didn\u2019t freak out at someone else\u2019s house, but hindsight is 20/20.", "NTA \n\nThe only asshole here is Maria who had never had that talk with her daughter, it\u2019s ridiculous that at 11 she didn\u2019t know about periods", "NTA but the mom was for not having the conversation with her daughter in the first place. She was at the age it could happen, this is on the mother for not educating her daughter.\n\n\nIf you had shown her how to put on a pad that would be crossing the line but that's not what happened. You explained it was natural and calmed her.  Good job being a better parent to someone else's kid.\n\nThe mother should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA - you were doing what you could to comfort a young girl who was panicking because she didn't understand why she was bleeding.\n\nYou simply told her it was natural and called your wife and Julia's mother.  Julia's mother owes you an apology, and one to her daughter for not preparing her for what was coming.", "NTA. It's stupid to say that only women can talk to about periods. You did the right thing and I'm sure if you were a woman and Julia was a little boy having some kind of boy problem that you knew about, you'd try to help them too.", "Poor girl. :-(\n\nI started my period at my best friend\u2019s house. All of the kids were in bed and I went to the bathroom and just sat on the toilet bleeding. Her dad was awake and when I didn\u2019t come out, he asked if I was alright, told me where the pads were and made me hot chocolate and sat up with me until I fell asleep on the couch. It was not weird at all. Of course, the two key differences here are that my mother had already provided me with the necessary information and I was very well acquainted with my bestie\u2019s dad; our families swapped children back and forth relatively frequently. So I can\u2019t say for certain that I would not have been mortified in a situation more like Julia\u2019s, but I do believe that his handling of it helped make an awful experience bearable and normalize something many people find taboo. I\u2019m grateful that he didn\u2019t wake up one of the girls or call my mother in the middle of the night. It was just a normal thing that happened instead of an ordeal.", "NTA. You comforted a child who was upset about not understanding what happened to her. Sounds like your daughter made a good start on that work, too. There is zero reason a man can't talk about menstruation with a girl (except if it makes her uncomfortable, which is the opposite of this situation).\n\nHad it been one of my daughters, I would have been very grateful.\n\nThe mother should have prepared her daughter for this, and should definitely not lash out when all you did was comfort the kid.", "NTA! You did exactly what a responsible adult should have done in this situation. You calmed down a scared child. It sounds like you did well.", "NTA. You did the right thing based on what was happening at the moment. It sounds like this wasn\u2019t discussed beforehand by the mom and now she\u2019s taking it out on you. I\u2019ll say that I\u2019m all about reducing period stigma and it should be discussed more often then it already is, so I am a bit biased when it comes to this topic.", "NTA Not at all. Some people have a weird phobia in talking about menstruation, when they really shouldn't; as you say, it's a natural bodily process.\n\nAnd you had a crying girl on your hands. What else were you supposed to do in the moment? Leave her all anxious and crying until her mother could get there, or your wife? That would be ridiculous.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong w/what you did. You gave her the basic info, and calmed her down. Isn't that most important?", "Absolutely not.\n\nMaria is a sexist clown.", "Nta, good for you for showing her that it's ok for a man to know about this stuff and to be understanding about it. She'll know that any other response she receives from males in future isn't ok.", "NTA.", "NTA. To me it sounds as if you said exactly the right things at the right time. Yes, you are a male. Still, you are a member of the human race with a wife and a daughter, so you should know the basics. And most importantly, you reassured a terrified child.", "Yeah, agreeing with all the comments here, NTA. Maria's old-fashioned ideas are anti-feminist. If we want men to be more involved in the family life, we have to stop gatekeeping all those roles.", "NTA \n\nyou were the only adult around. What was important was making sure the kid is okay and not in bad pain or anything. If talking to her helped her calm down then you did the right thing. What does her mother expect you do to? Tell a crying kid to just wait another 30 minutes until a woman can do the talk?", "NTA. It is beyond me why people get so weird about women's cycles. Much like breastfeeding, it should be normalized in society, not a taboo subject.", "NTA\n\nOfc it would have been optimal if she'd gotten the chance to talk to her daughter about this. However there is absolutely nothing wrong with a friends parent (male or female) to talk about periods. \n\nIt's a normal body function in a healthy female body at certain ages. Can we just normalise that please.", "NTA - what did she want you to do? Ignore her frightened, crying child?! There is nothing wrong with what you did. You helped in a very appropriate way. Men should understand how a woman\u2019s body works and vice versa.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. There's no telling what \"Maria\" was thinking when she went off on you, but it was her responsibility to make sure her daughter knew to anticipate such a thing as her first menstrual cycle. Had she bothered to do the right thing by her daughter, you would not have likely found yourself in such an uncomfortable position. Kudos to you for stepping up and calming the poor girl as best you could.", "NTA, every person should be able to understand and talk about periods. They are a completely natural bodily occurrence. More so when she was upset, she would have needed to hear it from an adult at that age and I bet she was so embarrassed, poor thing. You definitely did the right thing.", "What were you supposed to do? Let the child panic until a woman showed up?", "NTA at all. I honestly believe a lot of controversy and misogynistic bull shot stems from men not understanding basic human biology, and women who feel shamed into hiding what, again, is basic biology. Because people aren't open to talking about periods and sex, reproductive health and risk, is what leads to adults not knowing their own bodies, not knowing when or how to ask for help, and why we have so much teen pregnancy, STDs, and people so unprepared for real world they become gender hating incels.", "NTA. Rather sexist behavior believing men should exclude themselves from their own daughters. And then she'll come back around and complain about her husband believing uninvolved with the kids.", "NTA at all. It was better you were able to calm her down than for her to freak out for a half an hour.", "NTA. Maria is embarrassed because she didn't prepare her daughter for a biological certainty, and she's taking out her frustration on OP.\n\nIt may be that Maria had a dream scenario where Julia got her first period and then Maria explained menstruation and she and Julia did some fancy women bonding... but Julia's uterus had a different schedule. It's not OP's fault that Julia got her first period at someone else's house, and it's not OP's fault that Julia was unprepared and freaked out. \n\nOP should get props for helping someone else's child through a (from Julia's perspective) health crisis and Maria should be ashamed she failed to prepare Julia for the inevitable.", "NTA. Honestly if more dudes were like this the world would be a much healthier place. It\u2019s bizarre to me that anyone would try to paint a supportive discussion as being inappropriate, because to ME it\u2019s weird and gross that any adult would view an 11yo CHILD\u2019s menstruation as being in any way sexual/taboo. The absolute best thing for menstruating people to learn is that it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about and having a period does NOT mean you are ready to be sexual or sexualized. You did a good thing for this kid and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re taking heat for it.", "NTA Julia was upset her mother is the asshole for not educating her daughter about her period . You were only trying to soothe and comfort her . You didn't do anything wrong Julia's mom should be angry with herself .", "NTA. Has this idiot not seen My Girl? She's just gonna leave her daughter to discover what a period is when she *wakes up covered in blood?!* Idiot.", "NTA. Good for you to handle it like a mature adult. I am a retired middle years teacher. As a male dealing with students from grade 6-8 over most of my career it is amazing how many students had parents that ignored this whole topic. Then when their daughter was experiencing menstruation for the first time and had little or incorrect knowledge(thanks social media!) they were in distress. I have two daughters so believe me these conversations have always been a part of our things we talked about as they were growing up. So they were ready emotionally/mentally/physically when it started for them. This is another reason that it does not hurt to have education cover matters like this. I would always let students know that if they needed to leave the classroom for this reason that it was fine. Or if they needed a friend to go with them that\u2019s fine. Being left to figure it out by yourself is not always the best. Oh wait, I live in a province that now allows parents to \u201copt out\u201d of sex education if it is violates their beliefs/religion/fear of their children being indoctrinated. So I suppose that\u2019s off the table now too.", "What?? No, you are absolutely NTA. Your handling of this was sensitive and commendable, and I\u2019m sure that child will remember this positively. If it was so important to mom that a woman talk to her about it, *she should have done so already*. I don\u2019t understand why some parents let it come as a nasty surprise and only explain after the first period. THAT is the asshole behaviour, poor kid.", "Ugh I hate when parents hold onto the narrative that the school has to teach these things to kids.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong at all NTA.  You didn\u2019t discuss more than saying it was normal and she was going to be ok.  Getting your period for the first time can be terrifying doubly so if you don\u2019t know it can happen.  Sure would your wife have had a better understanding of it 100% yes.  However she wasn\u2019t there and you were.  You did the right thing.  You didn\u2019t shame her or make her feel weird about it.", "NTA\n\n\nThat mother is in the wrong and is going to leave her daughter with some messed up beliefs. Thinking that a man knowing about menstruation or comforting a terrified little girl whose parents failed to prepare her for puberty is incredibly dated and sexist. If you had refused to help and waited for your wife, you would be TA because that little girl would have stayed panicked for at least half an hour longer than she did. Disappointed in that girl\u2019s mom for apparently never even telling her about what a period was or how to deal with it, getting your first period without having any prior education about it is super traumatic.", "NTA. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been inappropriate, but this was clearly an emergency. Sure, it's less than ideal, but biology rarely cares about people's preferred schedules.", "Putting myself in Julia\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d be freaked out if my friend\u2019s dad started talking to me about menstruation and the female body. It probably would have made the whole situation worse for me. \n\nI can see \u2018don\u2019t worry about anything or the mattress\u2019 talk, though. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re intentionally an AH though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her mom may be upset that she missed sharing that moment with her daughter, but she should have taught her much sooner.", "This mom clearly has things to figure out including how to tell their kid how life work she also is super sexist I'm a male and know how it works so she has social issues to figure out too and I do agree it was inappropriate but it had to be talked about to calm her down also his kid is a great friend and I'm sure of it because she tried to help and I respect it so no your not a AH the mom is", "NTA.  Shame on Maria for not preparing her daughter!! If she had done A PARENT\u2019S JOB of explaining to Julia the very normal changes that were about to happen to her body, she wouldn\u2019t have been freaking out at a friend\u2019s house thinking that she was dying, now would she?  You did exactly right by explaining to Julia what was happening and calming her down.  For f*ck\u2019s sake - someone had to.", "NTA, and I hate this idea some people have that menstruation is this secret thing men aren't supposed to know about.", "NTA. You were just trying to help. By the way her mother reacted, I don\u2019t really think she has anything against you, because it looks like she was scared. Maybe she doesn\u2019t trust men because of her past, and if that\u2019s the case it would be normal for her to be scared, especially for her daughter.", "NTA. and Maria needs to get caught up to current societal norms and the fact that fathers are perfectly fine discussing menstruation with their daughters and daughter's friends, especially when they are the only parent at home and a situation like arose like it did in your case.", "Absolutely NTA, given the situation it was reasonable for you as an adult who knows about it to calm down a clearly distressed child! Maria failed as a mother and chose to take it out on you I'm sorry OP. You did an amazing job and you should be proud that you were able to help a child who clearly didn't have a mother capable of preparing her child.\n\nI personally woke up to find out about my first period after having a nightmare where I was vomiting and expelling blood from multiple orifices and my hair was falling out. I felt pain and thought I was dying. I was in my own bed and yet I was terrified and crying at 12 years old. I couldn't imagine having my first period start at a friend's house. My own mother didn't shy away from telling me about her having periods but even then I didn't truly understand until it happened to me.", "NTA  you can't leave the poor kid panicking and honestly I think it's great that she had a man tell her it's normal.", "NTA her mom is a fuck nugget who couldn\u2019t be assed to teach or prepare her kid. You stood in and calmed the child, which is an appropriate thing to do when a child is freaking out. Then you called back up as soon as feasibly possible. She\u2019s just a crappy parent.", "NTA.  People need to get over themselves and realize it's okay to talk about periods.  Anyway her mother should have told her what was going to happen before it started.  You were just being a good guardian helping her calm down", "NTA. Her mother is a huge one", "NTA\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong.  It sounds like you treated it like it was a normal occurrence.   As it is!  \n\nThe AH here is Maria who never told her child about her changing body and didn\u2019t prepare her for menses onset.  Then to get upset because you are a man?  So what!  You are a human.", "NTA. Honestly, *more* men should be like you in these situations. It shows that you're attentive to other peoples needs and sympathetic to their situations - which are good qualities to have as a person.", "NTA, I would be grateful for help instead of sitting in pain and fear for that long", "\u201cMaria\u201d is the AH.  Girls are having periods at younger ages, it her own fault she didn\u2019t talk to her daughter.  And a man talking appropriately to said child is not crossing any lines.  He probably helped her more then her mother would have", "NTA. If the possibility that a man who is her same-aged, already-menstruating Girl friend's father, talks to the Girl AT ALL about Menstruation, upset this mother so much, then she REALLY shouldn't let her menarche-age daughter sleep over at a household that is KNOWN to contain a father, who ISN'T known to share her exact ideology about sex and gender segregation. Also it's very much abusive to \"shelter\" a Girl from basic biological information beyond the age where it applies to her practically, to the Point that she'll cry for 10 Minutes because she doesn't know what's going on. If she had raised her daughter properly and given her all the neccessary knowledge by age 9, she would have been MILDLY upset at the Most (because mattress), and wouldn't have needed you talking to her to calm down.", "NTA. You were the only adult around and your daughter asked you for help comforting her distraught friend. Sounds like you just tried to make her feel better and you quickly called women who could help (since they obviously know more about the topic). Maybe the mom is mad because she wasn\u2019t the one to talk to her, but the thing is bodies are unpredictable.", "NTA! It\u2019s a natural occurrence and there is nothing shameful about periods. Teaching your daughter to not talk about it in front of men of wrong.", "NTA! The first person I told was actually my little brother. I thought I was dying and asked him to run and get mom. I have had no idea what was happening. My mom came and sorted me out. Gave me the McDonalds she brought home from work and we all ate and moved on with lil jokes. \n\nWe still live in a society where men and boys shame those who have periods. They make us hide them. It's like a mission impossible secret mission every month. I hate it. People laugh at poop jokes and fart noises and yellow snow pee but an empty wrapped tampon package left out in plain sight is a sin to some. That's just too much they say. Pee on the seat? Whatever. Drop of blood? You are a demon that bleeds once a month and don't die. Evil! \n\nI'm glad that kid had a level headed adult that was calm to help her. You're a star for that. And I hate that I'm congratulating you on being kind to a child in distress but the bar is so fucking low on how people treat humans lately. So congrats indeed! \n\nI guess that mom was embarrassed. Probably thought she had more time to prepare some hallmark moment of entering womanhood or something. Who knows. Most of us do not get a talk before it happens. Periods are tricky. Some get them earlier now. I got mine at 9 I think. Hormones in foods have caused a lot of this. Schools rarely discuss it and well yeah. It's still taboo sadly. We hear older men in politics talk about women being able to survive a year's worth of periods with one jumbo box of tampons. Some of the shit I have heard from men about periods... I cringe. You are miles ahead of the game. Don't let that mom make you question what you did. You are NOT in the wrong.", "NTA", "NTA. In ideal circumstances, it would have been best for Maria or your wife to talk to her. These were not ideal circumstances, and you acted to help someone who needed it. Simple as that.", "NTA. What if you were a single dad? Would she just not let her daughter stay the night? You were the parent in charge at the moment so you did the parenting. We cannot ask men to care about these things and then get mad when they do.", "NTA; and her attitude is why so many men are completely in the dark about women\u2019s bodies.", "NTA at all. My daughter got her first period on a camping trip with my husband and son. They both rocked it, helping her remember all we'd talked about. My son was apparently quite the period coach. Normalizing this is incredibly important and this girl's first period could have been such a shame-laden experience if you'd reacted differently. You nailed it, and this mom should be ashamed of her reaction. Parents are there for kids, and when their parents aren't around, we're there for other kids, too.", "What. Ew. No. Absolutely NTA. Some men are gynaecologists for goodness sake. Others are single fathers. Some are gay men. Some mothers have never had a period themselves. Some men are trans and actually have personal experience of periods. Either way. It is a far healthier thing to have men who understand periods than not and you did the right thing settling down a very distressed child while your wife wasn't home. Julia's insecurities are her problem.", "NTA. You did everything right. If that was my daughter I would be very grateful. Maria is the one who fucked up by not having this conversation with her daughter BEFORE she started menstruating. Also for perpetuating the stigma around periods instead of treating them as what they are - perfectly natural, healthy, and nothing to be ashamed about (which is exactly how you treated it. Again, go you).", "Tell Maria that 2023 called and asked to remind her sexism isn't cool.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nTo some people, existing as a man in a situation with a child in a vulnerable state is cause for suspicion. It's not fair and often times it's not even a conscious bias.", "NTA. She needed an adult. Immediately. You supported her. Calmed her, and let her Mum know what happened. All completely appropriate. \nMum may be t a if she had not, prior to this point, explained to her daughter about menstruation and what to do when she started. I wander if Mum's anger is because an unrelated man did a better job of educating her daughter on womanhood than she did.", "Nta\nHell dude, you ever see the old sissy spacec movie, Carrie?\nWe actually _don't _ want to make kids going through that part of growing up feel alienated and alone", "NTA I find it so refreshing that you did that for her. I don\u2019t understand her Mother\u2019s attitudes at all.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly.", "NTA - getting your period at another persons house would have been scary and embarrassing for that little girl and by letting her know it was ok, normal and your daughter helping her would have made one of the most embarrassing days of her young life way easier.", "Obviously NTA at all. People like Maria frustrate me so much. Excuse me while I get on my soap box.\n\nPeople in society today want to complain that men aren\u2019t sensitive enough. Men don\u2019t know how to talk about feelings. Men should be just of comfortable staying home and caring for the kids and everything should be equal! AND YES I AGREE. But then when men like this TRY to just be a nurturing human being to a poor child, they get called out and made to feel nasty and dirty. And we wonder why more men aren\u2019t comfortable with childcare. \n\nI\u2019m a female btw lol. I\u2019m a school counselor and I hear comments frequently from people like Maria and it makes me SO MAD.", "You are absolutely NTA. \n\nBut Maria, on the other hand, could do with a Golden Buttplug Award.", "As a mom who had to have all the talks ( surprised me to  learn there were more than two lol) with my son because his own father refused, I would appreciate the crap out of you if that was my kid. Well, we would have already had that talk, unlike the mother here. But to calm her down and say what you said, and not act weird and like she\u2019s gross or something (like some men do) would mean the world to me. Nta", "NTA. You were helping a distressed child.", "Ok the asshole u should ask the parents if it\u2019s ok to tell her abo the subject u said \u201cI'm not an expert on this subject\u201d and many ask first and just tell her how to put it on hen call the mom or dad and tell the he/she/ they hats happening \n\nso the asshole  \n\nand the parents are also the assholes they should of already talke d about this with Julia so she knows what to do and what is is", "NTA\n\nMenstruation is not sexual. It is a normal bodily function for most adolescent girls and pre-menopausal women. It is nothing to be ashamed about, nothing that men are not supposed to talk about. As the father of a daughter who is already menstruating, it was your duty to be prepared, and as the only adult around at the time, it was your duty to help her. If she wasn't freaking out, it would have been fine to simply tell her not to worry, tell her where supplies were if your daughter hadn't already, and tell her not to worry about the sheets as you would take care of it. When she was freaking out, it was better to spend a little time talking to her to calm her down.\n\nHer mother is completely wrong for being upset with you. I hope she calms down. Since you are clearly a more mature adult than she is, and it's in the interest of both these girls for them to stay friends, it might be good for them if you offered an apology to Maria. You can tell the truth. You did not mean any harm, you are sorry that she is upset, and now you know that she is not okay with you talking about this to her daughter, you won't in the future.", "NTA. Julia's mother is, for not educating her daughter before a traumatic event.", "Definitely NTA, rather, you're a saint. You did exactly the correct thing. Poor kid will probably grow up with serious issues because of he super uptight mom.", "NTA this is Maria\u2019s fault for not talking to her daughter before this happened.", ">inappropriate for me to have talked to her daughter\n\nWell then, maybe HER parents should have warned her?\n\nShe was totally blindsided by her peroid.\n\nAlso, now she knows how a man SHOULD react to a peroid. Next time a man is weird about it, she will know that is not okay. \n\nNTA \n\nGood on you.", "NTA - you\u2019re a good man for doing that.", "Also, he has a daughter who has already gone through it so while he may not be the ideal person in this situation, he is a parent to a girl and understands the basics. It's part of life! It's not like he gave this girl the birds and the bees talk or something that could cross lines.", "This big time. I still remember being shouted at and punished by a (male) teacher because my friend had her period over lunch and so was still in the bathroom. She was just a bit late and wasn't sick enough to go to the nurse so just told me to tell the teacher until she could come to class when she was all sorted out. \n\nI was at an all girl's school as well, mind you. \n\nHe flipped out and screamed at me liked I'd burned him. \n\nWhy teach at an all girl's school (or any school) if you can't handle anything about periods? \n\nIt clearly made a mark because to this day it pisses me off when men get sensitive about period chat. It's why boyfriends get scared buying tampons for their girlfriends and stupid stuff like that. Many people get periods. That doesn't mean you have to shout about it willy nilly but gosh, it shouldn't make men feel like menstruating women are aliens you can only whisper about in the night. \n\nOP did the right thing.\n\nNTA", "I seriously think some women wait on purpose so that the child will never be confident in their womanhood.", "Yup, my mom always avoided the topic, thankfully my school taught me in natural science about reproduction, so when i had my first period suddenly at school in 6th grade, i didnt freak out, yes i was ashamed i stained my uniform but i was calm and after the rest of the kids left for gym i told the teacher. But thats because SOMEONE explained it to me BEFORE. \n\nNTA - Nothing about it was inapropiate, and if maria didnt want a man calming his child then she should have talked about it with her kid before. And i apretiate that a OP is mature and calm enought about it to calm down that poor kid, cause i know many immature guys who woulf freak out even worse about it.", "This. The mother should already have had a \"period talk\" with her daughter, this girl is 11 which means puberty is starting and menstruation is a part of it, many girls nowadays get their 1st period as soon as 9yo.

There\u2019s a good chance I\u2019m older than Maria and I am sitting here thinking WTF lady!", "Or some misguided \u201cpreserving innocence\u201d, as if periods affect innocence \ud83d\ude44", "Same thing happened to my grandmother, except she was at school. Went to the bathroom, discovered she was \u201cdying\u201d and then inconsolably ran for help thinking she needed an ambulance in front of everybody. \n\nHer mom just picked her up and laughed at her about it. 0 sympathy. Grandma made sure to teach my mom about her\u2019s as early as 9, and mom taught me at the same age for that reason too.", "To be honest, I'd consider not teaching your daughter about periods reasonably before she gets it to be a form of abuse. Any kid going through that and not knowing what is happening would be so traumatised, and it's inexcusable. I don't understand why so many people do that :/", "That happens so much. My aunt is an ER nurse in a really conservative area, she gets a couple girls a year who get their first period and think they're dying and won't hear otherwise from anybody who isn't in a white coat.", "I'm so sorry you went through that you must've been so frightened. \ud83d\ude12 \n\nMine didn't tell me either and also did the hiding thing. The only reason I wasn't scared when my periods did start was because I was a curious kid and had done a bit of information gathering.  But, this was in the 1980s and therefore pre- iinternet, so options were limited. My main sources were - the ONE book in my primary school library about puberty, plus Jackie magazine (UK) and a leaflet you could request from Tampax by sending off a coupon in said magazine. \n\nIt was a good thing I  was able to find out about body changes and periods from these sources because I had a sister (11 years older) who also told me absolutely NOTHING. She was a narcissist like my mother. When I was small she used to order me every few months to go to the local shop for her, armed with money and a note stating the name of the tampons she wanted. The lady in the shop would then whip them out from under the counter and straight into a paper bag to give to me \ud83e\udd74 . I can remember the look of embarrassment and annoyance on her face as clear as if it were yesterday . And it's about 40 years ago haha \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI am just so relieved that today's children and young people have more resources and that educators are - hopefully  - a bit more enlightened now. It was slowly starting to get a bit better by the late 80s / early 90s when I was at school . Or maybe it wasn't- when I was in the last year of primary school the head put a disposal bin for period products in the girls' toilets. But they only did that because the mum of the one girl who started her periods in primary school was a nurse and basically made them do that. That girl was my friend at the time so I knew the story. And, while he briefly explained what it was there for, he said we all had to go home and ask our mothers to tell us about periods  \n\nAt the same time, there is NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER for parents and guardians not to teach ALL of their children about puberty, periods and body changes etc. Along with all the social issues that kids and young people have to deal with. In an age appropriate way, from early childhood. There is literally no reason why they cant; even if they feel 'embarrassed' (in which case grow the hell up) or ill-equipped, there are any number of public health and charity resources and books to help them. \n\nI bought my niece a book on the subject when I could see she was starting puberty because I remembered what  my sister had been like with me when we were younger and I didn't want my niece to be uninformed (I did show  her mother the book first and she reacted positively).\n\nI'm case the OP thinks I've forgotten about him, sorry !...\n\nYou are absolutely completely positively and 100% NTA. The fact that you stepped in and immediately managed to soothe and comfort that poor young girl as well as give her the information she needed to cope at a horrible frightening time for her, speaks volumes about what a good father you are.  Just a good guy in general actually. \nIt's possible the extreme aggressive and blaming reaction of this woman is demonstrative of the guilt that she may be (should be) feeling. You were obviously an easy target for her to have a little tantrum and deflect her feelings about her cr*p parenting. I hope she apologises but I doubt she will, I know the type all too well.", "I got my period at 11, no one else in my class had got theirs, my mum grew up conservative and it was very hush hush. I ended up hiding my period, when my older sisters visited I stole their pads. I had horrible period pains but I didn't understand what was happening", "I got mine at 11 in a gas station bathroom and thought the same thing you did.  I thought I was dying and needed to go to the hospital", "Exactly. I remember that I was kept from wearing a bra as long as possible. I was wearing it at the first \u201csign\u201d and my mother asked me to stop and \u201cbe a little girl\u201d. I stopped for a few months and immediately started to wear it again. One day, I took it off after school and my mother saw me sitting in my room with my sister and screamed \u201cYou know you need a bra.

I'm so sorry you went through that!", "Iv been talking to my daughter about it recently and she\u2019s 8, cause she\u2019s had hair since like 6 and  I got my period at 9.

Literally my mom didnt even bother explaining that periods last for 4-5 days and then end. I thought it would continue forever. I dont even know tf her plan was. It was summer vacation. What if it happened at school?", "I'm so sorry you went through that. \n\nYou're completely right. We do need education regarding such matters in schools. Especially someone teaching **everyone** about periods and other matters as well and not just girls and stop acting as if its something to be embarrassed about.", "No, your question was \u2018who raised you to be uncomfortable with men?\u2019 And the answer is, no one, and I\u2019m not. \n\nBut speaking as a 13 year old girl bleeding on my friend\u2019s mattress? I would be. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree or even like it. But you shouldn\u2019t fill in your own blanks and make leaps like you did. But I get it\u2026Reddit\u2019s gonna Reddit.", "I think there was a problem in my family. I strongly suspect that a lot of people were autistic and had problems with executive functioning. Therefore, some distant relatives really would just sit down and let the pads overflow onto sheets and act as if it didn\u2019t even bother them. Because of this, my mother overreacted and would literally spank us or threaten to spank us for ruining a sheet because she assumed that we were doing the same thing that she saw growing up.", "That\u2019s so odd though, why would she do that? That sounds like it was actually kind of scary for a young kid. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s embarrassing at all, I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s up with your mom, lol. That\u2019s so shitty for presumably no reason.", "I learned about periods in a book before I got one, but I didn't quite understand what I read and also had that misconception for awhile. I think I figured it out before I actually got my period, but I don't remember for sure.

I know.. probably she found it odd to talk about 'such thigs' from a cultural point of view. I still remember I was in 7th grade then and wore bloomers ( Catholic school mandated it for girls)."]}
