She agreed and so did her mother (who I will call Maria). We have a friendly relationship with Maria where we exchange quick messages, we are not best friends, but we trust each other \n\nIt was agreed that Julia would stay from Friday night until Sunday afternoon and Maria would pick her up. \n\nToday, my wife went out to do some shopping and I stayed with the girls. \n\nMy daughter screamed my name and when I got close, she said that Julia was on her period and was crying and that she didn't know what to do. But she had taught her how to put on the pad (she already had her period). \n\nI'm not an expert on this subject, but I talked to her to calm her down, asking if it was hurting, if she was feeling anything and explaining that it was something natural in the female body and that there was nothing wrong. It was a good 10 minutes before she calmed down because she was apologizing because she had stained the mattress etc. \n\nAfter I saw that she relaxed, I called my wife to come to the house as soon as possible (to help me) and then I called Maria, explaining the situation and what I had done to help. \n\nShe was very rude and said she was coming to get her. \n\nWhen she arrived and Julia was in the car, she started saying that she thought it was inappropriate for me to have talked to her daughter and that it should have at least been my wife talking and not a man and that I crossed all possible boundaries. \n\nI tried to explain by saying that I just calmed down a child who had no idea what menstruation was and freaking out. She said that even so, me being the father of a friend of hers was not appropriate to have this type of conversation.\n\n She left an hour ago and I'm lost.

You did the right thing comforting her and talking to her about things her own mother clearly didn't. The conversation was **not** inappropriate in any way. Just because an old fashioned, sexist person thinks that periods are not to be discussed about or even mentioned by males does not make you an AH for helping someone.", "Nta. If Julia was okay talking to you, that\u2019s all that matters. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to have her sit there for 30 minutes scared if there was someone there who could calm her down sooner. The fact that your daughter is comfortable calling you for help with these matters shows you are good at handling sensitive issues just fine.", "You did the right thing. You helped out a distressed and upset child. The mother should have already had this chat with the girl before, so if she were to have her first period, it would not be such a freaky thing. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter what gender you are. If she has a problem because a male helped out, that's just sexist.\n\nNTA", "NTA you did the best you could to comfort an upset child. Yes the subject was a sensitive one but you appear to have handled it to the best of your ability without being inappropriate.\n\nShe can be upset but it doesn't appear justifiable from the story you told.", "Sounds like Maria has some extremely old fashioned ideas.\n\nNTA", "NTA. At some point everyone has to be able to talk about periods without shame or stigma (and that includes men with daughters/girls in their care, as was your case). Maria should have talked with her daughter about a year ago about this and normalized it for the kid so she didn\u2019t freak out at someone else\u2019s house, but hindsight is 20/20.", "NTA \n\nThe only asshole here is Maria who had never had that talk with her daughter, it\u2019s ridiculous that at 11 she didn\u2019t know about periods", "NTA but the mom was for not having the conversation with her daughter in the first place. She was at the age it could happen, this is on the mother for not educating her daughter.\n\n\nIf you had shown her how to put on a pad that would be crossing the line but that's not what happened. You explained it was natural and calmed her.  Good job being a better parent to someone else's kid.\n\nThe mother should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA - you were doing what you could to comfort a young girl who was panicking because she didn't understand why she was bleeding.\n\nYou simply told her it was natural and called your wife and Julia's mother.  Julia's mother owes you an apology, and one to her daughter for not preparing her for what was coming.", "NTA. It's stupid to say that only women can talk to about periods. You did the right thing and I'm sure if you were a woman and Julia was a little boy having some kind of boy problem that you knew about, you'd try to help them too.", "Poor girl. :-(\n\nI started my period at my best friend\u2019s house. All of the kids were in bed and I went to the bathroom and just sat on the toilet bleeding. Her dad was awake and when I didn\u2019t come out, he asked if I was alright, told me where the pads were and made me hot chocolate and sat up with me until I fell asleep on the couch. It was not weird at all. Of course, the two key differences here are that my mother had already provided me with the necessary information and I was very well acquainted with my bestie\u2019s dad; our families swapped children back and forth relatively frequently. So I can\u2019t say for certain that I would not have been mortified in a situation more like Julia\u2019s, but I do believe that his handling of it helped make an awful experience bearable and normalize something many people find taboo. I\u2019m grateful that he didn\u2019t wake up one of the girls or call my mother in the middle of the night. It was just a normal thing that happened instead of an ordeal.", "NTA. You comforted a child who was upset about not understanding what happened to her. Sounds like your daughter made a good start on that work, too. There is zero reason a man can't talk about menstruation with a girl (except if it makes her uncomfortable, which is the opposite of this situation).\n\nHad it been one of my daughters, I would have been very grateful.\n\nThe mother should have prepared her daughter for this, and should definitely not lash out when all you did was comfort the kid.", "NTA! You did exactly what a responsible adult should have done in this situation. You calmed down a scared child. It sounds like you did well.", "NTA. You did the right thing based on what was happening at the moment. It sounds like this wasn\u2019t discussed beforehand by the mom and now she\u2019s taking it out on you. I\u2019ll say that I\u2019m all about reducing period stigma and it should be discussed more often then it already is, so I am a bit biased when it comes to this topic.", "NTA Not at all. Some people have a weird phobia in talking about menstruation, when they really shouldn't; as you say, it's a natural bodily process.\n\nAnd you can a crying girl on your hands. What else were you supposed to do in the moment? Leave her all anxious and crying until her mother could get there, or your wife? That would be ridiculous.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong w/what you did. You gave her the basic info, and calmed her down. Isn't that most important?", "Absolutely not.\n\nMaria is a sexist clown.", "Nta, good for you for showing her that it's ok for a man to know about this stuff and to be understanding about it. She'll know that any other response she receives from males in future isn't ok.", "NTA.", "NTA. To me it sounds as if you said exactly the right things at the right time. Yes, you are a male. Still, you are a member of the human race with a wife and a daughter, so you should know the basics. And most importantly, you reassured a terrified child.", "Yeah, agreeing with all the comments here, NTA. Maria's old-fashioned ideas are anti-feminist. If we want men to be more involved in the family life, we have to stop gatekeeping all those roles.", "NTA \n\nyou were the only adult around. What was important was making sure the kid is okay and not in bad pain or anything. If talking to her helped her calm down then you did the right thing. What does her mother expect you do to? Tell a crying kid to just wait another 30 minutes until a woman can do the talk?", "NTA. It is beyond me why people get so weird about women's cycles. Much like breastfeeding, it should be normalized in society, not a taboo subject.", "NTA\n\nOfc it would have been optimal if she'd gotten the chance to talk to her daughter about this. However there is absolutely nothing wrong with a friends parent (male or female) to talk about periods. \n\nIt's a normal body function in a healthy female body at certain ages. Can we just normalise that please.", "NTA - what did she want you to do? Ignore her frightened, crying child?! There is nothing wrong with what you did. You helped in a very appropriate way. Men should understand how a woman\u2019s body works and vice versa.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. There's no telling what \"Maria\" was thinking when she went off on you, but it was her responsibility to make sure her daughter knew to anticipate such a thing as her first menstrual cycle. Had she bothered to do the right thing by her daughter, you would not have likely found yourself in such an uncomfortable position. Kudos to you for stepping up and calming the poor girl as best you could.", "NTA, every person should be able to understand and talk about periods. They are a completely natural bodily occurrence. More so when she was upset, she would have needed to hear it from an adult at that age and I bet she was so embarrassed, poor thing. You definitely did the right thing.", "What were you supposed to do? Let the child panic until a woman showed up?", "NTA at all. I honestly believe a lot of controversy and misogynistic bull shot stems from men not understanding basic human biology, and women who feel shamed into hiding what, again, is basic biology. Because people aren't open to talking about periods and sex, reproductive health and risk, is what leads to adults not knowing their own bodies, not knowing when or how to ask for help, and why we have so much teen pregnancy, STDs, and people so unprepared for real world they become gender hating incels.", "NTA. Rather sexist behavior believing men should exclude themselves from their own daughters. And then she'll come back around and complain about her husband believing uninvolved with the kids.", "NTA at all. It was better you were able to calm her down than for her to freak out for a half an hour.", "NTA. Maria is embarrassed because she didn't prepare her daughter for a biological certainty, and she's taking out her frustration on OP.\n\nIt may be that Maria had a dream scenario where Julia got her first period and then Maria explained menstruation and she and Julia did some fancy women bonding... but Julia's uterus had a different schedule. It's not OP's fault that Julia got her first period at someone else's house, and it's not OP's fault that Julia was unprepared and freaked out. \n\nOP should get props for helping someone else's child through a (from Julia's perspective) health crisis and Maria should be ashamed she failed to prepare Julia for the inevitable.", "NTA. Honestly if more dudes were like this the world would be a much healthier place. It\u2019s bizarre to me that anyone would try to paint a supportive discussion as being inappropriate, because to ME it\u2019s weird and gross that any adult would view an 11yo CHILD\u2019s menstruation as being in any way sexual/taboo. The absolute best thing for menstruating people to learn is that it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about and having a period does NOT mean you are ready to be sexual or sexualized. You did a good thing for this kid and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re taking heat for it.", "NTA Julia was upset her mother is the asshole for not educating her daughter about her period . You were only trying to soothe and comfort her . You didn't do anything wrong Julia's mom should be angry with herself .", "NTA. Has this idiot not seen My Girl? She's just gonna leave her daughter to discover what a period is when she *wakes up covered in blood?!* Idiot.", "NTA. Good for you to handle it like a mature adult. I am a retired middle years teacher. As a male dealing with students from grade 6-8 over most of my career it is amazing how many students had parents that ignored this whole topic. Then when their daughter was experiencing menstruation for the first time and had little or incorrect knowledge(thanks social media!) they were in distress. I have two daughters so believe me these conversations have always been a part of our things we talked about as they were growing up. So they were ready emotionally/mentally/physically when it started for them. This is another reason that it does not hurt to have education cover matters like this. I would always let students know that if they needed to leave the classroom for this reason that it was fine. Or if they needed a friend to go with them that\u2019s fine. Being left to figure it out by yourself is not always the best. Oh wait, I live in a province that now allows parents to \u201copt out\u201d of sex education if it is violates their beliefs/religion/fear of their children being indoctrinated. So I suppose that\u2019s off the table now too.", "What?? No, you are absolutely NTA. Your handling of this was sensitive and commendable, and I\u2019m sure that child will remember this positively. If it was so important to mom that a woman talk to her about it, *she should have done so already*. I don\u2019t understand why some parents let it come as a nasty surprise and only explain after the first period. THAT is the asshole behaviour, poor kid.", "Ugh I hate when parents hold onto the narrative that the school has to teach these things to kids.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong at all NTA.  You didn\u2019t discuss more than saying it was normal and she was going to be ok.  Getting your period for the first time can be terrifying doubly so if you don\u2019t know it can happen.  Sure would your wife have had a better understanding of it 100% yes.  However she wasn\u2019t there and you were.  You did the right thing.  You didn\u2019t shame her or make her feel weird about it.", "NTA\n\n\nThat mother is in the wrong and is going to leave her daughter with some messed up beliefs. Thinking that a man knowing about menstruation or comforting a terrified little girl whose parents failed to prepare her for puberty is incredibly dated and sexist. If you had refused to help and waited for your wife, you would be TA because that little girl would have stayed panicked for at least half an hour longer than she did. Disappointed in that girl\u2019s mom for apparently never even telling her about what a period was or how to deal with it, getting your first period without having any prior education about it is super traumatic.", "NTA. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been inappropriate, but this was clearly an emergency. Sure, it's less than ideal, but biology rarely cares about people's preferred schedules.", "Putting myself in Julia\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d be freaked out if my friend\u2019s dad started talking to me about menstruation and the female body. It probably would have made the whole situation worse for me. \n\nI can see \u2018don\u2019t worry about anything or the mattress\u2019 talk, though. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re intentionally an AH though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He just did what any good parent would: took care of a child in his care. \n\nMy girls are still very little, but if one of them were to start her period unexpectedly at someone else\u2019s house, I\u2019d hope they\u2019d be as comforting and supportive as OP.
