They seem content letting their kid pay all the expenses for them and for your brother. They're not supporting him at all. Your parents aren't sacrificing anything for you or your brother at this point.", "NTA. You are  hero!!! Bravo!!", "ESH,\nYour parents definitely suck for trying to do the same thing to your brother. But you also suck for strong arming them. If you\u2019re just going to use the support you\u2019ve given them against them, why bother in the first place? Also, it\u2019s high school, so he\u2019s a minor. You\u2019re not his parent . So you overstepped in that regard.", "YTA. it was AH move when they did it to you and its AH move when you are doing it to them.  your motives are seemingly more Nobel since you want your brother to have his freedom.  The same way beating your abusive parent to show them they are no longer the one with power is an AH move, even if its not a bad move.   \nI have no way of knowing what your brother needs in his life, taking their advice will not be good for him but going down your path might also not work.   \n\n\nI'm not saying not to do it but it is one of those things were you only retroactively be able to tell if it was the right call.  In general I would suggest not taking their advice on anything if they failed at life, my own parents did not amount to anything but you can bet your butt they loved acting like experts.", "ESH\n\nYour parents teaching philosophies are old school and you want your brother to have it better. That's commendable. This is something you can discuss and reason with your parents.\n\nYour parents lost their jobs, and you help them. That's commendable. I don't know if that's rare or common in your country to help financially the elders once you're working. Nevertheless, great that you do.\n\nThe problem comes when you put these two things against each other. You can better help your parents and your brother when you don't make threats and ultimatums. Also, if they've grown in a culture where this linear career path is ingrained, it takes time to turn that ship's course. You can help your brother with patience. You can still turn this around when you explain this to your parents.", "NTA. I commend you for standing up for your brother. Your parents are clearly in the wrong.

Yeah HUGE(trump's voice) sacrifice.\n\nGood for you for standing by your brother.  They didn't sacrifice for you.  Sacrificing would have going out of their way to make sure you lived your dreams, not forcing you to live theirs.  \n\nPlus until you are an adult, they are responsible for your care.

I don't know your culture. I think your parents over stepped in both you and your brother education / job desires. You didn't have to move back in with them during COVID and now it is over (at least where I am). Time to move back no matter what else is going on. I think it is great you stood up for your brother and hope when you get settled back in your place you continue to support him.

Stand up for your brother I was in the same situation and my parents were trying to make decisions that were bad for my little bros I put my foot down and said NO you live with me and I won\u2019t finance this. Needless to say my bros are doing well and always thank me for doing what they couldn\u2019t do. As for the relatives they need to mind there own business if you let this slide you will be a slave with no respect. Sometimes you need to be a major AH for these type of people to understand.", "NTA you did right by your brother to stand up for him and his wishes. Also, you do not owe your parents anything and are not being ungrateful. You did not choose to be born, they chose to have children. They knew that there would be sacrifices they would have to make in order to give you a good life. It's part of being a proper parent. It is not your responsibility to pay them back in some way for everything they did to provide for you.", "NTA\n\n Money comes with expectations", "NTA, good thing you support your brother ! You're great for that, it's the best thing to do and he will be happier in life thanks to you\nAnd in fact, you're paying the bills and you don't have to, so that's a good way to threaten them I think\nAs an advise, I can just say continue and talk to your brother. Maybe he can convince them (or you can speak to them about it) that it's a good idea, and that his choice is a good one", "NTA.  Advice?
