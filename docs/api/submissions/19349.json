I am a single mom who works full time in the legal field, and my sister is married to a professional athlete (major sports - think NFL/NBA/MLB); she's mostly a stay at home mom, but she's been pretty successful being a part-time realtor.\n\nTo be frank - as the baby of the family, my sister literally has never needed to worry about anything; money, housing, putting food on the table, etc. Because of the above, my sister has kind of an uppity/privileged attitude. \n\nEvery time I hang out with her, she is constantly disciplining my son/putting him in timeout if he does not immediately comply with her commands. Most of the time, he's literally just being a 3 year old (not doing anything mean/unsafe). His teachers at daycare constantly tell me how great of listener he is, how polite he is, etc, so that further cements my belief that she is way too overbearing on him. She has made comments about my status as a single mother, and how she believes that affects my ability to be an effective parent.\n\nIt all came to a head yesterday when we both were visiting our parents. My sister & I also hung out last weekend and through Wednesday, so I'd been dealing with her undermining me/scoffing/making slick comments all week. Thoughout the evening, she continued to make several comments of disapproval about my parenting, in front of my son. She randomly turned off a movie my son and I were watching to put something on for my niece (who wasnt paying attention), and then stormed out of the room saying \"you're just teaching him that he gets what he wants if he cries\" upon me telling her to turn it back on??\n\nAs we were leaving, she again inappropriately disciplined my overtired, and cranky 3 year old (it was well past his bedtime & he was actually asking to leave lol); I told her to stop, and she said something to the effect of \"if you're not gonna discipline him I will\". \n\nAt that point, I'd had enough. I went ballistic on her, in front of everyone. I pretty much said every cuss word in the book, told her I can't wait til my niece is a toddler so I can laugh right in her face when she learns that toddlers are not rational, emotionally/mentally developed tiny humans. I told her I'm done with her demonizing my son, and I'm done with her turning her entitled ass nose up at me when she won't even take my niece to the store b/c it's \"too much\". I scooped up my son and basically ran out of the house. \n\nOnce I calmed down a bit on the way home, I felt absolutely horrible that I exploded like that in front of my son & parents. I explained to my son that \"mommy was feeling angry, but it was not okay for mommy to yell.\" I'm still super pissed at my sister though, and I'm not responding to her texts/calls. She says I'm overreacting.\n\nMom said I need to just \"let it go\". My dad is siding with me.

Heck, blame her for everything. But also keep in mind what you're teaching him: not only is it okay to let other people disrespect your boundaries,  but you won't protect him when they do. So you need to start being a responsible parent and cut your sister off until she can stop undermining your parenting. If your parents disagree,  cut them off too.\n\nVery gentle ESH.

Doing your best.\n\nI saw in your comments that you\u2019ve spoken to your sister multiple times about her behavior, but you\u2019re still constantly exposing your son to her. \n\nYou\u2019re not showing him that mom sticks up for him, you\u2019re showing him that no matter how many times your sister oversteps boundaries, she\u2019ll still be allowed access to him. \n\nThat no matter how she makes him feel and even when mom says stop, she\u2019ll still be around and still commit the same actions with 0 consequences.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for finally losing it. But I think one of the reasons you lost it is because you aren\u2019t giving her consequences. \u201cSis if you overstep again, we will leave and won\u2019t see you for two weeks\u201d \u201cSis, I\u2019ve already told you what\u2019s going to happen, I will not be responding to texts or calls until you apologize\u201d same thing for your mom.\n\nI get that your sister is your best friend. I have a little sister too (that I adore). But if my sister/best friend continuously overstepped and refused to see the issues they would not have easy access to me. I don\u2019t have children so I\u2019m not going to pretend, but if they were overstepping and ridiculing my partner, once again I\u2019d give them boundaries and the follow through.\n\nI know you said in comments that you\u2019re not meek or mild (and that\u2019s great! Strong confident!) but you are continuously letting her stomp all over your boundaries and your sons\u2019. You may not be quiet about it, but you\u2019re not doing anything about it either.\n\nAlso you said that you reprimand her outside of your son\u2019s hearing? So he doesn\u2019t even see you stepping up for him, all he knows is that mom will constantly expose him to unfair standards and ridicule. \n\nAgain, OP you sound like a loving and emotionally aware and in tune parent.

Allowing this is being an AH to your kid.\n\n>It all came to a head yesterday when we both were visiting our parents. My sister & I also hung out last weekend and through Wednesday, so I'd been dealing with her undermining me/scoffing/making slick comments all week. Thoughout the evening, she continued to make several comments of disapproval about my parenting, in front of my son. She randomly turned off a movie my son and I were watching to put something on for my niece (who wasnt paying attention), and then stormed out of the room saying \"you're just teaching him that he gets what he wants if he cries\" upon me telling her to turn it back on?\n\nWhy do you continue to hang out with her? Something tells me you have a need for this sort of drama. You might want to get that checked. If you want to be polite and get the message across, when someone without kids tries to critique your parenting, ask them for the peer reviewed research that supports their claim. Never take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from. Now you're being an AH to yourself.\n\n>At that point, I'd had enough. I went ballistic on her, in front of everyone. I pretty much said every cuss word in the book, told her I can't wait til my niece is a toddler so I can laugh right in her face when she learns that toddlers are not rational, emotionally/mentally developed tiny humans. I told her I'm done with her demonizing my son, and I'm done with her turning her entitled ass nose up at me when she won't even take my niece to the store b/c it's \"too much\". I scooped up my son and basically ran out of the house. \n\nThis is where you become the AH to everyone around you.

You know it was inappropriate to yell like that in front of them and your child.\n\nSecond: Tell your mother you will let it go when you receive an apology from your sister for constantly undermining your parenting, for deliberately being antagonistic towards your son, and for being downright rude and somewhat misogynistic towards your nature of being a single mother.\n\nI want to say NTA op, but its close to E S H for blowing up in front of the kids.", "Mom has also been watching \"Frozen\" too much. \n\nYour sister has been sticking her nose where it's not need or welcome, and she needs to knock it off.  Dad is write.\n\nNTA", " I choose to be optimist, and interprete mom's \" let it go\", as \" no need to apologise to your sister for anything\". NTA", "Ditto. Keep your hands off my tiny spawns!!", "Yeah no - I am supposed to speak with her tonight, and if she doesn't apologize and agree to stop with the comment/overstepping my boundaries, we are not hanging out again and she will not be allowed around my son.", "Oh wow! Why do you think she would be jealous of me? I'm not perceiving jealousy from her, but am interested to hear your perspective.", "Wow, I really appreciate your thorough response with constructive criticism.  Thank you for taking the time to respond. The reason I reprimand her out of earshot, is \n1. To tell her how to correctly discipline according to my standards , and to stop doing what she's doing; sometimes this involves cuss words lol and 2. Sometimes, there are a few things she \"disciplines\"/talks to him for, that are valid - it is just the way she handles it is not how I would have. \n\nI tried not to undermine her directly while my son is present, because I don't want him to think he doesn't have to respect her, but at the same time she will no longer be given any opportunity to discipline at all as we will not be hanging with her if she does not change her behavior. If she does change her behavior, then I wouldn't want my son thinking he \"doesn't have to listen\" to her since she's not his mom, if she changes her discipline to be in alignment with mine.", "I would agree with you, except for the fact that there is not a CHANCE I'm apologizing to my sister lol the only thing she will receive is an acknowledgement that I yelled, and only after *she* apologizes to me lol", "Lmao \"my brat\". I'm assuming the contraption over the head and face of your avatar is most likely worn in real life? Not very smart, you are.", "You did well\n You need to stand up for your little boy.\nNTA.", "Lmaoooooo oh come back for the update!!!!!", "Hi! Of course and thank you for being so receptive and for the additional information.\n\nI totally understand not wanting to give your son the impression that he\u2019s allowed to disrespect her.\n\nHowever, is the way she\u2019s acting even deserving of his respect? Even when she reprimands him for something that you would have, she does it in an non constructive manner/against your parenting techniques.\n\n It\u2019s obviously one thing if he\u2019s about to run into the street (which isn\u2019t the case here) it\u2019s another thing when she\u2019s honestly, just being nasty. \n\nI used to be a teacher and trust me, I get how 3 year olds can be. However, I think it\u2019s important to sit down with your son and in an age appropriate way ask him \u201chow do you feel when auntie talks to you this way (with examples)? Can you draw me a picture of how you\u2019re feeling about auntie? When auntie says *insert this* to you, how do you feel? Can you draw it for me?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019ll help gauge the impact she\u2019s having on your son. I\u2019m fully onboard with not being around her until she shows change. However, she has to actually show change consistently. \n\nMy biggest worry for you OP is if he\u2019s ever alone with her, what she\u2019ll say and what he\u2019ll feel he has to keep secret. \n\nShe is your best friend and no kid wants to hurt their parent. I know you\u2019re saying that she won\u2019t be alone with him, but your mother doesn\u2019t respect your thoughts or boundaries. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you dropped your son off with them and she came over. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make mommy sad! So auntie coming over is a secret, ok? You don\u2019t want to make mommy angry and never see grandma again!\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re a single mom doing an AMAZING JOB. I super want to stress this. But it can be really hard to see how harmful family can actually be sometimes.", "Lol, she doesn't really deserve an apology, I just thought the conversation might go smoother. Good luck with everything. I'm sure you're a great mom!", "Thanks.  To be fair, the reason that I remember those specific times is because they weren't the norm for me. My parents were always clear and fair and they did not tolerate mistreatment of their kids by others.", "I really appreciate that, kind internet stranger. It bothered me a lot when I was younger, but fortunately for me I have two parents - and I was and still am my dad's \"favorite\" :) so, he is usually the one who takes my side when there is an issue. And sometimes not, when I am wrong- which I appreciate him even more so for doing.", "Yup, that dynamic has absolutely played through my family as well.", "Hoping for an update!!!", "My mom just automatically tends to side with my sister  - right or wrong. That is where my dad and I differ from mom/sister, amongst other things. If you are wrong, you are wrong. We don't just automatically take sides.", "Haha \"nevering\" bigger than they've ever \"nevered\" before lmfaooo I love this", "NTA \n\nIgnore your mom and put your sister in time out. Why subject yourself to this kind of treatment from the Golden Child? I'd just stay away from her.", "How much does your mom benefit from your sisters life style? I'm guessing there are some perks of having a daughter who's a \"WAGS\". Your dad knows the truth of your sisters behaviour toward your son. I wouldn't leave your mom alone with him if you can help it, she clearly has favourites. \n\nNTA", "Thank you for listing the ages of your cats.", "HAHA! Even that sarcastic \"apology\", I can't muster up. There's no way \"I'm sorry\" or \"I apologize\" is ever coming out of my mouth to her, in regards to this situation - even if it's not a real apology haha", "0; regardless of my qualms with my family, we are not like that. My mom has always sided with my sister, and \"favored\" her since forever. Also, just because we are all aware that my sister's Husband is obv a professional athlete, we're all like, normal people lol. We don't ask them for money or anything like that, nor does anyone in my family. My parents own their own home, and I have my own stuff, and also even if we didn't - not their responsibility to provide it.\n\nI don't know if you had a chance to see my other comment; but, my mom watched my son until he was about 1- 1 1/2, as I am a single mom and couldn't afford daycare at the time (he's in that now). My son and mom are almost inseparable, he likes her more than me lol. And my mom does NOT agree that he is \"misbehaved\". She just does not and will not speak up against my sister most times, and always says \"just let it go, TheCoolMomofDom, it's not that serious\".", "I was sharing a hotel once during a convention. The last day of con I got sick and just wanted to stay in the room and watch the closed feed of panels from the convention on the TV. A \"friend\" and her mom came over to OUR room that she was not part of sharing to I guess wait for the others to come back before lunch. I was in bed, they knew I was not feeling well and really wanted to watch the panel that was currently going on (Lord of the Rings actors). I got up to go to the bathroom for a quick trip and they turned the TV off on me. The bathroom wasn't down the hall, it's a hotel room, I could still HEAR the TV. I asked WTF and her mom said I wasn't watching so she turned it off \"to conserve energy\" and I could turn it on when I got back in bed. \n\nSo your sister turning off the movie to turn on something for HER kid *really* got to me. Sweet Jesus you are NTA and I'd just.... not be around her anymore.", "Yeah 1 year old's will watch anything, your sister was being an AH. NTA since she had it coming.", "Sometimes it\u2019s not about asking for money or gifts it\u2019s lunches together or shopping days you may not be apart of. She clearly has a favorite if she thinks your child being berated by your sister isn\u2019t that serious.", "Um........what the HECK?! That's almost worst than what my sister did hahaha at least one could make the argument that since we were at a neutral location (parents house), nobody really had \"authority\" over the TV except my parents...but your \"friend\" hijacking your hotel room and turning your tv off when you got up? To \"conserve energy\"? For.....the hotel? Lol what was 11 seconds worth of energy going to do hahaha oh my god I would have been incensed... that's nuts lol", "Yeah, I mean it would....but...I'm feeling very \"  >:)  \" right now haha", "NTA, your sister sounds insufferable. You were more patient than I could have been.\n\nI would completely avoid her.", "I'm not sure how you've explained it, but for most normal people a simple, \"He's not your son, it's not your place, leave him alone\" will suffice.  And it sounds that's basically what you said, and your sister should have backed off immediately at that point.  As most people recognize that line, you don't parent/discipline other people's children.", "NTA\n\nOne of the most destructive behaviors is bullying, especially adult to child. And, you don't expect the person you grew up with and love to bully your child. I think it's doubly shocking when that happens, and I can understand there's going to be some adult to adult yelling. In fact, most times, yelling is the only way the message gets through, finally!\n\nI loved my children at three: it's such a \"big eyes, funny, loving, active\" age. The acme of toddlerhood. Actually, each age and stage has been a privilege to live through with my children. Love and sense guide us.\n\nThis message is from another single parent. We do good work, OP. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA.  Please stop letting your sister discipline your son.  It's  not her place and I would tell her that.  Tell her that brats come from a couple household so her criticizing your parenting is hypocritical.", "NTA.\n\nWhether or not your reaction was appropriate (I think it was though), your sister was extremely out of line and deserved it.\n\nTell mom that if she's telling you to let it go, she'd better also be telling your sister to keep her stupid mouth shut.", "It seems she lets her daughter whine and complain until she gets her way, yet she will accuse her nephew of that.   Dad sees right through that.", "I like Dad.  OP seems pretty cool too.\n\nSister seems entitled.  Marrying into wealth has not done her any favors.  I think Mom values the marrying into wealth better than the hard working, not asking for handouts daughter.", "Thanks!i was curious is all. Sister would have been the AH either way,  but i wanted to make sure i didn't say something she already did", "Your mom not defending your son is also a sign of disrespect to you and your son. Your son is only three years old, he\u2019s unable to defend himself and yet his own grandmother is letting it slide. He needs the adults in his life to support and stand behind him, if they are unable to do that then I think it\u2019s best to set boundaries and make it clear that they should be supporting the child and not the giant toddler they raised.", "Honestly OP, is there a way you can limit your time with her? At least to the best you can because i understand it's not 100% possible sometimes", "NTA You were standing up for your kid. It's one thing for a different adult to discipline your child (it does take a village to raise a child after all), but they should follow the lead of the parent. Your sister needed to be put in her place. Admitting to your son that the way you acted wasn't acceptable was a good touch as well. Teaching them humility will only ever help them in life", "No you are not. You were actually good. The first time she tried to discipline my son would have been her last. Me, I'd break her face but that's me. I have a sister who tried that it took one time she never did it again. Don't mess with my kids, you take care of yours and I'll take care of mine. If my child is watching something don't think about changing it for yours. I can't stand entitled people. His makes my blood boil. I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks.", "Nta (maybe a little for waiting so long). Glad your dad got it right, just gross your mom is only feeding into the behavior & entitlement. And just so you know, thats momma bear syndrome. Don't feel bad about it at all, it comes along with motherly instincts & is there for exactly this- protecting our young. Its twisted your sister would ever think this is ok. Ask her how she would feel if someone came at her child like that. For being a child.", "Your dad is right", "\u201cExpose the kid to conflict so he knows you love him.\u201d \n\nFuck outta here. You aren\u2019t a parent.", "Your mom enabling your sister likely has a lot to do with money. Do they go on lunch dates a lot? Does your sister pay for them to get mani-pedis? Trips to the mall where your sister pays with NFL guy\u2019s money? \n\nCall your mom on her bullshit before it gets worse. Good on your dad for not being a tool.", "Sister needs an ego check, make sure to tell her that. That usually makes people step the fuck back and think about how they've been acting in my experience.", "That's why I phrased it \"I wonder\" because there is no evidence in what you said. Glad he is a decent guy. Sorry your sister has issues."]}
