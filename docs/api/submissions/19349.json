I am a single mom who works full time in the legal field, and my sister is married to a professional athlete (major sports - think NFL/NBA/MLB); she's mostly a stay at home mom, but she's been pretty successful being a part-time realtor.\n\nTo be frank - as the baby of the family, my sister literally has never needed to worry about anything; money, housing, putting food on the table, etc. Because of the above, my sister has kind of an uppity/privileged attitude. \n\nEvery time I hang out with her, she is constantly disciplining my son/putting him in timeout if he does not immediately comply with her commands. Most of the time, he's literally just being a 3 year old (not doing anything mean/unsafe). His teachers at daycare constantly tell me how great of listener he is, how polite he is, etc, so that further cements my belief that she is way too overbearing on him. She has made comments about my status as a single mother, and how she believes that affects my ability to be an effective parent.\n\nIt all came to a head yesterday when we both were visiting our parents. My sister & I also hung out last weekend and through Wednesday, so I'd been dealing with her undermining me/scoffing/making slick comments all week. Thoughout the evening, she continued to make several comments of disapproval about my parenting, in front of my son. She randomly turned off a movie my son and I were watching to put something on for my niece (who wasnt paying attention), and then stormed out of the room saying \"you're just teaching him that he gets what he wants if he cries\" upon me telling her to turn it back on??\n\nAs we were leaving, she again inappropriately disciplined my overtired, and cranky 3 year old (it was well past his bedtime & he was actually asking to leave lol); I told her to stop, and she said something to the effect of \"if you're not gonna discipline him I will\". \n\nAt that point, I'd had enough. I went ballistic on her, in front of everyone. I pretty much said every cuss word in the book, told her I can't wait til my niece is a toddler so I can laugh right in her face when she learns that toddlers are not rational, emotionally/mentally developed tiny humans. I told her I'm done with her demonizing my son, and I'm done with her turning her entitled ass nose up at me when she won't even take my niece to the store b/c it's \"too much\". I scooped up my son and basically ran out of the house. \n\nOnce I calmed down a bit on the way home, I felt absolutely horrible that I exploded like that in front of my son & parents. I explained to my son that \"mommy was feeling angry, but it was not okay for mommy to yell.\" I'm still super pissed at my sister though, and I'm not responding to her texts/calls. She says I'm overreacting.\n\nMom said I need to just \"let it go\". My dad is siding with me.

As long as they are not endangering themselves (6V) my daughter (6F), my cats (8M/8F/3M) or my legos (too many to list) , they can do pretty much what they want.

Which boils down to this: your child won't learn how to respect and listen to you if he sees other adults disrespecting and overruling you. \n\nTell your sister that if your son is disrespectful,  it's because she's modeling disrespectful behavior. Heck, blame her for everything. But also keep in mind what you're teaching him: not only is it okay to let other people disrespect your boundaries,  but you won't protect him when they do. So you need to start being a responsible parent and cut your sister off until she can stop undermining your parenting. If your parents disagree,  cut them off too.\n\nVery gentle ESH. Your son is 3, and it's time for you to put boundaries in place. Your sister doesn't get to command him, and if she thinks he needs a timeout she needs to defer to you.

Too often here you get stories like \"a little kid came up and tried to steal my lunch.  When I said \"hey, friend, don't do that\" his mom went ballistic.  AITA?\"\n\nThat said, from your description it sounds like your sister's a grade-A Asshole and is being absolutely ridiculous.

I am not a meek and mild person, so every time she has done this I've very clearly and sternly told her to..... fuck off, lol. But not in front of my son, like this time. I guess until recently, she's kind of made me feel like maybe I'm not seeing my son's behavior? I don't wanna be *that* mom that thinks their kid is just an absolute angel all the time. He is definitely not, but he's certainly not a wild child like she portrays.\n\nIt's tough though, because I wouldn't mind my sister reinforcing MY rules/parenting style, but mostly she does want SHE feels is the correct way, obviously.
