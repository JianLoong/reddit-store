{"id": 19349, "submission_id": "144vkdu", "title": "AITA for cussing out my sister in front of everyone?", "selftext": "\nFor context; my (26F) sister (25F) both have young children; I have a 3 year old son, she has a 1 year old daughter. I am a single mom who works full time in the legal field, and my sister is married to a professional athlete (major sports - think NFL/NBA/MLB); she's mostly a stay at home mom, but she's been pretty successful being a part-time realtor.\n\nTo be frank - as the baby of the family, my sister literally has never needed to worry about anything; money, housing, putting food on the table, etc. Because of the above, my sister has kind of an uppity/privileged attitude. \n\nEvery time I hang out with her, she is constantly disciplining my son/putting him in timeout if he does not immediately comply with her commands. Most of the time, he's literally just being a 3 year old (not doing anything mean/unsafe). His teachers at daycare constantly tell me how great of listener he is, how polite he is, etc, so that further cements my belief that she is way too overbearing on him. She has made comments about my status as a single mother, and how she believes that affects my ability to be an effective parent.\n\nIt all came to a head yesterday when we both were visiting our parents. My sister & I also hung out last weekend and through Wednesday, so I'd been dealing with her undermining me/scoffing/making slick comments all week. Thoughout the evening, she continued to make several comments of disapproval about my parenting, in front of my son. She randomly turned off a movie my son and I were watching to put something on for my niece (who wasnt paying attention), and then stormed out of the room saying \"you're just teaching him that he gets what he wants if he cries\" upon me telling her to turn it back on??\n\nAs we were leaving, she again inappropriately disciplined my overtired, and cranky 3 year old (it was well past his bedtime & he was actually asking to leave lol); I told her to stop, and she said something to the effect of \"if you're not gonna discipline him I will\". \n\nAt that point, I'd had enough. I went ballistic on her, in front of everyone. I pretty much said every cuss word in the book, told her I can't wait til my niece is a toddler so I can laugh right in her face when she learns that toddlers are not rational, emotionally/mentally developed tiny humans. I told her I'm done with her demonizing my son, and I'm done with her turning her entitled ass nose up at me when she won't even take my niece to the store b/c it's \"too much\". I scooped up my son and basically ran out of the house. \n\nOnce I calmed down a bit on the way home, I felt absolutely horrible that I exploded like that in front of my son & parents. I explained to my son that \"mommy was feeling angry, but it was not okay for mommy to yell.\" I'm still super pissed at my sister though, and I'm not responding to her texts/calls. She says I'm overreacting.\n\nMom said I need to just \"let it go\". My dad is siding with me.

Your sister shouldn't be disciplining your kid at all.", "NTA - limit the exposure to her and block her for a bit.", "NTA. Unfortunately, your mom is going to side with the \"baby\" and the daughter who married money. Tbh, take the summer off from hanging out with sister. Arrange seperate visits with your parents so your son can get bonding time without overbearing auntie.

In late September or early October ptesent your (have to be reasonable) conditions. If no one wants to abide, you keep to seperate visits.", "I see who spoiled ur sister. It's ur mother!
