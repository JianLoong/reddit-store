I have no one to talk to about this in real life. Ive been with my boyfriend for 2 years, we met at school. Since our school is in my state he\u2019s met my family multiple times and comes home with me a lot but since he's from out of state I haven't have the chance to meet his parents until recently. He invited me to go back with him for Spring Break to his families summer home where they\u2019d be and I said yes. He\u2019s an only child so it was just going to be me, him and his parents so I was kinda nervous to meet them.\n\nThe trip was great, his parents were really nice. On one of the last nights my boyfriend went out with his dad for the night so it was just me and his mom in the house. She invited me to share a bottle of wine with her and Im not much of a drinker but I didn't want to make things awkward. She drank most of the bottle and got very drunk and we were actually having an interesting conversation. She was telling me about her early life modeling and being a news broadcaster and as the conversation flowed she kept drinking more and more.\n\nIt hit midnight and she was holding her phone screen and all of a sudden started crying. I asked her whats wrong and she said that today is the anniversary for a huge moment in her life and she always gets emotional on this date. She kept crying and then she told me why. She said that shes never told anyone this before and then went on to say that today is the 25th anniversary of her becoming a mom. I was super confused since it wasn't my boyfriends birthday and he's her only child but she kept going and said that it was the day she had \u201chim implanted inside her\u201d and that my boyfriend was an egg donors baby.\n\nShe had no viable eggs so her and her husband used his sperm and someone elses egg to have my boyfriend and no one knew since it was a different time back in the 90s and in her circle she\u2019d be shamed. She was pregnant and gave birth to him, breastfed him and did everything a mother did and that she was never planning to tell him until he was in middle school and they felt guilty so they talked to a child psychologist who told them that they should have told him when he was younger and that they should wait until hes in early twenties to tell him since thats when his empathy will be strong and if they tell him at this age he will never forgive them. My boyfriends 24 and she said she still hasn't told him and at this point never will.\n\n\nI was so shocked I didnt say anything and almost cried myself. She kept talking about her other failed IVFs after him and ended up falling asleep so I left to go to my boyfriends room. When he came back I faked like I was asleep but was up all night sick. Its been two weeks and I still havent told him and Im too scared to. I dont want to be the messenger for such traumatic personal news. His parents should tell him not me.

Your BF is still that woman's son. He is still his dad's son. He is still your BF. I know a lot is made about bloodlines but many families are made from much more than blood and to be honest I think you are taking this information too hard. You probably should talk to his mom about it, and try to rationalize what it all means with her while she is sober. Drunk ramblings can leave people extremely emotional and having a conversation with the mom might be a healthy way to tackle this to try to sort out how you feel about it. It was probably more traumatizing for you having to see this woman you barely know behave this way so maybe things feel more exasperated than they need to.

I've seen videos about people conceived from sperm donations, and the industry is poorly regulated. God help his parents if he decides to do 23 and me and finds his biological mother.", "what a shitty position to have been put in. if it was me i would call the parents and tell them they have put you in an impossible situation and they now need to tell him as youre not willing to keep a secret from him. hes not adopted its an egg donor, she gave birth and all that, the keeping it secret makes it seem a bigger deal than it is.", "YWNBTA if you don't tell him.

Again, not your story to tell.\n\nThis woman gave birth to your boyfriend and has been his mother his entire life.

You do her an incredible disservice for even considering to say anything.", "YWNBTA if you don't tell him.  \n\nLook for an opportunity to talk to his mother when you are both sober, though.  Tell her that it wasn't appropriate for her to tell you, that it put you in an awkward situation until he knows.  Encourage her to tell him.  Point out that if he finds out after her death, he will never be able to tell her that it doesn't matter, or hear the true story of how much he was wanted.  Suggest that a counsellor could help her tell.    \n\n\nAlso - this is going to sound a bit creepy - but if you haven't met these people before, and the only other person you know who knows them is your boyfriend, you might also keep in the back of your mind some questions like, how would you know if she made up the whole story she told you when she was drunk.

Ask them to perhaps expedite the process of telling him so that you don\u2019t have to keep it secret for too long.

But consult someone like an ethicist or counsellor to work through how tk tell him and deal with the fallout. Because there will be fallout.", "Ooof okay I have to say NTA. The mom definitely is for putting you in this position. As to them not having told your BF sooner, I think it was definitely a bad decision, but I can't bring myself to say they're an AH for doing it.\n\nHere's the real issue. If you don't tell him, and you keep this from him, you will be forfeiting any right to be able to ever expect him to trust you, and if he ever finds out you knew, and you kept this from him, he will never trust you again. \n\nHonestly any time I've ever been put in a situation like this(believe it or not it's actually happened more than once), I have responded by telling the person who told me the secret in confidence, that they have a deadline to tell the person themselves, before I tell them. I will not, and do not lie to, or hide things from people who trust me. \n\nSo honestly I would sit down, and tell his mom that you can understand that she told you this information in confidence, and that it must have been an impossible decision to make, but that it was extremely unfair, and inappropriate for her to put the weight of that secret on you, and to expect you to be dishonest with your partner in order to protect it. Then I'd very calmly, and kindly tell her that it's time for her to speak to her son herself, because you refuse to participate in deceiving someone you love, who trusts you.

Not your story to tell but I would encourage your bf's Mom to come clean.", "YWNBTA but it's not really your place to tell him, and not your story to tell. The mom should never have told you that, drunk or not. It was highly inappropriate of her. I would tell her that it makes you uncomfortable to hold this secret from him. If she says she really will never tell him, I don't think you'd be in the wrong to share it with your boyfriend, but this is messy. There is no version of this story that ends without fallout and you should prepare yourself for that. \n\nEthically, I get the perspective that you should keep it to yourself, but I also think if you don't tell him and he finds out years down the line that you knew and kept it from him, he may not forgive you.", "You will be the asshole if you tell him it\u2019s not your place.", "NTA.  \n\nBUT\u2026\n\nWhat happens if he finds out?  Worse, what happens if he found out that you knew?\n\nI think he deserves to know, especially if you guys decide to have children. It\u2019s important to understand any possible genetic conditions. And what happens if he does a DNA test, which is super popular these days.  \n\nI think you should give his mom an opportunity to tell him.  Give her, say, a month.  If she doesn\u2019t tell him, then you will. Make sure you tell her that. \n\nShe is the one who chose to share this incredible burden with you; you didn\u2019t ask for it.", "NTA- you would be the messenger and most definitely shot. \nIt\u2019s Mom and Dad\u2019s story to tell.", "There are no circumstances under which you should say a word about this to him.

You certainly didn't ask for this information, but it's also not yours to share. I'm so sorry you had this confidence forced upon you, but I also wonder if knowing about this would do anything positive for your boyfriend's relationship with his parents. Maybe talk with a counselor or a trusted advisor if this is troubling you.

It is not healthy for you or your relationship for you to be burdened with this information. Whether or not they should have told him from the start and whether he needs to know this information at all are debates that are now moot because his mom put this burden on you without your consent and it is not fair for her to make you carry it. The impact on you from not telling him is just as relevant as the impact of him being told.\n\nI think you need to reach out to his parents and tell them that you are not comfortable keeping this secret from him and that if they don't tell him that you will.  \n\nIf they refuse to tell him, then I think you have to. Find a time when your BF will have some time to process the information (e.g. not right before a big test) and just lay out everything that happened like you did here. Explain that while you know this was not your secret to share, you also did not feel that it was your secret to keep. \n\nRegardless of who is going to tell him, reach out to your schools counseling center ASAP and see what resources they have available for students (don't give them any of his personal information, just the broad strokes) in terms of counseling, therapy, etc. so that if your BF is distressed by the news you can help him access those services.", "You should tell him asap. I know you may think it's none of your business, but his mom made it your business. Frankly at this point you would be betraying him as well if you didn't tell him. He is going to find out one day and also find out that you along with his parents kept it a secret from him. If you want to be his partner for life you need to be able to trust each other. He needs to be able to trust you, but he might not be able to after he finds out about your betrayal.", "NTA, she is his mother, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to tell your boyfriend anything.

I would confront the mom like why did you drag me into this. What if the mom is tactical and did this on purpose to use you as a scapegoat to break the news to him so she won't have to do it. \n\nIm a cynic but this is very strange. I hope you marry him and get to keep the summer house in the divorce bc seriously f*ck this family", "YWNBTA for NOT telling him...\n\nSounds like that was a secret that they were suppose to take to the grave. I would not tell him and just talk to the mom about how you feel but also do not put her in the position where she has to tell him or otherwise.....", "NTA. His mother should not have told you. Yes she was drunk but still. There is a good chance this will destroy your relationship if he finds out you knew. You need to get in contact with his parents and tell them how this makes you feel. It is not your place to tell him. DNA does not make a family. She is his mother in every way that matters.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust TELL him, or end the relationship right now if you can not have his back.

I understand that this is a heavy weight to bear, but truly, it is between your boyfriend and his parents. I think it would be perfectly okay for you to stay out of it, but if you think action is necessary to do something, I would suggest going to your boyfriend\u2019s mother (when sober) and encouraging her to be honest with her son\n\nAfter all, for all these years she\u2019s been his mother, his non-biological parents raised him and cared for him. That\u2019s what being a parent is about, it\u2019s more than just biology.

I understand this is a massive burden and huge secret to keep, which shouldn\u2019t have been placed on you to begin with however, if or when your boyfriend learns the truth, this could be a life altering experience for him which isn\u2019t your place to deliver.", "Yikes. If you intend on staying with him forever, you need to get his mom to tell him. This is beyond unfair to you and I\u2019m so sorry, but you\u2019re being put in an impossible situation here. YWNBTA assuming you can\u2019t convince her its the right thing to do. Since she can\u2019t keep her own f\u2019ing secrets (holy moly) he\u2019ll probably find out someday and if he finds out you knew and didn\u2019t tell him, it\u2019ll blow up in your face. You are his partner not his mother\u2019s. (Maybe talk to the dad, instead?)", "I'm a little surprised by the volume of 'none of your business' type messages here.  The problem here is that this is a HUGE secret, fundamental to her boyfriend's life.  If she thinks this is a lasting relationship, imagine trying to hold this in for years.\n\nAnd make no mistake, he WILL find out.  Are you also going to police him ever getting a 23 or me or anything like that?  Or that some relative who knows lets it slip?  Or that MOM lets it slip?  Are you also going to pretend like it's a big surprise to you when he comes to you with this potentially devastating info?  You knowing but not telling when he discovers the truth will feel like a colossal betrayal.\n\nAll that said, I don't blame you at all (i.e. NTA) for not wanting to tell him.  I suggest you have a very serious conversation with his mom and dad, and let them know that this is not a secret that you're comfortable keeping for years with your significant other.  The mom may not even realize she drunkenly spilled the beans.  Suggest they talk to a counselor about it and then tell him themselves.", "Don't share this! At least, not now....probably not ever.

She gets wine drunk in the hours before implantation anniversary hits when its just you two aka hubs was gone and thus couldn't drag her to bed before she started talking is mighty fucking convenient.\n\nI mean maybe it was just happenstance but his dad knows how she gets during that time.

Bc you prob would be the asshole if you told him depending on how he takes the news. BUT if you keep this secret and he ends up finding out later that you\u2019ve known for x amount of years and never told him, it will most likely end or damage your relationship - he won\u2019t be able to trust you. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be a big deal now, but say you are married and you\u2019re the mother of his kids (since you guys are talking about marriage), then it most def would be a big deal. There is no win-win here, either you hurt him now or you hurt him in the future. It just depends on which one you\u2019re willing to risk. Would you rather him be traumatized by the fact that his mom is not his biological mom or be traumatized by feeling betrayed by his life partner?", "Soooo I don\u2019t think you are the first person this woman told.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s OP story to tell but his parents have not told him in 24 years does anyone think they will now?? If the sperm doner is being told they should meet the child why is this 24 year old any different???? Because she birthed him??  \nThe boyfriend deserves to know.", "YWBTA. He must be told. His parents should have done it but they didn't and now that you know, you must! Can you imagine staying in a relationship with him and YOU knowing and him not?
