I don't know the situation but from what you wrote it doesn't seem like you asked her because you were genuienly concerned for her but more like you were questioning her moral judgement, ability to make good decisions and knowledge about her religion. Everyone practices their religion differently. Just like all christians are different all muslims are also different. So it is in her judgement to decide what she deems okay to do as a practicing muslim. \n\nYou definitely don't need to apologize for rejecting the kiss but if you really meant no harm and were just confused and concerned I don't see why apologizing for the comment you made would be a problem.

People don\u2019t have identical beliefs and their beliefs can also change over time. It is rude to question or judge people\u2019s religious practices or lack there of as long as they are not impacting you. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to kiss the lady? Then don\u2019t that\u2019s it.

I don't feel shame is the right word though, he didn't yell at her or point and laugh or mock her. He asked her a question and I think it was out of surprise.

If two contradictory things are about to occur, I want to know what exactly I'm misunderstanding. \n\nHere's a better comparison: If a married woman was about to kiss me (regardless of my interest in her), I would say, \"Wait, aren't you married?\" She can do whatever she wants, but I'm not going to participate in something that I don't understand the implications of.\n\nHer marriage is the same as her religion.

And any theologist worth their salt would tell you it's a right and a duty to question one's relgion. Maybe she comes out the other side a changed person, maybe it reinforces her faith. Either way that's her decision and her journey. \n\nIf you don't want to kiss then don't kiss her, but next time set your moral gymnastics aside.

I don't see any mention of a second attempt.  She felt humiliated for being shot down.  Perhaps the religion mention caused other reactions at the party.  We don't know the context, and what, 90% of communication is non-verbal?  We weren't there to experience this interaction.  I have no idea how you're jumping to PREDATOR!!!!\n\nI'd be perfectly fine telling a man that hit on me I'm flattered but not interested (since I'm not gay).  My uncle who is gay has said that to women in the past.", "We weren't there, we have no idea what context there was.  OP doesn't even give context for the action outside of \"at some point she leaned for a kiss\".\n\nIt's probable she read the situation wrong, and thought OP was interested.  Why everyone seems to think she's some sort of serial smoocher is beyond me.\n\nAnd also facts is that, unfortunately, societal norms and expectations are different for men and women.  Men, generally, don't have to worry about being victims in these situations.  It's generally frowned upon for women to even be forward like this girl was.  \n\nSo you not telling a man you're flattered is not at all the same, and honestly that sucks.  I'd love it if we had a society where you COULD say that without fear of it being interpreted as a take back of the denial, or an invitation for more.

Leaning away and rejecting the kiss, though, is essentially asking about and trying to enforce it. Best bet in my mind would've been to ask about it after out of curiosity and/or intrigue. \n\nPOV: maybe she's questioning her religion and wanted to try something new. Being rejected from a kiss sucks, but being rejected from a kiss AND having someone call you out on something you're already unsure of/questioning can feel worse. So she might not be \"humiliated\" in the sense that she was embarrassed in front of a crowd, but she took a doubld-risk and you called her out on them. I'd feel humiliated if I were her. \n\nAlso, side note, saying sorry \"if you feel this way\" or \"sorry you're upset\" is a total non-apology. An apology takes responsibility and shows remorse for your own actions and those phrases kind of just show some vague empathy for the person's feelings. In my experience, \"sorry you feel that way\" isn't even a half-apology and ends up making the person feel more annoyed.", "Again, surprise is less of the issue than your response and non-apology.", "Then the answer should have been sorry, not interested.
