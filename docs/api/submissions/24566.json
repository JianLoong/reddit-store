She spent the majority of her middle and high school years at her moms due to divorce custody arrangements.\n\nMy daughter had knee surgery at the end of July to fix a torn ACL. As a result, I\u2019ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc). \n\nLast week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon \u201ccovers/wraps \u201d (I don\u2019t know the official name).\n\nThe next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them.\nShe said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don\u2019t even realize that.\nI told her No they don\u2019t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. \nAt the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. \nI asked her to please use the garbage from now on.\n\nLater that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage. \n\nSeveral days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. \nShe said No. \nI reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. \nShe said I didn\u2019t understand, since I was a man.\nI told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don\u2019t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons?\nShe said I\u2019m not going to Google that.\nI asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that.\nShe said again that I wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. \nI agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. \nI told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. \nShe basically gave up and said Fine.\nAs I was leaving she said that I was being \u201cjust like mom\u201d. \n\nAITA?\n\nPS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions. I\u2019m driving for the next four hours and won\u2019t be able to reply until much later. Judge away!\n\n\nEdit 1 - stopped at Pilot rest stop. Going to respond to just a few questions \nIn the USA \nThere is a garbage can in bathroom. Directly underneath the toilet paper (both in arms reach of the toilet)\nNo lid on trash can.

If not, where did you think she was going to get them?\n\nI realize that isn't the central problem, because she's balking at using plastic bags at all.  But still -- it doesn't sound like she's mobile enough to run out to the store and get something she can use.

I'd want to find some biodegradable bags or something.\n\n(Granted... I never used tampons.  Just didn't.  And when I was young, in the 70s and 80s, the impression at least was that tampons were great because you COULD just flush them, unlike pads.  YES, there are women who try to flush pads. IMAGINE.  Anyway, the fact that some tampon boxes even today claim that they're flushable doesn't help.  Still, I can see why she isn't maybe thrilled at the idea of disposing of them in the trash, but there's got to be ways to do it that cut down on the mess.)", "NTA.

Same with pads and definitely diapers. You never ever flush those things.  Only TP, and even that can be thrown in the trash.

I\u2019d admit that we\u2019ve all done it a couple of times in our lives, but we know we\u2019re not supposed to do it.  Tampons are less likely to damage pipes than a napkin but there is that risk.  They wreck hell on septic tanks and are not good at all for sewage treatment facilities.  \n\nFlushing is easier that wrapping it up in paper and placing it in a waste receptacle, and yes it\u2019s so much neater not to have to dangle the thing while wrapping.

The waste pipe was near vertical down from the first floor flat to the bottom where it went at right angles to the main sewer and the products had just sat at the bottom blocking the whole pipe up.\n\nMy wife puts her products in the bin for me to empty.

Its common sense & just as easy to wrap in tissue & put in trash. Shes just being lazy & doesn't want to change her habit. She admits her mom had an issue w it too. But saying you have to pay the bill if it breaks is also lazy & stupid. Does she even have that much $ to spare on a moments notice? Do you realize it can start a clog or issue in the tank that doesn't need repaired for a long time so it could be months after she moves out (maybe longer) before you even know theres a problem. That happened to us a few yrs ago over paper towels from previous house owner. Your daughter has no intention of stopping unless you put your foot down & demand it. Tell her to switch to pads if she wont stop. The disrespect is crazy & you don't even seem to mind. \n I had a friend who went to dinner at her new bfs house (turns out that his dad was her gynecologist, she broke up w him that night) & she flushed her tampon. The next day she got a plumbers bill, carpet cleaners bill & some other bill. I guess it had clogged & caused it to overflow. He was a dr. She was a college student.

As a result, I\u2019ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc). \n\nLast week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon \u201ccovers/wraps \u201d (I don\u2019t know the official name).\n\nThe next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them.\nShe said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don\u2019t even realize that.\nI told her No they don\u2019t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. \nAt the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. \nI asked her to please use the garbage from now on.\n\nLater that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage. \n\nSeveral days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. \nShe said No. \nI reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. \nShe said I didn\u2019t understand, since I was a man.\nI told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don\u2019t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons?\nShe said I\u2019m not going to Google that.\nI asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that.\nShe said again that I wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. \nI agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. \nI told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. \nShe basically gave up and said Fine.\nAs I was leaving she said that I was being \u201cjust like mom\u201d. \n\nAITA?\n\nPS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions.

If your sewer lateral is newer and doesn't have any cracks or trees roots growing into it, it can probably handle a few tampons every month without getting blocked.\n\nHowever, in recent years many sewer agencies now ask people not to put anything but TP in the toilet because things like tampons, wipes, condoms, etc. along with grease and fat can create giant balls that block the sewer main and cause a very expensive and disgusting problem to fix.", "I am ashamed to admit that I only learned this in my 30's (in the last decade) but have changed my ways now.", "I started using and flushing in late 1980s.
