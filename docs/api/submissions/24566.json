She spent the majority of her middle and high school years at her moms due to divorce custody arrangements.\n\nMy daughter had knee surgery at the end of July to fix a torn ACL. As a result, I\u2019ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc). \n\nLast week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon \u201ccovers/wraps \u201d (I don\u2019t know the official name).\n\nThe next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them.\nShe said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don\u2019t even realize that.\nI told her No they don\u2019t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. \nAt the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. \nI asked her to please use the garbage from now on.\n\nLater that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage. \n\nSeveral days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. \nShe said No. \nI reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. \nShe said I didn\u2019t understand, since I was a man.\nI told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don\u2019t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons?\nShe said I\u2019m not going to Google that.\nI asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that.\nShe said again that I wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. \nI agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. \nI told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. \nShe basically gave up and said Fine.\nAs I was leaving she said that I was being \u201cjust like mom\u201d. \n\nAITA?\n\nPS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions. I\u2019m driving for the next four hours and won\u2019t be able to reply until much later. Judge away!\n\n\nEdit 1 - stopped at Pilot rest stop. Going to respond to just a few questions\n\nIn the USA\n\nThere is a garbage can in bathroom. Directly underneath the toilet paper (both in arms reach of the toilet)\n\nNo lid on trash can. Thanks for suggesting.\n\nEdit 2 - when my daughter says I\u2019m just like her mother, I think that is meant to be a \u201cyou\u2019ve said the rule and regardless of what I say you aren\u2019t going to change your mind.  You won\u2019t listen to me and change your view\u201d\n\nAlso, I think her issue with me is that I couldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to deal with the bloody tampon since I\u2019m a man.", "created_utc": 1691955592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15q83d4/aita_for_telling_my_19yo_daughter_that_shell_pay/", "score": 8008, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lidded trash can might help, and if you want her to use plastic bags -- well, ARE there plastic bags in that bathroom for her to use?  If not, where did you think she was going to get them?\n\nI realize that isn't the central problem, because she's balking at using plastic bags at all.  But still -- it doesn't sound like she's mobile enough to run out to the store and get something she can use.

I'd want to find some biodegradable bags or something.\n\n(Granted... I never used tampons.  Just didn't.  And when I was young, in the 70s and 80s, the impression at least was that tampons were great because you COULD just flush them, unlike pads.  YES, there are women who try to flush pads. IMAGINE.  Anyway, the fact that some tampon boxes even today claim that they're flushable doesn't help.  Still, I can see why she isn't maybe thrilled at the idea of disposing of them in the trash, but there's got to be ways to do it that cut down on the mess.)", "NTA.

Same with pads and definitely diapers. You never ever flush those things.  Only TP, and even that can be thrown in the trash.  Maybe just the #2 TP gets flushed.\n\nAlso it sounds like she might need *this* lecture.  Despite claims by companies selling them, there is no such thing as a truly flushable wipe.  They might say they are on the box, but they do not disintegrate and they plug up plumbing pipes.

As a result, I\u2019ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc). \n\nLast week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon \u201ccovers/wraps \u201d (I don\u2019t know the official name).\n\nThe next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them.\nShe said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don\u2019t even realize that.\nI told her No they don\u2019t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. \nAt the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. \nI asked her to please use the garbage from now on.\n\nLater that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage. \n\nSeveral days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. \nShe said No. \nI reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. \nShe said I didn\u2019t understand, since I was a man.\nI told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don\u2019t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons?\nShe said I\u2019m not going to Google that.\nI asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that.\nShe said again that I wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. \nI agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. \nI told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. \nShe basically gave up and said Fine.\nAs I was leaving she said that I was being \u201cjust like mom\u201d. \n\nAITA?\n\nPS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions.

I moved out for college before the youngest two were an age where you learn about that stuff. \n\nWell, as we all know, when you wrap a tampon in toilet paper, it often soaks right through the toilet paper so you end up still being able to see lots of blood because it just transfers to the toilet paper if its heavy enough, I'm a very heavy bleeder. \n\nAnd as we all know, sometimes pads come unwrapped because the sticky is worn out from being used on your underwear already and since the otherside is wet, sometimes it doesnt matter how tight you roll it up, it'll come undone once in a while.\n\nOkay so one morning before school (7th grade) my mother yanks me from my breakfast to yell at me for \"not\" properly rolling everything in toilet paper. Of course I had, but one of the pads unrolled and she thought i just left it like that on purpose and was chewing me out for leaving it out. She was really hung up on grossing out my brothers and how awful I was for \"letting\" them see it. She even said that the wrappers were too much and i needed to do a better job hiding those, and, of course, my tampons had soaked through the toilet paper and somehow that was my fault. \n\nI was 45 minutes late for school because of this lecture and showed up to gym class late and clearly having been crying. \n\nSo  I did what any 12 year old trying to avoid getting yelled at for an hour again does and completely eliminated any chance of that happening again, and since theres never a 0% chance that it'll happen again, I flushed everything. I mean EVERYTHING. Pads, tampons, pad wrappers.
