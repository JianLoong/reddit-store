April needs to get over herself. 5 years later, Megan asked her for permission, April was engaged for someone else. Now suddenly she is trying to ruin Megan's relationship because \"it's her ex\" ? \n\nWhy is nobody in your family supporting Megan if you guys saw Jack only twice and forgot about him?", "NTA - April has some serious entitlement to think she gets to give her blessing, as well as dictate anything having to do with the wedding, including getting the family to boycott it. And how terrible for Megan that she tried to do the right thing by making sure her sister was okay with the relationship, especially as she was serious in her new one, but now her family is abandoning her.\n\nI get that there\u2019s this thing about former flames being off limits, but I also think that can be a superfluous rule based on the situation.

It seems like this is less about her sister marrying her ex and more about not getting her way with her demands", "NTA- Please ask her to explain the logic of demanding to be MOH if the entire relationship 'shouldn't be', let alone the wedding? My next question would be for the parents: is one sister's ego being unwarrantedly bruised worth more than the happiness of the other sister to the extent that she should give up a good relationship with someone she loves over it?

Our oldest sister (April) was dating Jack for 2 years while they were in college. She was a year ahead of him and when she graduate, she got a job offer in another state. She didn\u2019t want a long distance relationship so she broke up with him before moving. The entire time they dated, we only met him twice so when they broke up, our family completely forgot about him.\n\n5 years later, our youngest sister (Megan) was at an industry convention for her job and ran into Jack as he was one of the speakers. One thing led to another and they started long distance dating. Before it got serious, Megan asked April if she cared and was given \u201cpermission\u201d to continue. April was engaged at the time and didn\u2019t seem to care about their relationship. This year Jack moved back to our state to be closer to Megan and they eventually got engaged.\n\nApril started to make demands like being the maid of honor, vetoing the venue they picked, and not wanting to invite some mutual friends. I\u2019m a dude and Megan\u2019s wedding will be the first one I\u2019ll be going to so I\u2019m not sure April\u2019s demands are out of line but both sisters ended up in a screaming match. I wasn\u2019t there but I heard it got vicious.\n\nTo make a long story short, our family decided to boycott Megan\u2019s wedding next year. Her reasoning is that Megan is breaking some rule by marrying her ex. Of course I think that\u2019s a stupid reason.

Like you said, obviously there will be problems. Any reasonable person would know that. Also, it was a long distance relationship that she started with her sister's ex. That just makes it so much worse in my opinion. It's not like they saw each other often and couldn't fight the chemistry (still not acceptable in my opinion but... less bad). They went out of their way to force this relationship.", "My bet Megan would be also blamed for the fiance leaving her ...", "Not really. \n\nLetting her know may be polite, but they never needed to ask her permission, rather they were being polite or not.", "And look how that turned out!", "The sister dated him for TWO YEARS! And he met the family! There is NO SUGGESTION that Megan and Jack didn't recognise each other when they met - I'd have more sympathy if they hadn't! But just yuck.

April had ZERO claim on a guy that she decided to break up with 5 years earlier (with no animosity, abuse, etc.)\n2. Megan still asked April if it would be an issue and got the green light. At that point, April REALLY had no standing to have an issue - dried-in-cement-no-standing.\n3. April's first reaction was NOT that Megan marrying Jack was an issue. Her initial focus was to want to be the prima donna of the wedding and control it. Mind you, April already had the wedding she got to control. Maybe she wanted to make this wedding her fantasy if she HAD stayed with Jack. Who knows. NONE of it was reasonable.\n4. After Megan (rightly) shut that down, NOW suddenly April is upset that Megan and Jack are marrying. And she gets backed up by mom. I'll bet there's a reason you are closer to Megan than the others, and I'll be it has something to do with how mom favors certain kids or how certain kids get away with entitled/obnoxious demands. In any case, it's probably great for Megan if April doesn't attend. But April and mom's behavior is atrocious. Their harassment of you is atrocious.\n\nEnjoy the wedding.

Creepy.\nSadly, you can tell who the Golden Child is if your family is boycotting your sisters wedding. April dated the guy and initiated the breakup half a decade ago....she doesn't get to act butt hurt now when she was ok with it before. She probably still has feelings for the guy and your family taking her side is pretty shitty. Go and support your sister at her wedding. I would also be exceptionally petty by taking pictures and publicly posting them for all to see...also making sure to tag each and every family member that decided to be a bag of Richards. Include lovely captions such as \"such a pity no one would be here. They instead would rather give in to the delusional tantrums of an insane adult. He looks better with Megan anyway. Hope April's boyfriend never realizes he's just a stand-in as she's still after Jack.\". \nNot my best work but I'm sleep deprived. You can make something much better I'm sure.

Now, 2 years of dating is VERY different than 1 make-out session (which we all hate being reminded of, because it\u2019s just WEIRD), but she broke up with him, seemingly years ago.
