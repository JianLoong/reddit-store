Just because that group is OK with their friend's behavior doesn't mean you have to be.", "Info: Had you already paid/made arrangements to pay for your portion of the food/drinks? Or did you up and leave someone else with a surprise bill?", "Not the asshole, if you feel unsafe, you leave.", "nta. it's completely understandable that you left the restaurant given the circumstances. the two guys were being disruptive and disrespectful making it difficult for everyone to enjoy the evening. you tried to address the issue politely but they reacted poorly. your decision to leave was reasonable and considerate especially after apologizing to the birthday friend. the people who called you rude for leaving are disregarding the negative impact those guys had on the overall experience. you did the right thing by prioritizing your own comfort and well-being.", "NTA. You attended, seemingly tried tonsort a situation that was bothering multiple people and got shouted at for your trouble.\n\nIf you just politely announced you were heading off, NTA, you aren't obligated to stay anywhere that you're not having fun \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA, why should you stay somewhere that you did not feel comfortable. Were you the only one uncomfortable, you make it sound like most of you should have been due to the interrogation techniques they used.", "nta. leaving the restaurant was the right move. those two guys were being obnoxious and it's understandable that you didn't want to stick around for their nonsense. your friends should have understood and supported your decision to leave. don't let their criticism get to you \u2013 they're the ones who should have spoken up against those disruptive individuals. you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nI have relatives who are likely to behave exactly in the same manner- *without alcohol involved.* \n\n Walking away from that situation was as valid a choice for you as those who chose to remain and continue to be abused by those AHs. To each their own.", "More info needed. Were you their rides?  What's the big deal about leaving otherwise?", "Info - how did you tell them to \u201cgive it up\u201d. \n\nI think we need more info here because this could be a polite reminder that they were being inappropriate or could be a loud drunken confrontation in a public space.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its crazy someone really thought you were in the wrong, when two of them were literally discussing loudly and inappropriately, and even attacked you! \n\nYou tried to calm them. They didnt.

It's too bad you weren't able to celebrate longer with your friend, but if they were being hostile and confronting people, it's your choice to take care of your responsibilities, wish your friend a happy birthday and leave.", ">e\n\nNTA then. Sounds like they started acting like AHs and you noped right outta there, which is your prerogative.", "NTA then but you do seem unsure and you did say the drinks were flowing so mayyyybe you were harsher than you thought"]}
