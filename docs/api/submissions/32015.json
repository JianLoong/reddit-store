For context, I homeschool our 3 kids while taking care of our other 2 that are not in school. Our kids are 9, 8, 6, 4, and 2. I do most of the housework (our oldest son does dishes and our oldest daughter cleans the table after meals.) I also have a work from home job. He is a disabled military vet so he cannot work a normal job. He stays in bed or on the couch all day. He cooks dinner once every week or so, which is immensely appreciated. I feel awful for the pain he goes through on a daily basis and I don't mind picking up the slack most of the time, although some help would be nice. \n\nI was sitting on the couch resting and had been there for maybe 15 minutes. The kids were playing downstairs. I had forgotten to clean upstairs that morning because my youngest son had an accident so I started doing laundry, which reminded me that I needed to fold and put away some clothes that were sitting out. Then I got distracted cleaning the kids' rooms downstairs, then realized I needed to start homeschool, and that took up a few hours. Then I made them lunch and sat down. He walked out and was immediately mad that the upstairs was a mess. The floor needed vacuumed, dishes needed done, there was clutter all over the table, our laundry needed put away, the bathrooms needed cleaned, and the floor needed swept. I told him I was planning to get to it. He then accused me of not participating around the house and not spending time with the kids. I snapped and told him, \"Well that's rich coming from you.\" \n\nI felt bad instantly, but was too mad to apologize. He didn't talk to me the rest of the day, and slept on the couch. As soon as I came out of our room this morning, he went in our room and slammed the door. I tried apologizing and he said he forgives me, but there's still a lot of tension. I feel bad.

Why is he permitted to not contribute to your family at all?", "\" but he can run and things like that.\" (From OP's replies)\n\nIf he can run and things like that, he can do 50% of the household chores.  Also, he can help homeschool.  Or, you can start sending your kids to school and take  some load off.\n\nYou are  doing 100% of the child raising, household chores, and teaching.  Time for him to get off his ass.\n\nOh, and thank your 32M oldest child for his service for me.  NTA and stop apologizing for snapping at him.  He owes you the apology.", "ETA - I say this lightly but he is 100% TAH for his lack of contribution to the basic household chores and childcare, I rad that he just has 30% ankle mobility but that means his hands work fine and his legs generally speaking. He can grab a chair and do dishes, cook meals, sit on bed and fold clothes after brinign them upstairs, putting loads in (takes all of 2 mins), and hte list goes on.\n\nAnd you because you have enabled his behaviour and his laziness. It's time to sit down and tell hi you've had enough of doing EVERYHING in the home while he sits on his ass and how you can be empathetic to his situation but at some point the empathy needs to go.", "NTA. You\u2019re being abused, and your husband has no standing to criticize you. \n\nGiven your circumstances, maybe time to send your older kids to school?", "Put the kids in school and get a full-time job. You are the breadwinner. Your husband is disabled. This is your reality.", "YTA. But not because of what you said, YTA to yourself for letting him sit on his ass and do nothing to help the household. You\u2019re a single married mom.", "Info:  Is he physically able to clean around the home?", "Think of the example you are setting for your kids. That men don\u2019t have to do anything, even work because women will do it all at the expense of their own mental and physical health. That women are second to men. One  poster was totally correct saying what he is doing is abuse.  Being Christian doesn\u2019t mean you have to allow yourself to be treated this way. There is plenty he can do both inside and outside the house. If he doesn\u2019t want to work Turn the homeschooling over to him. Turn laundry over to him and the older kids. If you cook he and the older kids can help you with both prep and cleaning. There are plenty of other chores he and the kids can do to make it more equitable and easy on you.", "NTA. Yes, he is appreciated for being a disabled vet. But the fact that he cannot work does not mean he cannot clean around the house and do other things to help you. You are not his maid.", "Why can\u2019t he contribute to the household? You call him in it so he throws a mantrum?", "NTA for snapping, but yeah YTA for everything else. I grew up in a similar situation and I no longer speak to my parents. Your children are learning this is how a family/marriage should be, are you really ok with that? Your daughters especially are going to have a very hard time if you let this continue.", "So, there are a lot of things going on and I\u2019ve read your comments that you are very religious, dependent on him, etc. \n\nSo, if you aren\u2019t willing to divorce him, I suggest making it unpalatable for him to live this way. Stop homeschooling your three children. Don\u2019t clean like you\u2019re his maid. When he\u2019s sleeping on the couch in the middle of the day, vacuum the room. Make enough food for you and the kids. Don\u2019t cook for him. Don\u2019t do his laundry. Don\u2019t sleep with him and don\u2019t have anymore children with him. \n\nWhen he\u2019s unhappy about this, tell him you\u2019ll change when he does. \n\nUltimatum #1 - your name will be added to the house and the car.\nUltimatum #2 - he\u2019s getting a vasectomy. You\u2019re done being his baby factory. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t get to have relations with you. \nUltimatum #3 - he will have to do chores and parent his children. If he\u2019s in pain, you will take him to doctors to see what can be done. You will help him with physical therapy, but sitting on his butt, not working and not helping you is no longer an option. \n\nYou\u2019re not his mother and you\u2019re not his maid. You are partners who are supposed to want what is best for each other. You have spent considerable time wanting what was best for him, and now he will need to show the same consideration for you.", "NTA. while I can not imagine the pain he could be in, it does not excuse him from life. You are basically running the house as a single parent if he isn\u2019t working and is only cooking 1 meal a week, if that. \n\nYou are entitled to a bad day. You are entitled to taking a break or having the house be messy for a day or two. \n\nBut another thing. At 9,8 and 6. The kids should be helping more. Loading and unloading the dishwasher. Helping change laundry loads and sort washed and fold. The 4 year old could get in on the sorting. \n\nI get not being able to work. But it is physically or mentally?  And there is a huge difference between not being able to work, and not being able to be a father and husband.", "NTA.  I say this as a homeschool mom whose DH deployed right after we decided to start homeschooling.  It's a lot, and you can't do it all.  I had to hire a housekeeper to take care of the floors and bathrooms just so I could juggle it all while he was away.  \n\n\nWhile he's not deployed it sounds like he might as well be with all you have on your plate.  But the fact is, he is home and there is a lot he could do despite the disability/mobility issues he seems to have that would contribute to lessening the household load.  He had no right to be mad at you with all that had to be done and then you needing a 15 minute break.  I have no idea how long you've been dealing with this dynamic, but it's not normal, and it is also not sustainable.  Maybe consider counseling because if it isn't already bad, it is likely to get worse.", "i just wanna ask two things. are you happy? is this the kind of example u wanna set for your daughters?because your husband is being really bad rn. your oldest is 9 and he helps so does your 8 year old. if they can, he can. and if he can\u2019t then he needs to learn how to shut up and appreciate you more because you\u2019re doing everything for him and busting your ass out. i saw in one comment that you said divorce is only allowed if abuse or adultery. is abuse only physical? what about mental and emotional? i\u2019m sorry op but u deserve better. i hope it works out for you<3", "Go get yourself a real man", "Put those kids in public school and stop treating your husband as if he is your oldest child.\n\nI'm a disabled military veteran who works full time, and takes care of my home.", "You're not even 30 and have 5 kids with an unemployed, ungrateful and disrespectful man? Why are you homeschooling the kids? Send them to public school and use the extra time to focus on skills that will help you get a job. Like none of your decisions make sense.

You are not his wife you are his servant. Your choice.", "this is not acceptable behavior from him, and it is also not an acceptable situation. i wonder what he brings to your relationship at all? he clearly does not respect or value you. \n\nyou are NTA. this is abuse. i read your comments. religious abuse is convincing people they cannot get divorced. god does NOT want you AND your kids to suffer, and both you and your CHILDREN are SUFFERING in this situation. do you want to follow a god that WANTS you and your children to suffer? didn\u2019t he send his only son so that you wouldn\u2019t suffer? \n\nall of your comments indicate you are being abused and it is your responsibility to remove both yourself and your children from this situation. i say this as someone who divorced an abuser. i will tell you i am SO MUCH happier now that i left. you and your children deserve that too.", "NTA.

My dad worked 9-to-5 for most of my childhood and he STILL participated in teaching and raising all six of us kids. I also never heard him get upset about messes to my mom, like EVER. I mean, they had their arguments but he understood that my mom had a lot on her plate and they both agreed that education came first so he didn't freak out if a few chores were undone. You don't have to accept his behavior since it's perfectly reasonable to expect him to help out and not accuse you of laziness.", "Ma\u2019am. I have read your replies and I get that you are religious but you must know that plenty of religious people have had divorced, correct? If god loves you, and he does, he would want better for you (and for those kids) than this. He will forgive you. \n\nYou say you are in this position because of your upbringing with a narcissistic mother. By exposing your kids to this type of lifestyle what do you think they are learning? Surely you want a better life for them.", "NTA you are doing your best as a partner and mother, you are basically a single mom at this point. Does he not have family or friends you trust with childcare? Is he disabled? If he knows his own struggles he would find way to alleviate the burden it would be for his partner.  I respect people of service but if you are in the swing of having multiple children under the age of ten, you should understand the efforts it takes to control them.", "NTA but this is an abusive situation.  You are doing ALL the work.  All of it.  For the kids, the house, the income, homeschooling, all of it.  \n\nIf he can cook dinner once a week, he can do more.  If he can run, he can vacuum.  He can probably work too, but has likely convinced you that he can't, because he knows you'll do it all for him.\n\nI realize you have cultural and religious ideas holding you in this relationship, but...are you happy?  Is this the life you want for yourself, and your kids?  Is this the relationship you want to model for your children?  Would you want your children, especially your daughters, to be in a situation like this as adults?", "NTA.  IDK all the specifics of your husband\u2019s medical condition, but you are doing 99% of the family work, especially with so many kids.  I strongly suggest looking for some outside help.

In your case here it is:\n\n> I felt bad instantly\n\nWhy? Why did you feel bad? You weren't rude. You didn't swear. You told the truth. Frankly, given his behaviour and attitude you were very restrained. Why so restrained? You need to think about what it was in your upbringing that has turned you into an enabling doormat. Don't get me wrong here, your husband is at fault, but he ain't gonna fix this on his own volition. Put on your big girl pants and start kicking his ass.

It might help you see a bit more clearly what is going on in your situation, and that it may actually be abusive.  I don't know what your specific Christian denomination's stance in on emotional abuse, but many churches are waking up to the fact it is real, it is wrong, and accepting that it constitutes grounds for separation and maybe divorce.

It doesn't sound like your husband does much of anything.  If you get so overwhelmed that you get sick what is going to happen to your kids?  To their education?  To your finances?  Will he step up?  If so, why can't he step up now?  You can't make him go, but there are things you can do and personal counselling for yourself may help you work that out.  My prayers are with you.", "If the pastor conducted the counseling that is not real counseling. That is pastoral counseling which is, quite frankly, useless. But honestly it\u2019s not super likely couples therapy would be very effective here, you both need individual therapy (with a trained therapist not a pastor whose only goal is to push the church). You need someone to HELP you, not someone to help keep you in line.", "that\u2019s very common for abusers to refuse that", "Look financially, there are ways you can fix that, women\u2019s groups, government assistance, etc. And \u201cBiblically\u201d shouldn\u2019t even be put into the equation because you are putting some sky dudes (really human men)\u2018s controlling rules over the well being of yourself and your children. \n\nWhat\u2019s more important, following some rules written by the patriarchy thousands of years ago or the current wellbeing of your children? Because you said you are trying to teach your daughters to be independent, but how can really learn if you don\u2019t practice what you teach, because no matter what you tell them, they are going to see the opposite.", "You homeschool  and your husband doesn't work. Move close to your family - a sister? A supportive aunt? You need some support. Or just somewhere you can send your kids to public school. \n\nIt's hard to see the abusiveness of a situation when you are in it. That walking on eggshells-we feel that when we are in toxic and emotionally abusive relationships. \n\nYou know there are lots of disabled vets who work. Contribute to their families. He's making choices. \n\nYou've been abused by your upbringing. You've been taught your life has no intrinsic value - just if you follow others' rules and play the good girl. It's not true. You can be free. You and your children can be healthy and happy. It would be hard, but it could be done. \n\nIf you ever feel unsafe, text \"start\" to 88788.", "If this is what your definition of \"works best\" then go ahead. What qualifications do you even have to homeschool? Do you have a teaching degree? Homeschooling is so easy for you because you're barely teaching them anything. They'll always be at a disadvantage because you didn't let them get a proper education. You're raising the kids in a bigoted and unhealthy community and environment. They will have to go through years of therapy if they ever manage to get out. Maybe then they can have normal lives. I feel sorry for your kids. People like you keep popping them out like it's nothing and they're the ones that suffer.", "why did you move from both your families?", "you and your children deserve to be happy", "Let him be mad and pout, then - who cares?!

Especially when I or one of my kids have appointments. But for the most part he leaves it to me, including all the submissions to the program we use", "Totally THIS!", "I'm in counseling once every other week. My counselor has been really helpful in offering suggestions on how to talk to him to actually get through to him so he won't feel attacked. We essentially live off my husband's disability payments so our finances are unaffected if anything happens to me. I'm just supplementing our income. I rarely get sick, but when I do it's pretty bad. He steps up when I get sick, but just barely.  He says he can't step up most of the time because if he does too much he gets sick. He's immunocompromised and exhibits symptoms of a cold most of the time. He'll get sick then have symptoms months after he's no longer sick.", "We moved when he got out of the military because cost of living is so high where we were. My husband's brother also told us he was moving his family so a specific city, so my husband moved us there. They changed their minds after we had already moved and live in a different state 7 hours away. We are essentially stuck away from all family.", "I didn't snap a vacuum lol, I snapped at my husband", "This is abuse.", "I'm a divorced Christian, and last time I checked. God would rather have you worshipping him as a solo parent than as an abused resentful wife. The Bible said that a husband is meant to love his wife the way Christ loves the church. Your husband is not fulfilling the role as a Godly husband", "Let me guess ... he's the headship of the family, and the way you're supposed to change his behavior is pray for him. You need to keep sweet and be a soft space to land and be a Proverbs 31 woman. Meanwhile, he gets to be a lazy asshole.", "You don't have to divorce him. I learned this lesson long ago-- men change through consequences, not conversations. Leave him alone in the house for 3 months. Stay married to him, but move in with your parents or something for 3 solid months. When you get back, he'll be Mr. Nanny.", "You know what is needed in a Christian marriage? A husband who serves his wife and sacrifices himself as Jesus did. A leader. A man who ensures there is spiritual growth and stewardship in his family so that they enter eternity.", "Actually.. After years of study... I've learned that this not true.\nHe can run? Then he can work.\nThink better if yourself please. Think what you are telling your children, especially the girls, what to accept.", "Ok enjoy catering to a useless asshole because your fairytale book says you have to. Guessing thats why the kids are homeschooled.", "then dont post on AITA where most ppl call out bullshit like ur husband\u2019s doing. he\u2019s abusing you emotionally but yeah sure it\u2019s all hunky dory bc well god thinks it\u2019s right", "it's an option if it's legal. bad for your female kids to see this dynamic too", "this is abuse", "It is also in the Bible that a man supports his wife and provides for his kids", "I hear you and you aren\u2019t going to get a lot of support here. I want to reach out and tell you to hang on, you can do this. I understand your frustration and he needs to be kind. If he is in significant pain, I know it comes out on you. I know because I\u2019m a former chronic pain warrior. It\u2019s harder on the individual, it\u2019s even harder on the spouse and children. I don\u2019t have an opinion or a judgment.

I'm completely financially dependent on him and we'd have nowhere else to go as the house is under his name, so Biblical reasons aside, there's not really much we can do in terms of leaving", "...yeah, essentially. :( I feel called out lol. I know God wouldn't have given me this life if He couldn't use me through it. But damn it sucks and I want out.", "You're correct. I've had this talk with him and he promised to change and was better for maybe a week, then back to the same old.", "Thank you so much. I really appreciate you. It's super isolating so just knowing that someone gives a shit makes a difference.", "I didn't ??", "Do you have contacts outside of your church community", "God also gave you and every other human free will. Your husband is using his free will to abuse you and make you his slave. You have the free will to leave.

I highly recommend the documentary \u201cShiny Happy People\u201d on Amazon. \n\nLong story short: You\u2019ve been fed lies created by men to (surprise!) keep women who desperately want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing in invisible chains. Does that sound like something any god worth worshipping would want?", "God also has guidance for men to be strong leaders of their families and serve their wives. How is he serving you and your children by berating you about an unclean house when it's obvious that you are overwhelmed? How is he honoring God in your lives by not being a strong leader.

Your husband does not care about you other than for himself.**\n\nNONE OF IT IS NORMAL. Honestly if this doesn't make you even *question* your faith then this entire thread is pointless. \n\n\"My god put me here to be abused by my husband and be an incubator for his genes and refuses to allow us to separate.

Sad.", "Abusers count on the church to convince their wives that they can\u2019t leave.", "I'm so sorry you're going through this. The God of love and mercy would not want you or your kids to suffer. This isn't a test of your strength. The only one failing here is your husband. He isn't doing his share of the work. If separating from your husband is necessary, God would be at your side. The Bible says that if a husband is an impediment to his wife's faith, she should divorce him. \n\nYour husband is not keeping the vows he made before God on your wedding day. He promised to love and cherish you in sickness and in health.  He doesn't get to check out and require you do everything. I'm disabled and in severe chronic pain. I still take care of my responsibilities as much as possible.

We can't afford to live out there", "I didn't, maybe read the post again", "Try to find a shelter or some kind of assistance to leave. Your children will thank you for it.
