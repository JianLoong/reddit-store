For context, I homeschool our 3 kids while taking care of our other 2 that are not in school. Our kids are 9, 8, 6, 4, and 2. I do most of the housework (our oldest son does dishes and our oldest daughter cleans the table after meals.) I also have a work from home job. He is a disabled military vet so he cannot work a normal job. He stays in bed or on the couch all day. He cooks dinner once every week or so, which is immensely appreciated. I feel awful for the pain he goes through on a daily basis and I don't mind picking up the slack most of the time, although some help would be nice. \n\nI was sitting on the couch resting and had been there for maybe 15 minutes. The kids were playing downstairs. I had forgotten to clean upstairs that morning because my youngest son had an accident so I started doing laundry, which reminded me that I needed to fold and put away some clothes that were sitting out. Then I got distracted cleaning the kids' rooms downstairs, then realized I needed to start homeschool, and that took up a few hours. Then I made them lunch and sat down. He walked out and was immediately mad that the upstairs was a mess. The floor needed vacuumed, dishes needed done, there was clutter all over the table, our laundry needed put away, the bathrooms needed cleaned, and the floor needed swept. I told him I was planning to get to it. He then accused me of not participating around the house and not spending time with the kids. I snapped and told him, \"Well that's rich coming from you.\" \n\nI felt bad instantly, but was too mad to apologize. He didn't talk to me the rest of the day, and slept on the couch. As soon as I came out of our room this morning, he went in our room and slammed the door. I tried apologizing and he said he forgives me, but there's still a lot of tension. I feel bad.

Why is he permitted to not contribute to your family at all?", "\" but he can run and things like that.\" (From OP's replies)\n\nIf he can run and things like that, he can do 50% of the household chores.  Also, he can help homeschool.  Or, you can start sending your kids to school and take  some load off.\n\nYou are  doing 100% of the child raising, household chores, and teaching.  Time for him to get off his ass.\n\nOh, and thank your 32M oldest child for his service for me.  NTA and stop apologizing for snapping at him.  He owes you the apology.", "ETA - I say this lightly but he is 100% TAH for his lack of contribution to the basic household chores and childcare, I rad that he just has 30% ankle mobility but that means his hands work fine and his legs generally speaking. He can grab a chair and do dishes, cook meals, sit on bed and fold clothes after brinign them upstairs, putting loads in (takes all of 2 mins), and hte list goes on.\n\nAnd you because you have enabled his behaviour and his laziness. It's time to sit down and tell hi you've had enough of doing EVERYHING in the home while he sits on his ass and how you can be empathetic to his situation but at some point the empathy needs to go.", "NTA. You\u2019re being abused, and your husband has no standing to criticize you. \n\nGiven your circumstances, maybe time to send your older kids to school?", "Put the kids in school and get a full-time job. You are the breadwinner. Your husband is disabled. This is your reality.", "YTA. But not because of what you said, YTA to yourself for letting him sit on his ass and do nothing to help the household. You\u2019re a single married mom.", "Info:  Is he physically able to clean around the home?", "Think of the example you are setting for your kids. That men don\u2019t have to do anything, even work because women will do it all at the expense of their own mental and physical health. That women are second to men. One  poster was totally correct saying what he is doing is abuse.  Being Christian doesn\u2019t mean you have to allow yourself to be treated this way. There is plenty he can do both inside and outside the house. If he doesn\u2019t want to work Turn the homeschooling over to him. Turn laundry over to him and the older kids. If you cook he and the older kids can help you with both prep and cleaning. There are plenty of other chores he and the kids can do to make it more equitable and easy on you.", "NTA. Yes, he is appreciated for being a disabled vet. But the fact that he cannot work does not mean he cannot clean around the house and do other things to help you. You are not his maid.", "Why can\u2019t he contribute to the household? You call him in it so he throws a mantrum?", "NTA for snapping, but yeah YTA for everything else. I grew up in a similar situation and I no longer speak to my parents. Your children are learning this is how a family/marriage should be, are you really ok with that? Your daughters especially are going to have a very hard time if you let this continue.", "So, there are a lot of things going on and I\u2019ve read your comments that you are very religious, dependent on him, etc. \n\nSo, if you aren\u2019t willing to divorce him, I suggest making it unpalatable for him to live this way. Stop homeschooling your three children. Don\u2019t clean like you\u2019re his maid. When he\u2019s sleeping on the couch in the middle of the day, vacuum the room. Make enough food for you and the kids. Don\u2019t cook for him. Don\u2019t do his laundry. Don\u2019t sleep with him and don\u2019t have anymore children with him. \n\nWhen he\u2019s unhappy about this, tell him you\u2019ll change when he does. \n\nUltimatum #1 - your name will be added to the house and the car.\nUltimatum #2 - he\u2019s getting a vasectomy. You\u2019re done being his baby factory. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t get to have relations with you. \nUltimatum #3 - he will have to do chores and parent his children. If he\u2019s in pain, you will take him to doctors to see what can be done. You will help him with physical therapy, but sitting on his butt, not working and not helping you is no longer an option. \n\nYou\u2019re not his mother and you\u2019re not his maid. You are partners who are supposed to want what is best for each other. You have spent considerable time wanting what was best for him, and now he will need to show the same consideration for you.", "NTA. while I can not imagine the pain he could be in, it does not excuse him from life. You are basically running the house as a single parent if he isn\u2019t working and is only cooking 1 meal a week, if that. \n\nYou are entitled to a bad day. You are entitled to taking a break or having the house be messy for a day or two. \n\nBut another thing. At 9,8 and 6. The kids should be helping more. Loading and unloading the dishwasher. Helping change laundry loads and sort washed and fold. The 4 year old could get in on the sorting. \n\nI get not being able to work. But it is physically or mentally?  And there is a huge difference between not being able to work, and not being able to be a father and husband.", "NTA.  I say this as a homeschool mom whose DH deployed right after we decided to start homeschooling.  It's a lot, and you can't do it all.  I had to hire a housekeeper to take care of the floors and bathrooms just so I could juggle it all while he was away.  \n\n\nWhile he's not deployed it sounds like he might as well be with all you have on your plate.  But the fact is, he is home and there is a lot he could do despite the disability/mobility issues he seems to have that would contribute to lessening the household load.  He had no right to be mad at you with all that had to be done and then you needing a 15 minute break.  I have no idea how long you've been dealing with this dynamic, but it's not normal, and it is also not sustainable.  Maybe consider counseling because if it isn't already bad, it is likely to get worse.", "i just wanna ask two things. are you happy? is this the kind of example u wanna set for your daughters?because your husband is being really bad rn. your oldest is 9 and he helps so does your 8 year old. if they can, he can. and if he can\u2019t then he needs to learn how to shut up and appreciate you more because you\u2019re doing everything for him and busting your ass out. i saw in one comment that you said divorce is only allowed if abuse or adultery. is abuse only physical? what about mental and emotional? i\u2019m sorry op but u deserve better. i hope it works out for you<3", "Go get yourself a real man", "Put those kids in public school and stop treating your husband as if he is your oldest child.\n\nI'm a disabled military veteran who works full time, and takes care of my home.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Your choice.", "this is not acceptable behavior from him, and it is also not an acceptable situation. i wonder what he brings to your relationship at all? he clearly does not respect or value you. \n\nyou are NTA. this is abuse. i read your comments. religious abuse is convincing people they cannot get divorced. god does NOT want you AND your kids to suffer, and both you and your CHILDREN are SUFFERING in this situation. do you want to follow a god that WANTS you and your children to suffer? didn\u2019t he send his only son so that you wouldn\u2019t suffer? \n\nall of your comments indicate you are being abused and it is your responsibility to remove both yourself and your children from this situation. i say this as someone who divorced an abuser. i will tell you i am SO MUCH happier now that i left. you and your children deserve that too.", "NTA.

My dad worked 9-to-5 for most of my childhood and he STILL participated in teaching and raising all six of us kids. I also never heard him get upset about messes to my mom, like EVER. I mean, they had their arguments but he understood that my mom had a lot on her plate and they both agreed that education came first so he didn't freak out if a few chores were undone. You don't have to accept his behavior since it's perfectly reasonable to expect him to help out and not accuse you of laziness.", "Ma\u2019am. I have read your replies and I get that you are religious but you must know that plenty of religious people have had divorced, correct? If god loves you, and he does, he would want better for you (and for those kids) than this. He will forgive you. \n\nYou say you are in this position because of your upbringing with a narcissistic mother. By exposing your kids to this type of lifestyle what do you think they are learning? Surely you want a better life for them.", "NTA you are doing your best as a partner and mother, you are basically a single mom at this point. Does he not have family or friends you trust with childcare? Is he disabled? If he knows his own struggles he would find way to alleviate the burden it would be for his partner.  I respect people of service but if you are in the swing of having multiple children under the age of ten, you should understand the efforts it takes to control them.", "NTA but this is an abusive situation.  You are doing ALL the work.  All of it.  For the kids, the house, the income, homeschooling, all of it.  \n\nIf he can cook dinner once a week, he can do more.  If he can run, he can vacuum.  He can probably work too, but has likely convinced you that he can't, because he knows you'll do it all for him.\n\nI realize you have cultural and religious ideas holding you in this relationship, but...are you happy?  Is this the life you want for yourself, and your kids?  Is this the relationship you want to model for your children?  Would you want your children, especially your daughters, to be in a situation like this as adults?", "NTA.  IDK all the specifics of your husband\u2019s medical condition, but you are doing 99% of the family work, especially with so many kids.  I strongly suggest looking for some outside help.

In your case here it is:\n\n> I felt bad instantly\n\nWhy? Why did you feel bad? You weren't rude. You didn't swear. You told the truth. Frankly, given his behaviour and attitude you were very restrained. Why so restrained? You need to think about what it was in your upbringing that has turned you into an enabling doormat. Don't get me wrong here, your husband is at fault, but he ain't gonna fix this on his own volition. Put on your big girl pants and start kicking his ass. Do it today.\n\nNTA and start acting like the leader you can be, not the timid submissive subordinate that does everything yet gets slated for it.

It might help you see a bit more clearly what is going on in your situation, and that it may actually be abusive.  I don't know what your specific Christian denomination's stance in on emotional abuse, but many churches are waking up to the fact it is real, it is wrong, and accepting that it constitutes grounds for separation and maybe divorce.  Not that I'm suggesting divorce, but I think you may need some help from more than redditors to help you step back and see what is really going on in your household.  \n\n\nYou are the one holding up the sky right now.

I'll definitely sit down and figure out what equitable division looks like.", "He's gotten a bunch of children upon her, and forgotten all the rest of the stuff he should do.", "I\u2019m not laughing, and you shouldn\u2019t be, either.", "So he was married to his first wife for 4 years and she left him and filed for divorce beginning of 2016. She took them for 7 months, then one day called us and said that being a mom was really ruining her newfound freedom and gave them to us. We have primary custody. She hasn't seen them in over 2 years.", "Call this number: 1-800-799-7233.  It\u2019s the National Domestic Violence Hotline.  It doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s no physical abuse.  They won\u2019t judge you.  But they *will* help you create a safety plan to get you out.  If you can\u2019t talk on the phone freely, try thehotline.org.\n\nI know you likely won\u2019t do that today.  But keep that number somewhere handy in case you change your mind.  I grew up fundie.  You *can* get out.", "How on earth are you home schooling 3 kids, taking care of another 2, keeping the entire house together & working from home?? OP, you can\u2019t see it but you\u2019re superwoman and really selling yourself short!! If you can do all that, imagine what you could accomplish if you put your mind to moving out? Did he suggested the homeschooling? I\u2019m going to guess yes. I don\u2019t know a lot about your husband but based on the lil bit of information you gave us, how he is using manipulation & you\u2019re the one apologizing?! That type of man, in my experience, made it so you\u2019d be dependent on him on purpose. Having so many kids back to back, home schooling, having to also run the entire house on your own? All this is so you can\u2019t work more, are dependent on him. Get the school aged kids in school immediately. Work more hours. Don\u2019t feel like you need to keep every inch of the house spotless at all times. I know when people say to pack the kids & just leave it\u2019s not that easy. I\u2019ve been there. But what you can do in the meantime is to start making moves to get yourself in a position to leave. (And absolutely don\u2019t get pregnant again!) You are not a housewife Cinderella OP. You deserve happiness & a partner that wants to help & engage with his children instead of manipulating you. Don\u2019t be held hostage with religion. If you stay in this marriage there\u2019s a high chance your daughters will grow up and get in the same situations & your sons will grow up and act like their father. I know reddit throws around the \u2018leave, divorce\u2019 advise like it\u2019s a frisbee competition but in your case I really think you should make some serious life changes.", "My wife is Autistic and has ADHD. She works a 6 figure salary job that requires zero physical activity, has friends, gets out of the house, pays bills, and does chores. Those diagnoses don\u2019t stop people from being decent humans. Your husband shouldn\u2019t use them as an excuse for his behavior.", "Rooting for you! I\u2019ll pray as well. Feel free to DM any time. I certainly don\u2019t have all the answers, or even maybe any of the answers, but I know the One who does. And I have 20 years of marriage under my belt. \n\nI\u2019ve only recently faced the fact that I may very well be on the spectrum myself. The older (and more stressed?) I get, the harder it is for me to focus. I\u2019m super easily overstimulated. \ud83d\ude2c", "Or your daughter will wind up in the same situation you're in now. Is that the life you want for her?"]}
