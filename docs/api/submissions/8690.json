You are \u201ctoo tired\u201d after work to move some of your stuff so your daughter can actually live in the space as an equal tenant.\n\nWhy are you too tired to move your stuff but not too tired to cash your daughter\u2019s checks?", "I\u2019m going with YTA\u2026you said in the comments she doesn\u2019t even have enough room for HER things in the house. Why should she pay half when the home is filled with all your things? \n\nCharging her rent? Fine, no problem there. But if she doesn\u2019t have full use of half the space in the home yet, then remedy that before you charge her, or adjust the rent % accordingly.", "In case this gets buried in the comments later, here's a [follow-up comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p55w6/comment/j6idaza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from OP:\n\n>I think it is important to mention that she does not bring people over ever as she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d at the state of the house.

She has asked me to get rid of things so she can make space for her items and I have not done so yet, as am I very tired from work and find it hard to clean up when I come home.\n\nBased on this, and OP's additional comment that admits the house is cluttered and messy because of OP's things AND that she doesn't want her daughter to clean it up because her daughter would just throw things out, I'm going with YTA.\n\nSo you want her to be your tenant when it comes to the money and splitting the rent like an unrelated roommate would, but your understanding daughter when it comes to your mess and clutter?\n\nNo, sorry, it doesn't work that way. Either she's an equal tenant with you who pays half the rent and you clean up the common spaces to be respectful of your roommate, or she's your daughter who perhaps has to deal with the mess in exchange for either free or significantly reduced rent.\n\nSo which do you want? You can't have both.", "Edit: Based on OPs other comments, judgment changed to YTA. You do not treat her has an equal so you have no business expecting her to pay equally.\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nIs she an equal tenant? That is, does she have the same private space? Same ability to use the shared spaces (including equal say in decorating, when/how things may be used, etc)? Same ability to come and go as she pleases or to have guests over?  In short, as far as the two of you are concerned, do you act as parent/child or roommate/roommate?\n\nIf everything else is truly equal, than N-T-A, she certainly should be contributing an equal amount. However, it is often the situation that a parent will \"pull rank\" and make the majority of decisions about the space and how the house is run. If that's the case, she should be paying less because she has less.", "Info: does she have as much space as you? Does she have empty rooms for her and her stuff? She definitely needs to pay rent but I\u2019m not sure it should be half", "YTA\n\nI'm changing my judgement upon reading OP's comments elsewhere that the house is very cluttered and messy (giving off Hoarder vibes), and that OP's daughter has asked repeatedly for space to put some of her things but OP refuses to do so, citing being tired after work.\n\nIf you want her to pay rent, she should get a liveable space and it doesn't sound like that's what she's getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of that information was included in the original post, hence the revision.  Old judgement below for posterity\n\n\\--------\n\nNTA\n\nI hate this mentality that some millennials/gen z have of \"You're my parent(s), you have to fund my life forever!\".   Like yeah, the housing market sucks, everything costs a small fortune, student loans suck, and capitalism is hell, so moving back home into young adulthood is no longer rare - but where do y'all get off, thinking that you can not just move home, but do so rent/bill free?", "ESH - because of OPs comment. OP mentioned the house does not have enough space for the daughter to use as OP hasnt made room for the daughter. \n\nIf they both live there they both should be contributing but there needs to be respect and accommodation given.", "So could you pay for it on your own?   If so why don\u2019t you want to set your daughter up to succeed? She doesn\u2019t have any place for her stuff but pays half the bills.  She wants to get her own place but can\u2019t save while paying half.  Asking her to pay some rent is fine but paying she much she can\u2019t ever move - if you can afford the rent yourself- is not being a good mom IMI", "Wow, that edit is crucial info to leave out OP. \n\nSetting aside that as a parent, you should try to do what's best for your child, and allow her to save as much as possible since you don't need the money... If you want to treat her like a roommate instead of your child when it comes to finances, then you have to actually treat her like a roommate when it comes to living arrangements too. That means she needs equal say over the space. If you won't or can't do that, it's wildly unfair to charge her half the rent. So if she doesn't have the same control over the space as you, and you won't even clean some of your mess or give her enough space for her things, then yes absolutely **YTA.**", "INFO:  What percentage of your daughter\u2019s take home pay is half the rent?\n\nIt\u2019s in thing if she\u2019s paying 15% of her take home pay for rent. It is a completely different thing if she is paying 75% of what she makes on rent.", "YTA she has no space why should your daughter pay half when all your 'clutter' (hording) is taking up the entire house", "Well\n\nMy mom charged me for 1/3 of the rent while I was a working student (!) and I had no say in decorations etc apart from my room. This was a total no go tbh as it took a lot of saving opportunities away from me and led to quite a lot of anxiety - in the years before, she barely invested the child support into me -\n\nYour daughter works full time so she will have more money to spend but if you charge her for half, she needs a space she is not embarrassed by (regarding your other comments) and where she can bring people over. So fix the space, then you can charge half of the rent. If you can't fix it, don't charge half. \nSo currently YTA", "N T A\n\nShe's 25.  If she were living on her own she'd be paying the *entire* rent.  This arrangement does potentially allow her to save money.\n\nEdit:  Ohhh, from OP's comments this sounds like a hoarding situation.  She has no room to put any of her belongings because OP won't clean the admitted \"clutter\" and refuses to have anything thrown away, just moved around into different piles.  Daughter offers to clean (which includes removing some of the mess) and is rebuffed.  So the daughter doesn't have anywhere *near* equal access to the living space.\n\nESH she should be paying some amount of rent. But the mess needs to be properly acknowledged and dealt with. I grew up in this kind of situation and I get that it's a difficult thing, but this isn't good for anyone.", "NAH - I think there are two ways of looking at it. Is it equally her place as much as yours? Can she redecorate, have dates stay over, ask you to get your dishes out of the sink? Or is it more your place that you are in charge of and she's staying there? If you're the one more in charge of the place then I don't think it is fair to have her pay a full half.", "NTA. She shares your living space, it's perfectly reasonable for her to pay a fair amount. 50/50 sounds pretty fair, hopefully she helps with chores as well. She is allowed to \"save her money\" but you aren't? Just because you're her mom? Well you're a person, too.\n\nEDIT: I wrote NTA under the assumption OP takes care of her own place. If the place is a mess and the daughter doesn't even have access the some of the space due to junk, then no she definitely shouldn't be paying for half and you should learn to clean up after yourself. Plenty of people are tired from work and find time to clean, you don't need to do everything at once.", "Yta, i am all for kids paying half or part of the bills since usage is a factor but rent is fixed and you didn't move to a bigger place to accommodate both of you, it's the same accommodation. So this rent is something you would have to cover anyway plus it's less than expected so why not help her by not charging her rent? She is not wasting her money but saving it.", "ESH.\n\nShe should not be paying half if she doesn't have equal control over the whole place.\n\nCharge her market rate for renting out one bedroom.", "NTA\n\nShe is an adult. If she wants to live with you, she needs to pay rent. \n\nIt would be different if she had just finished school at 18 and on a low paying job due to no experience, but she is 25 and needs to start acting like it.", "NTA.

Why don\u2019t you take the time to clear out your mess (since this is a repetitive argument) and show her your open to making the home work for the both of you. You can\u2019t not clean up after yourself and not make room for her things and guest to come over bc your to tired from work and still expect her to want to pay half of everything. Is this going to be a parent/child situation or a roommate situation you can\u2019t have it both ways. Someone paying half of everything in the home deserves to be able to enjoy the home. If you really can\u2019t clean up after yourself and she can\u2019t enjoy her home like someone who\u2019s paying half of everything maybe you should try a compromise 60/40 split or she pays all utilities and groceries and you pay rent. I think it\u2019s disgusting your asking someone to pay half of something they can\u2019t use bc you.", "NTA.\n\nI don't know what is fair or not regarding rent with children but having her support you with some money for at least food, water, electricity and stuff is the bare minimum.", "NTA. Sounds reasonable.", "NTA. She\u2019s saving money by living with you, either way, if she can\u2019t afford to live alone. It\u2019s not your job to pay for her housing so she can buy her own place.", "Originally N T A but changed to ESH after the edit. She's an adult with a job, she needs to pay rent. That is most definitely fair. What is unfair is her expecting that you are going to fund the downpayment on her house, or her education. While it would be a very generous thing for you to do that, if you are financially able to, you certainly aren't obligated.\n\nAs to your edit, though, now you absolutely need to take responsibility for that. If there is so much clutter in the house that she can't bring her own things in, and she feels that she can't invite people over, that is a huge problem. If this is a space where she is paying half of the rent and she can't actually comfortably live there due to you being \"very tired\" and unable to clean the space, that is on YOU.", "She's an adult who is living with you.

Given she has less stuff than you, it'll likely still be 90% your house, but you WILL need to compromise on how things are right now. \n* You get the complete control of the house, don't have to change anything to your current habits, don't have to face up to your messiness/potentially bit of a hoarding problem, BUT she pays significantly less than 50% of the rent, and she effectively rents a room from you. \n\nIt is unfair to expect the financial benefits from the first AND the personal benefits from the second. It is not unfair to expect her to pay some rent.", "You are not easy to live with if she can\u2019t use the living space because of your clutter.", "You hate your daughter and you don\u2019t even clean", "That is very true.", "Sure op doesn't even want  to support his roomate in any capacity. He doesn't even clean", "I have asked her to help but she has said that if she helps me clear stuff out she would simply throw everything away. The house is admittedly cluttered and messy.", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean. She is an adult and these are her expenses.", "how is anything in this post point you to the conclusion that she hates her daughter? You think she hates her daughter because she is trying to teach her financial responsibilities? I know so many people who\u2019s parents could give less about them once they turn 18. Her daughter is lucky to have a mom that cares.", "Pump the breaks.  This sounds very hoarder-esque and should have be included in the original post", "Is this a hoarding type of situation?", "Why can't she toss everything away?", "This, in combination with your other comments, demonstrates that you're a hoarder and you have a substantial amount of trash cluttering the house.\n\nYou also have no right to charge her half rent/utilities when she doesn't have use of half the space. In fact, you have no right to charge her any rent if the space isn't something you'd be able to rent to a non family/friend tennant.", "NTA, \nYeah dont let people make you feel bad for having her share in the rent if she was just a renter renting a room then it would be expected the house is furnished to the primary renter or owners liking. Would it be nice for you to include her more in the decor? Yeah sure of course, but its not implied like people are giving you a problem for. You should at minimum keep the area clean of your own messiness and she should be responsible for hers. At the end of the day she is an adult well over the age of 18 and if you are asking her to pay rent as a condition to living there she should pay it or move out its really that simple.", "Read OP\u2019s comments. The daughter is being asked to pay half the cost but not getting 50% of use of the house", "That\u2019s what I think too. I know hoarders. How\u2019s she\u2019s talking about her house it\u2019s at least a 2 on the hoarding scale.  I\u2019m sure the daughter is resentful that her mom wants her to pay to live in a dirty, hoarded house.", "No, it\u2019s not that bad, just papers and misc on surfaces. You can see our floor.", "I just read the update! Definitely voting YTA now", "I mean if your criteria is \u201cyou can see the floor\u201d that doesnt sound that good.", "I know hoarders.  It sounds like you\u2019re at least, at minimum a two on the hoarding scale if your daughter said her helping you clean would be throwing most things out.  I\u2019m a mother and I would be mortified to ask my child for rent for a house that\u2019s so dirty she\u2019s embarrassed by it and so full she doesn\u2019t have room for her own things.  If you can\u2019t be bothered to provide a clean and decent house/apartment to split rent for, you could at least let her live there for free so she can save up to escape her dirty living conditions.  You\u2019re her mother for heaven\u2019s sake and you\u2019re wanting her to pay to live in your filth?  Oh and most hoarders don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2018that bad\u2019.  Trust me - it is. \nYTA"]}
