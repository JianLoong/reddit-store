Why should she pay half when the home is filled with all your things? \n\nCharging her rent? Fine, no problem there. But if she doesn\u2019t have full use of half the space in the home yet, then remedy that before you charge her, or adjust the rent % accordingly.\n\nEditing to add that it sounds like there might be some hoarding going on.\n\nOP, if you read this, this is a great opportunity to make some changes! I\u2019d encourage you to 1) allow your daughter to help if she is still offering and 2) talk to a therapist.

She has asked me to get rid of things so she can make space for her items and I have not done so yet, as am I very tired from work and find it hard to clean up when I come home.\n\nBased on this, and OP's additional comment that admits the house is cluttered and messy because of OP's things AND that she doesn't want her daughter to clean it up because her daughter would just throw things out, I'm going with YTA.\n\nSo you want her to be your tenant when it comes to the money and splitting the rent like an unrelated roommate would, but your understanding daughter when it comes to your mess and clutter?\n\nNo, sorry, it doesn't work that way. Either she's an equal tenant with you who pays half the rent and you clean up the common spaces to be respectful of your roommate, or she's your daughter who perhaps has to deal with the mess in exchange for either free or significantly reduced rent.\n\nSo which do you want? You can't have both.", "Edit: Based on OPs other comments, judgment changed to YTA. You do not treat her has an equal so you have no business expecting her to pay equally.\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nIs she an equal tenant? That is, does she have the same private space? Same ability to use the shared spaces (including equal say in decorating, when/how things may be used, etc)? Same ability to come and go as she pleases or to have guests over?  In short, as far as the two of you are concerned, do you act as parent/child or roommate/roommate?\n\nIf everything else is truly equal, than N-T-A, she certainly should be contributing an equal amount. However, it is often the situation that a parent will \"pull rank\" and make the majority of decisions about the space and how the house is run. If that's the case, she should be paying less because she has less.", "Info: does she have as much space as you? Does she have empty rooms for her and her stuff? She definitely needs to pay rent but I\u2019m not sure it should be half", "YTA\n\nI'm changing my judgement upon reading OP's comments elsewhere that the house is very cluttered and messy (giving off Hoarder vibes), and that OP's daughter has asked repeatedly for space to put some of her things but OP refuses to do so, citing being tired after work.\n\nIf you want her to pay rent, she should get a liveable space and it doesn't sound like that's what she's getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of that information was included in the original post, hence the revision.  Old judgement below for posterity\n\n\\--------\n\nNTA\n\nI hate this mentality that some millennials/gen z have of \"You're my parent(s), you have to fund my life forever!\".   Like yeah, the housing market sucks, everything costs a small fortune, student loans suck, and capitalism is hell, so moving back home into young adulthood is no longer rare - but where do y'all get off, thinking that you can not just move home, but do so rent/bill free?", "ESH - because of OPs comment. OP mentioned the house does not have enough space for the daughter to use as OP hasnt made room for the daughter. \n\nIf they both live there they both should be contributing but there needs to be respect and accommodation given.", "So could you pay for it on your own?   If so why don\u2019t you want to set your daughter up to succeed? She doesn\u2019t have any place for her stuff but pays half the bills.  She wants to get her own place but can\u2019t save while paying half.  Asking her to pay some rent is fine but paying she much she can\u2019t ever move - if you can afford the rent yourself- is not being a good mom IMO", "Wow, that edit is crucial info to leave out OP. \n\nSetting aside that as a parent, you should try to do what's best for your child, and allow her to save as much as possible since you don't need the money... If you want to treat her like a roommate instead of your child when it comes to finances, then you have to actually treat her like a roommate when it comes to living arrangements too. That means she needs equal say over the space. If you won't or can't do that, it's wildly unfair to charge her half the rent. So if she doesn't have the same control over the space as you, and you won't even clean some of your mess or give her enough space for her things, then yes absolutely **YTA.**", "INFO:  What percentage of your daughter\u2019s take home pay is half the rent?\n\nIt\u2019s in thing if she\u2019s paying 15% of her take home pay for rent. It is a completely different thing if she is paying 75% of what she makes on rent.", "YTA she has no space why should your daughter pay half when all your 'clutter' (hording) is taking up the entire house", "Well\n\nMy mom charged me for 1/3 of the rent while I was a working student (!) and I had no say in decorations etc apart from my room. This was a total no go tbh as it took a lot of saving opportunities away from me and led to quite a lot of anxiety - in the years before, she barely invested the child support into me -\n\nYour daughter works full time so she will have more money to spend but if you charge her for half, she needs a space she is not embarrassed by (regarding your other comments) and where she can bring people over. So fix the space, then you can charge half of the rent. If you can't fix it, don't charge half. \nSo currently YTA", "N T A\n\nShe's 25.  If she were living on her own she'd be paying the *entire* rent.  This arrangement does potentially allow her to save money.\n\nEdit:  Ohhh, from OP's comments this sounds like a hoarding situation.  She has no room to put any of her belongings because OP won't clean the admitted \"clutter\" and refuses to have anything thrown away, just moved around into different piles.  Daughter offers to clean (which includes removing some of the mess) and is rebuffed.  So the daughter doesn't have anywhere *near* equal access to the living space.\n\nESH she should be paying some amount of rent. But the mess needs to be properly acknowledged and dealt with. I grew up in this kind of situation and I get that it's a difficult thing, but this isn't good for anyone.", "NAH - I think there are two ways of looking at it. Is it equally her place as much as yours? Can she redecorate, have dates stay over, ask you to get your dishes out of the sink? Or is it more your place that you are in charge of and she's staying there? If you're the one more in charge of the place then I don't think it is fair to have her pay a full half.", "NTA. She shares your living space, it's perfectly reasonable for her to pay a fair amount. 50/50 sounds pretty fair, hopefully she helps with chores as well. She is allowed to \"save her money\" but you aren't? Just because you're her mom? Well you're a person, too.\n\nEDIT: I wrote NTA under the assumption OP takes care of her own place. If the place is a mess and the daughter doesn't even have access the some of the space due to junk, then no she definitely shouldn't be paying for half and you should learn to clean up after yourself. Plenty of people are tired from work and find time to clean, you don't need to do everything at once.", "Yta, i am all for kids paying half or part of the bills since usage is a factor but rent is fixed and you didn't move to a bigger place to accommodate both of you, it's the same accommodation. So this rent is something you would have to cover anyway plus it's less than expected so why not help her by not charging her rent? She is not wasting her money but saving it.", "ESH.\n\nShe should not be paying half if she doesn't have equal control over the whole place.\n\nCharge her market rate for renting out one bedroom.", "NTA\n\nShe is an adult. If she wants to live with you, she needs to pay rent. \n\nIt would be different if she had just finished school at 18 and on a low paying job due to no experience, but she is 25 and needs to start acting like it.", "NTA.

Why don\u2019t you take the time to clear out your mess (since this is a repetitive argument) and show her your open to making the home work for the both of you. You can\u2019t not clean up after yourself and not make room for her things and guest to come over bc your to tired from work and still expect her to want to pay half of everything. Is this going to be a parent/child situation or a roommate situation you can\u2019t have it both ways. Someone paying half of everything in the home deserves to be able to enjoy the home. If you really can\u2019t clean up after yourself and she can\u2019t enjoy her home like someone who\u2019s paying half of everything maybe you should try a compromise 60/40 split or she pays all utilities and groceries and you pay rent. I think it\u2019s disgusting your asking someone to pay half of something they can\u2019t use bc you.", "NTA.\n\nI don't know what is fair or not regarding rent with children but having her support you with some money for at least food, water, electricity and stuff is the bare minimum.", "NTA. Sounds reasonable.", "NTA. She\u2019s saving money by living with you, either way, if she can\u2019t afford to live alone.

That is most definitely fair. What is unfair is her expecting that you are going to fund the downpayment on her house, or her education. While it would be a very generous thing for you to do that, if you are financially able to, you certainly aren't obligated.\n\nAs to your edit, though, now you absolutely need to take responsibility for that. If there is so much clutter in the house that she can't bring her own things in, and she feels that she can't invite people over, that is a huge problem. If this is a space where she is paying half of the rent and she can't actually comfortably live there due to you being \"very tired\" and unable to clean the space, that is on YOU.", "She's an adult who is living with you.

Since a major part of your conflict with your daughter is about your clutter, you are not currently managjng the condition well. \n\nTo get you started, hoarding disorder is staged level 1 through 5. The houses that make it on the tv shows are levels 5+. Your description of the living space and conflict with daughter sounds like level, maybe 2-3. That is no health or safety problems, but also excessive clutter. Little to no free surfaces or spaces, and those that are free are only free because they're being used regularly. Excess spending/collecting of new stuff even though there is no space for new stuff. Clutter/collecting having a harmful effect on personal relationships and causing/contributing to social isolation. Excuses/deflection when asked to clean, confront the clutter, or throw things away.\n\nAnd, look, no judgement about the disorder intended here, provided you face your problems and do something about it. I have an inherited risk of hoarding disorder. My grandmother was a hoarder, and my mom reacted in extreme opposite because of her trauma about her mother's hoarding. I know i have to be on constant guard to prevent myself from developing the disorder. It's easy to slip into the patterns without realizing it, especially if you manage to avoid the worst stages so that it's just clutter and not health or safety problems.

How do you wipe down surfaces if all of the surfaces are covered? How do you vacuum and dust?

When most of the floor and all of the surfaces are covered, there is simply *no way* to get that grime up from where it\u2019s landed. Dust attracts dust mites, dust mites attract things that eat dust mites. There is a 0% chance you don\u2019t have any bugs in your house. Even normal, tidy homes get bugs occasionally.

You don\u2019t get to treat her like she\u2019s a dependent while expecting her to pay as an independent. THAT is the difference.", "So I have read your comments and concluded that:\n\n-\tyour daughter had a period where she lived rent free, after being an adult\n-\tyou are not a hoarder albeit perhaps a bit messy, papers and what not\n-\tyou can afford the bills on your own and do not need your daughters payments to support your home or living \n-\tyou did not financially support her at all, but did give her a space to live in, once again, after being an adult, but with rent this time \n-\tyou are saving a decent amount of money currently if you could afford the rent/mortgage before her\n-\tyour COL is lower than rent in the area and your daughter cannot currently afford to move out \n\nSo with all that said, here\u2019s my take.\n\nI think, as a parent, you should sit down with your daughter and outline what the future looks like for her at your current rate of charge. And by that I mean, with her debt for college and bills, how much is she actually saving. Especially in regards to how much you are saving by having her there.\n\nYou are saving money right now with her being there, and probably a good bit of you could afford the rent/mortgage with her. You have extended her a courtesy to live there. And sure, she is in many ways better off for the fact that she has an affordable place to live vs the higher cost of living which she cannot likely afford. \n\nHowever. How much are you saving? Because while you\u2019re daughter can \u201cafford\u201d to live there, because she cannot afford elsewhere, that means she is likely not saving much. And she is paying off student debt. I would be curious if you were in a position yourself where you had that kind of debt incurred to pay off.\n\nAlso you are asking 50/50 which would be fair of a roommate to ask, and is fair when you consider the cost of living that she can\u2019t afford, but ultimately you are her parent. And you should be working to help her save within her means, if for no other reason, then so that she CAN move out and move forward with her life.\n\nI can\u2019t help but read this and think that you are convincing yourself you have given your daughter and yourself a good gif by allowing her to find a cheaper place she can afford while she saves a little and you save a good bit. But the reality is she is working and going to college and is trying to save to be a functional adult hopefully without long term debt. And while she might not be able to afford to live out in town, the other reality is if she did live in an apartment with a roommate who she split rent with 50/50 it would be expected that she could expect a level of cleanliness from both parties and an allowance to use all the spaces.\n\nSo what I\u2019m getting at here is, are you actually *supporting* your daughter and trying to help her financially move forward and achieve better in her life within as much as you can afford? Or are you trying to \u201ctreat her like an adult with good luck\u201d and charge her 50/50 rent because that is more convenient for you?\n\nFrom one parent to another, it doesn\u2019t really sound to me like your goal here is to actually *help*your daughter move forward with her life, as much as you can financially and spacially \nallow.\n\nIt sounds to me like you are trying to act like you are helping your daughter, while benefiting from financial disparity, by using the excuse that she is an adult and it could be worse. That\u2019s not what parents do to help there children.\n\nObviously you can\u2019t live outside your means to support your children. But that\u2019s not what it sounds like is happening here. You are benefiting from your daughter living with you. Meanwhile she is fighting debt, while working hard at work and at college, while trying to avoid being homeless.\n\nI think you should take a long hard look at what being a PARENT to your child means. Not a provider. Maybe you should sit down with your child, and really look at her income and and how much she is lying in bills currently and how long it would realistically take her to save to be in a more secure place. Preferably without asking her to forfeit all her money to bills and have no life outside of it, when it sounds like you do afford to help her out even a little bit more.\n\nAs a parent, I don\u2019t want my child to stress SO hard over finances that they can even afford a coffee or a hobby, if i could afford to do so. That\u2019s what I have worked so for. I want my children to learn financial responsibility of course, but I also want them to enjoy their lives and not be on the money grind from the minute they turn 18.", "NTA She is an adult and should be able to afford her own place and is frankly lucky to have a parent who is willing to share their personal space with her.\n\nTo start telling you to tidy up is entitled and ungrateful, unless of course she stumps up half the rent and you become room mates", "NTA.
