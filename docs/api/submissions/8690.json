You are \u201ctoo tired\u201d after work to move some of your stuff so your daughter can actually live in the space as an equal tenant.\n\nWhy are you too tired to move your stuff but not too tired to cash your daughter\u2019s checks?", "I\u2019m going with YTA\u2026you said in the comments she doesn\u2019t even have enough room for HER things in the house. Why should she pay half when the home is filled with all your things? \n\nCharging her rent? Fine, no problem there. But if she doesn\u2019t have full use of half the space in the home yet, then remedy that before you charge her, or adjust the rent % accordingly.", "In case this gets buried in the comments later, here's a [follow-up comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p55w6/comment/j6idaza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from OP:\n\n>I think it is important to mention that she does not bring people over ever as she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d at the state of the house.

She has asked me to get rid of things so she can make space for her items and I have not done so yet, as am I very tired from work and find it hard to clean up when I come home.\n\nBased on this, and OP's additional comment that admits the house is cluttered and messy because of OP's things AND that she doesn't want her daughter to clean it up because her daughter would just throw things out, I'm going with YTA.\n\nSo you want her to be your tenant when it comes to the money and splitting the rent like an unrelated roommate would, but your understanding daughter when it comes to your mess and clutter?\n\nNo, sorry, it doesn't work that way. Either she's an equal tenant with you who pays half the rent and you clean up the common spaces to be respectful of your roommate, or she's your daughter who perhaps has to deal with the mess in exchange for either free or significantly reduced rent.\n\nSo which do you want? You can't have both.", "Edit: Based on OPs other comments, judgment changed to YTA. You do not treat her has an equal so you have no business expecting her to pay equally.\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nIs she an equal tenant? That is, does she have the same private space? Same ability to use the shared spaces (including equal say in decorating, when/how things may be used, etc)? Same ability to come and go as she pleases or to have guests over?  In short, as far as the two of you are concerned, do you act as parent/child or roommate/roommate?\n\nIf everything else is truly equal, than N-T-A, she certainly should be contributing an equal amount. However, it is often the situation that a parent will \"pull rank\" and make the majority of decisions about the space and how the house is run. If that's the case, she should be paying less because she has less.", "Info: does she have as much space as you? Does she have empty rooms for her and her stuff? She definitely needs to pay rent but I\u2019m not sure it should be half", "YTA\n\nI'm changing my judgement upon reading OP's comments elsewhere that the house is very cluttered and messy (giving off Hoarder vibes), and that OP's daughter has asked repeatedly for space to put some of her things but OP refuses to do so, citing being tired after work.\n\nIf you want her to pay rent, she should get a liveable space and it doesn't sound like that's what she's getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of that information was included in the original post, hence the revision.  Old judgement below for posterity\n\n\\--------\n\nNTA\n\nI hate this mentality that some millennials/gen z have of \"You're my parent(s), you have to fund my life forever!\".   Like yeah, the housing market sucks, everything costs a small fortune, student loans suck, and capitalism is hell, so moving back home into young adulthood is no longer rare - but where do y'all get off, thinking that you can not just move home, but do so rent/bill free?", "ESH - because of OPs comment. OP mentioned the house does not have enough space for the daughter to use as OP hasnt made room for the daughter. \n\nIf they both live there they both should be contributing but there needs to be respect and accommodation given.", "So could you pay for it on your own?   If so why don\u2019t you want to set your daughter up to succeed? She doesn\u2019t have any place for her stuff but pays half the bills.  She wants to get her own place but can\u2019t save while paying half.  Asking her to pay some rent is fine but paying she much she can\u2019t ever move - if you can afford the rent yourself- is not being a good mom IMO", "Wow, that edit is crucial info to leave out OP. \n\nSetting aside that as a parent, you should try to do what's best for your child, and allow her to save as much as possible since you don't need the money... If you want to treat her like a roommate instead of your child when it comes to finances, then you have to actually treat her like a roommate when it comes to living arrangements too. That means she needs equal say over the space. If you won't or can't do that, it's wildly unfair to charge her half the rent. So if she doesn't have the same control over the space as you, and you won't even clean some of your mess or give her enough space for her things, then yes absolutely **YTA.**", "INFO:  What percentage of your daughter\u2019s take home pay is half the rent?\n\nIt\u2019s in thing if she\u2019s paying 15% of her take home pay for rent. It is a completely different thing if she is paying 75% of what she makes on rent.", "YTA she has no space why should your daughter pay half when all your 'clutter' (hording) is taking up the entire house", "Well\n\nMy mom charged me for 1/3 of the rent while I was a working student (!) and I had no say in decorations etc apart from my room. This was a total no go tbh as it took a lot of saving opportunities away from me and led to quite a lot of anxiety - in the years before, she barely invested the child support into me -\n\nYour daughter works full time so she will have more money to spend but if you charge her for half, she needs a space she is not embarrassed by (regarding your other comments) and where she can bring people over. So fix the space, then you can charge half of the rent. If you can't fix it, don't charge half. \nSo currently YTA", "N T A\n\nShe's 25.  If she were living on her own she'd be paying the *entire* rent.  This arrangement does potentially allow her to save money.\n\nEdit:  Ohhh, from OP's comments this sounds like a hoarding situation.  She has no room to put any of her belongings because OP won't clean the admitted \"clutter\" and refuses to have anything thrown away, just moved around into different piles.  Daughter offers to clean (which includes removing some of the mess) and is rebuffed.  So the daughter doesn't have anywhere *near* equal access to the living space.\n\nESH she should be paying some amount of rent. But the mess needs to be properly acknowledged and dealt with. I grew up in this kind of situation and I get that it's a difficult thing, but this isn't good for anyone.", "NAH - I think there are two ways of looking at it. Is it equally her place as much as yours? Can she redecorate, have dates stay over, ask you to get your dishes out of the sink? Or is it more your place that you are in charge of and she's staying there? If you're the one more in charge of the place then I don't think it is fair to have her pay a full half.", "NTA. She shares your living space, it's perfectly reasonable for her to pay a fair amount. 50/50 sounds pretty fair, hopefully she helps with chores as well. She is allowed to \"save her money\" but you aren't? Just because you're her mom? Well you're a person, too.\n\nEDIT: I wrote NTA under the assumption OP takes care of her own place. If the place is a mess and the daughter doesn't even have access the some of the space due to junk, then no she definitely shouldn't be paying for half and you should learn to clean up after yourself. Plenty of people are tired from work and find time to clean, you don't need to do everything at once.", "Yta, i am all for kids paying half or part of the bills since usage is a factor but rent is fixed and you didn't move to a bigger place to accommodate both of you, it's the same accommodation. So this rent is something you would have to cover anyway plus it's less than expected so why not help her by not charging her rent? She is not wasting her money but saving it.", "ESH.\n\nShe should not be paying half if she doesn't have equal control over the whole place.\n\nCharge her market rate for renting out one bedroom.", "NTA\n\nShe is an adult. If she wants to live with you, she needs to pay rent. \n\nIt would be different if she had just finished school at 18 and on a low paying job due to no experience, but she is 25 and needs to start acting like it.", "NTA.

NTA to expect money.\n\n\"She has asked me to get rid of things so she can make space for her items \"\n\nThen you should, since she is paying for 1/2 of the apartment.", "ESH.. Why don\u2019t you take the time to clear out your mess (since this is a repetitive argument) and show her your open to making the home work for the both of you. You can\u2019t not clean up after yourself and not make room for her things and guest to come over bc your to tired from work and still expect her to want to pay half of everything. Is this going to be a parent/child situation or a roommate situation you can\u2019t have it both ways. Someone paying half of everything in the home deserves to be able to enjoy the home. If you really can\u2019t clean up after yourself and she can\u2019t enjoy her home like someone who\u2019s paying half of everything maybe you should try a compromise 60/40 split or she pays all utilities and groceries and you pay rent. I think it\u2019s disgusting your asking someone to pay half of something they can\u2019t use bc you.", "NTA.\n\nI don't know what is fair or not regarding rent with children but having her support you with some money for at least food, water, electricity and stuff is the bare minimum.", "NTA. Sounds reasonable.", "NTA. She\u2019s saving money by living with you, either way, if she can\u2019t afford to live alone. It\u2019s not your job to pay for her housing so she can buy her own place.", "Originally N T A but changed to ESH after the edit. She's an adult with a job, she needs to pay rent. That is most definitely fair. What is unfair is her expecting that you are going to fund the downpayment on her house, or her education. While it would be a very generous thing for you to do that, if you are financially able to, you certainly aren't obligated.\n\nAs to your edit, though, now you absolutely need to take responsibility for that. If there is so much clutter in the house that she can't bring her own things in, and she feels that she can't invite people over, that is a huge problem. If this is a space where she is paying half of the rent and she can't actually comfortably live there due to you being \"very tired\" and unable to clean the space, that is on YOU.", "She's an adult who is living with you.

She is 25, it sounds like you have supported her through her education.\n\nBUT.  You can't have it both ways.

You don't seem to care about her and resent her, you won't give her an opportunity to move out, you won't let her live in the same space equally and expect her to contribute equally. None of this is fair and you come across like a leech. This whole situation is very unfair to her. Do better. YTA.", "Then it\u2019s a bit much to expect her to pay 50% rent for a space she can\u2019t even fully use, stay warm in, or bring people over to, especially when she\u2019s planning on continuing her education. PROPERLY maintain your apartment and turn up the heat if you want her to contribute.\n\nOr let her keep living there so she can continue saving and planning for her future, which most parents are happy to do for their kids when possible.", "She\u2019s embarrassed, not \u201cembarrassed.\u201d No need to try to minimize her feelings by putting quotation marks around them. Living with a hoarder is embarrassing and uncomfortable. She can\u2019t have friends over and she probably finds it difficult to relax in the house. I was going to go with NTA, but expecting her to pay half the rent for an unsanitary house is unreasonable. And, honestly, being able to see the floor is a pretty low bar. That\u2019s hoarder talk.", "OP\u2019s daughter can\u2019t use the common spaces with all of mom\u2019s stuff. OP even states that \u201cthere\u2019s room to walk\u201d which a statement I would say about a slightly messy home", "Why is the house cold??? If it\u2019s below 65 degrees inside, then why isn\u2019t the furnace on? You aren\u2019t easy to live with if the home is a mess and too cold for comfort. If you aren\u2019t a hoarder then your important papers should fit into 3-4 file boxes, which you can keep in your bedroom. If there are more papers than that, then you are a hoarder and they should all be tossed out.", "But if your stuff is all over the place she can't use half the place can she?", "Then pull your weight in terms of cleanliness and turn up the heat. Any other housemate wold expect that of you.", "How can you say you want her to pull her weight when you aren\u2019t pulling yours??? The fact she\u2019s too embarrassed to have people over because of your mess is the definition of not pulling your own weight, you won\u2019t clean up after yourself. YTA.", "I don't care if I'm down voted. If someone doesn't like their living conditions (space and financial terms) they can change that. Her daughter can get roommates that way. Am I going to do this with my daughter no? But if she's still living with me she will abide by established rules. If she doesn't like it then she knows what to do. But I'm also not asking advice of internet strangers.", "If that's what op chooses to do then yes. Isn't this sub always like nobody owes you shit?", "Sounds like daughter needs her more than she needs daughter.", "She's a lodger then.  And lodgers pay some rent, but not half.  \n\nI have been both a roommate and a lodger.  As a lodger I had my things in my bedroom and a cupboard in the kitchen, but the rest of the house was my landlady's and I had no say over decor or what was there.  That's the arrangement OP and her daughter have, so yes the daughter should pay some rent but not half.", "It's kind of a standoff. \n\nExpecting to be treated as an equal tenant while not paying anything is what makes the daughter an ah. Maybe ESH.", "I have seen hoarding houses, I am messy but I\u2019m not dirty and unclean.", "She was at her first university supporting herself using her student loans for school and living along with her job she had at the time. This is not her childhood home, we moved around a lot as she was growing up. \n\nThis is an affordable situation for her and allows me to also save money. I\u2019m not opposed to helping her and I am helping her and have helped her by allowed her to live here rent free from 2019-2022.", "Her daughter is working, saving, and wanting to do household chores but OP won\u2019t let her. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s sat at home being waited on hand and foot.", "the question was if she was an AH for asking for 50%. She had the right to set whatever rules she wants of course; I agree asking for *something* makes sense, but 50%?   \nParent's shouldn't play the role of scummy landlord to their children, i figure, and when they do it makes them assholes.\n\nits not the \"am I within my rights\" reddit, it's the \"am I the asshole\" reddit. A person can do something that is fully within their rights and still be assholes, at the end of the day.", ">If someone doesn't like their living conditions (space and financial terms) they can change that\n\nThis isnt always a possibility for everyone. Given that OP:\n\n1. Admits they live in a high cost of living area \n\nAnd 2. Admits that the house has 0 room for daughter to live in\n\nSeems the daughter is stuck living in a place that has no space for her to actually *live* in due to, most likely, hoarding/slob tendencies. Shes *trying* to change her circumstances, but isnt there yet.\n\nOP has no right to charge half of the rent for an apartment that is 90% her things. If she wants to charge rent, she either needs to clear her own sh!t out, or she needs to charge based on how much space the daughter *actually* gets.", "Yes, I'd agree she's a lodger, if anything. If daughter is a lodger, it's fine to charge her something, but definitely not half.\n\nThing is, from OP's comments, it's unclear if OP's home would be considered acceptable living conditions to even rent to a lodger. If the home is unreasonably hoarded to the point where daughter genuinely can't have guests or make use of standard common use facilities, daughter shouldn't have to pay until the hoarding/clutter is remedied. OP doesn't have special rights to abuse her lodger because of a blood relationship.", "Crazy how you\u2019d expect a mother to behave as an adult regardless of if her child was. If she wants her daughter to take responsibility for herself then that lesson starts with modeling that behavior.", "the hoarder houses that are on those TV shows are very extreme. you can be a hoarder without there being bugs and feces. untidy non hoarders don't need to say things like 'there is space to walk' and 'well we don't have bugs' to justify the state of our houses. how would you feel about throwing one thing away?", "My mum is a hoarder.  Her house isn't dirty, there's no bugs.  But she has a lot of \"stuff\" (we call it stuff because there's no other word for it all; it's not useful or valuable, it's just there).  \n\nIf you can't sit down without moving something, if you have a dining table but have no space at it to eat, if you have to pick a path through the home instead of using the majority of the floor space that doesn't have furniture over it, if you have to climb over things to get into and out of bed, then you're a hoarder and you need to seek out professional help.", "Your daughter is embarrassed of the state of your house and doesn\u2019t have enough space in all the clutter. That\u2019s hoarding. It takes many forms. Lack of feces is a very low bar and nothing to be proud of.", "I think you\u2019ve seen the worst of the worst of hoarder houses. Those shows don\u2019t pick heavily cluttered homes  that aren\u2019t disgusting. They pick the worst ones to make better tv. If you have shit that you haven\u2019t used in over a year, you don\u2019t need it.", "Just because your house isn\u2019t a worst case scenario like those on tv, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you aren\u2019t a hoarder. Hoarders can be clean, have order in their stuff.

Clear your shit out.", "It\u2019s your crap. You clean it.", "Also crazy to think that a cluttery parent means you can live at home rent free as a capable adult. Crazy world.", "Because hoarders can\u2019t part with their messes, sadly. It would be a temporary solution anyway. OP would just start new piles and messes once the old ones are gone.", "Mom (OP) has been letting her stay rent free, but also lives in what sounds like a hoarding situation. How come the daughter has to suck it up and deal with it and clean up after mommy AND pay rent? Entitled on OPs end.", "I guess I find OP to be an unreliable narrator based on her leaving this out. IME people that fail to acknowledge stuff like that up front aren\u2019t always being as honest about the situation as they could be.", "You\u2019re a hoarder. And you\u2019re asking her to pay equal rent in your messy ass place. YTA.", "You can be a hoarder without having feces or bugs on the floor.
