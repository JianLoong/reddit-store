She said \"next day\" and didn't call you the next day, or tell you when she was coming by. She expected you to leave a vehicle crashed in your pasture indefinitely. Could you have called her? Sure. But did she come by after the wreck to let you know it was there (assuming it didn't just happen an hour or so earlier)? Did she attempt to return your call or text you to tell you that she was delayed and would be picking it up on a different date? Nope. She was entitled enough to expect you to car-sit with the wreck in your pasture for an indefinite amount of time. Should you have called her again before towing it? Probably, but she already hit the Rude Threshold for not showing up when she said she would and not calling you to let you know, so, eh. Not worried about that.

Less time if it's in the roadway. After that the county has it removed. She is lucky only 1 day of fees, could of been 13 days.", "NTA at all. How entitled are people...\n\nShe has not right to have anything there for any amount of time. She should have talked to you about not coming to get it immediately and assumed it wasn't a parking garage lol.", "Obvious NTA", "NTA. She should be grateful you didn't get it towed 2 weeks ago. I don't know where they would take it (the police impound?) but the parking fee would be VERY expensive.", "She left it for 14 days? She's lucky you didn't have it towed, the storage fees would be insane. NTA.\n\nI hope she's paying to repair the fence and field. I remember how much damage the neighbor did when he drove a truck through our pasture fence.", "Nta obviously, you don\u2019t even have the responsibility of alerting her personally, I would have just gone through the police.", "NTA.  Normally the police have it towed they day.  It\u2019s your property.  You can even go through their insurance to have your property fixed due to damages done by them.", "NTA you did everything you should have and more. They should have called after not picking it op when she said they would.", "Two weeks with zero attempt at communication?

You should have handed her an invoice for storage of the vehicle.", "NTA, However I feel like you might be in other situations. Question, are those roads around your house public and for public use? If they are why would you say someone shouldn\u2019t drive so close to you? If they are not public roads are they clearly marked somewhere?", "NTA but you could have at least called the owner one more time before getting it towed", "She said a family member stole her car and wrecked it she probably didn\u2019t know where it was gosh I think y\u2019all brains are fried if y\u2019all jump to conclusions and think y\u2019all know everything", "They didn\u2019t go through the fences thank god, just stuck to the road all the way to my drive way, then through my yard and over the hill directly behind my house.", "They are marked as private property at the three entrances. I pay the leases and taxes. There is one public fire trail that come through about 2 miles south of my house. Besides that the public roads end about 5 miles away. They had to drive ten miles down a dirt road, turn at a private property entrance. Drive past the public fire trail and continue up my drive way, drive through my yard and up over the hill directly behind my house to get to where they went.", "I called her right after it was found, it had only been there 1-4 hours before it was found. She knew where the car was from that point. She is familiar with the land area.", "According to OP, she said she would be coming to get it the next day when confronted then waited 2 weeks without any notice.", "I'm sorry what is the logic on this? Someone calls you to tell you where your stolen car is and you... Don't get the address? After saying you'll be there the next day? Let's assume that did somehow happen, \"oh I'm such a scatterbrain\", you don't call back the number that called you to get the address? Your family members who took the car? The police who would have the report with the location? Or maybe it was a logistics issue, you couldn't coordinate the next day, those three resources are still there to contact OP to at the very least let them know the new plan. You really have to stretch to find a conceivable scenario where they didn't do any of these things for a legitimate reason over the course of two weeks and didn't inform OP of said reason as an excuse when they got there", "Good!
