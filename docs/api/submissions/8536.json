She said \"next day\" and didn't call you the next day, or tell you when she was coming by. She expected you to leave a vehicle crashed in your pasture indefinitely. Could you have called her? Sure. But did she come by after the wreck to let you know it was there (assuming it didn't just happen an hour or so earlier)? Did she attempt to return your call or text you to tell you that she was delayed and would be picking it up on a different date? Nope. She was entitled enough to expect you to car-sit with the wreck in your pasture for an indefinite amount of time. Should you have called her again before towing it? Probably, but she already hit the Rude Threshold for not showing up when she said she would and not calling you to let you know, so, eh. Not worried about that.

I don't know where they would take it (the police impound?) but the parking fee would be VERY expensive.", "She left it for 14 days? She's lucky you didn't have it towed, the storage fees would be insane. NTA.\n\nI hope she's paying to repair the fence and field. I remember how much damage the neighbor did when he drove a truck through our pasture fence.", "Nta obviously, you don\u2019t even have the responsibility of alerting her personally, I would have just gone through the police.", "NTA.  Normally the police have it towed they day.  It\u2019s your property.

You had an \u201cimplied\u201d agreement she would come get in the next day\u2026her words. She violated that agreement.", "NTA. You should have handed her an invoice for storage of the vehicle.", "NTA, However I feel like you might be in other situations. Question, are those roads around your house public and for public use? If they are why would you say someone shouldn\u2019t drive so close to you? If they are not public roads are they clearly marked somewhere?", "NTA but you could have at least called the owner one more time before getting it towed", "[removed]", "They didn\u2019t go through the fences thank god, just stuck to the road all the way to my drive way, then through my yard and over the hill directly behind my house.", "They are marked as private property at the three entrances. I pay the leases and taxes. There is one public fire trail that come through about 2 miles south of my house. Besides that the public roads end about 5 miles away. They had to drive ten miles down a dirt road, turn at a private property entrance. Drive past the public fire trail and continue up my drive way, drive through my yard and up over the hill directly behind my house to get to where they went.", "I called her right after it was found, it had only been there 1-4 hours before it was found. She knew where the car was from that point. She is familiar with the land area.", "According to OP, she said she would be coming to get it the next day when confronted then waited 2 weeks without any notice.", "I'm sorry what is the logic on this? Someone calls you to tell you where your stolen car is and you... Don't get the address? After saying you'll be there the next day? Let's assume that did somehow happen, \"oh I'm such a scatterbrain\", you don't call back the number that called you to get the address? Your family members who took the car? The police who would have the report with the location? Or maybe it was a logistics issue, you couldn't coordinate the next day, those three resources are still there to contact OP to at the very least let them know the new plan. You really have to stretch to find a conceivable scenario where they didn't do any of these things for a legitimate reason over the course of two weeks and didn't inform OP of said reason as an excuse when they got there", "Good! I was imaging a great big hole in your fence that wasn't found until morning \ud83d\ude33", "Well then there you go, pretty dumb of them.", "nta", "NTA. You found her name and number called her. I\u2019m assuming you exchanged info at this point, so she\u2019d have yours.\n\nThat being said, if you wanted to be considerate, you could have called again before towing. \n\nSeparately, There were points in my life I wouldn\u2019t have had money to get a tow until I got paid.  But regardless, that on her to figure out and communicate.\u201d", "48 hours in my state, but 2 weeks is still way past that.", "NTA I know it\u2019s different for different countries and states, but where I live, the car\u2019s owner is notified when the vehicle is towed. I think it\u2019s suspicious that she came a day after the vehicle got towed, and I\u2019d be willing to bet she went through the rigmarole to make you feel guilty. You didn\u2019t mention her asking you for money, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was fishing for you to pay the tow bill.", "Nta.  It's her job to move it after the wreck.  Not yours", "NTA. You went out of your way to find her and tell her to get the car. She said she would be there the next day and then didn't show up for 2 weeks. \nNot your problem. Most people would have called a tow the same day to have it removed from their property.", "NTA! Wtf did that lady expect especially if she did not even bother to communicate with you. Two weeks was long enough.", "Yessss!!!! The guilt trip she attempted to lay. \u201cIt my only form of transportation for work. Thanks to you my kids no longer have a car to ride in.\u201d Surprisingly she didn\u2019t ask for money, she hung up but the guilt was laid on thick until I said, \u201cSorry, there is nothing I can do but this is the tow company\u2019s name and number.\u201d", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You'd still be within your rights, but morally an asshole, if the owner had been keeping you posted and letting you know they were trying to arrange removal. But treating you as a free scrapyard for two weeks? Nope.", "NTA", "INFO: when you say \"two weeks,\" do you mean it was two weeks between her asking you to keep it a day and her actually coming to get it, or it had already been two weeks when she asked so you had it towed?", "The crash happened on the 12th, when I talked to her she said tomorrow which would\u2019ve been the 13. I had it towed on the 27th. So I guess it was two weeks after she told me she would pick it up.", "Nope. The owner of the car could have called.", "Oh, yeah, no, definitely NTA", "IKR", "NTA you waited 2 weeks beyond what she told you, and she clearly could have called you back for an update if she was having trouble getting a trailer.

She should also berate full that you didn't chefs her 2 weeks of storage for said vehicle.", "That's hilarious on so many levels: So she can't get the car back from the towing company? And what about the previous 2 weeks that she could not use that form of transportation? And her loss is thanks to YOU, not about the idiots that crashed the vehicle (who presumably were those same kids who no longer have a \"car to ride in\")? Or maybe it was the extra special gravitational pull at the bottom of your little cliff, that you should REALLY warn people about?  I mean, yeesh... \n\nNTA, and you should really charge her for two weeks of parking!", "op=NTA\n\nDid she show up the next day? No. \n\nDid she communicate with you about the delay?  No\n\nDid you owe her anything? No\n\nThat you called her at all was a kindness.", "NTA. I might have made a second phonecall, but you didn't even owe her the first one. Lots of people would have asked the sheriff for the paperwork to have it towed when the first reported it.", "NTA and I would start putting truck no trust pass signs all around your property so that shit doesn\u2019t happen again. Add some cameras while you\u2019re at it.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe said she'd come by the next day to get it. She didn't. 2 weeks later, you called the tow truck. I would have called them from day one.", "Typically that doesn't apply on private property. They could let it stay indefinitely or have it towed immediately. It's their land.\n\nI am actually more concerned here it is called a pasture which kind of indicates that it is inhabited by some sort of livestock. Was a fence damaged? Is their fluids from the vehicle all over the land? Both of those require money to fix.", "She needs to take all that up with the relevant family member \ud83d\ude44", "Not just a parking fee. What about a charge for the trespassing? Why were they even on her property?", "Nta. I'd have towed it in less than a week.", "I think I'm an outlier on this but ESH.  If the car owner said she was going to get the car the next day, she should have.  But things happen and if she couldn't,  she should have communicated that.  But I also think OP should have called and told her if you're not here by tomorrow, it's getting towed.  Which is OPs right because it's on their property.  A phone call would have very easily solved this for both of them.", "Next day or two weeks later are two different stories she should have informed u", "I would have asked her why she didn\u2019t get the car right away if she needed it so bad. And it\u2019s not like you sold it, you had it towed to a safe place, off your property, so not sure why she is suggesting that she no longer has a car just because you got it towed. Maybe there is more to this.. Was the car unregistered? Full of illegal paraphernalia? About to be repossessed ? Who knows. Not your problem.  NTA."]}
