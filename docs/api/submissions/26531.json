My mom (52) and I (20F) have never had a close relationship. This didn\u2019t honestly bother me because I was close to my dad who was basically my best friend. However, my dad passed away 4 years ago. I was depressed and my mom wrapped herself in her work and I was left to basically raise my 5 younger siblings. Although I love them, it was never good for my mental health and I was also stressing over my schooling and college applications. I ended up getting into my dream college but my first year, I went to a regional campus so I could be close to my siblings which was actually my mom\u2019s idea. My second year I moved to the main campus which was two hours away. I never realized how weighed down I was by my family. My depression got so much better and I was happy and made new friends. \nDuring my senior year of hs however, my mom decided she wanted to start dating again. I wasn\u2019t very happy as I didn\u2019t want anyone stepping in and trying to act like my dad. I had already had one. Last year though, my mom met someone and got engaged. Her fianc\u00e9 is nice and she is happy which I am glad but some of my siblings and I are still struggling with my dad\u2019s death and it\u2019s hard.\nThe past month she has been discussing the wedding more and more with me which is a bit of a sensitive issue with me which I don\u2019t think she understands. \nLast week she asked if I could stay the week of her honeymoon to watch my siblings. I didn\u2019t give her an answer because I really don\u2019t want to but I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. After talking with one of my brothers and my SIL, they told me that I really isn\u2019t my job to watch them and I need to focus on me as I have been much happier when I am not with them which I know sounds horrible. I realized they are right and decided to tell my mom I couldn\u2019t babysit. The next time she called me, I told I was busy that week and would be leaving to go back to school right after the wedding so I couldn\u2019t babysit. I hoped she would drop it but instead she kept asking me why and I said I had tickets to my college\u2019s football game which was not a lie. She said that was stupid and she thought I would stay especially since I would be on break. I realized that she had looked up my school schedule and planned her honeymoon on my fall break so I would be home. I wasn\u2019t planning on going home because I have a job and planned on working that week. \nAfter freezing me out for the first week expecting me to cave which would not have been the first time, she has been calling me nonstop which I have been ignoring. I now feel bad and I don\u2019t know if I am wrong. This isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. My brother and SIL have considered going no contact with her because she just causes stress and chaos for them. I have considered the same. I moved out over the summer and it was the decision I have ever made. Pls help.
