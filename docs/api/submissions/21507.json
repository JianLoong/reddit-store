Your mom and J are correct that you are being disrespectful. No one is asking for you to love this guy like your biological father, but complaining about him referring to you as his child or about him raising you is nonsense. Because let\u2019s be honest here, if this guy has been in your life since you were five, there\u2019s no way he forced your mother to handle all the parental duties over a decade. You just don\u2019t like the guy, and that\u2019s okay, but you still need to be respectful. At the same time, they shouldn\u2019t be badmouthing your biological father to you, especially if he\u2019s still in the picture, acting as a dad to you, hence my ESH ruling. \n\nOne more thing:\n\n>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m disrespecting him by saying the truth\n\nYou\u2019re conflating truth with your personal opinion.

I think it's possible he is doing more for you as a 'father figure' than you are giving him credit for. For instance if he works, presumably he is contributing to the household finances, which means it is partly because of him that you have food, shelter, clothing, and so on. I can understand why, if he's been steadily in your life, living in a shared home, since you were 5, he has the perspective that he does. I see it as mostly a positive and considerate sentiment that he doesn't refer to you any differently than he does his biological children, so that you aren't 'othered'... generally that's a good thing, but it's like you're seeing it as deceptive, which doesn't seem fair to him. \n\nBut you don't need to feel that your biological father is being replaced. You should not be called names, and it seems very misguided for either your mother or stepfather to bad-mouth your biological father. You can have good relationships with both.", "Yes, YTA. \n\n\"all he was to me growing up was a freeloader whose lived in my house since I was 5. he goes to work, comes home, plays on his PC for hours until going to bed and repeating it all the next day.\"\n\nDoes he not use his paycheck to pay for the family? Rent, food, activities for you and your siblings? Hard to see the freeloader argument. \n\nYou say you never liked him, and that you tell him all the time that he isn't your dad, but he's still the man that stuck around, provided financially to take care of you and your family, and keeps trying to build a relationship with you. You don't need to start calling him \"dad,\" but you also don't need to be a brat and constantly tell him he isn't your father. \n\nWhat exactly are you saying feels unfair? Who is it unfair to? To your bio-pops? BC it sounds like step-dad has done more for you than bio-pops. It isn't a competition, but paying for a kid for a decade isn't nothing either, and he makes your mother happy it seems. It just isn't clear from what you've written why you have such a negative reaction to him treating you like family. Many people in your shoes wish they were included in this way.

You probably don't even remember those moments and maybe that's why he's so distant now. We don't have another point of view, so it's difficult to judge the situation correctly.
