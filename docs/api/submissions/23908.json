He did a shitty thing, there a married couple, they can sort it out between themselves (and maybe couples council). It's non of your business, it's not your marriage.", "She didn't hide anything, the husband is the one lying. I think you are confused about the situation being described.", "He did do a shitty thing, but he also tried to emotionally manipulate her along with saying horrible things about other women. Normally, if this type of thing happens once and the person stays, it will FOR SURE happen again because they think they can get away with it because their partner didn't leave the first time and it can escalate into even worse behavior.  Better to get out the first time instead of sticking around to be hurt again even worse. \n\nAnd I speak from personal experience with these types of people, I stayed, and even 5 years later I'm having issues despite therapy.", "*\u201dIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d the person typed, on the internet forum, where the OP asked strangers for their thoughts, after describing an issue in her marriage.* \n\n*Anyway.* OP, your husband is, at the very least, a narcissist. Look up DARVO. Your husband literally checked every box. \n\nOh and NTA.", "LOL its those classic \"break up now!\" Comments from these lunatics", "I think it was a typo. But who\u2019s counting.", "I'm not trying to break them up. I'm asking why someone op doesn't and probably never will know is telling them how to live their life.", "I believe they were telling you that the person you responded to was a lunatic. Your point had been both fair and well written \ud83d\udc4a", "I think you misunderstood me. \nI am agreeing with you lol", "Violently agreeing"]}
