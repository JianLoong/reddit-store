As a result, I found it difficult to afford gifts or celebrate my girlfriend's birthdays for the past 3 years. Although she never complained, I knew she deserved to be celebrated on her special day. Determined to make it up to her this year, I promised to take the day off and spend quality time together.\n\nWhen her birthday arrived, she expressed that all she wanted was a simple celebration: dining at a modest restaurant, playing billiards, and going bowling afterward. We started by having a meal at a restaurant before heading to a game hall for a game of billiards. However, upon arrival, all the pool tables were occupied, and we had to wait for our turn for about 30 minutes. While waiting, my girlfriend noticed a small indoor airsoft range adjacent to the pool hall. She suggested we try it to pass the time, and I agreed. Having paid for both activities we then proceeded to the indoor range. Unfortunately, the airsoft guns turned out to be faulty, which was frustrating. Nevertheless, I decided to make the most of it.\n\nWhen it was my girlfriend's turn to play, she promptly expressed her unwillingness to continue due to the faulty guns. I was initially disappointed, but in the end, I decided to play her turn as well. While she opted out of the airsoft game, I asked her to check if the pool table was ready, and after a few minutes, she returned with the cues and balls, confirming that it was now available.\n\nI continued with the airsoft game, and by the time I finished, it had already been 20 minutes past the allotted time for our pool table reservation. When I finally joined my girlfriend at the pool hall, she was visibly upset. Despite this, we started playing, but eventually, she abruptly left the game hall without saying a word. This infuriated me, and I confronted her, expressing my frustration about her behavior and how she seemed to waste my money. I suggested that if she intended to leave, she should have been the one to pay for the activities she canceled.\n\nFeeling hurt and angry, I decided to distance myself from her, walking ahead to the car to avoid saying things I might regret. When she joined me in the car, she burst into tears and explained her reasons for leaving. She said she felt overwhelmed and embarrassed playing pool by herself while all the other tables were occupied. She also added that she felt uncomfortable because seated in front of our pool table was a family waiting for their turn to play. She said the \u201cdiscomfort of being observed\u201d only added to her embarrassment.\n\nFirst, she canceled on her turn to play at the indoor airsoft range. Then she decided to walk out while we played pool, both of which I had already paid for. It made me feel like she wasted my money.

You played all of the faulty airsoft. She played 20 min of pool. The pool unplayed is your fault, but I have to know: how much money does she owe you for you ruining her bday? \n\nIt sounds like you really resented paying for everything on her bday, and you want reimbursement for the money you didn\u2019t want to spend to begin with.", "YTA.\n\n>I decided to play her turn as well.\n\nWhy? If you knew the guns were faulty, what's the point of playing!? You should have joined your girlfriend at the pool table instead of making her wait for 20 MINUTES!? She's the birthday girl, it's supposed to be about her and you made it about not wasting money.\n\nShe was understanding with you when you weren't able to afford gifts for 3 years and you're mad at her and made her cry on her birthday for \"wasting money\" on an airsoft game with faulty guns and a pool game?

It doesn\u2019t take a lot of money to celebrate special occasions. This about you being a crappy BF. You don\u2019t seem to understand that your number 1 job is to enjoy spending time with your GF.

Hopefully she finds someone who appreciates and enjoys spending quality time with her.", "YTA - you are absolutely obsessed with getting every penny worth of the money you spent.

If guns were messed up you could have gotten a refund and stopped.\n\nYou wasted your own money and are an idiot", "You're the absolute biggest gaping A-hole!", "Info: does anyone have a link to the girlfriends side?\n\nEdit: YTA.

While it's understandable that you felt frustrated, your reaction was harsh and insensitive. \n\nBirthdays can be emotionally charged, and your girlfriend's feelings of embarrassment and discomfort should have been met with empathy and understanding, not blame.\n\n Instead of lashing out, try having a calm conversation about your feelings and find a resolution together.", "Did you think the establishment was going to hold the pool table until you were finished playing by yourself?

You posted and people have voted. Your GF posted and people voted. By the overwhelming majority, YTA. Instead of reflecting on your actions you have made multiple comments trying to justify your actions. Stop!! Take a moment to realize you are in fact the AH.

Your rebuttal makes you an even larger AH.\n\nSome sage advice from someone who was more concerned about money that anything else when I was younger:  \n\nlearn the true value of money vs people and experiences.  Give up counting every dollar and feeling like you have to \u201cget your money\u2019s worth\u201d out of everything you pay for if it comes at the expense of some one you care about or missing out on an experience you can\u2019t get back.\n\nYou had one chance to celebrate your gf birthday.  For all you know if could have been your last chance (no one is guaranteed a future and things happen).  And you blew and ruined that one chance because squeezing the value out of every dollar was far more important.\n\nMoney can be made and replaced.

I call \"writing assignment\".", "Right?!", "She didn't 'suddenly change her mind'.  She was understandably upset because you ruined the outing by making her wait 20 minutes at the pool table while you messed about with a faulty Airsoft that wasn't even part of the original plan.", "I hope she realizes how shoddy of a person you are and dumps you because I can only imagine how you\u2019ll be if you were to get married and have kids.", "Then why did you waste the pool playing time fucking around with malfunctioning air soft guns?", "Somehow I get the feeling the pandemic isn\u2019t the only reason your business has suffered. You don\u2019t want your money to go to waste, but you spent 20 out of your 30 minute pool table time playing airsoft by yourself instead of the activity your girlfriend specifically chose. \n\n*You* are the reason your money went to waste, not her.", "If this was about money-consciousness, you'd have asked for a refund on the airsoft. This was about sticking it to your GF.", "She didn't change her mind. You blew it when you made her play pool by herself for 20 minutes while you played with the faulty airsoft guns. YTA!!!", "Exactly this. My ex-husband (amicable divorce) and I started dating at 17. We both had hardly any money but every birthday or special occasion, we always found a way to make each other feel special. You don\u2019t need to spend money to show you care.", "Exactly. But you need to not throw a passive-aggressive tantrum. Omg dude. YTA and she deserves so much better than you.", "You are terribly stupid, OP. No wonder your business is struggling with money. YTA.", "YTA you're awful.", "its that twilight from edward's perspective book, but a reddit post", "These were both poorly written by the same bad writer for sure", "You freaked out over 10 bucks dude, get a fucking grip.", "at least it's not another \"and then a mom asked me for my nintendo switch\" story", "Good lord, that's four Sunday newspapers. Extravagant!", "There is a post from her? Please link!"]}
