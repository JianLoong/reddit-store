Since I\u2019m a student and heavily involved at my school, I don\u2019t have much time to work and I work less than 10 hours a week. The week before this incident was my senior prom, and while my significant other paid for most of the expenses, I still had to pay for my dress, prom tickets, etc, which left me with less than $100 in my general bank account. I\u2019m also planning on switching jobs soon, and my boss decided to put me on fewer hours because of this, so I don't get paid as much as I did before. \n\nMy Dad (54m) is currently working a high-paying job at a big company. Every day he comes home and he keeps working, which I don't mind. I end up doing a lot of the cleaning up and he does the cooking. Another detail I should add is that I am graduating high school very soon, and due to my involvement in the school, I have a lot of work to do for many different things. The night before the incident, I was swamped with a lot of homework from school and I didn\u2019t have time to do a lot of cleaning around the house. My Dad had also ended up falling asleep after he came home from work, and before I went to bed, I woke him up and told him the time. I don\u2019t know what happened after I woke him up however, as it was already close to 1 in the morning and I was exhausted. \n\nThe morning of the incident, my Dad woke me up 3 hours before I had to go to school (he goes to work at 7, and I wake up at 7). For some context, later in the day, my grandma is flying in from Mexico, and I thought that I could just finish cleaning after school since that day I get home much earlier than he does. He yells at me asking why I didn't clean everything and why I didn't wake him up. I tell him that I had homework to do and I did wake him up, but he says I was just talking back. Immediately after this, he asks me for $900 because a debt collector took that out from his paycheck. This is where I drew the line. I had less than $100 in my general account, and I have around $600 in savings, which in total adds up to not even $700. I tell him this and he starts calling me a horrible daughter, and how he raised me for nothing. After a few more minutes of these comments, I end up caving in and giving $200 from my savings account. He says he\u2019ll pay me back, but he doesn't exactly have the greatest track record for paying people back.
