She's newly married, so I don't know if it's a nesting thing or what.\n\nSaturday is my daughter's birthday, and I organized a party for her. She's turning four, and I invited everyone.\n\nMy sister decided to organize a dinner right after the party for \"mother's day\" so she doesn't have to, in her own words, \"drive all that way twice\". She lives 30 mins away..\n\nAnyway, she made the reservation. She told us. I said uh sorry no, that's my daughter's birthday, and even if her party is over at that time, we are going home and my daughter is going to enjoy her ENTIRE birthday. (She's four, so I'm sure she will want to go home and open all her new toys), and they don't need me there if they want to do their mother's day time with our mom the same day. \n\nI can see our mom on actual mother's day.\n\nFor some background they do this a lot. My sister's son (8M) gets the WHOLE family at his soccer games, but no one comes to my daughter's gymnastics. I made big plans for Easter, which included inviting them to an Easter Fair specific to kids with sensory issues. (My daughter is autistic). They showed up late, missed the entire hunt, and left after only a few minutes because everyone made plans for the zoo last minute, and then guilted ME for not wanting to go. They treat my daughter like being little and autistic means she's incapable of getting her feelings hurt or that shes not able to see when they're doing this.\n\nShe has babysat for me literally barely a handful of times. When her son was little I watched him CONSTANTLY while she went out. My in laws family knew him better than her in laws, because I was always forced to either bring him with me or cancel plans. She left me with him, after I said no, at my own bridal shower because she had a date (with her now husband).\n\nAnyway, it turned into a HUGE argument with my family, my sister left the family group chat. I got called selfish by literally everyone. \n\nApparently my sister was making some kind of announcement at this dinner, and her husband was busy on actual mother's day. \n\nI said, \"I don't care, pick a day that's not my kids birthday. I'm busy the WHOLE day, not just the length of the party.\"\n\nNoone is speaking to me now. And likely no one is coming to my daughter's birthday at all.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThank you everyone for all the support. It makes me feel a lot better, especially since the smear campaign is still ongoing.\n\nI blocked the number of the main FM (my older brother, 40), cancelled the arcade reservation, and decided to take the few people who were coming to Knott's Berry Farm! The price shakes out to about the same, and I can contact their accessibility department for resources and guides for the special needs kids. I think this is going to go way better. My mom is ditching the mothers day dinner \"for her\" and coming with us because she said my daughter's birthday is more important than another mother's day, so I'm feeling really good about that. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1683526976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bg4gt/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_daughters/", "score": 4922, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They obviously were not unable to care for themselves and that's the reason why they were had been living with you (as evidenced by the fact you bought them a home of their own) but I wonder why it was *your* job to do so at all.
