She's newly married, so I don't know if it's a nesting thing or what.\n\nSaturday is my daughter's birthday, and I organized a party for her. She's turning four, and I invited everyone.\n\nMy sister decided to organize a dinner right after the party for \"mother's day\" so she doesn't have to, in her own words, \"drive all that way twice\". She lives 30 mins away..\n\nAnyway, she made the reservation. She told us. I said uh sorry no, that's my daughter's birthday, and even if her party is over at that time, we are going home and my daughter is going to enjoy her ENTIRE birthday. (She's four, so I'm sure she will want to go home and open all her new toys), and they don't need me there if they want to do their mother's day time with our mom the same day. \n\nI can see our mom on actual mother's day.\n\nFor some background they do this a lot. My sister's son gets the WHOLE family at his soccer games, but no one comes to my daughter's gymnastics. I made big plans for Easter, which included inviting them to an Easter Fair specific to kids with sensory issues. (My daughter is autistic). They showed up late, missed the entire hunt, and left after only a few minutes because everyone made plans for the zoo last minute, and then guilted ME for not wanting to go. They treat my daughter like being little and autistic means she's incapable of getting her feelings hurt or that shes not able to see when they're doing this.\n\nShe has babysat for me literally barely a handful of times. When her son was little I watched him CONSTANTLY while she went out. My in laws family knew him better than her in laws, because I was always forced to either bring him with me or cancel plans. She left me with him, after I said no, at my own bridal shower because she had a date (with her now husband).\n\nAnyway, it turned into a HUGE argument with my family, my sister left the family group chat. I got called selfish by literally everyone. \n\nApparently my sister was making some kind of announcement at this dinner, and her husband was busy on actual mother's day. \n\nI said, \"I don't care, pick a day that's not my kids birthday. I'm busy the WHOLE day, not just the length of the party.\"\n\nNoone is speaking to me now.

You yourself said they don't treat her like a 4 year old should be treated.", "It\u2019s possible that this is a long-established pattern, and that you\u2019re breaking it by prioritizing your family above your sister: Your sister is the entitled child (now adult), and she gets what she wants. And your family is punishing you for not going along with what she wants. It may have little to do with your daughter? \n\nEither way, your family comes first, and your daughter\u2019s birthday is more important that your sister being inconvenienced by having to drive 30 minutes. What family doesn\u2019t put a 4 year old\u2019s birthday above a whiny grown woman, anyway?", "N TA.  It sounds like your sister wants to control everything. Good job standing your ground for your daughter. It sounds like she's already not being treated well.  Continue to love and protect her.  That's all you can do.", "NTA for wanting to give your daughter a whole day to celebrate her birthday. And besides, she's 4. After her party she's going to be wiped out, amped up, or both, and almost certainly not in any shape to be going to a restaurant for a nice meal. Heading home for some time with her new toys in her own space with only her people around her, and where she can pass out if she needs to from all the stimulation, is really going to be what she needs. (Is what I was going to say before I saw that she was autistic. Now I want to say it twice, because that goes double for neurospicy kids)", "NTA. Good for you", "NTA. you're a good mom :)", "It may be a lot to assume but this whole situation  just sounds like a family that couldn\u2019t be bothered with a medical diagnosis of Autism.\n\nI know families just like this, the \u201cit\u2019s not Autism it\u2019s just a phase\u201d group that will straight up ignore medical fact because they can\u2019t be bothered to alter their lifestyle or be inconvenienced in any way whatsoever.\n\nTo acknowledge the child has autism would be admitting they are the ones failing you and your daughter, because they\u2019re perfectly capable of changing their lifestyle to accommodate her but simply refuse to. Some people will do anything to avoid placing the blame on themselves.\n\nEven if they acknowledge the autism, it legitimately seems like they think it means she doesn\u2019t matter, like at all.\n\nThey seriously might have such an ignorant level of understanding of autism to the point they think everyone with autism is \u201cchecked out\u201d or \u201cnot there\u201d and so they think their actions won\u2019t matter \u201cbecause she won\u2019t remember anyways\u201d, completely ignoring how autism is a spectrum and people who are diagnosed with it have a vast range of functioning between \u201cwouldn\u2019t know it unless they told you\u201d to \u201cin need of full time professional medical assistance\u201d. Just sounds like a family that is uncomfortable around mental disability and is expressing it via action rather than words.\n\nNTA. That\u2019s just my read on this situation, but then again, this is from a very limited perspective with limited information from OP only.", "NTA. Just had a convo on another post where we were talking about child neglect form parents, but other family affects them as well. Your daughter's feelings should be all that matters to you. Ask her what she wants to do and go from there. Either way I don't think you are an asshole because you're looking out for her. And if no one shows up for her birthday party (if i've got this right the parties are on two separate days), then they are the assholes. Support should be shown to all family as much as possible.", "NTA, your sister and family ATA. They don\u2019t treat you two of your kids equally and expect you to bend over backwards for others but won\u2019t do the same for you. Standing up for your daughter was 1000% right, you stood your ground and protected your daughter.", "OP, unfortunately you could cover yourself in gold dust and You will Never be the Golden Child. \n\nNTA, but sister-poo is a ginormous anal orifice.", "NTA.\n\nBirthdays are special occasions. end of.\n\nI'm unsure on your family dynamics now (together/separate/single etc). but when you start a family you become your own 'new' family unit (think about it from the eyes of the child). Cultures globally treat this differently, but (for example) in Australia you tend to catch up with immediate and extended family members on special occasions everyone gets (christmas/easter etc.). Weekly gatherings are great (I try to do it with my parents) but if something's up, it doesn't happen.", "So, NTA for not wanting to go. \nHowever, you can\u2019t expect them to not continue to have dinner after the party without you, and it sort of sounds like you demanded they move it.

They've used even those phrases \"checked out\" and \"not there\" just because she didn't like to talk around them until really recently. \n\nBut they should know better because they know *I am autistic too, and all they've ever done when I was younger was tell me that I was too smart. But I didn't get diagnosed until adulthood, because they thought I was just weird and being smart meant I couldn't be autistic. And now it's like the opposite, they think my daughter being autistic means she couldn't possibly be smart. \n\nBut she IS. \n\nShe's reading, she can add and subtract, she is learning multiplication, she plays the piano, she's in gymnastics. And she's only turning 4. And they treat her like she's incapable of understanding how hurtful they're being, all because she doesn't like eye contact and she doesn't do much speaking around them. She understands, and she's now getting to the age where she's going to remember. \n\nAnd I don't want that to be the first birthday she remembers, where she gets dragged out of the house away from playing with her new toys, right around her bedtime, just to go to some random mother's day dinner that didn't need us there and could have waited until it was actually mother's day.", "The parties are the same day, they're both the day before mother's day. \n\nMy daughter's is noon to 5, the dinner is at 8pm. But everyone is angry with me, And they always find the smallest reasons to be busy when my daughter has something, so I just know they will say they didn't come because of this fight.\n\nMy daughter has been talking about nothing but her birthday all week. I voluntarily forfeited my own mother's day with her so she could see her dad and his family on that day and get the full birthday experience. I just know if I try to drag her to a family dinner after her birthday party and pull her away from all her new stuff she'll be devastated. \n\nAnd knowing now that there was going to be a huge announcement makes it worse, because then she would be sharing her birthday with my mom for mother's day AND my sister with whatever her news is.\n\nShe's so excited for her party, and now my own family might not be coming, and I just feel awful.", "I told them they could go, I just wasn't coming.", "You truly aren\u2019t an asshole OP. You\u2019re a loving parent and only want the best for your child I\u2019m sure. Family is the asshole for not showing up considering the time differences. If I was you though I\u2019d ask your daughter what she wants to do. That\u2019s the most important thing."]}
