Especially if his person isn't even attempting to train him.  But going into a room?  The only way to reliably keep even the best behaved cat out of a room it isn't meant to be in is to close the door.  Training them to stay off of specific counters is possible, but they really are not like dogs in this regard.  Especially in a place where they haven't been for very long.  There are air burst horns which can eventually teach a cat to *fear* a room, but that's really not preferable to just closing doors.\n\nShe can't be intentionally bringing him or encouraging him to enter the kitchen.  If there's a door to the kitchen, then there's no reason he should ever be in there.  And *she* should have been watching the cat if she's so worried.  Your priority is your toddler.\n\nYeah, definitely do not leave a toddler unattended on a changing table.
