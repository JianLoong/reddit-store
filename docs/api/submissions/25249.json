You've told her the cat isn't allowed in certain rooms, and for sure you're not leaving a toddler unsupervised on a bed, so that he can get injured rather than her cat.\n\nHow much longer is she staying? At this point I'd tell her she **has** to buy (at her expense) guards for the kitchen and bedroom doors so the cat cannot come inside to protect cat and abide by the rules.", "NTA.

She has rules. Doesn't want to follow them? She can bring her entitlement and her cat to a hotel.", "NTA, not your job to watch the cat, you have your child! You should ban the cat to the room that your sister is sleeping in, let her take care of it.", "I really love cats but NTA. What were you supposed to do? The cat jumped out the window on its own. He probably knew what he was doing. Considering he's fine, your SIL needs to get over it. She needs to be more responsible with the cat in preventing him from going into the rooms you don't want him in if she wants to keep him safely out of trouble.", "NTA. How about SIL follows the rules of YOUR house in the first place and if she doesn\u2019t then she can get the F out.", "NTA. Should've tossed SIL out the window to get her cat so they could find someplace else to stay.", "NTA - you have a toddler to watch.\n\nThat being said - the only way to ban a cat from a room is to shut the door or install a VERY tall gate. There is a reason they do not have Cat obedience competitions.", "NTA. And you should clearly put your foot down on some points. Talk to your husband, so you are both on the same page and then confront SIL. She has to follow your rules as long as she lives here and so has her cat (by the means a cat can understand - so mostly your SIL has to look after the cat). And if she is not willing to do so, the cat has to go. Maybe a shelter while your SIL is staying with you, maybe with a friend or your SIL also has to move out. Point.\n\nYour house, your rules.", "NTA, her cat her responsibility, you were already taking care of your toddler and you made it clear to her that the cat shouldn't be there.", "NTA\n\nJumping out of windows is what cats do and usually they know pretty good if they can savely reach their destination. There needs to be a serious threat that a cat would make such a jump instead of going back, especially if the alternative is to just stroll back where they come from. \n\nHonestly, keep the cat and remove the SIL :D", "She's responsible for her cat, you're responsible for your baby.

If she can't behave and follow your rules and treat you and your husband better then she needs to go.\n\nYour not responsible for her cat.
