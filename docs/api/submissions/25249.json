At this point I'd tell her she **has** to buy (at her expense) guards for the kitchen and bedroom doors so the cat cannot come inside to protect cat and abide by the rules.", "NTA.

She has rules. Doesn't want to follow them? She can bring her entitlement and her cat to a hotel.", "NTA, not your job to watch the cat, you have your child! You should ban the cat to the room that your sister is sleeping in, let her take care of it.", "I really love cats but NTA. What were you supposed to do? The cat jumped out the window on its own. He probably knew what he was doing. Considering he's fine, your SIL needs to get over it. She needs to be more responsible with the cat in preventing him from going into the rooms you don't want him in if she wants to keep him safely out of trouble.", "NTA. How about SIL follows the rules of YOUR house in the first place and if she doesn\u2019t then she can get the F out.", "NTA. Should've tossed SIL out the window to get her cat so they could find someplace else to stay.", "NTA - you have a toddler to watch.\n\nThat being said - the only way to ban a cat from a room is to shut the door or install a VERY tall gate. There is a reason they do not have Cat obedience competitions.", "NTA. And you should clearly put your foot down on some points. Talk to your husband, so you are both on the same page and then confront SIL. She has to follow your rules as long as she lives here and so has her cat (by the means a cat can understand - so mostly your SIL has to look after the cat). And if she is not willing to do so, the cat has to go. Maybe a shelter while your SIL is staying with you, maybe with a friend or your SIL also has to move out. Point.\n\nYour house, your rules.", "NTA, her cat her responsibility, you were already taking care of your toddler and you made it clear to her that the cat shouldn't be there.", "NTA\n\nJumping out of windows is what cats do and usually they know pretty good if they can savely reach their destination. There needs to be a serious threat that a cat would make such a jump instead of going back, especially if the alternative is to just stroll back where they come from. \n\nHonestly, keep the cat and remove the SIL :D", "She's responsible for her cat, you're responsible for your baby.

If she can't behave and follow your rules and treat you and your husband better then she needs to go.\n\nYour not responsible for her cat.

Ed takes the dive, and she looks over and says \"You're jealous he's done with the movie, aren't you?\"", "\"The cat IS NOT my responsibility and I will not be watching it.

She really expected you to choose her cat over your baby?", "Well I mean, the cat is going to go in a room if you leave it open...\n\n\nNTA for not catching it, but you seem weirdly sure that if you tell a cat 'not this room/kitchen' it'll say, of course human!\n\nCats are a good preparation for crawling / walking babies/toddlers.", "NAH but I recommend you have a serious talk about a) when is she moving out and b) cats do not listen in the same way dogs do, so it will not be an easy thing to keep the cat away from things or out of rooms immediately. I recommend shutting the door to any room the cat isn\u2019t allowed, and lightly spraying with water when needed. \n\nit\u2019s also weird that you include \u201cthe cat follows her everywhere\u201d and \u201cshe got upset that my husband almost STEPPED ON THE CAT\u201d as negative things. shadowing a human means the cat loves her. stepping on the cat could hurt or kill it. of course she\u2019s going to say something.", "NTA- You are responsible for your toddler safety. She's responsible for her cat safety.\n\nThen she should make sure the cat is not in places that the cat should not be.\n\nAnd is there anywhere else in the world she can stay?", "Of course you are NTA.  Your baby is your responsibility and the cat is your SIL's.  If she is being snotty, maybe it's time her visit ends.

Lol", "I think she must have opened the door to come get something. I know I closed it behind me because my little one likes to escape changing time", "I feel as though spraying this woman would be far more helpful than the cat, especially as she's opening doors into rooms and letting the cat into places it isn't allowed and blaming other people for it escaping.", "I did.
