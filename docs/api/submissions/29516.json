{"id": 29516, "submission_id": "17elavc", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my brother because of how disgusting he is?", "selftext": "I (16 F) and my brother (15 M) moved into a new house 5 years ago. Little back story, we used to share a bedroom and needed to move as we were getting to the age where we needed our own space. We were at the age where we didn\u2019t make much mess and sharing a room wasn\u2019t too difficult. \nAs we got older in the new house, he became messier. It started with his clothes piling up and his stuff was everywhere, but overall, not dirty. When he hit the age of 13, he started leaving dirty clothes in the bathroom, unwashed dishes in his room and not emptying his bin in his room. His personal hygiene was overall okay, he showered everyday and wears deodorant. He is now 15 and still showers everyday however his room is disgusting, the bathroom (which we have to share) is disgusting. He wears the same clothes for 4 days before he puts a new pair on however, doesn\u2019t put them on the landing for a wash. After the next 4 days has past, he puts the same clothes on from 4 days ago. This makes him absolutely reek. Now this is where i embarrassed him. His room is non of my business, but the bathroom is. I have to use that bathroom as the other is my parents ensuite. Now i have told him multiple times (as has our parents) that he needs to clean up after himself, especially in the bathroom, but he never does and no punishment has been given for his disgusting behaviour. Some examples of this his leaving his long hair in the sink, shaving his pubes in the sink (blocking it), not putting shitty wipes in the bin (leaving them on the floor next to the bin), leaving his hairy razors on the counter, not flushing the toilet, leaving piss on the toilet seat, spitting his toothpaste all over the tap and not wiping it off and so much more. So to finally punish his for things he has been doing for literal years, i made a snapchat story with all of his friends in, took pictures of his mess and dirt and posted it for them all to see. At first, no one cared, un till it got worse and his mates started laughing at him for his mess. Instead of him cleaning up after himself, or asking me to stop and taking effect on his mess, he cried to out parents and begged them to make me stop. Which they listened to and punished me for, making me take down the story and grounding me. Its been a few weeks and he still has not fixed his foul behaviour. I don\u2019t think i\u2019m in the wrong for taking action on something thats been going on for years. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: after reading comments and replying, i know that naming and shaming on the internet is far too harsh. i shouldnt have done that. but i dont know what to do next! i have tried everything! ive sucked it up and cleaned it, ive threatened with my own mess, ive spoken to my parents (hundreds of times), ive spoken to him even more times and non of it has even changed his behaviour! i cant not use this bathroom as its the only one available! And to clarify, i havent just been mad at him, im more mad at my parents for doing absolutely nothing about this. so please redit! give me other ideas or suggestions.

The bathroom is still gross, but at least he showers and brushes his teeth every day now. Anyway, I'm asking because sometimes people on the spectrum don't see hygiene as necessary and don't understand the social implications of being the stinky kid.
