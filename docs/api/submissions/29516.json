{"id": 29516, "submission_id": "17elavc", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my brother because of how disgusting he is?", "selftext": "I (16 F) and my brother (15 M) moved into a new house 5 years ago. Little back story, we used to share a bedroom and needed to move as we were getting to the age where we needed our own space. We were at the age where we didn\u2019t make much mess and sharing a room wasn\u2019t too difficult. \nAs we got older in the new house, he became messier. It started with his clothes piling up and his stuff was everywhere, but overall, not dirty. When he hit the age of 13, he started leaving dirty clothes in the bathroom, unwashed dishes in his room and not emptying his bin in his room. His personal hygiene was overall okay, he showered everyday and wears deodorant. He is now 15 and still showers everyday however his room is disgusting, the bathroom (which we have to share) is disgusting. He wears the same clothes for 4 days before he puts a new pair on however, doesn\u2019t put them on the landing for a wash. After the next 4 days has past, he puts the same clothes on from 4 days ago. This makes him absolutely reek. Now this is where i embarrassed him. His room is non of my business, but the bathroom is. I have to use that bathroom as the other is my parents ensuite. Now i have told him multiple times (as has our parents) that he needs to clean up after himself, especially in the bathroom, but he never does and no punishment has been given for his disgusting behaviour. Some examples of this his leaving his long hair in the sink, shaving his pubes in the sink (blocking it), not putting shitty wipes in the bin (leaving them on the floor next to the bin), leaving his hairy razors on the counter, not flushing the toilet, leaving piss on the toilet seat, spitting his toothpaste all over the tap and not wiping it off and so much more. So to finally punish his for things he has been doing for literal years, i made a snapchat story with all of his friends in, took pictures of his mess and dirt and posted it for them all to see. At first, no one cared, un till it got worse and his mates started laughing at him for his mess. Instead of him cleaning up after himself, or asking me to stop and taking effect on his mess, he cried to out parents and begged them to make me stop. Which they listened to and punished me for, making me take down the story and grounding me. Its been a few weeks and he still has not fixed his foul behaviour. I don\u2019t think i\u2019m in the wrong for taking action on something thats been going on for years. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: after reading comments and replying, i know that naming and shaming on the internet is far too harsh. i shouldnt have done that. but i dont know what to do next! i have tried everything! ive sucked it up and cleaned it, ive threatened with my own mess, ive spoken to my parents (hundreds of times), ive spoken to him even more times and non of it has even changed his behaviour! i cant not use this bathroom as its the only one available! And to clarify, i havent just been mad at him, im more mad at my parents for doing absolutely nothing about this. so please redit! give me other ideas or suggestions.

The bathroom is still gross, but at least he showers and brushes his teeth every day now. Anyway, I'm asking because sometimes people on the spectrum don't see hygiene as necessary and don't understand the social implications of being the stinky kid.

I used laundry hampers as an example of a related issue with the same root that others have experienced. I was thinking if y\u2019all had a bin with a lid, even a step trash bin, that y\u2019all would might want to consider a lidless one.", "Best of luck!", "I wouldn't do thst if I were you, that would only make you vulnerable to him revenge-shaming you.\n\nNext stage should be letzing not your brothers peers know he is disgusting but rather ldt your parents peers know they force you do endure such disgusting conditions. A facebook group or family group chat or the likes to let your extended family - your grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc, know what you have to deal with.", "What else had you tried? Kinda sounds like you got fed up and just went to this.", "Why?\n\nJust go inside and use it, or do your parrnts lock the door?", "I would for more argue for caution in this regard . It\u2019s more likely he is a slob definitely but it could come out that there are  some mental things that may be effecting him . \n\nThe parents are the biggest asshole here as wether it\u2019s a mental issue or a him being enabled to be dirty it still should have been sorted a long time ago .  I would also suggest to not do any more social shaming around the school to his friend  . These actions might have more adverse consequences long term than you would think . The best way is to shame the parents into effect as there really the only ones who can solve it . It\u2019s better to tell the parents friends and also uncles , aunts and grandparents who can discuss.", "Wouldn\u2019t it be way be better to just text their grandparents , aunties and uncles to talk to their parents about it before going nuclear about it .\n\nNot all parents are going to handle that well even though they should and it\u2019s better to be cautious giving this kind of advice to a 16 year old girl.", "You're right it's better to just let him leave feces on the ground. Surely he'll clean up his act by pure random chance", "they have \u201chad words\u201d, yes i would get grounded and yes, they are aware", "im in collage right now, its not the worst, it gets me out of this house", "the bin is open, its directly next to the toilet", "no ive tried talking, sitting doen with him and parents, talking to just him, talking to just parents, cleaning up after him, making him clean up. nothing has wored", "no. ive been made to use the neighbours bathroom before, its on a different floor so it\u2019s impossible to use as my parents are always up there.", "lock door", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 nowhere did I say that\u2019s acceptable. You just gave advice that won\u2019t solve anything.\n\nWhat\u2019s the continuation of your advice . She tells them he cried and he\u2019s a dirty weirdo and then he continues doing it as he is doing now . She then gets grounded again and it builds further and further resentment?  Secondly she\u2019s a 16 year old girl it\u2019s a big call and might further the cycle .\n\nThe biggest issue is the parents allowing the behaviour rather than the actual kid . It wouldn\u2019t be crazy to me if it comes out that he\u2019s depressed or something. The best thing to do is contact somebody in the family who can contend her to parents how disgusting it or the need to sort it out . Grandparents, older cousins , uncles and aunts etc .", "Changed to ESH.", "I mean obviously the deadbeats no longer being deadbeats would be ideal but I doubt they're gonna suddenly become parents after 15+ years of being lazy as fuck. Even with an intervention.\n\nIt's a start though at least \ud83e\udd37", "I love this. I can\u2019t understand why parents are not taking care of this problem. They need to really feel OP\u2019s pain.", "It\u2019s still awful advice . They might be what you consider deadbeats but things can get a whole lot worse for her with that advice without knowing the in and outs of everything.\n\nShe\u2019s 16 and we don\u2019t know what will happen if they kick her out . This is not a 18 year old girl who has money to move yet  . She has also expressed that she dislikes the treatment of the CPS .", "What do you mean that you\u2019ve \u201cchased them away multiple times\u201d? Please tell me that you don\u2019t mean CPS . . . do you? Because if so, there\u2019s a LOT more going on here than just your brother being a lazy slob.", "social services is what im meaning. ive had to chase them away from how theyve treated me, not my brother. laziness is whats happening.", "Does that mean that someone (or you) have previously had the social services come to your house because they were concerned? If so, what did they say was the concern about? What was the reaction? This is starting to sound like a pretty troubling situation, outside of your brother\u2019s behavior.", "im really sorry but this is a little too much for me to talk about on here. all that ill say is that CPS have been round my house and ive had to get rid of them by convincing them from their beliefs. i wont be calling them for my brothers actions as that is like a nuclear attack that doesn\u2019t need to be used."]}
