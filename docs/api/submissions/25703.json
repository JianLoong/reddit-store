I found out that she had cheated with me on multiple times with multiple guys, some who never knew I existed and one that I know of did, who she\u2019s also engaged to now (35M I think) \n\nWe also have a number of mutual friends, and I have always tried to maintain civil. However, earlier this year I went on a holiday with another female (42F) who is married, the three of us being her, husband and myself are extremely close (nothing sexual) \n\nBefore we went away I found out my ex\u2019s fianc\u00e9e had been spreading rumours that Anita (not real name) and I are having an affair, and are only going away so we can sleep together. I laughed it off because of how stupid it was to even suggest that, as that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never even thought of doing with Anita or her with me. One day on our holiday our train was massively delayed and I was in a foul mood, so I texted my ex\u2019s fianc\u00e9e with a few choice words telling him to stop spreading rumours or else. Anita then contacted my ex to tell her that my anger wasn\u2019t towards her but towards him. She asked me to send her a screenshot of the text. Which I did. We went about our holiday without a second thought \n\nWhen we came back, we found out from numerous people that my ex had been going around saying that I was bombarding her with text messages every day, stuff like I love and miss her. I didn\u2019t. As soon as I heard this I made the decision to not talk to her again and want nothing to do with her anymore. \n\nNow this is where I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the AH (sorry for length) numerous times she\u2019s tried to say hello to me in a friendly cheery manner, to which I have blatantly ignored. I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s complaining that I\u2019m being very rude to her, even though she and her fianc\u00e9e have been spreading lies about me. She\u2019s been asking mutual friends to get involved to tell me to be nice to her, but they already know where I stand. \n\nAITA?

See he didn't pay any attention to most of the details about the case however like the state or years any of this happened. I was pregnant with his child and we were most definitely not living in the state these crimes took place in. The only similarities between us is the fact that we share the same first and last name lmfao. So this idiot runs around telling everyone that I'm wanted for all of this stuff and I'll be arrested soon. Mind you I am still living in the original state (around 6 years later) he and I were living in while I was pregnant. He told all my family and friends to get ready to start writing to me in federal prison and all of this other wild crap. Now most of my friends knew it was BS since obviously if you googled the crime it brought up a picture of a woman who looked absolutely nothing like me. It got to the point that people would look at him like he was nuts. He even called to brag about how I was going down and \"oh my gosh I am so sorry. Guess I'll come pick up LO and she can live with me, it's too bad you're going to prison for so many years.\". He was homeless and couch surfing and I was granted full custody because my ex is a major addict. Mind you the podcast or Radio Show he listened to was talking about the trial as it was happening and the eventual sentencing of this woman. This man literally thought I was in and out of trial in another state and somehow managing to drive all the way back home daily so I could go to work. None of this made me mad but boy did I laugh. Constantly! It was the most hilarious thing and I'm not gonna lie I let him run around telling people and when they'd ask me point blank I'd tell them to Google it. He made himself look vindictive, dumb, and proved he was nothing but a shit talker and drama starter.
