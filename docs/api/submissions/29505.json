The only thing is they want to still send my daughter gifts and just know how she's doing from a distant. So I send them updates through email. Since getting diagnosis with cancer those updates are slightly more often. \n\nWell usually they don't respond except a month ago they made a replay saying what was happening with my daughter probably wouldn't have happened if we (my husband daughter and I) went to church more. Because of that, I stopped sending them updates on how my daughter was doing. \n\nThey sent a long email yesterday calling me some very mean names for not sending them any updates on their granddaughter. Well, I didn't respond but told my MIL and she said I acted like an AH because they deserve to know how their granddaughter is doing. I also asked a few close friends and they agreed with MIL.

The only thing is they want to still send my daughter gifts and just know how she's doing from a distant. So I send them updates through email. Since getting diagnosis with cancer those updates are slightly more often. \n\nWell usually they don't respond except a month ago they made a replay saying what was happening with my daughter probably wouldn't have happened if we (my husband daughter and I) went to church more. Because of that, I stopped sending them updates on how my daughter was doing. \n\nThey sent a long email yesterday calling me some very mean names for not sending them any updates on their granddaughter. Well, I didn't respond but told my MIL and she said I acted like an AH because they deserve to know how their granddaughter is doing. I also asked a few close friends and they agreed with MIL.

In Job's case God is not the one directly punishing Job but instead the book describes God removing his hedge of protection around Job and allowing the devil to do what the devil does: destroy.   \n\n\nYou're right that God punishes the Egyptians. I guess the question here is if God has the right to punish people who do evil things? They were enslaving His people after all. Another way to think about it is to imagine a god that takes no stance toward evil and does not condemn it in any way and never takes any action against it. I think we would be hard pressed to call that god a good and just god.   \n\n\nI think a more relevant passage of the Bible to this post is the beginning of John 9. I won't quote it at you, but you can look it up if you have the interest. Jesus's disciples ask Him if a man is blind because of his parents sin. Jesus's answer is not straightforward, which is on-brand for Jesus, but He makes it clear it is not the blind man's parents or even the the blind man him self's fault that he is blind.

The Devil, often referred to as Satan, was later added by Christians.)\n\nEssentially, YHWH praised Job for his piousness, and the angel said he wouldn't be so faithful if his life was shit, so YHWH let the angel screw Job over big time in order to prove him wrong.\n\nSo while YHWH himself wasn't the one who actually tortured Job, he did allow it to happen simply to prove a point, so he bears just as much responsibility.", "Yeah, it was a genuine question. I find that particular passage false simply because people **were** tried by YHWH (either directly or with his full consent).\n\nWith Job, while he didn't *directly* ruin the guy's life, he **did** allow it to happen, and merely to prove a point at that, so he bears just as much responsibility as the angel who did the actual deed.\n\nAnd in Egypt's case, it was the pharaoh who kept YHWH's chosen people as slaves, not the population as a whole, so punishing them for their ruler's actions is a total dick move. They were innocent in the whole mess.  \nHe should have punished the pharaoh alone.\n\nI do agree, however, that cases of illness or misfortune aren't always a punishment or trial from YHWH. Bad things *do* happen to good people for no reason. It sucks, but it is a fact of life.\n\nOP is definitely NTA, and the parents are horrible people to have said what they did. She's better off without them in her life."]}
