The only thing is they want to still send my daughter gifts and just know how she's doing from a distant. So I send them updates through email. Since getting diagnosis with cancer those updates are slightly more often. \n\nWell usually they don't respond except a month ago they made a replay saying what was happening with my daughter probably wouldn't have happened if we (my husband daughter and I) went to church more. Because of that, I stopped sending them updates on how my daughter was doing. \n\nThey sent a long email yesterday calling me some very mean names for not sending them any updates on their granddaughter. Well, I didn't respond but told my MIL and she said I acted like an AH because they deserve to know how their granddaughter is doing. I also asked a few close friends and they agreed with MIL.

They were innocent in the whole mess.  \nHe should have punished the pharaoh alone.\n\nI do agree, however, that cases of illness or misfortune aren't always a punishment or trial from YHWH.

Then we will be closer, you will be no longer brokenhearted and it will have all been down to the love of the Lord.\n\nFollow that one up with James 5:16 - \u201cTherefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.

The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?\n\nb) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in\u00a0Exodus 21:7\u00a0.

The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n\nd)\u00a0Lev. 25:44\u00a0states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n\ne) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath.\u00a0Exodus 35:2\u00a0clearly states hee s ould  be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n\nf) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination (\u00a0Lev 11:10\u00a0), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n\ng)\u00a0Lev 21:20\u00a0states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\nh) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by\u00a0Lev 19:27\u00a0. How should they die?\n\ni) I know from\u00a0Lev 11:6-8\u00a0that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n\nj) My uncle has a farm. He violates\u00a0Lev 19:19\u00a0by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them?

Please continue to stand your ground with your daughter and don't let toxic people like that influence your relationship with God. I have found that it's the non-denominational churches that are the most accepting so if you are looking for non judgey, I would look for non-denominational churches. \n\nYour daughter doesn't need toxic relationships in her life though.

Going NC was the kind thing you could have done in response.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m  a Christian.  Bad things happen to believers.  God does not promise a life free of problems.  God promises he will be there with us when problems happen.", "NTA\n\nBut you can send them updates while still blocking them from contacting you.  \n\nTheir toxic approach of using their own grandchild's illness to abuse their own daughter is sick beyond words, and they have created the conflict.", "NTA", "NTA.

If they wanted that relationship with you, they should have been better people.\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this nonsense, I'm sorry you don't get that strong familial support system that's helpful in trying times, and I am overwhelmingly sorry that your daughter has leukemia and you all are going through this.

He had major surgery while covid was happening (needed open heart FIVE BIPASSES) he has been dealing with health issues for a very long time, way pre covid, but my cousin had the GALL to tell me he wouldn\u2019t have needed it had he taken the first vaccine. Which he and my step mom both took and ended up being those people whose hearts did react negatively to it and now both have even further damaging heart issues due to it. I was furious with her, this health issue had nothing to do with covid or a vaccine and because of his age this was a VERY risky surgery that they said he could possibly not make out of because of his age and diabetes and instead of being a support, she diminished it with stupid politics! I have not spoken to her since and I would not fault you at all for not sending them to them.
