Keep your money, save up and move out (preferably to a different city) when you are able, otherwise they'll be expecting \"auntie\" to chip in for everything. \n\nI know the dynamic is different in Middle Eastern families being more closeknit than western families. And yes, there's a tendency to treat only sons as if they're the center of the universe (I live in a Mediterranean country and I see much the same here, sisters expected to wait hand-and-foot on brothers etc). But even by that standard, your mom is taking it too far, and yes your brother is a spoiled brat. That is 100% on your parents for not teaching him better.\n\nYou didn't give birth to your brother or his kids and you did not take them to raise. Take this as a lesson for when you have your own family one day.", "NTA. It\u2019s true. They enable him so he doesn\u2019t have to do better.
