One of my classmates Malcolm (m24) and I don't get along. He is obsessed with me and believes me to be the reason for all his problems. He makes everyone in our year uncomfortable, especially the women. He's a fine filmmaker but interacting with him can be scary since he doesn't care about consent. Without getting into details, last year Malcolm wouldn't leave me alone and would blow up my phone with concerning messages where he admitted that he has an obsession with me. When this happened, and he realized I was not going to engage in his behavior, he tried to peer pressure me into being his friend which backfired. Since he has imagined that our cohort is embroiled in some sort of civil war over what he did to me but no one else sees it that way. He has no friends and is on the spectrum so I never tried to be mean to him.  I advertised my cousin Anthony's (m20) skills to my entire cohort, making it known that we were related too. Malcolm reached out to him. Anthony knew a bit about the situation and said he would pull out anytime I wanted him to.\n\nLast week, Malcolm sent a series of messages to the cohort's group chat. He went off about me and my abhorrent behavior (me not wanting to be his friend). It was clear he was having some sort of breakdown but I was just sick of him villainizing and obsessing over me. I went off on him and took screenshots of his ramblings and sent them to Anthony. He decided to back out of Malcolm's film. They were well into production and so now Malcolm's film will be in jeopardy.\n\nMalcolm's behavior has now been put onto other people. The school is now getting involved and I had to tell my parents what has happened. They remember last year's incident where Malcolm showed his obsession so my dad has told me to show him some compassion because everyone knows what it's like to feel like no one likes you. When I told him I sent screenshots of what Malcolm said to Anthony, my dad went ballistic and said I was TA for that. Malcolm is autistic and has no friends, but all of his problems are because of who he is as a person. Being on the spectrum doesn't make you unable to understand that no means no, right?\n\nAITA for sharing screenshots of my classmate's breakdown over me?\n\nEdit: changed embroidered to embroiled. Damn autocorrect\n\nEdit 2: Can't respond to comments for some reason but my father explained that he's mostly scared about what Malcolm will do in retaliation. He brought up having no friends as he feels Malcolm is getting to the point where he has nothing to lose. He worries the school won't do anything mainly because he is autistic and he is somewhat right. When I originally spoke to the school about this, they said his behavior was abhorrent but that he might not understand and that they've never dealt with a situation where the aggressor is on the spectrum and it will be a \"learning experience for everyone.\" I don't know what they will actually do.", "created_utc": 1679263522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vzclp/aita_for_sharing_screenshots_of_my_classmates/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Save every scrap of evidence you can and keep a backup, Malcolm's behavior can possibly escalate and you want to get law enforcement on your side when it/if does.  File for a protective order if you can.  Document everything and do not engage with him.  Him being on the spectrum has nothing to do with not understanding consent.", "NTA. His diagnosis neither excuses or gives him the right to behave the way he is. You will never be T A for doing whatever necessary to keep yourself safe, even if that means publicly exposing someone\u2019s behavior. You probably should go to the police with what you have as it is. \n\n\nAlso, can I slap your dad? \u201cWe\u2019ll he has no friends\u201d and \u201che\u2019s autistic so you have to accept it\u201d is the exact mindset that leads to women getting hurt, and men not being held accountable for their actions.", "I am a teacher who deals with special education students and students on the spectrum often. I can confidently say your are NOT TA. His disability is not an excuse to make others feel vilified or UNCOMFORTABLE. If he wasn't on the spectrum this would be considered harassment but because he has a disability it is okay for him it is ok? NO! He needs to learn and be explicitly taught that this behavior is NOT ok! Yes, he might have trouble understanding social cues but he still needs to be held responsible for his behavior be it counseling verses suspension or whatever. Still accountability.\n\nHad you done it just be to mean then sure I would say you were in the wrong but from the sounds of it you had shown him a lot of grace.", "NTA.\n\nYou showed compassion and set reasonable boundaries. And you\u2018re always allowed to ensure your safety and put your own well-being and protection first.\n\nMalcolm is an adult and needs to take responsibility for his behavior. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. This bad behaviour will only escalate if it's not stopped. You're not the only one who is uncomfortable around this guy and you have receipts of his harassment. People need to stop bubble wrapping autism. There are countless autistic people who function well in society. This guy is showing that he is not capable. Enabling him is a cop out and it's doing a disservice to everyone who has to deal with him and also a disservice to Malcolm himself. This needs to be dealt with on a higher level. Your father needs to take a damn seat.", ">When I originally spoke to the school about this, they said his behavior was abhorrent but that he might not understand and that they've never dealt with a situation where the aggressor is on the spectrum and it will be a \"learning experience for everyone.\" I don't know what they will actually do.\n\nGet that in writing.", "NTA.

The film industry does not need another toxic personality that repeatedly ignores boundaries.

If they still refuse to act, tell them that you will be filing a Title IX complaint against the school and the administrators who are refusing to deal with it.\n\nAlso, you are NTA for shining a light on this stalker's behavior.

As someone who\u2019s gotten a restraining order this year  because of an angry and aggressive man you should get one. It\u2019s not your job to emotionally coach him or make this a learning experience. It\u2019s your job to stay safe. \n\nHe is a threatening person and is losing his shit because he\u2019s fixated on you. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not he has a disability, he is causing harm. I wouldn\u2019t get a pass on stalking and trying to infiltrate someone\u2019s life (who is scared of me and told me to back off) because I\u2019m angry and don\u2019t like it- just because I have a learning disability. \n\nBeing ND isn\u2019t a free pass to committing crimes and terrorizing others!\n\nThis has been a habitual thing it seems, it\u2019s not a one-off event. He has a fixation and obsession with you. That\u2019s serious. \n\nIt\u2019s NOT your job to take care of him or deal with him not having friends. Maybe he\u2019d have more friends if he didn\u2019t terrorize random women!!! \n\nGet a restraining order, let the school do what it may. His behaviors will only escalate if he\u2019s not hit with a wave of accountability. Also, stalking is illegal. His continued attempts to reach you (and the unhinged things he says) along with him pursuing people who know you to get in touch with you should qualify as stalking. \n\nYou have a right to protect your own mental and physical well-being.\n\nYou should NOT be expected to be an unwilling Guinea pig for some improvised stalker-treatment program your school is facilitating. Especially when that requires you to put yourself at risk!! That\u2019s absurd.\n\nYou\u2019re not his psych team, his family, his doctor, or the disability office. You are there for your education!!! He is a threat to you and that\u2019s all there is to it. \n\nIt\u2019s a pattern of behavior, not some social flub or misunderstanding. Repel the idea that you are obligated to coddle someone who\u2019s targeting you and causing you emotional distress!!!\n\nThink about how he will do this to others as his life continues, because he will. You have a chance to both protect yourself and protect others he may target in the future. It may be scary, and yes- there\u2019s the possibility of him lashing out- but he needs to hear from the law that this is not okay. \n\nAnd frankly it should become HIS problem to deal with, not yours. His problem and the school\u2019s. The restraining order would put the onus on them. Let the school know when you\u2019ve received a restraining order and when it will get served. Say you expect your safety to be protected and expect the school\u2019s support while you are being chronically stalked. \n\nIf the school wants to do some intervention to help him with autism or whatever, that\u2019s on them. Not your problem, not your fucking job! \n\nSorry this is happening to you. Feel free to message me if I can offer more support or info about the steps I had to take. \n\nEdit: I forgot to finish a sentence and forgot to put NTA at the beginning.", "NTA you've been dealing with stalking and harassment for over a year now.
