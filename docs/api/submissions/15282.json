However, I've been purposely avoiding socializing with them, and I only talk to them if it's related to work.\n\nThe reason for my behavior is because I was previously accused of harassment at my old job for being too friendly with my female coworkers. This was frustrating for me because I never intended to come across as creepy, but the situation turned toxic, and I had to leave.\n\nSo, to avoid a similar situation, I've been intentionally keeping my distance from my female coworkers. I don't initiate conversations, hang out with them after work, or attend work parties.\n\nHowever, the owner of the store called me into his office and said that my behavior was disrespectful and sexist. He wanted me to apologize and be more friendly because we were like a \"family.\" I refused to apologize because I don't believe I did anything wrong.\n\nA few days later, a few of my coworkers approached me during my break to try and chat, but I tried to brush them off and told them that I didn't want to be disturbed. They got upset and called me rude and anti-social, accusing me of being sexist for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1682009780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t7skh/aita_for_avoiding_interactions_with_my_female/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Say look I tried to have friendships in the past with coworkers and I got in trouble for it so just trying to be a little cautious.", "Op is keeping the conversations to work related subjects, at work.  And it doesn't sound like there are that many male members of staff to 'interact just fine with'.", "I missed that one omg, do you have a link?", "Chances are you're completely making that up.", "[removed]", "There\u2019s being a creep/offending someone, and there\u2019s doing it to such a degree that someone goes to HR over it. \n\nDespite what Reddit says, no one *wants* to lodge a complaint.

He hasn't told us. It's possible that he was accused of harassment because he was harassing people. It's possible he's the victim of someone else's lies. We don't know.\n\nI think that the fact that he won't tell us why he was accused of harassment is pretty damning. If he was unfairly accused, I think he would have told us.\n\nIf you are accused of harassment because you harassed someone, you aren't a victim.\n\nIt's also pretty damning that OP thinks the solution to his problem is to ignore all of the women he works with. That points to low emotional intelligence on his part, which makes it more likely that he actually harassed someone.", "I know enough people at work who'd complain about you over bugger all.

I had to change careers because of it. And yet it still would be completely inappropriate for me to avoid talking to all of the men I work with on the off chance that they might try to grope me, just because I've had that happen to me before. It's my responsibility to deal with my trauma in a way that lets me treat others with dignity and respect, just the way I'd want to be treated.\n\nHonestly? Anyone who whines about having to avoid interaction with others so they don't get accused of harassment seems super sus.
