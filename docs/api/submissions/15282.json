However, I've been purposely avoiding socializing with them, and I only talk to them if it's related to work.\n\nThe reason for my behavior is because I was previously accused of harassment at my old job for being too friendly with my female coworkers. This was frustrating for me because I never intended to come across as creepy, but the situation turned toxic, and I had to leave.\n\nSo, to avoid a similar situation, I've been intentionally keeping my distance from my female coworkers. I don't initiate conversations, hang out with them after work, or attend work parties.\n\nHowever, the owner of the store called me into his office and said that my behavior was disrespectful and sexist. He wanted me to apologize and be more friendly because we were like a \"family.\" I refused to apologize because I don't believe I did anything wrong.\n\nA few days later, a few of my coworkers approached me during my break to try and chat, but I tried to brush them off and told them that I didn't want to be disturbed. They got upset and called me rude and anti-social, accusing me of being sexist for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1682009780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t7skh/aita_for_avoiding_interactions_with_my_female/", "score": 638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you treat women like people and not specifically like *women,* you're very unlikely to have any issues with sexual harrassment accusations. I do see the difficulty if you're on the older side (like me) in that behaviors that used to be accepted are not anymore. But those behaviors were never ok. They made us uncomfortable. It's not unreasonable to expect a man to be able to be cordial and professional and refrain from overly personal comments at work. You just have to internalize that women are *people.* We aren't just our bodies and we aren't interested in your opinions on them at work. Is that *really* so hard?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I don't care in the slightest if you avoid your female coworkers as long as it doesn't interfere with their jobs and opportunities to advance. But I do think you need to *relax.* Women aren't out to get you. Why would we be? A man who *doesn't* harrass women is usually nice to work with. It's seriously evil to try to harm someone's career for no reason. Why would women do that?"]}
