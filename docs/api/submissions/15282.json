However, I've been purposely avoiding socializing with them, and I only talk to them if it's related to work.\n\nThe reason for my behavior is because I was previously accused of harassment at my old job for being too friendly with my female coworkers. This was frustrating for me because I never intended to come across as creepy, but the situation turned toxic, and I had to leave.\n\nSo, to avoid a similar situation, I've been intentionally keeping my distance from my female coworkers. I don't initiate conversations, hang out with them after work, or attend work parties.\n\nHowever, the owner of the store called me into his office and said that my behavior was disrespectful and sexist. He wanted me to apologize and be more friendly because we were like a \"family.\" I refused to apologize because I don't believe I did anything wrong.\n\nA few days later, a few of my coworkers approached me during my break to try and chat, but I tried to brush them off and told them that I didn't want to be disturbed. They got upset and called me rude and anti-social, accusing me of being sexist for no reason.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1682009780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t7skh/aita_for_avoiding_interactions_with_my_female/", "score": 1035, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
