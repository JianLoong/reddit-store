Your first duty is towards your children. Do not raise your children around an alcoholic if you can at all help it! Your grandfather is partially right that your mother did this to herself. Neither medically nor psycologically is the truth quite so simple, but your mother probably will have episodes, will be wanting to drink during the period between now and when she passes. You should not be subjecting your young family to any of this. It is tragic enough as it is. You and your sister should be helping each other against undue pressure from other members of the family.", "NTA\n\nTl/Dr: I've been there, don't let her move in with you \n\n(I'm genuinely not trying to make your post about me, but I'm going to quickly explain my background.)\n\nMy dad died in 2015, at 64. Technically it was esophageal cancer, but he was already dying from a lifetime of alcohol abuse and alcohol induced dementia. In the grand scheme, it wasn't a hugely long decline, but it felt like a millennium. Oh, he was also schizophrenic, although pretty stable. I've been someplace very similar to where you are.\n\n*DO NOT MOVE HER IN WITH YOU* In fact, I would strongly, strongly urge you not to allow her to move in with any family. But you will soon have a newborn and I would not risk endangering your baby by bringing your mom to your house. My dad nearly burned his house down several times. He nearly killed himself *and* burned the house down when he passed out on the wood burning stove. People with dementia deserve love and care, but they can be dangerous to themselves and others. Please, don't allow your grandmother to guilt you into this. As for your cousins, they're welcome to house your mom if that seems like a good idea to them. \n\nIf she is still drinking *at all*, the decline you see will likely be rapid, and sharp. Even if she's completely stopped drinking, in my experience, there's not great news on the dementia disappearing. My dad stopped drinking in the last few months and I saw no sign it was reducing the dementia. Almost the opposite. Maybe your mom will be more lucky, but it's risky to trust that. \n\nBecause of this, she will require 24/7 care sooner than you may think. And that is super hard and expensive to arrange. You'd need at least 2 caretakers, coverage for weekends, coverage for their vacations, etc. And, you're paying someone's entire paycheck -  at least $35-45,000/year. And that's just one full time person! It may seem reasonable to stay home with the baby and your mom, but I expect it would be a nightmare. My dad (like many) would get an idea and then take off outside the house. The only reason his caretakers allowed him to drink is because otherwise he'd sneak down to the pawn shop and then go buy liquor. Actually, he still managed that because he knew we were giving him less than he used to drink. He was incredibly wiley. \n\nI would talk with her guardian about finding someplace safe for your mom to live long-term. If she's living somewhere with other people then all of their payments can go towards that salary. You might even be able to find someone who cares for people in their home who could care for her at this early stage. She gets to be in a family environment, with people who understand the ins and outs of this.\n\nAlso, make sure you get financial and medical POA. Unless the guardian automatically controls those, you'll need them (I was on my way to court to get guardianship when my dad died so I'm not so familiar with that). You especially need them if she's ever out in public. There are people out there who look for people like your mom to take advantage of. \n\nFinally, make sure you get to say anything you need to say and at least try to hear what you need to hear, before she's gone. Before I lost my dad I didn't really understand how destabilizing it can be to lose a parent, even as a grown adult. I wish I'd been able to write down more about him as a person, less of him as my parent. I try to suggest that to others now. \n\nI'm glad your wedding was so smooth and happy. Congratulations on your pregnancy, I hope it's smooth, healthy, and easy the whole way.\n\nIf you ever need to vent or have a question feel free to DM me. Alcoholic parents are hard enough. Adding in dementia just makes it a million times more difficult. Good luck <3", "Hey here\u2019s a tip:  you ARE caring for your mother.  Maybe not in the way your grandma wants but in the way that is best for your mom.  NTA", "I'm currently in training to become a Guardian and I've worked for a guardianship agency for over a year. I see cases like yours all the time. You've done nothing wrong, Guardians are not the government, and in all honesty this is probably the best thing that can happen because when it comes to people with serious addictions, family can sometimes do more harm than good. Case in point, your grandma. I guarantee you if your grandmother were to care for your mom, she'd likely enable a lot of your mom's behavior and make the situation worse. \n\nGuardians are legally obligated to follow the wishes of the patient as best as they can and have a professional ethical obligation to make family available when it is safe to do so (sometimes family is not safe and they must be kept away to protect the client). If your mom's dementia gets to the point she can't speak for herself then you can help fill in the blanks and the guardian will be really appreciative of that. \n\nDespite everything your mother put you through, you still showed up for her in her time of need. You're making sure she has the best  care that can be provided and that there are people who will look after her best interests.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Absolutely do not let her live with you. And could she even live with you as she has a guardian?", "NTA. You are way over your head if you try to care for her.", "NTA\n\nNeither you, nor any other family member you describe, is able to give your mother the kind of full-time care she needs.  Your mother should stay in a care facility that is staffed with people who are trained in caregiving. \n\nEncourage your family members to visit your mother as often as they are able, and to help support her with cards, other communication, and modest gifts (often, clothes go missing in care facilities, so low cost comfortable clothes are good gifts).", "Dear cousins,  thankyou for your concern.  When shall I tell Mother she is moving in with you?", "NTA. All these family members coming out of the woodwork to insert their opinions can put their hands up to look after her. Your priority needs to be on your immediate family, which is your partner and child", "Nta no she needs more care than is possible in any of your homes.\n\nTake a minute to have some sympathy for your grandma though, this is her daughter- her baby. Who is very sick and is likely dying and she just wants to take care of her and be with her. (as long as its healthy for mom and grandma) look into more ways grandma can see mom, so she isnt reliant on the uncles to take her. Hospital carpool, church group volunteers, community volunteers, taxis,  the cousins who think family takes care of family, see what resources social services can signpost, set up a regular rota (maybe 1 person drops her off and someone else picks her up),\n\nWith the visiting rota, set it up for long term sustainability. Grandma is old and needs her own rest maybe 2/3 visits a week for a few hours (not a whole day). Also set up a rota for other family members to visit regularly. Perhaps then grandma won't feel she needs to be there all the time because someone else is looking after her. Would facetime calls be possible? (Perhaps only if you know grandma won't put too much of a burden on the staff to do this)", "Tell them fine they can take care of her since they're also her family. Don't let these people stress you out further when you've already got a lot on your plate and pregnant to boot. Let people who are experienced take care of your mom but keep an eye on them.

If there is a way to keep a person with family the guardian will make every effort to make it happen. A good guardian adapts to the specific needs and circumstances of their client. \n\nA very common situation is that family may not have been aware of how bad things got, the person is temporarily placed in a guardianship as the person is not capable of communicating they have family. Family will step in once made aware and have the person come live with them or put them in a facility close to their locale. \n\nOne situation I'm intimately involved with (and is also very common): the siblings could not stop fighting over what was best for their clearly declining parent. This person wanted to live with one child but the other kids were convinced that this person was being coerced by the child they wanted to live with. The decision to live with this child stood, but the guardian remained involved so that way, they could oversee care and manage the finances. That way, everything remained above board to prevent war breaking out over the estate and to prioritize mom's money and to provide full accounting for mom's care.\n\nIn this situation, no immediate family is able (or allowed) to step in. Mom needs a lot of care, so the guardian is taking a load off the family, and is professionally obligated to get mom the best care her budget allows."]}
