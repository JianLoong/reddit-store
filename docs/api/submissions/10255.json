That child has their own life to live...not be the next life of their parents!", "NTA, and not all heroes wear capes. He *cheated on you* but still expected you to name your child after him? To be a daily reminder in your life of the man who hurt you and broke his vows to you??? You had every right and reason to commemorate your beloved father instead. Love your beautiful son and cherish him.\n\nETA: I feel like a lot of people aren't getting that his whole \"I want my affair partner to have an active role in his early childhood\" is a request for OP to have to interact closely and meaningfully with that woman, because right now the baby *is a newborn* who can't be away from his mama for more than a few minutes at a time. \"Taking an active role in his life\" means, right now, taking an active role in *OP's* life and personal space after several very traumatic events have occurred in quick succession (affair, divorce, childbirth). \n\nSo her ex is basically saying that not only does he want to come over to spend time with little Dave, but he wants to bring into her life and her home *the woman who wrecked their marriage*. And, oh yeah, the ex was also sexually abusive for pressuring/blaming her for not having sex whilst heavily pregnant. OP has every reason to not get into an argument with this man and instead just quietly NOT name her baby after the guy who inflicted (and wishes to continue to inflict) trauma on her.", "NTA. Why would you want your son to be named after your cheating ex, and later when he finds out what happened I doubt he\u2019d to thrilled either, and naming a kid after a parent is just narcissist behaviour anyway and a lack of imagination.", "I can sort of see the point of the all E-S-H votes. \nBut like no, fuck that. NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s completely ridiculous for him to expect you to still use that name. And it\u2019s even more ridiculous for him to get a tattoo of an expected delivery date before the kid is born. A lot of circumstances could have caused that to change even if you hadn\u2019t rescheduled it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with your ex husband turning into a baby when you should be celebrating the birth of your actual baby. I hope your able to focus on what\u2019s actually important right now.", "NTA and I\u2019ll take the downvotes happily.

This dude cheated on you, blamed you for being pregnant, wants his affair partner to be active in raising the baby and wants to name it. Yeah F-all that noise. I wouldn\u2019t even give the baby his last name. \n\nI would breast feed and not pump, only cloth diaper, and anything else I could do to keep him away. He is the worst sort of human. \n\nPut him on child support immediately.

If you\u2019re going to name a child after someone, it has to be someone you want to honor and someone you genuinely respect. What has your ex done that\u2019s worth honoring?

No. But you were also pregnant and dealing with a high stress situation so I can understand the desire to reduce the amount of stress you\u2019re under. \n\nIn regards to changing the date of delivery: still NTA. If you no longer wanted him there as support then it would be the logical move. Having to deal with him trying to demand entry to the delivery room because he knew the delivery date (and it sounds like he\u2019s entitled enough to do just that) is not something you should have to deal with. \n\nAs for his demands regarding his gf: supervised visits with only him until you have a custody arrangement and get a lawyer.
