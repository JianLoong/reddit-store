But this is the conversation that you have with your spouse before you have children. When the parents share different beliefs, it is important to have a clear plan on how you will raise your children and what you will teach them and when.

Seems like each of your viewpoint is very important to both of you so I'm baffled that you never thought it would be a problem once you had children. \n\nNot sure I can confidently say YTA when the kids asked you a question and you responded to the best of your ability but I can see why your husband is upset that he feels that his own view has been discredited to the eyes of your children.", "NTA. Security and peace in being religious should not rely on ignorance.", "This is tough. If the husband had a good grasp on his faith and evolution he would see it as a good opportunity for discussion and learning, as the two are not mutually exclusive. There is certainly room to believe that God created the process of evolution, depending on how you read and interpret scripture. \n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re in a religiously oppressive place and talking about evolution is dangerous, then you may have placed their lives in jeopardy unless you were super, super clear they can\u2019t talk about this AND you know your kid well enough to know they won\u2019t talk about it.

Maybe you can say ESH \n\nI'm an atheist and would be adamant about teaching my children about evolution. My issue is that you are having this conversation now, not 6 years ago.\n\nThis is a pretty big thing when raising kids. You need to have clear conversations about how you will raise your kids BEFORE you have kids. \n\nIt's important to show your children a united front. Even if it's to say that 'mom believes x' and 'dad believes y' and sometimes people disagree. It could have been a great point to discuss autonomy and respect for others beliefs. Instead you presented this as THE answer.", "My husband does accept evolution as a fact. We're both doctors and denying evolution is not even an option.

Kudos to her for not teaching them a fairy tale...", "His logic is very insulting to his religion. It sounds like he's saying.\"if the kids are educated in facts and science, they are less likely to follow religion.\"\n\nI mean, it's true, but you don't often see people just come out and say it.", "NTA - his belief system is pretty shaky if teaching the kids things that he himself believes will make them atheists", "It apparently doesn't stop him from believing, so why would it stop them?", "Well if he accepts it, what makes him think that the kids can't be religious and accept evolution at the same time?", "NTA OP. Your spouse needs to assess his world-view. \n\nOne the one hand, he puts exorbitant value on \"religious\" experience and wants very badly for his children to have full access/ability to live a religious life. \n\nOn the other hand, he believes that learning scientific facts (which he concedes as being facts) will undermine his children's capacity to accept religion in the future. He thinks that science must be learned on a foundation of faith first, or else the faith will never have a chance to fully grab hold and dominate their thought process.\n\nConclusion: Your husband prefers that children with impressionable minds be indoctrined into religion AND be sheltered from science because he believes that is the best path to get them to value faith over facts. Also your husband does not have enough FAITH in FAITH to trust that it can win their hearts on its merits alone. Thus he insists on cheating by making religion the only message. \n\nThat says a WHOLE LOT about what he really believes when it comes to religion. That it is the preferred outcome even though it is weak and inferior to science. He should ask himself why does he feel this way?", "Scientific theories are defined as such because they a) are backed by numerous testable/verifiable facts, not just one and b) have withstood testing designed to disprove them.\n\n\nTo put it another way, in science a theory is stronger than a mere fact.", "Technically gravity is a theory.", "\"Theory\" has a specific meaning in science.\n\nWhen scientists talk about \"the theory of evolution\" what they mean is \"this is, to the best of our knowledge and observed reality, what happens\"", "Exactly, it\u2019s only 99.7% falsifiable so it\u2019s important to kowtow to every single preposterous mystical mythology with zero supporting evidentiary record to make things fair.", "That\u2019s true.

And why does this bother you so much?", "What's so bad about evolution? The child asked, the parent answered.

It does not mean \"Tested and proven concept\" to laymen. \n\nSo while you may actually agree it's proven sound your phrasing is 100% indicative of a religious fundamentalist, which is why people keep correcting you.", "Oh you mean like Darwin\u2019s Law of Evolution by Natural Selection? Scientifically confirmed through observation and experiments? It is a fact, whether you believe it or not.", "Hmmmm. Nope.\nThere was a tendency in the past to call things laws when they were discovered.  This was a mistake, and what are commonly called laws in physics are taught to 8 th graders as theories.   A common mistake in nomenclature. \n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laws-of-nature/#:~:text=Science%20includes%20many%20principles%20at,and%20demand%2C%20and%20so%20on.", "Evolutionary Theory as a means of understanding deep history is a theory only because of the fragments of info lost to time. Evolution as an observable process over the course of recent years and decades is fact.", "It is a fact. Theory in a scientific sense is not the same as you might use in a casual sense, where it implies that it's merely a guess. In scientific terms, thats more in line with a hypothesis\n\nWe call it Quantum Theory or the Theory of Relativity for instance, but we know with certainty that gravity and particles exist. \n\nEvolution is a fact, well established and proven far beyond any reasonable doubt", "Evolution is both a fact and a theory. \n\nThe fact is that gene pools change over time, especially when isolated from other similar gene pools, resulting in changes in species. We know this happens - we can literally observe it happening in species with very short generation times, and in the fossil record, and in the relationships between modern species measured in DNA similarities and morphological comparisons, and in the geographic distribution of species compared to those physical relationships.\n\nThe theory is the explanation of how this happens, and the best available theory, tested over hundreds of years in every possible way and passing every test with flying colors, is Darwin's theory of natural selection (somewhat altered and adjusted for subsequent new discoveries, like genes and chromosomes, but almost entirely the same mechanism as described by Charles Darwin in the mid-1800s).\n\nThe fact is like the Egyptian pyramids. We know they're there, we know what they're made of and what they look like inside and out. The theory is the explanation of how and why they were built, found in pharaonic pronouncements, workmen's records, tomb paintings, the sarcophagi and mummies themselves along with their grave goods, and even graffiti sketched on rock sherds. The theory is not quite as certain as the solid stone fact of their existence, but it is pretty solid nonetheless. Some people try to claim still that they needed ancient alien help and that no society at the Egyptians' level could have achieved such things- but we have found literal descriptions by people who were there of how it was done, who did it, and how much beer and bread each person who helped build them was paid to do it, and for that matter what excuses they used to get days off (everything from \"needed to brew beer\" to \"stung by scorpion\" to \"wife gave birth\").", "There are vanishingly few facts in science, so this a strawman argument.", "Actually I apologize I responded incorrectly. I thought I read your name next to the post you responded to.", "Ok grammar police it isn\u2019t English class I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s weird telling toddlers THAT ARE 6 AND 5 about evolution.", "Simple, it doesn\u2019t ever come from anywhere.", "Ah, no worries.", "It's really not.
