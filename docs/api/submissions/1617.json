It's a very fancy one and everyone saved up enough money to afford their share. The resort has a night club inside and we were really excited to go to but knew we couldn't. The thing is Khadijah (whom we call Dhijah) is Muslim and she doesn't like going to clubs or be around alcohol, it's because of her religion and we all respect that. We never drink any alcohol around her or even make or mention any plans that she will not be able to attend.\n\nWell to our surprise, Dhijah said that it was fine for us to go to the club, we didn't want to as she would be left out but she said she doesn't mind coming with us. We told her that so many people will be drinking and even we will because it's a night club and we don't want to her to feel pressurized to do things out of her comfort zone just to fit in. She said it was fine and dragged us with her to the club.\n\nWell we didn't mind. Me and my friends excluding Dhijah tried to keep the alcohol on the low and got no more than 2 shots, but we all stayed together so Dhijah came kinda close when we drank. Dhijah looked at us weirdly when she saw us drink and stormed out. We thought she was probably tired but one of my other friends Elena suggested we go after her.\n\nAnd so we did, when we stepped out of the club we saw Dhijah walking away about to take the path to the rooms (our rooms were pretty far). We called out to her so many times but each time she would just walk faster, it's not like she didn't hear us because we were screaming pretty loudly. \n\nIt came to the point that Elena had to run to Khadijah, she managed to stop her and we all caught up with them. At this point Dhijah was fuming. We asked her if something was wrong and why she was avoiding us and she said because what we did was haram. We looked to each other and asked her what happened. \n\nShe basically said that we disrespected her by drinking in front of her and that we were just huge brats. I then went on to tell her that we did warn her we would be drinking and she went to a club, what did she expect and that we also drank very less because of her and that she even said it was fine. \n\nShe said that she didn't actually think we would drink and that we were disgusting for disrespecting her and her religion. That isn't true, we have so much respect for both her and her religion, we didn't want to upset her. \n\nThe next day aka yesterday went super bad, we woke up had breakfast, lunch, packed our bags and checked out and yet no one said a word though Khadijah gave us some looks. \n\nWe never meant to disrespect or upset her.

It's her religion, the only person who should be following it is her. It's rude to impose one's religion onto another. I myself am Hindu so I don't eat beef but that doesn't mean I stop all my friends from eating it and drop people for eating beef. It's my religion only I have to follow said practice. Also wtf did she expect when going to a pub? It's literally a place meant for drinking? Drop her, religious nuts who try to force their religion onto others are not worth the trouble.", "NTA.

You invited her to an activity, where haram was an option, and you didn't pressure her to participate in the drinking, even though the activity as a whole was haram\n\nThe word \"respect\" can loosely mean varying degrees,  following, accepting, accommodating, tolerating\n\nShe thought you would more following her practices and your plan was more at the accommodating level.\n\n\"We never drink alcohol around her or mention any plans that she will not be able to attend.\" Your prior behavior led Khadijah to think that you wouldn't be drinking. She is not TA\n\nYou thought that clubs and drinking go together and that she was cool with that. You are not TA.\n\nNAH, but clarity would be needed for the next time.", "Info: is Khadija newly converted?", "Very well put!\n\nJust a small fun fact, apparently in the long gone past it was only haram if Muslims drank alcohol or where intoxicated at the Mosque.\nOver the centuries it evolved to the stricter ruler which is now in place.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. I am an older lady who has had the pleasure of participating in many different religious ceremonies as I have friends from many different faiths. Mutual respect is key.", "NTA AT ALL. I have Muslim friends and family and would never drink around them. BUT if they also wouldn't go to clubs or bars etc. Dijah had some nerve insisting on going to a club and THEN being all angry because you drank, though you had already told her you would! I'd re-think my friendship if I were you. Shes not asking you to respect her religion, she's IMPOSING it on you. AND why be friends with someone who thinks you are \"huge brats\" and \"disgusting\" and \"disrespectful?\"", "They told her that they would be drinking, tho? It's mentioned in the post that she was warned people, including them, would be drinking. \n\nCommunication did happen", "But OP didn't invite her to the activity, OPs friend insisted that they all go to the club and OP & the rest were up front that they planned to drink and have fun.\n\n\nThe friend put herself into that situation entirely herself, and what more should OP do? Her friends religion isn't hers and she shouldn't have to curb her actions for the sake of her friends religion even more so because there will be situations to where the friend has zero control like work or social functions that they are invited to.", "The onus is on her to manage her behavior, not her friends. I was always taught that we as Muslims have to take responsibility for our actions and if our environment won\u2019t allow us to behave in an Islamic manner, it\u2019s our responsibility to move ourselves.\n\nETA: I\u2019m not even particularly religious, maybe spiritual at most, but I remember that much. When you go to judgment day, it\u2019s your own actions and words and intentions that will be judged.", "No. You are responsible for your own experience. You control your own body. Not anyone else. This woman's friend is 100% the asshole - she was *told* they would be drinking. So she came along anyway after the warning and still thought she could impose her religious autocracy on them. \n\nAnyone who expects other people to conform to their religious requirements is the asshole full stop."]}
