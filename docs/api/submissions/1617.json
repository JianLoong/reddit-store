It's a very fancy one and everyone saved up enough money to afford their share. The resort has a night club inside and we were really excited to go to but knew we couldn't. The thing is Khadijah (whom we call Dhijah) is Muslim and she doesn't like going to clubs or be around alcohol, it's because of her religion and we all respect that. We never drink any alcohol around her or even make or mention any plans that she will not be able to attend.\n\nWell to our surprise, Dhijah said that it was fine for us to go to the club, we didn't want to as she would be left out but she said she doesn't mind coming with us. We told her that so many people will be drinking and even we will because it's a night club and we don't want to her to feel pressurized to do things out of her comfort zone just to fit in. She said it was fine and dragged us with her to the club.\n\nWell we didn't mind. Me and my friends excluding Dhijah tried to keep the alcohol on the low and got no more than 2 shots, but we all stayed together so Dhijah came kinda close when we drank. Dhijah looked at us weirdly when she saw us drink and stormed out. We thought she was probably tired but one of my other friends Elena suggested we go after her.\n\nAnd so we did, when we stepped out of the club we saw Dhijah walking away about to take the path to the rooms (our rooms were pretty far). We called out to her so many times but each time she would just walk faster, it's not like she didn't hear us because we were screaming pretty loudly. \n\nIt came to the point that Elena had to run to Khadijah, she managed to stop her and we all caught up with them. At this point Dhijah was fuming. We asked her if something was wrong and why she was avoiding us and she said because what we did was haram. We looked to each other and asked her what happened. \n\nShe basically said that we disrespected her by drinking in front of her and that we were just huge brats. I then went on to tell her that we did warn her we would be drinking and she went to a club, what did she expect and that we also drank very less because of her and that she even said it was fine. \n\nShe said that she didn't actually think we would drink and that we were disgusting for disrespecting her and her religion. That isn't true, we have so much respect for both her and her religion, we didn't want to upset her. \n\nThe next day aka yesterday went super bad, we woke up had breakfast, lunch, packed our bags and checked out and yet no one said a word though Khadijah gave us some looks. \n\nWe never meant to disrespect or upset her.

Also wtf did she expect when going to a pub? It's literally a place meant for drinking? Drop her, religious nuts who try to force their religion onto others are not worth the trouble.", "NTA.

Religion is just the excuse masking your friend's controlling and judgemental attitude. You've been accommodating her all this time and she seems to take that for granted. She owes you all an apology. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She basically set you all up to fail her little \"friendship\" test. She'll do this again in the future and you'll all fail again. She isn't a good friend and you all should just stop hanging out.", "NTA let me tell you something: Muslims are allowed to drink under some circumstances. Lula Da Silva used to drink with Muslim leaders", "NTA. She chose to join you in a situation where it alcohol would be served.  The issue is hers, not yours. She was the AH to accompany you and expect you to follow her rules.", "NTA. Your friend is though for trying to force her religion on everyone else. Not to mention she said it was ok. If she didn\u2019t mean it she should t have said she was. She also shouldn\u2019t have gone on the vacation in the first place, she ruined it for everyone and wasted your money. \n\nMy best friend is sober, and has been for years now as she struggled with her bipolar disorder when she drank. She doesn\u2019t care if others drink, as long as you don\u2019t try and force her to. If we go out to eat I\u2019ll ask if she\u2019s okay with me having a drink to be respectful but if we went to a club it\u2019s pretty much implied.", "NTA\n\nI love that you did ask and made sure that she was okay with things. I also do love that she was not being ignored and was noticed when she left. \n\nShe\u2019s got her own thing going on, and it\u2019s her choice to cut contact with you guys. However I feel that it would be mistake on her end, because you guys do sound like considerate friends. \n\nBut you\u2019re NTA", "NTA. Respecting a religious belief isn\u2019t the same as having to follow it. Not your religion, you don\u2019t have to live by those rules. \n\nTrying to force you to follow her beliefs is ridiculous.", "I\u2019m calling bs on this.. the behaviour doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. No muslim who was that set against alcohol would ever set foot in a club to begin with", "NTA.\n\nI have friends who do not drink for religious reasons and they have never imposed that onto anyone else. It's honestly going above and beyond that the friend group modifies your behavior this much around her.\n\nEnvironments that are centered around alcohol are not for everyone. I hope she grows to realize it's fine to skip one group activity if it doesn't suit her. (Just as one might skip the group skydiving trip, if that's not something they want to do.) Going on vacation together doesn't mean everyone has to do every activity or nobody can enjoy it.\n\nAnd I truly hope she realizes that her religious beliefs are her own, and she cannot impose them on her friends who do not subscribe to the same set of beliefs.", "NTA\n\nPeople\u2019s religious beliefs do not extend beyond their own choices and their own bodies. She can\u2019t tell other people what to do or not do based on her religion.", "As a Muslim, she's TA. \nWhat you guys did was extremely respectful. You have the right to go club and drink. The fact that you're wary about leaving her out too is a big deal. I have so many friends who drink, I've attended parties as well where people drank (where I was obviously sober). Yes, it's a bit uncomfortable but that's not my place to dictate what they do. I chose to put myself in that situation and I should put up with it. \n\nWhat she did was insensitive and a slight break of trust. Even if she didn't expect herself to be upset by it, she had no right to take it out on you for doing so when you even warned her. She went back on her word. If she was uncomfortable, she could have just excused herself and gently let you know that she realized she wasn't alright with it but that's not your fault.", "NTA, you're not Muslim, it's not haram. Her not drinking because of her religion has nothing to do with you, she's being an asshole. One of my best friends is Muslim and she would never get mad over such a thing because it affects her in no way, and I'm not Muslim, so I have no restrictions regarding that.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing haram here was khadija going to the club. Non muslims are not obligated to practice Islamic law. That's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nI m a vegetarian,  and also don't drink .....nothing religious  but my choice but when outdoor I eat with my friends having meat on d same table.

She can follow whatever religious rules she pleases but it\u2019s not other peoples business to also follow them for her benefit.

She is punishing you all for her choice to join you in a vacation that goes against her rigid lifestyle and beliefs. She is the asshole for trying to impose her ideology onto you. You did absolutely nothing wrong. She is the asshole that owes you all in apology for going to the nightclub, lying about being ok with you all drinking in front of her and then lashing out at all of you because she could not handle seeing you all drink. She\u2019s a judgemental controlling asshole that should not go on vacations with people who don\u2019t have the same lifestyle and beliefs as she does. She is far too immature and intolerant.

Speaking as a Muslim, obviously my opinion might differ from another Muslims.\n\n>We never drink any alcohol around her or even make or mention any plans that she will not be able to attend.\n\nI can see from what was said that you and your friends are very respectful of Khadijah and Islam. Khadijah is fortunate to have considerate friends like you. You did more than enough by giving her a warning of what was to come.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems Khadijah needs to be reminded that she is responsible for her own actions and that was given more than a fair number of warnings. Even if she wasn't given a warning, she is an adult and can use intellect and reasoning to know that it is not the right place for her to be given her religious views and practices.", "NTA. Respecting her religion doesn't mean you have to follow it yourself. She's been controlling all of you and this was some kind of head game on her part. She's the one that needs to re-evaluate her behavior, not you, and maybe you shouldn't hang around her until she straightens herself out.", "NTA. It's her problem, not yours. You have to respect her choice to not drink and she has to respect your choice to drink. If anyone's being a childish brat it's her.", "NTA just stay away from religious idiots", "NTA.\n\nWhat strikes me (beyond what many others mention) is that even if your group didn't drink, ***everyone else*** at the club was. Dhijah was surrounded by drinking, and knew she would be.\n\nHer whole intention in coming was to freak out at you guys.", "Drop her as a friend. NTA", "NTA but your friend needs to get over herself.", "NTA, you are not Muslim and can drink if you want. Her rules do not apply to others unless they follow the same beliefs, they only apply to her.", "Nta, your friends religion and boundaries set by religion are for them too follow. Not you.

She has no right trying to enforce her beliefs onto you", "NTA. Get far away from that girl. She wants to force her religion onto you?

She told you to go to the club, she told you it was OK for you to drink. She is TA for getting mad at you for doing something she told you was OK. Its as if she was \"testing\" you which I always think is a ridiculous and completely manipulative", "NTA. religious freedom ends as soon as you need someone else to change to suit you.\n\ni think you could do with not been as strict around her so she doesnt think the average person cares about chaning their actions based on other peoples religion. feels a bit like a coddled reaction", "I'm going to be generous here:\nMaybe your friend wasn't testing you, she legitimately thought she would be okay with the club and you and your friends drinking.  But then she gets there and you are all drinking.  She feels excluded and gets upset.  \nIt happens.  We can all over estimate our comfort with certain things.\nSo I don't think she was the AH there.\nIf she said \"hey, this just isn't my scene and I'm going to head back to the room\" it would have been a N A H. She tried it, she didn't like it, she left.\nBUT, she said nothing before ahe stormed out, ran away from her friends, and then yelled at them and called them names.  That makes her an AH.\nYou are NTA.\n\nShe needs to learn to use her big girl words and express her discomfort with out blowing up at people.", "NTA \n\nYou have been a bit of an AH to yourself for allowing this girl and her religion to have you walking on eggshells though. There is a difference between respecting another\u2019s  religion and handing over the reigns completely to the said religious person.", "NTA - She's forcing her religion on you and that isn't fair. In my old job, my manager was a Muslim; we had a Christmas party where people drank in front of her and she wasn't bothered by it at all.", "NTA. Freedom applies to both - she's free to practice her religion, free to not drink and you're free to not practice her religion and free to drink.", "nta  screw her.  you get to have your beliefs but you don't get to impose them on others.  If I was your friend and I said my religion required you to do something stupid, would you do it or would you say \"this is my life, you do you, I'll do me.\"   Stuck up religious people don't own the universe, they don't get to control everything, they arent such special snowflakes that the world revolves around them,", "NTA. \n\nShe said to go to the club and that she was okay with people drinking around her, so you shouldn't be an exception.

And yet, your \"friend\" is not only trying to push her own choices and beliefs on the lot of you, she's even playing mind games with you about it. Which makes her TA, no questions asked.\n\nA reasonable compromise for the situation at hand would be that you can drink alcohol in her presence (within reason - just don't get shitfaced!) - but that you do not ask her to drink any, much less pressure her into it.", "Why are you even friends with her? It was in NO WAY disrespectful to her for you to drink. Her religious rules ONLY APPLY TO HER. Does she make yall cover your hair too? Wear clothes that show zero skin? Pray 7 times a day? Shes a fucking asshole. \n\nNTA. And if i could, ild buy you and your friends all scorpion bowls.", "So do you get in trouble if you do other haram behaviors, or is it just drinking?

Your life choices are between you and your creator. We are able to inform you why it would be haram according to our religion, but to sit there and call you disgusting I feel is more haram than the act itself. As you stated, you informed her that you guys were going to a club and that drinking was going to be involved. She was well informed. Not fault of yours, entirely hers. Why she got mad? As stated before, maybe because she gave into the pressure of going into the club though she said she wouldn\u2019t. Or\u2026 maybe because she was giving into the pressure of wanting to try alcohol seeing that you all were having a great time and she couldn\u2019t contain herself any longer. But wasn\u2019t mature enough to place the blame on herself and stormed off like a child blaming other people for her mistakes of low confidence because she thought her faith was stronger than that. For her to get mad, sounds much like her problem and not yours.", "As a Muslim who never drank and actively avoid even touching a bottle of alcohol, NTA! She isn't even supposed to go to the club if that wants to be that righteous. You can't have both", "This could have turned into such a lovely arrangement.

If you were pressuring your Muslim friend to violate her privacy religious beliefs, that would be different.

When we go to restaurants they respect me and, if they drink, keep it to a very minimum.\n\nKhadija was warned, and maybe she didn't know what she was getting herself into, but that doesn't excuse her lashing out on you.

Truthfully, if she felt that strongly about the drinking, she shouldn't have gone to a club in the first place. She can't police your behavior because of her religion.

She is entitled to her beliefs and you made sure to ask her and warn her you would be drinking. You were respectful. She was not. She basically lied to you and said she was OK with it then punished you by throwing a tantrum when you didn't read her mind and realize that was basically a test of your loyalty.

You saved to go to a resort.  You knew you would want to drink and dance.  One of you was not up for that.  Therefore you all should have said it\u2019s best that person not go because you would be doing those things.  Instead you all decided to follow someone else\u2019s religious restrictions and it blew up because they expected you to follow more of their restrictions.  Going out to a restaurant that this person can eat at, great.  Going on vacation expecting to spend the entire time following one person\u2019s restrictions is going to blow up 99% of the time.", "NTA\n\nThis girl is a bad friend.

You were even willing to skip the club entirely but she insisted.", "NTA. You warned her multiple times. She knew you intended to drink. As another pointed out, it\u2019s not wrong for anyone who isn\u2019t Muslim to drink. And you were very considerate to drink much less than you normally would. She needs to either get over it, or leave the friend group.", "Yup, NTA. This person laid it out pretty good. Your friend is an asshole and ruined your trip because of her assholery.

She doesn't get to chose only the convenient part if she wants to be a strict Muslim by imposing her religion on others.", "The Jewish side of my family used to come spend Christmas with us. One time my cousin even ate ham, and we were all like um you're eating ham. Their dad said it's up to them how strictly they stick to their religion, and that it was OK cause the hand of God will strike them down if he sees fit.

As someone who's grown up in a Muslim household, i have a lot of difficulty understanding this story. Ive never seen someone behave like this in my life and I've been around some ultra Conservative peeps. The closest I can figure is that she's probably had a crisis of faith and is taking it out on you. That's a her problem, not a you problem. You don't have to bend over backwards for her, if she wants to be around alcohol, let her know it's her choice and that you fully expect her to take responsibility for her choice.
