It's a very fancy one and everyone saved up enough money to afford their share. The resort has a night club inside and we were really excited to go to but knew we couldn't. The thing is Khadijah (whom we call Dhijah) is Muslim and she doesn't like going to clubs or be around alcohol, it's because of her religion and we all respect that. We never drink any alcohol around her or even make or mention any plans that she will not be able to attend.\n\nWell to our surprise, Dhijah said that it was fine for us to go to the club, we didn't want to as she would be left out but she said she doesn't mind coming with us. We told her that so many people will be drinking and even we will because it's a night club and we don't want to her to feel pressurized to do things out of her comfort zone just to fit in. She said it was fine and dragged us with her to the club.\n\nWell we didn't mind. Me and my friends excluding Dhijah tried to keep the alcohol on the low and got no more than 2 shots, but we all stayed together so Dhijah came kinda close when we drank. Dhijah looked at us weirdly when she saw us drink and stormed out. We thought she was probably tired but one of my other friends Elena suggested we go after her.\n\nAnd so we did, when we stepped out of the club we saw Dhijah walking away about to take the path to the rooms (our rooms were pretty far). We called out to her so many times but each time she would just walk faster, it's not like she didn't hear us because we were screaming pretty loudly. \n\nIt came to the point that Elena had to run to Khadijah, she managed to stop her and we all caught up with them. At this point Dhijah was fuming. We asked her if something was wrong and why she was avoiding us and she said because what we did was haram. We looked to each other and asked her what happened. \n\nShe basically said that we disrespected her by drinking in front of her and that we were just huge brats. I then went on to tell her that we did warn her we would be drinking and she went to a club, what did she expect and that we also drank very less because of her and that she even said it was fine. \n\nShe said that she didn't actually think we would drink and that we were disgusting for disrespecting her and her religion. That isn't true, we have so much respect for both her and her religion, we didn't want to upset her. \n\nThe next day aka yesterday went super bad, we woke up had breakfast, lunch, packed our bags and checked out and yet no one said a word though Khadijah gave us some looks. \n\nWe never meant to disrespect or upset her.

It's her religion, the only person who should be following it is her. It's rude to impose one's religion onto another. I myself am Hindu so I don't eat beef but that doesn't mean I stop all my friends from eating it and drop people for eating beef. It's my religion only I have to follow said practice. Also wtf did she expect when going to a pub? It's literally a place meant for drinking? Drop her, religious nuts who try to force their religion onto others are not worth the trouble.", "NTA.

I have Muslim friends and family and would never drink around them. BUT if they also wouldn't go to clubs or bars etc. Dijah had some nerve insisting on going to a club and THEN being all angry because you drank, though you had already told her you would!

When I lived abroad there was a Muslim girl in our friend group. She didn\u2019t drink but always said she didn\u2019t mind if we drank around her.

Did she get mad that everyone around her was drinking too?", "NTA Her religion doesn't give her the right to dictate your actions. She sounds controlling and manipulative.", "NTA. \n\nYou do not have to follow her religious beliefs, and she cannot impose them on you.   \nYou already bend over backwards to accomodate her, more than you are obliged to do IMO.", "Many Muslims live in this confused state having been given constant double standards that don\u2019t make any sense.

It appears she set all of you up on purpose.  \n\nYou all respected her social and religious boundaries. You deprived yourself of social customs that are not a barrier for any of you so she would be comfortable.  I think a conflict for her was you doing that while knowing she would not do the same for you.  \n\nOne has to ask why a girl with very very strict social rules to live by has not sought out people who share her beliefs as friends.  Perhaps she wanted to believe she could live in a world wider than her religion but began to feel very angry that you were able to be her friend without changing your own beliefs.  \n\nShe may have had family and other friends telling her your wicked ways would corrupt her eventually.  So she set you all up to see what going to a club is like, watching you all enjoy yourselves when she said it was ok, etc.  she may have believed your restraint suggested all of your friend group really wanted to acknowledge the rightness of her beliefs.  \n\nThe club situation showed her that without her, you and the group enjoyed a very different way of life; that you were just making the friendship work by accommodating you; not by converting.", "NTA, you're not Muslim so your choices have nothing to do with her.", "I don't usually comment on AITA posts, but NTA.

Someone who doesn\u2019t keep kosher is not going to be offended when someone else doesn\u2019t keep kosher so of course they are tolerant.  \nA Jew who IS kosher will not mind eating with someone eating non kosher food in their presence and that is analogous to the girl in the post who should not dictate what others eat or drink n their presence unless it impacts them.
