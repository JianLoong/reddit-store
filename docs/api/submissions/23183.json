He was always so chill and we'd make small talk occasionally, but I wouldn't say we're friends. He kind of gives off this weird vibe but everyone just ignores it.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem started about two months ago when I caught Tyler full-on staring at me and Sienna across the room during class. I just frowned at him, confused as to why he was looking at us like that, but I ignored him and looked away. I thought maybe he was zoning out and was accidentally death-staring at us. But then we'd catch him constantly staring at either one of us repeatedly, and every time we caught him, he'd just smirk and keep on looking. This went on for weeks that it was starting to freak us out and we dreaded going to classes and attending lectures or even walking by ourselves around campus.\r  \n\r  \nToday was the worst 2 hours of our lives in class as we literally felt his eyes on us for the entire duration of class. We both were extremely uncomfortable and Sienna, who was already having a really rough day, was livid she couldn't contain her anger and she just started crying. So when class ended, I told Sienna to wait for me outside and I waited until everyone left before I approached him. I asked him wtf his problem was and told him that if he had something to say to us then he should just tell us rather than being a creep and staring at us without saying anything because it was making us uncomfortable and weirded out as he's been doing that for too long. He laughed and got all defensive saying that I was just being an insecure little bitch and that he can look at whoever he wanted to look at before he angrily stormed out of the room.\r  \n\r  \nIt didn't take long before two of his friends, who are in the same class as us, texted me and called me an asshole for approaching him like that and making a scene out of nothing when all he did was look at us from across the room.

You absolutely did the right thing. You've made clear that the two of you are uncomfortable with his staring and he dismissed it.  If this problem continues to persist, report it.", "NTA. He\u2019s being a creep and it\u2019s socially unacceptable. Let the other people know to pay attention to him in class. Let the instructor know. Ask them to witness his out of line behavior and call him on it. It\u2019s not ok. You are in the right. \n\nIt\u2019s right to ask him not to. If he continues. Before the next class, reply to those others to watch him. Before class tell the instructor to watch but not intervene immediately, to prove that it\u2019s consistent and uncalled for and inappropriate. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame that anyone blames you. He\u2019s being a creep.", "NTA. You did what you've a right to do, and perhaps waited too long since you took some significant harm from it. What your classmate is doing is sexual harassment. And like the old US commercial says, you don't have to take it.", "Hell no. It\u2019s normal to be weirded out by somebody being a freak.", "NTA - you have now requested him to stop staring. If he continues, I would find a guidance counselor and report him.", "NTA- I have using this a derogatory term. But I would totally text the mutuals and ask if they are really gonna be friends with a little b!thx boy who sexually harasses women and if they are cool with it you\u2019ll let all the women in your classes know that they are voyeurs so watch out for them.", "Ymbta depending on how you confronted him. Sounds like it wasn\u2019t a very friendly way especially if others were texting you about it later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA he wasn't bothering you and if you never looked his way you would have never even known what he was doing. your friends reaction by crying was way over the top. he is right he can look anywhere he wants to he doesn't need your permission to look in your direction or at you. if he had approached you or hassled you by sending you messages or phone calls then i could understand your reaction. what does it matter that he is looking at you. his friends texting you about you confronting their friend is what friends do when someone harasses their friend over nothing", "Im curious, where is the SA in this post?
