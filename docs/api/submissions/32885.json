We have the space and the money to make it magical and we truly love hosting. \n\nThe problem is last year. It's important to note that in 2022 I had a falling out with one of my sisters. She refuses to see me, speak to me, or come to any event I will be present for. Last year I assumed she just wasn't coming so I had gifts delivered to her home and thought that was that. We'd have Christmas day as usual, but just not with her and her family.\n\nEveryone else did come for Christmas day. But...they literally went to my sister's home the day before and did everything. Everything. They opened all gifts and did everything that we traditionally do for Christmas day. The rice pudding my SIL brings with a hidden almond and the one who finds it gets a prize...they did that. No rice pudding for our celebration because they had it the day before.\n\nMy mother brings the Christmas crackers. She sticks them in the tree and the kids pull them after opening presents. She didn't bring them because they pulled them all the day before at my sister's. These are not the only 2 things that happened. Everyone brings and shares a tradition. Rice pudding, Christmas crackers, pin the nose on Rudolph...all of the things we do just were not done because they'd done them all the day before.\n\nI have 6 children and the youngest 4 were confused and unhappy because they missed out on so many things they value. The crackers were their favourite. My 2 oldest kids and my husband sort of saved the crackers. My daughter folded crackers out of paper, my son rummaged to little gifts to stick in them, and my husband wrote the jokes (bad dad jokes, lol). It helped, but the younger kids noticed the lack, asked their cousins about it, and felt left out.\n\nSo this year we talked to all the kids and booked 2 weeks in Europe over the holidays. My family is pissed. What about the big dinner? I don't care. We're going anyways.\n\nBut should I feel bad about it? AITA? We have always hosted. We're the big turkey dinner and ham place. 5 courses and party all day and night, and now my niblings won't get that.", "created_utc": 1702395249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18goks5/aita_for_refusing_to_host_christmas_dinner/", "score": 542, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In 2022 the sister found her dream house, but needed a down payment of $400,000 in order to get it.  Sister had the audacity to ask OP to donate $350,000.  OP was uncomfortable asking her husband for that much money and said no.  Sister called OP a bitch and cut contact, refusing to be anywhere OP was going to be, resulting in OP's extended family taking the sister's side and totally dissing OP and her immediate family last Christmas.\n\nOP is absolutely NTA.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/wd5qog/comment/iigjkts/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=mweb3x&utm\\_name=mweb3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button\n\nETA:  Link to last year's post", "OP later replied that her sister expected OP and her spouse to give money for sister\u2019s house purchase and is mad she wouldn\u2019t.

The husband is a generous person and funds the nieces and nephews education.  That alone can run into big bucks.  The greedy sister did not like being told no and broke contact with OP and family.", "I agree with this. You guys seem to be trying to hurt each other on purpose by not talking. \n\n1) Why didn't you bring up the down payment with your husband? The conversation could have gone like, \"Hey DH, Sister wants us to supply her with the downpayment for her house. Don't feel obligated; I'm not comfortable with us taking that much out of our savings, but I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page before I tell her we can't do it, OK?\" And that could have possibly avoided the fall out with your sister. \n\n2) Where were the follow up conversations with your family members? \"It was really sad to see the children so disappointed last Christmas because all of the traditions were done at Sister's house. Do you have any thoughts about how we can avoid that this year? I think we should do crackers at both houses....and maybe we start a new tradition where someone has to find a special ornament on the tree.\"\n\n3) Even if you did decide you were just done with hosting, that's OK, but you could have rolled it out in a kinder way to your family...it seems like you're not hosting to spite them on purpose a bit. Which, I understand being frustrated at them, but what's the long game here? What do you really stand to gain? They're your family, and it doesn't seem like they've behaved egregiously specifically to spite you...it sounds like they were in a weird awkward situation that they didn't know how to navigate well, and they didn't do a great job navigating it. If you want to go to Europe, that's fine, and well within your rights, but consider how you're communicating it.", "I'd say 'avarice' was more the monster than just money, lucky for *our* side OP has the money and OPs Sis and *her* side has the avarice.\n\nOP and family will have a fantabulous time in Europe (Oi! OP, come to Australia next year!) and hopefully start a new tradition of a new Country/Continent each year. Christmas around the world to your hearts content and forget all about shoving half your arm up a dead turkeys bum on the 24th.", "Start an FU binder and document all that has occurred and any future slights.  The fact that grandma is actually backing sister is a deal breaker as far as the hurt grandchildren are concerned.  Your sister highjacked your traditional Christmas and was backed by the family.  Who needs this type of family.\n\nGoing forward, contact your local senior center.  There are sure to be seniors (also known as recycled teenagers) that would enjoy a home cooked meal and family time.  Always remember that \"family\" does not necessarily mean DNA.  It is caring, respecting and loving.", "It is an afterthought if all the Christmas activities and celebrations (in which OPs kids also participate) won't happen. You don't do something like that unintentionally - they knew OP's family won't be there because she didn't know of that gathering because of the drama between the sisters.", "Well now they can do the Christmas Eve stuff on Christmas Day. \n\nSeems like you are just helping them out.", "That sounds like a them problem.", "How very odd.  And yet, they didn't care AT ALL about how your children would feel about being left out of the bigger part of the holiday (the presents and crackers!).  Too bad, so sad.  They made their beds.  They can lie in them.", "Your mother really sucks. So do your siblings and their spouses.", "And your children were sad not to have crackers, rice pudding, and games on Christmas Day, what point is your Mom trying to make? That your children\u2019s feelings are not as important and your nieces and nephews? I am so sorry.", "This is some manipulative BS from your mother right here. They had the whole party last year on Christmas Eve, they can move it too Christmas Day. Extra AH bonus points to your mother for making it all about your nieces and nephews when she intentionally didn\u2019t give a sh-t about your kids and their feelings last year. Damn that\u2019s audacity.", "And did you ask WHY NOONE bothered to tell you that they were doing all of those things the day before? \n\nThey all can be as upset as they want to be, they brought all of this on themselves. Do not give it another though, and make sure you do for your family first.", "You have six children to support and she is asking you for money?!  If she can't afford the down payment, how can she pay a mortgage?  You are better off with her out of your life.  She would probably not stopped at the down payment but would need additional funds to keep the house.", "Wowowowow. Audacious sister you have there. Enjoy Europe!", "INFO: How did you add three children to your family in a year?", "\u2026..and you makes 6?? So does it make that your mum had a fight with your aunt then? Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused now (I do have a fever so it could be just me)", "Wow, the other kids wouldn\u2019t have been confused if they did it twice. The fact that she knew it would hurt your kids and didn\u2019t care makes me furious honestly. Sounds like they wanted to punish you for not giving your sister the 350k. They could easily have brought all the stuff to your place the next day as well. I\u2019m so sorry you family suck so much.", "Well, I was already leaning NTA but that definitely confirms it.\n\nWhy should they care about you hosting, when your sister seems already well equipped to do so? \n\nThey weren't interested in communicating with you last year, to ensure that **all** the children were included, so they can deal with you no longer hosting the big tradition at all.\n\nThey picked your sister's side, didn't care about your feelings or the feelings of your children (which is the more egregious offense), but were more than happy to show up and take advantage of your hospitality. Because that's exactly what they're doing, taking advantage. Of course they're upset! They wont get the free expensive meal that they're used to. Oh well. They did it to themselves.\n\nI hope you enjoy Europe and are able to start new fun traditions with your children!", ">She said they were at my sister's place first so they decided to just do everything there. She knew it would hurt my kids, but not doing it would hurt my sister's kids and confuse the other kids.\n\nWhy couldn't they do at least some parts twice?", "That\u2019s BS- all of this could be done the second night *as well*.", "How would it hurt your sisters' kids? They would be doing the activities on the same day they always had. They should have told you that they had decided to make your sister's celebration the traditional one from here on it and you could have saved yourself a whole lot of grief.", "So, what, mom gave all your kids' crackers to your sister's kids because they couldn't be happy unless they got their own AND their cousins?", "That's bs. They could have done half of the traditions in one place and half on yours, or do them all twice. They did it to hurt you and your family, make no mistake about that. She literally admitted doing that to your kids, knowing they would be hurt, but chose your sister's kid.\n\nAnyway, make last year's Christmas the last one you host. Not just this year, travel every year - make it your new tradition (you seem to have the funds for it). Or have it just with your nuclear family and family from your husband's side. When they ask, tell them they hurt your children on that year's shenanigans, and you won't ever allow them to manipulate you and hurt your family again because of money. If the want to try to repair the relationship, great, but Christmas is off the table.", "Thanks for the clarification! I\u2019m assuming the crackers are probably a UK thing? They sound like a lot of fun and I\u2019m kind of sad I\u2019ve never experienced them. I can see why your kids are upset they missed out.", "If I could turn back the clock I would just give her the money to avoid this whole thing.", "I just read your previous post.  Your greedy sister apparently thinks that \"ATM\" is tattooed on your forehead.  He has been more than generous to their children and his MIL.  What would she do if all educational funding was cut off?  She would never be satisfied.  It would always be something else.  Be glad that you don't have to be a party to her melodrama.", "I completely disagree with this. \n1) She did not need to ask her husband for the money. She didn\u2019t want too, the end. FFS it was 350k. Just no.\n2) Why does OP need to do all the heavy lifting here. Is her family that clueless ? Do they just not care about her kids \n3) why does she need to be kinder to them. My god her and her husband basically bank roll this entire clan. From their houses to their school fees. Yeah no.\nSometimes people are just done. Sounds like her family has been taking advantage of their generosity for years with no consideration.", "Lol what. Absolutely not, pt sister had no right to ask for this. And she owes the rest of the family nothing, not financially and not with hosting. She didn't need to \"roll it out kindly,\" after they literally used her last year while excluding her children from all traditions. Trying to place any blame on OPs for this is insane, she needs to cut them all off if they can't apologize and figure out a better way to deal with things. If the family will turn their back over OP not gifting 350k, then OP needs to stay away from all of them.", "Yes to this idea of visiting a Senior home and having a traditional Christmas there.  Your kids and the lonely seniors will love it.", "They are going to Europe for two weeks with 8 people. I get the feeling that there is not a concern about supporting 6 children. They sound like the McCallister family. Don\u2019t get me wrong, sister is for sure the AH\u2026.im just pointing out that I don\u2019t think they are hurting for money here.", "I didn't (though we did add a nephew). 3 was a typo. I have 6 children.", "I think she\u2019s saying she comes from a family of 6 AND she has 6 children. At least I hope so or I\u2019m also confused", "So much for a caring grandmother.", "Absolutely not! They don't deserve your money at all.\n\nAnd the fact that your family sides sister? It shows where their loyalty lie. If sister got that money, you don't think the rest of your family would start asking for money too? That's the sole reason they picked her side. Not because you're wrong, but because they're trying to bully you into becoming an ATM. Yesterday it's sisters dream house, tomorrow it's your cousins dream wedding.\n\nThe fact that they had the audacity to still come over to your house knowing they had done the traditions your children enjoy is CRAZY. Disrespectful to you **and** your kids?\n\nProtect your kids from this behavior. Enjoy your trip, you have your own family to love and be loved by unconditionally.", "Bro you don\u2019t owe your sister shit lmao. Like would it be really nice of you to give her some money and maybe help build trust? Yes definitely. \n\nBut your sister doesn\u2019t have a right to your money and is being unfair by blocking you out over it. You\u2019d have been *nice* to give her money, you\u2019re not being mean by not giving her money.", "She would find other reasons to get more money or make other jealousy arguments. You could not win this, no matter what you would do.", "No, no, no. The correct response from your sister was I understand not calling you a bitch and cutting you off. Her doing that means you did the right thing actually, she only sees you as a piggy bank which is disgusting for a sibling.", "I never said she needed to gift anything, nor did I say she owed them anything. I'm just saying there's got to be a better way to communicate with her family than what she's doing. For me, even if something is a quick and obvious \"No\" in my mind, if someone asks me to bring it up with my partner, I say I will so that he has an opportunity to weigh in. 99/100 times, we're aligned in our thinking and I circle back with the no, and it's usually way better received than a straight no off the bat. Also, where did you get $350K from? I didn't see that anywhere?\n\nEDIT: Maybe I'm reading this differently from folks. I just don't think there was sinister intent on her family's part. It sounds like they made a misguided, dumb judgment call. If there was purposeful spiteful intent from the family, then yeah they suck hard and OP should go to Europe.", "NTA they made their choice last year \u2026. Sister can now host in the future and you can go enjoy a wonderful holiday with your partner and kids \u2026. Truthfully I wouldn\u2019t even give it a second thought \u2026 this could be a wonderful new family tradition ( you could pick a new place every year and go explore)", "Yes, sorry for not being clear. I am from a family of 6 and I also have 6 children. We're a large family.", "Yeah there is sinister intent. If you click on OP\u2019s profile you\u2019ll see previous posts and comments. You\u2019re definitely missing the whole story", "You think them doing all of their traditions the day before Christmas without OP or her immediate family present and then just showing up at her home for her food but without what they would normally bring because they did it all the day before was a simple misunderstanding? No. They used OP for her big dinner and were malicious with their intent. They all knew what they were doing and are now pissed that it\u2019s backfired and someone else has to make Christmas dinner.", "All good. I have to ask, did not one of your siblings stand up for you last year? You mentioned that everyone does something for the celebration. Did none of them also do their part at your house?", "My oldest brother stood up for me when he found out. He wasn't there (he lives in France) but he thought it was all stupid and pointed out that mom could have bought 2 packages of crackers, SIL could have made 2 rice pudding, etc. But everyone else just seemed to do whatever my mom wanted.", "I have the feeling that your sister is your mom\u2019s favorite. Am I correct? Because this is absolutely ridiculous. You\u2019re 100% NTA; enjoy Europe!", "Oh well then, fuck all of them except your brother. Hopefully you\u2019ll get some time with him in Europe. I\u2019m going to suggest you and your husband give them no more money (unless it goes directly to their kids). They intentionally hurt you and your children because you wouldn\u2019t buy you sister a house. They don\u2019t appreciate your generosity or deserve it. It sucks of course because being generous is who you and your husband are, but it\u2019s not working out because instead of being grateful they\u2019re acting entitled."]}
