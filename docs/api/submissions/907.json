You can decide what to do with it.", "NTA   \nYou are the owner and they need to move the stuff. Your previous tenant didn't have the authority to give your space away.   \nThey know that, and they're just being difficult.", "NTA\n\nThe agreement was with the previous tenant which could be revoked at any time since it\u2019s an assigned spot that belongs to your unit. The agreement doesn\u2019t carry-over to future tenants, nor does it have any legal standing.", "NTA\n\nYou are the owner, period. It doesn't matter if they had an agreement with the former tenant, that was null and void the second the other person moved out and they full well know it. They're just being difficult and assholes. Give them a notice that it has to be moved out or you'll have it removed yourself. They have no leg to stand on.", "NTA- you own that space. Give them 3 days to clear thier stuff then throw it away.", "NTA - you are the legal owner, the renter technically can not give up your property and I'd tell the other 2 owners either move or I'll have a trash removal company come at your expense. Unless you live somewhere with crazy property laws.", "NTA send them a date to vacate your spot or an outrageous offer to rent/sell them the space.", "NTA. It\u2019s your space, and a huge perk for a renter. They need to move their stuff before you have it hauled off. If they refuse to move it, in the trash it goes.", "NTA.  If you own the apartment and the space is part of the deal it is yours to do with as you see fit.  Not sure that your previous tenant even had the right to allow them to use it without your permission, but if it worked at the time, so be it.  Now the tenant is gone so the agreement is broken.  If your new tenant wishes to use the space, it should absolutely be cleared for them to do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As others have suggested, I would send them a formal notice that the things will be removed by X date. Then I\u2019d have a trash company take it. This is honestly absurd and it sucks that they\u2019re owners. I have similar neighbors and when I found out they owned their house I was devastated.
