But these children are getting their needs met and have social lives with other children their age. And with split households such a standard is incredibly unfair especially when one of those parents is giving more time and attention than the other.

The best we can do as parents is focus on the best interest of the children and let the rest go. \n\nYou are also a soft AH for passively aggressively telling his parents what happened. They should not be put in the middle of any arguments. If anything it should be addressed directly with the partner in as calm a way as you can or directly with your ex. It\u2019s okay to be venting to your side of the family/your friends but be mindful because venting can easily become malicious bad mouthing and your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve that.

Oh, and I think its noteworthy that with your work schedule, you are able to pretty well maximize what time you do get with your daughter.\n\nAs for the financial stuff, that sounds like sour grapes. Especially from your ex.\n\nYour finances are in better shape than theirs. Of course you can spend more on her than they can on the kids in their household. You have more to work with. Why should you artificially limit yourself because of their limitations?\n\nAsk yourself, if your financial positions were reversed, would they hesitate to spend more than you could?\n\nSadly, this may be an old saw you'll see trotted out for decades to come...", "NTA.\n\n\"Keep it civil\", oh so easy to tell that to those suffering incivility from entitled A holes. He should tell that first to the shiny perfect mother.", "What does it say when your ex's parents like you better than them?\n\nNTA", "NTA if both children were biologically his partners kids he could send one away because she was unwell. it was his parenting time so he had to parent. if anyone is a part time parent it is him.", "I don\u2019t think he has any right to close that door.  If the OP and her daughter choose to have a relationship with her former in laws she has every right to continue.", "She definitely won't replace it if it gets \"lost\" or damaged.  That's for sure.  The step-mom seems to project a lot of her perceived failings onto OP", "Why are you getting downvoted?  That's very often a teacher in-service day, so they don't have kids there the same day a bunch of strangers are walking in and out of the school.", "OP says they're in the UK, which last had an election day in May.", "Oh, but they have a valid excuse because ... Gazpacho?", "If you're going to quote OP on this, then you should also quote from her post itself, which says \"and then Sunday she'll go to her dad's\".\n\nWhich put together means she's counting the nights that she has her daughter. A normal way to count that, particularly for someone that works overnight shifts. \n\nAnd by my reckoning, that adds up to 4 nights. Which is more than half the nights in the week.\n\nEven with afternoon pickup, she only has to have her daughter from some time early Sunday morning to go over 3.5 days. Which is more than half the week. By Sunday afternoon, which would be a more logical time for switchover thsn Sunday morning, it would be pushing 4 whole days.", "No, you were not. You are projecting what happened to you in this situation which does not sound as similar as you think. For one the kid is NOT a latchkey kid and two it is a mother working three 16 not 5 or more days a week. Hi former latchkey kid and caseworker."]}
