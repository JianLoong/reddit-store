But these children are getting their needs met and have social lives with other children their age. And with split households such a standard is incredibly unfair especially when one of those parents is giving more time and attention than the other.

No but coparenting isn\u2019t always fair and you have to have some boundaries to keep the peace.

The best we can do as parents is focus on the best interest of the children and let the rest go. \n\nYou are also a soft AH for passively aggressively telling his parents what happened. They should not be put in the middle of any arguments. If anything it should be addressed directly with the partner in as calm a way as you can or directly with your ex. It\u2019s okay to be venting to your side of the family/your friends but be mindful because venting can easily become malicious bad mouthing and your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve that.
