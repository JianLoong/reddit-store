She meant it. All of the other stuff can be talked through - pick up times, what toys to bring when visiting, etc., but the petty bullshit needs to stop or talking can't happen.\n\nETA: If new partner doesn't want damaging stuff repeated...", "NTA - if your Ex doesn't want you spilling Tea to his parents, he shouldn't be encouraging your continued contact with his parents.  If he's going to leave that door open, then he has to accept that they will be privy to your perspective as well as his.  This doesn't give you carte blanche to stir up trouble, but its silly to not expect that a deep cut like \"part time mother\" wouldn't get around.", "NTA\n\nYou are not a part time mom, you are following the current parenting plan.  You happen to have a job where you work non-traditional hours.   If you had full time custody of your daughter, you'd find a different way of managing.  \n\nThe American Girl dolls are a distraction.  Just tell your daughter that if she doesn't want to share with her step-sib, not to take those particular dolls to the other house.  She can play with them at your home.", "Why is she allowing her daughter to steal your daughters stuff? Did she get them back? What does your ex says about that?", "NTA. There was no real reason you had to pick up your daughter. If someone was contagious or needed to go to the hospital it would be a different story. And clearly the partner wasn\u2019t too sick to try to start shit with you the next day.", "NTA imo if you have an issue with people knowing what you say don't say it why be an ass and run your mouth and whine when people find out about it and call them out", "NTA The partner shouldn't say anything to you that would make her look bad. She deserves to look bad for being nasty. \n\nWhat your income is and what you spend on your daughter is nobody's business. If they can't compete that is their problem. They can take steps to fix it if it bothers them so much.\n\nI would not send expensive toys with your Daughter to the Ex'es house if it is causing problems. Since you each have the child for half the time, he should pay for the toys kept at his home.\n\nWhen my daughter was young and staying with her Dad he pawned her computer and the nintendo that was purchased for her use. I am very territorial when it comes to my daughter. My Family sent her money for Christmas, and they asked if they could have it to pay the electric bill. My daughter said they could have it. She only lived with him for 1 year, and whatever she brought into the home was community property, and that is wrong.", "NTA \n\nSounds like your ex and his girlfriend is just jealous and taking out their frustrations.", ">he asked why we can\u2019t just be civil for the children\n\nYou are not the person he needs to talk to about being civil.  You were not throwing out insults because you could not take care of the kids when it was your time to take care of them.  He wants to blame you for his parents being mad at him, but they are mad about his new wife's actions, not yours.\n\nNTA.", " NTA she\u2019s their responsibility on Tuesday and if she was too much to care for then they needed to ask their family for help or hire someone. Yes she\u2019s your daughter but child care is their responsibility on the days they have her.", "NTA. Who is she to judge and attempt to besmirch?", "NTA but it's a soft one, you were definitely trying to start drama with that text to your ex in laws, she might have been deserving of the drama but that doesn't mean you weren't threading dangerously close to asshole territory yourself", "NTA. Your ex and his partner are though. You are being civil. The partner is trying to pick a fight. They are being petty and ridiculous. The partner really just needs to keep her nasty thoughts to herself. Her opinion wasn't asked for and I would push that back on her. You work hard, you buy nice things for your daughter. Your entitled to do those things for your daughter. In terms of the pick up, those arrangements are between you and your ex, the partner really needs to stay out of it all together.", "NTA, but maybe they didn\u2019t know your sleep schedule? In that case nobody is an asshole.", "NTA- Keep your daughters expensive items at your house. This is going to be an issue that will get worse", "ESH. Your in-laws aren't a part of your drama with your ex or his partner, leave them out of it.\n\nAnd if she had something rude to say at pickup (why are you even talking to her instead of your ex?), there's still no mandate for you to respond with your own rude remark. Maybe the two of you are more alike than you think.\n\nI get that you didn't want to accommodate them when it was your ex's custody time, but frankly it's a little odd that you wouldn't want to get your own kid away from people who were in a sick household.", "ESH\n\nThere's no reason to drag additional people into this drama.", "ESH\n\nCoparenting should be done between the actual parents. Not via the step parents, not via the ex in-laws. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want your kid\u2019s toys to get used/stolen by people in the other home, don\u2019t send the stuff. \n\nThis conflict you two have is stressful on a kid.
