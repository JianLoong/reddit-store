Many people go back to school as older students and do very well.  Her excuse for not helping you is totally bogus.  Helping you was your choice.  You didn't say that you wanted help back some day.  But it was a pretty big gift for her to belittle in that way.  Your reaction was not good.  I would have been mad, too.  I'm astonished at how she acted, given your sacrifice to help her.", "NTA.\n\nYou were too generous. Maybe its a norm in your family, but to give your college fund away just like that and even portion off some of your wages for housing is just insane to me. You gave her a very cushy ride through college while you worked your butt off and literally gave her your opportunity at higher education. In my moral compass, she owes you one.\n\nNow unless you had some sort of agreement or understanding, she technically doesn't owe you anything if you were to ask a judge. But for what you did and how much she makes now because of it, it's a shame she doesn't have any compassion to want to help out. Not only that, she such an AH for saying going back at 31 is useless. It is never too late to better yourself financially.\n\nWatch out for yourself more in life. We all learn the lesson, sadly yours took a huge financial bite out of you.", "Wooooww.... Rachel sounds like a prize AH! I hope Karma bites her hard! \nYou're NTA OP, I hope you can find a way to graduate and better your life. Considering her income, I'd consult a lawyer about suing her.", "NTA. I'm sorry your sister is such an ungrateful, entitled person.", "NTA, that's really shitty of her", "Of course NTA. I think it's fair to state your opinion. Now do your best to make sure you can graduate and be successful.", "NTA She is not only ungrateful, but consciously chose on purpose to throw her ingratitude in your face.  \n\n\nSure, you could have chosen to ignore her remarks or tone down your words, but she has no thought for your feelings, so why should you concern yourself with hers?", "NTA and wow your sister sounds awful. You literally gave up your college fund for her, the least she could do is repay that much, but instead she insults you and calls your dreams of improving yourself a waste? What an AH. How on earth did she expect you to react to that?", "NTA  \n\n\nJust remember this, and put yourself first.", "NTA It is a shame that she doesn't feel she should reciprocate even a portion of what you did for her. Being angry I think is natural. Unfortunately she is right about what she said. You are a generous caring person, and she obviously isn't.", "NTA. You want to educate yourself and there is nothing wrong with it. Being a family member and not helping is what mainly makes your sister the AH. There is no fixed age for education. \n\nAlthough pointing out what you did for her might be a lil rude as you don't help in expectations of getting a repayment. It's more of the sister's responsibility to remember that it's because of you that she got a good job but since she doesn't wanna help you I suggest you don't point out how you helped her. Instead study with whatever you get from your parents and maybe work a small job on the side. \n\nWish you all the best!\ud83e\udec2", "INFO: have you applied and know what your costs would be, or was this just a general conversation about you wanting to go back to school that somehow included a request for future money?", "Totally NTA. I can't imagine why she thinks it's too late for you to go back to school. You're not even halfway through your life. And while she may not \"owe\" you she OWES you, at the very least, respect. \n\nHer family, including you, helped her when she needed it. Your family, including her, should help you with your needs. That is what families do for each other. If she refuses to help she is totally TA.", "NTA.  Your sister is very selfish and entitled.  I hope you find a way to continue to your education and good luck with it.", "NTA- \n\nShe's just being selfish, pure and simple. To put down your dreams is also pretty shitty. You're 31! Besides, getting your degree is never useless at *any* age.", "NTA and YIKES. Sis said studying at \"this age\" is \"totally useless\" when its so obviously not. Does she think you're dumb or something? Is that the reason she thinks you shouldn't be studying? Sis sounds like a piece of work, SMH.", "ESH you lashes out pretty badly so the choice of words maybe not but your sister is also the AH for discouraging you from going back to school.", "ESH. In my personal opinion, being kind and helpful does not entitle you to your sister's money. While you're free to ask for help, she's free to decline. Her way of declining is gross, however, and saying that studying is \"useless\" and a waste at this age is just plain wrong. Lashing out at her and insulting her is out of line, no matter how disappointed you feel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Talk about a complete waste of your time. NTA", "NTA. I went back to school at 30 and your sister is ageist and ignorant. Many people start second careers after 30 because they ended up hating the choice they made as teenagers. It's not like you were asking her for money so I think your anger is about her being unsupportive when you supported her. Sorry she's so selfish.", "NTA, I would cut that bitch out of my life if I was you.", "NTA- I am a firm believer in public shaming lol. Put her on blast on Facebook", "ESH - Rachel should've kept her opinion to herself and been happy for you for wanting to go to college, but she does bring up a good point. You chose to help her, it wasn't forced on you from what I gather, so you don't get to behave as though she owes you anything.\n\nThe best thing you can hope for is her verbal support, which she clearly didn't give, now all you can do is prove her wrong. But throwing in her face what you've done, even if she benefitted and you sacrificed, doesn't mean she's in your debt forever. Not unless you had some sort of payment contract set up before you began that arrangement. \n\nESH", "You're only 31. I restsrted school at 33 and its the best decision I everade and I love it AND im doing way hetter snd getting lore opportunities than the first time I did it.", "YTA for throwing your past charity at her like a weapon. When you help others you do so without the expecation of repayment. What happens if right after she graduated she died, would you expect the money back?  Honestly saying what you do made you the AH at that point. It's why this is bugging you so much.  Take a breath and realize that after 25 y/o in most cultures at least, asking for money from others starts to become socially unacceptable.\n\nNow Sister is slightly an AH for saying at your age it's worthless as that's obviously ignorant also but the judgement for the title is rendered.", "You would think she'd at least owe her moral support. Sis definitely an AH.", "Thanks mate", "I'm in the process of applying, the total cost for all the years would be 70k, I already have 25k from savings and what my grandparents left me, and my parents are helping me with 25k from their retirement fund (I'll make sure to gave them back) so she should have given me the remaining 20 k (if you want to know the fund gave her was 60k).", "People who go back to school are brave ,your sister just showed you her true figure! Do your best,got your degree/master and go kick ass!!", "ESH. You\u2019re acting a bit entitled to her help, bordering on demanding it when she doesn\u2019t share the same values as you. I call her an asshole because she is being shitty about it but your attitude isn\u2019t much better. She doesn\u2019t technically owe you anything. Morally maybe but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to absolve you.
