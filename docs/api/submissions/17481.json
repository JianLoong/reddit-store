Three of my grandparents\u2019 children decided to visit them along with their families on short notice. My family would join everyone Saturday morning.\n\nEverything went smoothly for breakfast then the \u201cadults\u201d began talking about the old days so us kids decided to go to a different room. My grandparents\u2019 TV is still connected to an old DVD player next to their enormous collection of movie DVDs, so the cousins and I went through it together. My cousins were uncle Jeff\u2019s daughters - 15 twins Grace and Kim. The other cousin was aunt Liz\u2019s Billy (4) that aunt Liz usually keeps near her (she\u2019s a single mom) and we did not invite to go through the DVD with us.\n\nWe found The Matrix trilogy and Grace said she never got to finish it  while Kim said she meant to watch but never had the chance to. I myself have already watched the trilogy but thought they should get to enjoy it so while they watched, I was mostly playing around on my phone, not really paying attention. \n\nHalf way through the movie, I heard aunt Liz screeched \u201cwhat are you doing?!\u201d. Looking up, I saw Billy in the room with us while aunt Liz was standing in the doorway. I soon learned that Billy snuck out from the adult room and probably had been quietly watching the movie with us for over 15 minutes while aunt Liz was busy. \n\nAunt Liz berated us for watching an R-rated movie while Billy was around and also that Grace and Kim were too young to watch without parental supervision and nobody asked uncle Jeff or their mom if they could. She said it was irresponsible of me as the oldest cousin to let these things happened. \n\nI told her she was being ridiculous on both accounts. It was her fault Billy escaped her \u201cloving bubble of control\u201d and Grace already saw part of The Matrix anyway with her maternal family. They were OK with it, so that should be good enough.\n\nThe \u201cadults\u201d came because of the commotion. Uncle Jeff rolled his eyes a bit and told aunt Liz his kids can watch the trilogy. Aunt Liz said that didn\u2019t mean it was appropriate for us to just go ahead without asking the parents first. And this is Billy\u2019s grandparents\u2019 house so he should be free to roam around without having to be afraid of accidentally seeing blood and violence. My grandparents just told us to turn off the TV and everyone had a rather awkward lunch before my family left.\n\nKim sent me a text this morning about what a shame it was we didn\u2019t get to finish the movie. Her mom spoke to her and Grace later that she didn\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire with aunt Liz but she would really appreciate it if the girls would discuss future viewing of R-rated movies with her first.

If your 15 yo cousins were not sure they were allowed to watch the movie, it was their responsibility to ask their parents. \n\nIf Liz was going to let 4 yo cousin go in the room with the older cousins, she should have gone in and asked if you were OK with watching him.

For any of it.  A long as the kid's parents were not upset with you, don't sweat it.", "NTA.  The Matrix isn't exactly a hard R rated movie and doesn't have anything overly explicit, gory, or traumatizing unless I'm really forgetting something.  Liz is way over the top protective and honestly if she's that concerned should have been keeping a closer eye on little Billy.", "NTA. They are 15 and I assume you are not baby-sitting them.

This logic would only apply if Billy was in his own house. \n\nNTA. You did not know Billy was in the room. And 15 minutes of R rated material is not going to traumatize him. Sounds like Aunt Liz is mad Billy got away from her and she took her frustration out on you.", "NTA at all. I know all families are different, and approve of different things. My kids however (ages 2, 10, and 6) have watched the Matrix movies, Jurassic Park movies, MCU movies, and they are fine. I know some kids may not like action movies, but it sounds like your cousins were fine (not scared, traumatized, etc).
