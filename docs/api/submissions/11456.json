You should be able to manage your period with whatever method works for you. Pads are unsanitary during swimming. This is very concerning to me that she is so adamant that you do not use them, and that she is punishing you so severely. She is not thinking rationally in regards to your physical or emotional well being.

With a parent like this, you can wait out her craziness (keeping them in your locker) or try to address it.  Only you know your mom and how she would/could react.  \n\nMom,  You are my mom. This is your home and while in your house, I will respect YOU. This doesn't mean I will follow every rule you've laid down but I will do my best to communicate when one of your rules are an issue. This is not about trust or the tampons. This is a control issue. I understand you are the parent here but you've done a good job. I'm a good kid, prioritizing school. One day I will move out of this house and I want to have a relationship with you. I fully expect you to parent 15 year old me.  However I don't want how you choose to do this to impact a future relationship with adult me.", "NTA", "Your NTA and I'm sorry that your mom is being so unreasonable", "NTA - your mom is being incredibly irrational by banning them, and borderline abusive by screaming instead of explaining. Personally I wouldn't want my kid using them either because they're wasteful and there's a risk of TSS, but she should be talking to you about that and giving better alternatives. Cups are great. They're medical grade silicone so safe if you clean them well, and they're reusable. As others have mentioned period swimsuits are also supposed to be very effective (can't personally speak to the swimsuits, though I like the underwear or reusable pad options I've tried).", "NTA", "She's afraid that they will damage my insides or I could get an infection from them.", "No I don't believe it is, but I will store some tampons in my school locker from now on. Thanks for the advice!", "I never considered that my mother will do the same to her, thanks so much for reminding me. I'll make sure to keep a stash for her when she's older.", "I'll bring up the idea to her, thank you so much!", "Thank you so much, I'll bring the idea up to her when she's in a better mood!", "Infections can be avoided if you change them regularly, and you won't be damaged. They can be uncomfortable if you use the wrong size, or insert them incorrectly, but you shouldn't have anything to worry about if you follow the instructions that come with the box.", "She is probably more afraid that they make you loose your \"virginity\". This is ridiculous.", "Honestly, your mom sounds like her main issue is; if its not her way, its wrong. Also sounds like her mindset that any form of 'penetration' is wrong, is her main driving point. \n\nFirstly, shame on her. Every individual body has different needs. You use them because you swim. Her issue here sounds more like she cant un-sexualize that part of the body. That the idea of tampons makes her so uncomfortable she looses her mind, means she unfortunately is an immature thinker. \n\nThe leriod underwear is a great option. But as a parent myself, im gona bet $10 she isnt ok with even those, because its not what SHE thinks is right. \n\nPersonally, Id keep doing what you normally do, just try to hide em' a little better. Keep em' in your closet or something. Get the period underwear, try em' out they're awesome! But be prepared for your mom to be upset at anything different than her way. Best of luck Op. \n\nThese types of mom dont budge. And the spouse always agrees, because taking your moms side is easier than trying to convince your mom shes mistaken.", "Well I hope it helps ! I\u2019m an absolute convert to the period panties, even though I used a moon cup for many years. I find them so comfy I basically wear them all the time. And I get far fewer cramps, which is an added bonus\u2026", "Seems like forcing somebody to hide their supplies is a great way to encourage unsafe use", "Yes, the mother is being ridiculous. I get being concerned, because TSS is a real and very dangerous thing, but fifteen is plenty old enough to make decisions about how to handle her own period. Completely banning the use of tampons is over the top.", "I was less generous in my assumptions\u2014I assumed the mother was acting out of some kind of controlling prudishness rather than concern over a rare but deadly disease", "That's also a possibility. That was honestly my first assumption as well, truth be told.", "Ask your mother if this can be discussed at your next doctor\u2019s appointment.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry OP! I think it\u2019s time you tell your swim coach, and ask if it\u2019s possible for her to have tampons stored at her office for you.", "NTA your mom is being irrational. What she\u2019s shown you here is that you have to be very careful in hiding behaviours from her because she will completely over-react. Keep your head down until you\u2019re old enough to leave.", "op=NTA \n\nBut the power dynamic is such that you have to live within your parent's guidelines.  Can you keep tampons at school or where you swim?  \n\nOr look into a menstrual cup.", "A lot of people think that you can't use tampons if you've never had sex. It's stupid, but that's an incredibly common belief.", "OP - if you were my friend in school, I would've been totally willing to buy and store tampons for you. If you have a trusted friend to ask, definitely do it. Your mother's rules are completely irrational.", "Mom is clearly controlling but I think you're projecting about the virginity thing. OP has mom's reasoning in the post and it's about a specific, real but avoidable health complication.", "Mine, too.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a big creep caring so much about the sanitary method you choose to use as a 15 year old. As soon as you can, tell her to fuck off and leave that place. The dad agreesing and caring about what you use for your period is also fucking creepy. People like this aren't safe to be around. Get away from them as soon as you can.", "NTA. And your mother is verbally abusive and old fashioned. She is probably afraid that tampons will break your hymen and you won\u2019t be a virgin anymore, assuming you are. I heard this stuff in the very early 2960s and it was old then.", "I concur. NTA.", "Regardless of the reason the mom is against tampon use, the way she reacted (especially under the circumstances that they are used only occasionally for swimming) is completely out of line. Claiming she can't trust you anymore and confiscating electronics over of your choice of period products is absurd. OP the way your mom is treating you is horrible. NTA of course.", "I completely agree.", "As with many people, I vote NTA!", "NTA, your mother is being abusive. Quite frankly, she terrifies me. Coming from the perspective of an adult woman who also has periods, your mom sounds mentally ill, like narcissistic. What does trust have to do with your sexual/reproductive health? She\u2019s being WEIRD.", "This sound like child abuse and a call to CPS is needed. NTA", "NTA. Your mother is irrational, abusive and truly sounds harmful. Im sorry you\u2019re growing up in this environment.", "NTA and as someone else commented, pads are not sanitary during swimming. So tell her you cannot swim during those times due to that.", "Disposable menstrual cup.  They are super easy to use and last a long while between changes.  I would suggest the regular reusable ones but you have to boil those and doubt that would work for you.  You can take in and out in the shower and can rinse and save to throw away at school.  Be prepared for your shower to look like a crime scene but it all rinses away.  In a pinch rinse, was with soap and reuse.  They sell at drugstores.", "NTA. OP, your mother is being ridiculous and controlling. This happened to me when I was your age, except it was my dad who found out I'd used a tampon. My period was so bad that even if I wore the huge maxi pads my parents bought that were basically diapers, I'd get blood on my sheets at night. Everything could have been fixed with a tampon. Instead, my dad absolutely freaked out and kept saying things like \"you lost your virginity to a tampon.\" I will bet money that's your mom's actual concern. \n\nMy advice: Become independent as soon as humanly possible.", "Is a cup a possibility or does she object to them too?", "You cannot wear pads swimming. I\u2019m sorry your mom is being unreasonable. NTA.", "you went behind your mothers back, but she should know that, as a 15 year old young lady, you are developing, and may need tampons and pads and other things. Therefore, ESH", "I'd say get yourself a period cup. One time cost works wonders and f your mom and her moral bs.", "If you talk to the school nurse they may provide them for you. Sorry your family sucks. Start planning now so you can move out at 18. NTA.", "You can also think about trying a Diva Cup. I wasn\u2019t so sure at first but once you learn to use it, it\u2019s fantastic! And you can swim with it too. My sister bought it from a local drugstore, and they last a long time. Best of luck kiddo, send a message if you need to!!", "Actually Tss is nearly non existent with modern tampons.", "I know it's extremely rare nowadays, but you do see the occasional case pop up here and there."]}
