And yeah, the guy is trying to squeeze you out and likely he is just looking for a one night stand. NTA.", "NTA - dude wants to bang her and she hasn't shut the door", "NTA. But honestly, I\u2019d question the relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t automatically unfollow a stranger that insinuates negative things about their relationship/partner. Out of respect/honesty she may have showed you message, but I\u2019d hope she would have been as offended as you. If you hate on my choice of relationship and partner, you hate on me.", "NTA she thinks it would be rude to unfollow him, AFTER HE WAS BEING EXTREMELY RUDE??? You were not a jerk or overreacting, i wouldve reacted so much worse than you did.\n\nI have to say this man, shes a giant red flag.", "NTA. Your girlfriend should have never exchanged IG accounts with him in the first place. By doing that she entertained the idea of dating, which is clearly what he wants. Huge red flag.", "NTA.  Dude was disrespecting you and your relationship and she chooses his (a random guy she met at a bar) feelings over her long term boyfriend.  Red flag", "Definitely NTA based off the precedent set by your girlfriend. The situations may not be the exact same, but the fact you did as she asked without hesitance is a green flag. You respected her feelings and discomfort, why can't she respect yours? \n\n\nINFO: Does she have a problem with saying no/turning people down (even just plans with  acquaintances) because she doesn't want to hurt their feelings? Or is this the first time she's had this come up?", "NTA, he was out of line asking her to leave the relationship. She should have no problem shutting this down. If she is so insistent on following him, that\u2019s a red flag to me", "NTA.  Are you in a dedicated relationship?  If so, why is she accepting drinks from random people in a bar?  I have no problem going out to a bar as a married woman, but I would not accept a drink - that is sort of like opening a door to more communication with the guy.\n\nIf you are supposed to be only seeing each other, consider asking her if that is what she really wants.  Maybe she is feeling like she wants a bit more freedom.  Painful as it sounds, you might save yourself some heartache in the future.  Sorry to be a downer.\n\nOh! and if you and she only see each other... why does she care about following/being followed by this random guy?", "NTA. She is demonstrating a questionable  moral foundation, and this should be a huge red flag to you. You would do well to conclude this relationship and look for someone without the morals of an alley cat", "NTA. Your GF doesn\u2019t want you getting attention but thinks it\u2019s fine for her too. Run mate.", "No, you are not the @ss hole. If you do it for her then what\u2019s the problem with her doing it for you.", "NTA. If only for the reason that your GF has asked you to unfollow people in the past. She set the precedent of the partner being able to curate the other\u2019s social media followers. \n\nBesides, she asked you to unfollow someone for something that happened in the past (I assume from before you were dating). You are asking her to unfollow someone for something that is happening now - he is currently, actively asking her to cheat on you.", "NTA \n\nNow, I do think her request and yours are a bit different in that you\u2019ve already slept with the girl you were following, she should have been unfollowed the moment you entered a relationship, thats my opinion, but good on you for taking her discomfort into consideration.\n\nBUT, it\u2019s pretty clear what that guys intentions are and him deliberately disrespecting you and your relationship shouldn\u2019t have even *just* been an unfollow, it should have been a block.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and her are seemingly okay with that being part of your relationship though so I\u2019m going to look at it from that point of view. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for asking her, once, to unfollow the guy. You\u2019re TA for continuing once she said \u201cno\u201d and gave you her reasoning. She\u2019s TA for asking you to unfollow someone from your past (if that girl really wanted to get back with you I don\u2019t think an unfollow would stop her). \n\nIf you trust your girlfriend leave it at that. Men say dumb things in dms all the time. She wasn\u2019t doing anything shady, in fact she showed you the message which she didn\u2019t have to do.", "Esh - you sleeping with them IS different. Obviously. She still shouldn't have asked you to do it. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who disses my partner.", "Nta. I\u2019d she has already asked you to do the same thing previously then she should too. It can\u2019t be one of rule for one and another for another person in a relationship", "NTA: he wants to bang her and it\u2019s obvious and she hasn\u2019t immediately just blocked contact with him? I\u2019d question whether she really wants to be with you.", "NTA. Honestly, the fact that she didn't block him as soon as he insulting you is concerning.", "NTA- she belongs to the streets. YOU deserve better", "NTA. And it\u2019s over. I know, I know - Reddit loves to just say \u201cBreak up,\u201d but somebody who doesn\u2019t do the most obvious things to manage a relationship isn\u2019t as into it as you, or just has different values. Or even just a different way of handling relationship mechanics. In those cases, you\u2019ll just find your stress increasing over time. Keep a close eye on this.", "NTA. She should have unfollowed him on her own AND she didn\u2019t need to show you a message from a stranger insulting you. IMO accepting a drink from a stranger and then following them on Instagram when you\u2019re in a committed relationship is pretty questionable anyway.", "Why would she unfollow him? It's a win-win situation for her. She's got this guy telling her she can do better so now it's on OP to prove he deserves her and if he doesn't perform then she's got a replacement ready.\n\nIf flattering words from a stranger mean more to her than her relationship then OP can do better. NTA.", "That she didn't unfollow him makes it seem like she was bragging about being hit on rather than trying to be honest or respectful. The point of telling your partner is to reassure them not make them more worried.", "She has dick on deck.\nAlways good to have a backup.", "She likely wants it too. If I were OP I\u2019d cut that off esp after only a year and a half", "Showing the message could have been out of spite or some other ego fueled reason.  \n\nThe relationship sounds a bit toxic.  Only they know that for sure but there appears to be double standards.  If the gf is willing to allow a suitors attention then with enough persistence the suitor may succeed.", "I got that vibe too when he said she showed him the text. If someone said that about my partner, I would never show them the message. I wonder why anyone would. What purpose would it serve besides possibly making your partner feel bad?", "Yeah really hard not to interpret it as her telling him she's got options and she's keeping them open.", "it's just a power play for her own ego. OP Dump this chick before you invest more of your time into someone that is clearly always on the lookout for the next upgrade"]}
