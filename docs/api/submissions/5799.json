{"id": 5799, "submission_id": "zwko6t", "title": "AITA for calling out my parents' favoritism toward some of their grandkids in front of the family and ruining Christmas and New Year's?", "selftext": "I (40F) have four siblings. Between the five of us, my parents have nine grandchildren.\n\nWhile we were at my parents' house for dinner and for the kids to get their presents from them, in the middle of handing out their presents to everyone they gave my nieces \\*Monica\\* and \\*Jill\\* a big box and said that this present was from them and my sister and BIL and it was something they were going to have to share. They opened it up and it was a Playstation 5. Many of my nieces and nephews were upset and jealous over the girls' present and rightfully so. My parents tried to explain that the girls had already expressed interest in sharing one and that their parents asked for help so instead of the girls getting two-three presents like everyone else, my parents put what they would've spent on the girls toward the console and their parents paid the rest.\n\nI called BS on my parents and told them they just showed all the kids who their favorite grandchildren were. My parents said that wasn't true, they didn't spend any more on the girls than they did anyone else and that if there were big purchases we wanted to get the kids they would've helped and that would've been their 'gifts' to them. I told them I didn't buy that one bit or else they would have offered to help instead of waiting to be asked and more importantly they wouldn't have gifted it to the girls in front of everyone. Besides kids don't offer to share things like that. They said that they thought it best to do it there so they could put it into context for all the grandchildren instead of risking the girls saying that they got it from Grammy and Pops. We argued about it and I took my kids and left.\n\nMy parents have been trying to call me since Sunday to talk and my husband thinks I should hear them out. One of my siblings is mad at me because now their kids are all upset because they believed me when I called out our parents favoring Monica and Jill. Now their kids and mine don't want to go over to my parents' house which is ruining New Year's for them because our parents were going to watch any of the kids that needed babysitting, and our parents are upset the kids don't want to go over anymore. I was just advocating for my children but AITA for calling my parents out in front of everyone the way I did?\n\nEdit: There are other instances of my parents favoring Jill and Monica. They'll give Jill and Monica money for their extracurricular trips and similar things, while my brother and I have aired struggling to pay for extracurriculars for our kids before. My parents say and do nothing except tell our kids that they shouldn't give up their hobbies/sports when we made the decision to pull them out. My parents have also been made aware in the past when one of us was struggling to get a gift one of our kids really wanted and not a damn thing was said. So no, I really don't believe their BS story or excuse that they would've given help if asked, they should've brought it up to all of us if they really were asked to help so we could've had the same opportunity with our kids' gifts. Since they didn't, they should have had the girls open the gift at my sister's house, not made an entire spectacle of it.

Yes\u2026YTA", "I\u2019m a little confused. So your parents helped pay for a big gift?\n\nThey didn\u2019t spend anymore money on those kids than the others, so I\u2019m really not understanding why this is favoritism? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re honestly just being really petty right now. \n\nYTA.", "Regardless of whether you believed them or not, YTA for doing this in front of the other kids. And I find your reaction completely extreme.\n\nYou said that sis and BIL asked, and your parents said they would have done the same had anyone else asked. So I don\u2019t think they\u2019re showing any favoritism. \n\nAlthough obviously a feeling of favoritism isn\u2019t a one off thing, so no one could really say without knowing how they treat everyone for all the past Christmases and events.", "So let me ask you this. If the PS5 had just been from the girls\u2019 parents would you still have been upset? \n\nRegardless of the answer, YTA for two main reasons. You say yourself that the same $value was spent on each child. So you have no leg to stand on there. And you called your parents out in front of all the kids. That makes you a massive asshole, purely because now the other kids are going to be seeing a competition where there simply isn\u2019t one. Opening a big ticket item in front of the other kids was always going to cause issues but the rest of it you\u2019ve made up just to be petty.", "YTA. Your parents seem reasonable. They contributed the same value to that gift in lieu of presents. What\u2019s the problem? Why don\u2019t you return all the stuff they bought your kids, and then take that money and purchase a PS5 for your kids?", "YTA. You\u2019ve created a scene in front of the children! Like a child! If your parents are right, and they spent as much money on every kid (I have no reason to believe they lied), your anger is totally misplaced. You threw a fit because your sister and BIL were smarter about their kids present. And your years of sibling jealousy showed up. And now the cousins are mad at each other, the family won\u2019t get together for New Years, what a mess you\u2019ve made. You better apologize to everyone. And go to therapy to deal with your insecurities.", "YTA. Even if you do think your parents lied, there was no need to make a scene and embarrass and upset the kids. If your parents decided to go in with your sibling for one expensive gift instead of four cheaper gifts, they DID do it right, up front so the other kids could hear why and NOT think they were being treated unfairly. \n\nGood that you ruined the NYE plans; maybe next time you want to throw a tantrum, you'll think twice.", "YTA absolutely.   Your logic escapes me; your parents did nothing wrong whatsoever.   Your favoritism argument makes no sense.  Even if it did you don't blow it up into a big public argument.   You're now facing the consequences.   It is your fault NYE is ruined.", "WOW\n\nYTA \n\nYou never do something like that in front of kids. Whether you believe it, or not.\n\nNot knowing the amount that your parents contributed towards the Playstation, or the amount that your parents spent on gifts for the other children..I wont judge them. I tend to believe them though.\n\nThis doesn't sound like you were advocating for your children in this situation. \n\nThis is something else entirely.\n\n\nThe bit about ruining YOUR NYE???

Monica and Jill have to share a single present. Plus the cost was split 4 ways, the parents and the grandparents. I'm not saying the favoritism so far. \n\n>My parents said that wasn't true, they didn't spend any more on the girls than they did anyone else and that if there were big purchases we wanted to get the kids they would've helped and that would've been their 'gifts' to them.\n\nThis sounds reasonable. Every kid got about the same amount spent on them. And your parents have clearly stated they would have done the same for all the grandkids if any of the other parents had asked. Still not seeing that favoritism. \n\n>I told them I didn't buy that one bit or else they would have offered to help instead of waiting to be asked and more importantly they wouldn't have gifted it to the girls in front of everyone. Besides kids don't offer to share things like that.\n\nOr, and hear me out here, the grandparents didn't know what Monica and Jill's parents were planning. Maybe they didn't know if the parents were going to buy the PS5 without their help. But when they were asked they agreed to help. Also, some kids are great at sharing. I don't know how old these two are, but if they're old enough for a PS5 then they're old enough to know how to share. Honestly, it sounds like you're reaching for reasons to be mad. \n\nI don't see any favoritism here. All you did was start drama in front of the kids because...? I can't quite figure out why.

You owe them an apology. 125 and 125 equals 250 which is what they put toward the ps5.", "To claim favoritism, you need to present us with a pattern of behavior. You\u2019ve only talked about this one incident. And, the grandparents argument is reasonable. Given the facts you\u2019ve presented, I\u2019m going to say YTA. You behaved badly.", "YTA\n\n> Besides kids don't offer to share things like that. \n\nYour whole argument hangs on the fact that you wouldn't share gifts or haven't taught your kids to share?\n\nI've seen plenty of kids pool resources starting from kindergarten in order to get big ticket items.

Your parents at no point according to your comment, made any of the grandchildren feel inferior or less than. You\u2019re the one projecting that your kids and the other kids have all missed out.\n\nYou\u2019re salty because your sisters kids got something which appeared more high value in one hit than the multiple smaller gifts the other kids got. And you\u2019re salty because your sis/BIL coordinated the gift with your parents to give the girls what they wanted.\n\nNow you\u2019ve created an absolute shit storm because you\u2019re trying to suggest there is favouritism occurring when there absolutely is none. There is no pattern of it at all.\n\nYou need to apologise to your parents, siblings, niblings and children and explain you\u2019re just salty and pitiful and materialistic.", "YTA I don\u2019t see anything wrong with what your parents did.", "YTA the other kids got 3 gifts each from their grandparents plus gifts from their parents, Monica and Jill got one shared between them from their grandparents and parents- that's not favouritism. My sister and I begged my parents for an xbox back when we were kids saying we would share it (we got it, we did) so maybe you just raised selfish children. You had no buisness having this conversation infront of all the kids either, because you haven't just made things unfairly contentious between your parents and their grandkids, but also Jill and Monica and their cousins for the crime of agreeing to share something they both wanted.", "YTA.", "Kids absolutely do and can share gaming systems all the time. You are just upset that you wanted one for your kids or yourself. \n\nYTA.", "So let me get this straight. Instead of the two girls getting 3 gifts each, they got one gift to share and their parents kicked in for a portion of that gift. \n\nThen you call them out because your kids didn't get a PS5 - which you didn't ask for help with and didn't tell them you wanted to do for your kids.\n\nAND you did this in front of the kids.\n\nYeah YTA. You owe your parents an apology and you need to sit down with the rest of the kids and explain to them why you were in the wrong.", "YTA children are sponges, you just exploded a load of bs in front of them and now they 100% believe that their grandparents don't like them as much as their cousins, this will cause these children to ostracize the girls and the grandparents. \nYou quite possibly ruined the next couple of years for these children, instilling in them an insecurity that should never have been there in the beginning. \nYou honestly need therapy, because if you can flip your lid at a drop of a hat in front of children you have deeper issues you need to look at. \nYou owe a lot of people an apology after that tantrum.", "YTA. They spent the same amount on each kid so there was no favoritism. One sibling group had their money combined for a big gift. This isn't rare. It's the same idea as kids only getting a few small gifts because the family is going to Disney for Christmas or something.\n\nYou started drama for no reason.", "YTA. Also maybe your kids or yourself didn\u2019t offer to not have any gifts and share their budget if they got a console; but yes kids are smart and can and will think of solutions if they really want it. \n\nMy siblings and I did this for when the x-box first came out. No other gifts; we knew the budget limit on gifts; at the time $100 each and begged for it.\n\nYou also expect your parents to volunteer, instead of ask. You didn\u2019t think to ask, never occurred you could; and acted poorly.", "YTA\n\nSounds like the parents paid for most of the PS5 and the grandparents chipped in what they would've spent on the girls instead.", "YTA. I feel you are overreacting and somewhat missing the point of gift giving and Christmas here. Also, get over the angry feelings, answer your family's phone calls and resolve the argument. Make peace with them and apologize for getting so upset and in front of the kids. Is it really worth it to make a big deal about this? How about teaching your kids to be thankful for what they get, given that lots of people and kids get nothing??", "YTA. Grow up.

What a terrible example to set for your children when you could have taught them to be gracious instead. I don't think what your parents did was the best idea, but they didn't do it to intentionally slight you and your children.  Best that you apologize and in the future don't air your disputes with them in front of the children.

This should have been a private conversation among adults. Don't involve the kids, they will remember family drama ruining their holiday and they only get so many holidays as children. I am willing to believe that there may be favoritism, but not based on this scenario alone. Paying the same amount for each grandchild's gift is as fair as you can ask, and if they contributed to a bigger gift instead of getting their own, that's between them and the children's parents. If they went as far as to make it clear in front of everyone that they went in on it with the parents, they're trying to avoid making it look like they have favorites.

And you really think *that* is advocating for your kids? Are you delusional?\n\nYes, you ruined Christmas, and possibly your kids\u2018 relationship with your parents. Well done. Go apologize, and think how you\u2019re gonna fix that.", "YTA you're mad because your sister thought to ask for help paying for the ps5 in lieu of multiple gifts and you didn't.  The same amount was spent on each kid you have nothing to complain about.", "YTA for saying that in front of all the kids.\n\nAlso, your parents story sounds plausible to me. They chipped in two kids X 3 presents worth of funds + the parents paid into the cost of the PlayStation. So four adults\u2019 contributions towards two kids\u2019 presents budget = one PlayStation. What\u2019s so unbelievable about that?\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know what kind of life lessons you\u2019re trying to teach your kids by complaining and name calling when you\u2019re jealous of a present.

I am there for a lot of pettiness, but not this. This is ridiculous. You need to look up what favoritism means bc this is not it.

Adults are supposed to be past the age of believing that the biggest gift is always the best. Do you not understand that multiple gifts can cost as much as one?

Between the five of us, my parents have nine grandchildren. \n\nWhile we were at my parents' house for dinner and for the kids to get their presents from them, in the middle of handing out their presents to everyone they gave my nieces \\*Monica\\* and \\*Jill\\* a big box and said that this present was from them and my sister and BIL and it was something they were going to have to share. They opened it up and it was a Playstation 5. Many of my nieces and nephews were upset and jealous over the girls' present and rightfully so. My parents tried to explain that the girls had already expressed interest in sharing one and that their parents asked for help so instead of the girls getting two-three presents like everyone else, my parents put what they would've spent on the girls toward the console and their parents paid the rest.\n\nI called BS on my parents and told them they just showed all the kids who their favorite grandchildren were. My parents said that wasn't true, they didn't spend any more on the girls than they did anyone else and that if there were big purchases we wanted to get the kids they would've helped and that would've been their 'gifts' to them. I told them I didn't buy that one bit or else they would have offered to help instead of waiting to be asked and more importantly they wouldn't have gifted it to the girls in front of everyone. Besides kids don't offer to share things like that. They said that they thought it best to do it there so they could put it into context for all the grandchildren instead of risking the girls saying that they got it from Grammy and Pops. We argued about it and I took my kids and left. \n\nMy parents have been trying to call me since Sunday to talk and my husband thinks I should hear them out. One of my siblings is mad at me because now their kids are all upset because they believed me when I called out our parents favoring Monica and Jill. Now their kids and mine don't want to go over to my parents' house which is ruining New Year's for them because our parents were going to watch any of the kids that needed babysitting, and our parents are upset the kids don't want to go over anymore. I was just advocating for my children but AITA for calling my parents out in front of everyone the way I did?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
