It made me not want the ice cream at all anymore. This is the 2nd time he did this when I really craved that ice cream. For me the first bite is just the best experience there is to eating the ice cream. It's that first moment of \"bliss\". Yesterday I craved this ice cream (there was only one left) my boyfriend was like save it for tomorrow since we did have homemade burgers with fries for dinner. I agreed and decided I'd save it for tomorrow. I'm also currently on a weightloss journey I only eat 1.2k-1.5k calories max. My boyfriend is quite supportive of my weightloss journey and just is there for me. I know he means the best for me too. Him eating my ice cream really upset me though. It was the last in the box too. After he took the first bite I didn't want it anymore and he just handed it to me and I handed it back. He then just put it flat on his desk. And then he put it on my pillow (I was sitting on the bed upset with the pillow on my lap). I ended up just feeling upset and tears fell out of my eyes. I ended up throwing the ice cream away without eating it anymore since it just really ruined the experience for me. Currently we are also playing a game called Undertale (him playing, me watching) and I'm just not in the mood anymore to finish it due to feeling upset. At this moment he is playing the game by himself while I am typing this Reddit post. He also laughed at me for crying. I do feel pathetic for crying aswell but it genuinely just triggered me. The first time he did this to me he atleast gave me the first bite of his ice cream to make up for it but this time he took the first bite of his own on purpose after he took my first bite.", "created_utc": 1682117373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ulhmy/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bf_to_touch_me_after_he/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And he had his own ice cream.  There was no reason to take a bite from yours.  Yet he did it on purpose.  Apparently everyone saying Y T A missed that.  He can eat his own damn food.  Taking yours is disrespectful, and doing it intentionally just makes him an asshole.", "NTA. Yes, it is just ice cream. So obviously the crying is about more than just ice cream. It is about your boyfriends shitty behavior. Laughing at you when you break down? It sounds as though he likes to torment you. I hate to imagine what that manner of behavior can escalate to\u2026even if it doesn\u2019t escalate, say it just continues -it\u2019s not kind. And isn\u2019t kindness one of the most important things in a partner?", "Get away from this guy. He's showing you exactly who he is, and you deserve better.  He did this once before and you didn't think it was funny then and this time around he upped the ante. Plus he knows you're on a restricted calorie diet which frankly means you're exhausted and on edge and that this treat was extra special to you.

There is no way in fucking hell that I\u2019m sitting there crying and my boyfriend is laughing at me. I don\u2019t even usually tell ppl what to do with their own relationships but what he does to you is really cruel and mean. It\u2019s simply him being mean to you and I don\u2019t like that, not for you and not for anyone. I don\u2019t like to share straws much less have you bite my ice cream with saliva all over it and then you hand it to me. If he wanted A piece he could\u2019ve cut it in half with a knife. Or go out and get a whole new box. Girl the fact that you threw it in the trash and started crying after thinking about it since yesterday just to have him so meanly open it and take a bite out of it is really mean. It\u2019s not insensitive, it\u2019s not a misunderstanding. I straight up think he\u2019s mean to you and that not ok. It\u2019s great that he\u2019s supporting you in your weight loss journey but knowing how you\u2019re already limiting yourself and keeping an eye on your diet that one thing you wanted was that ice cream and he took that reward from you. Now I\u2019m just pissed.", "Some stuff is not what I want to share. Frankly if this had stressed me out, I would have tossed it and gotten another later. And him putting it on my pillow would really have pissed me off because he was not being comforting at all. I am no crier.

Especially food they waited an extra day to eat.\n\nNo one gets first bite except the person it belongs to.", "NTA! I just don't understand why people have such a hard time understanding that not everyone wants your saliva on their things. I don't share food that goes in your mouth. You want some I can cut you a piece and you can eat it with your hands or your spoon. I don't care of we're intimate. It's a boundary. Not to mention, ask me. Don't just take. I don't care who you are. Ask first. Don't put your lips on my straw, don't backwash my soda, and don't lick my damn ice cream. It's not cute, it's rude. \n\nIn your situation, i get accountability in weight loss, but don't put your boyfriend in charge of that. Find a friend and be accountable to them. It switches the power dynamic, and you end up crying about something that seems silly, when it's about other stuff. Also tell him. Don't cry and pout. Specifically say don't bite my things without asking first. Use your words, and stick up for yourself. If you're willing to share the second or third bite or whatever, that's when y'all can discuss that.. or he can get his own, because those things really aren't that big. Him laughing while you are upset is bullshit though, and that needs a discussion also. Doesn't matter of he deems it silly, it's uncaring.", "OP, this has nothing to do with ice cream and everything to do with control and manipulation tactics to push your boundaries.

He knew it would ruin it for you-- he has done this before.  He did it on purpose.\n\nIt's a small cruelty, but a cruelty all the same.\n\nI think if you really look at this relationship you will find other instances like this, and you might find that they have been increasing over time.

In his defense there, if he is like me, he may just laugh at inappropriate moments or at times where he just doesn't understand wtf is going on. Doesn't make it right, but some of us just suck in that department.\n\nI will say unless you are incredibly sensitive, I can't imagine anyone crying crocodile tears over this.

He shouldn't have done it and laughing at you when you're crying is very alarming.

Your boyfriend is a bully, and whatever reason you're crying for, he shouldn't be laughing at you for it. I would strongly reconsider this relationship.\n\nYou may want to reconsider your diet, as well. An adult eating 1,200 calories a day is starvation rations.

We would share a bite of each other's food if we each had something different to try. But he was taking like HUGE bites, like almost 1/3 of those cheap dollar menu sandwiches. Like you, I just cried one time as I felt like he was forcing me to always be hungry or like he thought he deserved food more than me.\n\nHe didn't laugh when I cried, but he was pretty cavalier about it before, and I think that made it worse for me. He had no idea I was feeling so negatively and he thought he was just being silly to make me laugh.\n\nThe difference is, as soon as I cried he was immediately concerned and helped me identify what was bothering me.
