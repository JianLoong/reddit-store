She\u2019s only able to understand the world through the lenses of what she sees now. Arguing is only frustrating (and pointless) for everyone.", "NTA. There are studies on this. Elders with dementia are happier and live with less stress if the people around them accept the reality they're experiencing as Real Enough. \n\nGood job.", "NTA and the good news is you actually have the backing of the medical community on your side. It's actually recommended to kind of just go along with dementia or Alzheimers patients like that because disagreeing can cause them a lot of distress (imagine being told your spouse has been dead for 10 years when you think they are gonna walk in the door) which can in turn cause combative behavior and negative health outcomes. \n\n[https://www.alzsd.org/dos-and-donts-of-compassionate-communication-dementia/](https://www.alzsd.org/dos-and-donts-of-compassionate-communication-dementia/)\n\n[https://www.usagainstalzheimers.org/blog/5-things-never-say-person-alzheimers](https://www.usagainstalzheimers.org/blog/5-things-never-say-person-alzheimers)\n\nI'm sorry your family is going through this, this stuff is really hard.", "NTA. Actually, for patients with dementia it's recommended that you live in their world rather than trying to bring them back to the real world. You might bring them to the real world for a moment or two, but at what cost. You got her off the bathroom floor. That was the goal. It doesn't help anybody to argue with her about Anna being gone.", "Nta. It can be traumatizing for someone with dementia to be told that they are wrong. Imagine expecting Anna to come visit and being told she's dead.", "NTA. \n\nYou are doing the right thing and your aunt (and other family) is completely wrong. Nothing whatsoever can be achieved by trying to \u201cpull people out of\u201d their dementia, except distressing them which is awful for them (and for everyone around). \n\nYour kindness and compassion is really lovely to hear about. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing. \n\nIf your grandma can\u2019t be cared for properly by her family then someone needs to look at other options (eg home help, care facility).", "NTA. Even doctors will tell you, sometimes you just have to agree with them\u2026", "NTA. You sound like a loving caring grandkid.\n\nMy grandpa had dementia. Sometimes you just have to go along with whatever they think is reality. You got her safely into her bed and calmed down the situation.", "NTA - my grandma had dementia and it\u2019s a pin in the arse of an illness. She used to cry saying she was waiting for her mam to come home all the time and at first people would remind her that her mothers dead but obviously that made her cry more. There was other things like that where we all just ended up going along with it. When caring for someone with dementia you need to make it as easy on yourself and the person with dementia as possible. Genuinely, if it makes your life easier and them happier then there should not be an issue.", "NTA with dementia the best course of direction is to agree and/or deflect. So your response was perfect. \"Well if Anna is coming let's get you ready for her\". \n\nIt sounds like her dementia is severe enough that she's not going to just sit and wait all day for something that's not going to happen because she's just going to get confused or forget and convince herself something else is going on anyway. So it makes no difference if you say Anna is or isn't coming because she's not going to remember either way; it's just going to make her argumentative and/or upset when you try to correct her.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, dementia is an absolutely horrible disease", "NTA I worked for an Alzheimer\u2019s care unit, and you\u2019re doing exactly the right thing. Correcting Alzheimer\u2019s patients tends to upset and agitate them. Best practice is to go along with whatever they say. There\u2019s no harm, and it keeps them from getting upset.\n\nIn short, your aunt, cousin, and dad are entirely wrong.", "Nta. I've just cared for my grandfather who has alzhemiers, this is exactly what I do. My nan has early stage alzheimers now and I do the same for her. It does no good to stress them out arguing or making them feel stupid when they realize they've made a mistake.", "NTA. Agreeing with her on things like Anna is coming doesn\u2019t matter. She won\u2019t remember it in the near future. Harping at her and telling her she is wrong is cruel. You did good with her.", "NTA. They probably see it as a sign of disrespect, as you are not treating her like a competent person. Unfortunately she isn\u2019t, so you are behaving very appropriately. They may be struggling to accept that there won\u2019t likely be any more lucid moments.", "Agreeing with the person with dementia (rather - using their reference points for people and events, even when are wrong) is the correct approach! Trying to correct them causes them confusion and frustration, and is all-around detrimental.\n\nNTA , you did the correct thing!", "I worked with people with dementia. You either agree with them or try to distract them. \u201cCorrecting\u201d then can be very upsetting.  Imagine finding out your husband died, over and over, for example.", "NTA and there is no point in arguing with someone with dementia.  I was told this by a home care worker who was checking up on my mother with Alzheimer's.  My mom would talk about how my dad ran off with another woman.  He had died.  :(  I was there for the funeral because I live across the country.  Anyway, I found what she said about my dad upsetting and argued with her.  I just upset her for no reason, because even if you convince the person with dementia of the truth, five minutes later it's like the conversation never happened.  Your approach is more right than the people who think you are wrong.  And you obviously had more success in dealing with her.  Bless her heart.  She can't help it and you are a good granddaughter.", "NTA that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. Just agree and redirect if needed. People with dementia can get very upset if you disagree and tell them the truth. It\u2019s can be very upsetting for them.", "Retired RN here. I used to tell my confused patients \"Mrs X I just did a load of laundry and I'm too busy to fold it, can you help me please?\" They would happily fold a pile of clean towels and wash cloths, when they were done, I'd \"put them away\" and come back with another load.", "NTA My great aunt had dementia, she would ask about people that were long gone. It was awesome because I could tell her how great everyone was doing. I got to give her only good news and all was right in the world, it always made her happy. She\u2019d ask about the same people 10 minutes later, but it was great to alway make her day brighter.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing. Arguing with grandma while she is on the floor is not only counterproductive but potentially dangerous for someone her age. You got grandma up off the floor and safely into bed. \n\nYour family is experiencing the long goodbye. They are already mourning because they are already losing her bit by bit and want more than anything for her to remember. After the dust settles tell your family how much you enjoyed her stories even if you played multiple family members. Grandma knows you belong to her even if she isn\u2019t sure where in her family you belong.", "Nta. You are doing exactly what you should. Tell your aunt to speak with your grandmother's doctor about the best way to respond or to check with experts.", "NTA. You\u2019re treating her with love and respect. You\u2019re honouring her dignity. Kudos to you for such kind treatment.", "You handled the situation very well! Your Aunt unfortunately does not have the best strategy and is probably adding to everyone\u2019s stress including her own. Cut her some slack though bc it is beyond exhausting being a full time caregiver to someone w dementia.", "NTA - it is KIND to do this. Your grandma doesn't need to hear over and over again that the people she loves are dead. Let her float in time and be happy. \n\nI understand your aunt; she's fighting the knowledge that she's lost the mother she knew for good. But that's what's happened.  Be nice to your aunt, though. It's hard yakka to look after someone with dementia. Try to give her breaks when you can.", "NTA\n\n\nYou handled the bathroom situation wonderfully! As some other commenters mentioned, it's often recommended to do so.\n\n\nMaybe aunt and other fam members have some underlying difficulty accepting grandma's situation, but unfortunately that's how it is.

Every day I am at least 10 different residents daughter, and you go with it. She needs care from people who actually know what they are doing, who are properly educated and trained to work with those who have dementia. You need to contact your grandmothers social worker and request regular welfare checks be done on your gran. \n\nThe fact that she fell, and the ONLY person able to pick her up was you, is a major issue. How long has she laid on the floor in the past because your aunt is not properly trained and because your male family members can't handle the fact that women have bodies, and how long in the future? This does need to be reported and do not feel bad even for a moment. Will your aunts frustration turn to abuse? Has it already?
