Apparently this site was fairly popular with her classmates and she felt like she was excluded if she didn\u2019t have their products so she decided to just order from them. I noticed because one package got delivered with my name on it but i haven\u2019t ordered anything. When I opened the package i already saw it was some pink stuff and clearly not for me so i went up to her room and confronted her. She couldn\u2019t explain to me how she got the money since my credit card wasn\u2019t charged.\n\nAs a punishment i obviously tried to cancel the order and took her phone from her. She pleaded to not do it but would refuse to tell me where she got the money saying over and over again that it was not stolen so my suspicion grew. \n\nSo the next day i wrote the company an email and waited for them to answer. But since my suspicion grew more and more i decided to see if i could find something on her phone. Now for some context before i explain what i found i have to tell you that i am a single father, her mother and my wife dyed when she was only 2 years old from a car accident. So she was too young to remember her and i was practically the only parent and family she had. \n\nBack to the story: as i went through her phone i discovered something on instagram, she actually messaged this company on instagram a couple of times asking for a certain product that was sold out for a long time, but all of a sudden they replied with something along the lines of \u201cthe product you really wished for is back in stock, you can purchase it now if you want to?\u201d And i thought that was it. But no, the next part gave me a real heart ache. My daughter answered them with \u201coh no sorry, i actually can\u2019t afford it and my dad can\u2019t either, i never get nice things since we dont have that kind of money, but thanks for answering anyways\u201d i felt like my world crumbled. I never realised that she felt that way. Yes she doesn\u2019t have a lot of things but i always made sure she had clothes, food and a shower. \n\nThe shocking part was when the customer service answered her and they full on talked about it. And all of a sudden they sent her a 100$ gift card. I was shocked and couldn\u2019t believe a company would care less. But also is what i can offer her that terrible that she would go and beg an online store for free products? How do i approach this? Should i let her keep these things? Do i thank the company? \n\nIdk what to do but AITA for how i reacted?", "created_utc": 1670284751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdotbl/aita_for_cancelling_my_daughters_order/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have a heart to heart with her.", "NAH.\n\nYour daughter deciding she *just has to* have the latest trendy thing that is popular with her classmates is classic teenage behavior, and I have to say in her defense that it's not *wrong* to like and want things that happen to be trendy and popular. You're not a bad parent for *not being able to provide expensive things,* but you also shouldn't take her desire for such things is some kind of personal betrayal or backhanded attack on you.\n\nAnd yes, companies \\*do\\* in fact sometimes just gift people things; it's partly kindness and partly just good grassroots PR. That's not suspicious in and of itself, and *having satisfied your suspicion that the items were illicitly acquired,* you should let your daughter keep them since she did nothing wrong to obtain them.", "NTA.  Your minor child was ordering products and you wanted to know how she was actually paying for them.  That's called parenting.\n\nAlso, she's not \"begging\" stores to give her items.  They let her know the item she wanted is in stock and she said, \"Sorry, I don't have money and my dad can't afford it.\"  They chose to give her a gift card.  Take this with a grain assault, but you're making a mountain out of a mold bill.", "Well, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one to look up the store. You just gave them more than $100 worth of promotion because people love a store with a heart. Give your daughter back the stuff, but tell her to talk to you before she does that again. Every teen wants to fit in, so I get why she did it, but explain why she shouldn\u2019t do it again. Perhaps she can babysit or tutor younger kids in order to earn her spending money. NAH", "NAH - You had every right to be worried and to dig into this matter.  Your daughter wasn't being forthcoming and she's only 14.  However, that's a very, very difficult time for kids and sometimes \"fitting in\" feels like the most important thing in the world to them.  I'm sure she didn't want you to feel guilty about not being able to give her the extras and frankly I'm surprised myself that the company did something this nice.  Given that this was essentially a gift from them, I'd recommend letting her keep the items, but have a serious talk with her about your financial situation and maybe work with her to see if there's a way she can earn some money of her own to spend.  She is in no way too young to start learning financial responsibility and this could actually be a chance for the two of you to strengthen your bond while you teach her things that will be of great value to her in the future.", "I wonder if this is an ad.", "NAH My guy. You have every right to be suspicious of how your, minor, daughter managed to pay for an order like that. \n\nBut she probably didn't want to explain to you about the gift card. Cause she didn't want to make you feel guilty about her not \"getting nice things\".", "NAH. You did your duty as a father to figure out where the money came from.  I think maybe you should rethink your punishments, and apologize to her for embarrassing her, but I would want to know if my 14 year old randomly came into possession of $100", "NAH. Talk to your daughter. The company did a good thing. You have done the best you can and your daughter is probably too young to completely understand everything financially. Make sure you give her the tools she needs to do well in life.", " Hm. NTA there are things you couldn\u2019t have known but didn\u2019t handle particularly well. I don\u2019t know that I would have assumed any different though. I would try to reach out to the company with gratitude and explain, see if they will uncancel the order. There\u2019s no harm in trying and explaining an honest misunderstanding. \n\nAs for your daughter, apologize to her. Our kids know our secrets. And she\u2019s not that young. She knows where she stands socioeconomically, and that\u2019s ok. School basically makes sure you do. It doesn\u2019t need to be a source of shame, and your shame if you feel it shouldn\u2019t be her shame. Being from a modest home is ok. You have love and you have each other. And maybe some kawaii stuff too.", "NAH. You need to have a conversation with your daughter about why she feels you do not have money to buy her things. Money might be tight, but it sounds like you were unaware of the money she would need to buy the things she wants. It is normal at her age to start wanting to purchase increasingly more expensive things. Perhaps you can give her a budget of money she can use each month (increase her allowance according to your abilities). Also, consider that at 14 she\u2019s old enough to start working some types of part time work, which would allow her to make her own spending money. That\u2019s how I did it through my teens starting at 14. Do not approach this with anger though, approach it as you reconnecting with where your daughter is now and accepting that she\u2019s growing up and has changes in needs and interests.", "YTA. My biggest concern is that she didn't trust you enough to tell you the truth, maybe because she was worried you would react like this.\n\n The company gave the gift card to her. What does it harm in letting her keep it?  I believe that sometimes people need kindness and sometimes they can give it. \n\nIf it were me, i would sit my daughter down and say \"This is a really kind thing that the company did for you. I hope you said thank you, and when you can do kind things for other people you should always pay it forward.\"\n\nI might add that she should be careful about what she posts on the internet. But you're putting this story up on publicly-accessible Reddit, so i really don't think you have the right to criticize her here.\n\nEdit: btw, you're NTA for figuring out where this came from. You had to do that because we all know there are some really sketchy people. But you should work on building trust with your daughter going forward.", "YTA\n\nWhy did you automatically jump to your kid stealing? Why would she feel the need to hide it from you unless she knows you'd react badly and make her feel awful? \nAlso jesus you sound like you have really fragile ego with your parenting.\n\n\"But also is what i can offer her that terrible that she would go and beg an online store for free products?\"\n\nThis is exactly the type of thing what my mother said to me when I was a kid and now we barely have a relationship.\n\nThis is the kind of mentality that will drive her away from you when she's older.", "YTA for canceling the order. \n\nFirst off she didn't beg for shit. She reached out to the company who was kind enough to give her some free products. I personally have been given free products by Anker before. \n\nAlso she's 14, which means being cool and fitting in and being accepted with her peer group is very important to her. \n\nAlso you are a huge asshole for violating her privacy like that. In fact going through her phone is the worst part of this whole thing. \n\nShe is 14 she deserves privacy. \n\nYes I'm sure seeing \"we can't afford it\" hurt you because you are a single dad trying to do your best. But she's also a 14 year old wanting to fit in with her social circle and seemed to be resourceful. You should be rewarding her, not punishing her. \n\nShit, I know a couple *ugh* \"influencers\" on IG who get free products sent to them. Just to wear them in their posts and give free advertisement. It's win win. \n\nCompany gets free advertisement, company undoubtedly gets to write off this donation, and your daughter gets to fit in with her peers. There is literally no downside to this \n\nI think we both know what you are going to get her for Christmas this year.", "That looks like an add in disguise.... And what store send gift card to people out of the blue... And why wouldn't she tell you if it's a gift card that she won it. Nothing makes sense here, except that you really had to share this link and tell us how good they are ...", "YTA\n\nYour daughter doesn't trust you enough to tell you she won a gift card. Clearly you are doing it wrong.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I would be totally freaked out if my teenage daughter started getting merchandise shipped to her and refused to tell me how she made the purchase. I doubt she was keeping the generous gift card info from you to protect your 'feelings', more likely because she thought she might be in trouble about it somehow. As her parent, you were absolutely right to go through her phone to figure out what she was not telling you.  I would have a long talk about 'why' she wouldn't tell you tho, and point out that all this drama would have been cleared up instantly if she had been up front about the gift card in the first place.  Of course she should keep these things, the company meant for her to have them.", "NTA, having her own non stolen money at 14 is definitely potentially dangerous enough to be worth prying over ... but try not to be mad that she had a hard time admitting she vented into the customer service chatline, every teen opens up at a weird time at least once & I'd just be glad it was this instead of during a presentation in class or something", "Nta. Let it go. Keep communicating with your daughter. Now you know where to go for a Christmas gift for her.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think she actually feels that way. She\u2019s being a typical teen and manipulating to get what she wants for free. I get the same kind of messages from kids with my online store.", "YTA. She got the money for the products through perfectly legitimate means. It was her money and you had no right to cancel her order or treat her like a criminal before you knew anything. You owe her an apology.", "NTA.  It\u2019s understandable that your daughter would feel left out, but that would be a reason to order, like, ONE thing, not beg the site to give her $100 worth of stuff for free.", "YTA. It's close though.\n\nYour motivations are pure. Your daughter receiving random gifts via social media is 100% an alarming.\n\nHowever, she's 14 and taking her phone to invade her privacy is the nuclear option and one that she'll learn to circumvent in the future. \n\nTalk to her about how this situation made you feel and use it as a trust building opportunity. Also, give her the stuff back, unless she's straight up scamming them, which doesn't sound like the case from your description.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I never realised that she felt that way. Yes she doesn\u2019t have a lot of things but i always made sure she had clothes, food and a shower.\n\nDoesn't seem like she lied at all. And certainly, the dad isn't mad about it. She didn't lie to her dad, she refused to answer. She told the truth: she didn't steal the money. She was thoughtful enough to keep the circumstance to herself because she knew he would feel awful.", "She didn\u2019t lie at all, but i would prefer her not to give any information about her out to the public", "[removed]", "Plenty of families can. \n\nOP can't. He already admitted it", "I never looked into her phone before and don\u2019t plan to do it again, but when all of a sudden products come through the mail with magic money and no answer you do get worried that she did commit some crimes you know?", "You don\u2019t see the problem with your statement, so I\u2019ll mansplain: he didn\u2019t KNOW that it was a gift card from that company UNTIL he looked into it and found the answers that his daughter was not giving when he asked her.", "In what world would a company want to be associated with a daughter basically begging for money, hiding it and lying to her father?\u2026! Also who would be awake at 3 AM just to advertise for a company?..", "I am from Switzerland not japan?", "You're on the AITA sub and going after OP for something that is clearly a reach and unrelated. \n\nyta", "Saying no to her having something won't destroy your relationship. It's called parenting. I don't think you should let her have that stuff anyway. They website could be anyone. A decent website wouldn't give a child money to order stuff anyway. You should also teach her not to give her address or family details out online", "How is that making fun of a 14 year old. Stop trying to twist what people say you are terrible at it. They need to hire better advertisers there", "Really? Because this 14yo did this from her own freaking phone. So you think she paid for the device? Pays the phone bill? Sounds like they CAN afford it, but it's a random luxury she doesn't need.", "She was HOUNDING this company for a long time. So you think her situation was somehow different in the beginning? Or was she always inquiring about this specific product without ever having an intention to pay? I just can't get past this 14yo having her own phone and acting like she's had to go without.", "Did she buy her phone? Who pays the phone bill?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Selling weed at school? \n\nOk now she has cash from selling \n\nHow does she convert that cash to an online payment? \n\nNext time she will just lie and say one of her friends bought it for her. That's what you are gonna make her do.", "Exactly", "Ah so he impulsively made a decision without having all the facts? \n\nHe just taught his daughter to lie to him. Next time she will say a friend got it or ship it to a friend's house", "Stop feeding the troll, if he want's to belive is an ad, a lie or the next superfriends movie just let it.", "Its an advert. Or a dodgy website", "Thank you, this crazy person is harassing me all they can.. i am really down and try to see the positive but its really hard with someone trying to dismiss me or my daughter.", "I didnt tell her no, she just ordered it without my consent not telling me. Honestly i thought she stole a credit card since she wouldn\u2019t tell me where she got that money from. She doesn\u2019t talk to me because i took her phone and package and people tell me its fine to give it back but i dont know how to adress it with her to not lie or hide things from me and talk to strangers about her life online with all her pictures and name", "Because you literally dismiss our situation? Very low of you buddy..", "The phone was a gift from the neighbour. It an old used phone she didn\u2019t need anymore, for the service we have the cheapest one so he can still contact me anytime something happens. And yes she does get presents on birthdays and christmas, but nothing too fancy since i can only leave out meals for a couple of days so i can still function", "She wasn't hounding them a long time. \n\nWhy are you lying? \n\nMost 14 year olds I know have their own phone. She wanted some products her friends have, and the company decided to gift her some. What's the issue?", "Uhh how does having her own phone have to do with shit? I see homeless people with phones but I guess they are so \"privileged\" to have a phone they don't need other things. Your comments are laughable and I hope OP doesn't take anything you say to heart.", "OP has already said they can't afford what she wanted. \n\nFor all you know she has a nine year old phone. \n\nJust stop dude", "Your logic doesn\u2019t hold. He\u2019s a parent, she\u2019s a minor. She had access to money that he didn\u2019t know about, and when he asked her she didn\u2019t want to tell him.", "She was already refusing to tell him where the money came from, so I don\u2019t see how this is going to make a difference. He didn\u2019t make the decision impulsively, and he didn\u2019t have the facts because she wouldn\u2019t tell him. So of course he made this decision so he could *get* the facts.", "No if she is this secretive do nit give them back. She could be talking to anyone on line. That website could be grooming her! Honestly what kind if site gives money to kids! And they have her address too! I would be worried. Contact authorities. She is clearly easily manipulated god know what they will get her to do for free stuff next. It's very concerning... if its not an ad that is", "What's your situation again? Your daughter getting free stuff she really wants? Nightmare", "Do you think parents can always afford to buy their kids random toys or memorabilia or whatever? Do you think birthdays are special to children because of the cake and party hats?", "Probably because she knew he'd act like this lmao. \n\nHow guess what happens next time? \n\nShe lies and ships it to her friends house instead", "She didn't lie though. \n\nNow she will. \n\nAnd yes he did. He immediately went to cancel the order. \n\nIn which case her illegal funds would have been refunded to her lmao. \n\nShe he didn't actually do anything to fix the problem, which didn't exist anyway.", "What? I know what you are doing but id be concerned that this is even more disrespectful.. i can tell you are still a kid yourself desperately trying to proof you are right. Please dont bother to comment any further if you do not want to engage in finding solutions rather than disrespecting me or my daughter..", "Can\u2019t you read? Are you new to reddit?", "Depends on the family. \n\nSome families yes. Some no. \n\nBirthdays are special because it's the day you came onto this planet and it is a party for you. Presents or not. \n\nWhy are you acting like this? OP literally said he couldn't afford it. \n\nHE LITERALLY SAID THAT.", "Yo why is this so important to you", "I didnt cancel it yet, i was about to do it after a day of thinking what to do if she doesn\u2019t tell me. But i already stated that you can read it again if you want.", "See if this was really you would be genuinely scared for her right now. I would be too. Because those are real concerns for children online. She shouldn't be giving away details about how she's a vulnerable girl with only one parent. Giving away her address to strangers.", "We all know if this wasn't an add you would have ignored these comments and went to the ones talking about your horrendous situation. The fact that you are denying it so vehemently only makes it more suspicious.  Anyway it's genuinely 3am where I am so I'm off to bed. Good luck with the advertising!", "It just angers me that people like you try to dismiss a situation like this. I did answer most of the comments. Also it is also 03:00 here."]}
