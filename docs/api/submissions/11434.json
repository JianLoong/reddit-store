We have remained very close and she and I don't follow a strict parenting plan. We do our best to have the kids see us both as much as possible. We celebrate every birthday, every Christmas together, and we show up to support our kids together as much as we can make work with our jobs. Our families are also still very tight. The kids love it. Sometimes it will be my parenting time but they want Thora and so they spend that day with her, or vice versa. Works so well for the kids.\n\nThora married Michael in November 2021. He and I got along in the beginning. He clearly loved Thora and was great with the kids, which is what Thora and I cared most about. But then this past summer some things changed with Michael. An example is Indie was singing and playing an instrument at this little talent show his summer camp set up. Thora and I both went, so did Michael, who took the day off work. Michael did not look happy to see me and once Thora was not within earshot or sightline, he was visibly tense and I swear he groaned at some point near me. Then Thora had to go out of state to see a friend of hers who was very sick. The kids chose to stay with me and I don't believe Michael was happy about that. I tried to ask him about it but he swore things were fine.\n\nIn November Indie and Colbie had a busy month with different stand out things within extra curricular's and school. I was lucky enough to attend 9/10 of them with Thora attending 8/10. Michael got to attend 3/10. All three were ones I could attend and it felt very much like he didn't want me there. \n\nLate last month when Michael and I were the ones attending a school function for the kids that he asked me to show up to less of the kids events and let him and Thora do some of that stuff with the kids as a family. I told him they already do. He said not when I'm around. That I am getting in the way of him being a parental figure for the kids. I told him he was a parental figure and the kids love him. He said they will never consider us equal until they see him instead of me at some of these events. He said it's important for the more \"stable family unit of four\". I told him I was not willing to miss the kids events. He did not take it well and accused me of interfering and alienating their chances of a family unit. He texted me after the event with things he wanted me to miss (including Indie's Elementary school graduation in May). I told him it was not happening. He told me Thora wanted this too.\n\nThora knew nothing of this and told me the kids would be so upset if we did what Michael wanted, which I knew also. She was angry at Michael. Michael is angry at me still. He called me an asshole. I don't want to believe I'm an asshole but I know this is not the norm for every divorced parents situation and it makes me ask if I am TA for not letting them have some of those events just them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677926386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hwbd6/aita_for_refusing_to_miss_some_of_my_kids_events/", "score": 8340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Part of me can't even believe I am posting this but my reason for posting, and my reason for asking, is I know how uncommon this is for people. I also know while my kids love Michael. They in no way see him the same as their mom and I. I know Michael has been so good with my kids and that he might be feeling jealous. Perhaps I was too quick to reject it. I question if I should have worked with him in some way or handled this whole thing better. My desire to be there for my kids was all I could think about. But maybe I handled it poorly and was unfair to Michael. An asshole even. Maybe it's also unfair to the kids.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t envy stepparents, i know it\u2019s gotta be hard. I have a stepmom, she\u2019s been with my dad for at least 26 years. My parents divorced when i was 10 and we lived with my dad. She moved in when we were teens. It was very rough at first, and to be honest she was not\ngood to my older sister at all.

Thora and you are Mom and Dad and that will never change.  I would be grateful that he loves Thora and the kids bc the more love in their lives, the better.  He can join the parenting team, but he will not supplant you are the kids' Dad.  He needs to learn how to co-parent.  It is good for the kids to see everyone getting along.

And the new husband's reaction makes me concerned for your children. Any person that's trying to isloate children from bio-parents are doing that for a reason and intentions are probably not good. I would check in on the kids more often tbh. He is  insecure and controlling and putting his irrational feelings before the wellbeing of the children. He knew the family dynamic he was getting into when he got married. And honestly the kids will never see him as \"equal\", him marrying their mother should not replace you as their father. My goodness this man gets on my nerves. Don't communicate with him anymore, talk to your ex wife and continue to support your children.", "NTA on any level.  Michael is the one trying to alienate the children from you and assume the father role full time.  He is slowly trying to undermine the wonderful setup that you and Thora have for the children.

The fact that you and Thora have such a good co-parenting relationship AND the fact that Michael started out interacting positively with you are really good starting points.\n2. The fact that Michael is focused on being 'equal' with you is a very yellow flag. The fact that he lied about Thora also wanting you to stay away is a red flag.\n3. I guess I'd start with two key considerations: (1) Is there some piece of what Michael wants that IS (or could be tweaked to be) reasonable? and (2) How do the kids feel about time with Michael?\n4. Him asking you not to show up for you daughter's elementary graduation is out of the question. But are there some practices you all have that are maybe heavier on the 'we are still all together focus' than they have to be? Some examples: Does it end up that there never any weekends when Michael, Thora and the kids get to do something fun/special on their own? Is every holiday all about the kids seeing both your side and Thora's side of the family and never Michaels? I could see how that could be very frustrating for him.\n5. While you/Thora, Thora/Michael consider some tweaks to family plans that the kids and you all are good with, maybe Thora can ask Michael to do some counseling. The best step-parent anecdotes I read here are about the step-parents who embrace whatever level of relationship suits the kids' needs (whether it is more like another parent or like just a safe, friendly adult). The thing is, it's up to Michael to refocus his priorities from competing with you to accepting what works best for the kids.\n6. It is possible for Michael to need to reframe his perspective AND for him to have a legitimate frustration that there's almost no time for the four of them to be a family without you present. It is possible (just possible) for the kids to be happy to have you and Thora together at everything and also possible that they would also be happy spending a Thanksgiving or Memorial Day weekend with Michael's family and catching your family at the next holiday. (If not that, maybe something else.)\n7. I think there's a good chance that Michael's just a temporary ahole here and that you three adults have what it takes to repair this glitch in the family dynamics. I am very hopeful that all will do just that. Good wishes to you and the whole family.", "NTA...

So I\u2019d really urge you to start from a place of compassion and reason with Michael. Yes, it\u2019s on Thora to try to manage him, but keeping a conversation open with the three of you is probably the best way to handle this initially. This guy obviously really loves your children, which you\u2019re obviously grateful for. You can de-escalate the situation, or at least try and that\u2019s probably a good first step versus playing tit for tat and getting worked up and excluding him causing turmoil and tension around the adults. It\u2019s not a good space for the kids to be in and especially don\u2019t want them to feel like they have to choose who to love. He\u2019s definitely completely wrong and a jerk, but try understanding that it\u2019s coming from a place of love and insecurity.

You are their dad, and sounds like a great dad, and have clocked more years in their lives. He basically won\u2019t be able to catch up to that. Unless some real bad behavior goes down on your part, they will always feel more comfortable and safer with you than they will with him. That is just the effects of time and the early formative years. He is the stepdad, and needs to realize that he is an addition to the family and how to be a good one. \n\nHe has to accept that it is not a family unit of four. It almost sounds like he is trying to replace you on some level. You guys have a kind of rare setup where the divorced parents get along fine and are there for the kids.

It will not work out well for him.", "NTA,you're their father,f his bs", "Did he want kids of his own? We're they planning to have any?

Don't give in on this.", "NTA. You and Michael are not equal to the kids, and that is appropriate. It is alarming that he would expect otherwise. He sounds a bit unhinged and like he needs help accepting that your kids already have a father. Your role as their father does not diminish his role as a step-parent, but he is way out of line actively trying to diminish your role and edge you out of your own kids\u2019 lives. Personally, I would not take such a threat lightly at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, both of you going to the same events is by definition more equal in the eyes of the kids as one person showing up to events the other misses. Such a system is obviously not equal. He is pushing for such a scheme because what he really wants is for your kids to love you less and feel less close to you and that you are less dependable.

I now also wonder if there were some specific moment where he felt slighted/in the backseat at a 'big' event that he has allowed to get under his skin and fester. Of course, it is also possible this was the perspective he had all along; it just begs the question of why the change now.\n\nI still believe that the best chance for a positive resolution is a combination of counseling and an open-minded reconsideration of any possible tweaks that could be positive for all involved.", "She is a kick ass mom.

Michael isn't the parent, and he needs to accept that. It's ridiculous that he's saying OP needs to be at fewer events so the kids can see Michael as equal. No, he is inherently not going to be equal in the eyes of the kids. No matter how awesome he is, it's normal for kids to gravitate more toward their biological parents than step parents.

I think it'd be beneficial for you to validate his feelings, and discuss how he views the future of this unit, where you fit in, and how that impacts the children. Not saying that you appease his requests, mostly so that he feels seen. But always bring it back to the kids, and how this will impact their lives. Make it clear that they have room in their lives to include ~~you~~ (edit:Michael), but your current system is very effective and healthy, and it's not worth jeopardizing for. If he loves your kids as another parent, he will need to find a way to fit in under these circumstances.\n\nBuild Michael up when with your kids; things like \"all three of us are so proud of you!\" or recognize and praise a more private accomplishment like if Michael helped with a school assignment.

Speaking as someone who grew up with some complicated stuff around the men in my mother's life after my parents got divorced, I think your kids are so lucky in you. Everyone's right - however much it hurts Thora, you need to make sure that complaints of that sort go through her, at the very least so that she knows what's going on. It may seem harsh to make her the go-between because it's obviously stressful, but it prevents any chance of Michael getting more intense about it. I can see him lying to you both to ensure you don't come to events, since he's already started with \"Thora agrees with me\" - like, telling you the kids want him instead of you, or that event dates and times have changed so that you look like a no-show.

She was between 7-12 mental age so she always felt like i got special privileges.\n\nMy step mom is my mom because when i was 6 and i asked her if i should call her mommy now she stopped cooking, looked at me and said she didn't think my mom would like that so her first name was just fine.\n\nlike what this step dad is doing is only going to ensure these kids don't consider him equal.\n\nnote as an adult i seek out the support i need based on the person who is better equipped for it.", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffcTHIS\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffc", "It isn't cute, but pretty sure even with my questionable choices and my ex being understanding, says more than how you interpreted it vs what it was really like. I was just adding context to why fiance would think they hated him.", "Reminds me of what tom felton abd emma watson said about each other recently about working on harry potter\n\nThey apparently always agreed they were soulmates but not romantically. That there was a deep rooted love and understanding between them that they never experienced with anyone else but its at the same time purely plutonic", "Well you two sound fantastic parents. So committed. Well done!\n\nMichael should absolutely not be upsetting the balance here. He needs to butt out!", "Micheal seems like the evil step dad from the movies. The kind that acts sweet in front of wife and step kids , but is secreting plotting to kill the bio dad. It is so out of line for him to expect you to skip big events , just so he can be the only male father figure present there.", "Yes. He wants to be equal to OP with respect to the kids, and he can\u2019t be since they\u2019re OP\u2019s kids. And he wants OP to hurt his kids so that they\u2019ll look to him instead.\n\nThis is seriously messed up. OP and his ex have a happy kid-focused arrangement and Michael is thinking of himself rather than the kids. (Which, in true Wisdom of Solomon fashion, is another reason why he\u2019ll never be OP\u2019s equal as their parent.) Michael needs to want what he can and does have rather than keep pushing for what he can\u2019t; this latter is the most likely thing that will wreck his \u201cfamily unit\u201d.", "u/Ennardinthevents, it's also important for a lot of couples to parent together, as a unified unit, which requires consulting with each other and coming to consensus. Both the parent and the step-parent have authority over the children living in their house. My stepfather was overly strict when I was a teenager. There were times when his decisions would have been unreasonable and might have backfired in teenage rebellion, etc. There were times when my mother overruled him because he was \"not my real father,\" or I said the same thing. I wish I could take those words back. He and my mother have been together since I was 3. My biological father has been mostly out of my life since I was 9, and I went NC with him at 15 - before some of the incidents I'm talking about, even. My stepfather *was* my primary father figure. He was the one who was there for me, who really raised me, and saying he wasn't my real father was just mean. I don't know how long your father and stepmother have been together, and if it's recent, I can see that she's likely much more of a father's wife than a stepmom. I understand that you may prefer your dad's determinations to hers, and that makes it tempting to declare her opinions invalid. It's important that you have continuity of rules and expectations, and your dad should certainly have the ability to decide on his own when he thinks you can safely be allowed to do something, but she does have a certain amount of responsibility for you, too. That means there *are* decisions it's appropriate to consult with her on, too.\n\nu/Dapper-Release-3661, I hope you can see that stories like mine illustrate that your children will never see Michael as their father, even if they were to end up liking him better. By the time they are that age and still have any kind of relationship with you, that ship has already sailed. You are their real father. I think Michael believed he could come into their lives and get a ready-made family, become the dad he always wanted to be, no diaper changing needed! Thora may have come with children as a package deal, but that doesn't mean he has a right to supplant or displace you. Nor does it mean your home as a single dad is not stable. A two-parent household may be \"normal,\" but that doesn't mean a two-parent household is always best, especially when it means depriving a child of a good and loving parent. Michael has to come to terms with his real role - as the bonus, extra parent. He needs to learn that his presence at those events is about demonstrating his feeling for them, not about taking over your role. They can make memories as a four-person family on days that are not your children's milestones. They can go on family trips and outings. He can create traditions like special breakfasts he makes on Saturdays. If you and Thora had a major conflict, he could require certain events to be separate or duplicate - like one parent gets Christmas Eve and one gets Christmas Day, or you swap years hosting the birthday party. He can't tell you not to be there for your children's games, performances, graduations, and other public events.\n\nNTA. At all. Being there for your children is the absolute best thing you can do. No decision you make regarding your daughters should be decided on the basis of Michael's feelings. The decisions should be made on the basis of your children's feelings and your children's needs.\n\nI do wonder if Michael is feeling insecure in his role as husband - like he can't be Thora's #1 man if you have the role of \"dad.\" He needs to get over that stuff if he really wants to be a parent. You need to be sure you talk to her about Michael's demands.\n\nEdited to correct gender.", "Thing is, obviously in reality it isn\u2019t a competition, as you and OP clearly understand. But Michael can still win! But as it isn\u2019t a competition, all he needs to do is define what would be a win for him.\n\nI\u2019m a stepdad, and I\u2019m totally winning. I have a strong, healthy relationship with my boy.\n\nAm I beating his Dad? Who cares? It isn\u2019t a competition!", "I really like your idea of a discussion and how you suggest to frame it. It would also make it clear that they should tell you two if a teacher or counselor stepped over the line or if they were getting bullied.", "Then he and Thora should be taken to court for parental alienation and OP will likely get full custody.", "Lol, I wish I could disagree with this but it tends to be more true than I would like.", "Look man, my father was a piece of absolute shit but was manipulative and I hero worshipped him as a kid. Despite being very worried and concerned, while I was still blinded to the reality of the situation my stepdad *never* behaved in any other way than my *step*dad. Now that I\u2019m an adult I\u2019ve heard how difficult it was for him and my mom, but over everything they kept the peace so that I could grow up in as little turbulent environment as possible. \n\nYour situation is nowhere near as toxic and precarious yet this dude has his panties in a twist, trying to stir up trouble when there is none. You and your ex love your kids, so nip this in the bud before buddy starts down the parental alienation track to get what he wants.", "Then he should have found someone else to marry.", "You know you aren't TA... Why are you even asking? \n\nThis dude is an insecure idiot. He shouldn't even be texting you, his wife/your ex should be doing it. He should go through her if he can't be honest with all parties. He wanted you to lie and then see your kids less. What a D bag", "For this to work OP has to work with Michael.  I get it, Michael is tired of having married into a much bigger relationship with the ex than is usual.  I think that acknowledging his frustration and appreciating his contribution would do more for the long-term success than ignoring him or putting him in \"his\" place.\n\nI don't know how these guys figure this out, but people all make mistakes.  By going behind his wife's back Michael did not handle trying to solve his \"problem\" well, but Michael did not know what to do.  Please do not focus on blame, fault, and mistakes made, but rather on solutions.  There are not a lot of families that have been successful in creating a healthy inclusive stepfamily dynamic.  This is hard.\n\nI urge this father to realize that this is hard on Michael and use this as an opportunity to let Michael know that he is important and appreciated. And then, I don't know.  Good luck.", "Mostly because I question my handling of things and whether I could have done a better job of dealing with this.", "Boo hoo hoo for Michael.  The kids' events are not about him they are about the kids and they want both Mom and Dad there.  OP deserves to be at these events more than Michael does because he is the actual parent.  He knew what he was getting into and agreed to join this family.", "I have an in-law that lies about what other people think or said about situations to try and get people to take their side or guilt people, and ever since I first encountered this, I've never trusted them again. Time has only proven that was the right choice. It's so immature - plain childish - and just gross. Breeds so much dissent between people if they don't the toxic habits of that person, and that with adults. Doing this with children involved is beyond unacceptable and a dealbreaker. \n\nOP: NTA", "Have you expressed any concern to Thora about things he might say to the kids when you aren\u2019t around, or when she isn\u2019t around?", "Now see, I'm not so sure he's such a good man. I think he's a man who was able to \"behave\" a certain way for a while, like he was going along with everything until he couldn't hide it anymore, and when you didn't \"go away\" after Thora married him, he had enough.  I don't think he's been as on-board with this set-up from the beginning as he acted like...he just thought once he came in, you'd back off some, and you didn't play the game the way he thought you would.\n\nPeople who are abusive personalities are great at playing the long game. Biding their time, then a little bit at a time, trying to isolate their would-be victims from the people in their lives.\n\nNo \"good man\" would EVER dream of telling a dad to back off his own kids.", "Nah, nah, nah, you are more than good. I'm an AH and YOU are not. That's an insane ask. You are a good dad and ex husband. He should be grateful.", "NTA. I think Princess-She-Ra was suggesting a therapist because the kids will sense the hostility between you and Michael and between Thora and Michael. Although you and Thora are just fine, the overall family unit is not. It's great that you and Thora have figured out how to do an exceptional job of co-parenting. It's too bad Michael is trying to sabotage that. Don't let him.", "Good. She should be angry, he tried to undermine your relationship with your children for his benefit. It was wrong, it was selfish, and it was not in the best interest of anyone but himself. If I were Thora, I would not want to remain with someone who puts their ego above what\u2019s best for my kids.", "Why is he angry at you? YOU didn't do anything. He lied and got caught. What else is he lying about? And something else to think about. What if this is not about his insecurities, and more about isolating your kids from you for darker reasons? \n\nHave nonstop dialogue with your kids and make sure they know that they should tell you if anything happens at moms house that shouldn't. They also need to be told that you need to be informed if he badmouths you in any way to them. \n\nParental alienation is a thing, and it's not always the other parent that does it.", "I\u2019m not understanding why OP has to tweak a working agreement. It works for them, it works for the kids and it worked for Michael until he decided that since he married their mom he\u2019s now \u201cdad\u201d. He doesn\u2019t get to ask OP to miss anything or take himself out of the equation. Michael is his ex wife\u2019s new husband, not his kids new father.", "You don\u2019t seem to understand that Michael absolutely does not get a say in this.", "What FloMoJoeBlow said!( I love that name )", "Yup. He better fall in line or he's gonna fall out.", "Michael's trying to make him not be present to alienate the kids. I would check in with them to make sure there's no pressure at home from him. NTA", "That\u2019s unreasonable. No parent would agree.", "I wouldn't, not now that Thora has seen the first red flag... Michael told a whopper about her not wanting OP at their child's graduation. I think even Michael knows it won't end well for him if he tries to separate the children from their father in any way.", "You keep on doing what you\u2019re doing. You and Thora have put your childrens needs as the priority. I\u2019m a stepmom to a now almost 29 year old female. I\u2019ve always made it clear to her (she was 19 when we got engaged) that I am not going to be her mother and tell her what to do, as she is an adult. I won\u2019t replace her mother, nor want to. I let her know I will be there for her and I have been a sounding board for her in regards to her telling her dad things that will upset him, but I know my place in her life, and I\u2019ve let her take the lead of what she\u2019s comfortable with. It\u2019s worked out wonderfully for us.", "I\u2019m glad she was. I had a stepdad like him, any mention of my dad, or old boyfriends of mom\u2019s made him blow a gasket \n\nMy dad sucks, but even he wasn\u2019t like that\n\nAnd it was always so benign too, like \u2018Hey remember when Jake took us to Wendy\u2019s that time and they completely messed up our order?\u2019 Made him EXPLODE. How dare mom have other men in her life, even before him?!\n\nThe older I got, I saw how utterly pathetic it was\n\nThankfully, current stepdad is awesome", "I\u2019d probably include if they are told something that isn\u2019t nice about mommy or daddy. Because it might not hurt them if they hear it but it might be good to tell if they hear it", "That is why Thora needs to nip that in the bud very soon.", "That certainly happens, but at the kid's ages and the fact that OP has been a strong presence in their lives to date, they'd likely still end up resenting their stepfather to some degree for the fact that their previous happy arrangement was derailed around the time that he came along, even if they don't connect it to being his fault.", "As well as being a dick move, it was also a stupid lie to tell considering the great co-parenting relationship OP has with his ex wife. Like did Michael really believe that OP wouldn't go to his ex wife about it considering that this involves their children? \n\nMichael knew full well that his wife wouldn't tolerate that bullshit and he still tried.\n\nAlso even though OP stated that Michael \"didn't seem\" to have a problem with OP being in the picture, you can guarantee that Michael had a problem with it from day 1 and now he's married to Thora, he's more comfortable in making it obvious because he feels that OP shouldn't be in the picture anyway.", "My kid's stepmother is like that, except she cries and runs out of the room. My kid is 8 and feels bad that she makes her stepmother cry so she just stopped mentioning me at their house. It makes me so angry but there's not much I can do about it. I also don't really want to hear about her stepmother, but I understand it's part of my kid's life and it would be unreasonable to tell her to hide that from me. So I smile and listen to the stories and put a lot of effort into keeping my opinion to myself.", "From personal experience, step can be better than bio. I\u2019d argue my Step MIL cares more about my fianc\u00e9 than either of his bio parents.", "She cries and runs out of the room? Is your ex dating a 5 year old?", "She's about 13 years younger than him, recently 30, I believe, maybe still 28 or 29. When I'm feeling especially salty, my friends and I call her the child bride.", "NTA this is actually worrying because it\u2019s a big red flag.

He\u2019s the one trying to do the alienating. Don\u2019t give in to him.", "My ex and I co-parented exactly the way OP described. We even had houses on the same street so the kids could go back and forth as they pleased. We actually both had boyfriends/girlfriends who couldn't handle it and they got the boot immediately. Interesting that Michael waited until they were married to have a problem with it.", "Honestly you sound like such an amazing involved father and the way you speak of your ex as \u2018the best mom\u2019 is so wonderful.

What u/Princess-She-ra doesn\u2019t seem to understand is that your role in this is your kids, FULL STOP.  The fact that you worked out a great coparenting relationship shows how well you take your responsibility in this, and credit to Thora too.
