We have remained very close and she and I don't follow a strict parenting plan. We do our best to have the kids see us both as much as possible. We celebrate every birthday, every Christmas together, and we show up to support our kids together as much as we can make work with our jobs. Our families are also still very tight. The kids love it. Sometimes it will be my parenting time but they want Thora and so they spend that day with her, or vice versa. Works so well for the kids.\n\nThora married Michael in November 2021. He and I got along in the beginning. He clearly loved Thora and was great with the kids, which is what Thora and I cared most about. But then this past summer some things changed with Michael. An example is Indie was singing and playing an instrument at this little talent show his summer camp set up. Thora and I both went, so did Michael, who took the day off work. Michael did not look happy to see me and once Thora was not within earshot or sightline, he was visibly tense and I swear he groaned at some point near me. Then Thora had to go out of state to see a friend of hers who was very sick. The kids chose to stay with me and I don't believe Michael was happy about that. I tried to ask him about it but he swore things were fine.\n\nIn November Indie and Colbie had a busy month with different stand out things within extra curricular's and school. I was lucky enough to attend 9/10 of them with Thora attending 8/10. Michael got to attend 3/10. All three were ones I could attend and it felt very much like he didn't want me there. \n\nLate last month when Michael and I were the ones attending a school function for the kids that he asked me to show up to less of the kids events and let him and Thora do some of that stuff with the kids as a family. I told him they already do. He said not when I'm around. That I am getting in the way of him being a parental figure for the kids. I told him he was a parental figure and the kids love him. He said they will never consider us equal until they see him instead of me at some of these events. He said it's important for the more \"stable family unit of four\". I told him I was not willing to miss the kids events. He did not take it well and accused me of interfering and alienating their chances of a family unit. He texted me after the event with things he wanted me to miss (including Indie's Elementary school graduation in May). I told him it was not happening. He told me Thora wanted this too.\n\nThora knew nothing of this and told me the kids would be so upset if we did what Michael wanted, which I knew also. She was angry at Michael. Michael is angry at me still. He called me an asshole. I don't want to believe I'm an asshole but I know this is not the norm for every divorced parents situation and it makes me ask if I am TA for not letting them have some of those events just them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677926386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hwbd6/aita_for_refusing_to_miss_some_of_my_kids_events/", "score": 1097, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Part of me can't even believe I am posting this but my reason for posting, and my reason for asking, is I know how uncommon this is for people. I also know while my kids love Michael. They in no way see him the same as their mom and I. I know Michael has been so good with my kids and that he might be feeling jealous. Perhaps I was too quick to reject it. I question if I should have worked with him in some way or handled this whole thing better. My desire to be there for my kids was all I could think about. But maybe I handled it poorly and was unfair to Michael. An asshole even. Maybe it's also unfair to the kids.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t envy stepparents, i know it\u2019s gotta be hard. I have a stepmom, she\u2019s been with my dad for at least 26 years. My parents divorced when i was 10 and we lived with my dad. She moved in when we were teens. It was very rough at first, and to be honest she was not\ngood to my older sister at all.

Thora and you are Mom and Dad and that will never change.  I would be grateful that he loves Thora and the kids bc the more love in their lives, the better.  He can join the parenting team, but he will not supplant you are the kids' Dad.  He needs to learn how to co-parent.  It is good for the kids to see everyone getting along.

And the new husband's reaction makes me concerned for your children. Any person that's trying to isloate children from bio-parents are doing that for a reason and intentions are probably not good. I would check in on the kids more often tbh. He is  insecure and controlling and putting his irrational feelings before the wellbeing of the children. He knew the family dynamic he was getting into when he got married. And honestly the kids will never see him as \"equal\", him marrying their mother should not replace you as their father. My goodness this man gets on my nerves. Don't communicate with him anymore, talk to your ex wife and continue to support your children.", "NTA on any level.  Michael is the one trying to alienate the children from you and assume the father role full time.  He is slowly trying to undermine the wonderful setup that you and Thora have for the children.

The fact that you and Thora have such a good co-parenting relationship AND the fact that Michael started out interacting positively with you are really good starting points.\n2. The fact that Michael is focused on being 'equal' with you is a very yellow flag. The fact that he lied about Thora also wanting you to stay away is a red flag.\n3. I guess I'd start with two key considerations: (1) Is there some piece of what Michael wants that IS (or could be tweaked to be) reasonable? and (2) How do the kids feel about time with Michael?\n4. Him asking you not to show up for you daughter's elementary graduation is out of the question. But are there some practices you all have that are maybe heavier on the 'we are still all together focus' than they have to be? Some examples: Does it end up that there never any weekends when Michael, Thora and the kids get to do something fun/special on their own? Is every holiday all about the kids seeing both your side and Thora's side of the family and never Michaels? I could see how that could be very frustrating for him.\n5. While you/Thora, Thora/Michael consider some tweaks to family plans that the kids and you all are good with, maybe Thora can ask Michael to do some counseling. The best step-parent anecdotes I read here are about the step-parents who embrace whatever level of relationship suits the kids' needs (whether it is more like another parent or like just a safe, friendly adult). The thing is, it's up to Michael to refocus his priorities from competing with you to accepting what works best for the kids.\n6. It is possible for Michael to need to reframe his perspective AND for him to have a legitimate frustration that there's almost no time for the four of them to be a family without you present. It is possible (just possible) for the kids to be happy to have you and Thora together at everything and also possible that they would also be happy spending a Thanksgiving or Memorial Day weekend with Michael's family and catching your family at the next holiday. (If not that, maybe something else.)\n7. I think there's a good chance that Michael's just a temporary ahole here and that you three adults have what it takes to repair this glitch in the family dynamics. I am very hopeful that all will do just that. Good wishes to you and the whole family.", "NTA...

So I\u2019d really urge you to start from a place of compassion and reason with Michael. Yes, it\u2019s on Thora to try to manage him, but keeping a conversation open with the three of you is probably the best way to handle this initially. This guy obviously really loves your children, which you\u2019re obviously grateful for. You can de-escalate the situation, or at least try and that\u2019s probably a good first step versus playing tit for tat and getting worked up and excluding him causing turmoil and tension around the adults. It\u2019s not a good space for the kids to be in and especially don\u2019t want them to feel like they have to choose who to love. He\u2019s definitely completely wrong and a jerk, but try understanding that it\u2019s coming from a place of love and insecurity.

You are their dad, and sounds like a great dad, and have clocked more years in their lives. He basically won\u2019t be able to catch up to that. Unless some real bad behavior goes down on your part, they will always feel more comfortable and safer with you than they will with him. That is just the effects of time and the early formative years. He is the stepdad, and needs to realize that he is an addition to the family and how to be a good one. \n\nHe has to accept that it is not a family unit of four. It almost sounds like he is trying to replace you on some level. You guys have a kind of rare setup where the divorced parents get along fine and are there for the kids.

It will not work out well for him.", "NTA,you're their father,f his bs", "Did he want kids of his own? We're they planning to have any?

Don't give in on this.", "NTA. You and Michael are not equal to the kids, and that is appropriate. It is alarming that he would expect otherwise. He sounds a bit unhinged and like he needs help accepting that your kids already have a father. Your role as their father does not diminish his role as a step-parent, but he is way out of line actively trying to diminish your role and edge you out of your own kids\u2019 lives. Personally, I would not take such a threat lightly at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, both of you going to the same events is by definition more equal in the eyes of the kids as one person showing up to events the other misses. Such a system is obviously not equal. He is pushing for such a scheme because what he really wants is for your kids to love you less and feel less close to you and that you are less dependable.

He can\u2019t get out of his head that he should be the \u201cprimary father figure\u201d you can hear it in your example and as he talks about their \u201cstable family unit of 4.\u201d He wants to replace not be in addition to OP.", "I 100% agree.", "Right?! The audacity of stepdad asking bio dad to not show up for his kids!!!", "Yes! Thora & Michael need to plan their own activities with the kids. But school events and such, everyone should be there to support.", "Typically in child custody decisions, bio parents get a \u2018right of first refusal\u2019 to take over child care if the bio parent with custody at the time isn\u2019t there for whatever reason. That\u2019s a lot of words. Essentially, bio parent has to give the other bio parent the choice to take over child care before they find alternate child care. So no, step parents get no say when their spouse (bio parent) is away.", "That is not how it works. Almost all parenting plans (OP says they don't stick to a strict one, but I assume they still have one in place) give the other parents 'first right of refusal\", so if one parent can't have the kids (aka work trip)* then they go to the other parent. Your way of seeing things is very, very outdated.", "Not old fashioned at all, asinine is what it is. Easily one of the top 5 dumbest things I\u2019ve seen on this sub.", "You\u2019ve made a lot of assumptions here that OP has already refuted. Your idea of a divorced dads involvement is not his reality or the reality of other divorced with children people I know today. \n\nThings have changed\u2026.", ">OP is forever their dad and clearly a great vo parent but the kids live now with Michael.\n\nThe kids live equal amount with OP, they have a ~50/50 custody setup.", "Again I think you don\u2019t understand how family court works. If the the stepdad gets a new job across the country, OP DOES have a say in the custody agreement and even if the family could move across\nThe country. The court could literally prevent that move if it\u2019s determined not in the best interest of the kids. Also in that situation, The onus is not inherently on OP to travel to his children but likely on the family moving away to provide that. Also assuming they have 50/50 custody which it sounds like they do, OP Does have a say In who his child\u2019s GP is and in schools. \n\nYou really don\u2019t know what the F you are saying. Things are very different now as they should be for involved parents.", "Uh, that is not how joint parenting works. You don't get to move a child without the other parents consent.", "OP can go to court to prevent his children from being moved away by Michael,  depending on custody agreements he may have every right to challenge changing doctors,  schools etc.  Just because Michael married OPs ex doesn't mean Michael steps in as the new dad.  Hell, Michael pulling crap like this can be seen as parental alienation.  Also quit using being old as an excuse for your idiotic statements.", "If Malcom gets a job across the country, Thea will decide if they all go, or if Malcom goes alone, or if they divorce.\n\nIf the decision to move out of state is made, OP will retain a lawyer and the children will be mandated to stay in state while custody is litigated.\n\nThat is the thing, the children remain OP's children and the courts will enforce that. Medical decisions must also be joint in terms of joint custody. If OP disagrees that the school district move is a good one, he can get an injunction and begin litigation.\n\nRight now there is joint custody and an informal arrangement. If Michael and Thora. decide that now they are a \"four-person unit\" and OP is not part of their parental collective, he would litigate to retain his parental rights.\n\n*Edit typo and clarity", ">Now, if Malcolm gets a job across the country the family will go and OP will have no say\n\nHe didn't get a job across the country. And no, that's not what would happen. Courts favor parents in favor of stepparents. Op can take a court order who stops his children to move away. Especially if it's about the stepfather's job.\n\n>If they choose together to change schools I'm pretty sure op won't gave any say in that.\n\n I'm pretty sure he would. \n\n Why do you think the stepfather has more say in the lives and education of these kids that their father?? The decisions for the kids will be taken by their parents, and it's malcolm the one who wouldn't be able to do anything. You seem to believe that stepfather has more rights than the kids's father. \n\n I hope op's ex sends him to the curb because it's obvious he cares more about his own insecurities than about the children's happiness and wellbeing. \n\n I really hope you don't have kids and that you didn't forced them to reject their father in favor of a stepparent who doesn't care about their happiness. You sound really awful honestly.", "You\u2019re making an awful lot of assumptions there pal. You are literally just making things up at this point.", "What blows my mind is the fact that OP is so willing to allow this guy an important role in his children's life because MORE LOVE AND SUPPORT IS A GOOD THING! But the dude just keeps puffing his chest out to see who's the manlier man, who can be best dad figure, who's more import to the kids, when the kids love them both differently in their own special way. I just don't get it. OP, NTA.", "Absolutely op should do this", "Yea, OP and Thora are doing great at this. My dad sucks at realizing that HE'S the parent and my stepmom isn't. I don't see her in a position of power/authority when it comes to me doing things. I'm 17f and I ask/inform him of events, even if last minute, and he then goes and asks her!?! I don't care what she thinks and I can't mention this to him because if I did or tried I'd get into trouble \ud83d\ude24", "No. Bad, bad take. That\u2019s being drawn into the game. OP needs to stay above it.", "Maybe. But I don't think Michael will agree with any of that. He wants me around less for the big moments for the kids (graduations, concerts, games, plays, etc) and that is not something I am willing to skip for him.", "Nah, Michael needs to take a step back and shut up, he doesn\u2019t get to make decision for those kids, their parents do and as long and mum and dad are happy with the way things are Michael either needs to grin and bear it or not show up however he doesn\u2019t get to tell the children\u2019s BIOLOGICAL FATHER how to parent. Step dad is trying to force bio dad out so he can be the only daddy eventually.", "It's nothing to do with OP though, it's for Thora and Michael to work out with a marriage counsellor. OP is just staying in his own lane and supporting his kids", "Probably British; in Australia they say \"ss\u1d09d \u01dd\u0265\u0287 \u0183u\u1d09\u029e\u0250\u0287\".", "Or fellow Brit :)", "Both. Born in Britain, raised in Aus, living in Britain now.", "Yup.  He doesn't get the different relationship dynamics. \n\nIn terms of relationship to wife/ex:\n\nHusband>ex\n\nIn terms of relationship to kids:\n\nFather>step", "Yes they are. In the end I want the best for them and I want for things to remain as friendly and as loving as they can for them. We can't have that if more tempers flare and lines get drawn.", "Sorry, I missed that one ..That also would change my view somewhat but not entirely.", "Sorry, I didn't realise this was a custody battle. That's a whole different set of arguments.", "I understand but as far as I know there would have to be one helluva compelling reason for a court to prevent this. Leaving the country is a different matter of course and in that case both biological parents do have to agree.", "And that's a battle he'll always lose. OP will always be their father. One who's always been there for them. Someone they can count on finding in the audience when they look for someone for reassurance. \n\nI hate how he's trying to alienate OP, to \"create their family unit of four\". It's like he wishes OP were a deadbeat so he could step up and be the parent. \n\nOP is a great dad. Congratulations, keep it up!", "Micheal could have been a role model for the kids showing how great co-parenting with a bonus parent could have been looked like. Instead he is stomping on it.", "Yes you get the main fact my guy", "That\u2019s all well and good but that changes if his ex wife changes her current position on all this", "And you shouldn\u2019t. Keep showing up for your kids regardless of how he feels. Hope everything works out. Good luck.", "He's delusional.", "Nor should you agree with it. You are their father and want to be part of their life, so stand your ground and don\u2019t let anyone talk you out of going to any kid event. You are NTA, but Michael is. Suggest to Thora that she and Michael see a couples therapist about this because maybe he\u2019ll be more receptive to that than the 3-way counseling. He\u2019s the one that needs therapy, so do what you can to get him there, because if he doesn\u2019t resolve this it will start to affect the kids.", "Please keep an eye out for parental alienation from Michael. It sounds like he wants to be the perfect little nuclear family with your kids and ex-wife, and you being around so much ruins that for him. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he starts trying to buy your kids favor over you with extravagant gifts or trips, etc. He wants you out of the picture or at least WAY less prominent in it, and he\u2019s already demonstrated he\u2019s not above lying or manipulation to get his way.", "YOUR relationship with YOUR kids is more important than his relationship with your kids. NTA", "Not that I'm the authority but as a step parent myself Michael is so far out of line it isnt even funny. The audacity of him to ask or even expect you to miss any of your kids events is mindblowing to me. Let him be mad at you, it's his problem not yours.", "You sound like a good guy who is trying to do right by everyone.  I agree with the majority here who say leave the guy to your wife to deal with.  If you both like things as is, she'll make the arguments (or ultimatums) for you.  This keeps you from being involved in their relationship and gives things time to settle.  If your ex is furious with him, she already understands his overstepping and serious betrayal of her trust.  Let's hope he can pull his head out of his ass and change his perspective on this.  You are NTA.", "If he\u2019s trying to stop you going to your children\u2019s events, then no, he is the worst thing for them.", "I wrote a post separately about trying to encourage Michael to do separate things that you have no interest in with your kids - lol birdwatching.  He's feeling threatened and maybe things aren't completely right with Thora and him. \n\nStand your ground!  Encourage Michael's relationship with your children if it can be healthy.  It sounds like Thora isn't putting up with nonsense.  Whatever you do, don't back down or allow parental alienation.  It is not a unit of \"four\" - at least not on his end.  It's a unit of three and three with one addition, and a couple units of two, and at some point one of your side.", "This goes against any custody agreement I\u2019ve ever heard of. If one of the two parents who has custody isn\u2019t available, the other one has the kids. The only exception would be if they\u2019re both unavailable, and in that case they would go to another trusted adult (which may or may not be the step-father).", "But Michael is not their dad and will never be. \nHe has no right to ask OP to not be there for his children.\nHe is also a liar.", "It\u2019s not a custody battle but what I\u2019m trying to say is you have made enormous assumptions without knowing their custody. In American 50/50 custody arrangements the things you assume the dad has no say in are wildly inaccurate. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\nTrying to say.\n\nYou are the one assuming they live primarily with their mother. Inaccurate. You are assuming the step dad is involved in day to day decisions (OP says inaccurate) you are assuming that bc the mother remarried that is the\u201dnew family unit\u201d again why? This is inaccurate. They have two family units now, not a replacement one\u2026.\n\nSo: in 50/50 arrangements like what OP has they do have equal say on what school, what dr, what after school activities, what state the child lives in etc. that will not change with the mom getting married unless custody for some reason we\u2019re to change.", "It's not.
