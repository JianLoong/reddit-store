We have remained very close and she and I don't follow a strict parenting plan. We do our best to have the kids see us both as much as possible. We celebrate every birthday, every Christmas together, and we show up to support our kids together as much as we can make work with our jobs. Our families are also still very tight. The kids love it. Sometimes it will be my parenting time but they want Thora and so they spend that day with her, or vice versa. Works so well for the kids.\n\nThora married Michael in November 2021. He and I got along in the beginning. He clearly loved Thora and was great with the kids, which is what Thora and I cared most about. But then this past summer some things changed with Michael. An example is Indie was singing and playing an instrument at this little talent show his summer camp set up. Thora and I both went, so did Michael, who took the day off work. Michael did not look happy to see me and once Thora was not within earshot or sightline, he was visibly tense and I swear he groaned at some point near me. Then Thora had to go out of state to see a friend of hers who was very sick. The kids chose to stay with me and I don't believe Michael was happy about that. I tried to ask him about it but he swore things were fine.\n\nIn November Indie and Colbie had a busy month with different stand out things within extra curricular's and school. I was lucky enough to attend 9/10 of them with Thora attending 8/10. Michael got to attend 3/10. All three were ones I could attend and it felt very much like he didn't want me there. \n\nLate last month when Michael and I were the ones attending a school function for the kids that he asked me to show up to less of the kids events and let him and Thora do some of that stuff with the kids as a family. I told him they already do. He said not when I'm around. That I am getting in the way of him being a parental figure for the kids. I told him he was a parental figure and the kids love him. He said they will never consider us equal until they see him instead of me at some of these events. He said it's important for the more \"stable family unit of four\". I told him I was not willing to miss the kids events. He did not take it well and accused me of interfering and alienating their chances of a family unit. He texted me after the event with things he wanted me to miss (including Indie's Elementary school graduation in May). I told him it was not happening. He told me Thora wanted this too.\n\nThora knew nothing of this and told me the kids would be so upset if we did what Michael wanted, which I knew also. She was angry at Michael. Michael is angry at me still. He called me an asshole. I don't want to believe I'm an asshole but I know this is not the norm for every divorced parents situation and it makes me ask if I am TA for not letting them have some of those events just them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677926386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hwbd6/aita_for_refusing_to_miss_some_of_my_kids_events/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Part of me can't even believe I am posting this but my reason for posting, and my reason for asking, is I know how uncommon this is for people. I also know while my kids love Michael. They in no way see him the same as their mom and I. I know Michael has been so good with my kids and that he might be feeling jealous. Perhaps I was too quick to reject it. I question if I should have worked with him in some way or handled this whole thing better. My desire to be there for my kids was all I could think about. But maybe I handled it poorly and was unfair to Michael. An asshole even. Maybe it's also unfair to the kids.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t envy stepparents, i know it\u2019s gotta be hard. I have a stepmom, she\u2019s been with my dad for at least 26 years. My parents divorced when i was 10 and we lived with my dad. She moved in when we were teens. It was very rough at first, and to be honest she was not\ngood to my older sister at all. And my mother was jealous so feuded with her for a long time. \n\nBut as we became adults it got a whole lot better. And she helped me nurse my mother when she was dying of cancer. I\u2019ll never forget a few days before she died, she said to my sister and I that we were lucky that stepmom was our mother now and we wouldn\u2019t be alone. That was huge coming from her and the first time i ever saw stepmom cry. \n\nShe\u2019ll never be \u201cequal\u201d to my mom, but she is my mom and my family and i always introduce her as my mom or say \u201cmy parents\u201d even though I call her by her name. \n\nYou are a good person for loving those kids as your own and not giving up on them.", "You are so not the a-hole. Not even a little. If he wants, he should organise activities for the 4 of them when the kids are with Thora and don't have any pre-arranged extra-curricular activities. He is too lazy to organize any family activities/outings himself, and expects you to compromise your relationship with the children to make things easy for him. Do not give in to that. Continue to co-parent as you have been. Michael is a huge a-hole. Pay him no mind. He's Thora's problem now, not yours. Let her deal with him.", "Yeah, he thinks you're an AH because you aren't playing into his little fantasy of a ready made family and you're not letting him get away with his crap. All the things that make *him* the AH.\n\nGood luck!", "Sorry, I used quite an aggressive phrase not entirely correctly but I was trying to make a point. Your ex has married a new guy and he now carries a responsibility for their upbringing including all the day to day decisions. The", "He is but his ex chose to meet and marry a new guy who is now their stepfather. He is the one they should stay with if she goes away. Sorry if that's an old fashioned view but I am old and I'm standing by my opinion.", "Sorry  you are right  they weren't just arbitrarily sent there. That said, the ex made a decision to marry Michael and therefore commit both her and her kids future to him. OP is forever their dad and clearly a great vo parent but the kids live now with Michael. He's responsible  with the ex  for the day to day decisions about their upbringing now and needs to have the kids respect and hopefully eventually love as a stepparent. This is now the nuclear family and he is the one they should normally stay with. Old fashioned? Maybe  but  as stated, I am old.", "Then that\u2019s between Thora and Michael. \nIt\u2019s not his place to dictate how parents should be parenting their kids and he seems to have been aware at the beginning and is now changing the rules to suite himself. \nStep back, let them sort it out but hold your line otherwise.", "I understand that you and Thora wish to keep things as they were, but Michael has said what he said, and now things are/going to be different. He's not a parent or a father but he is a step parent and he is part of an equation. And all this anger isn't going to help anyone and WILL Harm the children.\n\n I wouldn't attempt to navigate this without a professional. who knows - there may be an easy solution to this, there may be something uncomplicated that can happen and resolve this, I don't know - but I do know that you need help.", "Hello fellow Aussie.", "Correct, but I also commend OP for his response, because how easy would it be for him to completely nuke a previously respectful, amicable situation? He\u2019s being kind, way kinder than Michael deserves, to be sure. But the children are more important to OP than whatever blended drama his ex\u2019s husband is trying to cook up.", "He does not get to make all day to day decisions. He does not make decisions for my home or my kids when they are with me. He might be an equal partner with Thora for their home. But he's not making all the decisions.", "That's not old fashioned, that's ridiculous.  If one parent is out of town, the kids stay with their other parent by default, but especially if they are given the option and choose to stay with dad.  Step parents don't get custodial time.  Just, no.\n\nNTA.  Michael is not your kids' parent, he doesn't get a say in these kinds of things.", "You think kids should be with their stepfather v biological father if the mom is away? Why is that old fashioned?", "Marrying the ex does NOT mean stepdad now has more rights than OP. OP and the mother are the ones to make the day to day decisions about their children. Period. Stepdad needs to slow his roll. It sounds like this is a 50/50 custody arrangement, OP is not a part-time dad, no more than the mom is a part-time mom. They are co-parenting in a very healthy way and the stepdad wants to blow that up. He is thinking about himself, his ego, and his jealousy, not what is actually best for the children.", "It isn\u2019t old fashioned; it\u2019s just a bizarre take that few people will agree with. The stepdad isn\u2019t responsible for the \u2018day-to-day\u2019 as they split time between their mother and father who co-parent to make decisions. The stepdad should be taking his lead from both actual parents.", "I don't know, the responses here suggest my opinions aren't the current view of these things.", "That is not an old school view either,  it's just your opinion"]}
