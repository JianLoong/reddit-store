I was worried about him and wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nThere was a long line at the self-checkout and no other option, and just as I was pulling up my cart (just a few items) this woman swooped in and pushed her full cart in ahead of me. We'd arrived at the same time, so I just accepted my bad luck and waited behind her.\n\nTen seconds later, she leaves the cart and moseys off, apparently in no rush, to the bakery on the other side of the store and starts looking through the bread. She didn't say a word to me, and she's too far for me to call her back, unless I want to scream at the top of my lungs.\n\nMeanwhile, the line keeps moving, and I'm standing behind an empty cart, apparently no longer in line and about to lose my spot. When the line has moved up a few spots, I shrug, go around her cart, and rejoin it.\n\n(I realized later I could have moved her cart, but at the time it didn't occur to me to touch a stranger's stuff without them asking.)\n\nA minute later she comes back, yells \"What the fuck? BITCH\", and then loudly and sarcastically tells the next two people to go ahead of her. So yeah, obviously not in a hurry. I just ignored her, checked out and left.\n\nI wouldn't leave a cart unattended in line unless it was literally a matter of seconds, like grabbing a drink/gum from the next checkout over or something, and I always assumed this was the rule: if you won't get back before the line moves, you need to go to the end.
