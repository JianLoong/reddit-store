One of their daughters was on a TV singing competition like X Factor or America/Britain's got talent in the 2000s. During the visit, they decided to share one of their favourite performances their daughter did on this show, I did request for it out of curiosity. \n\nThe showrunners decided to split the last 6 contestants between the youngest and oldest and they had to perform a song together. Their daughter was in the younger group and they (her parents) chose this performance because of how energetic and vibrant it is and how much fun the girls appeared to be having in it.\n\nWatching it, I was perplexed and slightly repulsed. Here are some of the lyrics from it:\n\n\"He really hit the spot\"\n\n\"Good things \"come\" to boys who wait\" (They sing this while pointing down to their lower area)\n\n\"Makes my cherry \"pop\"\n\n\"Got me hot\"\n\n\"Sweet on down\"\n\n\"Baby don't stop\"\n\nThere was also weird sexual whispering, the dancing was very silly and last but not least their daughter and the 2 other girls were 17 years old. Only thing that would have it more inappropriate would be if they were wearing revealing dresses. I don't know what demographic the show targeted but I presume if it was on main time TV on the national TV station the producers would know better than to do a song that inappropriate. \n\nThey asked for my opinion. I responded giving them some friendly advice not to share this performance with any other visitors. The dad asked me why and I listed my problems as stated above and I questioned why they aren't bothered by it and what the producers were trying to do. They replied saying that the girls chose or selected the song from a list. I said it never should have been an option for them in the first place given it was on national TV. One of them asked what's my problem with it?. I said that it makes their daughter look \"sexual\"  and that for the visitors they likely usually get (they're older than my wife and I), it could be offputting and I advised them to pick any other song their daughter did rather than that. The mum basically told me to \"grow up\" and get a sense of humour. My wife noticed it was very tense so she came up with a reason for us to leave. Got a pretty frosty goodbye and here we are.\n\nI wasn't trying to offend them or attack their daughter. I was just saying it's probably best they don't show that inappropriate stuff and show something better their daughter did on that show.", "created_utc": 1686342124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145fp73/aita_for_advising_friends_to_stop_sharing_an/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Besides that, they are 17 years old, not toddlers.", "YTA.  Have you ever listened to the stuff sung by young starlets trying to be taken seriously as adults?

It was just a video of their kid singing, no hidden agenda", "The girls chose the song. Even if you disagreed with it, this wasn\u2019t a battle for you to fight here. YTA", "YTA. You sexualised that child.

You gave them unsolicited advice and sexualized their daughter. They asked for your opinion. You could have said, \"She did great!

And it was creepy.", "I always get hammered for this, but I will write it again; that is, when someone asks for your opinion, use some common sense and tact as they do not want to hear your real opinion, they just want you to reinforce theirs.

The fact that this song was selected from a list that was presented to them really disturbs me.", "NTA.  MAYBE the situation should have had nothing to do, maybe it's none of your business, but they ASKED what you thought.  And you told them.  \nI see so many people saying you sexualized their child, and I don't think you did.  A lot of people would express concern with someone so young singing lyrics like that.  And there a lot of sick people that actually WOULD sexualize it, whether it was intended to be or not.  \nHowever, I'll change my answer and say YTA, IF it ever comes up again.  You gave your opinion once.  They didn't agree with it.  At the end of the day, it's their child, and you'd be an ass for trying to tell them what to do with the video of her any further.  You're NOT for simply expressing your opinion.", "Nta because they asked. Yeah 17 year olds will sing lewd songs. However, the producers also had her gesture towards her crotch while singing said lewd song. Someone, please tell me how that itself wasn't a form of sexualization of a minor.

People shouldn't ask questions to which they don't want honest answers.\n\nI personally disagree with your opinion, but that's neither here nor there.", "Nta, they asked for your opinion and you gave it. They don't have to proceed based on your opinion. They can, however, think oddly of you because of your discomfort.", "YTA. You surely knew better, right? There's honesty, and then there is whatever that was that you did. I don't know what your purpose was, anyway.", "I thought you were talking about a 7 year old, not a 17 year old. If you were talking about a 7 year old I would agree with you, some of those kids talent shows are incredibly skeevy. 17 is not exactly a child though.", "Yeah, YTA by a mile.", "YTA", "What is AITA?", "YTA\n\n\"Sexualising\" something doesn't mean you personally are turned on, it means you are assigning sexual characteristics where there are none.

Usually followed with wanting the thing banned.\n\nYou are the one sexualising the girls here.", "YTA", "Yeah sorry, you may want to take a closer look at yourself if it bothered you that much. Especially that song which is a play off of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy by the Andrew sisters who performed in USO shows in the 40's.
