I feel weird AF wherever someone thanks me for *my* service because my husband was military. Like.... Thanks, but I just want the discount on my lumber and fencing cuz it's expensive. Also OP, I'd bet that *if* this person is actually military that he probably like just got out of basic training or something. Nta.", "You are right.  We do fake it, everyday.  But that's OK. I behave one way when I am teaching science,  another when learning it, another when among strangers and more different still among friends. And we won't discuss my behavior with family.

Behaviors are adaptable to the situation at hand.", "What about the President's and congress that actually send them to war? \n\nYou do realise the military don't choose what wars, countries, etc, they fight in.", ">aren\u2019t you fucking ashamed of yourself? \n\nThere\u2019s no legal way of escaping service once you\u2019ve signed up, you need to fulfill your contract to completion. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve grown, had a change of heart or the evidence on the side of the war has shifted\u2026the government owns your ass for eight years and can do what they like. \n\nYou won\u2019t find many veterans who are happy with how those wars were prosecuted. Some are proud of the individual work they did, some are ashamed at some of the actions taken in the name of American imperialism and most have a mix of shame and pride. They got girls and women to school and provided healthcare services but they also destroyed entire families. They oversaw democratic elections but they also funnelled billions of cash straight into the hands of corrupt pederasts and war criminals. They ousted an autocrat but created a failed state.", "Counterpoint: you put up with the military's bullshit, too, and you didn't even get a paycheck out of it!", "I always feel weird about it also. But I do appreciate the sentiment when offered sincerely....\nMilitary families bear a high burden in support of their enlisted family members. Most of the time, no one thinks about it.", "America has been at war most of its life. Its not a surprise to anyone  in our **all volunteer military** that they will have to participate in unjustified conflict.", "Which makes them even less respectable in my opinion. They just go out and kill people they don't know because some politician is pulling their puppet strings and told them to do it.", "Yes the system that forces people to choose military life in order to get basic human rights is to blame.

But for many decades it's clear that the main focus is in protecting the large corporations and/or GOP. I feel for every one who dies in vain and hope that the system chances soon. But meanwhile I criticize people who join the army. 1st amendment.", "Veterans don't give a s*** about being veterans. That was just an a******.", "NTA I'm a vet and I don't understand that attitude of entitlement.

Now he wants to play the veteran card for special treatment? He\u2019s the rude one", "That the first thing he said was that he was in the military to try and justify his action would put me right off and call him out on that behaviour alone.", "NTA - whether he is or was or had any connection with any military, where did he get the notion that he was now exempt from all social customs and could barge around doing what he liked?", "NTA\n\nWhat an entitled prick.", " DNTA unless he was in some way disabled. You were in no obligation to give up your seat to him because he was in the military. As a matter of fact, I think that many veterans would choose to give their seat up for you, and definitely would not use their status as a veteran to take someone\u2019s seat. That\u2019s just being an AH regardless of whether they have been in the military service.", "We grew up poor. I joined to get out of poverty. Few prople in my \"adult\" life even know I put in 12 years.

I would figure something else out. I would feel bad to even ask. The entitlement of a lot of people we encounter just baffles me most days.", "NTA, the veterans that deserve our respect are the ones not trying to flaunt it for perks.", "How does OP knows he is military? Anyone can say that and it does not give him the right to take her seat military or not", "Beautiful comment", "I blame the indoctrination we get during boot/basic. Idk about other people, but when I went through the army, we were constantly told that we \"The 1%\" and people basically owed their lives to us for protecting them.

I'm from a Navy family and I can't tell you how many servicemen I learned about growing up and hear about now that do the most heinous shit, usually to their wives and children. It's not at all uncommon for there to be domestic violence and other abuse issues. Not to mention, my uncle, who was in for 35 years and recently (forced) retired, constantly states how many men serving are complete shitheads and mentally void of common sense, logic, and basic emotional maturity. He constantly talks about how painfully dumb many of them were outside of anything specific to their duties. And most don't do anything special. \n\nSooo yeah, thanks for serving, i guess?", "I was in the military and completely agree. I will say there is some good being done but it's mainly by SOF and isn't generally well-known. Most (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc) was executed on bad premises and did help a bit in some ways but ultimately left those places worse off in others. None of it has been defending our freedom as people like to claim which is sad because so many lives have been lost including quite a few of my friends. Some can justify those losses to themselves but I can't. \n\nAll of that makes people thanking me for my service feel weird to me. Additionally, anyone who tries to flaunt it like this to get their way is immediately an asshole. They think they're better than everyone because of it if they even actually served.

I've had plenty of leaders in the Army that didn't understand that, so it's no surprise to see those kinds of people on the outside.", "I firmly believe that them feeling weird about it just means it's not said enough. If it were as common as someone saying thank you for them holding a door open, they wouldn't feel awkward. It's just a job for many, but a job with inherent risks (and a ton of bs) that few jobs have.\n\nThat being said, there is a sub group of AHs in every demographic, military included. Unfortunately OP ran into one of them. She's definitely NTA here.", ">once you\u2019ve signed up\n\nYeah, this is the part we're talking about", "I mean I got the free health care.

My sister is always amazed at the whole preferential treatment of military members on airplanes especially. It's totally an American thing. And a lot of those military people haven't even served in war zones. Lots of other jobs save people or people put their life on the line. Military shouldn't get any special treatment. They chose to join the military.\n\nI sort of have the same pet peeve with doctors in the US. They expect to be called doctor both at work but also outside of work.

I am sure that some of their issues with the war were how they were treated by civilians upon their return to the homefront.\n\nSomewhere along the lines, people got smarter and kinder and decided that blaming the poor smucks stuck fighting in a war, when it was American politicians who sent them there, was not how they wanted to treat their brothers, sons, (and now daughters and sisters), neighbors, and schoolmates.\n\nI am a historian.", "That \u2018thanks for your service\u2019 stuff is uniquely American for what I can gather.

Led to a lot of issues between me and my mom growing up because that kind of stuff just grows and gets worse each generation. I'll never know exactly what was going on in Grandpa's head but there was a lot of paranoia about government stuff and seemed at points to not quite understand where he was (we found journals of his that he'd hidden in the wall of his house).

I have family in the military and we all agree itd be better to serve an extra 20 years than have to put up with the parents and school higher ups.  Being a teacher is waaaay harder than people give it credit for. \n\nI'm not military or a teacher, but I'd pick military over the struggles teachers have to go through. I'm not a good enough person to deal with the issues they deal with, especially without strangling at least one parent.", "Agreed", "How have any of them done that in the past 50 years?
