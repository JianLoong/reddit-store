Every year we go to my Grandparents on Christmas Day for dinner. Our Xmas get together consists of my family, my brother, my Aunt/Uncle, 3 cousins and their kids. We have a fairly small family. Well my Grandmother is in her late 70\u2019s and decided just this week that she didn\u2019t want to host it this year. Totally understandable that she doesn\u2019t want to host anymore, timing is a bit short notice but that\u2019s fine. \n\nEvery year either on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning before my Grandparents thing, my Aunt will have my brother, three cousins and their kids over to make cookies and do gifts. So when my Grandma said she wasn\u2019t doing Xmas this year, I figured my Aunt would tell me \u201cno problem, just come to my house\u201d\u2026 but she didn\u2019t, she said she wasn\u2019t ready to host it but would start next year due to the short notice. What is kind of hurtful is that my Grandparents are now going to my Aunts house on Christmas Day for dinner.. as well as my brother, cousins and their kids. They\u2019re cooking and doing the whole thing. So when she said she wasn\u2019t ready to host it, she meant she didn\u2019t want my family coming lol. \n\n We\u2019re nice to everyone, helpful and give good gifts, we\u2019re not difficult people to be around. They are though so a part of me is relieved we won\u2019t be going to Christmas and will be able to do our own thing but another part me of is pissed and hurt that we were left out.. and I have already purchased gifts for everyone. My kids and I are semi-often excluded from things so I\u2019m not super surprised but somewhat am because it\u2019s freakin Christmas lol. AITA for this Xmas thing being the final straw and limiting any future interactions? I\u2019m kinda just done with all of them and over it.  They\u2019ll think I\u2019m the asshole for distancing myself but I think it\u2019s more than justified.", "created_utc": 1703187597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nvcf0/aita_being_excluded_from_annual_family_christmas/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given the fact this isn't the first time you and your family have been excluded, try not to take it to heart.  Use this time to plan something new and different for your family and make it a tradition.   Let your Aunt and crew think whatever they want, apparently they already do.

Can I bring you a dessert/salad?  And say if she wants to do a bigger dinner next year you and your kids are happy to come but since you know she didn't sign up for the big family dinner you're actually a little excited to have a quiet Christmas at home together, since you won't have them at home much longer.  You just want to offer help if she needs it.\n\nThis is a gracious thing to do if you don't really want to break ties with your family. If deep down you do, then go a different route :)", "Oh please, return or resell the gifts and tell them they're awful people who like to exclude kids one week before Christmas. NTA.

I am sorry and it is a heartless act that no family member has reached out to you re: this exclusion.\n\nI'd send a message to the host, and cc the rest, \"Hi, just checking-in, in light grandparents not hosting our family Christmas, I'm reaching out to clarify that me and the kids are not invited to your home for Christmas dinner this year. If I misunderstood, please let me know ASAP. Thanks and Merry Christmas.  \n\nThis benefits you so they all know you three have been excluded once again and it shuts down anyone attempting to wiggle out by saying, \"She misunderstood....they decided to do their own things. \n\nOnce the message is sent...release your feelings that bind you up cause we don't control what we do not control....then brainstorm with the kids on the fun, crazy and wonderful things you three can experience on your terms...corn dogs (or any non traditional favorite food or Chinese buffet) food for dinner-yes!

I wouldn\u2019t want to spend anymore holidays or time with her personally. And honestly I\u2019d consider going low contact with the others that have also been complicit in excluding you from these events. \n\nStart new traditions with your kids. Make cookies. Create a Christmas dinner with them using foods you all enjoy. Return or donate the gifts you purchased. \n\nAnd if you want to be REALLY petty, post it all on social media.

Wait until you can think more clearly, free from the raw emotions, and then make your decision. No need to rush, just focus on making this year a great one for your kids. (This year we are making it a day of our favourite things. We have all picked a dish each for me to make and the kids have picked their favourite PlayStation games.

You're a family of four, you have to take it on the chin when people don't want to host you. Generally the pattern in families is that traditions break down and realign when grandparents age out of hosting.

My Grandparents weren\u2019t in on what\u2019s going on, I think lol but I\u2019d 100% rather them go to my Aunts vs spending Christmas Day alone so I\u2019m not angry with them.

I don't think she needs to go NC, but I don't see anything wrong with returning the same energy.  I also wonder if the rest of the family knows she's been uninvited.

I considered that she may have felt piled on and overwhelmed, we spoke about it briefly and I offered to bring food or help anyway I could. Suggested all of us bringing finger foods maybe so there wouldn\u2019t be so much for her to do but she still said she wasn\u2019t ready to host this year. She was already going to have most of the family over there for cookies and gifts so the only difference would have been my immediate family and now my Grandparents.

Without reason, to our knowledge. Like they invite literally everyone, including random boyfriends/girlfriends of people but not us. \n\nWe\u2019ve never said anything. I deeply regret that we didn\u2019t address it immediately. This has been going for several years and we don\u2019t know if his Mom actually told his Aunt not to invite us or if his Aunt was upset about something. We\u2019ve asked his Mom and she says it\u2019s \u201csheer numbers.\u201d \n\nTake the opportunity to address it now. I wouldn\u2019t lobby to be invited but just let them know it is hurtful that you were excluded. Once a bit of time goes by it\u2019s hard to backtrack to say why we\u2019re we excluded?", "I really know how you feel. My only family told me he forgot about Christmas until last week. He has 2 kids who write Santa. It's impossible not to feel hurt.\nNTA", "NTA but did you consider hosting the family yourself? Families often arrange things so all adults or families bring meal contributions and it isn\u2019t too much of a burden for the host. \n\nAlternately perhaps you could host your grandparents and brother for Christmas Eve, Christmas evening or Boxing Day to still have a larger family Christmas for your family. Are you close to your brother? In this situation my brother would be included in my family gathering rather than at an aunt/ uncles.\n\nPerhaps start your own family tradition with the part of the family you feel closer to.\n\nI understand how hurtful it is to be excluded, and you imply that this is in character and a pattern with your aunt- however, she has hosted everyone before the usual lunch which sounds like she has made an effort. Maybe start new traditions with the family members you are closer to. Or is there a chance that the total number of people is an issue for your aunt and as a family if 4, but not one of her own kids, or parents, and your brother just being one person, that to reduce numbers your family is the one excluded?\n\nYou say it is a small family gathering, but if your 3 cousins have partners and children the numbers can add up quickly. With all of you is it around 20 people? I\u2019d suggest starting new traditions, or consider hosting yourself. Given that your grand parents are no longer hosting, this is a family transition time and hopefully you can set something up which really works for your family. I am sorry that this year has been so hurtful and I think your aunt has handled this very badly.", "Big one!", "NTA that's really hurtful. I'd be upset too. But hey, at least you get to have a chill Christmas with your family. We used to do the chaotic family holidays too. But now we just stay home and relax. It is absolute heaven. If we want to lie around in our jammies all day, playing with our gifts and watching Christmas movies, we do. We don't even cook (although I do on Christmas eve). We get take n bake pizza and just enjoy each other. I highly recommend it!", "NTA", "Time to bite the bullet and recognize that you're just not that important to them. Return the gifts and use the cash to have a nice time for yourselves, and go nc/lc with the Scrooges.", "I would respectfully ask for some clarity as to why everyone is being hosted except for your family.  Depending upon that answer, that would give me reason to set that distance boundary or not.  You deserve an explanation at the very least.  Judge the explanation and then make a decision", "Are you an AH for responding with, basically, doing nothing, to they AH behavior? No. Duh.", "But they  (auntie dear and the rest of family) know perfectly well, that it's hurtful. That's why they did it.   \nYou asked and still don't know why - what the purpose? OP should leave all this faaaar behind and don't think about \"loving family\" anymore.   \nCosy, immediate family Christmas celebrations are the best :)", "Why?? OP should return the gifts she bought for them, and STOP buying gifts for them in the future. Why reward people who treat you badly?", "Good for you!!! You and your  children should never be made to feel unwelcome by family! Have a fantastic Christmas at home! Huge hugs and happy fun juju flying your way!!", "Unfortunately I also share similar experiences of this nature, if I can impart something to you, start doing this now.  It took me way too many years and more heartache than I ever deserved to realize it wasn't me.... this was on them completely and totally.  Once I made this shift in my brain and heart I was better able to handle simply walking away.", "I have somebody who found themselves and family in a homeless shelter this holiday season, I think you for that."]}
