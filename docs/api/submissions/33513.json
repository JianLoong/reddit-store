Every year we go to my Grandparents on Christmas Day for dinner. Our Xmas get together consists of my family, my brother, my Aunt/Uncle, 3 cousins and their kids. We have a fairly small family. Well my Grandmother is in her late 70\u2019s and decided just this week that she didn\u2019t want to host it this year. Totally understandable that she doesn\u2019t want to host anymore, timing is a bit short notice but that\u2019s fine. \n\nEvery year either on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning before my Grandparents thing, my Aunt will have my brother, three cousins and their kids over to make cookies and do gifts. So when my Grandma said she wasn\u2019t doing Xmas this year, I figured my Aunt would tell me \u201cno problem, just come to my house\u201d\u2026 but she didn\u2019t, she said she wasn\u2019t ready to host it but would start next year due to the short notice. What is kind of hurtful is that my Grandparents are now going to my Aunts house on Christmas Day for dinner.. as well as my brother, cousins and their kids. They\u2019re cooking and doing the whole thing. So when she said she wasn\u2019t ready to host it, she meant she didn\u2019t want my family coming lol. \n\n We\u2019re nice to everyone, helpful and give good gifts, we\u2019re not difficult people to be around. They are though so a part of me is relieved we won\u2019t be going to Christmas and will be able to do our own thing but another part me of is pissed and hurt that we were left out.. and I have already purchased gifts for everyone. My kids and I are semi-often excluded from things so I\u2019m not super surprised but somewhat am because it\u2019s freakin Christmas lol. AITA for this Xmas thing being the final straw and limiting any future interactions? I\u2019m kinda just done with all of them and over it.  They\u2019ll think I\u2019m the asshole for distancing myself but I think it\u2019s more than justified.", "created_utc": 1703187597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nvcf0/aita_being_excluded_from_annual_family_christmas/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your extended family sound like they wanted to just be coy about excluding you if everything you said is true. Arrange to meet with your grandparents if you want since its possible they werent in on the whole arrangement either, but I wouldnt look back.", "NTA\n\nBut I would take the opportunity to just do my own thing this Christmas. Sounds like there were a lot of moving parts with the last minute changes. Your aunt indicated that she will host next year so I would just ride it out and see what happens next year.  People are really quick to say oh yeah, write them off, but they\u2019re not the ones who are in your shoes who are potentially never gonna see their family again.", "NTA. Your aunt has made her position clear and none of your family tried to stop her. Send cards from now on. Stop repairing bridges they keep burning.", "NTA, aren't family dynamics wonderful?  Given the fact this isn't the first time you and your family have been excluded, try not to take it to heart.  Use this time to plan something new and different for your family and make it a tradition.   Let your Aunt and crew think whatever they want, apparently they already do.  Meanwhile the best way to get back at them is to not let it get under your skin and show them that they are not a necessary part of you and your family having an awesome holiday.  Merry Christmas to you and yours.", "NTA \n\nBut is there a reason that you and your kids are excluded, like behavior problems?", "Start your own traditions and forget them..", "Return the gifts to the store. Take this opportunity to have a wonderful, cozy Christmas at home with your spouse and your lovely teenagers. Cook your own delightful Christmas dinner , either polling your teens for desired dishes or doing whatever dishes you enjoy most. Relish the idea that you're creating a new tradition for your kids that will knit your little family together.", " NTA. They distanced you without additional conversations. Why shouldn't you do the same if you feel it's best?", "INFO did you ask your aunt why you weren't invited and the whole family was?", "NTA, but I'm wondering if your aunt was piled on and had no intention of having that many people for Christmas until it kept snowballing after she had already talked to you.\n\nYou may want to reach out to her and say hey, I know this whole Christmas thing happened to you at the last minute, is there any way I can help?  Can I bring you a dessert/salad?  And say if she wants to do a bigger dinner next year you and your kids are happy to come but since you know she didn't sign up for the big family dinner you're actually a little excited to have a quiet Christmas at home together, since you won't have them at home much longer.  You just want to offer help if she needs it.\n\nThis is a gracious thing to do if you don't really want to break ties with your family. If deep down you do, then go a different route :)", "Oh please, return or resell the gifts and tell them they're awful people who like to exclude kids one week before Christmas. NTA. When they'll be old and in need, remember this year", "NTA whether you distance yourself or get closer in the future, you are not the ahole. What an intentional shitty thing to do. I am sorry and it is a heartless act that no family member has reached out to you re: this exclusion.\n\nI'd send a message to the host, and cc the rest, \"Hi, just checking-in, in light grandparents not hosting our family Christmas, I'm reaching out to clarify that me and the kids are not invited to your home for Christmas dinner this year. If I misunderstood, please let me know ASAP. Thanks and Merry Christmas.  \n\nThis benefits you so they all know you three have been excluded once again and it shuts down anyone attempting to wiggle out by saying, \"She misunderstood....they decided to do their own things. \n\nOnce the message is sent...release your feelings that bind you up cause we don't control what we do not control....then brainstorm with the kids on the fun, crazy and wonderful things you three can experience on your terms...corn dogs (or any non traditional favorite food or Chinese buffet) food for dinner-yes! Paint a crazy mural or other art and display it....Essentially: Create your Memories Intentionally. Best to you.", "NTA it\u2019s understandable to be upset in this situation - the best thing to do is forget about them and have a great Christmas with your immediate family", "Maybe donate their gifts to a shelter.

Did I read that correctly?? \n\nAnd now is hosting after telling only you that she wasn\u2019t?? \n\nYour aunt sounds like a horrible mean spirited person. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend anymore holidays or time with her personally. And honestly I\u2019d consider going low contact with the others that have also been complicit in excluding you from these events. \n\nStart new traditions with your kids. Make cookies. Create a Christmas dinner with them using foods you all enjoy. Return or donate the gifts you purchased. \n\nAnd if you want to be REALLY petty, post it all on social media. And when people ask why you weren\u2019t with your family or in any of their posts just say \u2018oh we weren\u2019t invited. I was told aunt wasn\u2019t hosting and figured everyone would be doing their own things\u2019. \n\nI truly hope you and your kids have a wonderful Christmas.", "NTA return their gifts and enjoy the quiet holiday and make a new tradition", "NTA return the gifts.  All of them. Your brother and your grandparents should be standing up for you.", "Wondering what your brother thinks about this. Does he know?", "NTA. Go over when they're all there, and text them all that you've dropped presents off on the doorstep, and that you hope they have a Merry Christmas. Then head home and enjoy the break", "NTA, at the moment your emotions are very raw. Focus on Christmas Day and your immediate family this year, maybe start some new traditions. Wait until you can think more clearly, free from the raw emotions, and then make your decision. No need to rush, just focus on making this year a great one for your kids. (This year we are making it a day of our favourite things. We have all picked a dish each for me to make and the kids have picked their favourite PlayStation games. Spending time and enjoying our day with our favourite things is our focus and the kids are very excited).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're a family of four, you have to take it on the chin when people don't want to host you.

My Grandparents weren\u2019t in on what\u2019s going on, I think lol but I\u2019d 100% rather them go to my Aunts vs spending Christmas Day alone so I\u2019m not angry with them. We will definitely be visiting them on another day but screw the rest of them lol.", "I agree 1 time might be too quick to write them off, but op said they are often not included. I don't think she needs to go NC, but I don't see anything wrong with returning the same energy.  I also wonder if the rest of the family knows she's been uninvited. If the rest of her family doesn't hate her,  aunts plans will probably implode without her having to do anything.", "I agree with this. I\u2019d even take all the gifts back and just send cards now.

I considered that she may have felt piled on and overwhelmed, we spoke about it briefly and I offered to bring food or help anyway I could. Suggested all of us bringing finger foods maybe so there wouldn\u2019t be so much for her to do but she still said she wasn\u2019t ready to host this year. She was already going to have most of the family over there for cookies and gifts so the only difference would have been my immediate family and now my Grandparents. I think she took this opportunity to stir shit up, which sucks but I think this Christmas might end up being the most relaxing and enjoyable Christmas yet! \ud83d\ude0a", "Do your own family thing, maybe on Christmas Eve or Boxing Day and invite your grandparents to *that.* Think of how much nicer it'd be for grandparents to just be around chill folks for a change.
