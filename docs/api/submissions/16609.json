On your birthday?!!!!!! \n\nYeah, time for some NC, lol. Get married, make it as pagan as possible, and be sure to broadcast the pics all over so she's confronted with \"the devil\" that stole her son.", "That alone is grounds for going NC.", ">passed down for 10 generations\n\nThat dress must have been priceless! This woman sounds seriously unhinged. I mean you could be living a thousand miles away from her and I'd say that's still not enough.", "Oh my god! Honestly if I was your best friend, I would be suing your MIL and maybe charges of destruction of property.", ">My dress wasn\u2019t exactly a wedding dress you\u2019d see in every wedding , it was passed down for 10 generations in my best friend\u2019s family\n\nAnd she DESTROYED it?! I'd have had her arrested, then never spoken to her again. You have way more tolerance than I do, and you are NTA. But please reconsider having her or anyone else who behaved like her at your wedding.", "Oh. My. God.\n\n\n\nIs there any way to make a replica of the dress? Pictures, designs, memory? Maybe a seamstress that specializes in either antiques or cosplay? I am so, SO sorry OP. \n\n\nFwiw, I'm a Christian, and I am so appalled by this. How DARE she STEAL and DESTROY to someone else's heirloom and have the AUDACITY to call it a birthday present?? I want to cry on your behalf.", "But... What!!! You could have go to the police for that! This woman is crazy! You should organize the venue in a satanic church and wore a black dress with horns for make her pay!", "Seriously think about going n/c. Your life would be easier", "They did,the family is a very influential one,they have friends in every department in my country from police,justice department,and even the president she had to pay over 100k for it. She tried to make me stop them  saying they wouldn\u2019t have any money left to help with the wedding(which my friend\u2019s family is paying for\ud83d\ude02)", "They have pictures of the dress,and will have it done again in Iceland by local seamstresses from scratch,my friends mother said that she will make sure to have it embroidered with family jewels so it could have as much sentimental value as the one set on fire"]}
