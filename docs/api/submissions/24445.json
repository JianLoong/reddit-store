My dad met this girl 6 years ago, they had two kids, my half siblings, ages 5, and 3. My dads gf earlier this week, went into labor early and unexpectedly. My dad called me asking if I could come stay with the kids. I told him I couldn\u2019t, this was my first week back on campus and I was still getting adjusted. He got angry and said that wasn\u2019t an excuse not to watch my siblings and needed me back. It is a 2 hour drive back, I wasn\u2019t willing to make on a school night. I told him I just simply couldn\u2019t, and I needed to focus on my studies.\n\nA few hours later he texted me angry saying thanks a lot for not helping out because he had to keep two children in the hospital waiting room til my aunt answered the phone, and that he couldn\u2019t be there for his girlfriend during this time. He told me I was selfish and should be ashamed of myself.

Seems like your aunt got there around when you would have anyway and at least she\u2019s local.", "NTA. You were several hours away, and a college student. Also, he texted you a few hours later ... so that sounds like he still would've had to sit in the waiting room for two hours with your siblings. How much would you have changed?\n\nI'm not sure why you were the first, or one of the first, people on his list to watch the kids when you were two hours away. He needed other options lined up, and if you were his first go to, he should've talked with you about it beforehand. Asking you to drop everything last minute because his girlfriend is having a baby that they knew about for several months is so bizarre", "NTA. In any event, he would have had to be in the waiting room for a few hours waiting for you or aunt. \n\nHe (they!) should have been better prepared with LOCAL care options.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility. You were also two hours away, at school, on a school night. They should have had a contingency plan, because early labor can certainly happen!", "YTA. Sounds like an emergency and it was reasonable to ask and be frustrated you couldn\u2019t come through in what was a stressful and scary moment.", "I think it really depends on how early her labor is. A couple days, a week, it's reasonable that she and your father would have arranged short notice childcare for the inevitable labor. If a month or even earlier? Then the request for child care should be regarded as any other unforseen medical emergency, like a car accident. Early labor could definitely result in the death of mom, baby, or both. In that event, it might be easier and more tender for the kids and the dad for the kids to be in the care of a family member they have a personal relationship with.", "I was prepared for a different judgement, but a 2-hour drive just to get back?  NTA.  What did he think he was going to have to do while he waited 2 hours for you?  Their lack of planning does not mean it\u2019s an emergency for you.", "NTA. Your dad and gf needed to have planned out childcare well beforehand. I get that this was unexpectedly early, but that means you would most definitely be in school had she delivered as planned. \n\nAlso, as you stated you\u2019re 2 hours away\u2026 chances are someone else could come earlier at that point.", "NTA", "She was 2 hours away! Was it not possible to get ANYONE closer", "NTA \n\nYou are 2 hours away at school. He could have hired someone or did as he did, wait with kids until someone else who was available showed up.", "Wow. So you\u2019re all grown and away at college and you\u2019re supposed to drop everything and go babysit his new family. . .while his receptacle pops out another one. \n\nOh honey, I don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t let him guilt trip you at all. Not your circus, but  it may be time for you to release the flying monkeys in their general direction. NTA", "NTA you were 2 hours away at college. They should have had a plan in place for this.", "Does your dad pay for your school?", "NTA\n\nIf your dad can't deal with 2 little kids he shouldn't be having another.", "NTA. The person on call for babysitting during later needs to be *local*. A college student two hours away isn\u2019t local.  OP wouldn\u2019t even have gotten there before the aunt could have!", "NTA", "NTA.  His girlfriend, his child, his choice, his problem.  I know it wasn't planned like that, but he has no business (or justification) calling you selfish and blaming you for the situation.", "NTA. You said you couldn't do it.You had valid reasons as yo why not. And even if you didn't, still nta. I'm not a fan of parents using their older children as built in free emergency baby sitters. It breeds resentment.", "NTA. \n\nBabies don't always wait to make an appearance and after a few kids, dad should have seen this as a possibility and made a better plan.", "NTA. His lack of people to help is not your problem.", "Sometimes the AH in the story is so atrocious I question if the post is real.\n\nUnfortunately there are people like your dad out there who are the AH, and I sadly believe every word you have said here\n\n\nYou are NTA.\n\nIf your dad has made commitments that he can't fulfil, then he has overcommitted.  He needs to figure out how he can juggle this mess he has created.\n\nYeah your Dad's life would be easier if you fixed his self created problem for him.\n\nYour dad is diminishing what it would cost you to do this before you even agreed to do it. He isn't even valuing what this arrangement will cost you.\n\nYou Dad appears immature and foolish. You need to look after your own interests as you dad is a child and can't help you.", "YTA, it's an emergency medical situation. You should have helped your family.", "NTA. not your circus and definitely not your monkeys. They should have had already had someone lined up for just such an occasion.", "Nta. Sounds like daddy didn\u2019t prepare. (Which you\u2019d think baby #4 he would have learned how l&d goes/works. He didn\u2019t prepare for childbirth and what to do with the other kids. A lack of planning on his behalf doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on your end.", "NTA.  I presume he knew for months that there was a baby on the way.  They should have had multiple people lined up to watch them in case of different circumstances such as day of week, time of day, etc.", "I think YTA, that is a medical emergency! Some things are just more important and require time and sacrifice.", "NTA for many reasons.\n\n1. You are not local.  2 hours away is a long way.  You have classes as well.  If you really were the only person avaliable, dad could have driven the kids to you.  \n\n2. Does he and the girlfriend have NO ONE LOCAL?  Like, are they so hated by everyone that they have no friends?  Are you seriously it?  I am sorry. That makes me think they ate likely AHs in a larger sense if the answer is yes because they likely abuse those around them including you.", "NTA.  Sounds like they didn't do much planning for this obvious occurrence.", "Nta, who doesn\u2019t have a plan in place for their kids for labor? Plus a back up. I line mine up before i was six month pregnant", "NTA. Look, I am ALL for helping family in an emergency. But, you are 2 hours away. In those 2 hours your father could have called a Nanny service, a neighbor, the teen down the street... \n\nThis was not a case of you just not wanting to or hanging out with your friends. You live 2 hours away, have college classes and are in your first week back on campus in class. You can't just skip a class.\n\nYour Dad had other options that he decided not to use.\n\nIn answer to his angry text, text him this:\n\n\"Dad, I am sorry you felt you didn't have any options. The fact of the matter are that you did and  you did not consider them or you were not willing to use them. You wanted me to miss class my first week back on campus to babysit - that is not an option. You could have called a neighbor, a nanny service, a babysitting service, or your girl friend's circle. Again, you had options but you decided not to use them and instead decided to blame me. I will not accept responsibility for your missing the baby's birth, though I AM sorry you were not able to be there.\"\n\nI'm really really glad you didn't go. Again, I am all for helping family in an emergency under most circumstances but the thing is, it is clear that he thinks of you as his built in sitter and you not showing up this time is going to force him to consider other options.", "Where's girlfriends family? If you are 2 hours away in college then why would you be the expected person to show up? She's been pregnant  for assuming  at least 8 months which means it was known when she was due and would coincide with you starting  school anyway.  Failure to plan on their part doesnt make it your problem. They have 2 other children together  and your dad has at least one more kid (you) so hes been there before and should know that no 2 pregnancies are the same The ones saying  YTA is astounding to me.", "NAH because you can do what you want, but it was an emergency. It\u2019s not like he was asking you to watch them so they could go catch a movie. It was an actual medical emergency. He\u2019s not an ah for asking you. I doubt you focused on your studies that night.", "NTA that would be your dad for expecting you to drop everything at your college on a school night to go babysit your 1/2 siblings especially since you live two hours away presuming that is when traffic is amazing, not backed up.  He can be butthurt all he wants, but they should have done better planning on getting a local sitter versus expecting you to bail from your first week back in classes on a school night to take care of your 1/2 siblings.  \n\nThe irony is that he's the selfish one demanding you to drop everything because he chose to have a fourth child, the third with his current wife. He needs to grow up and stop demanding you to be his free daycare/babysitter and nanny because of his piss poor planning.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad should have spent a little more time sorting out who is available, reached out a little earlier to more than just you and asked people who are closer.", "NTA. Your dads kids are not your responsibility, you told him of your situation why you couldn\u2019t babysit.", "Nta\n\nEveryone in my family that has had a baby while already having children has a plan in place that was discussed *months* ahead of time on who could drop things and watch the kids with a moments notice incase they went into labor. Then doing it last minute shows that don't give a crap about you or your time. \n\nIf they wanted you to watch the kids when she went into labor, that's a discussion they should have had with you at least a month ago.", "YTA,\nThis is the first week of you being back on campus, and you need to adjust? to what? since you said BACK on campus its not like you are a freshman clueless of everything.\n\nFirst week of class you mainly go over the syllabus and I am sure if you went to office hours your professors would understand your situation. Its not like you were going to have a major exam or project or quiz coming up.\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly, those are your SIBLINGS. If someone told me there is no one to watch my siblings during the birth of ANOTHER SIBLING, I would drive 6 hours if needed, let alone two. You let your sibling down even before they were born, not to mention the risks of your other siblings being alone in a waiting room.\n\nedit: kids werent alone, my bad. still, you made your dad be away from his SO during the time she probably needed him by her side the most", "NTA, simply put he\u2019s projecting his frustration and stress onto you.", "You arrange for someone to be around when you are expecting a baby. You can\u2019t just randomly call someone and do this! \n\nWhen I had my baby, we had a backup for my toddler.", ">  *In any event, he would have had to be in the waiting room for a few hours waiting for you or aunt*. \n\nAha!  The crux of the matter.  He didn't want to care for his little children by himself.  \n\nI suspect that he didn't realize it would take OP two hours to arrive, and he probably thought that once there she would deal with the littles until his partner was home again.\n\nNTA", "Who doesn\u2019t have a person and back up for your kids when labor happens?", "The age of the mother in question isn't mentioned... If she's over 40, all the more reason to believe this could be a high risk pregnancy.", "Sure, if the family member consents and is nearby. But a two hour drive away with no discussion previously that she was willing to do that? Nope.", "Interesting question!", "why would this impact the outcome?  I have to see your train of thought, it's her first week of being back on campus in classes during the school week.  She's supposed to drop everything to drive or get a ride to Dear old Dad's home because he and his wifey didn't have a fucking birthing plan in place regardless if the baby came early or not.  What would have happened if his wife had been in labor for 48 hours (yes it does happen) so she wasted two school days at his house because her stepmom is in labor missing classes that unless she has permission from her professors would bite her in the ass.", "Ohhhh now here is the question I need to know the answer to!", ">If your dad can't deal with 2 little kids he shouldn't be having another.\n\nThis is the answer I was looking for.\n\nNTA, OP.", "There was an aunt nearby at least. Is she TA too for not being available? Sometimes having kids means you have to take your kids to the hospital during emergencies. Adding a third child when they can\u2019t get two covered\u2026but that\u2019s not my rodeo. \nShe\u2019s two hours away as is. The parents needed a closer person to begin with. Could take 3 or more hours with traffic to even get to them.", "Why was it emergency situation? Why did they not already have a person line up? Plus a back up?", "So, he would have been in the waiting room for 2+ hours until OP got there.  How is that an improvement?  It\u2019s on the parents to have care arranged.  A college student 2 hours away isn\u2019t an appropriate choice. Especially when you never even asked!", "Really, like she would have been there in time leaving her school, to go babysit because of the piss poor planning of daddy and stepmom.  Parents who have two children, usually don't do an emergency call to someone 2 hours away because they have planned it out.  WTF is his family or his wife's family?", "Exactly!! They already have 2 kids together, they know how this works. You don\u2019t rely on someone who lives 2 hours away, especially without asking first. Easy NTA", "How on earth is it this girl's problem that her father had no plan in place? She didn't get knocked up, and the two siblings are not her responsibility. Parents who force their older kids to take care of their siblings should truly be sterilized. \n\n\nHow exactly was she going to help arriving two hours later? Her aunt showed up, problem solved. Speaks volumes that there's no other friends or family who could have helped.\n\nNTA", "It wasn't an emergency. It was poor planning on his part. He knew she was pregnant and failed to plan for childcare close to when she might give birth.", "You'd think that 2 hours away is not the best person. When you could maybe get a neighbour 2 mins away to watch the kids for someone to pick them up.", "I agree, but dad didn't miss the birth  he just missed a few hours of gfs labour, which he would have done waiting for OP to drive back regardless.", "You need spaces between the Y T A or it'll register as your vote", "It's not necessarily a reasonable assumption that she's been pregnant for 8 months. We really need to know how early the labor is before we make any kind of judgement call.", "Dad thought that someone 2 HOURS away was the best person to call! What about the neighbours 2 MINUTES away. They could probably watch kids while someone came (in this case aunt) for them in emergencies isn't it usually better to get someone who can get there QUICKLY", "Exactly I had 5 layers of back up and if that failed, my husband would have missed the birth to be with our kids. \n\nThe OP is not at fault in any way", "Ffs. You are the a..hole for this comment.  \n  Half siblings for a start.\n  And also, hello,  why didn't the parents have something in place for the kids a bit closer than someone 2 hrs away. \n\nAlso as you have no idea of her studies or what is going on on the campus, shut up.", "Dude has at least 3 kids already and hasn't figured out he needs a plan B for child care?  How many other people were less than 2 hours away at that point?", "Dad could have got a neighbour to watch them until aunt came. Oh and how far away are neighbours 2 mins/5 mins away. AKA could get there ASAP and children probably wouldn't have to go anywhere.", "So? OP is 2 hrs away. Adjusting to what? Trying classes, buying books, getting situated in the dorm, getting any parking stickers or anything else. It\u2019s a new year. All the crap has to be done.", "They weren\u2019t alone, if you would\u2019ve read my dad sat with them. And it was 9 at night, on a school night, I\u2019d have to drive 2 hours. I was still moving my things into my dorm and needed to find my working zone on campus. Obviously someone was never demanded endlessly in life", "Dad and GF should have had someone on standby that lived close by, they've had **months** to prepare.

If you\u2019re gonna be salty about people calling you an AH on this subreddit then idk man xD", "OP you did nothing wrong. NTA. Your dad and his gf needs to plan better if they are on child #3. A twenty year old college student living 2 hours away should not be a responsible parents first choice to call when their partner goes into labor. Child birth can take a long time. I don\u2019t think any older sibling should be obligated to leave school to babysit for an uncertain amount of hours with no notice. They should\u2019ve planned better. That\u2019s on them not you.", "You also have no idea what the rest of their relationship is like, what the relationship is like with the father's new partner, the quality of the roads etc. Not everyone has a positive relationship with their relatives, and not all relatives are family", "If she is dependent on his money for school, he has a great big lever to use against her.  I don't disagree with your assessment, but she needs to realistically evaluate if he would (could) successfully screw her if she refuses.

Professors are human and most of them are reasonable people. for context: I attended a University, and worked at both a private (6k students) and public (30k students) university with faculty directly.\n\nIf you missed a day or two, went to office hours, sat down and talked to them for 15 min, they would understand your situation, and sum up what you missed if needed. \n\n (if they even noticed you weren\u2019t there, if its a large university)"]}
