{"id": 7338, "submission_id": "10bwarh", "title": "AITA for snitching on my brother?", "selftext": "A while back I found a girl from my school crying in the school toilet. I calmed her down and asked her what was up. She confided in me that she's being harassed online because she broke up with one of the upperclassmen. She's been getting very disturbing and some threatening messages from like 50 different accounts on a daily basis and she's tried blocking them but new accounts kept popping up. She doesn't want to tell her parents because he had pictures of her drinking and n\\*\\*es and would make them public. The school is basically useless and has failed victims in the past. When I asked for a name of the guy she broke up with I recognized him as a friend of my brother and thought maybe he could make this stop until I saw one of the accounts with a username he uses as a throw away and for additional free trials and stuff. \n\nThat night I told my parents what I saw and my mom instantly told me that either i was lying or that girl was because my brother wouldn't do anything like that and started going off on me for trying to ruin his life. My father shut that down and called my brother and asked for his phone and laptop. He found a group chats and screenshots where the guys were sharing what they had sent so far and what else should they send. It also contained n\\*\\*es of the girl and them ripping her apart. I had never heard my father raise his voice but that night was something else entirely. Even I got scared. The neighbors even called the cops cause they thought something was wrong. My dad then downloaded the entire chat and deleted any pictures he had of her and contacted all the parents even though it was past 10. They all met up and my dad shared what he had discovered. Except a few parents including my mom who were trying to minimize things, were incredibly angry. \n\nMy dad and the other parents contacted the girls parents the next day. Brought them up to speed and told them how their kids were going to be punished and even apologized to the girl themselves for failing as parents. I heard my dad even cried. My dad would later give her parents a letter from my brother apologizing for his part in this mess if she ever wants it and gave the girl money he got from selling my brother's stuff and what he'd saved up for my brother's car. \n\nMy mom, brother and her entire side of the family is pissed at me right now and have been blaming me for ruining everything and how it will affect his future, which I guess is true. He will have a gap in his school history which colleges would need an answer for. He lost the car he's been dreaming of for years and lost his friends too since they don't want to do anything with the guy whose sister is a snitch. He's pretty sad and lonely now. My parents may also been splitting because my mom defended my brother. Both of them have been blaming me for this too and I guess that is fair. It wasn't really my business and I kind of inserted myself in that girl's life.

Your brother didn't lose this stuff because you spoke up; he lost it because he participated in harassment. Your mom needs to check herself, because she's enabling some seriously disturbing behavior in your brother. \n\nYour dad rocks.", "NTA. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. \nMorally you did the right thing and it's everyone else who messed things up for themselves. \n\nHow bad would you have felt if something had happened to that girl and you hadn't helped her.", "NTA.  \n\nYou might very well have saved her life.  Seriously.  There are numerous instances like you describe that end with the victim committing suicide.  \n\nYou saw someone vulnerable being exploited by others.  Worse than exploited.  You shared what you learned with your parents.  Your snitching was to protect another human being.  That actually makes you the hero in my book.\n\nWhenever you feel sad about what all has happened to those victimizing her, remember what happened to her.  Remember what could have happened to her.  Remember that her live was being ruined.  You helped that.\n\nYes, there are consequences for your brother.  They will be unpleasant.  But don\u2019t believe his entire life is ruined.", "NTA, I\u2019m so proud of your dad. Your mother is being moronic, if this wasn\u2019t your dad\u2019s reaction now, your brother would go on to do this as an adult and she\u2019ll be bailing him out of jail and feeding him cos he can\u2019t get a job, not dealing with a gap on his school record. \n\nI suggest as soon as anyone comes at you about this, you remind them of that fact and ask if they\u2019d be the ones to feed and clothe your brother if he did the same thing in ten years.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s side of the family is clearly playing favorites with your brother and refusing to accept what actually happened. You did the right thing.\n\n(Also, no offense, but if they should be mad at anyone it should be your father, since he was the one who really put his foot down with his brother)", "NTA It really takes a lot of guts to stand up for what is right and if you were my daughter I would be so proud of you.\n\nYes, there is now a bend in your brother's future, but at least he has one. If you had not shut this down, this girl could have been one of the many children ending their own lives, now she also has a future.\n\nEdit: You did not cause the bend in his future, he caused it himself.", "NTA at all. This wasn't snitching in the sense of getting someone in trouble for self gain, but you probably saved this girl from severe and ongoing trauma and who knows what else. What they did was vile and absolutely needed to be called out and the fact that your mother can't see this and blames you instead of your brother is exactly why the cycle continues. Your brother deserved everything he got and you cannot blame yourself for his actions. If only everyone could be a decent person instead of enabling such terrible behaviour.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother got what was coming to him, as well as the other participants involved in the bullying. It's not your fault for exposing him and  \"ruining\" his future, it's his own fault for behaving in such a disgusting and immature way.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is raising a real winner. She will have fun with it in the future I\u2019m sure /s.", "NTA. In fact, you're a star. Your brother and his pals wanted to tear down someone from the anonymity of the net, and you put a stop to it.\nYour dad's NTA.\nYour brother and mother are total assholes, but I suspect you knew that.", "NTA. You saved that young woman from a vicious attack. Your brother and his friends got what they deserved: the predictable consequences of bad behavior.\n\nYour brother should look on the bright side: if the girl was underage you saved him and his friends from possible prison time and a permanent record if the police ever got their hands on that evidence. He and his friends ought to be kissing your feet right now, if they had any common sense.", "NTA. I commend you for standing up for that girl. You knew this would put a lot on yourself and still did the right thing. I think you're dad handled it very well. I would just add that my son would find himself completing his studies in a monastery 1000miles from the closest signs of life.", "NTA! \nLet me say that again, NTA!!! \n\n\nLook, you didn't ruin your brother's life, YOUR BROTHER'S ACTIONS ruined his life.\n\nIf I were your dad, I'd also split from your mom.

Be proud of that!", "NTA, sometimes the right thing to do sucks, but you did it anyway. The assholes are the bullies who were tormenting that girl and they got some of what they deserved.", "NTA. Your brother faced the consequences of his actions. It was a bit extreme of your dad to take away the money, but the boys definitely deserved it. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. If you're a bully, then you definitely deserve to get your life ruined. \n\n\nIt's not your fault, you're not the one who forced your brother to be in that group chat, share those photos and say such mean things. You're not the one who called the parents and had a meeting. You're not the one who asked for a potential divorce. You just stood up for someone being treated unfairly and the bullies faced the consequences of their actions. Obviously they didn't learn their lesson, otherwise they wouldn't be whining about how \"unfairly\" they were treated.", "What the heck.  \n\nNTA, you did the right thing!  Also applauds for your father for doing the right thing.", "NTA - it\u2019s a very tough situation and your dad sounds like a model dad. Could\u2019ve swept it under the rug but owned it completely .\n\nIt\u2019s better to address it early on before it gets worse", "Nope definitely NTA. Your brother is in this situation because of HIS actions. Actions have consequences and these are his!! He actively participated in harassing a girl and it blew up in his face, even if you\u2019re the one who told on him. You did the right thing for sure! The punishment and consequences that your dad fished out were his decision!", "Info: why will he have a gap in his school history?", "NTA - far from it. You are a hero.\n\nThank you for standing up for the young woman being harassed. This is is not \"snitching.\" It is speaking up for someone who was being attacked. If your brother and his buddies physically attacked someone would your mother expect you to stay quiet?\n\nYOU have not \"ruined\" anyone's life. Your brother and his cronies are facing consequences for their own choices.  Your dad and the other parents who confronted this are awesome!", "Nta, also, instead of missing a year, your brother could have been in prison depending on where you live, in the u.s. as a highschooler, sharing nude pictures of highschooler can be considered a felony.", "NTA. Kudos to you and your dad for being stand up people. \n\nIt\u2019s incredible how your mom went from \n- this is heinous, he would never do this to\n- this isn\u2019t a big deal, I\u2019m not upset about it to\n- how dare you stop the abuse of this girl at the expense of my son, the abuser\n\nYou should ask her what you would like to happen to someone if they treated her or you like that. Either way she is an abuse enabler and her opinions on this shouldn\u2019t matter to you. And not that he didn\u2019t earn consequences but plenty of people take a gap year, nobody will care unless he\u2019s charged criminally so the guilt trip angle is pretty weak\n\nYou probably saved more than one woman in the future from the abuse (this pattern of behavior wouldn\u2019t go away or become less intense) and separated your brother from being lifelong friends with abusers. Win, win, win, win", "NTA what if you said nothing? Could you deal with finding out that girl killed herself? Then a few years later finding out your brother had been arrested for something similar? All because you never told your parents? A minor is always told to tell her parents or a trusted adult if something is wrong. You did that. Your parents are fighting because your mother enable her golden child. That is on her, not you.", "NTA \n\nRecently we\u2019ve been learning as a society that it\u2019s not enough to not be racist.  We must be anti-racist where we speak up when we see racism.\n\nThis is the same with bullying.  It\u2019s not enough to not bully.  We have an obligation to stop bullying when we see it.\n\nIt sucks that your brother is a bully and your mother wants to stick her head in the sand.  You and your father did the right thing.", "NTA.  \nI do think this is too private to post on reddit.\n\nEither way you saved a girl from any more harrassment so good on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This isn't a small thing that wouldn't hurt anyone if you were to ignore it. This is an extremely serious issue and I think your dad took the perfect steps.\n\nI know you may care about your brother and feel bad about what you did, but you may never know how much you helped that girl, maybe even saved her life. Things like this have absolutely led down that path before.\n\nI'm sure your brother isn't a bad person and just made a mistake that he didn't realize was so bad, but he needs to learn now.", "NTA. Your brother was in a chat where intimate photos of someone who is presumably a -minor- were shared without her consent. That's a sex crime. Your brother knew this was happening, and said nothing about it to anyone else. He didn't protest. He didn't try and convince his friends what they were doing was wrong. He didn't tell the girl, or his parents, or sock the guy who posted the pictures in the nose. He did nothing to make the situation better. He joined in, he had a laugh. Your brother made his own bed, then he pissed all over it, shat himself in it, and doesn't want to lie down noe. Tough shit, bro. I'm glad your dad took it so seriously. I'm glad you did the right thing and told your parents. Girls have left this earth over this kind of thing, and the boys who do it almost never see consequences. Seriously, you did the right thing at a time when making that choice was super difficult.", "NTA.  You did the right thing, as did yiyr dad.  No one deserves to be harrassed or bullied like that.

You did so good.

It was intense. He would no longer get a car. He now has a flip phone with no internet access.

He made decisions to behave in a way that once caught, there are consequences for.\n\n> He will have a gap in his school history which colleges would need an answer for. \n\nI doubt it.\n\n> He lost the car he's been dreaming of for years\n\nHe hasn\u2019t lost what he never had, at this point it just mean his dream is delayed for a bit. I doubt the financial compensation to his victim really makes up for the torment he and his friends put her through.\n\n> and lost his friends too since they don't want to do anything with the guy whose sister is a snitch.\n\nYou stood up for someone being harrassed. \nNo one should be protecting that behavior - they were hurting someone, and if you had said nothing you would have been complicit.\n\nIt sounds like they don\u2019t have a single ounce of remorse for stalking, harrassing, and threatening this girl.\n\n> He's pretty sad and lonely now. \n\nThis is going to be rough for him. You can acknowledge that without giving space to the idea that they should have been continued to harrass this girl.\n\nYou know this could have ended in her committing suicide, right? This wasn\u2019t just fun games, this was serious shit your brother got himself in involved in. That he CHOSE to be involved in.\n\n> My parents may also been splitting because my mom defended my brother.\n\nThat is not your responsibility. \n\n> Both of them have been blaming me for this too and I guess that is fair. It wasn't really my business and I kind of inserted myself in that girl's life.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not fair. YOU did the right thing. You didn\u2019t cause hurt with your actions; the fallout here is from your brother\u2019s choices.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make your brother make those choices. You told a parent he was hurting someone. *He was hurting someone*.", "NTA and thank you for helping her.", "NTA. OP, your dad is a hero. That\u2019s a good man right there.", "NTA. I'm sooo glad to hear that your dad was handling things to the level it needed. \nThis is not something that should be downplayed,  this  is all your brother and his friends actions,  and actions have consequences.  Better this than a record for harassment,  misconduct,  and even distribution of the pictures.", "NTA - And this internet stranger is SO proud of the amazing human you are! Your dad is a great man too!", "NTA", "You did the right thing, so did your dad.\nWell done to you both!\n\nIt might be best if your parents do get divorced. Your father seems to understand what was wrong, whereas your mother is downplaying it. That's the type of mother who helps her murdere son with an alibi.....", "NTA you 100% did the right thing.  Also depending on where you are at distribution of nudes against a persons permission can be considered a crime so your brother could have ended up with a very lenient lesson.", "What your brother did was indefensible, but surely i am not the only person wondering why you did not go directly to your brother and call him on what he did and insist he do what he could to make it right?\n\nOne of the characteristics of AITA reddit is that almost no one here seems to be bothered by proportionality of penalty. If OP describes someone as doing something wrong (like telling a taboo joke, or having an old-fashioned attitude toward sexuality, or having been an adult associated in any way with a marriage breakup, then there are no limits on the penalty OP is applauded for inflicting. There are examples in recent months of redditors applauding screaming, cursing, calling police, getting someone evicted from their home, fired from their job, expelled from school, having a marriage or relationship broken up, being shunned by family or friends. I will admit i have not seen murder applauded as a penalty for a speech or attitude crime, but i am a relative newbie here. Having said that, i agree with you that he is paying a very high price for participating in group bullying.", "YMBTA I think you should have started by asking your brother to stop this and only if he didn't comply tell your parents. Going behind your brother's back instead of confronting him wasn't kind I would say. That's not what siblings do. You were right to stand for this girl otherwhise, what your brother did was very wrong.", "Yep. OP's dad did what's supposed to  happen if we, as a society, are going to make inroads on the BS misogyny that privileges BuT wHaT aBoUt ThE BuLlY behavior over the harm done BY the bullies.\n\nI get a parent not wanting to believe that their child would be such a complete and utter shit, but right now, your mom is failing your brother hugely by allowing him to see YOU as the problem and not his behavior. Externalizing blame FTW! :/\n\nFar too often - ie, almost all the time - people behave as if *pointing out* bullshit is the problem, not the people who *committed*  (potentially criminal and absolutely harmful) bullshit acts in the first place.\n\nOP, you're in a tough place. Talk to your dad and see whether you can't get the whole family to go to a family counseling session.\n\nNTA", "I was going to say the same thing! Your dad is freaking amazing!", "Respectfully, on the privacy point, I disagree. This kind of shit need to be exposed to the light of day...", "I went to my parents because of how serious the issue felt. There were messages telling her to k\\* herself. How they would find her and r\\* her. And so many more. My brother's were more on the lighter side of things but those messages were scary. I didn't know what to do. Plus the girl's pictures were involved so I thought my parents would be the best people to go to.", "I hate to say this, I genuinely do, but if everyone, aside from your dad, defended your brother, only caring about what revealing his horrid and abusive behavior would do to his reputation, then that family likely was not worth having. \n\nHis behavior was only going to get worse. If it started with this level of bullying, who knows just how bad it could've gotten. If anyone has even a shred of common sense, hopefully someone will be able to get your brother help to understand why what he did was wrong. Otherwise... well, it wasn't going to get better.", "Family who have no problems with what your brother did. What if it had been you in that situation?? I know that doesn't help because feelings aren't rational and they're still your family. Even though you aren't at fault it was still your actions that seem to have broken up your family (but remember that it was your brother! He could've prevented this shit storm by not being a massive dick). Hopefully you'll be getting some sort of therapy since I can't imagine the emotions that you must be feeling. \n\nYour dad sounds wonderful though. I hope he is and that you'll get the needed support from him.\n\nYou and him both rock!", "INFO: you said in your post both yur parents are blaming you for their issues? Why?", "Ever hear of Amanda Todd?\n\nThat is what happens to people who don't get help. \n\nYou helped her and highlighted a serious issue, harassment.", "You have your dad. A dad who you know will fight for you tooth and nail to make sure no one ever tries to harm you the way this girl was harmed. That's the family you need. Not family who don't care that a girl was being sexually harassed and bullied every single day. That's family that you can never rely on or trust.", "So, first off, I hope the therapist your dad has set up also means you go to therapy as well. If not, maybe ask your dad if you can. This is a lot to work through. I think you would benefit from a therapist that can help you work through what you\u2019re feeling.\n\nSecond, your father\u2019s punishment was big but I think called for given the severity of what he did. It\u2019s good your dad set up a therapist for him because your brother has some things to work through if this was his behavior. All of this pales in comparison to what could have played out, and don\u2019t let your mom or brother or your mom\u2019s side of the family make you think otherwise; your brother\u2019s actions could have cost that girl\u2019s life and you\u2019re a saint for speaking up. You did the right thing. And your brother could have been walking down a much darker path. You helped that girl, you helped your brother, and hopefully through therapy, your brother will eventually see what he did was wrong and realize you weren\u2019t the problem. Hopefully he\u2019ll find a healthier life after this is all over. \n\nI know this is so hard because it\u2019s family, but remember\u2026you didn\u2019t do those things to that girl, your brother did. You aren\u2019t the one defending his actions, your mother did. You\u2019re not the one who stood firm in defense of some heinous things your brother did and put a divide between your parents, your mother did. You did nothing but the RIGHT thing. Even though it might not feel like it at times, please try to remember that you and your father are good people.", "Your dad is an awesome parent who succeeded in raising you as an honorable person and who is trying to ensure that your brother is an honorable person as well. You should be proud of both him and yourself. Your mother is setting a terrible example for your brother and should be ashamed of herself.", "But to people on the internet that don't know anything about their family and can't do anything? Besides, if I was that girl I wouldn't want anyone else knowing. I respect your opinion though.", "No just my mom and brother are blaming me. My dad said I did the right thing.", "He didn't want him to try and take any revenge on the girl at school and because it would've been pretty bad for her to still see her \"abuser\" walking around. Moreover, it made the girl and her parent's happy as it ensure her safety. I don't know all the details but there were talks of legal action", "tend to agree since it would be better that he be homeschooled now, but I dont think it feasible for the family. Dad probably doesnt want the son to return to his behaviour", "I see where you're coming from, but there's not enough here to dox anyone?", "You did do the right thing. That girl could have killed herself. If you didn\u2019t tell anymore Knowing what your brother/ his friends did would you be able to forgive yourself.", "oh okay i must have misread. No you did nothing wrong and you know it. You are at this school and you've seen this happen to other girls. Your dad did the right thing and im suprised the other parents followed him on this as well. How did that go down btw?", "At first thought I agreed with the person you're replying to but thinking further, your dad's actions make sense. The last years of high school can be really difficult to pass if you miss more than a few weeks and he'd probably miss longer than that trying to transfer to a new school this year. If it was purely as punishment it would be the wrong move but this was a case of protecting the victim.", "You have a fair point. However, you have to remember the poor girl is already embarrassed and traumatized, trying to forget what happened- and then suddenly sees this, describing everything that happened. She must feel bad knowing strangers now know about this traumatizing event.", "Yeah, the wording leading into the \"both\" statement was a bit confusing in context."]}
