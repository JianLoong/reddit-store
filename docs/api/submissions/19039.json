He had already dropped out of school and was working full time in an apprenticeship and had another part time job. He agreed to the terms happily.

At this point, 23 Sis is older than you were when you assumed custody and so much financial burden at such a young age.\n\nAs you say, as time passes, your brother is no longer a minor and is increasingly an adult in the household -- so if he wants to continue to be in the household, it does make sense he would pay rent. Parents with adult children at home charge them rent all the time, so I don't understand why people would  give you (a sibling, still relatively young yourself, trying to support all these brothers!) a hard time for this.\n\nI'm leaning towards NTA.", "NTA if he is earning more it makes sense for him to pay more, especially since it is still less than what he would pay by renting his own place", "INFO: Is your sister just criticizing you, or is she being helpful in some other way?\n\nPersonally, I think you should not increase his rent above the proportion of what the new rent is to the old. But, instead, stipulate he needs to open a retirement investment account that gets monthly contributions.", "NTA - you are supporting 3 younger siblings. What is the sister doing about this? She could help, too.", "NTA - how can you be acting like your \u201cdeadbeat\u201d parents and yet raising their other children? Seems like, to act like them, you\u2019d have to pass off the responsibility to your sister.", "NTA cost of living has jumped dramatically in the last few years so asking the other adult in the house to help seems only logical. It's not like you are seeking to profit from him. I don't see why your sister is complaining, it's not like your siblings are your children, sounds like you are doing an admirable job in a bleak situation.", "NTA - And I would say since your brother isn't a minor and can therefore live where he wants, tell your sister that if she can let him move in have him living for free at her own place. I'm guessing her tune will change.", "NTA, he chose to work full time so time to pay his way. If he was going to school full-time then I could understand him not paying full price. Tell your sister if she wants a say then she can contribute to the household.", "Info: how much are you making in comparison to him? And to confirm, he isn\u2019t under you custody anymore, right?", "NTA, if the young man wants to be an adult then he needs to contribute fairly.  Given you have assumed custody of your then minor siblings, that speaks to your character.  Given you are quite young yourself, the burden should not be yours to bear alone.  If your sister has something to say, then she should pony up to help you... clearly she isn't so therefore she has no input into this.", "NTA. You are not his parent. It\u2019s not your job to shelter him from reality. Grownups have to pay rent", "NTA. If your sister has a problem with it she should volunteer to take over the responsibility of your younger siblings. (Edit:typo)", "NTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t like utilities and rent haven\u2019t gone up over the last year. If he wants to live, like everyone else, you need to pay the bills. Why would the increase fall solely on your hands if there is another working adult?", "NTA your brother is 19, not 9 and has been an adult for a year. I'm assuming when brother # 2 turns 18 he too will be picking up part of the rent. Since your sister has shouldered none of the financial responsibility I have no idea why she even has an opinion", "Definitely NTA. It's time for the 19 y.o. to learn how the real world works.", "YTA he doesn\u2019t have custody. YOU have custody, YOU are responsible, not him.\n\nVery clever of you to veil the real reason you want him to pay more in your post. If you want to raise his rent, you can do that as long as it is legal, do look that up, but drop the reasoning that it\u2019s because you want him to help pay for your responsibilities.", "YTA\n\nYou got custody, which in turn means you're the parent of this children. The 19 year is not responsibly for helping provide for his siblings like you're arguing.  Let him save up money so he can move out on his own and grow as an adult. Stop parentyfying your brother into helping care for his siblings.\n\nNow, I want to add that yes, he's and adult with a job. He should be contributing a little to help pay for the apartment/home. However, upping his contribution post-agreement is an AH move. When renting an apartment from someone, and you get a better paying job during the lease, the landlord cannot just decide to up your rent because you can, \"afford to pay more.\" That's not how this works.\n\nEdit: Okay, so I\u2019m going to add this here since I didn\u2019t convey my stance better and don\u2019t want to reply to every comment; and since those comments seem to be spiraling into entirely irrelevant tangents.\n\nOP is not TA for wanting to raise 19\u2019s rent and contributions to the household. However, OP is TA for doing it out of the wrong reasons and circumstances. \n\nOP is citing the reasons as being to \u201cprovide for their siblings.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, but who has custody of the children? OP does, not 19. It is not 19s responsibility to provide for those not in their custody. They are not 19s responsibility.\n\nThe other reason being 19 suddenly got a better paying job and now suddenly he is obligated to give more of his money to the household. Absolutely not. OP doesn\u2019t get to suddenly change the agreed upon contribution due to some windfall.\n\nI can promise you if 19 was some random stranger renting the room everyone\u2019s tune would change here. But just because they happen to be related by blood it\u2019s suddenly okay for OP to demand more money out of them. Nah, f that noise.

So if that means raising rent or getting a different renter who will pay market value rent for the room, then he can and maybe even should do that in order to suppor the kids under his custody. In the comments he says he's only making 35K, so OP is probably straining pretty hard to actually provide for these youngest two children he's responsible for. At this point, since the other bro and sis are adults, OP just does not have the same responsibility help subsidize them that he does to steward things in such a way to be able to support the two minor custodial brothers.", "If he would raise it to an absurd high level I would agree with you, but a lot of parents expect their adult children to contribute according to their means. 350 of more than 2000 a month is not parentyfying him. \n\n\nA landlord can pretty regularly decide to up the rent- if you earn more or not.

For most people living is 33% or more of their income.", "That's not the vibe I'm getting. It sounds like OP would be okay with his 19 year old brother moving out and paying his own separate adult life. (Sounds like that's what the adult sister in between is already doing). So it doesn't seem like OP is trapping him there. Presumably OP could rent the room to somebody else who will pay market value, and then OP would have more income to support the rest of his brothers who actually are his custodial responsibility to support.", "19 is old enough to move out and be an adult  or pay rent- OP got the responsibility of raising his siblings and keeping the family together simply because of his age, nothing more. He did his duty above and beyond, supporting his siblings is not an open ended situation and shouldn't be treated as such.

Like you said, it's \"hard-core.\" \n\nThe reason I say \"parentyfying\" is because of the arguments OP is using to justify this are completely wrong, which is why I believe they are the AH.\n\nAnd a landlord cannot simply raise rent midlease unless it's something like a month-to-month lease.", "Completely irrelevant. OP and the brother agreed on an amount brother would contribute. OP is ONLY bringing this up because brother is now making more money and using the argument that it would \"help provide for their siblings.\"\n\nIf OP wants the brother to contribute more, then OP should get the brother to sign the lease agreement alongside them. After all, they're both adults, right?", "He WAS a minor who should not have been paying rent to his custodial parent/guardian.", "I do not expect someone who agreed to get custody of three minor children to expect any of those minor children to financially support the household.", "Then OP shouldn\u2019t have agreed to be his legal guardian.", "Then you were wrong to charge him rent when he was a minor. It\u2019s okay to charge him rent as an adult but you should only be charging him the cost of his room, not trying to get him to subsidize the cost of the kids.", "It\u2019s not legal for a landlord to raise rent because they want to buy something personal with the money, what court would recognize that?", "How can it not be the vibe you are getting when it is explicitly stated as such in the post?\n\nOP says he wants 19 to help provide for his younger sublings. 19 got a tiny windfall in the form of a better job and that\u2019s the whole reason OP wants more money and OP is using the reasoning that 19 should provide for his siblings. Sister is right. It\u2019s exploitation.", "Maybe I'm missing something. In your case or similar situations, what was preventing you from leaving?\n\nI think 19 yr old brother CAN move out, but evidently he is choosing not to because it's still in his own financial best interest to stay get below-market rent. If he wants and can afford to live independently, presumably he would do so... After all, it sounds like 23 Sister has been doing precisely that.\n\nYes, OP does say that he wants to use the rental income to support his other dependent brothers, but why is that worse than if a landlord had a renter and use the income to buy himself video games, baseball tickets, or anything else? I think most landlords use the rental income as, well, income, that they put towards their own desires or dependents, so that doesn't seem all that surprising or damning to me. I just don't see much evidence that OP is trying to fleece his brother to go hire hookers or something. If he's only making 35K as he says in a comment, then he likely really just trying to cover basics, and it's hardly wrong to use rental income (whether from a relative or a randomn unrelated renter) to do that.", "There is month-to -month and there are yearly renew leases. Both would be up now.\n\n\nThe brother doesn't have a \"you are bound forever because you are my brother\" lease.\n\n\nThe brother doesn't even pay 18% of his income as rent. It is still a great deal for him. Most people pay 33% or more.", "It really isn't irrelevant. OPs expenses have probably increased a lot in the last couple years like they have for most people.

It would be different if he stayed in school.", "You have a weird mentality that, in a situation of mostly deadbeat and absent figures, you opt for criticizing the sole person in this family who seems to be trying to take responsibility and care for others.", "What is your beef? On the one hand you want OP to cover his brother's financials even though OP is under serious strain raising all these brothers at such a young age himself. On the other hand, you want OP to have abandoned his 17 yr old brother and you think he should have just dropped the rope rather than be legal guardian? Like, are you trying to sink the raft for these guys?", "We don\u2019t know any of the subtext around how that happened. As I see it (and I told my kids the same thing when they were that age), if they choose to drop out of school, they must have a job and pay part of the bills. And for me, it would have been a percentage relative to how many people lived in the house. (For instance, if there were five people, the one in question would be responsible for 20% of the bills.) \n\nFor me, it disincentivized dropping out of school, and taught a valuable lesson in paying your way. Plus, it was WAY cheaper than renting their own place.", "If he made the decision to drop out of school, then he can get a job and pay rent. It would be a whole different story if he didn't drop out of school.", "Maybe it works differently in differert countries? I'm in the USA and our landlords raise rent all the time for all kinds of reasons, but usually rising costs/property taxes/inflation -- and renters either have to pay the new lease rent or move elsewhere. In your country, do landlords have to get some kind of court approval to raise the rent? I've never heard of that, I admit! But I'm intrigued to know that it could work so differently.", "And there was a whole lot else in the post too about 19 deciding to stay because it was actually to his benefit to get below-market rent. Both at 17 and at 19, this brother seems to have chosen to stay because it was actually in his own best interest to do so.\n\nI guess I am not inclined to use OP's hopes for the income (supporting his brothers) against him. Presumably, a landlord could want and could put renter income towards all kinds of purposes-- to gamble, to go to Disneyland, to buy an Xbox, and it seems not realliy relevant for us to judge 'why' he wants the income for the household. I rented for a long time, and I have no idea what my landlords put my rent payments towards in their lives!! So in the big scheme of things, putting the rent towards support of one's younger brothers seems like not that evil or selfish of a rationale.", "When I turned 18, I was pretty much cut off financially aside from my phone line. I had to pay my own rent for the house, which amounted to $400 a month, my own car insurance, gas, food, etc on top of also going to college.\n\nI was only making around $1000 / month. This made it extremely difficult to move out on my own into an area where the median rent at the time was about $1000 for a single bedroom apartment. It took me 4 years to finally squander enough money to leave and I had to fight my mother for the phone PIN to have my number transferred to my own carrier as my number was tied to many important accounts and recovery methods.", "Then nobody should be making any judgements on the post at all by that logic.", "He\u2019s not trying to take responsibility, he\u2019s trying to pawn responsibility off on someone who doesn\u2019t share that responsibility.", "No beef. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable to put financial burdens on minors after you have agreed to carry their financial/legal burdens.", "Also, in which comment did I state I wanted literally any of that?", "We absolutely know that OP agreed to take custody, what are you talking about?", "Did the state still include him as a minor child in their calculation of how much support to give you when he dropped out?", "I meant in the US. Your landlord has to have a legal reason to raise your rent, they can\u2019t do it because they want a new xbox.", "Yeah of course there was a whole lot else in the post, OP is trying to make themselves out to be the good guy. Wonder if he\u2019s getting any money from having custody that he\u2019s willing to share with 19.", "It sounds like there are two different kinds of difficulties here:\n\n>I had to fight my mother for the phone PIN to have my number transferred to my own carrier as my number was tied to many important accounts and recovery methods.\n\nThat first difficulty was mother-induced, and was a very problematic and abusive manipulation  on your mother's part.

This made it extremely difficult to move out on my own into an area where the median rent at the time was about $1000 for a single bedroom apartment.\n\nThis difficulty was not parentally induced, but was just a function of you not making enough income to survive independently yourself.

If 19 doesn\u2019t want to help he doesn\u2019t have to, but he also doesn\u2019t get to keep living almost rent free. Good grief some people here are really grasping", "Why do you keep implying that I want literally anything in this scenario?

If everyone always agreed, this sub wouldn\u2019t exist, and we would have to find something productive to do with our time.\n\nEDIT: wording", "I really don't see why. With OP's strain to support his remaining dependents, it seems to me like OP's other option is just to kick out this adult brother and get a renter who will pay area-normal market rents, which would make his own life trying to fulfill his fiscal responsibility to his remaining minor dependents a lot easier. And you're calling him an asshole for not doing that?\n\nAnyways, this feels like a stupid conversation with people, like the 23 yr old Sister, who just want to bash OP for trying to do his best in a crummy situation while they offer no better solution or aide to help.
