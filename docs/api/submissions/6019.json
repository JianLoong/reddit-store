She brought a gift for the baby, which I thought was really nice.  However, when I opened the gift, it was a book called 'The Baby Owner's  Manual' with a bunch of jokes and sarcastic comments about parenting. I  was really offended and upset by this because I take my role as a parent  very seriously and I don't appreciate being made fun of. When I  confronted her about it, she just laughed and said it was a joke and I  shouldn't take it so seriously. I told her that I didn't find it funny  and that I didn't appreciate her giving my newborn nephew a 'gag gift.'  My husband and brother sided with her and said I was overreacting. AITA  for getting upset about this?\n\nEdit:\n\nHey everyone, I just wanted to give an update on the situation with my sister-in-law and the 'gag gift' she gave my newborn nephew. After I posted about it, I received a lot of feedback from people who pointed out that I was in the wrong.\n\nI realized that I was being overly sensitive and that I shouldn't have gotten upset about a harmless joke. My sister-in-law meant no harm and was just trying to be funny, and I shouldn't have taken it so seriously. I apologized to her and my husband and brother for my reaction, and we were able to move past it.\n\nI also realized that I need to work on not taking myself so seriously as a new parent. Parenting is hard and stressful, and it's important to be able to laugh at ourselves and not take everything too seriously.\n\nI overreacted and should have just laughed it off.

Of course parenting is serious in general, but you're in for a long life if you take *yourself* so seriously. You are going to make mistakes while parenting.

It\u2019s a bit of fun and I\u2019m sure they will be giving lots of love and gifts to the baby in the years to come. I still read the book today and have a laugh at it.", "YTA, I can almost guarantee that she thought everyone would  get a kick out of it and in normal circumstances everyone would.

I understand the stress but you really should not take this so seriously.", "YTA\n\nIt was a harmless joke and you need to lighten up.

Maybe SIL understands that you need a sense of humor when raising kids.", "Yes YTA. Congrats on the baby! But you definitely overreacted to something that was suppose to make you laugh and smile. Parenting is very hard, no doubt about it, and you\u2019re still deal with about of hormones and you body changing, but don\u2019t take *yourself* too seriously! You can take parenting seriously all you want but if you get his upset over something so little, you\u2019re gonna be in for a very long road ahead of you!!", "YTA and sound like a load of fun at parties...", "Yta- calm down. It\u2019s a joke. Moms need to laugh too. Seems like you could use a laugh.", "Oh ffs, YTA and need to lighten up.", "YTA. You need to learn to laugh if you plan to survive parenthood.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re going to get a lot of off hand comments and unsolicited advice as a parent, from everyone you see everywhere. You\u2019re going to need to practice some boundaries to realize it\u2019s not about you, but about them and just let these things go without it effecting you. \n\nBest of luck and congrats!", "YTA, lighten up.\n\nEdit: If you have this same attitude with your child then they'll be on here talking about dealing with thier AH mom.", "YTA but it\u2019s understandable.  Hormones after birth are no joke and little comments that seem to poke fun at the baby and parenting can seem like a big deal.  I remember snapping at my brother when I was in the hospital right after delivery because he said my baby\u2019s first words would be \u201csup dawg\u201d. I wanted to scratch his eyes out.  17 years later, I can acknowledge that perhaps it wasn\u2019t the hugely offensive thing it felt to me at that moment! \n\nCongrats on the new baby!", "As a new mom, YTA lol. Like, I understand parenting is definitely a huge deal. But shes right, you have to lighten up. It was a good intentioned gift. Nobody was doing anything with ill will and you treated them like they called you a bad parent or some shit. If i got that gift, personally i probably wouldve enjoyed it. You didnt even have to like it, just not be rude", "YTA. Chill out. It\u2019s not a gag gift, it\u2019s a baby care advice book written like an instruction manual. I bought it for myself when I was pregnant with my son.", "YTA and you sound exhausting. It\u2019s not a joke book. It\u2019s a lighthearted self help book about having a baby. It has legitimate tips.", "YTA. It was meant to be a joke and you even know that. Her gift has nothing to do with your parenting and I don\u2019t think someone giving a gift like that thinks you don\u2019t take parenting seriously. Lighten up.", "YTA", "YTA-Sometimes the one who needs to laugh the most are the parents. No one is making fun of your parenting abilities by giving a gag gift.", "YTA. \n\nIf you'd actually read the book rather than just skimmed and got offended, you'd know that it actually IS a very practical parenting book that's a bit tongue-in-cheek. It doesn't make fun of new parents, but is meant to break down all the overwhelming \"new baby\" information into something more easily digestible that also entertains along the way. \n\nAnd unless you have the most advanced newborn the world's ever seen, the book was not for your baby, it was for you and your husband. \n\nAlso, if you birthed the child, he is your son - NOT your nephew. For someone who is taking parenting so seriously, you'd think you'd at least get that most basic thing correct.", "I am going with NAH but you were clueless.\n\nRead a page every day and when it starts to be funny to you, you are cured.  Then you can apologize for your reaction .", "I mean... I own this book. Gifted it to my husband when I got pregnant.\n\nI think you very much overreacted here.", "I'm confused. I looked up the book, which is billed as the answer to every parents' question, \"Doesn't this thing come with an owner's manual?\"  Is that the book you're talking about?\n\nI looked at a preview of the book, and it seems like it has some good information; general maintenance, growth and development, bonding with baby, and medical maintenance. (It has everything from asthma to vomiting!) \n\nIf that's the same book, I think you may need a nap, and then take a better look at the book. I know new parents tend to be a bit defensive of their parenting skills (and you admit you're taking it very seriously,) but this book is just tongue-in-cheek advice written by two doctors!\n\nSoft YTA, and INFO: Is there something deeper here? Does SIL have a habit of disparaging your efforts to do things?", "YTA\n\nIf she made an evil laugh and showed you the middle finger while you were opening the gift then it's a different story, but it feels like she was really making a harmless joke. It's not that unusual either.", "Oh dear.\n\nThe book isn't designed to poke fun. It's supposed to be amusing and informative in a light-hearted way, and in no way a reflection of how seriously you take parenting.\n\nI think what you need to do is first take a deep breath. Clearly you're tired and probably stressed from caring for a newborn, but that doesn't negate the fact you overreacted and were rude towards your SIL. Therefore you should understand that she wasn't criticising you as a parent and apologise to her.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nParenting is hard. We all start out with these lofty goals and in reality most of us realize they come out how there going to come out and we do our best to keep them alive and not fuck them up so that they stay good humans who make the world better. \n\nThe first few weeks are hard but nothing compared to the rest of parenthood. You will need that book and those jokes.\n\nIf you hold on to taking everything so seriously you will really struggle as a parent. Let go of that shit now. Your going to have to roll with the punches, the puke, the urine, the crayon on the walls and the freaking glitter or whatever crafty shit your kid gets into when they are older.  Never mind once they have their own opinions and activities. \n\nPut the book away until you aware you have passed the super uptight first time parent stage and then read it and it will probably be hilarious and exactly what you need.\n\nEdited to add - It\u2019s a gift for you, not the baby, something to help you get through the trauma of parenthood, not another onesie that probably won\u2019t even be worn before the kid grows out of it, so it was actually incredibly sweet of her to be thinking of something that would help you and lighten up the mental drain on you instead of just bringing something  little toy or clothes that the baby doesn\u2019t actually need.  I\u2019m going to guess your SIL has kids, or has enough close friends with kids to have a better clue as to what your going to be going through than you do and would suggest you work on repairing whatever damage you did to the relationship because your going to need her. It takes a village.", "YTA. Your baby can't read. I am thinking this is your first child? Once you get some experience under your belt with your baby, I feel those jokes will become relatable and funny. It is fine that you don't find it funny but your reaction was over the top.", "I\u2019m really confused. Did you have a baby with your brother???", "YTA. I'm not one to defend gag gifts, but this isn't a gag gift. It is a humorous book to make you laugh. She thought you would like it and get some laughs from actually reading it. \n\nThe fact that you took this as an insult says more about you than it does about her. Maybe it isn't your cup of tea, but it doesn't mean she was making light of raising a child. If anything, the book is the opposite.\n\nLong Answer:\nHaving a baby is stressful, and rasining kids can be absurd at times, no matter how serious you are about parenting or how good a parent you are. There will be times you do or say something ridiculous or just look at your kid and want to throw your hands up. Having a sense of humor about all of the beautiful, strange, bizzare, infuriating, terrifying, eye opeining, heart-warming, pride-inducing and love-feeling moments you are going to go through for the rest of your life will make you a better parent and well has help you keep your sanity during the difficult times and help you roll with the punches. Being able to know others feel all those things is also really helpful and is great for your mental health when you are in a rough spot, and you will be in rough spots. \n\nRaising a child is serious business, but that doesn't mean there isn't humor in what you go through day to  day. \n\nShort Answer:\nOne day, after multiple days of little sleep, you will get a little bit of time to yourself. You will take a good shower and put on something nice to feel human again. You will go back to your baby, pick him/her up and place them gently on your shoulder to burp them. Suddenly, your hair and back will be covered in luke-warm, smelly, baby throw-up. At that moment, you'll realize you are going to need a bigger sense of humor to get through raising a child.", "NAH.   \nI know that guide and it's actually hilarious. \n\nShe wasn't making fun of you, but you have the right to feel how you feel so if this is really that ofensive to you then nobody has the right to tell you you shouldn't feel that way.\n\nThis judgement is made on the assumption that you addressed this is a calm manner and she didn't know you well enough to get to the conclusion it would make you feel bad.", "NAH, \n\nyou just need to relax a bit, nobody says that you shouldn't take parenting seriously, but just because someone makes jokes about babies or parents/parenting that doesn't mean that they don't take it seriously as well.\n\nwe all deal with things differently. \n\nthat and you will have to soon enough (if you haven't already) have to deal with unsolicited advice stories anecdotes and lots more. \n\nBe a duck and let it all roll of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
