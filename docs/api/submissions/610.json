Lately, she\u2019s been treating me poorly (not being an outward jerk, just not caring about me), but it wasn\u2019t a big deal because we were drifting apart and only kept the BFF title for old times sake. She had been complaining about another friend, \u2018Sara\u2019, who she said was being a complete jerk to her. She had her mom call my mom to complain about Sara, who is an actual child (I just put that in here because I think that\u2019s wrong). However, the thing she was complaining about was something I was there for, and Sara didn\u2019t do anything malicious, and simply forgot something that wasn\u2019t the biggest of deals.   \n\n\nIt was Sara\u2019s birthday yesterday, and Maya said she would show up but then bowed out because \u2018she was tired\u2019. Sara then showed me some texts to Maya, where she apologized (even though she did nothing wrong) in more than three paragraphs because she wanted to maintain the friendship. The texts Maya sent back were completely manipulative and really cruel, which made me so sad because Maya has been my friend for years. I then told Sara about why Maya was upset (because she hadn\u2019t told Sara, she just iced her out and expected her to grovel without knowing). I also told her about how I had similar experience, and helped her draft ideas of what she could say to Maya to explain her feelings. I did ask to be left out of the conversation when they had it, because I didn\u2018t want to gang up on Maya and was interested in speaking to her by myself. \n\nDid I do something wrong by gossiping? Was it even gossiping if it wasn\u2019t done to hurt Maya? I feel I should also note that three years ago, Sara and I had huge problems where we were bullying each other because we were jealous of each other\u2019s relationship with Maya.
