We have a backyard parking lot in the small building I live in and the the ground is covered with concrete grid pavement (has holes with grass in between).\n\nI was away from home for a few weeks and also purchased a new car. This car is significantly bigger than my last and extremely hard to park, especially with the small and awkwardly spaced parking lot. It\u2019s not straight lines like at a grocery store. The builder worked around the weirdly shaped building and the gazebo so the parking spots are all over the place so every apartment can have one.\n\nWell, the morning I came back I received a text that I had run over the kid\u2019s project garden for the summer. I was confused because I was sure I hadn\u2019t gone near any of the small patches of dirt we have for planting. I went on the balcony and did see that there were crumpled plants on the left of my parking spot. The plants however were planted in between the grid pavement. I texted back that their makeshift garden was quite literally on the pavement meant for cars to go over. They told me that I can avoid running it over.\n\nI tried for a few days but ultimately one night in the dark I ran some of them over again. They painted white lines but again one night in the dark I ran it over. Next step my neighbours took was to put potted plants to surround it, and guess what I ran over the pots late at night.\n\nAt this point one guy called me downstairs and gave me a 10minute lecture how to park without doing it. I told him to respectfully f-off and move the plants next to his parking spot. My spot is so awkward, and there is a huge car on the right, so in the dark, when in doubt I am driving over the plants as opposed to damaging the car next to me. He got really livid and we got into a huge argument. \n\nSome people suggested they install lights so I can see better at night and avoid the plants but honestly even in the daylight I have to spend 10minutes manoeuvring and getting out the car to make sure the garden is okay. I don\u2019t wanna do that. I said no and told them I would run over the plants again and they should move. A lot of the people called me an a-hole.

I looked at the picture that Op tried to create, and although it\u2019s cute, it\u2019s still hard to tell what\u2019s going on. As a result, I took all the other explanations in text to come up with what I wrote above. A parking lot is still a road, and as stated by OP, they put the plants in the gaps in the pavement where vehicles drive. A direct quote: \u201cI went on the balcony and did see crumbled plants to the left of my parking spot. The plants however *were planted in the grass between the grids in the pavement*. Which means that, no, it isn\u2019t in a garden. It\u2019s in the pavement. A pavement in which cars are designated to park on. \n\nI think we\u2019re assuming a lot about OP because they ran over some plants. I\u2019d also run over plants if they were in my way. See, when I was imagining OPs situation, I imagined a regular parking lot with regular, straight lines. Then, a larger curb where there were gaps that they put plants in. Plants that could be missed if you tried. I still decided that Op wouldn\u2019t be the asshole regardless because they have a designated place to put plants and decided not to do that. It\u2019s also possible they have a balcony like Op and could put plants there too but did not. Also, this isn\u2019t at all what\u2019s happening - plus, I\u2019ve seen semis take out curbs/run into grass and I\u2019ve seen large trucks park on curbs of grassy medians. It happens. \n\nYou\u2019re right, they aren\u2019t in the wrong if they put plants in the garden. They just aren\u2019t.

If they want to, great. If not, oh well. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re so insistent on calling OP a liar? Did you and Op have a secret beef? It baffles me honestly. You must be a parent to disrespectful kids or something because I never would\u2019ve thought to put plants in a road as a kid. It\u2019s stupid as fuck.

I've seen some things like that, the holes are tiny 5x5 cm spaces. It's not for planting.", "If you read what op posted, it\u2019s abundantly clear that it\u2019s on the pavement. It has been explicitly stated several times that it\u2019s on pavement partly obscuring a driveway.", "If it's a condo rather than an apartment, which sounds like it may be the case, $15k is not an unusual amount to pay for a designated spot in a city. It's basically a separate piece of real estate that is lumped in with your home mortgage. Paying $15k in a city for your parking spot in no way means someone is wealthy, or at least no more wealthy than anyone else who can afford to buy at the moment. \n\nI live in a major city and often torture myself with property prices. That is standard for a parking space, depending on the neighborhood."]}
