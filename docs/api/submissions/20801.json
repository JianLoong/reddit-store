We have a backyard parking lot in the small building I live in and the the ground is covered with concrete grid pavement (has holes with grass in between).\n\nI was away from home for a few weeks and also purchased a new car. This car is significantly bigger than my last and extremely hard to park, especially with the small and awkwardly spaced parking lot. It\u2019s not straight lines like at a grocery store. The builder worked around the weirdly shaped building and the gazebo so the parking spots are all over the place so every apartment can have one.\n\nWell, the morning I came back I received a text that I had run over the kid\u2019s project garden for the summer. I was confused because I was sure I hadn\u2019t gone near any of the small patches of dirt we have for planting. I went on the balcony and did see that there were crumpled plants on the left of my parking spot. The plants however were planted in between the grid pavement. I texted back that their makeshift garden was quite literally on the pavement meant for cars to go over. They told me that I can avoid running it over.\n\nI tried for a few days but ultimately one night in the dark I ran some of them over again. They painted white lines but again one night in the dark I ran it over. Next step my neighbours took was to put potted plants to surround it, and guess what I ran over the pots late at night.\n\nAt this point one guy called me downstairs and gave me a 10minute lecture how to park without doing it. I told him to respectfully f-off and move the plants next to his parking spot. My spot is so awkward, and there is a huge car on the right, so in the dark, when in doubt I am driving over the plants as opposed to damaging the car next to me. He got really livid and we got into a huge argument. \n\nSome people suggested they install lights so I can see better at night and avoid the plants but honestly even in the daylight I have to spend 10minutes manoeuvring and getting out the car to make sure the garden is okay. I don\u2019t wanna do that. I said no and told them I would run over the plants again and they should move. A lot of the people called me an a-hole.
