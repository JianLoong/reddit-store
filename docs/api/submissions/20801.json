We have a backyard parking lot in the small building I live in and the the ground is covered with concrete grid pavement (has holes with grass in between).\n\nI was away from home for a few weeks and also purchased a new car. This car is significantly bigger than my last and extremely hard to park, especially with the small and awkwardly spaced parking lot. It\u2019s not straight lines like at a grocery store. The builder worked around the weirdly shaped building and the gazebo so the parking spots are all over the place so every apartment can have one.\n\nWell, the morning I came back I received a text that I had run over the kid\u2019s project garden for the summer. I was confused because I was sure I hadn\u2019t gone near any of the small patches of dirt we have for planting. I went on the balcony and did see that there were crumpled plants on the left of my parking spot. The plants however were planted in between the grid pavement. I texted back that their makeshift garden was quite literally on the pavement meant for cars to go over. They told me that I can avoid running it over.\n\nI tried for a few days but ultimately one night in the dark I ran some of them over again. They painted white lines but again one night in the dark I ran it over. Next step my neighbours took was to put potted plants to surround it, and guess what I ran over the pots late at night.\n\nAt this point one guy called me downstairs and gave me a 10minute lecture how to park without doing it. I told him to respectfully f-off and move the plants next to his parking spot. My spot is so awkward, and there is a huge car on the right, so in the dark, when in doubt I am driving over the plants as opposed to damaging the car next to me. He got really livid and we got into a huge argument. \n\nSome people suggested they install lights so I can see better at night and avoid the plants but honestly even in the daylight I have to spend 10minutes manoeuvring and getting out the car to make sure the garden is okay. I don\u2019t wanna do that. I said no and told them I would run over the plants again and they should move. A lot of the people called me an a-hole.

Plants that could be missed if you tried. I still decided that Op wouldn\u2019t be the asshole regardless because they have a designated place to put plants and decided not to do that. It\u2019s also possible they have a balcony like Op and could put plants there too but did not. Also, this isn\u2019t at all what\u2019s happening - plus, I\u2019ve seen semis take out curbs/run into grass and I\u2019ve seen large trucks park on curbs of grassy medians.

BMWs are slightly larger than your average sized sedan, and given the orientation of the parking lot, I can understand their trouble. It also seems they\u2019re parking backwards, but I can be wrong there. Have you ever lived in Europe? Those parking spaces are a lot tighter over there than where I currently live - in the US, our parking spots could easily handle one of those massive 4-door full-trailer Chevy dual-lies. Over there? Fat fucking chance. It\u2019s a relatively expensive car (from the model I googled it\u2019s around $30k *USD* used) so I don\u2019t blame her for wanting to be careful. I bought a car I hate but that still cost me $20k and as much as I\u2019d like to drive it off a cliff myself so I can get a new one I like, I\u2019d be miffed if someone scratched it or dented it. For some people, their cars are more than just a car. It seems silly if you don\u2019t believe in it, but it\u2019s an expensive investment and I\u2019ll be damned if someone other than me messes it up.\n\nAlso, they\u2019re suggesting putting lights so she can see the *plants*. Mostly because the neighbors don\u2019t want to move said plants, so instead they want to put lights so Op can run those over too (I jest). Really, they just want to force it to be her problem because they don\u2019t want to put the plants in the designated area or on their balcony if they have one. OP also mentions she has a large vehicle to the right of her - if we assume they can park correctly and there is no car on the left, but instead a standard gap (which, many are just straight curb with not much room between the line and curb), she has to maneuver around a big vehicle, a curb (which can 100% scratch her car. Some of those curbs in Europe are monsters), and plants. Plus, it\u2019s at an angle. How is she supposed to avoid those plants?\n\nThe simple solution would be for those entitled jerks to move those damn plants. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the solution. It would take two seconds.

You don't know what her driveway looks like based off of her text drawing of it. If it's inconvenient and in someone's way, move your shit. This person likely pays the same amount to live here as they do, why are they violating the space around her parking spot when they have their own? \n\nI don't get how you're on the side of the garden people when she says THERE IS LITERALLY A SPOT TO GARDEN, they just chose not to use it. \n\nAlso \"you lot\" is a fucked up thing to say online. You don't know me, I drive for a living and haven't had an accident in over a decade. And the accident I did have was because a snow plow rear ended me, so im not even at fault for it.\n\nLastly, I didn't say it was in her spot, it is however in the LOT. P A R K I N G L O T. meant for parking vehicles, not planting a garden", "then learn how to drive.... here let me get a big car that i dont know how to use, ny ego is so small i need a big car. talk about ego, buys a car that cant handle and them comes to the internet to complain like a 5 yr. btw i dont think your the ah just an idiot", "Okay that's legit in my books :)\n\nI'll say NTA. But I would suggest that you and the neighbour try to find some kind of compromise. Like installing some lights so that you can see better when arriving when it's dark or you switch parking slots during the time the project's going on?", "You said it's  \"extremely hard to park\". Sorry but it's ridiculous to buy a car that you aren't fully able to park in a multitude of situations. I'm in the market for a new car, I know what I want - and before I buy one, I'm out test driving like a mad woman so I can make sure I don't have a hard time parking the damn thing given that I will need to park every single day.\n\nYou're NTA in this specific situation, because who puts a garden where a car is intended to go, but still.", "Why do you keep imagining the presence of pots? Why can't you respond to the story that actually exists?", "THIS!!!", "...you meant the plants, right?", "She knew when she hit the pots, obviously. But who thinks,  \"I've planted something in a parking lot where it's getting run over...I know, I'll add more stuff for them to hit!\"", "ah yes, because everyone has the time to spend their entire day practicing parking so they don't run over their neighbors kids garden which is built in between parking spaces.\n\nnot like people have jobs or actual lives or anything.", "What exactly bothers you with that response beside it being childish? My car has the same consumption of a base model SUV. An actual gas guzzler does what a gallon per six miles? My car does a 10th of that so 0.1 gallons per six miles. That is more or less fine. The EU has very strict laws in terms of cars\u2019 gas consumption. Attempting to drive an actual gas guzzler over here will cost you around 5 figures yearly. No one does that, so yeah my response is silly. You can look up the car and see that it is not a gas guzzler. It\u2019s not the most modest one either, I am not sugar coating it.\n\nThe lithium battery comment then? What is wrong with it? I haven\u2019t even touched on battery recycling or inhumane treatment of workers in the mines.", "And where should I put my kids? On the trunk or the hood. My 9 year old twins are 5 foot 2. My 13 year old is 5 foot 10. Maybe i should try the roof lol", "So don't be a dick. I bought my vehicle for my kids. They are very tall. I also run several businesses that require transport of large pieces of equipment. I use cameras to aid in the process. I also use cameras in my cars. I would rather protect people, property, and myself than take chances.", "Actually the crosstrek is just an impreza with a lift kit! The more you know. I struggle to get my crosstrek parked straight too. It's got a lot more headroom and the windows give a better exterior view that makes you feel like you're higher and wider than you actually are. The nose is also shorter than you think and the ass is flat. So you feel like you're in a much bigger vehicle than you actually are.", "That's awesome, I love when people mess with snobby neighbors! I'm all for gardening and having pride in the work you put into your own property but when you take it to the level of caring about what your neighbors do with their yard I roll my eyes. I know there are plenty of people will disagree with me but meh, I can't be bothered with what my neighbors do with their yard.", "In their little 8 x 3 ft bed? Yea, no thanks. I couldn't do a little nature between all the buildings. I need a few buildings within nature.", "Not necessarily", "That neighbour is who thought that, clearly. \n\nI gave OP that neighbour was being unreasonable. But I doubt she didn\u2019t know she hit pots. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to as AITA, don\u2019t be rise-color the details about what you\u2019re doing.", "Oh I absolutely agree re: legality. I just thought that adding in would help frame it, since Reddit has a large American user base. I\u2019m assuming OP is in UK or Ireland judging on position of garden and parking space, where driving culture is quite a bit different and safer (at least my impression of UK; no idea about Ireland). They\u2019re probably being too harsh about their driving skills by US standards.\n\nFwiw, I\u2019m from Texas and I loathe large SUVs, too. Wouldn\u2019t mind them on the road so much if there was an additional license class for that size. It\u2019s already lax enough to get a license here; probably should be a little stricter to drive larger vehicles.", "It\u2019s not easier if you\u2019ve had a stroke that wiped out your ability to interpret mirrors. Trust me, it\u2019s a nightmare.", "Sure. People didn\u2019t have several children and none of them were tall before they started selling these stupidly massive SUVs.\n\nMy sister\u2019s husband is 6ft3 and used to drive a Mercedes Smart, btw.\nNow they have four children, one of them is taller than his father and yet, they don\u2019t have a SUV.", "Buying a car you know will be hard for you to park, then parking it badly makes *you* a dick. If you\u2019ve figured out a way to park properly, then cool, no harm no foul.", "Did you see that episode of Community?\n\nTruly a classic.", "I got stories for days. He\u2019s the king of petty pebble-in-the-shoe revenge hahahaha", "I agree. It\u2019s one thing to enjoy gardening but if it\u2019s just to pick on people\u2026I will cover my whole yard with plastic flamingos and wacky armed inflatable tube men \ud83d\ude02", "Fair, but that's more a you problem than a gardening in the city problem. My mother was the main organizer for our community garden which had about.5 acres. Mixed beds (mostly for protection and soil quality) and free growing items like corn and fruit. And yes, that's why I now have a no-lawn apartment and hope to never pick another tomato in my life.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into some of the urban desert gardening. Detroit has been doing some really fascinating things there with abandoned property and produce. That's one of the few contexts where planting in a parking lot makes complete sense.", "I approve.", "She didn't say she didn't know when she hit the pots.  This is a dumb detail, though, and not worth arguing about. \ud83d\ude05", "Saying \"Absolutely!\" doesn't make it true.", "And yet, you found time to come argue with me about arguing about it \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That makes sense.  A minivan carries more than a short bed, and the cargo is protected from the elements and you won't lose the load - but it's a lot harder to take a hose to the cargo area.", "NTA\n\nwhy people with kids feel entitled to everything? use your own parking spot if you think is okay, not someone else\u2019s.", "To summarize yes yes you are an a-hole", "YTA \nIf you can\u2019t drive, don\u2019t", "ESH\nYou should take the time to not damage other people's things even at night.  They should be considerate of where they leave their things in shared spaces.  Running over a bunch of pots shouldn't be a \"guess what\" response.  You should always be away of what is in the space you're about to drive on.", "I'm not sure, but i lean towards YTA. If the driveway is design properly, you should be able to park into your spot, without going over the dirt.  Also from your discreption it sounds like you run over the flowers on purpose. A real picture of the driveway could change my mind. This ASCII scheme just shows, there is an angle in the middle. so propably you should drive backwards into that driveway.", "YTA. if you can't park a BMW, should you even be driving it", "YTA\n\nIn your edit, you say that there's a learning curve, but when someone tried to show you how to avoid running things over, you saw it as a lecture and fought about it instead of handling it like an adult.", "YTA.  You can't drive it you shouldn't buy it.  That you ran over pots is very disturbing.  When you get in a wreck with another car should they not worry about it since you can't judge your new car's dimensions properly?", "Yes.", "Use your fucking headlights and check where you're going dumbass", "No. She said that the plants are planted literally inside of a grid that is in concrete meant to be a driveway. Just because there's a tiny bit of grass growing in a crack on a driveway does not mean you can plan a garden and demand people maneuver around it. They need to plant their Garden in one of the designated areas for gardens were put there driveway Garden next to their own parking spot so the inconveniences themselves and not their neighbors", "Complain to the office. Problem solved.", "No she is not a bad parker. No one should have to maneuver around plants that are planted smack dab in the middle of a driveway this is just dumb", " NTA.  100% NTA.\n\nThat cleared it up for me 100%.\n\nThey should move their garden project where cars can\u2019t travel.", "OP shows disregard for the child-owner of the plants they are running over. If they even apologized and expressed distress over having damaged the plants, it would help. If they tried to solve the problem in any way at all, that would mitigate against the AH-ness. But OP seems quite casual about the effect on other people. \n\nIf I'd been given a shitty parking space, I'd complain to management. I'd ask to trade with someone with a small car. I'd see about parking elsewhere while I practiced in my new big car. Unless they left out all the crucial information that showed they cared even a little bit about other people, I'd reconsider.", "I think you are misreading. The pots are not in the neighbors' assigned spot. They are next to OP's spot, in the general use part of the lot - the part that is not anyone's assigned space but is there for everyone to drive through as they get in and out of their spaces.", "Cars don't levitate. Sometimes you have to go through other parts of the parking lot.", "No. You are wrong. The extra driveway is meant for driving on and maneuvering. The kids can move their plants into a garden area. Ridiculous that somebody would plant a garden on a driveway or next to a parking spot on a driving surface and expected driver to maneuver around it. Gardens are for plants, driveways and parking lots are for cars.", "A parking lot gives you a designated area to park in. Not free reign to drive all over the place to get a regular size car to fit in it.\n\nHypothetical- the space next to hers is now a parking space, think she'll hit the car parked there...?\n\nFact is I've not come across a space I can't park in easily in a parking lot in over 14 years of driving and also no accidents \ud83d\udc4d\n\nBmw gt not a big car lol", "Its in the story why don\u2019t you have better reading comprehension?\n\nEdit to add: 5th paragraph down", "As a former Amazon driver.. everyone should have to drive that sort of vehicle for at least one day.

Is it just a mirror thing or would a backup camera also not work, if I may ask? Just curious."]}
