I am from Pakistan, US raised, while my wife is white from Southern US. Her family (my inlaws) live and breathe football. They are huge fans of their local NCAA team, and most of the family has attended that university. We live near her in-laws, I have first hand experience of the craziness. I don't mind their passion, even though I don't enjoy football much.\n\nWe also have a son (7M) and daughter (2F). My son is quite athletic, and enjoys playing a lot of sports, and is also bigger than many kids his age.\n\nMy father in law has been a coach for a local youth football team for decades. He coached his sons, nephews, and now his grandkids. He recently talked to me about getting my son to join the team. I told him i would think about it, but in reality I'm keen on having my son playing football. I'm physical therapist and see a lot of football injuries, like concussions and CTE; I don't really want to risk my son's health for a game. One of my nephews even got a concussion playing in this league last year. The games also get really intense and toxic. Long practice hours, crazy parents, extremely hard contact, etc. A lot of these kids apparent go on to play college ball so it's SUPER serious. While my father in law is generally a good guy, a competely different side of him comes out when coaching. He will grab these boys by the helmets and scream in their face, and push them. I have often bought thus stuff up to my wife, but she just waves it off.\n\nLast week, my wife asked me to drive my son to her inlaws home for preseason practice with his grandfather. I was surprised because I didnt even know about these practice. I reiterated why I didn't want him playing. This led to an argument where my wife implied I was an AH for not giving importance to her family's traditions. Sidenote: my wife became Muslim a couple of years before we met, and we do give our kids an Islamic upbringing.\n\nI said that there are more important things than my son hurting himself in football, and she said that her dad will make sure nothing happens, but I wasn't convinced. I l said that I am not against my son playing sports, I just don't want him playing hard contact sports. Next day, FIL trie to convince me that my son had a lot of potential to go play in college and go pro, etc. I stood my ground.\n\nI even asked my son whether he actually wants to play in the football league, and he simply said it's what \"Pops\" (what he calls his grandfather) keeps saying I should do. When I pressed, he simply said he doesn't really want to but he said everyone (his uncles, cousins, etc.) Does it so he shouldll as well. My FIL ended up storming out of my house saying I'm just raising a soft kid and then said something about me being Muslim I don't want to repeat. My parents say I was right and my son should focus on school.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1683293001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138lmjl/aita_for_not_letting_my_child_play_on_his/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's possible that the son is being honest and it's possible that it's not. Asking his son what he wants still seems like one of the best things he can do in this scenario even if the circumstances may color the answer differently.\n\nBut to me, the initial answer \"it's what 'Pops' keeps saying I should do\" really does not sound like a \"yes.\" It sounds like at best the son doesn't know what he wants for himself.", "You said you didn't discuss it but does he know that you don't want him on the team?", ">But to me, the initial answer \"it's what 'Pops' keeps saying I should do\" really does not sound like a \"yes.\" It sounds like at best the son doesn't know what he wants for himself.\n\nSee, if he knew his Dad didn't want him to that, to me, seems like an easy way to saying Yes without directly telling his Dad he wants to go against his wishes.", "I never explicitly told him that I didn't want him to play football.
