He and I went out today to go get some ice cream, after which I said I needed to use the restroom. It wasn't the type of \"having to go\" where you have to go for ten minutes or so, but more of a quick pee and exit. He wanted to eat his ice cream, so I asked him nicely to hold my bag and ice cream as I didn't want to put them on the floor. He began protesting, saying he wanted to eat his ice cream. I had to go obviously, so I gave him my stuff and ran to the bathroom. I was upset to come out and find that he had put my ice cream and bag on the floor, and was standing there eating his ice cream. Normally, I don't ask him for things like that, but I didn't want to take my bag and food into the bathroom, as they were kind of dirty. I got a little upset, and instead of saying anything, he starts laughing at me about it. Later after I left, I tried texting him about it and letting him know I was upset, to which he responded that I needed to \"find another coatrack\", and he proceeded telling me to \"shut the fuck up\". I told him I had only asked one thing of him, and if he really expected me to stand there and argue with him when I had to use the restroom. He said he didn't damage the bag and that nothing happened to it, but I find it disgusting that he just put my food on the floor instead of holding it for two minutes. I asked him if he really couldn't wait to eat his ice cream, and he responded he shouldn't have to be my coatrack. He continuously kept telling me this issue is not a big deal, and although it may not be to him, it is to me, as I wouldn't do that to him. His response to this was just awful, and I let him know it has upset me and I will just drop it then after the third or fourth time he told me to \"shut the fuck up\". I can't help but wonder here: AITA for asking my bf to hold my bag while I use the restroom?\n\n**1 CommentShareSave**", "created_utc": 1678853681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rlr37/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_hold_my_bag_while_i_use/", "score": 1952, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't get me wrong, if I'm sitting on my patio chair and have a bowl, I wouldn't hesitate to place it on the ground a minute.  But while out in a public place like that, doing so is rude. Very.

My thought being, \"the man's no sissy\".", "I assumed the ice cream was in a container, requiring a spoon to eat, otherwise he could have eaten his if it was a cone and continues holding hers while having the bag on a shoulder or under an elbow.", "I remember the mustard story! It was wild.", "I have teen sons and they absolutely don't treat people this way. I can't tell you how many times they offer to hold my coat or purse to be helpful.", "My whole life and existence better be in peril if I'm told to STFU \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I also thought it said 5 months I was like bitch that\u2019s barely even a friend- ditch him.  5 YEARS and he acts like that? Half a decade of wasted life with someone like that?", "FAMILY SURVIVAL SATCHEL \ud83d\ude02 Yes, I'll be using that from now on!", "Putting a purse and food on the ground is disgusting.  I have paid for enough MK purses for my wife and daughters that there is zero chance in hell I am putting them on the floor.  Putting food on the floor, that is disgusting as hell.", "I used to do that for my then girlfriend (now wife). Sling it on my shoulder and place it in front so I can make sure it was safe. Or I would rock the bag like it was the perfect accessory to whatever I was wearing.\n\nNow, as a dad, it either goes into the stroller with all the other things. If possible, if I'm asked to watch something, I'll literally watch it. Don't care if I look silly staring at something from 2 inches away. I was told to watch the item, so I'm going to watch it.", "Same, and sometimes (if it \u201cmatches\u201d) he\u2019ll parade it around the store and show it off. Took a few years because he did used to be embarrassed, but he realized nobody cares", "Before me and my bf were dating I asked him if he could hold my bag while I put my jacket on, he proceeded to wear it and it carried it to our next pub. It was cute.", "u/Jumpyrogramme is a bot.", "Yes!! His eyes are hazel and if they are grayish that day he won\u2019t give it back", "I got incel and toxic masculinity vibes.", "Even if it was in a cup I'd still be able to eat it by holding both in one hand and the spoon in the other lol. But then again I'm a female so", "Adding to this thread that my bf would gladly hold my bag if asked and would do a quick little model pose to make my laugh before I walked away. Unless OP\u2019s bag was full of bricks without any handles, her hopefully soon to be ex boyfriend was just being an asshole.", "If my wife asks to carry her stuff I carry it! If she looks uncomfortable I tell her I will carry it and take it. Basic manners. This boy isn\u2019t right in the head!", "that's hilarious", "Exactly! I don't spend a lot of money on my purses, I look to see if it's functional and cute, and then I'm good. However, I have an insulin pen and unused needles in my purse. I wouldn't want that stuff contaminated by all the germs and whatever else is on the floor! That's gross and so inconsiderate.", "I honestly don't care if the bottom of my purse touches the floor of a restaurant, it's not like the floor doesn't get mopped every day and I don't typically handle the bottom of my purse anyway, so what's the big deal?\n\nThat said, it doesn't MATTER if it's a big deal to me, if it's a big deal to someone else and they ask me to hold their purse, of course I hold the purse! That's just basic politeness! I would do this for a random stranger, I can't imagine refusing to do it for my own SO.\n\nBetween this and the \"STFU\" comments, I hope this guy is an ex already.", "u/Inside_Custome is a bot.", "That\u2019s hilarious! They sounds like they would gladly hold our bags and argue whose looks better!", "Yeah he seems like a winner all around \ud83d\ude44", "This. I don't understand how this dude is unable to hold multiple things. NTA but I would not be with a man who treats me like that.", "I\u2019ve handed by purse to my boyfriend while I ran to the bathroom to come back expecting him to be holding it awkwardly in his hands because some men freak out when it comes to holding a purse. Instead, I come out and he is wearing it over his shoulder. He says it\u2019s no big and more comfortable to hold it that way, which of course I agree with but it was a pleasant surprise at first.", "Mine just sort of awkwardly holds it and will quickly give it back when I'm ready. He doesn't complain more like just not used to it", "Even if the purse was full of bricks with no handles, he shouldn't have put her food on the floor. That would have been the line for me. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have eaten anymore.\n\nETA: the purse is actually one of those backpack purses. This makes him even more of an AH than I originally thought!", "oh HELL no. my mom keeps insulin in hers as well, and if she does not put her purse in the special bag on her wheelchair, my dad is carrying it/ The thought of her purse going on the floor is appalling"]}
