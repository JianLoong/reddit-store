{"id": 12325, "submission_id": "11rlr37", "title": "AITA for asking my bf to hold my bag while I use the restroom?", "selftext": "Today I went to go see my boyfriend of five years and a few months. He and I went out today to go get some ice cream, after which I said I needed to use the restroom. It wasn't the type of \"having to go\" where you have to go for ten minutes or so, but more of a quick pee and exit. He wanted to eat his ice cream, so I asked him nicely to hold my bag and ice cream as I didn't want to put them on the floor. He began protesting, saying he wanted to eat his ice cream. I had to go obviously, so I gave him my stuff and ran to the bathroom. I was upset to come out and find that he had put my ice cream and bag on the floor, and was standing there eating his ice cream. Normally, I don't ask him for things like that, but I didn't want to take my bag and food into the bathroom, as they were kind of dirty. I got a little upset, and instead of saying anything, he starts laughing at me about it. Later after I left, I tried texting him about it and letting him know I was upset, to which he responded that I needed to \"find another coatrack\", and he proceeded telling me to \"shut the fuck up\". I told him I had only asked one thing of him, and if he really expected me to stand there and argue with him when I had to use the restroom. He said he didn't damage the bag and that nothing happened to it, but I find it disgusting that he just put my food on the floor instead of holding it for two minutes. I asked him if he really couldn't wait to eat his ice cream, and he responded he shouldn't have to be my coatrack. He continuously kept telling me this issue is not a big deal, and although it may not be to him, it is to me, as I wouldn't do that to him. His response to this was just awful, and I let him know it has upset me and I will just drop it then after the third or fourth time he told me to \"shut the fuck up\". I can't help but wonder here: AITA for asking my bf to hold my bag while I use the restroom?\n\n**1 CommentShareSave**", "created_utc": 1678853681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rlr37/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_hold_my_bag_while_i_use/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't get me wrong, if I'm sitting on my patio chair and have a bowl, I wouldn't hesitate to place it on the ground a minute.  But while out in a public place like that, doing so is rude. Very.
