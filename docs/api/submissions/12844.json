It was our family tradition and they want to continue with my kids, Sadie (9F) and Jamie (6M). Sadie will be turning 10 soon so my parents told her that they will be taking her and Jamie to Disney.\n\nThey\u2019re only paying for my kids, so my husband Sam (34M) and I have decided to save up to join the trip and make memories together as a family (us, our kids, and my parents). Everything was fine, but my husbands sister/SIL Emma (29F) heard about the trip and wants her daughter Avery (10F) to also join along and has been forcefully trying to get her way even after I\u2019ve said no countless times.\n\nEmma is a single/teen mom (dads not in the picture), so it\u2019s been very difficult for her to be able to provide Avery with certain experiences and opportunities that my kids have been given. Since Avery just turned 10 and didn\u2019t have a party/big gift, Emma thinks Avery is entitled to a Disney trip too because my parents (who are in no way related to her!) are taking Avery\u2019s cousins. I thought this was so rude of her to even ask because why would my parents pay for her daughter\u2019s trip when she\u2019s not their grandchild? When I told her this, she then kept insinuating that since Sam and I are paying for ourselves to go, we could probably save for Avery to go too.\n\nI love my niece and feel guilty she isn\u2019t able to have such experiences, but it should not be a financial burden my husband and I have to constantly bear. We already help a lot by buying groceries, babysitting, pay for sports teams, school supplies. When I sternly told her my parents won\u2019t be paying and that my husband and I don\u2019t want to or have to pay either, she then had the audacity to drop the \u201cwe\u2019re all family/it takes a village to raise a child\u201d card on me. I HAVE HELPED HER SO MUCH, Sam and I have just lost it on her because she isn\u2019t even appreciative of what we\u2019ve already done to help her provide necessities for her child yet she always wants to ask for more.\n\nNot once has she suggested paying for some of Avery\u2019s plane ticket, park pass, hotel. She just wants us to bear this cost so her daughter can live a life she can\u2019t provide for. I know it sounds terrible, but I hate having to be the one who has to feel guilty and pay up so that Avery can live like our family when Emma won\u2019t even try to pay for some of it. I told her my final decision is no unless if she wants to pay for Avery, then I don\u2019t mind taking care of Avery on the trip and will let her come along which Emma said no to because she can\u2019t afford it.\n\nNow my daughter is saying Avery told her I ruined \u201cTHEIR\u201d trip and Avery \u201chates\u201d me. I think Emma already told Avery she would be coming on the trip before even speaking to me and now had to tell her she can\u2019t go anymore because I \u201cwon\u2019t let her\u201d. On one hand, Sam and I want to stand our ground and won\u2019t pay, but also don\u2019t want to ruin ours and our kid\u2019s relationship with our niece.

Bless you for all of the help you have given over the years.\n\nEnjoy this time with your kids, SO, and parents!", "Clearly NTA. And I imagine you are right- your SIL likely told Avery that she would be going on this trip before speaking with you.\n\nI think there are a few paths here. No matter what, I think you need to speak to your daughter and give her an age appropriate explanation about why her cousin isn't coming on this trip.\n\nThat said, I sorta think you and your husband need to have a conversation. Your SIL clearly has the position that you should support her child like its yours and that isn't okay. And maybe that means that no matter how much you love Avery and want to help her that you and DH need to back off some of your support. \n\nMaybe you no longer help with things like groceries and activities. That you'll help with school supplies, but only if it's you taking your kids and Avery shopping for school supplies. Basically, you cover things for Avery when you are doing things with/for your kids so Avery is being included.\n\nCuz yes, it takes a village to raise a child to adulthood. But that village has to start with the parents understanding that the village isn't responsible for everything. They're there to help your child become a better person- not pay for Mickey Mouse ears.", "NTA, this is not your responsibility. I get wanting better things for your child, but some things just aren't feasible. It doesn't mean it's your problem to make up for. Emma sounds extremely entitled and ungrateful so of course she's making you the bad guy to her daughter. Just be honest with your child about it and they'll likely work it out between each other. Probably better for Avery to realize her mom is weaponizing her.", "NTA\n\nI hate to say it but maybe you should limit contact with Emma and Avery? If Emma is able to use her daughter to instill guillt and pressure on your daughter, it can have a very negative effect on your children.\n\n The worst is that Emma is basically teaching Avery to be entitled... So you should try to correct that behaviour when it's still possible. As a part of the village, of course.", "NTA - You are not ruining the relationship with your niece.  Your SIL is doing that all on her own.  She needs to grow up and actually act like an adult.  Do not give in.  If you give in then your SIL will continue to use and take advantage of you.

My kid is aware of money, aware that sometimes you just don't have it.

It ends with your kid either getting some savior concept or your kid flipping other way and becoming a full on \"the poor suck\" when she starts putting two and two together.", "NTA, Emma seems to think that your money is also her money.

This is your parents trip that they plan for their grandchildren. If Emma can get the money together, you would take her with you.

You help out with the necessities that you don't technically have to, but Emma is being very ungrateful. \n\nTrips like this are a luxury and if you help her out once, she would bank on you to do it everytime, and you will be setting Avery up to dream for a life that her mother cannot give her at the moment. \n\nYour SIL is acting very entitled, do not enable her behavior. If she is already ungrateful for all the things you actually do for her, imagine the boost her entitlement will get if you start taking her kid out for trips like this.", "NTA. Your SIL is being entitled. I grew up poor but all my cousins were middle class. They had things I didn't have, but I never thought it was unfair or I was allowed to do their things.

I feel for the 10 year old and I'm sure she was excited for disneyland. Now all she knows is that she can't go and her mom told her to blame you. 10 year olds have a hard time hearing logic or seeing their parents as anything but their hero. I'm sorry that you got turned into the villain. If you pay for her, then no one learns anything and she still might not appreciate what you did because she is still angry at you. The mom sounds like a hot mess and I don't blame her because she can't afford some things but there are more tactful ways to ask for help. At the very least she should be appreciative of what you already do for them. I'm leaning NTA.", "NTA.   You are not obligated to pay for a trip for your niece and obviously your parents aren't either.  Your SIL was very bold for even suggesting this.\n\nIt's very kind that you have been financially supporting them.\n\nIn a perfect world, Emma wouldn't have asked and there would have been funds available to take Avery too.   I have sympathy for Avery because it must be hard to see what her cousins get and know that she can't have that.

Your parents have zero relationship to her daughter. \n\nI would stop giving them money in light of how she is trash talking you through her daughter, at least until she tells the truth and admits that is not what happened and the trip was never supposed to include her and also how much support you've been providing all along. It sounds like you have been VERY generous and rather than being grateful for you paying for her groceries, school supplies, sports teams, and helping with babysitting, Emma just always has her hand out expecting more.", "NTA. Emma has really put everyone in an unfortunate situation, but don't hesitate to keep your boundaries.

Even first cousins are not asked to go along on a trip like you are talking about. My husband was raised this way, we raised our kids this way, our kids are raising their kids this way. There is cousin get-togethers\u2014and I'm guessing your intention is to have this child be a cousin to your kids\u2014and then there is immediate family stuff. Your husband's SIL is feeling sorry for herself, which is a bad decision on her part. She needs to take her attention off what she doesn't have and build a circle of friends and immediate family to raise her daughter in\u2014and I say this as someone who successfully did just this as a single teenage mother. If she lets her daughter be a cousin, or cousin-in-law to your kids without pushing for greater inclusion, then the kids will see her as equal to them.
