I told my mother I killed her daughter and buried her in the yard when she gave me shit about coming out. So you handled it better than I did", "NTA. For one, it's super insulting to people who actually have lost a child and would fucking kill for your parents situation instead. Secondly, your dad's response is more telling as to what the problem is than your mom's, they think it's something you're going to snap out of and your mom's approach is to guilt-trip you into reverting back to what makes her more comfortable. There is a level of adjustment for parents, particularly those who aren't particularly progressive or enlightened about LGBTQ issues, that I think is normal, but this is well above and beyond what's acceptable.", "nta \n\nshe didn\u2019t \u201close a daughter\u201d. no child has been lost, you\u2019ve just found a way to be yourself. i hope things get better soon <3", "nta, you could never be an asshole for this.  i don\u2019t want to say too much or overstep, because i\u2019m just a cis girl, but i will say that you\u2019re absolutely right: they should not be \u201cmourning\u201d for their \u201cdaughter\u201d.  they should be celebrating their nonbinary child.", "NTA\n\nInfo: how old are you?\n\nPropose a family therapy, if they don\u2019t agree, then it\u2019s on them of not wanting to understand you. If possible, go low contact with them.", "NTA.  You are you. And there is nothing wrong with embracing you. And you are still there to talk to her.  She's mourning the child she thought she had and not seeing the one she has. Sorry you aren't in a more supportive environment.   \n\n\nHappy Anniversary!!!", "NTA.\n\nI mean, it sucks that your family isn't supportive. The reality is that they will either choose to accept you/love you or they won't. You know what feels right to you, and from what you mentioned it sounds like even fairly mild steps are confounding to your parents.\n\nSince you said you are 15, and I assume moving out or staying with other family isn't an option, when things are calmer I would try to approach your mom (who seems somewhat amenable to reason) and talk to her. Say that it's hurtful to hear that she misses you when you're right there, trying to figure out how to navigate being your authentic self. Tell her you can still bond over lots of things, even if it looks different than she expected. In a perfect world, all parents would just immediately adapt, but it sounds like she's taking some time to mourn that she had a vision of \"a daughter\" that is now not going to happen the way expected. And then try to authentically connect with her over those things. If you can be calm, I think she'll maybe be able to see the light. You can even say, \"Mom, if I had naturally very small boobs, would you be mourning the loss of a daughter? Why does having breasts make me more worthy of love or not?\" It seems silly, but maybe remind her of the \"feminine\" things you still enjoy. She may be seeking to just understand that you aren't going to become a totally and completely different person.\n\nThe reason I say work on Mom because it sounds like Dad is just anti-trans and it would be helpful to have an ally in your Mom. I can't tell if Dad is just super transphobic or he's upset that Mom is crying and there's anger/chaos emotionally in the house. In any event, good luck, and sorry you're dealing with this. Do you have resources and trusted adults around you who can support you?", "Nta and i am so sorry.", "NTA. What the fuck", "NTA\n\nYour dad told you exactly what they think of your transition: it\u2019s a phase and you\u2019re only \u201cacting\u201d trans because you want to be \u201cspecial\u201d. Then they stole from you so you can\u2019t get your binder. They\u2019re transphobic. You could never be the asshole here.", "NTA. They are the assholes.   \n\n\nas a fellow AFAB nonbinary, I'm telling you, RUN, do not walk. both of your parents are very transphobic and have been ACTIVELY hiding this from you. I would bet that they're saying awful things about you behind your back to whoever will listen.    \n\n\nalso, \"they took all of my money as punishment\" is SO worrying. I don't know how old you are but if it's money that you rightfully earned via labor, that's awful. If you have a job, I suggest asking them to pay you in checks or some other method. Checks are much easier to hide than paper money. It will make the money less accessible but in this case that's to your benefit.  \n\n\nI am so sorry that the people responsible for your being in this world are treating you this awfully. From one nonbinary person to another, I love you. You are part of this community no matter what they do. Even if you have to hide it until you can leave, even if you have to pretend to be cis in order for them to treat you like a person again- you have family, in all of your nonbinary siblings and your trans brothers and sisters. You matter. You aren't having a phase or making a stupid decision. Your feelings are valid and your identity matters. I hope you can get out of there. \u2665", "Absolutely NTA...\n\nI am so sorry. Sounds like mom is trying to guilt-trip you, and dad is just completely out of line. You don't deserve to be treated this way.", "NTA. Just a heads up, my mother still considers me dead after 12 years so this behavior is unlikely to change. Be prepared for the reality that your transphobic parents will stay that way forever.", "NTA \n\nBut she did lose a daughter.\n\nMy sibling is just that a sibling, they used to be my sister.\n\nI can't say I have a sister without being disrespectful.\n\nBut \"mourning\" on her side is too far, she can still share a life with you.", "NTA.  It\u2019s totally situations like this that people need to start thinking about when they have kids.  Your kids won\u2019t always turn out the way you imagined or wanted.  Period.  Nothing wrong with being non-binary and God bless OP for living true to themself.  Parents need to get over their preconceived notions before they alienate their kids.", "NTA, it sounds like she is mourning a fictional idealised daughter which honestly would be a hard shadow to live under even if you WERE a cis girl.\n\nI'm so sorry they don't support you. Congrats on your first year and getting your binder! May your life be full of beautiful non binary milestones like this. \n\nBeing happy shouldn't have to be a rebellion against your family but if it turns out that way then GO HARD. Be as happy as you can. They can't hold you back forever.", "Relationships are a two-way street. You give and you receive something - you have needs and expectations for the relationship.\nFor you, who has always felt this way, a label only helps you express how you've always been, but for your mom, her entire view on the relationship is shifting, and it's normal to mourn that - she had her expectations, and you had yours. She's mourning her expectations from the relationship, and it's okay to do so. It hurts to hear this, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry your mom had a different expectation for you, and how you're still you and it feels like she's rejecting you. You're not responsible for her image of you or her feelings, but it's important to understand that to build a relationship you need to be vulnerable, to let her see what you're like, how you're the same but also the label allows the world to see what you're like, without hiding. It's normal to hurt each other, but how you go from there, why you work on the relationship, is for your mom's, your dad's, and your own happiness as well. You're young, you need all the support you can get, and your parents are your best bet.\nI think you guys need to talk with each other, and be vulnerable about your feelings. It seems to me you're both hurting, and the way you express your hurt is by defending yourselves by words like this. I hear tension in your house, and it's a difficult way to live, it's stressful and not talking about it properly is only making it worse. \nIf it's hard to talk, you might want to look for a psychologist, not a therapist. Either go alone and vent+practice how and what you need to talk about, or go together, as you need a mediator and a safe place to talk. \nYou're not an asshole for hurting, but you're both hurting each other by the way you talked to each other.", "Are you trans or are you non binary and who says baking is feminine and video games are masculine? You have some very very firm ideas about gender roles. \n\nAlso you are not the same as you were before. That\u2019s not necessarily bad but it\u2019s just a fact. You are not the same. You are wearing a binder so you will look different, you want people to call you by different pronouns and those are changes, so you are not the same and in fact you are celebrating a year since you have made changes so don\u2019t yell at your mom saying you are the same. I dint think you\u2019re an asshole for changing but don\u2019t yell and curse at your mom.", "I might get downvoted but hear me out. NAH sorta. Your parents don\u2019t get it. But as long as they\u2019re not totally shitty parents they should come around. Remember this is unfamiliar territory for them too and they are not always going to get it right. They might be mourning the \u201cidea\u201d of how they assumed your life would go, your future marriage/kids/etc and they might be scared because they don\u2019t know how to navigate but you ARE NOT responsible for their expectations. It\u2019s not your responsibility to live a life THEY want. They chose their own life choices for themselves. Your responsibility is to yourself and to pursue a life that makes you the best version of yourself, and to be a happy and healthy person. Do you have others around you to help be supportive? Hopefully your parents reconsider family therapy for themselves or join a parent support group to educate themselves. Congrats on your 1 year Transiversary! Always be true to yourself because you are the only you!", "NTA. Next time your sperm donor makes some comment about \"all trans people wanting special treatment\" clap back with \"equal treatment isn't special treatment\". If your birthing person wants to keep mourning you like you're dead, promise to go full no contact so she can pretend like you're dead even harder. Also, you should totally contact legal aid about them stealing **your** money.  \n\n\nThey only do that shit because they think they won't face familial or legal consequences. Promise them they will unless things change. They can either accept you, or you will leave them and treat them like strangers who have stolen from you.", "NTA, your family members are blatantly transphobic AH's and they need to learn what unconditional love is, and tbh you might find a better loving family elsewhere as in friends and partners, it is unfortunate but a reality us trans/non-binary folk have to deal with. Sending you virtual hugs and positive energy <3", "NTA. You can either be the moody child in the room or be a boy right in front of them, trying to impress other people shouldn't become your personality.

I understand you need to be who you are, but your mother has every right to mourn the relationship she thought she would have with you.  \n\nI don\u2019t understand what getting a binder has to do with your story.

I totally understand if you don't wish to answer because you're not comfortable with that.\n\nAs a cis woman, by your description and borrowing your words, you like more feminine things than me. I was always a tomboy and still am. I hate to wear dreasses and makeup.

What inside of you make you know that instead of being a woman (since you said you like \"girly\" things), you are actually a non binary person?\n\nAgain, I hope I'm not being the ahole here. I'm just trying to walk in other's shoes.", "I'm sorry you're going through this. I agree, it's good to wait until you're calm.\n\nJust remind your mom that you're still YOU even if you look a little different. She'd love you if you cut your hair right? So why is a binder that much different? Remind her of the things you still like and enjoy, and suggest you bond over those things still.\n\nI can't be sure of your situation, but I think often people are fearful of NB or trans stuff because they don't really understand what it means. Or they are afraid that it means you became unrecognizable, or your personality changes completely, or that you've rejected them as family/parents. There are other reasons, of course, but if your mom doesn't sound like a crazy religious bigot or what-not, it's worth a shot.\n\nAnother approach -- you can tell her you still really love her, need a mom, need someone to confide in. Maybe reminding her that as an adult, she has responsibilities to fulfill for YOU will also help.", "Gotta admit, that one tripped me up too. I\u2019ve always heard NB and trans talked about as if they were separate things.

I differ a little to OP, I'm more androgynous and use any pronouns. It differs from person person but I hope I can help.\n\nFor me, it helps that I can now separate myself from the social expectations that come with my assigned gender (AGAB). Before coming out, I would receive criticism for having friends that weren't the same perceived gender as me, I'd get asked stupid questions about what it was like living with only (gender) housemates, do I keep them in line? I no longer get asked if I know how to do (traditionally gendered but very straightforward task e.g. sewing or using a drill), among many many other things. I don't want to \"break gender stereotypes\", I want to be free from them completely.\n\nIt's also helped me a lot because I had a lot of resentment and internalised sexism against my assigned gender, I hated that I felt like I was meant to be putting on a character and I resented others because they were doing it better than me. Coming out made me come to terms with what it meant to be my AGAB and how while it didn't fit me, it fitted my cis AGAB counterparts, and I'm a lot mentally healthier now, and form healthier relationships with others, regardless of gender.", "I don't really know how to explain it but I just don't feel like a girl or a boy I just feel like I'm in the middle.

They may not have gotten these tactics explicitly in this way, but simply seen them spoken about or demonstrated as a positive, good mental health and family support kind of thing. Of course, all of this propaganda rarely talks about how this alienates children from their parents. They just tell detransitioning \"success\" stories. I think this is why your dad snapped.
