Yeah it sucks for them but it's not your responsibility. Sure it would have been nice of you to babysit for them. Are you obligated to? No.", "NTA. You don't jump from no babysitting experience to a 5 day commitment. It would have been irresponsible of them to leave the kids with you.", "ESH. They are your kids, so you're not obligated to look after them, but you did screw your sister over, just because you didn't want to watch kids.", "You have no experience with kids & they're content letting you watch their young children for 5 days?  These parents sound selfish & irresponsible.  Too bad for them that their babysitter fell through.  They can't expect an inexperienced person to watch their kids for that long.", "WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE THEIR KIDS WITH PEOPLE WHO DON\u2019T WANT TO WATCH THEM!! I get it if it\u2019s an emergency but kids are a lot of work and need constant attention and leaving them with someone who really doesn\u2019t want to watch them is just yuck! Let alone for 5 days!", "NTA mom here and I don't think I would even ask if my siblings could watch my kids that long. My kids are the same age your niblings and for someone who's not used to taking care of kids 24/7 that would be too much. She's not wrong for asking but you're also not wrong for declining either. She is TA for getting mad though. Part of being a parent is understanding that sometimes plans get changed and trips get cancelled because outside circumstances change.", "NTA, 5 days is not babysitting that's way more.", "NTA.you shouldn't babysit for several days if you don't have experience\n\nETA if anyone asks if you have plans ask why Instead of answering. They always ask if you have plans when they want to make your plans", "Exactly. I love my niece and I often look after her... but 5 days in a row? No chance. Kids are exhausting and they'd probably would be difficult because they'd miss their parents (which 4 year old wants to be away from their parents for 5 days?).\n\nWhy couldn't they take their kids with them?\n\nIn the end the job as a parent is to be a parent first and everything comes after... they can't find a babysitter? Well bad luck, that's what you sign up for if you're having kids.\n\nNTA.", "Exactly. I had two grandsons. We've kept them while their parents traveled. I love them dearly. Sweet baby Jesus. It was exhausting. They talk non-stop. They like to sleep with me. Lost count of kicks over night. It's perfectly fine to say no to your sister. Some times parents can't do what they'd like due to circumstances. Doesn't mean she can expect you to babysit", "I just say I\u2019m not your date night babysitter, but if you need to have an emergency appendectomy or something, I am your woman, at least until the real babysitter/grandparent/other family arrives to take over.", "THIS , OP!!!!! NTA I sometimes mind my friends kids for a couple of hours and it\u2019s exhausting! Am a guy btw", "Same. I actually don't think I would take on someone else's for that long. We're still at the \"my kids don't have sleepovers\" phase because I am not prepared to be responsible for someone else's kid overnight and mine are 4.5 and 8.", "They are your half sister and brother. Step means parents are married but the kids aren\u2019t related.", "So why couldn't one of them watch the kids? Is she mad at them, too, for not volunteering to watch her kids or just you? (NTA)", "Plus kids were out of school. Its five full days of childcare", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, I applaud you. You're not comfortable with it and you know this. As a mom, it's 100% MY responsibility to make sure the person looking after my kids is comfortable doing so. Plans fall through. It sucks, but it happens. I say you did the right thing by not doing it. And like someone else said, no plans is still doing something: self care and relaxation.", "NTA. Whomp whomp. This is part of parenthood! Your plans are irrelevant for the most part now! That\u2019s why I\u2019m childless.", "NTA. No is a complete answer and you do not owe her anything else on this topic, sister or not.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re qualified to be surprise handed TWO young children for FIVE full days, and it was perfectly reasonable for you to decline. It\u2019s not selfish to not put yourself or the kids in that situation.\n\n    I tried to explain that I don't really know anything about kids or how to deal with them, but she got mad at me and called me selfish.", "NTA.  They didn't have to cancel their trip.  They could have taken THEIR KIDS with them.  They aren't your responsibility.", "NTA but your sister is. So many people I read with kids think they csn dump them on who is most convenient. Itd5be amuch different story if the kids ends up bumped, bruised or worse. You told her straight up that you were unsuitable so she should've found someone else. They might have cost a bit more but thats how it goes sometimes", "What's the old saying, 'a lack of planning on your part doesn't create an emergency on my part.  NTAH...  If your sister keeps up, just ask her, 'are you still complaining about that?  Get over it and move on.'.", "NTA. That arrangement could even be dangerous to the kids, those are bad parents.", "NTA. Sister, however, set a trap for you, not cool. She wanted to dithch her kids on you, but you're the selfish one? No.", "NTA. Bottom line is, you don\u2019t have experience with it and wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable. It\u2019s way better for you to tell your sister that than taking them for five days and not knowing what to do if an emergency came up.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility.", "NTA. They chose to become parents. They can't get mad at other people for not watching their children.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I love taking care of kids, but it's not everyone's delight. Still, you don't owe her shit, why should you?\n\nIf you'd promised beforehand, you'd owe her something, but here? Nah. Plus, five days is a long time. If this was a night out, sure, maybe you'd be being kind of selfish. But a four and seven year old for five days is a lot.\n\n>My sister asked me why, since I'm home all week with no plans anyways. She had asked me if I had plans for that week before asking me to babysit. If she had just asked me to babysit first, I would've lied and said I have plans.\n\nLmao, of course you would've. That's why people ask \"Are you free?\" first, before telling you that they're trying to give you an obligation, not make plans for the movies.", "NTA When you have kids you should plan trips with them. Not just dump them. And yes I\u2019m a parent and I\u2019m knackered but my child is my responsibility.", "NTA\n\nOne day, short notice emergency? Thats fine. But a five day trip, and knowing you dont have much kid experience? I would never even ask.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe her any explanation about why you don't want to babysit. It's not your fault they had to cancel their plans. It's their responsibility to find proper cover for THEIR kids. Theirs alone.", "NTA. That is a long time to babysit at a moment's notice. \n\nAlso, I hate when people ask if you have plans right before they ask you to do something huge. It feels very manipulative to me. When someone does that to me I usually respond \"don't confuse my free time with my availability\".", "NTA.", "What about the brother babysitting?", "NTA I really don't get these parents planning holidays without thier kids amd expecting others to drop everything to look after thier kids,  you (mostly) choose to be a parent, that not a part time commitment, you don't get holidays your lucky if you get a date night.", "NTA - I\u2019ve had kids, and I still wouldn\u2019t want to watch anybody else\u2019s kids for that long.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t know how she would feel comfortable leaving her kids with someone who doesn\u2019t know how to handle kids. Sounds like a disaster for all parties. If anything, she was being selfish leaving them with you. Good on you for being honest.", "I say this as a mother and aunt who also refuses to babysit unless it's an extreme emergency or a 5 minute thing. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust make it a NO.", "Nta - I mean why can't she ask the father of the children to look after his kids or maybe take them with her?", "5 days with 4 and 7 on winter break would, as someone who LIKES kids and DOES generally have a pretty good idea what I'm doing, be 50/50 on saying yes based on the kids involved for me. It would DEFINITELY be something planned LONG in advance (barring big emergencies obvs) so I could lay in supplies of activities, kid-appropriate foods, and so on. NTA, didn't they have ANYONE on her husband's side they could ask?", "NTA!  If only for the fact that I absolutely hate/loathe/detest someone asking me \"what are you doing such and such a time or date/ what are your plans etc?\"   I've taken to asking \"why do you want to know?\".  Otherwise, you'll get asked to do something you don't want to and usually get the \"you said you weren't doing anything, so why can't you?!\".  \n\nSucks to be sis!", ">However your sister has every right to be mad at you as you are the reason they had to cancel.\n\nNo, the mother who got sick is the reason why the trip had to be cancelled.\n\nOP is not obligated to babysit. Her sister is not entitled to free childcare. OP didn't take something away from her sister. She didn't deny her sister anything. Sure, she didn't do what her sister wanted her to do, but there is no resposibility to babysit. Especially not for five days.", ">and could've helped\n\nNo. Someone who has zero experience with children, dealing with rowdy kids for five days? No. OP could not have helped. OP would not be a suitable babysitter.\n\nAnd even if OP is available and could have helped... There is no obligation to babysit. The children are her sister's responsibility, not hers. Whether she is family or not is completely irrelevant.", "They can ask. They accepted the full sentence NO. They didn\u2019t expressed anything to OP, she learned from their brother. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an emergency, but why OP is surprise displaying again her dislike of kids on her sister kids won\u2019t bother the sister in anyway", "I didn\u2019t said it was an emergency. \n\nHowever in case of an emergency they do know now that OP won\u2019t be someone they can rely on. She won\u2019t even think about doing anything and actively lie to avoid it. \n\nShe showed her on confort is above even considering helping out her family. She have the right to do so \n\nHow Op can\u2019t comprehend why she might be a disappointment for a sister and aunt might be comprehensible for other self centred. Some like shallow interaction even with close ones.", "She wrote her brother had to work. OP was unemployed at that time and was \"home all week with no plans anyways\". So the brother had a better excuse for not babysitting.\n \nNo idea about the father. My guess is he also had a job and had to work. Someone with young children often has parents who haven't reached retirement age yet.", "Is it ok if I refer to my step sister and my half sister as simply my sisters?", "Yes, of course. That's not wrong, because it is unspecific."]}
