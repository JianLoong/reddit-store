Like I would only ask my MIL and my SIL (because she has her own kids and loves having kids around). So it is weird for your sister to ask you in the first place.\n\nSecond, the way she asked the question is rude AF. I remember a friend of my wife's calling one night to ask if we had plans. We said \"no\" thinking that we were going to be invited to go do something fun and then she was like, \"Oh great..hey can I drop my kids of at your house overnight because we have a date and our babysitter canceled?\"  That is a shady way of approaching the matter.\n\nLook I get why your sister is upset about having to cancel her plans but that is not your problem.

They could get sick, fall off stairs, get into a fight or maybe choke on something. Unsure how old you are but although it sounds easier to look after 4 and 7 year old, there are things that could go wrong as well. So forcing that responsibility on you is not a nice thing. Your sister could have taken the kids with her or what about the kids dad's family? Also you say your sister's mother, so assume she's your step sister? She can be as mad as she wants and don't take on responsibility you aren't comfortable with. They aren't your kids and they aren't your problem to solve.", "NTA being in charge of two kids for that long is way too stressful. They are not your responsibility. Guess what they are parents it\u2019s their kids. If they can\u2019t find someone else to watch it\u2019s their problem. I hate it when a person is called selfish just because they told other person no.
