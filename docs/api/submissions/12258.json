A week is a lo g time with kids if you 1) don\u2019t like them and 2) aren\u2019t experienced in looking after them. That\u2019s a big imposition to ask you to do this at such short notice", "NTA I don\u2019t have kids and my husband and I are child free, but I nannied 3 boys for 8+ years and have even watched them for full weeks while their parents are out of town. If you aren\u2019t comfortable watching children and have no experience doing so, that would have been a very stressful situation for both you and the kids.", "NTA. \u2018Doing nothing all week\u2019 is actually doing something, it\u2019s called self care and relaxation. Your sister is asking way to much from you considering you don\u2019t really like children and don\u2019t feel comfortable having them for a week.

Its not an easy task, especially when you don't really like children.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe your free time to anyone. And if childcare falls through, those kids are their responsibility, not yours. \n\nFor next time, if she asks what you\u2019re doing a certain time say \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d This is how I answer my entitled relative who thinks my free time is for his childcare\u2026", "NTA - I'm a parent and there are only a very, very small number of people I would even consider asking to take my kids overnight, let alone for 5 days and none of those would be people who aren't really kid people. Like I would only ask my MIL and my SIL (because she has her own kids and loves having kids around). So it is weird for your sister to ask you in the first place.\n\nSecond, the way she asked the question is rude AF. I remember a friend of my wife's calling one night to ask if we had plans. We said \"no\" thinking that we were going to be invited to go do something fun and then she was like, \"Oh great..hey can I drop my kids of at your house overnight because we have a date and our babysitter canceled?\"  That is a shady way of approaching the matter.\n\nLook I get why your sister is upset about having to cancel her plans but that is not your problem. You are under no obligation to babysit ...let alone for 5 days..that is a huge ask. Furthermore, if you're someone who doesn't even like kids that much to begin with then it's weird that she would even ask you.  \n\nYour sister just needs to deal with the fact that she has kids and her kids are her responsibility.  It sucks for her but it is not your problem.", "NTA. Nobody wants to babysit for 5 days except grandparents. \nIn the future, tell people who ask you to babysit that you don\u2019t like babysitting (or even hate it).", "NTA. She chose to have kids. The kids should be accompanying her on their family trip. Parenting isn't just when you actually want to parent. It's an 18 year commitment. Tell her to plan her solo getaway in 14 years time. if she throws a fit, give her information on nearby adoption centres where she can drop off her children.", "If you aren't comfortable watching kids, you shouldn't watch them.", "NTA looking after kids is a big responsibility and doing that for 5 days when you aren't comfortable isn't a thing to be taken lightly. They could get sick, fall off stairs, get into a fight or maybe choke on something. Unsure how old you are but although it sounds easier to look after 4 and 7 year old, there are things that could go wrong as well. So forcing that responsibility on you is not a nice thing. Your sister could have taken the kids with her or what about the kids dad's family? Also you say your sister's mother, so assume she's your step sister? She can be as mad as she wants and don't take on responsibility you aren't comfortable with. They aren't your kids and they aren't your problem to solve.", "NTA being in charge of two kids for that long is way too stressful. They are not your responsibility. Guess what they are parents it\u2019s their kids. If they can\u2019t find someone else to watch it\u2019s their problem. I hate it when a person is called selfish just because they told other person no. Also the mom got sick a few days before so they had some time to find another babysitter how hard did she really try or did she hope to guilt you into it (a week of free babysitting).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not for her as a sister, nor for her kids, nor for your mom.
