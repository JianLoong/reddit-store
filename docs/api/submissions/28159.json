And I have never in my life heard about any problems with drinking sake and eating rice.\n\nSpecifically on the issue of chopsticks, I \\*do\\* know that there are certain actions with them that Aren't Done in Japan, and spearing food is one of them (though only because it makes you look childish, to the best of my knowledge).  Others include not crossing them and not sticking them upright in a bowl of rice.

That absolutely paints you into a corner and puts you in a no-win scenario where there's nothing you can do because you don't have the same command of chopsticks they do, so NTA for that alone.  But also, 2), I've never known any Japanese person (who isn't an asshole!) to be anything but super-forgiving and understanding when it comes to foreigners making a faux pas like that.  To give an example, there was one day at my job where my boss's father came to visit and help out with some renovations to the school, since he was a carpenter.  At one point, I used some super-casual Japanese to address him.  All the folks at my office were a little taken aback, sure, and they let me know, but they were very nice and forgiving about it.  Obviously, I was and am mortified about it to this day, but they weren't jerks about it at all.\n\nSo technically in this one instance (and seemingly \\*only\\* this one instance, everything else they throw at you sounds like hot bullshit), you did commit a faux pas, but the sort of faux pas that good people would laugh off.

(at better restaurants the chef decides whether to add sushi while making the nigiri, and may use other things like ginger etc if he thinks it's a better match to the fish - adding additional seasonings in that case is like asking for ketchup at a Michelin star French restaurant.)\n\n\\- I don't even know where to start with the dumpling.

That's up there with being angry because you don't put ketchup on your fried potatoes.\n\n\\- Unless your in-laws are ridiculously wealthy sophisticates and you are constantly eating in exclusive Kyoto restaurants, it's common to have a drink with your meal and that goes double for a meal that's supposed to be a celebration. It's true that \"in polite society\" nihonshu would typically be reserved for after the meal if eating at home, but drinking it with a meal, especially a light washoku style of meal, has been common since the Meiji era. \n\nI think I'll forgive them a little for not making an effort at Arabic, since they already speak English well - I studied Arabic (I'm assuming since: Egypt) a bit in graduate school and it's a remarkably hard language for native Japanese speakers. Even so, it's easy to learn shukran, El3afw, anaasfa, etc and not very friendly not to. \n\nBluntly, this sounds like bullying.  You're in Europe so I'm not sure, but here in Japan it would be common for parents to be disappointed their child married a foreigner. Not so common now, but 20 years ago people would often say they worried their daughter would marry a foreigner because \"I'll never see her again\" - it's expected for the woman to enter and fully integrate into her husband's family.

I feel compelled to try them myself", "I'm that guy too!! Cheetos, popcorn and even chips. I hate dirty fingers.", "Thats how I eat chili cheese fries to avoid a mess", "I do this with the big barrel of cheese balls. My ten year old does too. He's way more proficient with chopsticks than I am.", "I eat messy snacks like popcorn with chopsticks! Clean hands :)", "This is a good idea, actually. I may adopt this. Lol", "My dad used to eat cheese popcorn with a spoon for the same reason!", "I do this. Works well with popcorn too!", "As one should.", "That's what I do. It's so much better than getting cheeto goop all over your hands.", "I may need to try this with Takis. The stain and smell seem to last through multiple very thorough handwashings.", "I\u2019ve done that, too. The perfect Cheeto hack for sure!", "You know my kid?", "OR maybe he's just classy?", "It's so much better to eat cheetos (and chips albeit a bit harder) with chopsticks. Otherwise your fingers get so sticky and powdery, I love eating my snacks with chopsticks!", "I have a friend who made sterling silver cheeto tongs. She's remarkable. And talented.", "My daughter does this w Cheetos and Doritos", "Taught my gkids to eat Takis that way!", "Finger chopsticks for snacks are literally a thing you can buy https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IiQyxJ1rL.jpg", "I thought this was a common practice.", "I do that at work. And my chopstick skills have really improved since I started.", "My 13 yo does the same with her cheetos!", "I do the same thing any time I have my nails done so the dust doesn\u2019t get all under them", "...i eat Cheetos, Doritos & Taki with chopsticks to avoid the dust.", "I've eaten cheetos this way since I was a child, I'm in my 40's now and still do this, lol.", "I'm currently eating jalape\u00f1o cheddar Cheetos using chopsticks. I hate getting the dust on my fingers!", "But the eventual finger sludge is the best part...", "It is a great show!", "My father-in-law (refined, upper class Italian) always said that only children eat with their hands.", "The first time I used a knife and fork for pizza was when I'd gotten my lip pierced 30 minutes earlier and it swelled up like a balloon. But this place did proper nice woodfired pizza in Glasgow and I didn't want to miss out. I quite like citlery for pizza now. Makes it easier to eat", "I do it all the time! Especially if it's thin crust or a big slice that's kinda droopy. I HATE getting food on my hands, grosses me out. I won't even eat fried chicken cause there's no way to do it without getting greasy yuck on me!", "Alright, you get a pass. \ud83d\ude09", "Wow! Getting so upset over me stating an opinion. Yes, chopsticks were invented in China. Japan adopted them. Guess what? Most of Asia adopted it as well. I am sure many other areas have rules about proper etiquette on those \"cheap ass sticks.\" And there is fork etiquette too!! \n\nIt's rude to yell in a restaurant. I stated that it was also considered rude to use the chopsticks improperly. I answered the question stated in the title. I didn't let any external factors outside of the situation influence my opinion. \n\nMy snobby asshole self is now off to bed.  Guten Nacht!", "I was with you on the SIL being racist part but how are you better when you're  also being an AH towards a culture and the utensils they use? \n\nJapan may not invented chopsticks and dumplings but they have adapted them and their versions are actually... *gasp* Japanese.", "Good for you in maintaining boundaries. I haven\u2019t spoken to my father in years because he called my fianc\u00e9 (then boyfriend) a racial epithet. It was definitely a straw that broke the camel\u2019s back situation, but I don\u2019t have room for that kind of hate in my life.", "I once forgot to label my spice jars and tried to gently sniff to identify. Ended up snorting chipotle powder like it was cocaine. The burn lasted for days.", "My 4 year old love Cheeto puffs but can\u2019t stand her hands getting dirty. She makes us feed them to her. Seriously trying to teach her to use chopsticks for this purpose alone", "I recently had to go to the doctor for something like this. My testicles had turned orange during the past weekend. \nDuring my checkup my Dr what if I had any hobbies. I said no, I just masturbate and eat Cheetos.", "But the best part of Cheetos is scraping the thick salty orange cheese coating off your fingers with your teeth", "Me: putting chopsticks on the shopping list.", "That\u2019s how I eat those chocolate covered ice cream bars. I have to let it sit for just a few minutes, just long enough for the ice cream to get soft, but the chocolate stays crips. Now I want a dilly bar.", "Also do this when there are only tortilla chip crumbs left with salsa.  It's like cereal! But better!", "Don't the chips get soggy though? I like the idea in theory, but all I can think of are those sad, soggy chips at the bottom of the nacho plate.", "I absolutely HATE putting my hand into a sticky food bag!

In all my years working there, this is the first time I have heard this word describing the coating of the best snack food ever invented.", "Cheedle sounds really gross to me.  Immediately reminded me of *smegma* \n\nI'm sorry.", "That\u2019s wild. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is Japanese American and they manage to not give a shit how I eat food. I mean they occasionally gently rib me if I eat some foods with a fork, but they certainly don\u2019t actually care.\n\nWhich is good cuz his mom\u2019s sukiyaki is amazing, but I still haven\u2019t nailed the noodle soup with chopsticks skill lol.", "My dad and I both learned how to use chopsticks with popcorn at the movies. I use them for ramen and sushi, sure, but also for popcorn and cheetos.", "In all seriousness, that's how I eat Cheerios.  I've eaten them like that since I was a child.  I like them better dry than with milk.", "Yes! That too!", "Not if I don't make too much and don't waste time eating them. If I get distracted, then yeah. But I mostly do it with fritos and stuff and I don't get mushy chips. They do absorb some of the dip but I use less than I would if I was dipping them individually so that helps too", "Crumbled pita chips in hummus. Cheese coated chips in the salsa. Toss an avocado in there and that's dinner.", "I think you mean finger condoms...", "I was in KFC in Bangkok and the locals were all eating  the chicken with cutlery,It was quite amusing.", "I know that feeling well enough.", "I have been there omg \ud83d\ude2c", "Op's life is pretty crappy now but imagine how worse it would get if she had a child with this man? They care so much about how she eats her food, no way would they support her as a mother.", "I used to play D&D with a guy who would eat pizza with chopsticks. We asked why he didn\u2019t just pick it up and eat it, since that is how pizza is designed to be eaten, and he just said that he didn\u2019t want to get his hands greasy.", "Reminds me of years ago getting dim sum in a Chinese restaurant. My large white party was seated at the same table as a large Chinese party. One white guy picked up a fork, turned to the Chinese man sitting next to him and asked *Can you tell me how to use this?\" EVERYBODY laughed.", "I don't blame you for still being ticked off", "This just had me literally lol \ud83d\ude02", "Gotta use the roll-on!", "I remember when i was around 10 years old at my grandma's for xmas, my grandad had done something that day to irritate Mema and so later that night he was getting out of the shower and she was in the bathroom and she put a bunch of icy hot in her hand and straight up credit card swiped my grandads asscrack. Me and my cousin was in the living room watching TV and I just remember us looking up to see grandad with a towel around his waist shagging ass out the back door to go drop his bare ass in the snow lmao I still laugh when I think about it. Mema was spiteful like that, creative. She used to put little marble sized lead balls in the freezer and if one of us kids over slept for school or church she would take the cup of frozen lead balls and dump them under the covers with us. No matter which way you go, on that mattress the balls will follow you lol and sometimes they'd stick to ya if you were damp from sweating or something. Ahh memories", "Or support her teaching her child about her own heritage! They'd co-opt the kid as Japanese only and ignore the fact that OP is Egyptian", "I am so curious about the logistics for this. Did he just pick up the whole slice with the chopsticks? Did he cut it into pieces first? If he cut it, did he steady the pizza with a chopstick and cut with a knife or did he also use a fork? Or did he just use a pizza cutter? \n\nSorry, this is so ridiculous. Idek why I find it interesting.", "Samsies", "I clinched, omfg. That had to be horrid. You poor beb.", "Did you know a tube of toothpaste and a tube of icy hot are almost exactly alike when the lights are dimmed? Yes. That happened here.", "This is a pro tip right here..^", "Just picked up a whole slice and ate it. There is nothing more fascinating than watching someone pickup a slice and eating it with a couple of pieces of bamboo."]}
