Others include not crossing them and not sticking them upright in a bowl of rice.  So yeah, you technically made a cultural faux pas there.\n\nBut that doesn't matter for two big reasons.  1) They were on your case about the fork.  That absolutely paints you into a corner and puts you in a no-win scenario where there's nothing you can do because you don't have the same command of chopsticks they do, so NTA for that alone.  But also, 2), I've never known any Japanese person (who isn't an asshole!) to be anything but super-forgiving and understanding when it comes to foreigners making a faux pas like that.  To give an example, there was one day at my job where my boss's father came to visit and help out with some renovations to the school, since he was a carpenter.  At one point, I used some super-casual Japanese to address him.  All the folks at my office were a little taken aback, sure, and they let me know, but they were very nice and forgiving about it.  Obviously, I was and am mortified about it to this day, but they weren't jerks about it at all.\n\nSo technically in this one instance (and seemingly \\*only\\* this one instance, everything else they throw at you sounds like hot bullshit), you did commit a faux pas, but the sort of faux pas that good people would laugh off.

Stabbing food with chopsticks, (it is bad luck, extremely rude, and poor manners) leaving your chopsticks stuck in your food in the bowl, (this does symbolise death) waving your chopsticks around while gesturing, using them to point with...all cardinal sins of Japanese etiquette, and are akin to chewing with your mouth open or grabbing food from others' plates.\n\nWhat you have is a serious culture clash, OP. Did your husband not explain his culture to you?  In Japan, a woman marries into her husband's family, and as the wife of an eldest son, you are a representative of the family you now belong to, and their honor.  While I will admit they could be going about it in a kinder manner, they are teaching you what your position in their family and their culture entails.  You said they've never learned your language or tried your foods.  Have you offered to make your foods?  Explain your culture? Tell them, for instance, \"you say this in Japanese, we say this in my language\"?\n\nYou need to sit down with your husband and have a serious discussion about your marriage, your cultures, your roles, and expectations thereof.  Then you both need to sit down with his family and have a discussion, *in which he, as eldest son, speaks up for you*, so that there is clear understanding on both sides.  If nobody is willing to do this, there's not much hope for a better future.  Blending two cultures in marriage is all about compromise, and it has to come from both sides.  You need to realise and understand they are Japanese and have a specific culture with specific rules. *They* need to realise and understand that *you are not Japanese* and cannot know what you haven't been told about their culture, and that you have, and will not abandon, your own culture as well.", "She doesn\u2019t owe them that.

If he told them to stop, they would.\n\nBut he doesn't. Because he thinks what they are doing isn't a problem. Because he doesn't care that they treat you this way. Because he would rather not offend them than stand up for you.\n\nActions speak louder than words. Ultimately, your husband's actions tell you that he agrees with them, you haven't done enough, you just aren't good enough to warrant him ending this abuse.\n\nYou need to have a \"come to Jesus\" meeting w/ your husband and determine if this is how you want to live the rest of your life. Relatedly, this will only get worse if/when you have children. They will either treat your children like shit or double down on treating you like shit and try to get your children to hate you too. They will question every decision you make and make your life miserable, and your husband WILL NOT step up if you keep going as you are.", "Then talk to your husband *You have a husband problem*.", "There\u2019s nothing you can do.

Tell them that in Egyptian culture only uncoached morons look into someone else's mouth.  from wikipedia: The Principle of Least Interest is the idea in sociology that the person or group that has the least amount of interest in continuing a relationship has the most power over it.

Although stereotype, their family sounds like they fit the mold\n\nYou assimilated into a patriarchal culture.  The identity of the woman is irrelevant.
