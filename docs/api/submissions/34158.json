This is because he will fall in love with a TV show, character, singer, or a an actor, and become them.\n\nFor example, when he was younger he fell in love with spiderman, he wouldnt answer to anything but peter parker no matter what u did. He took a picture of andrew garfield from his laptop and u could see his reflection in the computer screen with the flash on LMFAO. He has also become justin bieber, and the flash in the past too. Usually someone would find a hole in his story and then it would all come undone and he just becomes himself again.\n\nThis in itself was never really a problem, but recently he has fallen in love with kpop, and there is a famous singer that is about 26 years old, so he is now 26 years old too (in reality he is 16). This is a big problem when he interacts with people, girls especially. He has told multiple girls around his actual age that he is 26 and he has a crush on them.\n\nPeople believe him because when they question his date of birth, he has an answer. It is so believable because he literally has an explanation for almost any question thrown his way.\n\nObviously alot of people have gotten upset at my aunt, and our family for allowing him to behave this way as an \"adult\" when in reality he is just a kid and he's just expressing his feelings.\n\nI hang out with him a lot and Ive finally found a way to break his character. He has an older brother who is only 24, so whenever I catch him lying about his age I ask him how old his brother is and he answer 24, then I ask who is older to which he replies his brother, then finally I ask him how old he is and he says 26, then he has a brain fart and then sits there for a bit and then finally admits hes lying.\n\nI dont know why, but he still hasnt caught on to my trick and so now whenever I need to confirm his age with a parent or something I just use that exact script and all is good.\n\nPeople are saying this isnt the right way to deal with his delusions, some people are calling me a jerk for making him look stupid like that and trying to embarass him.\n\nIm just his cousin, I do what I can. I know this isnt a permanent solution but in the meantime I think this is pretty good. Is this fucked up?

Because that's not a .... terrible way of self expression, but its not good either.", "NTA because I worry he will say he is 26 to the wrong person, be believed,  get himself into trouble and then what? Family says oh well? It isn't up to you to do anything but I worry about him. He is still a minor.", "Info. Under what circumstances are you forcing him to admit he\u2019s lying? Why do you need to confirm his age with a parent or something?", ">People are saying this isnt the right way to deal with his delusions, some people are calling me a jerk for making him look stupid like that and trying to embarass him.\n\n\n\nWhat people?

If wants to pretend to be Spiderman, how does it affect your life? \n\nYou say he is 16. Lots of teens lie about their age. So that's not so weird. \n\nHow old is he developmentally? That makes a huge difference. When one of my kids was in preschool, he would become different characters, too. He wouldn't respond unless you called him by the character name, etc. Vivid imagination! We rolled with it because it was developmentally appropriate. Not sure where your cousin is in terms of cognitive development.  \n\nHis parents have him in therapy. That sounds like are trying to help him manage his disability.  They aren't ignoring. Often, with developmental disabilities, there are many issues to manage. Some issues get put on the back burner. Perhaps the therapist is working on this with him or thinks there are other more pressing issues. \n\nBottom line: it is not your job to break him of this habit. He has a LOT to cope with. If this makes him happy or feel more confident, leave him alone. Why is it so important to you to catch him in a lie? Does it make you feel smarter?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not really sure how its going because they've been working with him for almost 2 years now and no change. They dont really tell me much and I only ever really call him out when its happening in person and the problem needs to be solved right away to avoid unnecessary situations.", "I think the issue is that the parents are letting him think a 26 year old can flirt with teenagers which can become a real problem when he actually becomes an adult. What will his aunt do for him when he tries this with the wrong kid. She's opening him up to be hurt in a way where people around him would stop showing him any empathy thinking he's some kind of sexual predator, which could very likely happen if his family doesn't lay down some boundaries. What if one day he decides he wants to be a cop or something else that can get himself into serious trouble for faking.", "INFO: Is he upset when you use this method with him?\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t really get upset, I\u2019d say NTA. Doesn\u2019t hurt anything and might actually help him.\n\nIf he does get upset, I\u2019d say slightly YTA. I will cut you a lot of slack because you sound like a great cousin who enjoys hanging out with him\u2026 That\u2019s not something to take for granted and makes me happy to hear. But really\u2026 Since his age is very easy to legally prove (so he can\u2019t get in legal trouble if he approaches someone his age as an \u201cadult\u201d, I\u2019d be tempted to let him have his harmless fun.

Some people get an automatic pass. Your cousin is one of them. Be kind!", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. If he is too convincing about being 26 with the wrong person, it\u2019ll lead to statutory charges for someone.", "Because he's telling teenage girls that he's a 26 year old man that has a crush on them/is attracted to them, when in reality he is near their own age.", "Because teenagers (and those responsible for them) react very differently to the idea of a 16 year old having a crush on a 16 year old than to a 26 year old having a crush on a 16 year old, and might be more likely to call the cops or something."]}
