And my wife believed it and since then she has been sad and has asked me more than once if I find her attractive, and the truth is that she is still as hot as she was 17 years ago when we started dating. She may have gained a little more weight from giving birth to our three children (9F, 6M, 5F) but she's still beautiful and the only woman I have eyes for. And I told her that but I know it's hard for her to believe it because her mother has a lot of power over her and she always believes the stupid things she says.\n\nMy wife went to the gym again and has lost weight, more than I would have wanted to be honest, and yesterday when we went to pick up her mom at the airport, she told her to see how much weight she lost and her mom just said that it's not that noticeable yet, but that she appreciates the effort she's making. Now she's 125lbs being a pretty tall woman so it's really noticeable how much weight she lost, that's why I don't know why her mom lied.\n\nWhen she told her that, all the happiness that my wife had had for months vanished, and that hurt me because I know she was excited to tell her and show her that. But since she didn't say anything, I kept quiet and they started talking about something else. Well, for dinner my wife ate what she always eats, which is healthy but it's a lot of food, because she doesn't go on a strict diet, she just focuses on exercising. And of course her mother told her that this was too much food to make her feel bad, and when she said that my wife got sad and said she wasn't hungry anymore. And that's when I got fed up and told my mother-in-law to pack up her things and leave my house, that I'm not going to allow her to make my wife feel bad, that I also don't want my daughters to grow up listening to her talk like that about the weight of others, that she can only come back here when she has received all the therapy that she clearly needs. I called an Uber and sent her to a hotel.\n\nMy wife was angry at first but then she thanked me and said that she wanted to do that for a long time but she didn't dare, and that's all I care about. But now my brothers-in-law are accusing me of being an asshole for kicking their mom out in the middle of the night, that that was irresponsible of me and stuff like that, but honestly I don't regret a thing so am i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1675026690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10oir3q/aita_for_kicking_my_motherinlaw_out_of_my_house/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did what you should have done. 125lbs is a healthy weight for a lot of women (4\u20199\u201d-5\u201911\u201d at least) so unless your wife is 4 feet tall and 125lbs then it\u2019s not really an issue is it?\n\nYour MIL is horrendous and you did the right thing.
