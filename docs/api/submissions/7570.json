Look after yourself.", "Her and his dad divorced after being married for like 26 years. After that, he took on her emotional baggage.

I had to explain to him what emotional incest was.", "This is the answer.", "It\u2019s so ironic that you said that because he actually respects the fact that I don\u2019t want to speak to her. It\u2019s like he takes abuse from her so I won\u2019t have to. It\u2019s so strange, even through I told him he shouldn\u2019t be treated that way.", "There\u2019s so much trauma there. Sometimes when she calls, you can see the life drain out of his eyes. It\u2019s scary.", "That's unfortunately codependency and common for victims of abuse. He probably needs therapy to address keeping his mom's toxic behavior at length for his own mental health and sanity", "Talk to him about *that*. Does he have insurance? Can you help him look for mental health support? He's suffering at the hands of a parent with very blatant NPD. He is likely a Fawn, a people pleaser, isn't he. He may end up with a codependent personality, unable to ever be alone.\n\nWhy tf your aunt have anything to do with this btw? My aunt talked shit about my husband to my grandfather and I haven't spoken to her in 7 years because of it. You put your foot down, it stays there.", "NTA.  But the main problem is your boyfriend, because he doesn't stand up for himself and for you, and he dumps all this on you, instead of manning up and handling his mother, and enfircing clear and strict boundaries.", "NTA.  BF's Mom is the one mentally ill.  Ask your BF, what role does she really play when it comes to ya'll getting married?  Is he going to continue to let her act this way towards HIM, using YOU as an excuse?   If he is upset at you after visiting her and then lashes out at you, versus protecting and defending you, you have a big RED FLAG.", "NTA. I've never been a fan of cancer before but \n...", "Respect between adults is earned.  As someone who had a mother and a MIL like you describe (I swear we need a club), our experience is that no matter what you do, you will never be good enough and your MIL will abuse her son emotionally.

Of course his mother is unhinged, and the behavior screams narcissist, BUT he has never stood up for you. Yes, he \"respects\" you not wanting to go there to constantly get verbally abused BUT he tells you about all the insults, won't (not can't) say no to her, and is still visiting and letting her insult you. \n\nIn short, he is choosing his mother over basic decency and respect for his partner. Also, who knows, if he had told her straight \"the next time you insult my partner in any way, I will stop visiting\" maybe she'd have had a reality check. And if not, following up on it would have given you and him a much needed mental break from the abuse. \n\nThe question for you is, are you ready to live your life with a guy that will not defend/respect you, and will do his mommy's bidding at your expense. I know I wouldn't.", "Have him look on the raised by narcissists subreddit. I've found it immensely helpful", "It\u2019s good that you are aware of this.

Then says she loves him, demands his attendance and then verbally abuse him\u2026.Point out to him that this is totally inconsistent! She sounds unhinged, mentally ill. \n\nShe needs treatment, and he needs therapy to learn how to stand up to her and say no, I am not coming over because you abuse me - and for the years of abuse she has inflicted.", "NTA", "NTA and your bf better start standing up to her.", "OP your bf will eventually become your SO.

You\u2019ve gone no-contact with this woman. That\u2019s allowed (and sounds like it was a great idea). You\u2019ll have to tell your BF the topic is off limits.
