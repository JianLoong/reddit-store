Can you help him look for mental health support? He's suffering at the hands of a parent with very blatant NPD. He is likely a Fawn, a people pleaser, isn't he.

My aunt talked shit about my husband to my grandfather and I haven't spoken to her in 7 years because of it. You put your foot down, it stays there."]}
