I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it\u2019s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don\u2019t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another \u201cgift\u201d was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil\n\nThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they\u2019d like didn\u2019t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about mine, I said there wasn\u2019t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I\u2019m making a big deal about it and I\u2019d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.\n\nNot wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn\u2019t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf\u2019s parent\u2019s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I\u2019m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving?

You are the only one to only get 'joke' presents, your actual presents were given away to family members. You family sound cruel.

Every single gift I opened was a prank where the joke was that you actually didn\u2019t get me something I would like, but something intentionally got to upset me. My hope is that you all just didn\u2019t realize that every single gift given to me was meant as a joke. But it was, every single one. It isn\u2019t being ungrateful to be disappointed in that, and I think you all know that.

Tell them you regret the reason why your mother is sad because she pretended to gift you things you wanted, but really gifted them to other people and gave you the wrappers to get your hopes up.

One prank gift or prank gifts followed by the real gifts are OK, but what your family did was malice", "NTA\nIf any one of them would have gotten all joke gifts would they feel the same?

It\u2019s a good fun tradition, and nobody loses out because actual gifts are still in those cat food boxes, it\u2019s just a bit of misdirection. In fact my FIL gets pretty creative with it sometimes and we all have a laugh.\n\nBut it sounds like your family has missed the point of a joke present. It\u2019s supposed to be a harmless joke that makes everyone (including the recipient, I might add!) laugh for a few minutes before getting on with the rest of the gift exchanging. A joke present isn\u2019t when you buy one person an expensive gift and give the box to someone else, that\u2019s plain weird behaviour. The fact they did that for all your gifts is cruel.\n\nSo, NTA and I\u2019d stop being involved in your family\u2019s gift giving until they see how hurtful it has been for you.", "NTA: your family suck for not giving you some proper gifts as well, like they did with your other family members. Also I think it is so trashy of your mum to pretend she gave you a book you wanted, then admit that she gave it away to someone else.", "NTA, you are owed a massive apology. You are not being childish, selfish, or ungrateful, you are reacting to being treated differently to everyone else.

Well if that\u2019s true you have EVERY RIGHT to be hurt and upset because the only \u201cthought\u201d they put into your gifts was in itself a joke.

And when they start that thought that counts bullshit I\u2019d ask them exactly what that \u201cthought\u201d actually was! They probably haven\u2019t apologized either!

I would have been pissed as well. You spent money, time, and a lot of thought on the gift you got them and they gave you: a \"charger block\" but was actually two gift cards with a zero balance, a cover of a book you wanted around a dictionary, and chocolate inside of a macbook box. Is there a reason why they would treat you like this? (not that this is your fault at all.) But I feel like they have a motive for treating everyone else well, but giving you jack shit. For sure NTA and I think for Christmas next year, give them the gift of you going low or no contact. \n\nP.S.

We gift them a very very big box, with a slightly smaller box inside, with a smaller box inside, etc. until the last one which containt a big bill.\n\nYou only had the boxes without the bill, it's funny only for the mean people who gifted that to you.

Did they consult with each other so they knew you'd get all the \"gag\" gifts because it seems very odd that all of yours were cr*ppy. That would be even worse if that was the case.

I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it\u2019s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don\u2019t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another \u201cgift\u201d was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil\n\nThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they\u2019d like didn\u2019t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about mine, I said there wasn\u2019t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I\u2019m making a big deal about it and I\u2019d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.\n\nNot wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn\u2019t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf\u2019s parent\u2019s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I\u2019m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I\u2019m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Come Christmas morning (we were going to theirs later in the day) my dad opened the lighter fluid first... then spent the next hour extremely confused because he didn't own a lighter that used it! The real gift ended up being the very last thing he opened! The thing is, my nana was already known for buying bizarre and entirely spontaneous gifts (think a stuffed meerkat for someone who has never indicated that they like meerkats - it was cute, golf balls for someone who doesn't golf - she thought they were for crazy golf! Or a pair of salt and pepper pots for someone allegic to pepper - reasoning was they weren't allergic to salt and... they were cute, and many, many gifts bought for one person then accidentally wrapped up and given to another... we spent many Christmases playing 'swap the gift' without telling her.) So, my dad genuinely thought she'd either got confused and thought he had one that needed it, or that it was meant for someone else! But then, he got the real gift and it's now a nostalgic story to tell. Another example is my dad buying my fianc\u00e9 a game that he REALLY wanted, but for a console he didn't own. My fianc\u00e9 was incredibly gracious when my dad arrived and he gently told him he'd got the wrong one. My dad went: \"Really?

Just buy everything you actually want.", "How about toilet paper,  deodorant", "100%", "exactly. you wrote my thoughts exactly that i couldn't form into words. it was just a huge asshole slight in her direction and then gaslighting to make her think that SHE is the problem. they're the problem and it's a shitty time of year to do that to someone 100%", "The only good reason for this collective \"prank\" would be a planned reveal of a really big gift, like a car, that they'd bought together for OP.", "That's a really good point- this degree of fuckery definitely points to collusion", "*And if you're parents are loaded and gift you a dollar store chocolate when you could use a new laptop, you are right to be disappointed that they have the mean to please/help you but would rather not.*\n\nEspecially when they don't eat chocolate and the family would absolutely know that.  I think they were amazing that they didn't start crying.  I think I would have done.  To be shown how much they really don't care would be devastating.", "You are quite right that expectations around giving and receiving gifts are normal in many cultures around the world - it's one of the hallmarks that social anthropologists use to interpret society.\n\nIt's why some families have a discussion about changing the \"rules\" when children become independent adults. Such as agreeing a spending limit for presents for adults, or switching to doing a secret santa, or mutually agreeing to forgo gifts altogether and instead give to charity.\n\nBut the key factor would be to have a  clear dialogue, for everyone to agree and for it to apply to everyone \n\nWhich is not the case here. So OP is entitled to feel slighted as this was a change in gift etiquette only targeting them.\n\nThe only possible justification would be if OP had routinely only given exclusively joke gifts for a number of years, and this was a \"taste if your own medicine\" situation. But that does not sound like the case at all.", "Yeah thanks for the dictionary. I looked up \u201cbullying\u201d and saw a picture of you guys.", "She should post a series of \"thank you\" posts with pics of all these shitty gifts so that everyone can see how bad it actually was.", "My fam sometimes does a \u201cjoke gift\u201d, but it\u2019s A joke, followed by a real one, not a carrousel of sucker punches followed by \u201cwhy u mad bro?\u201d", "Yeah... no argument there. I do not see how that is still funny beyond the first time you do it. \n\nYears ago, we gifted a friend assorted tabletop gaming dice for his birthday. We bought around 250 dice, and spend an hour or two packing them all individually. It took him almost as long to unpack them all alone. In that case, the prank was in the massive overwrapping; he still got a present he wanted.", "Right, I would ask exactly what gift should I be thankful for. Or is just being the butt of the joke?", "I can\u2019t believe the major disparity in price points on her gifts like come on ok the Mac book joke is funny if you then don\u2019t give the hundreds of dollars laptop to your other sibling while you\u2019re left with the box and a chocolate bar. That shit mean as hell.", "My Christmas \"pranks\" are usually just making a present hard to open.  Zip ties woven around the box, covering the whole thing with packing tape, gift card inside a cryptex, etc.  They will get their thoughtful present eventually but it usually involves borrowing a knife.", "My daughter nearly threw away $60 on Christmas when she was helping clean up.  My husband was the one that found it in the trash and gave it back to her.", "I agree this family is showing toxic signs. Super uncomfortable feelings seeing a family hurt someone then demand an apology from them for being hurt. Jokes should make everyone laugh or feel included. Their \"jokes\" very much excluded OP, and it wasn't just one, which seems to be family tradition. It was piled on. They all took a turn at excluding OP with their gift. Then blamed her for feeling excluded. \n\nIf mom's upset, it's for her own actions, and she needs to own up to that.  She chose to exclude her kid and think it was funny that they all did it on a family holiday. She should feel bad. But OP is not in charge of making other people feel better for their self-inflicted wounds. They all seem to lack the empathy necessary to realize why this was hurtful. OP is NTA.", "Happy Cake Day", "Most of the prank presents were the packaging and labeling that came from other people's gifts. They gave OP wrapped trash to open, for the most part. \n\nReminds me of the year I was given socks and a pair of sneakers. Not a big deal if the socks and shoes were for me, but they were for my much younger brother (7) when I was 16. He had a huge stack of presents. I was given those two to open for the pictures. My name was on those presents. That was the last Christmas I celebrated with my family before having a family of my own.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Mention that she received a joke gift about the item for some of the real gifts, which she had to watch others receive.", "This! They won't want anyone to know what they did because they all know it is bad. When she left it emphasized how bad it was. They wanted her to stay and act like being bullied, because let's face, this wasn't funny, was a good Christmas with her family.\n\nI think some public humiliation would be good for them. If she took the \"gifts\" they gave her and posted them one by one on social media so that everyone could see how awful the entire family was they might be forced to change. Then she lays down her requirements about what they do if they want to see her again.\n\nNo going to see them for Easter or spring break. No seeing them in the summer. She needs to go no contact for a while.", "Yep! This. Let the court of social media rule!  Maybe then they will think twice", "Some bridges should be burned", "Exactly this. This suggestion being added is going to cause more problems than it will ever help since it's childish and petty. \n\nThe originally suggested response let's them know OP's feelings and puts the next actions in their hands without belittling them or being dramatic or childish. Which doesn't give them an excuse to ignore the actual message and issue by pointing to OP being petty/childish. \n\nUnfortunately, OP is going to have to be ready to accept that their family members may react to this poorly and still blame her for being disappointed by their behavior, but at least then she knows where she stands with them and can make decisions about it from there.", "In front of her. And mom gave her the book cover and other person gets the book. Brother gave her the package of the MacBook with a chocolate in it and other sibling the MacBook. And after asking during dinner and tell her to relax because se said she was unhappy because she got only prank gifts and dont give her then a real gift i have to say thats was on purpose and cruel and bullying and so fucking mean I would have left the family with very clear words why I am done with them. And the family thinks she is the problem!!", "None of them are children - sounds like the book went to the SIL", "That was my point. She doesn\u2019t owe any of them an apology.", "Regift the \u2018joke\u2019 gifts from this year back to them", "Then gift them the box / cover wrapped around a dictionary.", "I can\u2019t imagine how that day felt. My heart would be breaking wondering why my entire family decided to bully me on Christmas and then expect me to just be ok with it.", "Agreed", "the Jerk Store called, and they're running out of you", "\"I am so grateful for the thoughtfulness of my family!\" then a picture of each gift with a mention of who gave it.  \"My thoughtful mom gave me ...\"", "This here!!", "I was looking for this one. The best way would be to do this. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for the gifts from my family!\u201d And let people make their own decisions. It\u2019s passive aggressive, yes, but it will publicly shame them. The court of public opinion isn\u2019t on their side at all.", "But at least you soften the blow of a joke gift with a real gift. You understand a joke but this family don\u2019t, they are just cruel. To give someone a fake MacBook and then give someone else the real thing, that\u2019s laughing in her face", "Yeah, and not only they didn't give her anything, but they bought the things she wanted and gave them to someone else, how mean is that?? They couldn't give her a book, seriously??", "Yeah, that's how you do it.\n\nMy brother usually just wants money towards whatever new tech thing he wants, so one year I got his gift in all $1 bills and then bought play money that was the right size and made origami birds out of all of them and wrapped that up and made him search. Another year mom and I wrapped money in empty candy wrappers mixed in with real candy and put it all in a pi\u00f1ata and made him open that. Blindfold and everything \ud83d\ude02. The key is, *he was laughing too*", "I mean the mac book box with shitty chocolate inside IS funny.... IF YOU THEN 5 MINUTES LATER GIVE ME THE MAC BOOK! but to actually NOT....ridiculous! Ditto with the book. Fake cover over a dictionary is funny if you then say \"only joking\" and give the actual book. Especially as you spent money on actual gifts. I really would never exchange gifts with these people again which means I wouldn't want to around when they are all giving gifts.\n\nTheir humour is like saying \"I'm gonna punch you just for a joke\" then hitting you so hard it breaks your face. It's not funny it's abuse.", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the first time. She\u2019s 21 and her siblings are 29-37. I bet she\u2019s been picked on plenty just because she\u2019s so much younger.", "This is brilliant", "Same! It if were me, I would be a pile of tears and turning in on myself just to hide from the world and the bullshit. Christmas is suppose to be magical and fun for everyone :-(", "Public shaming might be the only thing that gets through to these people.", "100%\n\nThey missed the good part of the joke, which was to actually include OP in the joke by also giving her something she wanted rather than just making her the butt of the joke.", "Yeah, there\u2019s a difference between a harmless joke gift and this very deliberate, cruel stuff."]}
