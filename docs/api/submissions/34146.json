I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it\u2019s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don\u2019t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another \u201cgift\u201d was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil\n\nThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they\u2019d like didn\u2019t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about mine, I said there wasn\u2019t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I\u2019m making a big deal about it and I\u2019d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.\n\nNot wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn\u2019t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf\u2019s parent\u2019s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I\u2019m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I\u2019m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them.\n\n\n*Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn\u2019t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn\u2019t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn\u2019t get a real present that is all. Another thing I\u2019ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last \u201cbig argument\u201d I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I\u2019m at work. Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven\u2019t participated in the last 10+ years because I didn\u2019t enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know). I will reply with more info if needed when I\u2019m on break or have time to reply. - and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don\u2019t fully understand so I will research that as well.

They treated you as a joke for Christmas, A joke is not a joke if the person it is aimed at does not find it funny. Honestly it comes across as bullying. You are the only one to only get 'joke' presents, your actual presents were given away to family members. You family sound cruel.

I understand that mom is sad that I left on Christmas, but you need to understand that you all made me sad on Christmas day. I did not receive a single thoughtful gift from you guys. Not one. Every single gift I opened was a prank where the joke was that you actually didn\u2019t get me something I would like, but something intentionally got to upset me. My hope is that you all just didn\u2019t realize that every single gift given to me was meant as a joke. But it was, every single one. It isn\u2019t being ungrateful to be disappointed in that, and I think you all know that.

One prank gift or prank gifts followed by the real gifts are OK, but what your family did was malice", "NTA\nIf any one of them would have gotten all joke gifts would they feel the same?

It\u2019s a good fun tradition, and nobody loses out because actual gifts are still in those cat food boxes, it\u2019s just a bit of misdirection. In fact my FIL gets pretty creative with it sometimes and we all have a laugh.\n\nBut it sounds like your family has missed the point of a joke present. It\u2019s supposed to be a harmless joke that makes everyone (including the recipient, I might add!) laugh for a few minutes before getting on with the rest of the gift exchanging. A joke present isn\u2019t when you buy one person an expensive gift and give the box to someone else, that\u2019s plain weird behaviour. The fact they did that for all your gifts is cruel.\n\nSo, NTA and I\u2019d stop being involved in your family\u2019s gift giving until they see how hurtful it has been for you.", "NTA: your family suck for not giving you some proper gifts as well, like they did with your other family members. Also I think it is so trashy of your mum to pretend she gave you a book you wanted, then admit that she gave it away to someone else.", "NTA, you are owed a massive apology.

Well if that\u2019s true you have EVERY RIGHT to be hurt and upset because the only \u201cthought\u201d they put into your gifts was in itself a joke.

You spent money, time, and a lot of thought on the gift you got them and they gave you: a \"charger block\" but was actually two gift cards with a zero balance, a cover of a book you wanted around a dictionary, and chocolate inside of a macbook box. Is there a reason why they would treat you like this? (not that this is your fault at all.) But I feel like they have a motive for treating everyone else well, but giving you jack shit. For sure NTA and I think for Christmas next year, give them the gift of you going low or no contact. \n\nP.S.

I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it\u2019s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don\u2019t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another \u201cgift\u201d was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil\n\nThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they\u2019d like didn\u2019t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about mine, I said there wasn\u2019t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I\u2019m making a big deal about it and I\u2019d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.\n\nNot wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn\u2019t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf\u2019s parent\u2019s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents.

Come Christmas morning (we were going to theirs later in the day) my dad opened the lighter fluid first... then spent the next hour extremely confused because he didn't own a lighter that used it! The real gift ended up being the very last thing he opened! The thing is, my nana was already known for buying bizarre and entirely spontaneous gifts (think a stuffed meerkat for someone who has never indicated that they like meerkats - it was cute, golf balls for someone who doesn't golf - she thought they were for crazy golf! Or a pair of salt and pepper pots for someone allegic to pepper - reasoning was they weren't allergic to salt and... they were cute, and many, many gifts bought for one person then accidentally wrapped up and given to another... we spent many Christmases playing 'swap the gift' without telling her.) So, my dad genuinely thought she'd either got confused and thought he had one that needed it, or that it was meant for someone else! But then, he got the real gift and it's now a nostalgic story to tell. Another example is my dad buying my fianc\u00e9 a game that he REALLY wanted, but for a console he didn't own. My fianc\u00e9 was incredibly gracious when my dad arrived and he gently told him he'd got the wrong one. My dad went: \"Really?

None of this is normal or even your fault.", "But it turns out your mom didn't get you anything...that alone is so mean!", "I'd probably send something like this in your group chat, and then set Do Not Disturb for a bit:\n\n\"I was the only person in the family this year who received *only* joke gifts while the rest of you got to open thought out, genuine gifts after only a few joke gifts of their own. I do not understand why I need to explain to an entire group of full grown adults, two of which include *my own parents* why this was so hurtful. I got you all genuine gifts myself, and *no one* returned the favor to me. Clearly and obviously, this joke tradition has gotten out of hand, and I am *telling* you all now that I no longer want to participate in this tradition. Full stop. The end. I will not be arguing this. We can decide on whether or not we want to get gifts at all for each other going forward, but I am informing you all that if I *ever* receive another joke gift from anyone, it will be immediately going into the garbage, and I will be leaving the gathering. I do not understand why my saying that you all hurt my feelings to a severe degree is being brushed off as my being \"too sensitive.\" I think we all know that is plainly nonsense, and you're only saying that because you don't have the emotional maturity or consideration to make a proper apology to me. This whole incident has shown me the sort of people my own family are, and it's quite sad, to be honest. You can debate this message amongst yourselves all you want and come up with your own narrative to justify your poor, inconsiderate behavior, but just know that going forward this sort of nonsense will *not* be tolerated by me.\"\n\nFrankly, there's nothing to argue, debate, or justify on their end. You do *not* need to spare their feelings. Develop whatever boundaries you want here *and stick to them.* This is the upside to being an adult.

One year my brother got a toilet seat cover. But taped to the cover was the picture of the stereo that he desperately wanted and was his actual gift.\n\nThe joke should be junk thing you don\u2019t want as a cover-up for the thing you really do want. Not the thing you want as a cover-up for a junk. That\u2019s just cruel.", "When my family does joke gifts, the box is the joke, but there's always a good present in there. We have a couple of boxes that don't get thrown out (a commodore 64 box, an original NES box, and a Wii box) and reused every year to wrap something in. When you unwrap one of those, you know you're unwrapping your big present. If it went to one of our boyfriends, it meant our family approved of them. My sister and I also have a Fergalicious boot box we pass back and forth, because we were huge kids incorporated fans back in the day.\n\nWhen my nephew was a toddler, and my sister was still in her nervous first time mom phase, I found a \"baby's first camp fire\" prank box. My sister's expression was priceless when she read the box. There were a few small age appropriate toys for my nephew to make the box the right weight, but the main present was a gift card for my sister and BIL's favorite non kid friendly restaurant and a gift certificate from their regular babysitter.", "I think it tells something about your family that you have NEEDED to learn to mask your feelings around them.\n\nSorry to tell you this but they are bullies and they have long ago made you their target.

As soon as it starts up, leave. \n\nI think you'll eventually end up leaving permanently. Because they will never admit what they are really doing. Which is abuse.", "OP I feel bad for you. Not one person has the decency to point out that you actually didn\u2019t get any real gifts. And instead your reaction which was justified and handled a lot better than most was seen as so wrong. Your family sucks and they did ruin your Christmas. Do not apologize. I would let them sit in this uncomfortableness and not talk to them for awhile", "Yikes, how often are they doing things that force you to mask your feelings?\n\nSeems like this Xmas is probably not a one off at all. I'm really sorry OP.\n\nDon't let them make you feel like you're antagonizing them by taking space for yourself. They're creating the problem and there is nothing wrong with choosing to step away from it.", "This confirms what a lot of people are saying.   If you're not allowed to be hurt by what they do,  but you must apologize for any hurt given to others,  you're not an equal,  you're a scapegoat.  Therapy - or at least a few good self- help books on family dynamics and trauma healing might do you some good in terms of understanding what's happening here.   \n\nI have dealt with a different kind of emotional abuse, but what it had in common was that with my parents,  it was never a good idea to be upset with them.  It's translated into a lifetime of issues speaking my mind that I'm only getting over in my 50s.  Being able to hold your emotions is a valuable skill,  but so is letting them out when you deserve to. You did fine here and deserve to be proud for sticking up for yourself.", "I connect to this so much. My family acts similarly when someone has an issue, is hurt, or just expressing themselves. They bully you, put you down, and try to minimize your feelings by making them seem over the top. That\u2019s not ok! You\u2019re allowed to feel upset about this openly and in the moment. They ALL were in on making you feel sad so y\u2019know what? They ALL should expect to experience your sadness and frustration. Making you the bad guy is such a bad show of character for all of them. You should keep expressing yourself even if it makes them uncomfortable, because if they become too uncomfortable, they might actually stop doing to things that make you feel that way! If they don\u2019t, you know to put distance and boundaries between them and you.\n\nI got hounded by both my parents for getting upset that I wouldn\u2019t get to sit with my fianc\u00e9 on a long return flight home after having that happen on the flight there. We had a miserable time traveling apart because any entertainment we had for the long flight was for both of us to enjoy together. Plus I get travel anxiety that really makes me feel upset.\n\nI told them I\u2019m allowed to be upset, I won\u2019t be deterred from expressing how I feel, and that if this is their reaction to something that is legitimately a problem for me (no matter how big or small) they know why I don\u2019t trust them or call them about bigger problems. Went outside to calm and collect myself and my fianc\u00e9 came out a bit later to help find better seats. \n\nRight after returning, my mom had an issue pop up at work that required her to have to work a half day on my last day there and she was openly upset. I word for word recited what she had just told me to do and she looked shocked, sad, and totally shut down. The instant realization hit her and my dad like a truck and I immediately said, \u201cSee, it doesn\u2019t feel good when someone minimizes your situation and your feelings. How you feel now is how I felt about the flight and your own words made you feel like this. We should give space to each other to feel bad because life\u2019s not just one perfect moment. I\u2019m actually really sorry you have to work tomorrow, so we will make sure to not plan anything in the morning so you don\u2019t feel left out. I\u2019ll even sleep in til noon so we don\u2019t miss a single moment together.\u201d\n\nI get that that\u2019s their generational trauma, to have their feelings minimized and made fun of, but that stops with me. Even your parents can\u2019t fight being real and honest with complaints and blame. There\u2019s no argument against your very real feelings of hurt. What they do with your hurt tells you how to react too. Distance and boundaries\u2026 make them cross that bridge or burn it down as their actions are their own choice.", "Yeah I would cut them off forever and just spend Christmas with your boyfriend\u2019s family. \n\nThe fact that they\u2019re calling YOU ungrateful when none of them got you ANYTHING for Christmas\u2026 like I would just lose it. I don\u2019t know how you weren\u2019t throwing things and then saying \u201cit\u2019s just a joke!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I be ungrateful if I received nothing for Christmas? Being ungrateful implies that I actually got something\u2026 which I did not.

You were told you were ungrateful because you got NOTHING from your family for Christmas. \n\nIf they don\u2019t understand, that\u2019s fine. Cut them off, too. You don\u2019t need that BS in your life.", "OK, so this is a pattern & it's really likely that they all did it on purpose.

And that crap about \"You just have to wait until NEXT CHRISTMAS for good gifts\" GTFO\n\nYou were 100O% justified in leaving and THEY ruined Christmas by deliberately being assholes and expecting you to just take it. Actually BUYING your book and then just casually giving it to an In Law??? BOTH your parents suck and they DESERVE to see that other people actually value you enough to treat you well. If they are embarrassed that they took it too far, then GOOD. If they care about you, they would have apologized when they realized it was Every. Single. Gift.

Unless you live in that home and are required to be around them, I would send them a group message that says until they fix the situation you\u2019re going low to no contact with them.

Every Christmas, I would get presents that I hated (chocolate) on mass and stuff they knew that I was allergic to. Got threats of not being grateful for everything. I'd sit and watch everyone get brand new consoles, games, and even holidays and washing machines. I would have to be grateful for stuff I'd give away and a single book I choose basically for myself. \n\nThey used to hide it under pranks and jokes with stuff but it just got worse.

Set out clear boundaries - this hurt your feelings getting no real gifts and expecting to just laugh along, especially when you have refused to take part in any pranks for so long. In future, if people give a joke gift, you'll leave. It's not a joke if the target is not happy.

It sounds as if you've spent the last couple years apart from them. You've seen how normal people act, including your boyfriends' family.

You never once told the world how horrible they were but the pictures of you getting something thoughtful set them off by saying you were awful.\n\nLook your family is the awful one here. If I were you I'd block them on your social media pages. You don't need them sending screenshots to the family to get angry at you when you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThere's no reason to apologize to them. You leaving wasn't because you were ungrateful.

Pretending its a joke or prank is nothing but an AH move.\n\nA prank would have been going through all of that and then having a really nice gift as the last gift. Like a real mac book or a big ticket item you really wanted. Not giving you the family's used gift cards, a book cover and the left over trash.\n\nWhat they did wasn't a prank. It was petty meanness. They should feel ashamed of themselves. Every one of them should feel ashamed of themselves.", "Your family is very mean.  They delighted in showing you how little they care about you.

I didn't do this because I was holding a grudge, I was truly afraid she would hurt me again and wanted to limit my exposure to her cruelty. We speak now.

But if she ever mistreat me again, all contact will cease forever, apology or not. We teach people how to treat us. What we put up with is what we'll get.

I ended up deciding I didn\u2019t want a bike anymore. Even though I couldn\u2019t articulate it properly as a child I knew something wasn\u2019t right about the set up for this deal.

Your mom and family kept telling you they were getting you real gifts only to get you fake ones; you told your family you\u2019d be visiting the whole holidays but that was just a gag gift - instead they get the prank gift of you leaving early *and you know how much they love gift fake outs*.", "She should have photos of what she bought herself with the money she saved. Mac book box with a photo of her using her new Mac book. Favourite book cover with a photo of herself reading the book at home. Fake tickets for a trip with a photo of herself on the beach. I bet her family will die laughing at all the great pranks,  I'm sure that they know how to take a \"joke\"", "Yeah, being called a \"prank\" gift is very generous here. \n\nA prank is a joke that should be intended to have everyone laughing at the end, *including* the 'victim' of the prank. Sometimes that goes wrong of course, but the intent should be there, and if it does go wrong, you apologize. \n\nIf it is just intended to make others laugh at the victim's expense, that's not a prank, that's just bullying. \n\nThis family had 6 siblings, but 5 of those 6 happened within an 8 year span, then there was relative stability before OP was probably an 'oops' baby. Sounds like she's been given poor treatment ever since for disrupting the prior dynamic.", "I have always been the \"sensitive\" one in my family, which led me to pushing all my emotions down and not showing how I really feel in family situations.  Even now that I'm in my 60s I'm expected to allow others to just do or say what they want.  This is especially true for my brother, because \"it's just how he is.\"\n\nWell, this is how I am - I'm not taking it any more.  My brother said some things about my partner that he can't take back, and I've gone LC with the family.  My mother came to talk to me about things, and asked why I was \"ruining Christmas\" and \"breaking up the family\" because I will no longer be in the same place as my brother.  Way to push it all back on me without holding him accountable. Ma.\n\nI keep remembering the quote from Homer Simpson: \"Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that, when daddy hit the referee?\"  Don't let it get to the point where you throw the whiskey bottle at the referee!\n\nPlease consider some therapy (if you haven't already) to help you handle the choices you make.  Your family has already tried to make you feel bad about your reactions to their bad actions without taking any responsibility for their actions, a therapist can help you realize you are NTA and that healthy families do NOT act like this.\n\nGood luck, and hugs from a random Internet dad.", "This is absolutely perfect.", "Given the way you appear to have been conditioned to under-react by your family, the best Christmas present you can get yourself is some therapy to unpick some of the emotional damage they have done to you.", "Don\u2019t buy them gifts, ever again. EVER AGAIN.", "I think it\u2019s pretty shitty that the other relatives got what they wanted in the end and you didn\u2019t. Your bf\u2019s family was kind enough to give you the book that you wanted, but your own family couldn\u2019t bother to gift it to you? Yeah, your family sucks OP. I would consider going NC with them because it seems like they don\u2019t really love you.", "They thought those gifts out though, at least the mom did. It was just they chose to be thoughtfully mean about it.  \nThe book would've broken me, but my most wanted gift WAS a book this year. Didn't get it but, eh, that's grown up life. However, being made to THINK someone had listened to me and got me something I was genuinely giddy for? That they'd bought it just to give me the slip cover? I'd have cried on the spot.  \n\nBeing completely forgotten would've been a kindness compared to what they did, damn. OP, unless you lit the tree on fire on your way out you're NTA, not at all. You handled it with a lot more dignity and grace than most would've.", "Yes! They were joke gifts but very mean-spirited in intention. Very pointedly specific to tricking OP to thinking they got her what she wished for but only to pull the rug from underneath her several times over.  It's wild the family thought this was acceptable behavior.", "I have an old and feeble family member playing apology chicken right now. They've lost most of their family over the incident, and are pouting to anyone who will listen about being excluded from things; which is quite a sob story until you hear that literally all they'd have to do is have a conversation with the wronged party. They were *so sure* everyone would come crawling back the moment they flexed their family standing, but that didn't end up happening and now it's been years. \n\nI really wish it wasn't the case, but it's looking more and more like they're just going to die estranged. It was a stupid conflict but they're choosing their pride over their family at the end of their life.", "Exactly, the others can be played off as \"we had the box so we thought it would be funny\", but with the book they specifically went out and bought it for the \"prank\" and gave away the book rather than let OP have it.", "Ultimate power move right there.", "Don\u2019t forget the real laptop was wrapped inside a fancy purse!", "\"Can't you take a joke\"/\"We were only joking\" is the classic (and huge) red flag of emotionally abusive bullies. And from OP's post, I get the sense that they've always done this.  It's beyond *showing* toxic signs; OP's family are full-on abusers, with OP as the family scapegoat.\n\nOP, what your family did was not funny. It was abusive as hell.   I suspect this has happened before, over and over. You're NTA, your family **are** full-on AHs, and you might consider getting therapy to help heal from damage, if that crap is how they've always engaged with you.", "I think this will backfire, because if they all get one joke gift (from OP) and their other gifts are thoughtful they can easily claim (and might even believe) getting a joke gift is not too bad.\n\nThe painful thing is OP got ONLY jokes and then gaslighted for trying to calmly explain she didn\u2019t feel joy for it.", "I would not have made it to supper. I would have already left.", "The worst part is that they all must have collaborated and planned this in order for all of them to do this at the same time. The odds of that happening naturally are about as likely as winning the lotto.", "Yeah the only way any of this makes sense would be if the very last gift was opened by OP and it was keys to a new car, tickets to a vacation, or a diamond ring with proposal by boyfriend followed by family all giving cash gifts to go toward the wedding, or something else big like that - so all the prior prank gifts would be (somewhat) funny in retrospect. \n\nI kept waiting for OP to add \"and then they explained they were upset because my real gift was \\*insert something wonderful here\\* and I left right before they were planning to give it to me.\" or something.\n\nA good prank gift is wrapping a small but good present in an increasingly larger series of boxes, or the gift being the first clue to a scavenger hunt ending with the good gift, or giving a \"funny\" gift alongside another real gift. \n\nWhat happened to OP was not funny, and pranks are only good if the person being pranked laughs in the end. \n\nWe never really did prank gifts, the extent we went to might have been multiple boxes within boxes, or a box with a note inside saying \"look out the back door for your gift\" (like a bike or something), or even a note saying \"your gift is on the way! Here's the tracking number!\" if something was running late. \n\nI did used to put jingle bells in each package I wrapped, though. So shaking them did nothing much to clue in what was in them... they all just jingled.", "lol my grandma told one of my uncles to propose to his gf by putting the ring box in a slightly bigger box and so on and so on like a russian doll of a dozen or so boxes, she would get frustrated and he'd say \"keep going\" til she eventually got the ring", "I remember one Christmas when everyone gave my grandpa bags of M&Ms. We also picked out other things for him, so at the end of the day, he had one big joint gift from all his kids, a bunch of little presents from grandkids, and about 20 lbs of chocolate. He didn't get nothing! He didn't just get cheap candy! I think he'd told someone they could just put his name on some M&Ms if they didn't know what to get him.", "Also gift him a ridiculously tiny hammer and chisel to chip away at the ice with.", "Jesus, I am so sorry that you grew up in such a cutthroat environment.  What an awful thing to do to your child.  But I am very glad that you found yourself a keeper and got away from that hideous woman.  <3"]}
