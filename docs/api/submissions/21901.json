Just my $.02 worth", "I'm not going to call you an AH for wanting to defend your friend, the bride...however, pouring wine on the future MIL is an extreme response to the situation and it will absolutely cause a scene that will totally distract from the wedding, and if that happens it might be worse than if you hadn't acted at all.\n\nFor this reason I will say YWBTA for being the match that lights the explosion.\n\nMy own mother did this me, she's a real life narcissist so it honestly didn't surprise or phase me.  I did learn recently, from her actually, that apparently she got a TON of shit for doing it from a lot of the guests, lmao!!  No wine was spilled though.  \n\nI say if she has the nerve to go through with this, just go up to her and ask, \"WTH, mil?? Why did you wear a white dress? Are you trying to upstage the bride?\" It's almost a guarantee if you do it, others will too. \n\nShame is a far more effective tool than wine...if she isn't, in fact, shameless.\n\nI found a great video of another bride this happened to.

I would inform everyone of the dress code anything bridal (white/cream/ivory/light pastels) will get you evicted from the wedding and make sure the bride AND groom agree to this.\n\nThis allows you to 1) have someone else do the annoying part of evicting the grooms mother. 2) makes the boundaries exceptionally clear 3) Makes sure your friend isn't marrying a mama's boy who will put his mother ahead of his spouse.", "YWBTA\n\nThis would be YOU exacerbating the situation by causing a scene. The groom needs to deal with his mom in advance of the wedding. This is something for the bride and groom to come to a consensus on together, NOT your problem to solve at the wedding.", "ESH. Obviously the MIL sucks. I know this is a thing people say they would do. But don't do it. It would be a dickish thing to do. And even if it feels justified, it's still dickish. You will cause a scene, and it'll make you look bad.\n\nI know you want to help your friend. But this is HER problem, not yours. And throwing red wine on her husband's mother is not going to fix anything.\n\nYour friend needs to sit down with her fiance and explain what the problems are. HE needs to handle his mother, not her and certainly not you. If he doesn't deal with it, honestly, she should reconsider marrying him. If he won't stand up for his wife to his mother now, he never will.

If she is being horrible on the day, you would be a hero for doing this!", "NTA but don't do this, it'll almost certainly backfire, MIL will cause a scene which will be much more distracting and memorable than the dress itself.

Help the bride by all means necessary\u2026seriously", "Yes, the monster in law is wrong for wearing white, but to deliberately throw wine on people wearing white? Why do people feel the need to sabotage weddings? I am completely gobsmacked at the fact you are considering it, AND planted to seed in her head. Yes, monster in law is acting like a child, BUT two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. There are other ways to get your point across, going about it like a petulant teenager is not the way.

Maybe the bride should put a last minute thing out telling EVERYONE to wear pure white and have a different coloured dress herself?

If he doesn't do anything,  she has a fianc\u00e9 problem,  not a MIL problem (although she might have it already). The wedding planner should be handling this, i.e. escorting the MIL out.", "Nta.

Every single toast or speech should have at least one or two mentions - maybe even a \u201cstand up MIL, so we can all see your bridal gown - turn around for us!\u201d\n\nPublic humiliation would be much more effective.", "NTA - but this isn\u2019t your job\u2026 the groom needs to get this taken care of NOW!

Yes.  Would I blame you? No.\n\nBUT. . . .

By the end of the ceremony she started to realise she messed up because of the shocked looks and comments she got from her own family. By the reception the veil had disappeared and she had borrowed someone\u2019s wrap to cover it a bit.\n\nGet a couple of charity shop dresses in about her size that would work for the photos and save the day by offering these out when she makes her mistake. \n\nShe will be the villain, but tipping red wine on her white dress will only make you the most memorable villain of the day.\n\nAt least you can say \u201cI even offered her a suitable emergency dress but she just wouldn\u2019t change\u201d and she can cope with not being included in photos.", "Pouring wine on her dress might get you stuck with a cleaning bill but I like it. You know what else is great? Chocolate. Chocolate is fantastic and if you are sneaky enough you could get that on her dress without her ever knowing and boom no bill. That is just my 2c. You are NTA but the groom sure is.", "Yes, it'd cause even more drama", "Someone on here bought a bright orange vest of shame, had the guests at the bridal shower \u2018decorate\u2019 it, and decreed that anyone breaking the no-white dress rule would be forced to wear it. It\u2019s more than fair warning, and anyone who wears white afterwards will constantly be asked why they aren\u2019t wearing the vest of shame at the wedding. If the bridal shower is over do it at the rehearsal- get EVERYONE in on the fun. \ud83d\ude09", "100%. This isn't just a MiL problem, it's a fiance problem.", "When someone cannot be ashamed of themselves, a good Old Fashioned Public Shaming is appropriate.  I heartily approve, I\u2019m an old lady and this is precisely how things were handled back in the day.", "nta", "NTA, but it might be worse than just ignoring her. What would be better is for every female friend of the bride to wear white, males too for that matter. She wants to stand out among the other guests out of spite, but she can't stand out if everyone else wears white. That would be petty and at no risk of legal trouble. She'll stand out either way, wearing white at a wedding that isn't hers or, the \"wine way\", which would lead to her making a scene and ruining the whole party.", "I've seen so many posts about relatives wearing white to weddings when not the bride. \n\nYou could try to find a sub where people have come up with other ways to halt this.\n\nHusband should be growing balls & dealing with his mother though!", "How about all women showing up in white and if possible their Wedding dress - except for the bride in a bright color dress? But the bigger problem is the husband, is he backing up his future wife or is he a mama boy and Future ex?", "I'm curious - have you some better? Not maliciously asking, just thinking- what could they do?   \nEdit: Yes, they can hire security guards and don't let anyone dressed like a bride come in."]}
