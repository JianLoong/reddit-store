About 7 years ago he and his then fiance planned a destination wedding in a place that was convenient for them and most guests. For me, it was an overnight flight. Brother and SIL paid for accommodation and food. I paid for my flight, which was a lot because my business was just getting off the ground then.\n\nWe stayed in the wedding venue. Everyone was given a luxurious room except me and the bride's cousins, all teen girls - we got camp beds in an attic, so a dorm situation (my BF now hubby didn't come for various reasons). \n\nThere were a few other things that happened that made me a bit uncomfortable.\n\nFor example. My mother had volunteered us to help with some things, and there was an undertone of annoyance that we weren't working hard enough or doing things 'right'.\n\nI made an joke to my SIL about feeling out of place, meaning because I was the only woman not in a couple. She decided I was uncomfortable because I wasn't as thin as her friends, and reassured me that another friend who was coming later was also plus size. (I'm not plus size.) \n\nThis is just to give a sense that while this was an objectively stunning event and everyone else was thrilled, I personally didn't enjoy it very much, and felt like I was there for duty. It wasn't some memorable experience, it was a stressful and emotionally demanding family wedding.\n\nI had had a brief chat with my brother beforehand asking what they wanted as a gift, and he said oh don't worry you're making all the effort to come, we don't expect one. I did not speak to my SIL about this at all and didn't think much about it. \n\nFast forward a few months and I'm visiting their state with some family. We go out for lunch and brother picks up the tab - FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT ME. He pays 90% of the bill and then says to me 'oh ChemicalAnxiety you owe $32'. I was flustered and embarrassed and quickly got my wallet out then left. Everyone else looked confused except bro and SIL who were stony faced. \n\nI asked my mom about it and she said that bro and SIL have been annoyed with me since the wedding because I didn't bring a gift, and even if I was broke I should have got a token something. They were so irritated that they decided to never pay for anything for me ever again since I am ungrateful that they gave a wonderful time at the wedding of the decade. \n\nI was floored by this and it's impacted on my relationship with my brother. I was furious that he didn't just talk to me about it.\n\nHowever! I was discussing it recently with a friend and she said that I absolutely was at fault and was TA, you never go to a wedding without a gift, it's a huge breach of etiquette even if the groom has casually said it's not needed.\n\nWhat do the sages of Reddit think?", "created_utc": 1699219160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17om07z/aita_for_not_giving_my_brother_a_wedding_present/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is though, you ask he says don\u2019t worry about it then pulls that shit! Clearly he had a chat with SIL who was pissed and never told her about your conversation about it. He then also never brings it up with you. Destination weddings are so expensive absolutely not unreasonable to not give a gift.", "NTA. You offered and he declined. Then he humiliated you in public. What an utter pig.", "NTA - To say one thing and then to expect something else is a recipe for drama and disaster. If they expected a gift, they could've said they want xyz or expect you to pick something for them.", "Nta.  You\u2019re his sister for gods sake. He knew money was tight. He told you not to worry about a gift since he clearly understood you were shelling out bucks for the flight.  Since you were trying to get your business off the ground, I\u2019m assuming you were well past teenage girl age. Did he bother to have a conversation about where you\u2019d be sleeping?  You just got tucked in with the teens in a dormer.  You were volunteered for wedding duties or miscellaneous and probably not thanked.  \n\nWas your brother this petty before or has he really just no clue.  I would write a private letter to your brother.  Remind him of his comment about the gift and your efforts. Let him know how hurt you feel by his treatment, especially when he never even took the time as your brother to have a conversation with you if he was so upset or felt so wronged. I think theres some big miscommunication or even misdirection here.   Get that off your chest and then leave it alone. Don\u2019t send anything to house or mutual email. Use his private one.", "NTA - that\u2019s some petty ass behavior and your parents are complicit.", "NTA.  Your brother specifically told you to not worry about it because you made the effort to be there. Sounds like your SIL convinced him they were slighted.

Yes weddings are expensive if you make a big affair of it. Is that a necessity to get married legally? Nope. It's a choice. You choose to spend a lot of money on one day. Don't expect others to do the same, it's not their big day.

It\u2019s crazy they condone your brother\u2019s terrible behavior.", "NTA\n\nFirstly,  you asked. People really need to start saying what they mean.\n\nSecondly,  how old were you? Because if you paid for your own flight, were just starting your own business, you obviously were not all that young. To stick you in a dorm situation was a bit rude.\n\nYou said your BF now husband. Were they invited to your wedding? Sounds like if they were they wouldn't  have bothered to get you anything.  Did thay happen?\n\nWeddings seem to cause so many issues. People need to stop focusing on presents or money and get back to it being about love and sharing that with people who mean something.\n\nMy neighbours are currently all at war over a wedding and it's fricken ridiculous.  The bride is a nutcase and isn't  talking to me because I won't  pick a side and stayed neutral in the eruption. \nSo glad I didn't  go (no kids allowed and I couldn't get anyone to watch mine), was an absolute shit show by the sounds of it!\n\nI say talk to your brother and point out that he said not to bring anything. If he wanted something he should have said. But now he is being immature and passive aggressive. He is TA and so is your SIL.\n\nGood luck.", "nta - your brother told you not to worry.  so he changed his mind & did not tell you.", "NTA\n\nRidiculous.\n\nYour gift was your expenses, and your service.\n\nHe's being very petty.\n\nI think you might consider buying him a wedding card now and telling him what your gifts were.", "NTA because you were broke, had a conversation about it and still showed up to help out.\n\nYour bro on the other hand deserves some sort of award for petty prick of the year. Who the fuck pays for everyome except their own sister and makes a massive public display of it. I'm sorry you had to suffer the embarrassment of that situation.\n\nWhen I finally get married my invites will say something along the line of the only presents we need is your presence or something. Sure if people want to gift I'm not gonna object but it isn't expeted or needed.", "This is one of my pet peeves.

Say what tf you want!!", "Does anyone in the family know about this conversation or are you being the bigger person to not cause drama and keep quiet?  Because I wouldn\u2019t. I would say, I\u2019m sorry, I thought our conversation about what you wanted for wedding gifts, then being told not to worry about it, was real.  Obviously you lied, then chose to use it against me the rest of my life.  Then I\u2019d leave and have no contact with such despicable people. If you choose to keep quiet, then why complain. Let others know. You asked. You took to heart he meant it because you thought he cared about your circumstances.  Then let them look like the AH they are.", "NTA, and your brother is so petty! It\u2019s 7 years ago and NOW is the time he chose to react. Tell your SIL about the conversation you and your brother had. \n\nI would personally just gift them something with a card saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry the gift is late, hopefully we can regain a good sibling relationship again. Please tell me if you have any problems, don\u2019t wait 7 years next time! \u201d. Just to get the drama away from you.\n\nThese type of people will always try to find a way to passive aggressive way to deal with their feelings instead of communicating them. And even though it sucks, it\u2019s better to just buy them a gift now and get on with it.", "ESH.\n\nOk you asked and he said not to get anything but you should have got a silly little thing at least, just something as a token. On the other hand, the way they treated the groom's sister is way below the minimum you should expect, so they've already had their petty revenge before the present issue ever happened.", "Write to your say you thought you didn\u2019t have to bring a gift as you and he had discussed this \nHim been petty is sad\nBut you should of at least taken a card  small gesture", "ESH- next time, you take a cheese board or similar. No one can say you didn\u2019t give a gift and it\u2019s far enough off center that there isn\u2019t a public price tag that can be applied to it.", "You should have brought a gift. You were not a good guest, but your brother was acting like a childish asshole.", "So I think when your brother said don\u2019t get me a gift, they meant like a money gift. But I think a card or a little something would have been a nice gesture. \n\n\nBefore I ever got married and planned a wedding, I went to one when I was like 21 and the couple getting married was SOOOOO rich. Like country club, Range Rover rich. I was waitressing and barely paying my bills in college. \n\nSo I didn\u2019t bring a gift and it\u2019s something I always felt weird about\u2026 and then when I got married\u2026 it happened to me and it\u2019s the most annoying insulting thing. \n\nBest practice is to always give a gift.", "I am going to get down voted again....but you cannot go to a wedding and not give a gift", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep giving their kids presents but I suspect there will come a time where they might pick up on their parents values and you'll have some decisions to make!", "NTA - If you want a destination wedding, coming to the wedding is the gift and you have to understand people have different financial situations. Your brother and your SIL are AH amd your friend is wrong. At my wedding we didn't expect out of town guests to pay any gifts. The SIL in particular sounds entitled.", "Nta he told you not to. You should mention that to him.", "NTA bc you asked but let me just say to take this as a lesson to always bring at least a card.", "OMG. NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! They are so very wrong. You sacrificed and were put to work. You went above and beyond by asking. \n\nI always recommend writing a letter. You can put down the chain of events. What was said, and how you felt.  Only if this is something you want to do. \n\nYour brother is completely at fault. And it appears that your sister-in-law needs to truly look in the mirror and do some hardcore therapy. Your brother told you the gift was you putting in the effort at their wedding. And the way they treated you at dinner was shameful. If I were in your shoes, I would write the letter. They may have a moment of reflection. They may become even angrier. Or dismiss it because they feel that they are so so right. However, it would give you the opportunity to move forward in your relationship with whatever is most suitable for you. \n\nYou do not need to make an effort for anyone that treats you this way. They are supposed to be family. They are supposed to be safe people. And they are your bullies. You did NOTHING WRONG.\n\nIf you do send a letter. Make sure to take photos of it so it\u2019s time stamped and they don\u2019t try to make it into something different than how you sent it. What kind of man treats his sister this way? And allows his wife to not only treat you this way, but become a part of it.", "NTA and actually a wedding gift can be given up to a year after the ceremony and be acceptable according to proper etiquette.", "NTA. You asked your brother about a gift. He said don\u2019t worry about it. That 100% takes you off the hook. \n\nNext time you go out to a restaurant with him, make sure to ask for a separate check before ordering.  It will take the fun away from them.", "ESH.  Seriously, a grand destination wedding and you bring nothing?  What's next?  Your nephew/niece birthday where you feel uncomfortable so no present even though you eat the food and cake?  And your only excuse is \"I asked but he said don't worry about it?\" I bet if you could do it over again, you would have brought something which is the best evidence of YTA.\n\nBut your bro is a total AH.  Being petty without talking to you is totally passive aggressive BS.  \n\nI hope you can have a real conversation with your brother and SIL.  Take some accountability with an apology and hopefully your relationship can be mended.", "NTA. But your brother is. Geez. Seriously? Who takes the whole family out and pays for everyone except one? No matter if you brought a gift or not.", "NTA", "NTA. He told you not to bring a gift then acts like a petty AH when you didn\u2019t bring one? Who is this guy?", "NTA. Your brother knows that he told you a gift was unnecessary because he knew the wedding would be a bit of a financial hardship for you. It was then a really shitty trick to pull to pay for everyone's meal but yours and publicly humiliate you. \n\nYour SIL was nasty to imply that you were uncomfortable due to being a plus size. She sounds like a real piece of work. \n\nThen, to make matters worse, instead of being allowed to enjoy the wedding and the exotic location, you were conscripted to work. And now they expect you to be grateful for the opportunity to pay a small fortune that you couldn't afford to be humiliated and to work, even though you were a guest. \n\nI would have a really hard time getting over this. I would never feel the same about my brother and I would certainly have no warm feelings for my new SIL.", "Nta and to hell with your obnoxious brother.", "I agree with your friend. YTA, should have got them a little something.", "\u201cThe wedding of the decade\u201d. Lmao, what bold narcissists.\n\nNTA. Your brother doesn\u2019t care about you.", "He said don't. If he didn't mean it, he shouldn't have said it. The fact that he decided to single you out at a meal says he wants to hurt you and embarrass you. I would personally take a step back and not spend much time with them. NTA", "NTA, and your brother should have told you he had a problem instead of deciding to embarrass you in front of everyone, apparently at every single occasion for the entire rest of your life without ever once telling you why.  What a ridiculously immature thing to do.  He and his wife should be ashamed of themselves.", "How do siblings behave like this? I was too young to be earning when my elder brother got married so I showed up, helped out and celebrated them. They didn\u2019t even expect a gift from me. Cut to half a decade later when i got married, they insisted on giving me a gift, despite my saying no and the fact that they couldn\u2019t even make it to the wedding due to the pandemic. Ultimately, they sent money to my parents for transferring into my account just so I have something from my brother and SIL and can probably use it on a rainy day. No expectations, just pure love. I shower my nephew and niece with love and gifts and that\u2019s enough my brother and SIL to be happy.\nYou\u2019re NTA", "Theres a simple solution, either quit going out with your family or very pointedly ask the waitress to put yours on a separate bill every time removing his ability to put you on the spot.  If anyone asks simply tell them you don't want to be in debt to your brother.  Puts it back on him without direct confrontation.", "Sounds like bro threw OP under the bus here!\n\nSIL sounds like a huge brat, these people are deplorable and obnoxious.. to leave OP to pay her own bill like that is extremely rude! I'd avoid them or even go NC if I were in your situation here.", "Or an engaged toaster", "Good point.  Why didn't your mother or another sibling promptly offer to pay for you?", "Wahahahahaha this is excellent thank you so much", "Yep my parents and some other relatives know allllll about this, everyone else is more or less on the same page that bro and SIL are Difficult", "My SIL is the genius queen of passive aggressive pettiness. These days I'm more impressed than annoyed, for example she managed to find a way to be superior and judgemental about me using reusable not disposable diapers! You have to admire that. I don't really take it personally because she's like this with a lot of peeps.", "Ooooohhh you are sneaky", "This! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "Well I don't know hey. According to most replies on this post (and Miss Manners, apparently!) it's not appropriate to expect a gift for a destination wedding where the guests have spent a large amount of money to get there. And in this case I was helping out as well, so wouldn't broke me getting all the way there and doing lots of prep work be equivalent to a gift? Esp since broke me got shoved in a dorm with all the kids?", "This.  And do it EVERY SINGLE TIME.  EVERY SINGLE TIME you will pull out your wallet and explain in a clear, carrying voice that when you were a teenager at your brother's wedding he told you a gift wasn't necessary because you had flown all the way there, but in fact he and his wife never forgave you for not bringing a gift, and decided without telling you why that they would never again pay for anything for you in his entire life, and embarrass you by doing this in public, so you're paying for your own lunch, plus tip, please give you a separate bill. Then smile brilliantly at your petty brother and his horrible wife.  Do this EVERY SINGLE TIME.  You probably won't see much of them, though. Wow, what nasty, petty people.", "You can feel sorry for your brother that he's married to such a horrible woman, if that makes you feel better.  I'm glad you don't have to see much of them.", "I know you don\u2019t seem to mind the mistreatment but\u2026there\u2019s a huge difference between family that can be difficult at times and then family who\u2019s just damn toxic. Your brother must like being a doormat, too, if SIL is the one who calls all the shots. They both sound like rotten soulless people if you ask me. \n\nBut you\u2019re apparently ok with being treated like dirt on the bottom of their shoe so I guess this is all a moot point. If you\u2019re not willing to stand up for yourself and respect yourself then, no. You don\u2019t get to be \u201caggrieved\u201d regarding the situation. You\u2019ve made it clear to them you\u2019re ok with it. So why be aggravated?", "She sounds insufferable.", "Start rejecting their gifts with character. Tell them no thanks. We would rather not get anything at all. If you\u2019re going to give me something used or broken and claim we like character then don\u2019t even worry about it. Say it loud enough so everyone can hear so they can feel shitty.", "As someone who owns several Miss Manners books, I can tell you that a gift should NEVER be expected. Some people treat parties and events as a pay-to-play. That's not how it should be. You may not have caught her end comment, which was this: presents are optional.\n\nThey should be acting as good hosts who have invited their loved ones to share in their celebration. Is it nice to give a gift. Absolutely. Required? Never. Miss Manners wasn't even onboard with registries.\n\nIt grieves me to think of all the unnecessary wedding drama generated these days because families treat their guests like pinatas instead of people. It sounds like you really love your brother and his kids. It does not sounds like he loves you very much. The gall to publicly shame you for $32 and all the other slight you've put up with all these years...I truly hope it's worth it for you, because it sounds like he's done nothing to earn it.", "Very true. I would never make that kind of effort - just avoid them.", "You are NTA. They really need to get over it after all these years. It\u2019s just ridiculous at this point", "Actually, I am getting the door mat vibes too.", "She is... quite something. But they adore each other, and bro is happy. It just upsets me a bit that their kiddos will probably adopt mom's attitude at some stage.", "Ah okay so since I'm not going for the thermonuclear option over something that happened years ago in a relationship that does not impact on my daily life at all, I am a doormat? Your everyday interactions must be fun, with that powerful sense of perspective.", "So, why are you here asking for our opinions? You seem to be willing to take abuse from him because what he's doing is mildly abusive.", "The implication that having a discussion with him is blowing up a relationship is problematic. It means he can transgress and you have to eat it. \n\nStriving for balance isn\u2019t blowing a family relationship it is restoring it.", "Your brother blew up your family relationship already.", "Well I think you should get them a gift now and loudly proclaim that you\u2019re finally giving them a gift since they\u2019re still upset that you listened to brother when he said no need. Tell them you thought he was serious when he said that but their past actions have shown that he didn\u2019t actually mean it and so now you would like to present them with a wedding gift as an apology so they can quit with the pettiness and hope that they will let bygones be bygones. Make sure it\u2019s an announcement so everyone can know you\u2019re sincere.", "Then why are you asking on Reddit now?", "Right? Why be aggravated when you\u2019ve given them the green light to treat you like shit?", "I'm asking for opinions on whether I was an asshole for not giving them a wedding gift, not on whether I should remove them from my life, and/or whether my brother being a shit over his wedding classifies him as abusive. If you spend any time on this sub you know that loads of people act like total entitled assholes when it comes to their weddings. Doesn't mean they should all be expelled from our lives. Seriously some AITA commenters really need to get offline and take a walk.", "Asking about whether one is morally wrong in a  specific situation is different than asking to be called names."]}
