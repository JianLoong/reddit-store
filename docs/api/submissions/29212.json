I am an only child and my husband and I did a lot of heavy lifting to help him through everything while she was in the hospital, funeral planning and helping him sort through all her financial paperwork. In the end my mom did list my father and I as 50/50 beneficiaries for her 401k, which wasnt a lot but its enough to go on a nice vacation or do nice upgrade to something in our house. My dad will receive 100% of the life insurance along with the money from selling her car and the other half of the 401k, in total more than enough to cover all the costs of the funeral, medical bills and miscellaneous debt she had, he also still works and makes a decent living and will be fine affording the mortgage and all the bills on his own regardless of the extra payouts. The problem starts when yesterday at dinner he mentioned that he wants to hire a lawyer to plan his estate to make sure that when he passes away I don't have to go through the same trouble we did to get his assets and I said that was a great idea but then added saying he would be willing to split the cost of the lawyers fee with me ($500 each) from the money were getting from the 401k and I was shocked, he said it more as a statement and not a question so the conversation kind of just went on without me agreeing or disagreeing. My mom and dad's parenting style had always been more about what is \"fair for both parties\" and not necessarily what is just \"best for their child\" and I know the way he's thinking of it is that it's still a good \"deal\" for me since I will be his only beneficiary.  After being with my husband for 6 years and seeing his relationship with his parents, I know this is not something they would ever ask of us to help out with. Hopefully it's clear that the issue here isn't about being able to afford the $500 split and is if what I'm being asked of by my dad is appropriate. So am I a spoiled asshole if I tell my dad I don't think it's fair if him to ask me to pay for his estate planning?", "created_utc": 1697663424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b1h6p/aita_if_i_tell_my_dad_im_not_willing_to_pay_for/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is being cheap to want you to pay to help him sort out how he gives you his inheritance.", "$500 in now for 100% later?  If his home is worth anything you won\u2019t be on the losing end of the deal.  500 dollars is a small price to pay someone that lives by the \u201cwhat is fair\u201d rule when you will be the only heir.  Also $500 isn\u2019t too much to keep the peace.  Sometimes it is cheaper to give away some money rather than paying more in the long run to make something go away.", "NTA\n\nNot common, not yours to pay. Estate planning is a gift you leave those who survive you and some peace of mind that your wishes are upheld. It's not something for which you bill your descendants.\n\nHe should check his work benefits. We get free estate planning as part of my husband's job.", "NTA\n\nIt's his estate that needs planning, not yours.

I doubt any of my siblings would care either.", "Not a spoiled asshole at all, ngl it\u2019s kinda weird. Being honest, if my dad asked that I would just be very confused. \nLike, why? What is the point? It seems like something he should definitely pay for himself. It\u2019s his, it\u2019s not your responsibility to sort out his paperwork etc \nIt\u2019s even more strange, as you said your dad is comfortable enough to not need to worry about money. So, again the question is why?", "NTA, I\u2019m not sure if this is common practice but getting things sorted out before he passes is a responsibility that (in my opinion) everyone has to go through.", "Listen, I think you misunderstand how money should be divvied up after someone dies. I have been an executor before (although I have never had to deal with a 401k, so forgive me if you experience varies). But it's my understanding that before doling out cash to beneficiaries, the estate first has to settle any debt. You seem to think that \"Mom left my dad an insurance policy. She also left a 401K to the two of us. So I took my half of the 401k. My dad is responsible for all the medical bills out of his end.\" No. I don't think this is how it works. I think the estate is responsible for the medical expenses and other debts, THEN the remaining funds get divided among beneficiaries. \n\nNTA, but consider this. Do you want to go through this hassle again after your dad dies?", "NTA. I can see his logic - it will, most likely, be helping *you* in the long run. But that\u2019s still just not a thing people do.", "NTA you could tell him that you are also going to do your estate planning , and he\u2019s a potential beneficiary, so it\u2019s easier if you both pay your own fees", "NTA - why would a parent ask their kids to pay for their estate planning? My will and such was done just when I had my second kid and I was late to the party. Dying isn\u2019t only for the older population, you never know what might happen?", "INFO:  Out of all the money between the 401(k), life insurance, and sale of the car, how much of a dent would $1k be?  Is the dent worth making this a hill to die on considering it is something that should be done?", "NTA. I know where my mother's will is. I know the expectation for how the funeral will be paid for. I know her intentions for the house if she still owns it when she dies. I know these things because she planned them then told me. She would *never* have asked me to contribute to the cost of planning *her* estate.\n\nHonestly? If your dad is fit and healthy then there is every chance that his financial circumstances will change between now and his death. Is he going to expect you to shell out money every time he has to update something? It's not hard to write a will, you can find guides online. If you're the only beneficiary then \"I leave everything to my daughter\" is not a complicated will. And if he's going to make you pay to update everything? It's probably easier (or, at least, cheaper) just to deal with it as it comes.\n\nYou probably have some idea of your dad's estate because you would have found out some of it dealing with your mom's. Just say, \"It would be helpful and responsible if you would take care of your own matters. If you won't take care of it yourself, I guess I'll just have to deal with all of this again later. It's up to you, but I won't be paying for your financial or legal advice.\"", "Man your mom died and you blowing a gasket to your dad over 500$ because it eats away at your nice little vacation ? \n\nYou indeed sport your father blood.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To me it seems a small enough thing to pay if your dad is not quibbling about having to pay so much of her debt and and end of life expenses out of his share of her estate that possibly should have been covered by her estate *before* you got your share. Or maybe the 401k is exempt.", "I would keep quiet and pay, but I would be bitter about it.

It\u2019s an inappropriate request BUT $500 now may be worth it for later if it is smooth everything out with very little time spent for you.

I'd ask him if he thought it would be fair for him to split the estate planning costs for you and your husband as well. After all, accidents happen all the time and he could outlive you.\n\nEstate planning is very personal on several levels. Just because you're an only child doesn't mean he shouldn't do it or that he shouldn't pay for it 100% out of his own pocket.", "It\u2019s likely to cost several thousand to create an effective probate plan.

That is his responsibility.  Maybe you all get your wills done and split that but if it\u2019s just his estate it\u2019s his cost.\n\nOther option is he can look at estate services through a trust group where they handle everything after passing and take money from estate (but he needs to have enough in the estate to cover). \n\nIt\u2019s like him asking you to pay his life insurance premium", "NTA but your father\u2019s eccentricity in asking is a definite red flag that would make me want to pay the $500 to make sure I had some input in his estate planning. Insist on attending the meeting so the estate planner knows what\u2019s going on, and insist on clear and simple instructions in the will so everything is laid out after he passes. This is such a weird request I would worry what would happen if you refuse to go along with his scheme and it\u2019s not worth giving up the inheritance for $500.", "That\u2019s pretty on par for a will and POA forms, also depends on how extensive the will is and geographic area.

What your dad can do, however, once he retires is to bleed out the IRAs and 401Ks so when he passes any assets are given to you without taxation.\n\nIRAs and 401Ks are for the middle class - and why Congress punishes survivors of people for actually using these savings accounts is beyond comprehension.", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re his only kid then I\u2019m not sure what mess you\u2019re avoiding by doing estate planning.

Your dad is doing you a HUGE favor. What does he gain by planning his estate? Nothing. He\u2019ll be beyond the cares of the mortal world after he passes. But you stand to gain everything.
