Divorce is hard on everyone.", "YBTA. While your mother is being dramatic, so are you. You say that her not attending your college graduation is going \"to jeopardize the very meaning of my college graduation.\" These ceremonies are really not that important in the long run. You didn't go to college in order to have a family reunion. You went to college to get a degree. The party is really not a big deal. A good solution would be to skip the pomp and cicumstance and go out to celebrate with each side of your family seperately. You could just go out to dinner. My parents don't get along and that's what I did and it saved me a lot of headaches. Similarly, rather than having a big wedding, you could just elope and then follow up with seperate celebrations with each parent. Weddings are expensive. Why not just go on a cool honeymoon instead? and then afterward follow up with celebrations with each side of your family. If folks hate each other then forcing them to get together to try and \"have fun\" in order to force some kind picturebook fantasy is just a waste of time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they are in the thick of a bad divorce it'll probably be easier for you to not have to have everyone at one table for a meal.
