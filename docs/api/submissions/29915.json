Sounds like you're in a culture in which men are easily threatened and made to feel insecure by accomplished women. Instead of admitting that THEY feel stupid, they try to blame you for \"causing\" them to feel whatever they feel. Find a better class of people to hang out with, OP, and don't look back. (of course they'll say you think you're better than them, and they'd be right)", "NTA.  If someone needs you to be less than you are for them to accept you, it is not a healthy relationship (friend or romantic).  As long as you are not being arrogant and dismissive of the other person, adding knowledge to a conversation is something most people can appreciate.  Seems like your boyfriend is blaming his insecurities on you.  If gets upset over losing a game of checkers, that's pretty childish.  Find a partner who loves you for all your accomplishments and makes you feel safe and secure being yourself.", "NTA your bf sounds like an insecure, poor loser and I don't even know him but I am 100% sure  that you can and will do better than him in this lifetime. Tell him to grow up or get lost.", "NTA. He sounds insecure. \n\nBut also: You should not hide your knowledge and intelligence, but you can work on how you present sometimes (did that myself). Like f.e.: Using a lot of loanwords \"to show off\", whereas you are able to further describe or simply use different language.", "NTA. He's insecure and is scared of you appearing smarter than he is (because you are). \n\nYou definitely crossed a line by \\*gasp\\* answering a question *correctly* and then you \\*shudder\\* told him he made a mistake in a game of...checkers!! /s\n\nSeriously, some people just can't admit that somebody might be better than them at something...or many things, in this case.", "NTA. You should break up with him.", "NTA, He's insecure. Sadly a lot of men feel threatened and intimidated by women who are smart, even if they manage to hide it most of the time. For it to break out like this, it might have been resentment that's been festering for a while, so it might be worth talking to him about how he feels, and how it makes him feel. \n\nTHIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. As someone who is also pretty smart, I know you're not doing it to show off, knowing that stuff is just a part of who you are and you shouldn't have to pretend around those you love. But I think you need to get to the root of just how deep this resentment goes, and what the root cause of it is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might be intellectually incompatible. On your side it isn\u2019t an issue, but on his side it is. It might also be a deal breaker for him, which is why he keeps making a big deal out of it.

I am a lawyer and my fianc\u00e9e never went to college. In my country you can stay in high school for 1-2 years after gcse to become a technician of a variety of fields. My fianc\u00e9e chose that and now he's a construction foreman directing and managing constructions. I am smarter than him according to me, according to him, according to anybody who knows us. That being said he has other strengths that I lack of. We are actually happy that we are good at other things so that we as a team are good regarding more fields. He always supported me and my studies, had my back throughout uni which was pretty hard for me because I also worked my ass off to have money.\n\nIf he really loved you he wouldn't act like a toddler. He's jealous."]}
