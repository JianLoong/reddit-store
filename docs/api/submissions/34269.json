I understand why but it always results in my having to double recipes or I run out of food. So this time I told everyone that I want to just do a girls night. This means my friends husband is not invited. If he isn\u2019t there that their is enough food for everyone without double recipes\n\nShe called me up asking why I am doing a girls night, I told her the truth that I can\u2019t afford to make double for dinner and her husband eats a lot. She called me a jag off and now she is telling my friends why. Everyone is split and no one is offering to help with the food bill.\n\nEdit: I will give the group the option to Venmo me some money or change it to a potluck.

It's weird to me that she questioned it being a girls night. That seems self-explanatory and sometimes you don't want to do couples' things. \n\nMaybe you were blunt in how you handled it, I'm not sure, but she was way ruder to not acknowledge what you're saying and calling you names. \n\nMy husband's best friend eats a ton and would totally clear us out at potlucks (while not bringing anything to contribute), so I told my husband to either talk to him about manners or stop inviting him. \n\nPeople like this are super rude expecting everyone else to accommodate them. Also, firefighters should know how to cook since they spend time at firehouses. Dude should be bringing a giant dish to share.", "NTA. \n\n1) people saying you should have just lied.

How about we all chip in or bring something to help\"? It's not to get indignant and try and cause trouble within the group. \n\nYou did nothing wrong arranging a smaller party to manage costs. Your friend just sounds entitled and ridiculous.", "INFO:\n\nIf one of the guests is eating more than you consider affordable, why didn't you dish up the meal (or at least, more expensive portions thereof) onto the plates before it gets to the dinner table, rather than serving everything family-style?

No reason to go through your money if no one backs you up or offers to help remedy the situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friend is the ahole though, she knows her husband eats a lot (per his own admission) but yet does nothing to help even it out for others. Get rid of that extra wieght (no pun intended)", "My husband can be a huge eater.

My husband has three nephews, who act like they\u2019ve never been fed at every family gathering. They shove their way in front of everyone once the food is all out, and after they have gone through, it looks like a swarm of locusts has decimated every dish.\n\nAfter a few of those incidents, I quietly went around to the moms with small kids, letting them know the food was ready so that they could make plates for their little ones first. Then I would go to the older people and let them know to go get their food. \n\nThis worked really well and insured that everyone had a fair shot of getting a little bit of everything.  Every once in a while, the boys would realize that people were getting in line and I would stop them and let them know that we were going in groups and that their turn was coming up soon and I would let them know.  \n\nThese were not young kids either and far too old to not be aware of how selfish/gluttonous their behavior was.  \n\nIt might\u2019ve been rude to say why the firefighter wasn\u2019t invited, as she could\u2019ve just stuck with the girls night reasoning.

He's also complaining that there's not enough food while eating it all. \n\nSome commenters are bending over backwards trying to make it your fault. Blaming people for starting with reasonable plates and you for not plating correctly is putting the onus on you to manage one person specifically on top of cooking and hosting. \n\nIf one person is eating so much that people are ordering take out at a dinner, he needs to start chipping in on the cost.", "INFO\n\n> I run out of food.\n\nWhy is this a problem, though?\n\nEveryone gets their plate.

Or ask everyone to bring a dish? Then you have to pay for less yourself and they can double up their own recipe\nYTA and should probably have just told the group it\u2019s getting expensive and you are happy to host but bringing dishes/contributing to the cost would help instead of singling out one person and making them feel guilty for eating but i understand times are tough and money is tight for everyone so it can be really difficult so i do feel for you in that sense.", "[deleted]", "NTA. OP says he eats 3 servings of stuff. That\u2019s rude ass behavior. I wouldn\u2019t invite him over either.", "NTA. You offered an event. Someone else said you weren't doing enough...\n\nSince when do guests get to tell a host they have to invite all the guests family and friends? Telling a host they're a \"jag off\" is out of line, that's when people get disinvited. \n\nLook, if I host an event, I typically choose the food and the guest list. My reasons for choosing are my own. You shouldn't have to invite someone because a guest wants to bring a friend/spouse.", "Nta.

You gave the truth (perhaps bluntly, but also...the reality so I get it) and people don't like the compromise options of split the bill or turn it into a potluck. Why are you expected to foot the bill in this situation? Why have you continually footed the bill?\n\nFor perspective - I am one of two people who often host in my main group of friends. When I was younger and less financially stable we were more likely to do potluck style overall and BYOB. Now we still lean towards BYOB on occasion, but I've made it clear to my friends that I will cover most things at my house unless otherwise stated - including alcohol. (Some still have their own preferences so they bring what they want and it gets left here if they don't finish it.) My friends still never show up empty handed generally. They offer to bring an appetizer or a dessert. Or even just bring a hostess gift. The only exception tends to be the other person who tends to also host because it's a bit of an unspoken agreement between the two of us in terms of how we have alternated hosting over the years.", "I honestly can not believe the number of people who have told her she was the A H for telling her friend the truth. I'm going to get downvoted to hell going against the Reddit mindset here, but seriously, this is a recurring event. She hosts often. She enjoys it. Sure, she could lie or omit information now, and avoid the current drama, and then the next function it will be the same. Now she has to lie multiple times, and mayne the friend imagines much worse reasons for the exclusion of the husband.\n\nDid her comment sting? Probably. Should real friends be scared to be honest with each other? I'd hope not. \n\nBy being honest, maybe I don't know, something may CHANGE???  Maybe he'll be more mindful when invited? Maybe her friend will offer to chip in? \n\nDoubling a recipe for one guest is stupid. He lacks manners or self awareness. I'd be embarassed if my husband acted this way and it caused drama (which from comments, it has...).\n\nNTA.", "NTA. What kind of friends don't offer to pitch in money or bring a dish themselves, or offer to host in exchange like a rotating cycle? Also, what's wrong with it being just girls.

Have some fucking manners, man.  Everyone is supposed to share. \n\nSTOP HOSTING EVERYONE.  do a potluck.\n\nSTOP INVITING HIM.  he is a savage and so is his shitty girlfriend", "NTA,  Pot luck is a good idea.  You could always prepare food in portions for the number of guests.  Serve each person the same amount, like at a restaurant.  There are not second helpings when eating out.  Surely this guy just eats normally when out in public and maybe you are such a good cook he enjoys your food so he eats as much as he can.  His partner should not be so offended, she knows how he eats.  Also, a girls night is not odd when she is the only one married and bringing her husband along.  Something is amiss here, for sure.  She shouldn\u2019t have reacted as strongly as she did.  Maybe another conversation would clear things up.  Good luck.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude to not consider others when you serve up your portions/take seconds. He could have served himself a smaller portion/waited for seconds until everyone else had eaten. He obviously knows he eats a lot. He should offer to bring a dish or control his eating for one night. He totally knows what he\u2019s doing. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised he does it at home too and lets others go hungry. \n\nI\u2019d suggest potlucks in the future.", "NTA \n\nJust posting because I see a lot of people asking the same thing.

With friends, pizza comes we all eat a slice, and another slice. Ooo - 4 more for me !\n\nI figured it out - I watch what others are plating and duplicate that. I eat less now days and if I'm still hungry, fast food drive thru bonus! on the way home.", "NTA. Been there. My friends husband eats 3x more than the rest of us. Made BBQ chicken one night. There were 6 of us so I used 9 chicken breasts  thinking there would be enough. One of my friends needed to go pump (she had recently had a baby) before we ate. 4 of us went through the line (self serve) and he went through as the 5th person. He took ALL the chicken that was left. When she came back in to get a plate, there was none left for her. My bf was so pissed. We anticipate having leftovers and he ate almost half of the food! We quit doing meals like that after.", "Why did you have to give that explanation?  Girls night was reason enough.  Its like you deliberately ignited the situation", "Friends come in all shapes and sizes. \nSo do their partners. \n\nJust offer everyone the same food and he can ransack his own fridge when he returns home. \n\nSounds like drama for nothing.", "NTA.  Sounds like yeah, no inviting her then.  Good idea to cancel", "NTA It\u2019s lovely that you love to host. But if money is tight, you need to do it less or have your friends chip in . Interesting that the woman called asking why just the girls.  Clearly she knows her husband eats like a horse. Instead of trying to help deal with the situation, the friend slags you in front of your other friends. Some friend. Save a little more by dropping her invitation as well", "NTA, but.  You need a more sustainable solution than \"don't invite the husband\".   Make it a potluck.  Ask people to VenMo you per person.  Serve something cheaper.\n\nYou can't afford to feed all these people, so it's time to let go of the rope.  If they want fancy food, they can chip in.", "NTA: She asked, you were honest. Maybe she should teach her gluttonous husband some manners. It takes a lot of nerve as a guest to just wolf down all the food so that not every one else has a chance to eat. It is horribly disrespectful to everyone there.", "If money is tight, then don't host a dinner.  Basic adulting here.\n\nNTA but you are unwise", "This reminds me of the beach house episode of Girls where Marnie planned a fancy dinner for just them but Hannah invited Elijah and two other dudes without asking Marnie and there wasn't enough food for everyone to get a full serving and they all made fun of her for not having enough food, which was ironic because it was their fault there wasn't enough.\n\nI think the friend suspected her husband was being purposely excluded, even if she didn't know why (especially if he's the only guy there, usually), but I would never have the gall to ask the host/ess why they were choosing to do a girls' night (or potluck, or buffet, or no kids, etc.) and think she was an AH for doing so.  She could've always declined.  Instead, she pushed OP for an answer.  Even if OP hadn't been honest (which could have been delivered softer--I would be too ashamed to ever show my face in that friend group again if I was told my husband ate our host into the poorhouse), it would have just come up again the next time she wanted to have a girls' only night.  ESH.", "Either this is fake or OP just doesn\u2019t like her friend\u2019s husband and is using his appetite as an excuse. \n\nHe eats 3x the amount as others.

If you're tight on money, don't host dinner. Also it's lame that your friends complain about something that's free and takes no effort on their part. Maybe do an at home movie night and only do snacks.", "If your budget is that tight, don't host a dinner party.\n\nGirls night doesn't sound bad, just do it potluck style or a snacks/movie night maybe, have people bring some snacks and wine, nothing expensive or fancy but still a nice gettogether", "You are not the asshole. If your friends do not understand you are tight on budget after you explain, you can drop them as friends.", "NTA.\n\nI think you embarrassed your friend and she's lashing out, I wonder if your other friends have noticed the same thing if they've hosted dinner parties. \n\nYou shouldn't need to justify yourself as to why he's not invited, particularly if no one else is married. I'm imagining that he's the only man there (maybe I'm wrong) and he's just stuffing himself because a) he's genuinely hungry, or b) he thinks that women don't eat as much c) he's just greedy, d) your food is delicious. \n\nQuestion - is it possible that you do serve smaller plates than other people?  Something to think about. \n\nEither way, if he's eating as much food as you say he is, this is not about you not being a good host.  He's being greedy. If he comes again, I would put out bread at the start of the meal and make sure you add a carb like rice, potato or pasta, and put food on the plates without allowing people to help themselves.  \n\nThat all sounds very stressful, to be honest, and you shouldn't have to police everyone's food, but it's obviously an issue.", "NTA", "NTA I honestly don\u2019t like ppl who eat that much. I definitely understand your reasoning in not wanting him to come. We had this same thing happen over Thanksgiving. BIL came with his bf and they took WAY too many plates home. Everyone hadn\u2019t even ate yet and weren\u2019t able to get certain stuff because it was gone. \nIf sucks that some of your friends are taking her side. From now on you should make everyone pinch in for get togethers. Take the burden off of yourself.", "Wow. Don\u2019t host the party. If you can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t afford it.

You should have just said, \"Oh, I thought it would be fun!\" If she resisted, you could have said, \"Oh I didn't even think about it leaving out your husband, maybe we could make plans that involve him next month!\" or whatever. Telling \"the truth\" was a dick move.\n\nI also feel weird about calling it \"the truth\", to be honest. Even if he is eating twice as much as the female guests, what are you serving that two additional portions is breaking the bank? The only way I could see that is if you were serving everyone full steaks or something. \n\nIF the husband is really eating THAT much more than everyone else, you had to have made the food already, right? Or was there a \"first\" dinner party where he complained/left hungry? For you to even know he was eating that much, he'd had to have had the option to, right? If the food is there at a party, I assume it's for eating. When I am hosting, I don't want picked-through leftovers remaining. \n\nIf he's like, asking for more food or something, then I'd amend my judgment. But this feels like a weird story.", "NTA. I can see why your friend feels that way, but you are not TA for telling her the truth. I hope you guys can talk again and understand each other's perspective.

But if everyone already took a serving and he goes up for seconds or thirds, the that\u2019s different. Also the type of dish matters. If for example the meat was the main focus of the dish (pork, steak, roast beef, etc.) then you usually need to allocate about 1/2 lb of meat per person for a dinner party, so needing to get her husband 1.5 lbs all for himself is crazy.

Or even that you just want to do one more before everyone finds someone and gets busy with their own lives. Why not just say you thought it would be a fun thing to do, it\u2019s been a while. Or that you just wanted to change things up a bit. Test the waters. It\u2019s rare girl groups all find men that want to do couples groups things. \nBut the opportunity presented itself and you went full tilt.

If the reason was that he made them or even one of them uncomfortable she should know, if the reason was something that could wreck or potentially wreck the friendship or even the whole girl group- she should know. Or if it was something that maybe she could change or speak to him about and resolve. She should know. And lastly if it\u2019s something avoidable or a sensitive matter. She should know. So good on her for not just sitting there and wondering or sitting there and taking it. She was being proactive. And potentially protective (something a good partner should be!) \n\nBut all and all.. given the small bit you gave us of information on the matter- YTA and I think you just let it all out on purpose.

He knows he will out eat everyone so he doesn't eat til everyone else has. YTA though. You don't have to have dinner parties and leave one person out. Just go out go dinner and have people over for snacks and drinks after. Or do a pot luck", "Don\u2019t have dinner parties if you cannot afford it", "Wow, you're an asshole!", "So. I think you should rethink your menu. If he\u2019s eating 3 servings, to the point that others have to order take out, it sounds like you aren\u2019t making enough food.  Yes money is tight. But make a casserole. Or a gumbo, or beef bourgeon. There are lots of cheaper party dishes that don\u2019t break the bank.", "I would be embarrassed to have said anything but mortified to invite people over and not have extra for everyone to eat their fill. Make it a potluck or ask people to chip in.", "YTA for putting the blame on him. He's a firefighter, he uses a lot of energy in his work of course he'd be hungrier and have bigger portions. But it's not that he eats more, it's that you can't afford it.\n\nYour pride blames him instead of your own wallet. You'd rather exclude him then fess up that you can't host a gathering. Literally just have everyone bring a dish if you can't afford to host.\n\nIT IS YOUR FAULT, NOT HIS. Quit throwing your money problems on an innocent person.", "YTA You shouldn't host until you can afford to feed your guests appropriately. \n\nMy friend likes to host dinner and thinks she's the best cook in the group also. Of course none of us will tell her she's not that great at it. But it makes her happy so we all go. If she asked us to help pitch in money for the food, we would probably stop going. The rest of us would rather have food from a restaurant or a frozen lasagna than eat her food. But again, we have fun together so I can suck up a couple hours of my life and pretend like she's such a great cook.\n\nHowever, I always make sure I eat before I go because she makes courses that are so time consuming to prep and cook or set she can't make enough for everyone to be full. I have discussed this with the other people in the group and they have expressed the same thing. She also doesn't know about eating a balanced diet. Sometimes the meal will just be a bunch of dips and crackers and chips. Dips which she spent days making. I've had my blood sugar drop so low before I have almost passed out. The food was gone and we were watching a movie. From then on I also bring a bag of some snacks so I can go eat them in the bathroom if I get super hungry.\n\nWhen I host, if there's not enough food for people to take home leftovers (if they want them), then I wasn't a good host. I would NEVER ask people to give me money for the menu I put together because they don't have a say in the food I'm preparing. I'm not going to have them resent me for making them pay for something they may not like. That's really shitty to ask people for money when they don't have a choice in the food. If someone asked me to give them money for the food they made that I didn't have a say in, I'd probably stop going to their dinner parties. And probably stop hanging out with them altogether because they might ask me for money for other things. \n\nYou should just do a potluck. When we do potlucks, we put together a Googlesheet that includes food categories; protein, vegetables, carbohydrate, dessert, appetizer, beverages, etc. We each pick two and put our name next to it and what we're going to bring. It's possible that you don't like your friends' food, therefore you're not willing to do a potluck. But this is the same as forcing your friends to eat the food you make and have them pay for it. They may not like it.\n\nFor all the people that are saying the friend's husband is the asshole for eating all the food, that's what a dinner party is. As a host, YOU provide enough food for everyone so they can go home satiated. He would be an asshole guest if got so drunk he passes out on the couch or throws up in the bathroom. If you can't afford to feed your guests, then YTA for holding everyone hostage at your house and barely feeding them when you could have just put one or two family sized lasagnas in the oven. \n\nPeople nowadays seem to misunderstand what it means to be a host. You cater to your guests, not the other way around. Not having enough food or making people pay for their food when they don't have a choice in what they're paying for is bad manners and doesn't make you a host, it makes you a poser.\n\nIn all this, your NTA for keeping it a girl's night. Although you should have just said something like, \"I was thinking of keeping it a lady's night because we don't get to spend that much time together with just us ladies.\" But this doesn't deobligate you from making enough food for everyone. If there isn't enough food for leftovers, you didn't provide enough food and one of your friends might be in the bathroom eating something they brought because you couldn't afford to be a real host. For everyone's information, I usually bring grapes, blueberries, and some beef jerky.", "Everywhere I go as a guest they encourage me to eat a lot and I feel pressured to eat more than I want. I don't believe I've ever encountered a host that invited people only to limit the offerings. Unless they ran out, of course.", "Hmm weird story.  \nIf one person makes or breaks your \"party budget\", them maybe you should lay off the parties for awhile.\n\nI'm not exactly \"good\" with money, but if you're broke, then stop buying shit you don't need.", "YTA Telling her something like that is very tactless.

I have a firefighter husband, and on MANY occasions we\u2019ve discussed etiquette around his appetite. \n\nUsually our solution is have the first round of dinner at our place, then go out.

It took him rummaging through our kitchen and eating an entire box of special chocolates that were gifted to me, for my family to speak up to him about his behavior.\n\nOP did nothing wrong with bringing it up to her friend that her husband eats far more than his share.", "In my family, we served the children first and then the adults got plates.

I\u2019m still hungry and thinking about ordering a pizza or something. Do you mind? Would anyone else like anything?\u201d", "As an ADHD girlie I\u2019m very impressed that those people know what 80% full feels like. I just guess on my portions and hope I\u2019m not surprise hungry two hours later lol", "Japan is a much older country than the USA - It's cities were created before cars were invented. North American cities are very much not walkable and most Americans seem to lead a very sedentary lifestyle.", "and why did they blame her instead of him? if the amount of food she makes is normally plenty for the group why would they get mad at her for not making enough instead of him for clearly taking more than his share", "Okay so at least I'm not the only one that read it that way.\n\nIf that's the case it's a total lie that she's providing enough food in the first place, and probably is either way tbh. Her story is essentially that she made eight servings worth of food for six people, and at least two guests were so hungry after their serving that they literally ordered take out. If she had five people then yea she might have had a bit of leftovers but it's not because the sixth was a pig.\n\nOrdering take out to someone else's dinner party because there isn't enough food totally eclipses taking an extra serving in terms of poor etiquette, yet they thought it was warranted. This does not support her \"I make plenty of food and am very good at portion sizes\" idea.", "It\u2019s got my vote!!!", "He likes OP'S food,  and he and his wife are looking for a free meal.  Imagine cooking for him every day, let OP feed us tonight", "Or, she made the mistake of marrying a controlling possessive person and he gives her a hard time for doing anything without him.", "Maybe, but when you ask a question, you need to accept the answer.", "Lol, yup", "Or maybe she just wants to be go out with him. Or maybe she wanted to know why her husband was not invited. OP gave her answer and it\u2019s up to the friend to decide if she wants to go or not. I personally would not.", "Damn, my husband would be shoving me out the door, excited I made a friend \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "Sometimes my husband will come home from a party and have leftovers or a bowl of cereal.  Everyone's happy.", "I just make sure to ask if anyone else wants any more before I go for seconds, never had any objections unless there was literally no food left", "Ye gods, what an ass.", "I feel like not enough parents teach this sort of social etiquette anymore. \n\nI know that my father didn't even try, though. My silent generation grandmother certainly imparted that information to me, though. Otherwise, no adult in my life would have taught that to me.", "This is the way and I want 100% agree! Unless you are the one bankrolling, otherwise be mindful! \n\nUnfortunately most people are lacking these social graces. My father, being one of them. I\u2019ve even made it a point to say \u201coh great I\u2019m gonna have this for lunch\u201d referencing what\u2019s left on my plate and then not even a minute later he\u2019s eating it while burping because he is full.", "I swear basic etiquette isn't taught any more, and when people try, they get attacked by the self-centered and the entitled. \n\nIf there's food left over, and everyone else has had a first serving, I think it's perfectly fine to ask about seconds. But the ass in OP's story got all grumpy when food ran out the first time he was invited to dinner (before OP started doubling the recipes), and made it everyone else's problem so that everyone at the party was upset. Trash like that needs to be left at home.", "That reminds me of an ex fianc\u00e9! We were at a dinner at brothers and there were a couple of appetizers. One was a plate of expensive sushi. There were six of us and I remember being mortified that he kept shoveling the sushi. I think there was 15-18 so no more than 2 or 3 a person. He grew up in a wealthy home, got his masters from USC\u2026.I will never forget how disgusted and embarrassed I was. There is plenty of food! You are not starving.", "100%\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re shoveling it down and not even tasting the food.\n\nAnd chronic over eating can stretch your stomach making it harder to feel full.", "And why wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s response to then bring an extra dish, or even some damn bread, the next time.", "OMG thank you! I missed that!", "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "I always wonder if women who do that want to bring their husbands or if the husbands insist on going and won\u2019t let their wives go out by themselves", "I've read too many stories of control freak husbands to think this is all her doing", "Thank you! I needed that laugh.", "I have a gay dude friend who is always invited to girl's nights with our crew, but his boyfriend is not invited. They know how girl's night works.", "She could be the controlling exhausting one. No way to tell.", "You're right", "i've had 4yo campers understand this concept better than many grown adult men bc we made it into the lunchtime routine. definitely needs to be taught", "It\u2019s funny how good at fractions my kids get when we\u2019re calculating desert portions.", "100% agree.\n\nHe wasn't rude for wanting more food. He was rude for not reading the room, not waiting to be offered, not asking, laughing when other people had to order takeout, whining when he didn't get enough food, and finally, his wife was rude to ask why he wasn't invited.", "this is the part that gets me the most. your friend, someone you ostensibly care about and the only person in your group that ever cooks for you all, confides that they can't afford enough food for everyone. and your immediate reaction isn't to *offer help*?? idk every get-together i've ever been to, you ALWAYS ask the host beforehand what you can bring. even like just as college kids hanging out", "Happy to provide.  ;)", "The only girls night I've had with a husband there was with a new friend but\n\n1. It was for her birthday and \n2. It was at her house and \n3. She had just had a baby so her husband was there to like, hang out and help with said baby.\n\nPretty chill dude. We all kinda nerded out (all the girls were more into different books, shows, and anime, so that's what we ended up talking about the most), and if he had nothing to say, he just kinda played with the baby.\n\nWith that exception out of the way, girls night is...girls night. We have a girls only book club that husbands aren't invited to. \n(I guess I shouldn't say girls only. It's more like \"only women have joined, spouses or partners are not invited, they stay home with the kids\")", "My ex-wife was very controlling and made me come to girls nights, so she'd feel \"comfortable\"", "While I agree with your sentiments, Life isn\u2019t a basic cable television show. Men can enjoy being around women and whether it\u2019s a mixed group or they are the only and vice versa. I just think it needs to be every time.", "I know so many guys that would out girl the girls at girls night. Biggest gossips ever. And love being pampered. \n\nAnd most guys I know get stoked to be in the girls club - they get to hear things and experience things few men get to because they're fragile and afraid of what others think. \n\nNot to mention hearing about how casually we talk about abuse we've received and that it's near universal. It changes men when they are forced to listen.\n\nThey're all straight and in healthy relationships.", "I agree but in this case I suspect it\u2019s more to do with the fella being upset about missing out his opportunity for a spot at the free buffet, or perhaps more fittingly trough. Either way, it\u2019s ridiculous to not be able to hang out with friends independently sometimes."]}
