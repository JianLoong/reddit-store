My daughter is clearly jealous of her and has been very mean towards her.\n\nA few days ago we all went shopping and my niece went missing in the crowd.

I told her that niece is missing and she said good I hope she is not found and went back to her phone so when we got home I grounded her for a month. She thinks I was the asshole\n\nEditt: so I'm gonna give you a quick update while I figure out how to deal with her now. I decided to have a conversation with her about her feelings and behavior towards her cousin. We didn't have much of a conversation because she kept crying and screaming at me, listing all the times everyone ignored her or favored my niece. I honestly didn't realize how awful we have been to her. She is my little girl and I never meant to make her feel like this. I'm going to talk to my family and tell them we need to throw her a late birthday party since we had to skip her birthday because my niece was very sick. It will be a day only about her and from now on we have to be more careful about how we treat her.

She's not an adult and since there's some murky circumstances here I'm ready to bet that some stuff has happened in her life that have caused her emotional turmoil that isn't just about the 6yo niece.\n\nBTW, rainbow babies are a dumb concept and your family subscribing to this idea already says a lot about you all.\n\nWell balanced 17yos aren't jealous of a 6yo when the family dynamics are healthy and safe. 11yo may be jealous of a new baby (understandably), but even then there's ways to work with that. Did the grandparents still spend time with her? Did people still talk about her stuff or was the baby all everyone could talk about? Did you still make sure she understood that she's the most important for you, that niece isn't even close to being as important to you?\n\nAnd what is this family activity you're doing that everyone needs to be there for at a mall? 17yo and 6yo have very different things they enjoy. If this was dinner at a restaurant why didn't you leave with your daughter when it was over? If it was a movie or activity what could it possibly have been that the kids with 11 years between them could've possibly both enjoyed? Did your daughter want to be there in the first place? And how the hell do you people let a 6yo get lost on the 1st place?

When did it start, when she was 11? Why have you allowed it to go on this long? Have you gotten to the bottom of her reasoning, has she said that she's jealous of the attention?\n\nAll in all I think your daughter has issues, I'm willing to bet that many of them come from somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics and you not knowing how to parent her. Get her a personal therapist who is there just for her (since apparently there isn't such a person currently in her life) and do family therapy on top of that.

They were negligent allowing her to wander off", "Special like a rainbow baby\u2026", ">I\u2019m sorry if it came off that way, but I\u2019m just trying to give an example of shitty parents and how it doesn\u2019t mean you have to take it out on the wrong people.\n\nShe's 17 years old. Still developing and not understanding why what is happening is occurring. I'm not saying her behavior is okay, but I think it's kind of silly of you to think that teenagers need to just accept adults are shitty sometimes. \n\nSounds to me like you took being a golden child to your head in high school.", "Your daughter found out about you when she was 9. A whole entire new family she didn\u2019t know about. She had 2 years of attention from your family before your niece was born. Then what? At only 11 they stopped paying attention to her? Yeah I\u2019d be bitter too if my feelings got yanked around like that. especially if my own father didn\u2019t consider me to be a child in the family (you called your niece the only child in the family but\u2026she wasn\u2019t ever the only child you knew about your daughter by the time she was born )", ">My niece was a rainbow baby and the only child in our family(I found out about my daughter when she was 9 so we missed most of her childhood) so naturally she gets a lot of attention.\n\nYour post contradicts that statement. Maybe the actual issue is you're acting like a \"rainbow baby\" is some second coming when it's just another kid in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAlso your daughter should be the center of attention in your life and clearly she's not.", "SERIOUSLY??? So she got two years of attention and should just get over it? By your own words they stopped fawning over her when your niece came along, meaning she was all of 11 when she got tossed to the side. Very much still a child, who got ZERO attention for them 0-9 cause you didn't know about her.", "YTA massively. She didnt have you in her life for 9 years. (Love how you are dodging answering why you weren't in her life for all those years) then she gets lost of attention from the ages 9-11 (11 is around the time most girls are starting puberty etc and NEED support) and then NIECE comes along and she is shunted to the side like a red headed step child by not just her aunt and uncle (understandable considering it's their kid) but also her own grandparents, any other aunts and uncles and HER OWN FATHER. Be prepared to come home the day she turns 18 and find her gone. TBH if I was your child I would rather live on the street than be anywhere near you and your obvious DISDAIN for your own CHILD (education for you here 0-18 are classed as Children).", "Imagine making up an entire scenario on your head based on 3 paragraphs on Reddit. Tossed aside and forgotten, seriously? You have no evidence of this at all.", "There are also things like priorities. Multiple things can be true at the same time. 17 year old may need help (which they should have gotten her help as soon as she was exhibiting mean behavior to a 6 year old- ALTHOUGH we don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in therapy, etc. so hard to even judge there) and an actively missing child. We can deal with the resentment later, a child missing in the moment is priority. At 17 you should be able to understand those concepts.", "No. \"Good. I hope she's not found.\" needs consequences.", "Also, fawn over the niece for something the niece had no part in. It's like fawning over someone for being born with ten toes.", "At 17, it's quite possible the damage is done and he missed his chance to do better.  I can't imagine their relationship will improve much once she moves out, if there is any relationship at all.  Everybody's different but if I found out I had a 9 yo, I would do everything possible to make up for lost time and make her feel loved. OP  YTA, your niece is not your daughter, you DAUGHTER.   I also hate how you use \"rainbow child\" to describe the niece even though she's now 6.", "We have no evidence that she\u2019s neglected. Just because the adults don\u2019t fawn over her as if she\u2019s 6 doesn\u2019t make her neglected. If they did it would probably annoy her at all 17. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what the circumstances for niece wandering off were. As a parent I\u2019ve not lost a child yet, but I\u2019m not going to put money on the fact that they\u2019ll never wander off (no matter how carefully I think I\u2019m watching them). \n\nIt\u2019s the sort of situation that you would do the \u201cif I was a stranger, would I stop to help\u201d test on. It\u2019s basic compassion to look for a lost child, even if you have no responsibility or family connection to them.", "We\u2019re both on the same page no? It\u2019s like saying teenagers are still developing, but need to be excused for not acknowledging that certain actions are morally wrong. There are certain guidelines for how to be a good person that no one follows all the time. We all slip up.\n\nYes. Of course. But that doesn\u2019t excuse their actions. Only gives a justification and reasoning. OP punished their daughter reasonably for making a mistake. I also fucked up and didn\u2019t acknowledge that my actions were hurting people beyond the shitty adult in my life. I\u2019m sorry for it and know I did something wrong in hindsight, and maybe I\u2019m projecting but I\u2019ve seen this pattern so much and been in both the girl and the niece\u2019s shoes in my life that I already know this girl will regret her treatment of her cousin. \n\nMeanwhile my brother has never taken shit out on me, despite his own shitty life, and I seriously admire, love and appreciate him for it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you continue to insult me for no reason. Feels like odd pettiness for me stating a fact from my own life.", "They still pay a lot of attention to her but naturally a baby is gonna get more attention than an older kid", "[OPs comment history is pretty telling, bud](https://reddit.com/u/Key_Phase_9349/s/739hbVopmK)\n\neta: and his new update? lol. lmao.", "A 6 year old isn't a baby.", "A six year old isn\u2019t considered a baby. At 6 they aren\u2019t even considered a toddler.", "I\u2019ve read the comment history and nowhere does it say she was tossed to the side. I read it as an 11 year old only grandchild/ nibbling who now had to share attention with a new baby. Yes you don\u2019t have all of the attention anymore, it doesn\u2019t mean you were tossed to the side. That\u2019s normal when other children come into the family."]}
