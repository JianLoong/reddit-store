This is an emotional response to something -- either your treatment (or perceived treatment) of her or deep seated issues.\n\nYou would do better by getting the entire family into counseling in order to address what the issues are.\n\nHer being grounded like that are just going to foster more ill will towards your 'beloved rainbow baby'.\n\nHer actions and what she said werent acceptable behaviors, however repercussions for those would be therapy, not punishment.", "You don't sound like you like your daughter at all to be honest.

I was always called 'the wean' (Scottish for child), I still get called that and I'm in my 30s now. As you can imagine I was the front, centre, be-all, and end-all, when it came to birthdays, holidays, events you name it I was always spoiled even when it wasn't about me, I still got things because they didn't want me to feel left out or they had been away on holiday and brought me a gift back. \n\nThen comes along my baby cousin. This is where you made the very first mistake. From the moment my parents found out I was no longer going to be the one and only, they sat me down and explained what was happening and how things would change for me from other people. But they reassured me that I would always be their one and only and nothing would change from them. My pregnant aunt (my favourite aunt) took me out for dinner and explained that she knew it was a big transition not just for her but for me also. She asked me how I felt about the new baby and about becoming a big cousin. I told her 'I know I have no experience being a big cousin but I'll be the best big cousin to my baby cousin). She was surprised that I didn't freak out and was so calm and happy. She also asked me to be godmother and told me the sex of the baby and asked me to keep it a secret.\n\nShe involved me in the whole progress throughout her pregnancy, I got to go to scans and help her pick out all the things for the nursery. I went to the classes with her and learned as she was learning. (We don't talk about my uncle). She asked my mum and me to be her birthing partners as we had been her support network throughout the whole thing (we still don't talk about my uncle). \n\nIf my parents and aunt hadn't been so thoughtful and inclusive with the whole process I probably would have acted the way your daughter has.\n\n You can feel extremely isolated, ignored and shunned being excluded from something that has been your whole identity since birth(or since connecting). Especially when you cancelled her birthday because your niece was sick. That probably solidified her boiling anger and rage towards her cousin and the thing is, it isn't anything your niece has done to your daughter. It's the way all the adults have treated her and her cousin. Y'all have abruptly thrown your daughter from the pedestal that y'all put her on and replaced her with your niece. Your daughter is lying on the ground, broken and smashed, staring up at where she used to call home, only to see her cousin sitting safe and soundly.\n\nThis is going to sound harsh but you are an asshole for cancelling her birthday and then not rescheduling it! Your actions basically say your niece is more important than your daughter.\n\nDon't expect her to be nice to anyone after that stunt. Sick kid or not. Unless she was dying there's no excuse. Call me a heartless bitch or an asshole if you want but this is from her point of view. \n\nPut yourself in her shoes, you are excited about your birthday party, even if you don't outwardly show it, and then it's suddenly cancelled because your kid cousin is sick. \n\nThen never rescheduled! \n\nDiscarded. \nForgotten. \nReplaced.\n\nHaving a party now will seem like you are trying to make up for grounding and yelling at her. \n\nWhat you need to do is apologise. \n\nApologise for the birthday party. \n\nAsk if she wants a redo of the party. \n\nApologise for yelling and grounding. \n\nAsk her why she has those feelings towards her kid cousin and then apologise if it was something that you have caused. \n\nYou need to have a sit-down, anger and attitudes aside, conversation about why she's upset, start from the beginning and work through it. It may take some time but if you two can work through it, you will come out of it with a stronger bond. \n\nShe might need time to get to a point where she can talk without crying and getting angry but make a safe space. The living room for instance and make sure there aren't any interruptions, no one else randomly dropping in. Start light, ask her how she is feeling, and let her talk without interrupting, she might answer straight with one-word answers or she might ramble on, let her. Allow her to get whatever it is off her chest, it might be quick and easy or it might take multiple sit-downs. But most importantly listen.\n\nIt might be a good idea to choose a time and day that suits both of you to have the sit-downs regularly I.e. Sundays at 8 pm every week or the first Wednesday of the month at 4 pm. Even pick a place, for example, a coffee shop, restaurant, cafe, going for a walk or a small road trip.\n\nYou just need to talk to each other and it's up to you to make the first move. \n\nHope this helped see it from her perspective.", "YTA.

Is she being emotional, or are you BOTH being emotional but your emotions make sense to you because they're yours so you don't see them?

My parents had two stillbirths  before me -- one kid born okay, the next two stillbirths -- and I think they'd stopped trying and I was an accident, because they didn't think the problem would be fixed.  There was definitely a degree of treating me as special, but I wasn't the only cousin in my age group, and my older brother never resented me, so I think my parents weren't too bad about it. I think that making a much bigger deal about it is a more recent thing.  And I wonder if that's because in earlier times, a lot more people experienced miscarriages and stillbirths and people just thought of that as an expected risk. Sure, they thought of a late kid, after previous problems, as a blessing or whatever, usually, but... I don't know.)\n\nAnyway, when I've seen it used before, it's often in stories of people who had tried for a long time to have a baby and who experienced various setbacks.", "Oh wow - I thought it was part of that \"Indigo children\" \"Crystal children\" \"Rainbow children\" thing.", "I\u2019m sorry.

It was never about you.", "My sister was the same, except I honestly don't know the gender of the baby mom lost, it never came up.

When I was born four years later, medical technology had advanced to the point where doctors were able to save me (with some major intervention).  I really only realized much much later that after the second stillborn child, my parents had stopped trying for a new baby, and I think that despite being Catholics, they were using birth control.  So I was an unplanned-for baby -- but not \"unwanted\".  And my parents never even really talked about me being an \"oops\" baby.

If your cycle is irregular and widely spaced, look for other symptoms of pregnancy, and if it is much farther than is typical, see your doctor.  \n\nAs is the case with school textbooks, the book was several years old by the time we were using it.  (I think copyright around 1980 for a class taken in 1987.)\n\nNo mention of home pregnancy tests, at all.  Certainly nothing about knowing you're pregnant before a missed cycle.

Mothers/female partners are often responsible for the emotional labor in the extended family relationship and a man who has never been expected to involve themselves in that part may not even know where to begin, and may not recognize when they or other family members are falling short. If the extended family aren't willing or don't want to entertain the emotional labor of incorporating a new child into the family they aren't going to. That's really cruel. No adult is blameless here. \n\n\nIt's been clear for the daughter from the start that she was an outsider.
