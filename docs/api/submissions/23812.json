She always waits till late Sunday night to do all the cooking so often she'll leave the containers to cool on the counter overnight, because it is too hot to put in the fridge right away before she goes to bed. Two months ago I moved my two cats into the apartment, now in my household I don't allow them on the counters but if there is food left open they will try to get into it. I explained that she should be aware that the cats might try to eat her food or might knock it over if she leaves it out all night, but she brushed me off saying it was fine. I told her that it was only a matter of time before it happened. \n\nWell, it finally happened, I woke Monday morning to the kitchen in a mess because the cats had knocked over several containers onto the floor. I cleaned up and put the rest of the food that still looked fine into the fridge. Overall out of 7 lunches and 7 dinners, about half was ruined. When Rose got up I explained what happened and apologized. She flipped out on me, because she can't afford to buy more food for the week. Rose demanded that I buy more food because it was my animals that caused this, but I also can't afford to buy her more meals out of my own food budget. I told her I wouldn't be replacing anything because she was being irresponsible with her own food by leaving it out and I had already warned her that this might happen. She's still furious with me and some of my friends have said that I'm obligated to replace her food since it was my cats that did the damage.", "created_utc": 1691091890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hduzz/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_my_roommate_new_meals/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP actually cleaned and salvaged food which I would not have done because the roommate is responsible for having left it unattended. Now the roommate wants to be paid back, but has not mentioned changing their habit, which is unsustainable. OP's roommate fucked around and found out.  Could have been worse being food poisoning.
