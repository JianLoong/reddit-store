She always waits till late Sunday night to do all the cooking so often she'll leave the containers to cool on the counter overnight, because it is too hot to put in the fridge right away before she goes to bed. Two months ago I moved my two cats into the apartment, now in my household I don't allow them on the counters but if there is food left open they will try to get into it. I explained that she should be aware that the cats might try to eat her food or might knock it over if she leaves it out all night, but she brushed me off saying it was fine. I told her that it was only a matter of time before it happened. \n\nWell, it finally happened, I woke Monday morning to the kitchen in a mess because the cats had knocked over several containers onto the floor. I cleaned up and put the rest of the food that still looked fine into the fridge. Overall out of 7 lunches and 7 dinners, about half was ruined. When Rose got up I explained what happened and apologized. She flipped out on me, because she can't afford to buy more food for the week. Rose demanded that I buy more food because it was my animals that caused this, but I also can't afford to buy her more meals out of my own food budget. I told her I wouldn't be replacing anything because she was being irresponsible with her own food by leaving it out and I had already warned her that this might happen. She's still furious with me and some of my friends have said that I'm obligated to replace her food since it was my cats that did the damage.", "created_utc": 1691091890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hduzz/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_my_roommate_new_meals/", "score": 980, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP actually cleaned and salvaged food which I would not have done because the roommate is responsible for having left it unattended.

Cats are not nocturnal. They are crepuscular. This means they are naturally going to be awake during dawn and dusk. But, like humans, they can change their habits over time. For OP, this will mean they will get up at dawn. Unless she sleeps in until noon, there will be no problem with having the cats stay inside for an extra hour - hour and a half until she wakes up.

Keeping the cat in your room for a bit is not a problem so long as the cat considers it home base and has all the things the cat needs to feel safe. This is especially true if the owner is there with them. Do you think when teenage girls go to their room with their cat and close the door the cat is automatically feeling imprisoned? No. If the cat wants out, it will let you know, trust me. So no, closing the door when you sleep to keep your cat in will not be imprisoning your cat, at all. Both of my cats have no problem staying in our room since that's where each of them stayed when we first got them. Close the door while either one of them are outside though and  you'll hear non stop meowing to get in. Its literally because they feel our room is their room too. Living room be damned.\n\nBut you don't have to trust me, some stranger on the internet. You can just read up on it. Closing the door one night a week will not be an issue especially since that's the room they choose to sleep in anyways.\n\nEdit: But also like in my last post, I agree with the food piece.

But this is a new development she never really agreed to necessarily", "To be clear, food should never be allowed to sit at room temp (also known as 'the danger zone') for two hours. When it is heated or cooled before sitting out, it takes some time for it to get to the danger zone.", "Ehh that\u2019s her own health she\u2019s dealing with. She can do what she wants. But I feel the exact same about the cat. Leaving the food out like that can cause bad things to happen, Including having a cat knock it off the table. \n\nShe is allowed to tempt fate with her own stuff, it\u2019s not on OP to stop her.", "Roommate wants to commandeer a common room for however long it takes her to prepare 14 meals and 8 hours overnight while simultaneously attracting bugs and vermin. The obvious solution is to let it cool for a bit then put it in the fridge. You can use sheet pans to cool things down faster but the maximum food should be left out is two hours. Roommate was an asshole long before the cats got there for those reasons alone.", "A locked metal crate is very different than a bedroom. A cat will damage a wooden door and floor trying to get out. Roommate is lazy and gross leaving food out for 8 hours. She was warned. She has critical thinking skills, and should use them. \nWhen visiting anyone with animals, I know animals have animal instincts and take precautions to not leave anything out they might get into. \nI don\u2019t think OP is the AH for the cats doing cat things. Out of curtesy though she should replace the meals. Roommate should also accept it\u2019s essentially her fault though.", "Sure, you can train them... to an extent. And some cats are more trainable than others. They are essentially still untamed animals (again, this varies according to the individual cat). You adapt to them and they to you. But it's not a one-way road.", "I wonder if there was Iranian yogurt? \n\nBecause that definitely isn\u2019t the issue here! \n\n(Sorry couldn\u2019t resist)", "Yeah I'm not confining a cat in my room for 12 hours because roomy wants to leave her food out for literally the ENTIRE night. She does not have the right to request that, it is not a reasonable accommodation. Are you for real? If an animal needs to be kept in a room for an hour or two that's one thing, but I'm not locking a living being in a small room for half a day because you can't plan your shit correctly and give yourself a reasonable amount of time for it to cool off WHILE we're still up to keep an eye out. Nta op you're roommate is tah and a da.", "They both sound kinda nasty tbh", "Unless she is freezing part of it, and only taking it out the night before to thaw.   I've seen lots of meal preppers do that.   Actually something I'm going to be looking into.", "Most people freeze potions.", "She meal preps into individual containers. How long does it take an individual portion of food to get cold normally? Because it\u2019s not hot anymore 20 minutes after serving typically. Roommate is courting food poisoning.", "Humans also died from food poisoning a lot before having fridges and used other methods of preserving food like salting, smoking, pickling and cooking fresh every day.\n\nThe reason why food in hot climates is so spicy often comes from the need to cover up the taste of it starting to go off rather soon. Whilst you can make it somewhat edible again (ie won\u2019t necessarily kill you) by cooking it long and hot enough for the bacteria to die on the warm up, the iffy taste lingers.\n\nWhy risk a trip to the hospital when we now have means to avoid it?", "yeah cos all the dumbest ones died so we could invent cool things like fridges. people absolutely died from things like food poisoning back in the 1600s. they also died from STDs and cholera because they wouldn't wash their hands or bodies.\n\nIt may be fairly safe to eat food left overnight, however we know better now that putting it in the fridge after its cooled (which would really only be like half an hour?) is better for us and will most likely not give us food poisoning.", "There is a difference in a refrigerator at home and industrial scale refrigeration.  Putting in the 14 meals could warm everything in the refrigerator, especially if everything has just been cooked.  This would put everything in the fridge at risk and possibly overload the cooling capacity of the fridge eventually. \n\nThe best solution would be for the roommate to cook earlier or to set an alarm for say an hour or two to come back and put everything away.", "https://www.allrecipes.com/article/is-it-safe-to-put-hot-food-in-fridge/", "The worst part is that on rereading the containers are OPEN. But yeah, not on OP to police.", "and yet, it didn't bother op at all until she was on the hook for the damages her cat did", "Not just leaving the food out all night, but then it goes into the fridge & eaten over the next 7 days?   Is this right or is my thinking correct?", "Agreed, the roommate new it was a risk and there is no valid reason to leave them out all night. My cats would also be miserable if I locked them in one room all night", "Gonna flex your logic: if cat-owner didn't move 2 cats into the apt \"it wouldn't be an issue.\"", "Yeah. She knows there are cats in the apartment. Is she an alien? Of course the cats will mess with food. How stupid is this girl?", "The cats could have done this if the food was left out for an hour. Sure, they may have done her a favor -- an ongoing one, if she stops leaving food out because of this incident -- but that's incidental.\n\nBeing tolerant of someone else's disruptive pets in a roommate situation is a favor, even when they don't cost you money you don't have. OP has already asked her roommate to change her habits to accommodate them. She'd be not only an asshole, but foolish and self-sabotaging, to escalate this conflict by refusing to pay and doing nothing to earn the grace and tolerance of the person she lives with.", "Yes she should put things in the fridge but the risk really depends on the type of food. In any case, her risk has nothing to do with with the fact that the cats haven't been trained to stay off of the counters. Food belongs on counters. Cats do not. The OP is responsible for damage causes by cats that are somehwere they shouldn't be.", "I mean I like cats but it is petty disgusting having them walk all over your counter where you prepare food after they drop a deuce in their piss soaked litter box", "Nobody's fucking dying from freshly cooked food on the counter for a few hours and the worst 'food poisoning' you're gonna get is an upset stomach. If you're getting seriously sick from that then you either need to learn to cook or clean better.\n\nBtw, murderous bacteria don't really give a fuck how smart or dumb you are.", "This is entirely false! All it does is make the fridge work a bit harder.  Refrigerators should never frost over, if they do, it\u2019s a mechanical issue not \u201cputting hot food in the fridge.\u201d", "Otoh if roommate has it all in 14 containers or whatever she can separate them and they will cool down a lot faster.", "So... cook at 7 or 8 and put the food in the fridge at like 10 pm??\n\nLeaving most cooked foods out more than an hour or so is definitely not good, and attracted pests as well (and also cats, apparently).", "Because the roommate was told in advance \"Hey, my cats are going to do this thing,\" and roommate said \"Nah, whatever.\" and then they did the thing and now they're mad about it. Like, it did not come without warning. \"If you leave your room door open, my cats will come in and might sleep on your pillow.\" \"Okay. /closes door\"\n\nInstead, roommate is ignoring that cats are going to cat, expected somehow that the cats would just not cat around her food because... because? I don't know. Either way, roommate clearly fafo and now is trying to do that thing where their idiocy isn't their fault because they're too stupid to be held liable.", "I mean, I\u2019m prepared to be downvoted to oblivion, and I\u2019m not recommending, but my parents often left food covered and on the counter overnight. (Never  pork). I\u2019ve eaten many an improperly stored leftover and I\u2019ve never gotten sick. Knock wood\n\nAgain, not recommending. I understand food borne illness is very real, and I understand a great many of you would find my parents food storage practices *horrifying*. But leaving food out isn\u2019t a guaranteed diarrhea-stravaganza.", "But it's reasonable for a roommate to get a cat or two in most cases. It's never reasonable to leave your food out for 12 hours to cool in a shared kitchen.", "Sure, but my cats very, very rarely get on my kitchen counters. When they do, it's because I left something tasty there for too long (and never overnight FFS). That's on me.\n\nOP's roommate needs to be aware of her living situation and not leave food out. Voila, no problem!", "You can't prevent this without getting rid of the cats.", "My kitten just figured out how to.\nI\u2019m glad he learned a skill and can finally jump\nThat high(he\u2019s very underweight. Found hm abandoned at like 1/2 weeks old. So he\u2019s getting there!) so he\u2019s little. He\u2019s \u201cfar\u201dbehind on skills kitten his age typically have.

You really think warm hot food is gonna warm the entire fridge up? Sounds like an old wives tale. Please source this", "This is antiquated information. Any fridge made in the last 20 or so years can maintain it's temp even if hot food is put in there.", "i didn't say she was gonna die lol but you absolutely can get 'food poisoning' for food left out. OP said she leaves it for 8 hours and then puts it in the fridge. rice, as an example food, should only be left out for 1 hour before it develops bacteria that can be incredibly harmful. cooked meat should also only be left out for 1 hour as well. it can be perfectly cooked on sterile surfaces but bacteria doesn't give a fuck. if it's not harming her fine, but food safety is important", "What it actually does is risk warming up the nearby foods around it for extended periods of time.", "Or if she\u2019s efficient enough to meal prep, she\u2019s efficient enough to by a bag of ice and some dollar store couple inch deep trays to ice bath her dishes to cool them quicker and put them in the fridge before she goes to bed. This isn\u2019t an art project that needs to dry overnight, it\u2019s food that should be refrigerated that\u2019s being left at room temperature for multiple hours. Cats are doing the lords work \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\udcaf I've never, ever heard of warm food placed in a refrigerator raising the temp *for a day*. FFS what happens when you OPEN the refrigerator more than once in an hour? \ud83e\udd23 Now that I think about it, comment about this may be the dumbest thing I've ever heard.", "This is crazy. It does not warm your fridge up. Not enough to make an impact and definitely isn't worse than leaving food on your counter all night long", "No it's actually pretty normal to put cooked food in the fridge and not think it's going to ruin other food.", "You can put the lid. On, but don't snap it down.\n\nI put warm stuff into the fridge. Hot stuff waits for like half an hour. And I don't know where everyone is buying their fridges, but I have put a fairly warm full sized turkey in my fridge before with no issues.", "Was about to rely with a similar link", "It also depends on where you live. Hot and humid Florida? I wouldn\u2019t leave my bread out for 5 min.
