That should be the end of it, it should be a non-issue at that point. \n\nThe real problem is how she's manipulating you and why I posted the religious analogy, it's plain as day to see that it's not cool in that circumstance. You hold yourself to your standard. She holds herself to another. But she's trying to impose her standard on you against your wishes at threat of emotional blackmail, she'll be sad. \n\nWell, you can't fix someone's sadness, that's also true, that comes from within, it comes from personal choices or from external professional help and working through issues in therapy or medication. Even then it's managing an issue, not fixing it most of the time. \n\nThe next time she says she'll be sad or it's a deal breaker reply with \"ok\". Just \"ok\".

That's what compromise and relationships are about, right? It wouldn't really cost you anything to not eat the eggs, and it would make her happy, so that seems like a fairly small ask on her part.\n\nBut also, she doesn't get to dictate your diet. I'm vegan too (and would at least consider eating the eggs you've described because I agree with your reasoning), but my partner eats meat. It makes me sad (I guess?) when they eat meat, but it's not my place to dictate what other people eat, and I'm not responsible for other people's dietary sins. It seems like she could offer up a compromise too, and let you eat what you think it's right to eat.\n\nBasically, she's not an asshole for being sad, and you're not an asshole for living your own life. If eating eggs is a dealbreaker for her, then I guess you have to decide if not eating eggs is a dealbreaker for you.\n\nAnd for everyone going on about \"fucking insufferable vegans\": if it was \"I like kicking my dog, but it makes my girlfriend sad, am I an asshole if I keep kicking my dog?\" you'd all be voting the other way. From the girlfriend's point of view, taking eggs from chickens is using the chicken, and kicking a dog because you like it is using the dog, and neither chickens nor dogs are here to be used for our purposes. I'm not here to argue about whether laying eggs causes more or less harm to a chicken than kicking your dog, and I'm not saying anyone needs to agree with her. I'm just saying that, given her beliefs, you can understand why someone might be insufferable about this, because if we were talking about kicking dogs, you'd be insufferably militant about that too.", "I cringe at the argument that the only way you can be healthy is with a 100% animal free diet that is not out of medical necessity; there are certain nutrients/cell building blocks that only come from animal sources (even the nutritional supplements can be made from animal sources to best meet those requirements).

Factory farming is shit, it's hell for the animals. BUT, a vegan lifestyle isn't cruelty free. The amount of abuse that goes on with the people who harvest fruits and veggies is awful, the land is still being exploited, the ones that aren't harvested by hand are harvested by machines that spew pollution into the air. There is no ethical consumption because it's impossible to be completely cruelty free in our modern world. Also, humans' evolution hinged on the cooking and eating of meat. Our brains evolved because we started eating meat and animal products like eggs.

Bad comparison.", "The fact that you are comparing kicking a dog and physically harming it to eating eggs from free to roam chickens is insane. One is a very objectively sad and abusive thing and the other is not. No it wouldn\u2019t cost him anything to not eat the eggs, but her problem with it is irrational.

Others have called it: MANIPULATION. If the fact that the two of you disagreeing makes her \"sad\" to the point that she calls your action (which she admits she has no ethical or moral problem with) a deal breaker, the underlying message is: if you disagree with me, I will threaten to leave. I know this is extremely simplified and veganism is anything but, however I don't understand how this can actually be about \"what food is\" if she has no opposition to these particular eggs.

Most Vegans are hypocrites or ignorant. Tons of animals, insects and such die in the growing of the food she eats. The electronics she uses was made at least in part by child or slave labor.

If you don't respect her choice and you are using this to antagonize her, then I'd say yes, you ATA. Because then it's an issue of communication. You can disagree with her philosophically, but is this the way you want to let that be known?\n\nDo you feel she is manipulating you? Or does she honestly just have empathy for the chickens?

People who keep small backyard animals who produce renewable food products\u2014 and often more product than a single family alone can use, and therefore give them away to neighbors and friends\u2014 are doing more to help reduce factory farming than vegans.
