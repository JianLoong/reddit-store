That should be the end of it, it should be a non-issue at that point. \n\nThe real problem is how she's manipulating you and why I posted the religious analogy, it's plain as day to see that it's not cool in that circumstance. You hold yourself to your standard. She holds herself to another. But she's trying to impose her standard on you against your wishes at threat of emotional blackmail, she'll be sad. \n\nWell, you can't fix someone's sadness, that's also true, that comes from within, it comes from personal choices or from external professional help and working through issues in therapy or medication. Even then it's managing an issue, not fixing it most of the time. \n\nThe next time she says she'll be sad or it's a deal breaker reply with \"ok\". Just \"ok\". Let that sink in for her as a reality, coz she's threatening a breakup, she's using the threat to manipulate you again. if it was a deal breaker, she'd be gone already. People don't stick around for deal breakers, they break it off and leave! \n\nThe power lies in her threat, the power is lost if you accept it. Don't be held hostage to emotional manipulation. Call it out. \"Alright, I'm sorry you can't accept me for who I am, I'm sorry you made the decision that our relationship is over, which of us needs to move out of where we live and what property do we need to divide\". \n\nIf she decides to roll that back and take back what she said, it's time to address the elephant in the room, the emotional blackmail, manipulation and holding ending the relationship over your head like a dangling knife.

That's what compromise and relationships are about, right? It wouldn't really cost you anything to not eat the eggs, and it would make her happy, so that seems like a fairly small ask on her part. \n\nBut also, she doesn't get to dictate your diet. I'm vegan too (and would at least consider eating the eggs you've described because I agree with your reasoning), but my partner eats meat. It makes me sad (I guess?) when they eat meat, but it's not my place to dictate what other people eat, and I'm not responsible for other people's dietary sins. It seems like she could offer up a compromise too, and let you eat what you think it's right to eat. \n\nBasically, she's not an asshole for being sad, and you're not an asshole for living your own life.
