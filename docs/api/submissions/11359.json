I text my brother to ask if he told her she was coming too and he said no he\u2019d only told her that he was going.\n\nSo I messaged her back and politely said that it\u2019s a family only holiday and I\u2019m sure brother would bring her back a souvenir but unfortunately she won\u2019t be coming with us.\n\nShe started swearing at me and called me a selfish rich c*nt and that she is family and I should be treating her too.\n\nI\u2019ve met her like twice.

It may help him to dodge a bullet", "I can totally see her point of view in that it isn't unreasonable to assume that \"family\" would include her as well. Besides, it could be a good opportunity for you all to get to know her as well. That being said, her reaction does make it seem so that she might not be a person you'd want to get to know.\n\nIn the end, you are the one who gets to decide who to invite with you so NTA. It seems like there has just been some sort of miscommunication between her and your brother.", "NTA. As soon as your brother clarified to you that he hadn't invited her, it was clear that she was either delusional or manipulative. The fact that she swore at you when you let her know it's a family trip makes it clear which one.\n\nThe absolute audacity of this girl to think someone she's met twice is going to foot the bill for her to take a 10-day trip abroad is astounding to me.\n\nIn my high school relationship, BF's mom often seemed to like me more than him, it was a running joke. I was frequently included in \"family\" dinners. But I would not have expected an invitation to their vacation at all, and I never would have tried to insinuate myself like she just did.\n\nI agree with everyone saying you should let your brother know how she just spoke to you. She was out of line with entitlement and he should know how she treats his family.", "NTA It's like you stated, a familly trip. If you brother would have felt she was already part of the familly, he would have maybe asked all of you before if it was ok to bring her along. Her reaction is very immature and I imagine this will greatly impact her relationship with your brother. Different families have different dynamics, thou it might come as a dissapointment for her, to not be included, it was probably nothing personal against her. There were other ways for her to express her disspointment and she deffinitely should have talked to your brother about it first to clear things out. Taking this up to you directly after meeting you just twice seems like a last resort effort on her end to get on the trip since your brother probably turned her down pointing it out that it's just a family trip. But now I can't imagine your brother wanting to be with someone that just lashes out that way towards his sibling to get her way. He really needs to know this. This is not normal behaviour and I see it as a huge red flag.", "Definitely NTA, but you\u2019re leaving off some pretty important details about how this went down. What did your brother say when you told him what she did? I\u2019m just curious, because anyone who invites themselves and expects her boyfriend\u2019s family to pay, for a trip to Paris is an AH.", "NTA, if she has to come she can book and pay her on trip in the same timeframe and maybe ask you to join an activity (on her own dime oc). Expecting you to pay for her is just entitled and rude.", "NTA. Was she expecting you to buy her plane tickets too? She wasn't invited and after her rude behavior, chances are she never will be.", "NTA - She is firmly NOT family. They are not married. If your bro wants her to come, he can pay.", "NTA send your brother those screenshots though. I\u2019m sure he made it perfectly clear. She\u2019s trying to weasel her way in and expect you to pick up the tab.", "NTA for sure\n\nIf anyone calls you a rich cunt after like 2 meetings (without much connection), its just the person being insensitive\n\nbut shouldve told the brother beforehand?", "NTA and the way she reacted makes it even more obvious that she is. Make sure to share that with your brother. He should definitely break up with her.", "18 months? She is part of your brother's family now. I don't think you should necessarily have to pay 100% for her, but not including her is rough. But she swore at you? ESH.", "Well she just sounds lovely. NTA and hope your brother gets her panties out of his eyes and sees her for the nasty person she sounds like.", "1. If you had the resources to pay for her and/or if she had the resources to pay for herself then **YTA**. This is a long-term relationship and I would consider her family at that point. \n\n2. After the girlfriend's nasty response: **NTA**. This person is clearly immature, rude, and doesn't handle rejection well. Although I understand her hurt and frustration, that was uncalled for. \n\nI think everyone has something to own up to on this one.", "Omg she is a red flag?!!!! Did you told your family what she said?!!! I wouldn\u2019t speak to her again.. that\u2019s terrible NTA", "NTA. They're not married, and she is not family. You don't even know her. You're paying. Also, your brother is 18 (and I assume she's a similar age), and it's very reasonable for you to take that into consideration even if you might otherwise include an adult's SO who isn't a spouse.\n\nIf you were even considering it because \"she is with\" your brother, her behavior here puts that at a FIRM no. Your trip, invite people you want there.\n\nForward her last response to your brother. That may solve the whole thing. (Even if your brother lied to you and DID tell her she was going, her beef is with him and her name-calling at you is unacceptable.)", "NTA- she just wanted paid trip.", "NTA. She invited herself then was extremely abusive when told that she wasn't invited. If she's hoping for a future invitation, she's probably going to be disappointed.", "NTA. She isn't \"family\", she's the teenage girlfriend of your teenage brother. If she wants to tag along, she could ask her parents to pay for it. Her reaction to being politely told she misunderstood the situation tells you everything. She won't be in the picture for long, if your brother has half a brain.", "NTA I hope your brother leaves her in the dust", "NTA but screenshot her texts and send them to Ur brother nice gold digger he's got there he deserves to know", "NTA Seems she was trying to pressure you into taking her with the early thank you - she knew she wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nI hope she doesn\u2019t because part of the family. That\u2019s some heavy entitlement.", "NTA.\n\nShe just assumed she was invited when she\u2019s not really family. \nYou should maybe have asked your brother to tell her and you stay out of it.\n\nEither way - I think your brother would benefit from dumping her as she sounds entitled and high maintenance.", "NTA. Shes entitled and by swearing and calling you names just show her personality.", "NTA. She wasn't invited. \n\n>She started swearing at me and called me a selfish rich c*nt and that she is family and I should be treating her too.\n\nImagine how fun she would be on the trip. I bet she believes families get shopping sprees, too.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA, if you\u2019ve only met her twice, I can understand not inviting her. And I can especially understand standing firm in that decision after she lashed out like that.", "Nta, sounds like she knew already and was trying to squeeze herself into those plans.", "NTA but please show your brother what kind of girl he\u2019s dating. Even if they get married I honestly would never pay for her based on how she acted", "NTA. She sounds very entitled and unpleasant. I hope you've shown your brother her messages as her behaviour is entirely unacceptable.", "NTA, and I would show screenshots of her messages to your family (maybe your brother first).", "NTA and I would be definitely letting your brother see the messages she sent you.", "I think her reaction alone proves you're NTA. She is acting very entitled & why would you want to reward that? Don't lose any sleep over this. She just wanted a free trip.", "Nta she expect you to pay for her?

NTA", "NTA", "Don't agree with this. I don't care who pays, she isn't invited. I would not even make that offer. It is a family trip, and she is a teenage gf. No one wants her around nor would esp given her attitude.", "Sure, 18 months feels like a long time to a bunch of 18 year olds. But this is OPs money and OP can spend it however they want because it\u2019s a family event and they don\u2019t know the bro\u2019s bf well enough. And calling someone a vulgar insult doesn\u2019t help the case. NTA imo", "No. 18 months is not part of her brother\u2019s family. At all. She\u2019s his high school gf and will become that girl he dated in high school.", "I think 18 months\u2026they\u2019re still in school but I know they got together in the previous academic year\n\nJust feels weird to me to claim you\u2019re part of someone else\u2019s family when you\u2019re still kids in school applying for uni?", "Even if he has the resources she\u2019s not his responsibility. If anything it\u2019s the boyfriends responsibility to pay for her trip not the brother whom she\u2019s met twice , maybe", "Brother is 18. This isn\u2019t a long-term relationship in the same way an 18 month relationship of 30 year olds would be. Additionally, OP can spend their money as they wish, regardless of how much they have. If brother really wanted GF to come (which it seems he didn\u2019t even bring up when asked, so\u2026) he could pay. NTA", "Abusive is a bit of an overstatement. She was very rude, yes, but let\u2019s not use strong words like that when it\u2019s not the case.", "Frankly, brother should have said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d when OP called him and that should have been the end of it, so he\u2019s a bit of an AH for letting OP do his dirty work. NTA.", "I didn\u2019t think of that but you may be onto something \n\nHusband and I are settled and I like to treat my parents and brother since we were struggling when I was a kid and I like to be able to gift them nice things now\u2026.and little bro and I were talking about doing some shopping", "Also, the O.P. should carefully tell his brother what she said to him, starting from how he politely phrased it.", "I'm in my 40s, and 18 months seems to me like a long enough time for a relationship to be considered in trip planning. If this girl was a kind and polite person, would you feel differently?", "Very quickly too if the brother has any common sense. Maybe his next GF will become part of the family", "It doesn\u2019t matter how long they have dated since it\u2019s a family event. NTA", "If she was truly a big part of the family, one of your parents *might* have asked if she could be included. That\u2019s how it\u2019s usually done- definitely not like this!", "I honestly think any relationship that lasts 18 months can't be dismissed that easily. She obviously should have been polite to you, I'm not saying she's a great person. But if I am dating someone for 18 months, I consider them part of my family.", "I agree, only if she could pay for herself, I think the brother, in case he also thought of her as familly, he could have asked everyone if it was ok to take her too on the trip. But he never proposed this so he was either ok with the idea of leaving without his gf for the trip or she can't afford it and it's obviously he wouldn't dare to ask you to pay for her too. Her anger is directed to OP because I'm asuming she can't afford it and is bummed out her relationship is not seen as serious enough to be considered family and for you to pay for her. But from being bummed out to lashing out and swearing, is a long road flanked with a ton of red flags.", "And fair enough: it wouldn't be her responsibility, even if OP is loaded. But at a certain point, if you're resourceful enough, and something like this is akin to paying for a cup of coffee, then it's pretty dickish. \n\nThis is all very hypothetical. I just wanted to account for as many possibilities as I could. We don't know what OP's bank account looks like. Which is why I included the possibility of the girlfriend paying for herself, which could have been possible. We don't have that information.", "The first definition of the word \"abusive\" is: Extremely offensive and insulting. \n\nPretty sure that fits.", "Who the heck invites themselves to a Paris vacation? And swearing at you and calling you names?  I'm amazed by the audacity of this 18 years old.\n\nShe's showing you who she is.  Tell your brother to believe her.", "NTA- I would have a heart to heart with your brother about how you are not a atm and from this moment on you will not be invite any of his GF on any trip until they are engaged.", "Haha. If the brother is as protective and family oriented as O.P. seems to be, the nuclear option is to take a screenshot and send it to the brother. Saying eill you let your gf know I won't be talked to like this. They may not still be together in April", "Would I feel differently? Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t because at the end of the day, it\u2019s OP\u2019s money and they get to decide how it\u2019s used.", "I'm late 30s and I wouldn't be paying for a siblings girlfriend/boyfriend, even if it was 5 years. OP determined who they were inviting. Someone either misunderstood or assumed they would be invited. Instead of graciously accepting the error, the gf chose to act like a spoilt brat.\n\nIf you have that kind of money to throw about, that's your choice but I stand by OP as NTA", "Again it\u2019s at most 18 months since the earliest they could\u2019ve been together was September 2021. I used the number as a stand in because I don\u2019t actually know when they exactly started dating.\n\nI appreciate your point and that\u2019s fair if that\u2019s your take, but honestly if I walked past my HS boyfriend on the street now I wouldn\u2019t recognise him and we were together for years", "If this is EXTREMELY abusive, what would you call getting a slap in the face?", "This, OP, this.  Screenshot this and send to him - speaking to you in this way is profoundly revealing about the GF's character, and you can't suggest it but someone who would act like this is someone your brother should be miles away from.", "Wow, really? Damn. Maybe I'm just a sentimental person. \n\nI guess what we don't know here is your brother's opinion. Does he want her to join you? Or is he completely fine with her not coming along?", "I\u2019m not saying what that girl did is okay in any kind of way btw", "He never mentioned her joining\n\nWhen I asked him if he\u2019d invited her he said \u201cno. obviously not, I said we are going but didn\u2019t include [gf\u2019s name] in that\u201d", "Alright, so maybe she's not that important to him. I retract my ESH, you're NTA."]}
