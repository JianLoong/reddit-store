It may help him to dodge a bullet", "I can totally see her point of view in that it isn't unreasonable to assume that \"family\" would include her as well. Besides, it could be a good opportunity for you all to get to know her as well. That being said, her reaction does make it seem so that she might not be a person you'd want to get to know.\n\nIn the end, you are the one who gets to decide who to invite with you so NTA. It seems like there has just been some sort of miscommunication between her and your brother.", "NTA. As soon as your brother clarified to you that he hadn't invited her, it was clear that she was either delusional or manipulative. The fact that she swore at you when you let her know it's a family trip makes it clear which one.\n\nThe absolute audacity of this girl to think someone she's met twice is going to foot the bill for her to take a 10-day trip abroad is astounding to me.\n\nIn my high school relationship, BF's mom often seemed to like me more than him, it was a running joke. I was frequently included in \"family\" dinners. But I would not have expected an invitation to their vacation at all, and I never would have tried to insinuate myself like she just did.\n\nI agree with everyone saying you should let your brother know how she just spoke to you. She was out of line with entitlement and he should know how she treats his family.", "NTA It's like you stated, a familly trip. If you brother would have felt she was already part of the familly, he would have maybe asked all of you before if it was ok to bring her along. Her reaction is very immature and I imagine this will greatly impact her relationship with your brother. Different families have different dynamics, thou it might come as a dissapointment for her, to not be included, it was probably nothing personal against her. There were other ways for her to express her disspointment and she deffinitely should have talked to your brother about it first to clear things out. Taking this up to you directly after meeting you just twice seems like a last resort effort on her end to get on the trip since your brother probably turned her down pointing it out that it's just a family trip. But now I can't imagine your brother wanting to be with someone that just lashes out that way towards his sibling to get her way. He really needs to know this. This is not normal behaviour and I see it as a huge red flag.", "Definitely NTA, but you\u2019re leaving off some pretty important details about how this went down. What did your brother say when you told him what she did? I\u2019m just curious, because anyone who invites themselves and expects her boyfriend\u2019s family to pay, for a trip to Paris is an AH.", "NTA, if she has to come she can book and pay her on trip in the same timeframe and maybe ask you to join an activity (on her own dime oc). Expecting you to pay for her is just entitled and rude.", "NTA. Was she expecting you to buy her plane tickets too? She wasn't invited and after her rude behavior, chances are she never will be.", "NTA - She is firmly NOT family. They are not married. If your bro wants her to come, he can pay.", "NTA send your brother those screenshots though. I\u2019m sure he made it perfectly clear. She\u2019s trying to weasel her way in and expect you to pick up the tab.", "NTA for sure\n\nIf anyone calls you a rich cunt after like 2 meetings (without much connection), its just the person being insensitive\n\nbut shouldve told the brother beforehand?", "NTA and the way she reacted makes it even more obvious that she is. Make sure to share that with your brother. He should definitely break up with her.", "18 months? She is part of your brother's family now. I don't think you should necessarily have to pay 100% for her, but not including her is rough. But she swore at you? ESH.", "Well she just sounds lovely. NTA and hope your brother gets her panties out of his eyes and sees her for the nasty person she sounds like.", "1. If you had the resources to pay for her and/or if she had the resources to pay for herself then **YTA**. This is a long-term relationship and I would consider her family at that point. \n\n2. After the girlfriend's nasty response: **NTA**. This person is clearly immature, rude, and doesn't handle rejection well.

Did you told your family what she said?!!! I wouldn\u2019t speak to her again.. that\u2019s terrible NTA", "NTA. They're not married, and she is not family. You don't even know her. You're paying. Also, your brother is 18 (and I assume she's a similar age), and it's very reasonable for you to take that into consideration even if you might otherwise include an adult's SO who isn't a spouse.\n\nIf you were even considering it because \"she is with\" your brother, her behavior here puts that at a FIRM no. Your trip, invite people you want there.\n\nForward her last response to your brother. That may solve the whole thing. (Even if your brother lied to you and DID tell her she was going, her beef is with him and her name-calling at you is unacceptable.)", "NTA- she just wanted paid trip.", "NTA. She invited herself then was extremely abusive when told that she wasn't invited. If she's hoping for a future invitation, she's probably going to be disappointed.", "NTA. She isn't \"family\", she's the teenage girlfriend of your teenage brother. If she wants to tag along, she could ask her parents to pay for it. Her reaction to being politely told she misunderstood the situation tells you everything. She won't be in the picture for long, if your brother has half a brain.", "NTA I hope your brother leaves her in the dust", "NTA but screenshot her texts and send them to Ur brother nice gold digger he's got there he deserves to know", "NTA Seems she was trying to pressure you into taking her with the early thank you - she knew she wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nI hope she doesn\u2019t become part of the family. That\u2019s some heavy entitlement.", "NTA.\n\nShe just assumed she was invited when she\u2019s not really family. \nYou should maybe have asked your brother to tell her and you stay out of it.\n\nEither way - I think your brother would benefit from dumping her as she sounds entitled and high maintenance.", "NTA.

She wasn't invited. \n\n>She started swearing at me and called me a selfish rich c*nt and that she is family and I should be treating her too.\n\nImagine how fun she would be on the trip. I bet she believes families get shopping sprees, too.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA, if you\u2019ve only met her twice, I can understand not inviting her. And I can especially understand standing firm in that decision after she lashed out like that.", "Nta, sounds like she knew already and was trying to squeeze herself into those plans.", "NTA but please show your brother what kind of girl he\u2019s dating. Even if they get married I honestly would never pay for her based on how she acted", "NTA. She sounds very entitled and unpleasant. I hope you've shown your brother her messages as her behaviour is entirely unacceptable.", "NTA, and I would show screenshots of her messages to your family (maybe your brother first).", "NTA and I would be definitely letting your brother see the messages she sent you.", "I think her reaction alone proves you're NTA.

I don't think the girlfriend is quite as out of line as most people are saying and I think you're being insensitive to her feelings. Let's look at this from her perspective. Her boyfriend of a year-and-a-half is going to Paris, one of the most romantic cities in the world, for a vacation. Without her. And your response is \"we'll bring you back a souvenir\". I don't think it's hard to see why this would upset her, which is why I think you're partly the AH here.\n\nBut she's not handling it in the most mature way either so she definitely gets a share of the AH judgement. I'm assuming she's around the same age as your brother, which would make her 18 or thereabouts. Contrary to what she probably thinks, she's still basically a kid when it comes to emotional maturity and so is your brother. She can't be expected to handle this the same way that a 30+ adult would. That doesn't give her a free pass but in my mind, that doesn't necessarily mean she's instantly unworthy of your brother. It just means she's still got some growing up to do. \n\nAnd she's not entirely wrong about wanting to be included in the family. They've been together long enough that this isn't just a fling. Probably still too early for them to be thinking about marriage, but they're probably at least thinking about this as a long-term relationship. It's not unreasonable for her to want to be included in the family, especially if she's barely met any of you.\n\nThat said, I do think she's pushing this point harder because it's Paris and she really wants to go. Who wouldn't? So I say cut her some slack. Let her know that you understand her perspective but don't appreciate her tone. Then perhaps consider letting her come along if she can pay her own way. Your post doesn't explicitly state who's paying for each member of the family but it sounds like you are. If that's the case, you shouldn't be responsible for paying for her as well. But you also shouldn't be blocking her from coming either. Leave that decision to your brother.

If a little older, I would say she should certain have been invited. I've also had major confusions about this type of thing as and between young people when they are nonspecific with language, like saying \"we're going to Paris\", not \"my family is going to Paris\".

I'd give your brother a heads up in case she tries to twist him up before the trip.", "NTA tell your brother and show him the messages", "Who invites themselves on a vacation? NTA.\n\nThe fact that she started swearing at you and calling you names when she found out she wasn\u2019t invited is all you should need to know to be sure that you made the right choice. \n\nWould it have been nice to invite her? Absolutely. They\u2019ve been together for almost 2 years and I feel like it would be appropriate, but does she deserve to go? Absolutely not. So be glad you didn\u2019t invite her. I think that if your brother had asked you when the trip was being planned if she could come, things would be different. The fact that he didn\u2019t want to invite her also speaks volumes.", "You are not TA.  Even if they were married, it would be very presumptuous to assume you would be paying for her.  Just bc you plan a family vacation, doesn't mean you have the funds to cover everyone.  Sometimes, group arrangements are made for the discounts, but everyone chips in for their share..  I've never heard of such entitlement..", "Yeah.  Who\u2019s actually the selfish one here?  Most likely the 18 year old girl flipping out because she\u2019s not getting a free vacation.", "Genuinely baffled as to why the girlfriend thinks that using language like that towards the OP will get the girlfriend what she wants.\n\nNTA", "Exactly! And I was thinking with that response, if I'd been on the fence earlier, that would have sealed a hard NO. That's just the kind of drama you don't want on a family trip.", "What blows my mind is, this 18 year old girl probably lives with her mom and dad. You\u2019d think there would be coordination with the parents with regards to a trip to Paris lmao.", "This is a family trip. She is not family so she is not invited end of discussion what is wrong with people ?", "I hope you sent screenshots of those texts to your brother.  He should know that he is dating a gold-digger that treats his family like crap.\n\nNTA", "please show your brother her response. it is so deranged that she thinks there can be any positive relationship long-term with your family after sending that text message. if someone talked to my brother or sister with such disrespect like that, i would break up with them immediately. your brother should be aware of the entitled monster he's involved with.", "I would definitely  show brother the messages", "How long have they been dating that she expects an obligatory invite to a family vacation abroad to the point of vulgarly voicing personal offense otherwise?\n\nYour brother needs to see the screenshots of her messages. Explain to him that she is showing a very poor face to your family, and that this does not bode well for their future relationship. Make sure he knows you aren\u2019t trying to sway him into taking any actions, but that you are concerned for his well-being as you do not feel comfortable around someone who has the audactity to speak to you, a virtual stranger, like that. You are her (best-case) future in-law. She should be on her best behavior with you. If she treats you like this while on her *best bahavior* how is she treating your brother?!", "She thinks only rich people move abroad", "NTA. if she is able to afford her own ticket and your brother wants her then it is a bit different. if she expect you to pay for her i would say heck nah also i would have a talk with your brother... is this really the girl he would like to be with?", "NTA, \n\nMy money is on that she has hung onto your brother this long because she thought she was going to Paris. Now she is p\\_\\_\\_ed that she wasted her time.", "He\u2019s 18 years old, and they\u2019d been dating 1.5 years. While I wouldn\u2019t judge someone for including the gf, it is most definitely not an expectation to include her. She\u2019s not family. At that age, relationships can easily last a couple years without ever moving towards a life together because you\u2019re young. If you\u2019ve been together 5 years by then or you\u2019ve indicated marriage may be in the cards soon-ish maybe include them. But you don\u2019t have any need to take a barely out of high school (at the oldest) kid\u2019s gf on a family vacation.", "Where are you getting that from m? You're just making up assumptions.", "I don't see why? My parents have gone on a lot of international family trips where even as adults my brother and myself were invited along. His gf (now wife) got invited to one of them -- once. Otherwise they weren't SO-inclusive. Trips like that are expensive, by default a SO who isn't married isn't invited, and if you're mature enough to get married you're mature enough to pay for your own plane tickets.\n\nI haven't been on  the other end of things with an SO whose family was going on a trip like that, but if I was I wouldn't assume I was invited.\n\n(Plus these things have to be planned way, way in advance -- far enough in advance that it's very risky assuming an 18 year old and his girlfriend are still going to be together from the time you spend the money to the time you actually go.)", "This!", "Some languages have separate words for \"us\" as in \"us as a group including you\" and \"us as a group but not you\" and \"us as in just me and you\". Would clear up any ambiguity!", "I was always stoked when my friends brought me souvenirs from their trips to foreign places. If she is insulted by getting a gift from a foreign country, she wouldn\u2019t have appreciated the trip anyways.", "This is the same level of my brothers wife. Before she married him, she asked my mom what she would do with all her jewelry.", " And that's the thing, calling her names and swearing at her, is not gonna win her any brownie points. It sure isn't gonna make OP go, you know what? I'm gonna go ahead and invite her she seems really sweet.", "Yeah. I can't imagine 18 year old me thinking I'd be invited by my GF's sibling on their family vacation. And if I was, I'd assume I'd be footing my own bill for travel, food, lodgings, etc.", "She showed OP she is 18.", "It's just a couple of train rides away. Almost close enough for a daytrip.", ">Who the heck invites themselves to a Paris vacation?\n\nBig difference if they're in the UK versus anywhere else in the Anglosphere. Still NTA, though", "18 years old. despite their protestations for the most part they aren't completely grown up. \n\nhowever, when they have a baby they are automatically mature adults", "It's usually because it has worked int he past so it's their go to as problem solver. What OP need to know is how she has been treating the brother. Most 18 years old will put up with abuses because they're \"expected\" to or just because they haven't had relationship experience before.", "Yep- cause this trash is seeing herself out.", "It\u2019s a weird coming of age grey area, hell everything is weird at that age.", "The moment OP got a message that she was excited for the trip. A text exchange with the brother, that\u2019s all that\u2019s written. I think the possibility of the brother saying one thing to the girlfriend without all the facts and or assuming is much greater than the girl friend going out of her way to ask a question that would have embarrassing consequences without previous word from the boyfriend. Additionally, given the alarming behavior that followed, either she is a simply unbalanced human OR she was emotional from being let down and going off of either intentionally wrong, or unknowingly wrong information from the brother/bf. She is still the asshole regardless that much is not in question, but being super upset after learning you aren\u2019t actually going to Paris might be her catalyst.", "Please send an update too. Good luck.", "Tbh... THAT is weird not to assume you would he joining your SPOUSE", "More like a foul mouthed toddler.", "And the first post in this thread says: \"... then was extremely abusive...\". \n\n\n\nWho can't read?", "I wondered that. I could see \u2018we\u2019re going on a family trip\u2019, \u2018my sister\u2019s paying to take us to Paris\u2019 -\u2018when is it\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Paris\u2019 to get them talking at cross purposes and not realising. \n\nStill NTA and gf is very rude and entitled.", "Same, I'm British and thought the C word was THE worst swear\n\nDont think my mum would think it was funny.", "US here.  It's really the worst IMP.", "maybe its just a difference in the areas im thinking of (which is mostly yorkshire, merseyside, nottingham, and aberdeen) but i definitely hear it used freely in the UK. \n\nif someone called me a c*nt, sure id be offended, but id be just as offended if they called me a mf\u2019er or a b!tch or something. \n\nthe word doesnt make it *more* offensive, even if it is still offensive", "Apparently you lmao. I never said it didn't say that.", "Agreed. I've used it on the occasion when I'm literally making sure that I never have to deal with the women afterward while ending toxic friendships. However I must have antibodies or something because it doesn't phase me in the slightest to be called it, especially when I'm being one.", "I understand why it isn't as sensitive for men, but for many women it's so reductive an insult, telling them that they aren't anything more than a sex hole.  One dimensional.  Usually combined with the word \"stupid\". Women have been dismissed in that way for millennia.  It's not something I could shrug off.", "Yeah it just never bothered me.  I guess it's more along the lines of because it gets a rise out of many women, my brain just has to be defiant and not feel insulted. But to be fair, anyone that's actually reducing themselves to name-calling never bothered me either.  I think it's more enjoyable when they say it and I have no more of a reaction as if they called me a pee pee head it's more frustrating to them than me.\n\nBut I also grew up being a gamer so I'm just desensitized. I better go see if I have a pulse.", "It\u2019s the same generation that works somewhere for 2 months then expects to be promoted. GF is 18 years old and has been dating brother for 18 months.

GF is never invited. Ever.\n\nOP is NTA!", "I wonder if the brother gave the number to the gf and told her to message the sister so she felt obligated to pay for her as well. I have a gym hard time believing an 18 yo would think she was going.", "A redneck.", "I don't get why this was bad? When I was 18 one is my best friend went to Paris and she brought me back souvenirs. I'm 33 and still have them", "How odd. I would think \"hey this is a family vaca but we will bring you a back a souvenir\" can't be twisted like this, but I guess you can read into anything. What is OP just said no without explanation? That sounds rude too. Souvenir/gift is generally considered nice- the shitty part is a perspective issue. Imagine over-thinking this convo to make sure you have the most tact possible for a passing issue like this...especially for someone so tactless in return lol.", "She might spend a lot of time with OP\u2019s family but she\u2019s not OP\u2019s family. OP only met her a couple of times and this trip is not the time or place for OP to get to know brother\u2019s gf."]}
