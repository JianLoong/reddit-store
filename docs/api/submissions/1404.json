A lot of those groups and people I only see during one class a day this being PE. \n\nAnd my girlfriend happens to be one of the people that I only see once day. Simply because we go to school that has two different languages and I am in a different language where as she is just in french. So no classes together, it is usually wouldn\u2019t be a problem because we see each other in the hallways and I go after school to hang with her. \n\nNow for the main problem. I\u2019ve been trying to get a job recently, and because of the time our school ends I would have to go from school to my house and then straight to work afterwards and then stay at work till closing. \n\nAnd my girlfriend has been pretty upset about this, she\u2019s suggesting that I decide not to work and I should just quit trying to find a job. Lots of people are coming in telling me that she is right and I should stop trying to find a job and spend more time with her. The thing is I don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m trying to get a job that I would really really enjoy doing and I would really want. \n\nmy girlfriend told me that I had to choose her or getting a job, and well I chose the job. It just makes more sense for me, our relationship isn\u2019t exactly working out anyways so I simply chose the job over her. Apparently she didn\u2019t think I would actually do that, so she\u2019s been apologizing to me but not really. \n\nShe\u2019s been saying things like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I suggested that, it was rude of me because I know how much you want this job, but I still think it\u2019ll be better if you decide not to take it and focus more on me instead\u201d I always get annoyed when she says things like this so I said no and now she\u2019s blowing up my phone being mad at me because apparently she gave me a very hearty apology and I am being cruel. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole in the situation, she\u2019s saying things like \u201cif you really love me you wouldn\u2019t take this job\u201d so I don\u2019t really think, I don\u2019t think that I am required to spend 100% of my time with her and think that it\u2019s my choice because it\u2019s my life. \n\nBut so many people have said that I\u2019m in the wrong here but I don\u2019t know. And the last thing is that she also doesn\u2019t spend 100% of her time with me. Like I\u2019ll ask her to hang out and she saids that she doesn\u2019t feel like it? I just don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s fair so I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAm I that asshole Reddit?\n\n(I tried to separate the big paragraph into smaller ones so it was easier to read, so please ignore how it just cuts off)", "created_utc": 1667608721, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymfevj/aita_for_trying_to_get_a_job/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
