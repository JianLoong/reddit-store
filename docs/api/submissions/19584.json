I can't help but wonder if I made a huge mistake, so I'm turning to you, Reddit, to pass judgment on whether or not I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\nSince my wife's passing, life has been tough for the both of us. Dealing with my own grief while trying to provide for her has been a challenge. My daughter has been extremely, extremely distraught; and I can see how much she's struggling emotionally. However, when she asked me for time off from school to process her grief, I ended up prioritizing her academic performance instead.\n\nI'll admit, I've always been a stickler for education, and my daughter is a bright student who excels in her studies (particularly math and science, which are very important and I wouldn\u2019t want to jeopardize that). When she approached me, I couldn't help but think about how it would impact her grades and future prospects. I was concerned that missing school would lead to a drop in her academic performance and potentially hinder her chances of getting into a good college.\n\nInstead of allowing her to take some time off, I suggested that she continue attending school and told her that I believed that maintaining a routine and focusing on her education would provide stability and keep her on track.\n\nApparently, my daughter was devastated by my decision. She accused me of not caring about her feelings and prioritizing her school performance over her emotional well-being. She believes that I'm being callous and unfeeling, dismissing her need for \u201ctime to heal\u201d.\n\nSoooo, Reddit, am I the asshole for putting my daughter's school performance ahead of her \u201cemotional well-being\u201d (as she put it) after the death of her mother? I'm genuinely questioning if I made the right decision and would appreciate your honest opinions.

You even mentioned that you are still processing what happened and haven't completely come to terms with it. How can you even expect your daughter to do what haven't yet been able to?", "YTA. She needed time to grieve. A couple weeks out of school won't ruin her academic results. \n\nI know this is hard and I am sorry for your loss, but you need to stop being lazy. Get her teachers involved and make sure she can take the rest she deserves while staying on track with school. \n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "YTA. Massive AH move. You absolutely\u00a0should have given your daughter time off from school to process her grief. I know your wife died, but your daughter is a child and her mother died! If she's a great student, all the more reason to know that a break won't ruin her future! Have a heart man", "Two weeks off is probably something she could do (and pretty warranted) after such a momentous loss. And even after that, there are ways to discuss the loss with the school/teachers and find accommodations. It is true that routine can be helpful in some ways for some people after a loss, and I think you are grieving and probably unaware of the possibilities for 504 plans, etc, so I won't call you the AH, but there is no reason your achieving daughter would not do fine even if she took off school. And mental health > grades anyway. N A H\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just saw from the comments that your daughter wanted three weeks off. This is TOTALLY REASONABLE and you were wrong to deny it.

Changing my vote to YTA", "\nYour child has just had the worst trauma of her life. She will never be the same.

Setting aside your, frankly, cruel disregard of her mental health, your approach is completely counterproductive from an educational standpoint.  If she is continuing to attend school uninterrupted, her teachers will expect her meet the regular deadlines for papers and tests, even though she is not in a headspace to perform.  If you let her take some time off to grieve, she likely would extensions to complete her work that would ultimately benefit her education.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get your head out of your ass and start parenting your child.", "YTA you need to give her the opportunity to make her own decisions when it comes to this.

I\u2019m a retired cop, so I was able to process it better. DD(15), needed time, & counseling. She took off March, April, & May, & the school sent work home, & she zoomed a few classes.

The first day of classes for my senior year was the day of her funeral. My brother, who I went to live with after my mom died, thought just like you.  I was an honors student, very involved in numerous extracurricular activities.  Within a month, I had shut down. I mean, I literally had a breakdown while reading the morning announcements over the school's intercom. Had to be taken out of school  for the rest of the semester.  My grades suffered, and I suffered.  Let your daughter grieve, let her set the pace for her healing.  You can't force this on her. She will shut down, and she will never forgive you.\n\nEdited to clarify wording. Went to live with my brother because our dad had died several years earlier, so he was the sibling my mom picked for me to live with after she passed.", "YTA\n\nI don't know what level of academic performance you think your daughter is going to be having while emotionally distraught at school. Do you think her grades are going to be upkept while she sits in her math class thinking about how she doesn't have a mother?

Do you think her study time is going to be used effectively while she's emotionally and mentally crippled?\n\nDo you think she's going to look at you one day and say, 'you know what dad, I'm so glad you made me go to school while I was still dealing with the absolutely mind and body crushing grief of loosing my mother. I'm so glad I never got the chance to full grieve becuase I had to focus on my schooling. But hey, I got a 87% in English so all good.'\n\nOr do you think she's going to look at her father and know in her heart that he prioritised her being high achiever over her emotional well-being, over her spiritual well-being, and over her own mental health and she's going to look at you know she prehaps lost the parent who genuinely cared about her.", "YTA.\n\nShe lost her MOTHER TWO WEEKS AGO. She deserves to have that time off! It's not like she's bullshitting for no reason. She at 16 has to cope with the fact that her mother won't be their to help her get ready for prom, graduation, college formals or graduation that she won't be their for her one day wedding or if she has kids the births. She's struggling with the fact her mother is GONE. You can get remarried, she can't get another mother. \n\nYou think her taking a week or two from school is going to damage her that much?!? Teachers can easily give her some work packets to complete over the time off! She won't lose that many grade points and she'll prolly do BETTER with time off.\n\nYour daughter LOST HER MOTHER. At SIXTEEN. And you're more worried about some grades? How about this. \n\nGet your daughter into therapy and grief counseling.\nYou get into therapy as well.\nYou get into family counseling cause you just threw a missile into your relationship with your kid fyi.\nGive her the time off she needs.\nAnd remember the fact that the grief truly hasn't hit your daughter yet. And that when it does she's going to need emotional support and actual support. She's going to face depression and if you think her grades are bad now? If she doesn't have a GOOD support system her grades will be non-existent. And chances are shes plotting no contact as soon as she can for how callous you are being towards her. She lost her mother. She's 16. Think that through. You lost a wife she lost a mother. She now has hundreds of milestones she's gonna go thru without her mother. She needs support.\n\nTake your head outta where it is and look at it from HER point of view. She can make up the grades she can't stop the grief from taking her down. Also fyi if you've proven to her in her eyes you are a unsafe/non-support person then if the depression goes to far you won't be the person she turns to when things get dark. \n\nI pray to the goddesses she doesn't fall down that rabbit hole of darkness but often when teens lose their parent they fall into deep depression which can lead to suicidal thoughts and at the worst part actions.\n\nSo don't just try make sure she gets a therapist and a support system also apologize for putting school above her health and healing from the immense grief she's going through.\n\nAlso fyi the reason I know how she feels so well is because I was 15 when my mother died. I'm 29 and till not okay. I put education above my mental health and emotional well-being and I'm now a college drop out working as a housekeeper living at home with my father.

My brother actually ended up catching COVID during his sophomore year of college.

I am shouting this. My mother passed away at 16 also. A month before my 17th birthday. Something like that is very traumatic especially at that age. I seen her the day before after I got home from school. And she was on the couch like she always was just falling asleep. (She had a problem with pain pills.) she had 9 knee surgeries, a neck surgery, stomach surgery, and a neck surgery. She had just had her 2nd back surgery earlier in the year in 2013. Then by July , my dad paid $10,000 to a rehab plantation to help her take medicine the correct way and not be addicted to them. (She still needed her medicine especially after the amount of surgeries she had and her back just being done) she came back everything was great. Until this one day. When I came in I said hello and everything and she did speak back but she was just acting like she use to. So I already knew what was going on so I went to my room. Then asked dad if I could spend the night at my friends house and we go to school the next morning. He said yes, and her dad said yes so I packed up my stuff. When I came back upstairs, she wasn\u2019t on the couch anymore  and I didn\u2019t even bother going into their room because she was probably already passed out asleep or whatever. So I didn\u2019t even tell her bye or I love you . I just walked out the door. The whole time I was at my friends, I just had a weird feeling something wasn\u2019t right. I didn\u2019t even sleep that night either , maybe 3-4 hours if that, it was 2-3am before I fell asleep. Something was keeping me up and I just wasn\u2019t comfortable. Well, we get up the next morning and getting ready it was like 6-6:15am and I was so sleepy, I called my dad and asked if he could meet me at the school to bring me some homefries is what it was called from the little store/restaurant down the road from the school for breakfast. He said he would. Not even 10 minutes later my dad is calling me and told me I needed to come home something is wrong with mom. I asked what\u2019s wrong is she ok? And he said I don\u2019t know you just need to get home. And I asked again what was wrong and then he shouted she wasn\u2019t breathing. And I told him we were on the way and her dad dropped me off at home. When I got there, my dad was in the kitchen and he came to me before I started looking for her and then he told me that mom has passed away. I started yelling at him because he didn\u2019t even call the 911 yet he was waiting on me to get there. He kept yelling at me to stop yelling at him because he didn\u2019t know what to do he\u2019s been doing cpr the whole time and trying to get her to wake up  but she was cold ..and I ended up calling 911. My dad was a train wreck and in shock and I went back there trying to wake her up. But she wouldn\u2019t wake up. She was already cold. And stiff. They came and declared her dead and everything. My dad said she was sleeping good and he slept in the living room last night and checked on her at 3 when he got up and said that she was breathing and snoring  and so he didn\u2019t get in bed he just went back to the living room. I regret not speaking to my mom before walking out the door because I was mad at her for relapsing. I wish I could go back and at least tell her bye and I love you. I stayed out of school the rest of the week. She passed on a Wednesday, and then my dad made me go back to school that Tuesday because he said I needed to get on with my life and can\u2019t just stop going to school. I needed more time to grieve after something like that. I was not the same and it was hard going to school because everyone just kept coming to me and then one class made a huge card for me.

It was genuinely one of the worst days of my entire life, and even though that was 15 years ago. I still can remember the exact way that pain felt. \n\nDo you daughter a favour. Apologise.

Other parents are not so lucky. What do you want, for her to continue with school while she\u2019s unable to process her grief and become depressed, or worse?

It\u2019s a terrible time where emotions run high and rational decision making is not easy. \n\nYour daughter absolutely is not sitting at school being a model student. She has a gaping, still bleeding emotion wound that needs first aid and which is taking up ALL of her attention and she energy. She needs time, space, and safety to stay to even process what her new normal looks like - just like you do. Grieving is exhausting, and painful, and we just cannot take in new information well (if at all) in the immediate aftermath. So even if she is attending school, she\u2019s likely not benefiting from it at all anyway. She\u2019s just being deprived of the time and space she need to grieve. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late to recognise you\u2019ve made a mistake and change your mind. \n\nGive yourself grace here too though.

If you are, or for anyone going through a similar situation, your daughter will have a chance to explain any dips in her grades on her college application. Assuming this is the end of her sophomore year, she has quite a bit of time to right the ship. If it is the end of her junior year, the first three quarters will hopefully show what she is capable of, and she will have two quarters next year to show improvement. Not to mention it's almost the end of the school year, so taking time off may not have much of an effect anyway.", "Therapist here - without adequate opportunity to process her grief, her academics will suffer anyway.

My younger sister had returned to school before the funeral was even held, preferring the support of her school friends I suppose.  Everyone is different.\n\nHowever, if your daughter says she wants time off, I would urge you to listen to her.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (39M) am feeling conflicted about a recent decision I made regarding my teenage daughter (16F) following the death of her mother. I can't help but wonder if I made a huge mistake, so I'm turning to you, Reddit, to pass judgment on whether or not I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\nSince my wife's passing, life has been tough for the both of us. Dealing with my own grief while trying to provide for her has been a challenge. My daughter has been extremely, extremely distraught, and I can see how much she's struggling emotionally. However, when she asked me for time off from school to process her grief, I ended up prioritizing her academic performance instead.\n\nI'll admit, I've always been a stickler for education, and my daughter is a bright student who excels in her studies (particularly math and science, which are very important and I wouldn\u2019t want to jeopardize that). When she approached me, I couldn't help but think about how it would impact her grades and future prospects. I was concerned that missing school would lead to a drop in her academic performance and potentially hinder her chances of getting into a good college.\n\nInstead of allowing her to take some time off, I suggested that she continue attending school and told her that I believed that maintaining a routine and focusing on her education would provide stability and keep her on track.\n\nApparently, my daughter was devastated by my decision. She accused me of not caring about her feelings and prioritizing her school performance over her emotional well-being. She believes that I'm being callous and unfeeling, dismissing her need for \u201ctime to heal\u201d.\n\nSoooo, Reddit, am I the asshole for putting my daughter's school performance ahead of her \u201cemotional well-being\u201d (as she put it) after the death of her mother? I'm genuinely questioning if I made the right decision and would appreciate your honest opinions. Thanks for reading!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If anything will it's the emotional turmoil and lack of time to grieve.", "YTA. \n\nYou are both grieving right now, but neglecting her emotional well being will not help her now or in the long run. She will not be able to engage in her classes at the same level she did before. The school counsellors are overworked and often ill-equipped to deal with this, so don\u2019t expect her to get the help she needs there either. \n\nGiving her time to heal in peace and giving her access to a grief counsellor will help her to get the tools to move forward even as she continues the grieving process.

YTA", "YTA. As someone who had their dad die, it's natural for your daughters grades to slip. My grades didn't slip, BUT only because he died near the Christmas holiday and then we had 2 weeks off.

She will have reduced performance during her grieving period, and that's okay, as long as she does her best.\n\nThe world doesn't stop for grief.  You just have to keep going as best you can.  A good job will give you a week or two of bereavement leave, but after that you stop getting paid.
