Her dad was permenantly out of the picture and her mom (48F) remarried and had two more kids (15M and 13F) with her current husband. Valentina has always been close to me but we got much closer after her mom remarried. She is kind of a lone wolf and I am the only one she was comfortable with.\n\nBefore Valentina went to college, at around age 16, she came to me and opened up about liking girls. It was a very emotional day and she made me swear not to tell her mom. I kept my word, and I said I will let her do this at her own speed, and her own terms. She'd come to me with girlfriend issues and stuff, and we would talk but I never told my sister.\n\nValentina worked really hard and got into one of the best colleges and moved away at 18. We still kept in touch, but understandably less so than when she was home.\n\nShe now works in a different state, at a job I'm proud she has. I recently got to meet her current girlfriend (28F) when I was visiting her. I did not tell my sister this as well. Now since Valentina is kind of serious about her GF, she said she was going to tell her mother soon.\n\nYesterday I got a call from my sister, calling me all kinds of names, an AH included. She said I should have told her about Valentina's sexual orientation before and that I was an AH for doing things behind her back. After the phone call, I started doubting myself.

You supporting her and her sexuality is truly amazing. If Valentina didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling your sister then that speaks to the relationship she has with her mom and her concerns.

You are a good uncle and it\u2019s clear why your niece trusts you. Valentina asked you not to tell her mom, which is totally reasonable. If this were a secret that was harming her - drugs, self harm, abuse, etc - then it might be appropriate to tell her mom, depending on the situation of course. But her sexual orientation? That\u2019s not harming anyone. I think your sister is just feeling hurt that her daughter didn\u2019t trust her with this so she\u2019s taking it out on you. Well done being a supportive, trustworthy person.", "Absolutely NTA. Her mum perhaps needs to examine the reasons why her daughter felt more comfortable talking to you than she was talking to her.\n \nUltimately you made a promise to someone to keep a secret (nothing that was damaging or dangerous to keep) and you would have been breaching their trust to pass it on regardless of the relationship to you of the person you passed it onto.", "NTA, your niece confided in you something that wasn\u2019t life threatening so there\u2019s no need for you to have told your sister.

Your niece confided in you something deeply personal.  The information did not harm your niece, nor did it harm anyone else, so you were right in keeping it to yourself, honoring her confidence, and letting her tell her mother in her own time.

There must be a reason she didn't tell her mum?", "NTA. People come out at their own pace. She obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about this with her mom.

It's not your fault that your niece felt she could not tell her mother about it earlier, but she obviously had some reason for believing she couldn't do so.", "NTA at all.

It's your niece's business, it's not up to you to out her. This isn't a situation of something harmful that happened to her and she is afraid to tell her mom.

I hope that she will feel I am a safe place like your niece feels that you are.", "A promise is a promise. Had Valentina asked to keep the secret about something that would be dangerous or detrimental to her health/life, someone else's health/life, it would have been necessary and urgent to tell the parents. \n\nBut when it comes to other stuff (any really), it's up to the child to inform the parent when the child is ready. The information is not owed to the parent just because they are the parent. If the child is not ready, then the parent should not know. \n\nPlus : it is crucial for children and teenagers to have a grown up in their lives to whom they can talk about anything, without fear of being ratted. At least, one person who cares about them knows that there is nothing dangerous going in the child/teenager's life. It's way better than children and teenagers keeping EVERYTHING to themselves out of fear the info will reach their parents before they want to.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you never ever out anyone if you're not asked by that person to do so.", "NTA. you had her trust and you kept her trust. When it comes to kids I think it's important to tell parents the secrets that could potentially be dangerous to the child, but her sexuality isn't putting her at any risk. \n\nLet your sister cool off and if you feel it would be appropriate speak to her when she is in a better frame of mind and let her know you knew it wasn't your place to tell her", "NTA. You were the safe place she needed.", "NTA. It was not your secret to tell. Good on you.", "NTA, not one bit. Your niece needed someone to trust, and you were that person. Your sister may be upset that her daughter trusted you more than her, but that's her own issue to fix.  Plus, it wasn't your information to share, it's your niece's.  She absolutely should be the only one to decide with who and when she wants to come out.  Since you've proven she can trust you, she'll likely continue to come to you when she needs support so please don't question your decision to protect her secret.  Based on her mom's reaction, it seems pretty clear why she didn't tell her mom. So great job being the person your niece needed, you'll probably never know exactly how much it means to her to have someone like you to trust.", "NTA. Your sister will eventually get over her anger. Your niece however, was lucky enough to have you in her life. You honoured her confidentiality which was THE most important thing to her. Good job uncle!", "NTA, you did the right thing. If you had outed your niece to her mom, you likely would have ruined the relationship built between you.", "Your sister is the selfish homophobic asshole, and you are definitely not the asshole. She is intolerant. If her daughter was straight, she would be perfect, so that goes to show you how ignorant she is. Your heart is what defines you and nothing else.", "Absolutely not TAH. Valentina did not feel safe enough to tell her mother. That tells me there\u2019s a lot of issues in their mother/daughter relationship dynamic.\n\nMy opinion: mother felt shame because Valentina confided this information in you, and the result was rage. This is a narcissistic behavior; when they feel shame they rage. \n\nValentina\u2019s mother is the AH for building the type of relationship with her daughter where the daughter cannot trust her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s very few instances where outing someone else is appropriate but this wasn\u2019t one of those times. It\u2019s up to the person when they want to tell people. You have done nothing wrong. You were actually in a better position to give her advice about girlfriends unless your gay or not interested in anyone. If one of my family or friends came with girlfriend problems I would be completely in the dark because I am straight. I learned how yo please a man not a woman. In addition to everything, she came to you and asked you not to tell. She wasn\u2019t doing anything dangerous so there wasn\u2019t a reason to tell anyone! You did exactly right-your sister is either jealous of your closeness or hates homosexuals and is mad you didn\u2019t tell her sooner so she could have \u201cstopped her daughter from making this horrible mistake\u201d! Either way, you did exactly right!", "NTA. Not your story to tell.", "NTA, not at all. Your niece trusted you and you didn't violate her trust.

A person\u2019s coming out is their own journey and only they get to decide where, when, how, and to who. No one should ever take that away from them.\n\nI\u2019m actually a little teary eyed over your decision to stand by her and keep her secret. I was shoved out of the closet by someone choosing not to do the same and it still hurts, even 13 years later. \n\nYour niece will always remember that you had her back and it will always mean something to her, I promise. \n\nNTA and, I\u2019m so proud of you! Your sister is the AH. Instead of talking to her daughter about WHY her daughter didn\u2019t feel like she could come to her about her sexual orientation she\u2019s lashing out at you\u2026which just proves that all the reasons her daughter had for not coming out to her were valid.

Just be there for your niece.", "NTA. your sister should be happy that her daughter has an adult she trusts the way she trusts you! I think she\u2019s more embarrassed that she isn\u2019t that safe place for Valentina.", "As a queer trans woman, the ONLY way you would have EVER been an AH would have been if you did tell her mom. She made you promise to keep it a secret for a reason, and I suspect that reason is her mom being a raging bigot that she didn't feel safe around. \n\nNTA", "NtA.  I have had many secrets told to me by my nieces, nephews and xSO.  They know they can count on me not to tell others.  Things like sexual orientation, abortion, and stealing. Their uncle is now my x, and I could blow the family up with what has been told to me.  I would not do that.  It is not my info to tell.  \n\n It was none of your sister's business.

There are some things I will share with my sib about their kids but only to smooth things over or fix a communication problem and never at the cost of hurting my nibling.  \n\nSide note: My family operates on the understanding that unless specifically or obviouslynot something you repeat, anything you say maybe repeated.  In my sibling circle it\u2019s with the understanding that you\u2019d use the info to help and not cause more problems.  So not to gossip, spread rumors, or to hurt someone.  \n\nBesides all that the hierarchy of loyalty is niblings before siblings.  Future generation\u2019s well being is more important than my sibling\u2019s feelings.  They can be mad at me, I even welcome it if it takes their negative attention off their kid. Mind you I won\u2019t enable harmful or toxic behavior either, I do hold them accountable tho I do give some slack given their age and brains not being fully done cooking but not too much to be considered enabling.  Mostly just to get parents off their back (bc that makes things worse).  \n\nAnd also you just never out someone for this sort of thing period.  Find ways to dance around it if you need to in order to mediate issues between them but never break that trust.  \n\nYou did you right thing.

Your sister can be upset/ hurt but it's not ok that she went off on you and insulted you etc.", "NTA it wasn't your secret to tell, it wasn't your right to determine when she should know about it. Your sis might feel like your loyalty to her should be more important, but I personally think that if you had told, things would have ended up badly. \n \nLike, imagine if you niece discovered that you opened your mouth, she would fight her mom for snooping and you for telling and cause an unnecessary rift between the 3 of you that would help absolutely nobody.", "NTA", "Nta.

She\u2019s probably going through a ton of emotions about this right now and is trying to figure stuff out for herself.  She has a ton of stuff in her head that she doesn\u2019t know what to do with. You just happen to be an easy target.  Hopefully once she calms down and hopefully she will let love win out and everything will be fine.  In which case it needed to come from her daughter and you were right not to tell her.\n\nOr she\u2019s a bigot who is going to disown her daughter and blame you for keeping a secret, in which case you were right not to tell her and you can be there to support your niece.\n\nEither way, NTA.\n\nEdit: fixed a word.", "NTA Teenagers have as much right not to be outed against their will as anyone.", "NTA.

Kids deserve to have a safe place to vent and talk to an adult without fear. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nIt was not up to you to out your niece to her mother. Her relationship, whatever her orientation, is not your happy news to tell.", "NTA.\n\nNope\n\nNope\n\nNope\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nYou made a promise and you kept it as best as you could.", "NTA\n\nIf she wasn't comfortable or ready to talk to her mother about her orientation, it's on the mother for not having her daughter's trust.   Because that's what it's really about.  You showed you could be trusted, and your niece needed that.  It wasn't on you to out her, and I for one am glad you didn't.  There were reasons your niece had for not telling, and it was up to her when she felt safe and secure enough to share.  Her mother's reaction to you tells me your niece was right in her choices.", "NTA.  You handled it perfectly.  You absolutely should not have told your sister.  This was your niece's story to tell, and she was not ready to share this with her mom.  You sister can yell and call you names, but you did right by your niece.", "Just tell your sister, It was not my story to tell.", "Speaking as the aunt with many nieces and nephews who hopes that they will come to me for anything, as long as what she is telling you is not hurting herself or others you have every right to keep her secret. Not to mention as a fellow LGBTQ+ person, how who and when she comes out is 100% her say. NTA", "NTA. Please don't doubt yourself. You were loving to your niece and I am sure she appreciates it. If your sister says anything else, just remind her is was her own words and actions that made her daughter not want you to tell your sister. Tell her to get her act together and follow your example.", "Nta times a million there\u2019s a reason she came to you, you should tell your sister to shape the fuck up if she wants to have a relationship with her daughter", "NTA. You were told something in confidence and as it was not a life threatening issue, you tightly kept the secret.  Your sister is just in shock about the news and if not completely homophobic will learn to love her daughter and daughter in law.  Keep being there for your niece.", "NTA. Had you told your sister that Valentina is queer, you would have lost Valentina's trust and your relationship with her would be permanently damaged.", "NTA. You provided a safe environment for a child who didn\u2019t trust her mother.", "NTA at all. Your neice came out to you because she felt she could trust you and you wouldn't judge her. If she wanted her mom to know, she would have told her, but she chose not to...and we know why.\n\nFeel good knowing you provided love and support to your neice at a time she needed it. If her own mother was any sort of empathetic human being, your niece could have told her, but she didn't feel she could.  \n\nThis is her life, her truth and as a mom of a LGBTQ daughter who came out to her dad and I at age 16, I thank you for not blowing up your neices world. You are so not the AH.", "NTA. If her mom is anything like my mom, whose reactions to things are very unpredictable and blown out of proportion, there is a reason you don\u2019t them things like this. \n\nFor anyone wondering how out of proportion my mom\u2019s outbursts can be, I was once screamed at for an hour for getting a B on a test. The fact I had actually gotten the highest mark in the class on a very hard test didn\u2019t matter.\n\nETA. I now know her behaviour is not normal or ok.", "NTA your sister is. Obviously there was an issue between their relationship to begin with that made your niece uncomfortable to tell her mom in the first place. You are a great uncle and she\u2019s lucky to have you.", "Never out anyone against their will. NTA", "My wife and I had conversations before we had our kids (and since) that we want our kids to know that not only are we, as their parents, here for them... so are aunts and uncles.\n\nI don't need to know everything that's happening in their life, I just want to know that there is someone safe and trusted that they can turn to for advice or to vent, whatever.\n\nI hope that they feel they can come to us, but it's more important to me that they feel safe, loved and happy.", "All of this, especially your last sentence. My fellow parents, if you want your kids to tell you important things about their lives, make sure you show them every day you\u2019re a safe person to tell.", "Honestly, that kind of reaction makes me wonder if the sister is mad she couldn't pressure her daughter to be straight while she was still young. The anger goes way beyond just being upset that your child trusted someone else. And while I'm 100%  speculating, there's definitely a reason the niece refused to tell the mom for eight years.", "Right? Like if my little sister had come to me and said \"I like lighting fires!\" then I probably would have passed that info on. But not this, especially if she asked me not to tell our mom. Not that our mom would have reacted badly - our uncle trusted her with the same info when they were young - but it's her story to tell. NTA.", "Exactly this! If the secret had been something that could have resulted in her harming herself or someone else, that would be a different story. But this was something innocuous and personal. Plus, outing someone without their consent is always an AH move. Absolutely 100% NTA and I'm glad she had a loving and accepting adult in her life! Speaking both statistically and from personal experience, that makes a HUGE difference for LGBTQ+ youth.", "THIS!!!", "Agreed. Most of the time I would say with a minor it\u2019s best to keep their parents in the loop just for the kid\u2019s safety. But with a secret like this, sharing would have actually been what caused the damage by ruining what has been a very important relationship with a respected adult.", "Sister was hoist by her own petard (aka thrown into the air by a bomb she planted).\n\nParents need to either put in the work to earn their kids\u2019 trust or be prepared to do without it.", "This. Not only is OP NTA but if they had told her, they would be a giant AH for outing their niece.", "I am impressed.  I don\u2019t know many people who could say this.  Kudos to you and your wife.", "Unfortunately not everyone believes that statement and having family be there to support and love her is amazing. It\u2019s truly sad that not everyone does give that support.", "You kindof answered your own question. Sadly, there are many people in the world who are NOT Decent, kind, caring, and empathetic.", "I think anytime an adult relative puts the kid's agency who is confiding in them over a sense of obligation to tell parents is pretty amazing. There are a lot of people that view parents as having some level of ownership over their children's'privacy.", "Nope which is why I told my daughter what I did. I can\u2019t speak for what others will like or not like. She literally asked \u201cWill I get used to being with a female?\u201d  That\u2019s not something anyone can tell her. She admitted to be curious. She had thought about a few things concerning another girl.  But I literally can\u2019t say what she will like and not like. And when a person is curious the only way to find out is to try. How is that being a homophobe? I would say that\u2019s the opposite. She\u2019s the one that told me of her friend\u2019s preferences. That was more than likely to see my reaction and if I would try stopping the friendship which I didn\u2019t. How is that being a homophobe? I strongly suspect she at least tried being with a girl and I suspected that at the time she was friends with the girl. I didn\u2019t ask because it wasn\u2019t my business. I never asked if she had a boyfriend either. I only found out when she decided to tell me. I have my own preferences and beliefs. I don\u2019t push them onto others. When I was working I treated all the same. I served straights gays & lesbians, bisexual and transgenders. How friendly I was depended on them, not their preferences. If they were more reserved I respected that. If they were friendly, I was friendly right back. I had one non-binary coworker that I know of. She preferred they and them. So that\u2019s how I referred to them. I had one that identified as male but wasn\u2019t going through any changes they just dressed and acted male. Fine by me. I could care less because it doesn\u2019t effect me at all. Just because I don\u2019t agree with it doesn\u2019t make me a homophobe. It makes me honest. I only mentioned it was to show a stark difference. I was completely trusted by my daughter. She still does. OP\u2019s niece absolutely did not trust her mother. That\u2019s very telling.", "I don't think we should throw everyone like OP a parade or anything, but it's still nice to reinforce objectively good things that aren't the norm with some kind of acknowledgement.", "It doesn't help that the whole thing kind of trailed off into something else lol", "Both the initial comment was confusing (even though I'm a homophobe my daughter should trust me! I'm alluding to the fact I'd prefer her to have an abusive boyfriend than \"hang out with a girl!\" ( And you wouldn't stop her hahaha) Fyi ghostwalker person, she doesn't trust you, and she has absolutely not confided in you. It is batshit you think that) and then the reply (protect the homophobes! It says a great thing about a relationship that a child will venture to talk to a parent! Also I will now talk about unrelated things!) Like what?", "NTA, she didn't feel safe discussing it with her parents. If you didn't take her sexuality seriously and keep it a secret, she would most likely have no family members to discuss it with at all.", "YTA\n\nNever keep secrets from parents. I also have nephews and nieces who have confided in me but I always let their parents know. They\u2019re the parents.", "I am so glad for your niece that she had you. Every child needs at least some person to confide in. You are not the asshole. Thank you for not violating her confidence.", "NTA. You had you niece's back when she felt no one else might have. Every one needs at least one person on their side. Good on you. Do not ever allow anyone to tell you that you were wrong for that.\n\nBesides, it was not _your_ story to tell.", "No, you are not the AH for keeping Valentina's secret about her sexual orientation. She confided in you in confidence, and you respected her wishes by not sharing it with anyone, including her mother. It was her decision to come out to her mother, and it was not your place to disclose her personal information without her consent.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, it's important to respect the privacy and autonomy of LGBTQ+ individuals. Coming out is a personal and often challenging process, and it should be up to the individual to decide when and to whom they want to disclose their sexual orientation. It's not uncommon for individuals to choose to disclose their orientation to some people and not others, and that should be respected.\r  \n\r  \nYour sister may be upset that she was not informed, but it's important to prioritize Valentina's feelings and respect her trust in you. You can explain to your sister that Valentina confided in you in confidence, and that you respected her wishes by not sharing her personal information. You can also emphasize that it was Valentina's decision to come out to her mother, and it's not your place to interfere with that process.", "NTA. All you did was good. Your sister will calm down. She is upset because her daughter didn't trust her.", "Half-jokingly, OP, are you a lawyer? Your \"client-confidentiality\" is absolutely sterling, and you're a rock.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nGood uncle. This is why she trusted you. You are a vault.", "Nta, your sister is not entitled to the knowledge if Valentina didnt feel comfortable telling her", "Nta.....your niece trusted you enough to confide in you....you did what you had to do as far as your niece was concerned. She was never in harm or danger so there was nothing to divulge to her mom.", "It's not your place to out someone else without their permission. NTA", "NTA If she had wanted her to know she would have told her. Not up to you to tell. It was not your information to share.", "Absolutely not the AH here. Your niece **trusted** **you**. That is why she came out to you, not her mother or anyone else in the family. She knew you'd keep this quiet until she was ready to share it with others. Coming out of the closet is scary and you were her safe space, someone whom she could go to and receive advice from that came with no strings attached or judgement.", "NTA. Not your secret to tell. If Valentina was as close to her mother as she was to you, she would have told her earlier. Your sister is just miffed that you are the trusted and safe adult.", "Absolutely NTA. Others have covered what the situation says about Valentina's relationship with her mum, but completely apart from that, it was Valentina's secret to be told (or kept), not yours. You swore not to tell her mum and if you had done so, you'd have violated the confidence she showed in you.\n\nYou were being a good uncle and a good friend; her relationship with her mum is not your problem. Your relationship with Valentina *is*, and you did precisely the right thing by her. She's lucky (and no doubt grateful) to have someone older (from Mum's generation!) who she knows is firmly in her corner.\n\nWell played, sir; you're a good bloke.", "NTA. Thanks for being a good person :-)", "NTA. Not even slightly an asshole, sounds like she made a good decision to come to you, you sound pretty cool", "NTA. You are an adult she feels safe and trusted with. Her mother was not. I would look into any possible abuse or anything that her mother did to not have that kind of trust and interveen on your niece's behsmalf if she wants you to.", "NTA\n\nYou would be an asshole for telling her mom before she was ready. \n\nNot your fault she didn't feel comfortable telling her mom sooner.", "I go by what's the secret and how old are they when they told you. If the secret is putting their life in danger then I am talking. Outing someone is a big no no. She was 16 when she told you. That's a old enough for me to respect a person's privacy especially about their sexuality. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. The secret your niece told you wasn\u2019t harmful. Therefore, not your secret to tell and you were right to keep your niece\u2019s trust in you intact.", "last i checked most heterosexual folks don't have to announce their sexuality and the family doesn't need to be like did you know your child is straight?\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nBeing a confidant for a teen and young adult is a sacred bond, you did right by her, and should be proud of that. Dont let anyones shock ir biases make you doubt that. Had you told her, you would have been a tremendous asshole.", "NTA This was always Valentina's secret, even after she told you. It was never your secret to share, so good on you for understanding that. Her mom needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror and seek the answer to the question of why her daughter didn't feel up to telling her before now. I suspect she won't, though. I seriously doubt she'll like the answer she finds.\n\nI see secrets the same as personal property. You shouldn't loan out someone else's property just like you shouldn't tell someone else's secrets.", "NTA. You did the right thing and kept your niece safe. Outing someone as gay is never the right thing to do. Valentina didn't trust her mother but knew she could trust you. Good for you for keeping your word and keeping your niece safe.", "NTA. It wasn't your secret to tell.", "NTA.  Not your secret to tell.  Maybe if she was a better mom to her first child, she would have been told before now.  Her mom moved on stand had kids with her new husband when she was about 10.  Obviously, Valentina did not feel comfortable as part of that family.  That\u2019s entirely on her mom.", "NTA \nThat\u2019s not your story to tell. If I told someone that I thought i could trust that I\u2019m bisexual and they told my mom. I\u2019d be pissed. I told them that in confidence and it\u2019s something I had been keeping to myself for a long time. I would also feel like my parent should hear it from me when I\u2019m ready rather than someone else!", "NTA. Honestly, thank you for being a safe place for her. Who knows how things could have turned out for her if she had no support or felt she wasn't supported. (I'm not saying your sister is homophobic) But there was a reason your niece didn't feel she could come out to your sister. Please continue to be there for your niece. Your sister can get over her hurt pride.", "NTA\n\nIt's Valentina's business to share.", "Nope, NTA.  Your niece confided something in you and there was no reason to tell her mother. It wasn't dangerous, it wasn't harming anyone, you absolutely had no reason to reveal her secret. Your sister is out of line.", "NTA. I think for this, you did the right thing. If it had been something that endangered your niece (\"Don't tell mom I'm doing heroin!\") then the right thing would have been to tell her, but for this more important to keep your word to your niece. Only thing is maybe told your niece if you thought it was true, \"Really, tell your mom. She'll understand.\"", "NTA! You did the right thing!", "Nope, nope, NTA, not even a little bit\n\nComing out can be an extremely difficult thing to do, even if you think the person you\u2019re telling would be supportive. Sometimes that makes it even worse, because you KNOW they\u2019ll be supportive, but the inherent trauma of being gay still makes you too petrified to say anything. It\u2019s very, very important that the gay person tells people at their own pace, even if that pace is slow. She clearly trusted you enough to confide. The same cannot be said for her mother.\n\nKeeping that secret for a decade proves what a great uncle and fantastic ally you are. Please keep being there for her; if your sister acted that way to you, I worry about how she reacted to the coming out itself. Do you know?", "I feel bad for your sister.  But you are NTA.  I hope your sister, given time, will be thankful that her daughter has you in her life.  She will realize you are  NTA.", "NTA - You were entrusted with a secret that didn't cause her harm and you kept it.", "NTA she should be glad that her daughter has other people in her life that love her besides herself. Tell her you are doing the Aunts basic duties and kids need support from other relatives too it takes a village.", "Damned if you do ( Valentina would be really upset, feel alone and betrayed) damned if you don\u2019t ( your sister\u2019s mad\u2026 families.. it will fix itself over time.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her a safe space. That is all that matters.", "I wish more parents would make sure their kids had good adults who could keep confidences in their lives. I want people my kids can talk to. I expect confidence to be broken *only* in dangerous situations. Otherwise, if you tell the parents, you\u2019re no longer a trusted adult. And kids need adults they can trust who are not their parents.\n\nNTA. Very much NTA. It was Valentina\u2019s business, and hers alone to tell.", "NTA this is why all of the anti-gay bills and teachers forcing to out their students to their parents bills are so bad. Because why is your sister mad? Because she wasn't a safe person to know her child was a lesbian? Was your niece afraid of her step dad knowing? There was a reason you were deemed safe an no one else was. It also says a lot that your niece told no one until AFTER she had her degree/a good job and could not be hurt (beyond emotionally) by your sister or someone in her family knowing.", "It wasn't yours to tell. Good for you for not gossiping.", "NTA - if a child, or even teen, comes to you with a secret that has the potential to cause them harm (ie your 16-year-old niece wants to meet up with the 25 year old they met in and internet chat room, or, they are depressed and thinking about suicide) then yes, you go to their parent. If your 16-year-old niece comes to you with a secret that is in no way dangerous, then you keep their confidence.   Your sister is wrong.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You could\u2019ve chosen to out your niece to her mother and destroy the only safe person she had in her life instead you kept her secret well guarded next to your heart where it belongs. You let her go her own pace and come out when she felt most comfortable. Yeah it was probably a shock for mum when her daughter showed up on her doorstep with a gf and said \u201csurprise! I\u2019m gay!\u201d But that doesn\u2019t make you the asshole whatsoever. If anything you\u2019re a wonderful uncle and you had her back and made sure she had a safe place to talk about her troubles when she needed it most. Go you!!", "NTA not your secret to tell. Niece trusted you with the huge secret and is not anyone\u2019s place to force them out of the closet", "NTA! You are a safe space for your niece and went above and beyond for her.

Don\u2019t let her drag you down and feel bad about being there for her daughter.", "You are a great uncle, OP.  Your niece needed a safe adult in her life in her corner who loves her as she is, her mom obvs was not that person for her.  You did not have a responsibility to address your niece's sexual orientation with her mom/your sis.  Her reaction is proof you made the right call. NTA", "NTA. As someone who was a queer youth whose safe adults did not include her parents, you were right to keep it secret. Now Valentina knows that she can trust you and you continue to be a safe person in her life.", "NTA\n\nIt's up to your niece who she comes out to and nobody else has any right to out her without her say so.", "Unless they are politicians that support laws that harm the community. \n\nNo excuse for that.  No community for those who have betrayed it.", "I'm so very lucky I have my sister! She has been there since day one with my son. They are super close, he tells her things he doesn't tell me.
