You supporting her and her sexuality is truly amazing. If Valentina didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling your sister then that speaks to the relationship she has with her mom and her concerns.

You are a good uncle and it\u2019s clear why your niece trusts you. Valentina asked you not to tell her mom, which is totally reasonable. If this were a secret that was harming her - drugs, self harm, abuse, etc - then it might be appropriate to tell her mom, depending on the situation of course. But her sexual orientation? That\u2019s not harming anyone. I think your sister is just feeling hurt that her daughter didn\u2019t trust her with this so she\u2019s taking it out on you. Well done being a supportive, trustworthy person.", "Absolutely NTA. Her mum perhaps needs to examine the reasons why her daughter felt more comfortable talking to you than she was talking to her.\n \nUltimately you made a promise to someone to keep a secret (nothing that was damaging or dangerous to keep) and you would have been breaching their trust to pass it on regardless of the relationship to you of the person you passed it onto.", "NTA, your niece confided in you something that wasn\u2019t life threatening so there\u2019s no need for you to have told your sister.

Your niece confided in you something deeply personal.  The information did not harm your niece, nor did it harm anyone else, so you were right in keeping it to yourself, honoring her confidence, and letting her tell her mother in her own time.

Let her be mad, but that anger is misplaced and should be directed at herself for making her child feel like she couldn\u2019t tell her mother.", "NTA your niece confided in you. There must be a reason she didn't tell her mum?", "NTA. People come out at their own pace. She obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about this with her mom.

What a lucky niece.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA! What a wonderful uncle you are!", "NTA. You never out someone without their permission, ever.", "Hell, NO. Your sister can pound sand.

It's not your fault that your niece felt she could not tell her mother about it earlier, but she obviously had some reason for believing she couldn't do so.", "NTA at all.

I hope that she will feel I am a safe place like your niece feels that you are.", "A promise is a promise. Had Valentina asked to keep the secret about something that would be dangerous or detrimental to her health/life, someone else's health/life, it would have been necessary and urgent to tell the parents. \n\nBut when it comes to other stuff (any really), it's up to the child to inform the parent when the child is ready. The information is not owed to the parent just because they are the parent. If the child is not ready, then the parent should not know. \n\nPlus : it is crucial for children and teenagers to have a grown up in their lives to whom they can talk about anything, without fear of being ratted.

You were the safe place she needed.", "NTA. It was not your secret to tell. Good on you.", "NTA, not one bit. Your niece needed someone to trust, and you were that person. Your sister may be upset that her daughter trusted you more than her, but that's her own issue to fix.  Plus, it wasn't your information to share, it's your niece's.  She absolutely should be the only one to decide with who and when she wants to come out.  Since you've proven she can trust you, she'll likely continue to come to you when she needs support so please don't question your decision to protect her secret.  Based on her mom's reaction, it seems pretty clear why she didn't tell her mom. So great job being the person your niece needed, you'll probably never know exactly how much it means to her to have someone like you to trust.", "NTA. Your sister will eventually get over her anger. Your niece however, was lucky enough to have you in her life. You honoured her confidentiality which was THE most important thing to her. Good job uncle!", "NTA, you did the right thing. If you had outed your niece to her mom, you likely would have ruined the relationship built between you.", "Your sister is the selfish homophobic asshole, and you are definitely not the asshole. She is intolerant. If her daughter was straight, she would be perfect, so that goes to show you how ignorant she is. Your heart is what defines you and nothing else.", "Absolutely not TAH. Valentina did not feel safe enough to tell her mother. That tells me there\u2019s a lot of issues in their mother/daughter relationship dynamic.\n\nMy opinion: mother felt shame because Valentina confided this information in you, and the result was rage. This is a narcissistic behavior; when they feel shame they rage. \n\nValentina\u2019s mother is the AH for building the type of relationship with her daughter where the daughter cannot trust her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
