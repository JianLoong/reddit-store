I understandably have a lot of nieces and nephews and I've always been the cool uncle to them. However, I'm exceptionally close to one of my nieces (let's call her Valentina - she is now 24).\n\nValentina's parents divorced when she was 6. Her dad was permenantly out of the picture and her mom (48F) remarried and had two more kids (15M and 13F) with her current husband. Valentina has always been close to me but we got much closer after her mom remarried. She is kind of a lone wolf and I am the only one she was comfortable with.\n\nBefore Valentina went to college, at around age 16, she came to me and opened up about liking girls. It was a very emotional day and she made me swear not to tell her mom. I kept my word, and I said I will let her do this at her own speed, and her own terms. She'd come to me with girlfriend issues and stuff, and we would talk but I never told my sister.\n\nValentina worked really hard and got into one of the best colleges and moved away at 18. We still kept in touch, but understandably less so than when she was home.\n\nShe now works in a different state, at a job I'm proud she has. I recently got to meet her current girlfriend (28F) when I was visiting her. I did not tell my sister this as well. Now since Valentina is kind of serious about her GF, she said she was going to tell her mother soon.\n\nYesterday I got a call from my sister, calling me all kinds of names, an AH included. She said I should have told her about Valentina's sexual orientation before and that I was an AH for doing things behind her back. After the phone call, I started doubting myself. Should I have mentioned this to my sister before?", "created_utc": 1679771026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121vopp/aita_for_not_telling_my_sister_about_a_secret/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You supporting her and her sexuality is truly amazing. If Valentina didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling your sister then that speaks to the relationship she has with her mom and her concerns. Maybe your sister should realize that and there is a reason why her daughter choose not to tell her till she was ready too.", "Nope, NTA. If your niece had been comfortable telling her mother earlier, she would have. You did exactly right. Good job, uncle!", "NTA\n\nYour niece told you something in confidence and specifically asked you not to tell her mom. You honored that trust. You would definitely have been TA if you outed her. \n\nFrom your sisters reaction, it seems like there was a reason your niece didn\u2019t want to tell her before. You made the right call.", "NTA --- Your niece trusted you and asked you not to tell her mother if you had done that you could have seriously damaged the relationship that you have with her and she would probably never trusted you again, you did the right thing in keeping this to yourself this was between you and your niece.", "NTA, it your niece that decides who she comes out to and when.", "NTA! You are a good uncle and it\u2019s clear why your niece trusts you. Valentina asked you not to tell her mom, which is totally reasonable. If this were a secret that was harming her - drugs, self harm, abuse, etc - then it might be appropriate to tell her mom, depending on the situation of course. But her sexual orientation? That\u2019s not harming anyone. I think your sister is just feeling hurt that her daughter didn\u2019t trust her with this so she\u2019s taking it out on you. Well done being a supportive, trustworthy person.", "Absolutely NTA. Her mum perhaps needs to examine the reasons why her daughter felt more comfortable talking to you than she was talking to her.\n \nUltimately you made a promise to someone to keep a secret (nothing that was damaging or dangerous to keep) and you would have been breaching their trust to pass it on regardless of the relationship to you of the person you passed it onto.", "NTA, your niece confided in you something that wasn\u2019t life threatening so there\u2019s no need for you to have told your sister. You honored your promise and respected her as a person. A lot of teens don\u2019t get that so you should be proud, you held the safe space for her.\n\nEdit: fixed spelling", "Nope, NTA.  Your niece confided in you something deeply personal.  The information did not harm your niece, nor did it harm anyone else, so you were right in keeping it to yourself, honoring her confidence, and letting her tell her mother in her own time.  Kids desperately need safe people they can talk to.", "NTA. I can respect the fact you kept a secret, even more so since it came from someone that trusted you completely. Let her be mad, but that anger is misplaced and should be directed at herself for making her child feel like she couldn\u2019t tell her mother.", "NTA your niece confided in you. There must be a reason she didn't tell her mum?", "NTA. People come out at their own pace. She obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about this with her mom. If you did tell her, Valentina wouldn\u2019t have as close of a relationship with you, and probably wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable around other people.", "NTA.  That is something your niece gets to share when she's comfortable doing so.  If what she was doing put her in danger, you should tell her mom, but this doesn't put her in danger", "NTA \n\nYou upheld your niece\u2019s trust. That\u2019s a good thing. She wasn\u2019t in any danger so I see no reason to tell her mother. If she was on drugs or getting into some shady shit then there may have been a blurred line but not this.", "Absolutely NTA \nYou did exactly the right thing by being supportive and respecting boundaries.  What a lucky niece.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA! What a wonderful uncle you are!", "NTA. You never out someone without their permission, ever.", "Hell, NO. Your sister can pound sand. You don't out anyone, and especially not teens who are afraid to tell their parents. And obviously your sister's reaction tells you why it had to be a secret while she was at home. NTA.", "Of course you're NTA.  It was a confidence and you were honor bound to keep it. It's not your fault that your niece felt she could not tell her mother about it earlier, but she obviously had some reason for believing she couldn't do so.", "NTA at all. Apparently someone (your niece?) told her that you already knew, which they are free to do; your niece came out at her own pace.  You made a promise about a decidedly non-life threatening development and kept your word. (Kudos to you for that.)", "NTA this was your niece's information to share.", "absolutely NTA. It's your niece's business, it's not up to you to out her. This isn't a situation of something harmful that happened to her and she is afraid to tell her mom. This is a deeply personal issue and not your story to share.", "NTA. I am the favorite great uncle to a five year old niece. I hope that she will feel I am a safe place like your niece feels that you are.", "A promise is a promise. Had Valentina asked to keep the secret about something that would be dangerous or detrimental to her health/life, someone else's health/life, it would have been necessary and urgent to tell the parents. \n\nBut when it comes to other stuff (any really), it's up to the child to inform the parent when the child is ready. The information is not owed to the parent just because they are the parent. If the child is not ready, then the parent should not know. \n\nPlus : it is crucial for children and teenagers to have a grown up in their lives to whom they can talk about anything, without fear of being ratted. At least, one person who cares about them knows that there is nothing dangerous going in the child/teenager's life. It's way better than children and teenagers keeping EVERYTHING to themselves out of fear the info will reach their parents before they want to.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you never ever out anyone if you're not asked by that person to do so.", "NTA. you had her trust and you kept her trust. When it comes to kids I think it's important to tell parents the secrets that could potentially be dangerous to the child, but her sexuality isn't putting her at any risk. \n\nLet your sister cool off and if you feel it would be appropriate speak to her when she is in a better frame of mind and let her know you knew it wasn't your place to tell her", "NTA. You were the safe place she needed.", "NTA. It was not your secret to tell. Good on you.", "NTA, not one bit. Your niece needed someone to trust, and you were that person. Your sister may be upset that her daughter trusted you more than her, but that's her own issue to fix.  Plus, it wasn't your information to share, it's your niece's.  She absolutely should be the only one to decide with who and when she wants to come out.  Since you've proven she can trust you, she'll likely continue to come to you when she needs support so please don't question your decision to protect her secret.  Based on her mom's reaction, it seems pretty clear why she didn't tell her mom. So great job being the person your niece needed, you'll probably never know exactly how much it means to her to have someone like you to trust.", "NTA. Your sister will eventually get over her anger. Your niece however, was lucky enough to have you in her life. You honoured her confidentiality which was THE most important thing to her. Good job uncle!", "NTA, you did the right thing. If you had outed your niece to her mom, you likely would have ruined the relationship built between you.", "Your sister is the selfish homophobic asshole, and you are definitely not the asshole. She is intolerant. If her daughter was straight, she would be perfect, so that goes to show you how ignorant she is. Your heart is what defines you and nothing else.", "Absolutely not TAH. Valentina did not feel safe enough to tell her mother. That tells me there\u2019s a lot of issues in their mother/daughter relationship dynamic.\n\nMy opinion: mother felt shame because Valentina confided this information in you, and the result was rage. This is a narcissistic behavior; when they feel shame they rage. \n\nValentina\u2019s mother is the AH for building the type of relationship with her daughter where the daughter cannot trust her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
