We play upbeat songs and dance and sing together during that. I usually leave for work right away and Iris (she's a SAHM) handles the kids.\n\nMy in laws were staying with us for the first time in the past 5 years. Iris was tired because she'd picked up her parents late at night. Kids wouldn't let go and wanted some music. So I set the volume of the music to the lowest I possibly could (it was barely audible) and told the kids it was a challenge to lip sync quietly.  \n\nAlso, the house is spacious, and the in laws were staying in the guest room that was farthest from the kitchen. We usually do this because we dont want to disturb our guests around the house.\n\nIt was all well until my MIL showed up. She called me an inconsiderate person and said I should have known better. She said I needed to start acting like a responsible adult of my own age and told me she was once again disappointed.\n\nI just said sorry, and thankfully she went into her room. It was hard to keep my mouth shut but I did. I told Iris about this and she was furious. She had a huge fight with her parents. This issue  is now a major conflict on her side of the family. I kind of feel responsible because it all started because of me.

There's nothing irresponsible about singing and dancing with your kids in the morning. If your in-laws don't want to be woken up by small children, they should not stay in a house with small children. Glad your wife stuck up for you!", "NTA, it\u2019s your house. They could have easily stayed at a hotel and dictated what goes on in it. \n\nLow volume or not, it\u2019s inconsiderate to be a guest in someone\u2019s home, expect them to alter their routine, and then insult them.\n\nMIL is an inconsiderate person who should have known better. I\u2019m disappointed someone who\u2019s an adult spoke so irresponsibly while staying in someone else\u2019s house. She should learn to act her age.\n\nYou handled that very well.", "You're NTA. They are on vacation, you are not. It sounds like you altered your routine to accommodate your ungracious guest, but that wasn't enough. Maybe it's time to direct her to a quieter hotel nearby your house.", "Got some nerve criticising like that when she's a guest in your home.  NTA", "NTA. I believe they have overstayed their welcome.", "Tell your MIL she has once again disappointed you.  NTA", "NTA at all, you were taking care of your kids.\n\nSuggest they stay in a hotel next time if basic childcare early in the morning is going to disturb them.\n\nPS: the only thing honestly you could have done better in this situation was informing them up front: we get up at 5am btw. I recommend you do this with future guests, it will manage their expectations and also might mean you don't get quite as many house guests...", "Sounds like the inlaws don't like staying at your place. Probably should get a hotel for themselves. NTA", "NTA - You can do whatever you want in your own home.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour MIL was rude and should have kept most of that to herself. She's an asshole for that.\n\nBut you knew your in-laws got in late. And your kids are 10yo, they are old enough to be told \"No singing/dancing *this morning,* your grandparents had a late night so let's let them sleep in.\"  It was obviously loud enough for someone to hear from across the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
