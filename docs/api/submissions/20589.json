What a shame.", "As someone who is a night owl and hates being woken up early, and also used to travel a lot so knows how fatigued you get after a long trip, I still think the grandma was unnecessarily rude. I understand her discomfort, and I understand that she might be used to speaking that way to her own daughter, whom she knows well, but this is her daughter in law whom she is not close with and hasn't seen in years, and she is a guest in this house. She should have approached the matter more politely, she is an adult, and there were two kids present. Just ask to turn the music off if it is disturbing your sleep, but don't act like the host has disappointed you and is not showing enough hospitality. Politely informing the host if something is causing you distress is one of the travelling rules ingrained into me by my mum, and I am very grateful for it. I've stayed at homes where the hosts' routines were straight up incompatible with mine, and the best way to act in this situation would be to either compromise or adapt, you are going to return home in a week anyway. Doesn't mean that you cannot hold your host accountable for straight-up shitty behaviour, but I wouldn't say that barely audible music early in the morning is crossing the line. It's something that could have been discussed politely and without heated language, even when the grandma is grumpy and running on low sleep. I've been there, I know how hard travelling is, but you gotta stay civil when you are a guest, a household won't just spontaneously change its lifestyle to fit your needs unless you have a calm discussion about it. OP NTA, the grandma TA at the moment, but she was probably just tired and not in the right mindspace, so OP's wife starting a fight instead of approaching the matter calmly and having a talk with her mother sounds excessive, unless there is other family drama involved that we don't know about (and there could be, as some comments have pointed out). The situation sounds a bit blown out of proportion, which makes me think it wasn't really about the music, but more about some underlying interpersonal issues the in-laws are having with the couple. Then again, some families are just like that and will have fights instead of calm discussions, and if it works for them in the end and no relationships are irreparably damaged, then good for them.", "Exactly!", "If you are in the same room as my son, you will swear he is up all night. Nope, he\u2019s sleeping. Just talking and thrashing and rolling all night!", "Wait there's an \"Unexpected new girl quotes\" sub?!", "Happy cake day! And the twins don\u2019t sleep through the night on their own yet (yay shared custody), so they both end up in bed with us. I have the bruises and dark circles under my eyes to prove it."]}
