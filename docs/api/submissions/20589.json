She should have approached the matter more politely, she is an adult, and there were two kids present. Just ask to turn the music off if it is disturbing your sleep, but don't act like the host has disappointed you and is not showing enough hospitality. Politely informing the host if something is causing you distress is one of the travelling rules ingrained into me by my mum, and I am very grateful for it. I've stayed at homes where the hosts' routines were straight up incompatible with mine, and the best way to act in this situation would be to either compromise or adapt, you are going to return home in a week anyway. Doesn't mean that you cannot hold your host accountable for straight-up shitty behaviour, but I wouldn't say that barely audible music early in the morning is crossing the line. It's something that could have been discussed politely and without heated language, even when the grandma is grumpy and running on low sleep. I've been there, I know how hard travelling is, but you gotta stay civil when you are a guest, a household won't just spontaneously change its lifestyle to fit your needs unless you have a calm discussion about it.

The situation sounds a bit blown out of proportion, which makes me think it wasn't really about the music, but more about some underlying interpersonal issues the in-laws are having with the couple.

That is plenty old enough for them to understand that, sometimes, they have to adjust their routines in order to be considerate of others, especially when those people are family guests who got in late the night before and so need to sleep in.
