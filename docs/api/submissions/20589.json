There's nothing irresponsible about singing and dancing with your kids in the morning.

You can do whatever you want in your own home and if your guests don't enjoy that they're free to leave.\n\nYou *are* acting like a responsible adult of your age: you interact with your family in a very positive manner and bond with them every single morning. That's a rarity and a blessing that you all are able to share that with one another. While maintaining your responsibility to your family you were also as accommodating as reasonably possible to your guests.\n\nIt did **not** all start because of you. Your MIL went out of her way to pick a fight in a place where she had no right to and your wife is reasonably pissed at her mother for having the gall to do so.\n\nThis last bit is pure speculation but your MIL saying that she is *once again* disappointed and only visiting once in 5 years suggests that she has it out for you for whatever reason. Feeling responsible for this situation that she caused instead of standing up for both yourself and how your family operates suggests that she's worn you down and you just want to dodge further conflict. Again that much is speculation based off what you've written, but it may be food for thought and something to chat about with your wife.", "NTA.

I rarely see my grands. When I do, I LOVE watching them with their parents.

She's the one that should pull her head out of her posterior and realize that she's imposing on YOUR family and as a guest, should keep her silly and very wrong opinions about what constitutes *being an adult* to herself. She's not the authority: she's old fashioned and silly and I think any of the family that agrees with her should be relegated to very distant and rare contact - just like your MIL.\n\nI would tell her: *I am a responsible adult and my family is very happy and secure in how we comport ourselves in our home. Since we offend you so much, I want to make sure you know that we will never invite you to stay in our home again and we'll do our best to avoid you completely in the future.* \n\nAnd then make sure that the inlaws (or anyone else that thinks the inlaws are right) are NEVER invited back.

They're guests, which means you be polite to them.", "If it was every morning, I would agree, but it sounds like they got in late and were likely tired from travelling (maybe even jetlagged since they flew there after 5years so could be further away). The polite thing to do on the first morning is let them sleep\n\nBut the MIL sounds like a nightmare in general with the disappointed again comment etc", "Regardless your guests in a house where people live.
