I think you caused this situation and of course it\u2019s hypocritical and probably feels like a slap in the face when you let your friend drive.", "That's only for the specific situation of not letting her drive it to her interview. You're getting ruled TAH for what happened afterwards with your friend and how you handled that part.", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t you drive her to the interview?", "Haha as a car person with a WRX and my boyfriend can't drive for shit. Guess who I trusted with my car and guess who takes care of it just as much.\n\nEdit: also guess who's family has the sick mechanic that helps me and godforbid anything happens to her, my bf is more than willing to help", "I am and OP is the AH", "I absolutely do not understand why you\u2019ve been downvoted so hard. It\u2019s a manual transmission, it\u2019s a sentimental car AANNDD she hasn\u2019t driven a manual in years. There\u2019s also the very strong possibility she\u2019s a terrible driver, but that\u2019s me being an AH. \n\nIf you don\u2019t understand cars and the vibe, I can\u2019t explain.", "Yup.", "Do you figure you could ride a bicycle still?\n\nWhat's the fucking difference?\n\nIt's not rocket science, it's remembering how a clutch works.  That's it.  There's a bunch of people on this thread who think that learning this skill is a magical sign of your superiority, but it's not.  It's just a fucking stick shift.  It's not that deep, bruh.", "And gets to the point in a timely fashion! But dressing up your assholeness with a sweet story of your childhood and first car doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to see right through it.", "Yep. Otherwise, why couldn\u2019t he have picked her up and driven her to the interview? YTA, OP, and it sounds like you have no respect or concern for your wife.", "& ask for the car in the settlement. :-)", "you agree with the last statement because you\u2019re only going to show her comments that agree with you. let her read the whole thread and see where you land.", "I would be hesitant to let someone who hates my car drive it. \nWould destroying the gearbox be more than the car is worth to replace? \nBecause the next question is, if the car were deemed not drivable or repairable, what would you replace it with? \n\nThe circumstances are what makes things tricky here. But I do think you and your wife should go driving in a stick shift so that if this situation happens again you would be assured she could in fact drive your car.", "You *do* understand that the problem is not even a little bit what kind of car it is don\u2019t you? \n\nIt could be the most suped up muscle car around or a shitty \u201800s Civic. That\u2019s *not* the point. \n\nThe point is that *for years* you have denied her the right to drive a car that she has to see every day\u2014even with yourself in the car with her to help her through any idiosyncrasies that the car might possess\u2014with the given reason being no one is allowed to drive it but you. That right there is shitty behavior but would be tolerable if you had stuck to your guns. \n\nBut the fact that you let your friend be an exception to this rule *for the sake of a good time* and you refused her the right to it when it was a matter of necessity to get to a job interview on time is what puts you straight into the AH category. \n\nShe had an **actual need** of the car and you doubled down on her only to turn around *behind her back* and let a friend drive it for \u201cnostalgia\u201d.", "They did not say that. She got to the interview Kate and already in a stable job.", "No, it's not ok... This time was a job interview and if it was an emergency?\n\nThe fact she was precautions about the time don't clean his act", "He said she asked to drive the car when they were younger and he said no then, too. Doesn't seem like that's the issue, just an excuse. Honestly, if he hadn't let the friend drive the car I would say NAH. I think it's weird to refuse to let your spouse drive your car even though they know how and they're a responsible driver. But ultimately it's his car so his choice. However, to refuse to let her drive it all these years and then let a friend do it makes it clear to me he has reasons for not letting her touch the car that he's not being honest about, possibly not even to himself.", "Yeah, he's not the AH for not letting her drive it to the interview. Not only had she not driven stick for a good while, but it's an old car. Combine that with the pressure and nerves to get to the interview on time after being stressed from her own car not working, it's a recipe for disaster. She'd likely end up being far later than she was with the Uber.\n\nWhile not the AH for that situation, the rest is an issue. Some further conversation about her ability to drive a stick, maybe an offer of some gentle lessons on how to drive this particular classic car, so she can drive if needed in the future, preferably all discussed  before the friend came by to drive the car.", "\ud83d\ude06", "YES. I wish I had an award to give you for this.", "Unless you\u2019re spouse will wreck the transmission or more. You can be absolutely devoted to a person but understand and accept their shortcomings. Whether the one you love accepts them, well.", "Driving a stick is like riding a bike, you never forget how to do it.

You just don\u2019t forget", "they\u2019re married, and live together. he should have made sure she could drive the car in case of any emergencies.", "When is the last time you rode a bicycle? Did you forget how?  \n\nThis argument is all over this post and it's stupid as fuck.  When you learn how to do something...

Why have you never given her the opportunity to drive the car at all? There had to have been countless opportunities over the years where you could have been in the car with her and ensure she knows how to do it. She could have kept up her hand at driving a manual. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about the interview, though that\u2019s the most glaring and recent thing, it\u2019s about all the years of not trusting her enough to even give her a chance.", "This doesn't change the fact you're putting your love for the car above your love for your wife.\n\nYou're not even concerned for your wife's safety if she had driven it and let her nerves get the best of her - you're solely focused on the condition of the car in the event of an accident.", "That makes him letting his buddy drive it make even less sense. OP specifically told his wife that he is the only person he trusts to drive the vehicle, then showed her that he has less trust in her than his friend.", "Man cars are no longer sold manual. That doesn't make the Camry I learned to drive on a work of art.", "So you'll let someone with a shitty track record drive it?!", "You just said you drove manual for a while. She literally just took driving lessons in manual and never touched it again. Thats how it sound. I dont want a beginner manual driver to drive my car.   \n\n\nBesides from my experience with a friend its not like riding a bike. The foot for  the clutch is completly diffrent movement then gas/break. And you will lose the muscle memory how to handle it. I dont belive 25 years without ever touching manual you didnt let the gear scream or stalled the engine.", "What? That makes no sense at all.\n\nIf they're somewhere remote and it's the only form of transport yes.\n\nBut there are other methods of transportation available to her.", "yeah because riding a bicyle is as hard as to drive a car. Oh wait its not. There is a reason driving school exist for cars and not bicycles. Besides Balance is a everyday occurence you mangage. The muscle memory to handle a clutch not so much. Im not sayin you cant get the hang of it fast but until then you will stall the engine and let the gear scream. I dont  want that happening to my car.", "Not saying it should change the judgment in this case, but I did actually forget how to ride a bike lol.", "I have interviewed over 500 applicants (prior recruiter) and can nearly guarantee it did", "TLC played some weird shit when I still had cable.

If something super unexpected happens call the recruiter or your contact and explain the situation calmly and provide an eta or ask to reschedule ahead of time.", "The problem is, as an interviewer you have no idea if they are telling the truth or not. You have no idea if this is a regular occurrence or not. It is definitely a red flag. What if you hire the person and every week they are late because reasons.
