This is coming from a business owner of a car related business.", "Hmmm... unless the car was Fucking Eleanor it can be replaced...I bet it is a Focus in some dumb bright color with under lights or something. A) also it is only about 10 to 15 years old not a vintage B) if my husband who is a terrible stick shift driver needed to use an old stick shift for a job interview I would say yes.... because I love him more than even replacing a transmission. Which aren't that delicate.", "OP about to find out who is actually partial owner in the settlement", "Wow. What if she got the cat too. Dang.", "Ehhh I drove a manual irregularly through my teenage years, but not for the past two decades. I like to think I could do so again given the need. But I wouldn\u2019t just jump in and go with no re-training and not expect some issues. Depends how comfortable she got with it in the first place. I never really did.", "I wouldn\u2019t let anyone practice in my transmission. \n\nEvery transmission is different and will take time to adjust to. I\u2019d imagine you don\u2019t have a manual car and think they\u2019re all the same.", "Maybe it\u2019s because you sound like a run of the mill misogynist who doesn\u2019t care about his wife", "If you want to prove to her that this is truly about the ability to drive it without it getting damaged, then I think you need to find a stick shift to rent (if that exists) or borrow for a week for her to practice on. \n\n\nAlong with a promise that if she has no problems driving it, she'll be allowed to drive the old car if needed. And keep that promise. \n\n\nThe whole \"no one's allowed to drive it except me\" has gone out the window now, you're not getting that back.", "You agreeing with that final statement is your issue. You just caused a huge rift with your wife and that\u2019s on no one but yourself.", "I wouldn't say that. I was in the car with my friend and he drives a manual on the regular. My wife was alone and already slightly stressed. I feel like these are two very different situations.", "Ha ha ha. I read this in the voice of a kindergartener\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83c\udfb6OP and GaudyCar, sittin\u2019 in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g! \ud83c\udfb6", "https://youtu.be/06BFsQ_28Co", "So true! lol", "Yeah, I\u2019ve driven a manual on and off for over 20 years. I\u2019ve never forgotten.", "I know right!", "Hit or miss... if I don't drive for a while, the first few rounds I stall a lot and crunk a little on the gears. Been driving an automatic for a few years (barely that).", "Manuals are becoming rarer by the day. If it gets damaged, it may not have a replacement for sale anywhere in the world. \n\nIt\u2019s like a rare Picasso painting at this point. It should be in a museum. \n\nYou don\u2019t realize how it\u2019s value will skyrocket.", "I was gonna say low ride Civic with a rear spoiler and loud muffler, but\u2026", "The same could be said for any vehicle. They all drive differently. I learned to drive in a Mitsubishi Eclipse, which was a manual transmission, back in 2010. My current vehicle is Fusion SE, and I enjoy driving in sport and shifting gears myself, though it is vastly different driving an automatic that can go \"manual\" than a true manual transmission. \n\nThat being said, that's your opinion and you're entitled to it for sure. My point was that the OP was saying their wife is out of practice, while also stating that she had asked to drive before and they refused, thus being the reason she's out of practice. While also letting another person drive the vehicle. Just not her. His wife. Who he married.", "He\u2019s not going to do that. This guy just doesn\u2019t like his wife.", "If you were my husband, this would cause a big rift between us. I just wouldn\u2019t feel like you are on my team. I hope she has supportive friends and family.", "You wouldn't say that, but that's what you did.", "You wouldn't say that, but that's what you did.", "It\u2019s not two different scenarios you almost cost your wife a job because clearly don\u2019t trust your wife. Why did you marry her if you don\u2019t trust her?", "your post and comments are a lot to say \u201ci don\u2019t trust my wife.\u201d", "You literally did say that, with your words and with your actions. \n\nYTA", "Is your friend going to let you stay at his place when your wife divorces you?", "Your wife learned she can\u2019t count on you and can\u2019t have your respect. \n\nYour marriage is likely over. You chose your friend and your car over her.", "Sounds like a \"you\" problem", "Picasso? Really? \n\nOP admits that the car doesn\u2019t make sense to own and that he only keeps it for nostalgia. You\u2019re going to equate that to a rare work of art?  \nIf it\u2019s *that* valuable why is he driving it at all.", "Except OP admitted his wife knows how to drive manual and has a better driving record than his friend.  You\u2019re attempt at hiding your misogyny is so thin it\u2019s transparent", "Manual cars are everywhere in the UK. So not really Picasso!", "You\u2019d let a friend with a history of smashing classic paintings near your Picasso? OP said his friend has a shitty driving record. Your argument sucks since he\u2019s letting his friend with a shitty driving record and history of damaging cars drive but not his wife. Makes no sense, dude.", "That's fine I don't like her either", "Exactly. It\u2019s a Picasso to HIM.", "Yeah sure. It\u2019s not your transmission thst will be damaged, so give whatever opinion you want.", "Clever.", "What a child", "It's not vintage ffs,it's an old car. He can't value it too highly if he trusts his friend with the dubious record.lol.", "It is, at minimum, 10% more clever than the overused AITA comment saying someone doesn't like their partner.", "He can love his wife just fine and not want her using his golf clubs.", "You\u2019re on a roll, buddy.\n\nThis guy doesn\u2019t care if his wife made it to the job interview because she already had employment. He doesn\u2019t care that he hurt her feelings. He wanted to come on here to get feedback that he\u2019s NTA so that he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with his wife\u2019s emotions. Nothing about what he has posted has given any indication that he cares about her.\n\nHave a good night, funny guy.", "He should have just married his golf clubs then. He clearly respects them more than the human being he supposedly claims to love.", "Everything I've said here has been 100% serious\n\n\nAnd why do you talk like that?"]}
