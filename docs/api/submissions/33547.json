We have three classes together and enjoy each other's company a lot. I\u2019m going to be completely honest when I say Barbara is a bit of a troublemaker. I\u2019ve known this throughout my high school life but only ever thought she was a troublemaker in a fun sort of way.\n\nFor the past few months, Barbara and I have been going to each other's houses a lot. During this time, random things at my house started to go missing\u2014headphones, books, one of my hats, etc. All started vanishing. My parents (M56 and F53) and sister (F16) all chalked this up to just misplacements, and I thought the same as well. I\u2019ll also point out that all this stuff started going missing around the time Barbara started coming over, but I thought this was just a coincidence at the time.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mom\u2019s favorite watch completely disappeared without a trace. We searched high and low but didn\u2019t find it anywhere. The watch had a very distinctive look to it since it was from overseas and given to my mom by her younger brother (who has since passed away). She was completely distraught at losing it since it was the last thing he gave her before he passed away.\n\nSo a few days ago, I was at Barbara\u2019s house, and we were chilling in her room. At some point, her mom called her, and she left me alone. While she was away, I saw something shiny on her desk. It was largely covered by books, but I got curious and took a closer look. Lo and behold, it\u2019s a watch identical to my mom\u2019s.\n\nI was so shocked at seeing it that I didn\u2019t think twice and just put it in my pocket. When Barbara came back, I made up an excuse about needing to be home and left. I showed the watch to my parents that night, and my mom confirmed it was hers. My mom thanked me many times over for finding it, and I made up a lie about finding it under the kitchen sink.\n\nThe day after this at school, Barbara was acting really different around me. She seemed guarded and kept giving me one-word answers when I attempted to have a conversation with her. At the end of the day, she told me that I was \u201csneakier than she thought.\u201d I just told her that she surprised me. She actually laughed at this and told me that she wasn\u2019t a thief and that she thought we could trust each other. She then said that she didn\u2019t plan on keeping it for very long and would have returned it sooner or later and that she expected me to have more faith in her. I told her that I felt conflicted, and the conversation sort of fizzled out.\n\nI told some of my friends about it later (since I\u2019m still far too ashamed to tell my family and especially my mom). Most of the guys think that Barbara is pretty crazy, but one of them (Jon, M17) brought up the fact that I was an asshole for not trying to hold a conversation with Barbara before taking the watch and I\u2019m a bigger asshole still for not being transparent with my mom on how the watch got back.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703208126, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o2y8x/aita_for_stealing_my_moms_watch_back_with_no/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I stole my mom's watch back from the girl who stole it from our house. I then gave it to my mom while lying about where I found it.\n2. I failed to be honest with my mom about where I found the watch, I was also pretty cold and distant to the girl who stole it.

She admitted she had taken your mother\u2019s watch. Why would you trust a thief that she would have brought it back?", "NTA. She is bad news, and I wouldn\u2019t let her in my house again.

This girl will probably try again with other things, she stole from your family then said I thought \"you\" trusted me more........... girl you were trusted enough to were you were close enough to my family and their things to steal in the first place. I trust you no more. A thief is a thief is a thief and nothing more.(I def would never keep a thief as a friend, especially after they stole from my family)", "NTA.  She stole it, she doesn't deserve the \"explanation\" of why you took your property back.\n\nDon't leave her unattended around your property again if you can help it.", "NTA, she's been stealing your stuff. She said that to guilt you, but she definitely was not going to return it and won't return any of your other stuff either\n\nYou should probably not hangout with her anymore", "NTA- but you will be the AH if you don't tell your parents about this. You obviously know this thief has the rest of the \"missing\" items from your house and your parents deserve to know what happened here.\n\nTell your mother the truth and speak to her about if filing a police report is the right course of action.

She would not have brought the watch back either, she is not your friend.", "NTA. Barbara actually _is_ a thief. She is lucky that you solved it in this way. She could have been reported to the police, although they might not have done much about it unless the watch was very expensive. I wouldn't let Barbara into my house any more after this. I don't know what kind of delusion she is suffering from if she thinks what she is doing is in any way acceptable. It is not.", "NTA. Don't let her come over anymore. She is a thief. She repeatedly robbed you and your family. She never returned any of that stuff and she had no intention of doing so. If you'd talked to her before taking the watch back she'd lie to your face.", "Never let her over again. You\u2019re 17 so maybe you\u2019ll have to learn this the hard way, but bad people aren\u2019t actually all that interesting. They\u2019re just chaotic. Hopefully you\u2019ll learn the difference sooner than later.", "NTA.  Now tell her to give back the rest of the missing stuff and you won\u2019t involve anyone else in this.  Course when you get it back, you should tell everyone.  Doubt this is the first time. Both sets of parents should be told too. She needs intervention with a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Why? Because I hope they can help you navigate the fact that she is not a true friend, is awfully dishonest, and it's in your best interest to quit hanging with her altogether. A true friend is someone who wants and acts in your best interest and therefore in the best interest of your family. This girl is a snake and it seems you're having trouble seeing this. I hope you learn to become much more discerning, it's an important one. Hopefully in telling your parents, you can open a discussion about becoming more discerning. Also, you'll see when you're a lot older how shitty it is to lose a keepsake from a deceased, loved family member. This girl doesn't give a damn about how her devious actions affect another person. Not a damn, and that includes you. Do you realize how piss-poor cold that is. I'm happy your Mom got her watch back. I hope you get your sovereignty back. Lose her and get yourself on track man. You can find people that you'll laugh and enjoy conversing with that will be an all-around positive experience. Those people exist. Open to them.\nI actually feel that you are at a very important place and decision in your life. How you choose to handle this, your relationship with her and that with your parents, can send you in two totally different life directions. It's awesome you posted this.

I don't know how to tell her I essentially been letting a thief into the house", "Please consider the fact that it'd be a much greater shame to not being this up. You making a mistake is something to learn from, not feel shame over.\n\nContinuing to not say anything though, and failing to further protect your family (by explaining to your mother what happened, and letting them know to be wary of this thief) would be a far greater shame imo.\n\nBy not discussing this with your mom, you're actively protecting a thief.", "but you didn't KNOW it.  it will be worse if you don't say shit, because she can still come over and thief.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nexplain to your mom what happened.  you can say you lied because you're ashamed you were friends with her.  but you need to tell her.", "Oh it's not your fault. Dishonest people hide who they are. Luckily you found out who she is this early. I hope you read my other comment and I hope it helps you."]}
