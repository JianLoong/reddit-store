My parents are divorced and both remarried, so I am inviting my mum, stepfather, stepbrother, and my dad and his wife (we'll call her Amanda). \n\nMe and my dad get along well, but we're not close, and haven't been since we got together with our respective partners (he's never liked my husband, I've never liked his wife), because his trying to force a relationship between me and Amanda and her kids drove a wedge between us. We enjoy each other's company, but we rarely see each other since I moved abroad and keep things very surface level. Amanda and I are cordial on the rare occasion we cross paths (maybe thrice a year in the last 4 years). \n\nSince this is the first year my husband and I live in the country we hope to settle in, I decided to host Christmas, and I invited my dad and, by extension, Amanda. I didn't expect my dad to come, since Amanda has three kids of her own, one severely disabled (Lucy), but he accepted the offer. He asked if Amanda could bring Lucy since it would be impossible to travel without her, I said yes. \n\nWhen I spoke to my dad, I told him that our apartment is not big enough for everyone to stay because my mum, stepdad and stepbrother would be staying over, so I would make hotel reservations not far from our apartment. My dad said this was fine. A few days later, my dad called asking if there was any way he, Amanda, and Lucy could stay at our apartment instead, since traveling with Lucy was very difficult and the stimulating environment of a busy hotel and accessibility issues would be hard to manage. I reiterated there wasn't any space. My dad accepted this and said he may come alone to Christmas in that case, or not at all, and I was said I was fine with either.\n\nAnother few days go by and I get a call from Amanda, livid that I wouldn't let them stay at our apartment after my dad explained the issues. Amanda said I should have had my mum, stepdad, and stepbrother stay at the hotel instead for the few days she and Lucy and my dad would be there, because of Lucy's special needs. She said it was appalling that she should have to spend Christmas without her husband or be stressed over the holidays because I'm so spoilt I refuse to compromise. I told Amanda that my courtesy invite to her as a plus one, who had herself intended to bring a plus one, didn't really necessitate a compromise, whether she was there and who she spent Christmas with wasn't my concern. I told my dad the same when I spoke to him, and gave him a deadline to decide whether he was coming.\n\nMy husband says I was absolutely right not to put myself out for people I wasn't concerned with seeing anyway, but my mum and stepdad think it was harsh, since they could have stayed a few days at the hotel and come to the apartment after my dad and co had left.

They weren't invited to stay. They tried to invite themselves. It's your house, you get to invite whom you want. Amanda can go pound sand.", "NTA - Amanda sounds entitled, and expects special accommodations because her daughter is disabled. TBH, Amanda probably feels slighted that you chose your mom and her extended family over your dad, her, and her spawn; and that\u2019s find, because you\u2019d be more comfortable with ppl you love and care about, and respect is mutual.", "NTA- and one bit of their argument is fallacious. The hotel is absolutely going to be better equipped in regards to accessibility than your apartment. The fact that this was brought up says to me that they are being intentionally intellectually dishonest. I don't know what the game is, exactly, but they're playing one.", "NTA everyone saying YTA need to exercise some common sense. You and Amanda don't like each other your dad and husband don't like each other so why would you share living space? You agreed to pay for their hotel which you didn't have to do. It's your house you decide who you do or don't want there.", "NTA no good deed goes unpunished", "Nta. Amanda wants drama for Christmas.  At least you got her what she wanted.", "NTA. You were clear about what you offered.", "I'm normally the first person to start raising hell about ableists, but i don't see where you did anything wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \nAmanda's daughter being disabled is not, and should never be, your problem.", "NTA - Your invite was to come for the holiday, not actually stay in your home.  And Amanda is being a total AH for trying to insist that a private residence not converted for the purpose is going to have better accessibility for her daughter than a hotel that will have things like ramps, elevators and bathrooms that are usable.  This sounds like a simple power play and good for your husband for having your back.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nIt is your home and you choose who are are willing to open it too. You and Amanda avoid each other, so why would you want her in your home for multiple days?\n\nAnd I have to say, depending on where you live, that a hotel is likely a much better accommodation for a person with disabilities. Most hotels have rooms with wheelchair access so the bathroom is large and accessible, and the room has space for a wheelchair to move around. You don't clarify the disability, but anything that is physical (you say they had \"accessibility\" concerns\") would be eased by an accessible hotel room far more than it would be in your apartment, unless it is designed for a wheelchair user too. \n\nA hotel room is also quiet. A hotel lobby isn't, but once in the room most of them are designed to cut out much more noise than a bedroom in an apartment. They will also be able to be alone, so Lucy can have quiet time, watch the type of TV she wants, and hotel rooms have less stimulation than a strange home (beds, TV, basic furniture) as opposed to an unfamiliar apartment filled with strangers visiting, decorations, kitchen noises, etc. \n\nNo matter her disability, unless your apartment is specifically designed for those disabilities, a hotel room is superior in most every way. \n\nSo this feels very much like Amanda taking an opportunity to assert her dominance and my guess is would continue to do so in your home. I can imagine how that would look as well- what time meals happen, quiet time, etc- and I think it would be remarkably unpleasant to have her- Amanda- in your home.", "NTA\n\nI know many people are going to vote me down or go y.ta. but you're not.  You invited your stepmother and stepsister out of reluctant courtesy to your dad, you don't actually desire to see the two steps. Not only did your Dad ask to add another mouth to fees at Xmas, but he's asking you to host two people to stay in your house that you're not comfortable being around to begin with. You're not required to make sacrifices because Lucy has special needs. Would it be nice if you did, yes. But you're not required to and don't let anyone tell you you have to.\n\nI have a stepfamily that I love and am often eager to see. But I've literally known them my entire life. (My stepfather is also my godfather). You can't force a step family relationship and when you try, it can lead to resentment. \n\nThey don't have to go spend Christmas with you if they can't manage Lucy's needs.  Because it's their responsibility to manage Lucy, not yours.", "Speaking as a disabled person, NTA. It's difficult enough to have houseguests, it's more difficult to have houseguests with severe needs - I will never stop being grateful to two friends who hosted me while I was going through morphine withdrawal (long story) because holy shit what they put up with for a week was superhuman. You two know who you are.\n\nThe compromise here was that you were happy to have them come if they could handle staying in a hotel or a rental. If they couldn't? That's sad but not really always avoidable. We don't call it disability because there is never any impact on our *ability* to participate fully in life, amirite?\n\nWith that - I can see from her perspective that you can't reasonably ask her to come without a child dependent on her for care, but then it's up to her whether her relationship can handle christmas apart from your Dad. If it can't? Then neither of them come and that's sad but no-one's fault and maybe you do a video call or something on the day like normal people. Disability sucks and sometimes you miss out on stuff, and that's life!", "My favorite people in this story are your very flexible mom and stepdad, but I still think you're NTA--you were nice enough to extend the invitation to Amanda and Lucy and find accommodations nearby, but you're not required to prioritize them over all other guests due to Lucy's disabilities.  In addition, it seems like a crowded apartment would be more stimulating and less accessible than a hotel, but what do I know? It just feels like a powerplay by Amanda.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe is definitely the spoiled one in this story.", "NTA simply because its natural to choose the side of the family that you're closer to spend the few days actually staying with you.\n\nIt's your flat. *No one* can make you host people there that you're not happy to for longer than you're willing to do so. \n\nIf I didn't get along with someone I wouldn't want them to stay in my house. The most I would say is fair would be to check with the hotel to ensure their facilities are suitable.", "NTA your fathers new wife is a bit entitled and an AH. Your house your rules", "Anyway. It always astounds me. That people invite \"family\" they don't like to celebrations like Christmas ??!! Why?? If people don't like each other, don't force them together at Christmas time..... Way to ruin what should be a good day.\n\nJust have your father visit some other time. And have him stay at a hotel if he doesnt get  on with husband.\nDon't see Amanda or daughters. Not necessary. \n\nAt OPs age. There is no need to pretend you're all one big happy family.\n\nJust have mother & co. Catch up with dad some other time.\n\nYou're obviously not willing to compromise. So just say to dad \"this won't work. Let's catch up another time\"", "Wait, if your mom is willing to stay at the hotel, what's the problem? \n\nYTA if you can't see the solution in front of you.", "YTA honestly (although the step mom is one too but this is not an  E S H situation)\n\nif you really wanted your father to come, once you heard his request, you could have had your mom and stepdad stay at the hotel instead. How hard would it have been to swap who stays at the hotel? But you didn't do this because you prefer your mom and her family and you don't want to deal with your dad's wife and her child- which you basically admit. Even your mom and stepdad said they were willing to stay at the hotel but it doesn't matter, none of you want to try to even be civil.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
