He is telling friends, family, and our children, that I am evil, greedy and have caused him more pain than anyone should endure.\n\nWhen my ex-husband and I divorced 8+ yrs ago, he paid $1,700 monthly to help support our 3 children based upon our income and the state of residence..\n\nThe children and I moved to another state in 2018 which has a significantly higher cost of living. I chose not to have the child support readjusted to the new state\u2019s guidelines which would have been $2,400 per month. I kept it at $1,700 for 24 months, saving him around $16,800. Keeping the peace.\n\n2 years later his salary was reduced and the new monthly amount would have been $1,985 per month for 3 children. I agreed to drop the existing payments down further to $1,200 per month. For 23 months, I saved him an additional $18,055. Again, keeping the peace.\n\nOver the course of those 4 years I saved him around $34,855. \n\nWhen our oldest child turned 18 last spring, I was planning to engage him on future payments. Before I could, he reduced the child support from $1,200 per month to $800 per month, on his own without even mentioning it to me. He stated since there are now only 2 children, reducing it by a third was logical and appropriate. \n\nCurrent state guidelines for 2 children are around $1,700 per month, $800 was way too low for me. I suggested keeping the payments at $1,200 per month. His response, \u201c\u2026the only way I\u2019m paying more is if a court orders me to\u201d, along with some other choice words.\n\nThat statement seemed pretty final to me, so alrighty then, off to court we go, for the full amount.\n\nWithin a few days of being served the court papers, he sent me a letter stating that he now felt $1,200 per month was acceptable and asked me to reconsider my previous offer. \n\nI declined because of his previous demand and attitude, and other more serious issues going on.\n\nWe went through mediation and agreed he would pay the state\u2019s recommended payment of $1,700 per month and back payments since last spring totaling more than $7,000. I did not request back payment for the preceding years since that was my choice.\n\nThe court order will be signed soon ordering him to pay the new monthly amount plus back payments.  We\u2019ll see if it happens.\n\nI understand that perhaps I was too considerate over the past years by not readjusting the payments as living situations changed and he became accustomed to it. Keeping the peace has it's price.\n\nI\u2019m considered evil, greedy and the cause of all his problems. It wouldn\u2019t bother me accept for the fact that he\u2019s saying these things to our children. They know better but, I worry that the continued barrage of comments from him will negatively affect them and their relationship with him.", "created_utc": 1678038433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11j4p1v/aita_for_not_agreeing_with_my_exhusband_who_only/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
