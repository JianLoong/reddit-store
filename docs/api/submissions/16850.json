{"id": 16850, "submission_id": "13d7fl6", "title": "AITA for confronting my dad about supporting my cousin financially but not me?", "selftext": " Throwaway acc because I don't want the people I know IRL to know about my familial issues\n\nI (23F) just recently graduated college a few months ago. 3 days ago, my father celebrated his 50th birthday by throwing this huge party at our place. I got to see a lot of my relatives again, which was awesome because I\u2019ve basically been MIA at most family gatherings since I used to go to college out of state for the past few years. During the party, I caught up with my cousins and found out that my father had been giving my one of my cousins a monthly allowance for the past three years to help her out. I was hurt when I found out about this because my father never gave me any financial support, besides the common necessities like clothes, which also stopped the day I turned 18. I worked at McDonald\u2019s since I was 16 for 2 years just so I could buy myself some nice things once in a while, because I knew asking for certain things, like headphones or shoes would be a waste of time.\n\nI had to take out student loans and community scholarships to pay for college. Throughout college, I had to work a full-time job which practically paid minimum wage, basically doing graphic design for a small marketing company. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I liked the job because it was remote and I had flexible hours. Basically, as long as I reached 40 hours a week and handed in my work on time, I would get my pay check, which was great since I had to cover my own expenses for things like housing and food. \n\nThe fact that my father had been helping my cousin out while ignoring my financial struggles really hurt. I\u2019ll admit, my cousin comes from a poorer background, but we aren\u2019t made of money either, we\u2019re practically lower middle class. The whole thing put me in a real pissy mood, mostly because my brain was very much in ????? mode. He knew I was struggling, barely getting more than 3-4 hours of sleep a day while trying to maintain my job and getting decent grades so I wouldn\u2019t lose my scholarships.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm being entitled right now but to me, it isn\u2019t about the money, but more so the feeling of having my struggles overlooked all these years. I spoke to my dad about it the next day after his party and the gist of the entire conversation we had was \u2018I fed you and took care of you for 18 years, I helped your cousin for only 3 years because your aunt was struggling and you\u2019re upset I didn\u2019t spoon feed you too? It\u2019s already been done, let it go\u2019. Basically, he thinks I\u2019m an entitled adult baby and he\u2019s gotten my aunt involved. They both think I\u2019m an asshole for bringing it up and confronting my dad about this, because I\u2019ve already graduated and it shouldn\u2019t be an issue for me because I\u2019m not struggling financially anymore.\n\nAITA here for bringing it up?", "created_utc": 1683669449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d7fl6/aita_for_confronting_my_dad_about_supporting_my/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Finding out that whilst they haven\u2019t got your back - they have someone else\u2019s makes you feel less than. Like you don\u2019t count. \n\nHe says he supported you fir 18 years - like you were a burden and you knew in that time not to ask for things. Then he freely gave to someone else - the comparison for me would hurt", "NTA... maybe go NC for a while... let him keep taking care your cousin eventually your aunt and cousin will drain him .. . They sound like they are depending on him and he is enabling them..good job on becoming successful and pushing your way through life", "NTA\n\nI would want to know too. His answer sucked, and it\u2019s not worth pushing the issue. His answer isn\u2019t going to get better until he has a change of heart.\n\nIf you have the means, I would schedule a session with a therapist to work through these emotions. It sucks, but you don\u2019t want this hurt to taint your whole life.", "NTA. He took care of you for 18 years because he is legally obligated to. That is how having a kid works. He did not treat you and a sibling unequally, he actually favored your cousin over you, you have every right to be hurt.", "Nta. If I were you, i would go low contact with him. Your dad didn't even care about the struggles you had. Feeding under 18 is a legal responsibility. Above 18, it's a moral support. Especially, when he was so keen to keep your cousin fed.", "NOPE! NTA! Your \"dad\" and your aunt are though! He provided the bare minimum of support for you as every parent should do! NOT very impressive from where I'm standing!\n\nSo sorry he is a \"phone it in \" parent! I would go no contact. He sent you a clear message as did your aunt!\n\nHuge healing hugs and happy juju flying your way!", "NTA.", "NTA\n\ni would take some space", "NTA\n\nHe made it sound like caring for you for 18 years was a terrible burden while caring for your cousin for only 3 years was a privilege", "I would not speak to him again. He clearly doesn't value you and resents that he had to take care of you. Save yourself the bs. NTA.", "NTA. Thanks to these stories, I now see why people go NC with family members and parents. Daddy wouldn't be getting a happy birthday wishes from me the next year.", "NTA. He may have had good reasons for helping out your cousin. Maybe she was in desperate shape financially and needed it more than you did because you were, with great effort and with lots of sacrifice, self sufficient.  But of course you are entitled to an explanation. Without explanation, it appeared that he wasn't supporting his own kid but was supporting someone else. It raises questions about betrayal and a lack of care and love.\n\nSo you were NTA to ask. Unfortunately, his answer sucked. He made is sound as though supporting you for 18 years was a legal obligation he disliked doing. You worked hard, there's no sign you were in any way spoiled or that you would be spoiled by some more money to ease the pressure. Your dad may just be a jerk who lacks the affection you deserve.", "NTA and I would ask him.", "NTA", "INFO How old was your cousin when they were receiving support?", "NTA.
