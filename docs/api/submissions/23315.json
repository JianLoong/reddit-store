She's been bad to many other people as well (including my whole family) but it has always seemed to me that she's had it out for me specifically. I don't know why she's behaving like this towards me, I can only speculate that it might be jealousy because I've been the academically successful one.  \nI've always tried co-existing with her, only interacting when necessary, but it didn't go too well.  \nI'll give you a few examples;  \n\n\n* when we still lived with our parents, I refused to let her use my printer because she yelled and insulted me an hour prior and when I did so, she lost it and threw a hot-water bottle at me.  \n\n* She called me and my whole family the c-word over a Wifi router.  \n\n* She called my mom the c-word and told her to shut the f up (which is just not normal in our family, not even saying \"shut your mouth\" is), after she refused to babysit her 2 bulldogs for over a week because 1) it stressed out our own dog and 2) she has to work and take care of my little sister and the household as well. Mind you, she had babysitted the dogs before for a day or two, but over a week because my sister wants to go on vacation with her boyfriend and the responsibility to care for  her dogs is in the way now, is too much.\n* And the most recent incident; (context: she did an apprenticeship as a mechanic) She heard something I said which could indicate that I was planning on being drunk and stuff (actually I was talking about Pok\u00e9monGo lmao, I rarely drink) and instead of asking me then and there, she went to my mom a week later and asked her if I have a problem with drinking. My mom, who is VERY sensible in regards to drinking because of a traumatic experience, called me and asked me about it. I said no and asked where my sister got that from and she said she didnt know, so I texted her about it and she immediately called me disrespectful, again insulted my personality and everything about me, pulled the\"you're uninvited to my wedding\" card (they got engaged a week prior) and lastly told me I should be careful that nothing is going to happen to me in my car (implying harming me indirectly by sabotaging my car), after which she blocked me. \n\nThen, she gave my mom an invitation for me and my bf (still blocked me though). I've had enough and I want to make a clear cut and not have her in my life anymore. I feel as if it'll never stop if I don't cut her out now and it will always go back and forth with this. She never apologizes, not to me, not to my mom or anyone else, she just pretends everything is back to normal and I dont want that to happen. \n\nEveryone is telling me they understand but I should go to keep the family peace.   \nI am not sure what to do. Would I be the a-hole?\n\n  \nThank you for the advice in advance!

Your family will get over it and if she goes NC out of anger, better for you, she just gave you exactly what you wanted. I married a guy outside of my family\u2019s religion so none of my family came to our wedding. Who cares? Been married 18 years, 3 kids, they love him now. Life goes on. If your family gives you grief, tell them you can\u2019t believe they are choosing her over you because that\u2019s what they are doing. You have to be decent and mature regardless of how she has abused you and the rest of the family and she has to be catered to. No way.", "NTA. Fuck the family peace. Be a cycle breaker. So many abusive assholes get away with insane behavior because those around them want to take the path of least resistance/maintain \u201cpeace\u201d/maintain appearances. Fuck that.

And also I don\u2019t think you should go because of all the reason you listed.", "You need to protect your peace, so no, you would not be the AH.  So, NTA.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nI hope you very seriously take into consideration the implications and consequences of your actions.  If you opt out of something so significant, you might alienate yourself from your whole family, and may irreversibly damage your relationship with your sister.  Your sister's behavior sounds awful, but both of you are still incredibly young and developing, and these may be some particularly challenging growing pains that may go away with maturity/time.  Burning this bridge could possibly sour your relationship permanently.\n\nIf you do decide to go no or low contact with her, maybe choosing her wedding day is not the best day to start?", "NTA. Your sister sounds horrible.  Good luck to her husband.  You should consider no contact", "I was in this situation with a family member and I still went to the wedding 'for the family '. I wish I hadn't as it was one of the most uncomfortable day I've ever had. I've since cut them off.\nNTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go, but you can also go knowing that she is marrying someone and becoming their problem now and see it as a sort of goodbye! In many cultures when the woman is married she joins the man\u2019s family lol. I realize it\u2019s not likely like that where you are but it would be hilarious to go with that mindset and talk that way. \u201cGood luck, she\u2019s your problem now\u201d\n\nNot to make excuses for her behavior and no guarantee this is her problem, but random side note: has she tried a gluten free diet? Surprisingly if you have celiacs that sort of behavior and attitude is actually a symptom even if she isn\u2019t showing the super physical ones. I know a couple people who did 180\u2019s on the bad attitude after going gluten free because their bodies response was to be awful angry people. Literally could just be her personality but it sounds like she needs some help one way or another.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get why people think that just because your family you have to tolerate someone treating you like shit.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, sounds like your family is going to roll over so accept the invitation and then oh no, day of the weddings your car breaks down/migrane/you fish has a food poisoning and ohhh nooo, what a tragedy.\n\nAfter that, she\u2019ll be the one cutting you off. Win-win.", "NTA , keep her out of your life , we only live once you do not need hatred and resentment from others in your life why put up with it until you die , skip the wedding go on a holiday instead", "NTA. Based on your post I can't think of a single reason why you should attend. \n\nHowever I guarantee a variation of the \" but she's your sister\" card will be played. This is a manipulation used when another family member who knows the other person is in the wrong and is unable to justify their actions.", "NTA\n\nJust ignore her. She's blocked you so it should be easy to do. She uninvited you to the wedding, so you're just going with what she said.\n\nPerhaps book a weekend away with your BF over the same weekend so that you have actual plans, to prevent any suggestion later that you can still come.\n\n'Sister uninvited us from the wedding, so we made other plans. Have fun.'", "NTA. She probably invited you because your absence would not go unnoticed by the other guests.", "NTA.\n\nAs appealing as \"killing her with kindness\" (going to the wedding & having a wonderful time) is, don't bother.   \n\n\n1. It's likely that the person she'll blow up at is you, and as an immediate family member you'll be forced into close contact with her throughout her \"special day\". \n2. Since your mom already knows the situation and understands, why bother? You're only asking for more drama. It sounds like you've had enough already!\n3. Book a vacation over that weekend somewhere (anywhere!) far away from the wedding's location since she's already uninvited you once & have a wonderful time doing whatever it is you want to do instead of prolonging your suffering.", "Nta. Decline and live your life. The only way to beat a narcissist is by completely ignoring them and living a happy life.", "Nta\nKeep peace. Your own peace of mind and don't interact with this person until they are ready to behave like grown ups. If your family gives you grief over it, remember that your relationship with your sister is nobody's issue but your own. It doesn't affect anyone else but you two.", "NTA if you don't want to go then don't go it's your choice she did this to herself it's not like there's any peace to keep.", "We can\u2019t pick our relatives, but we can chose not to be around them. Sound like she has mental issues. You can\u2019t fix that for her. Best to put up your boundaries now . There will be fallout from family members but it\u2019s going to be a shitshow either way. So do what is best for your mental health . Good luck.", "NTA, I would personally attend though as then she either has to be really nice to you which will probably hurt her feelings or be horrible and everyone will see her for who she is", "You both need to grow up, you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s now.\n\nYou both will eventually mature and you will regret not going.\n\nBe the bigger person and be there for your siblings special day.

Please cut her of your life and be careful for what she might do in response", "Don\u2019t go to \u201ckeep the peace \u201c, you\u2019re not the one disturbing it. NTA", "If I was you I would go. It will be the easiest choice. Then never talk to her again.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t but I also don\u2019t care much about stuff like that and burn bridges all the time", "NTA. She doesn't get to treat you like garbage and then expect you to pay \"nice family\" at a wedding, where and could *potentially* act like a monster in front of a larger audience. \n\nNo contact is a good idea. I would talk to your mom about it at some point though, so your sister can't try to get to you through your mom.", "Nta. Don\u2019t go. Stuff pretending you like her. Don\u2019t invite her to your potential future wedding either. Life\u2019s too short for bullshit", "Meh, go as a guest, buy her a wedding gift that doesn\u2019t cost much then stop giving her real estate in your head.   I suggest going and the git because yes, she will complain about whatever you do or don\u2019t do, but you can honestly say to anyone who  comments that you were at her wedding to celebrate her and you got her a gift that you could afford and surely they are not implying that you should go into debt?\n\nShe blocked you so you do\u2019t have to even pretend to reach out to her.  She obviously doesn\u2019t reach out to you.  On the times you have to interact with her, like at your mom\u2019s house, ignore her as much as possible.  When she starts slinging the insults you can look her straight in the eye then turn around and leave the room.  Or respond with (1) that is an interesting statement; (2) thank you I\u2019m sure you meant well; (3) Huh, you might be right; (4) whatever you came up with that is polite and sickeningly sweet.  Try to never respond with anger or words that she can complain about.  .\n\nThe trick is to not engage, and use words that will make her stupid if she complained about them.   I particularly like to use Thank you, I\u2019m sure you meant well, because I have thanked you for your opinion, and complimented you by acknowledging that you were intending to be helpful.   Even when everyone knows you were not.   The less reaction she gets from you the more angry she will get.  Everyone knows what she is like, lead the way with how to navigate her toxic personality.", "NTA, but I encourage you to go to the wedding. Here\u2019s why: \n\nEventually you\u2019re going to go NC with her, and you already know that. Going NC after the wedding will cause less of a rift between you and your family. Your family is encouraging you to go and be the bigger person. Going shows then you *are* the bigger person. Plus a lot of the time, you either don\u2019t even talk with the bride and groom, or you say one sentence to them. It could be fairly easy to distance yourself.\n\nSecondarily it\u2019ll piss your sister off if you go and have a fantastic time. She\u2019s likely inviting you because it looks bad not to, since that\u2019s classically something a narcissist would do. It\u2019ll leave her steaming to see you laughing and smiling and dancing and having a great time. \n\nLastly, If she\u2019s that self centered, she\u2019s likely to have at least one meltdown at someone during the wedding. Might just be interesting to watch, or it could be at you and give you something to make that moment the breaking point for NC - loudly in front of everyone, which would make her even angrier because she would feel like you stole her day.\n\nEdited to add: she can\u2019t play the victim card if you go. Otherwise she will. \u201cOhh I tried to mend the fences but my sister just won\u2019t! Feel bad for me!!!\u201d", "NTA. An invitation isn't a summons.", "Cool thing about getting older is that generally you\u2019re not forced to do things or be with people when you don\u2019t want to. Since you\u2019re no longer living with your sister, you shouldn\u2019t feel the level of tension a relationship with her used to bring. It\u2019s also easy to back away slowly until there is zero tension. \nI\u2019d go to the wedding. Sounds like you\u2019re a guest with no responsibilities other than having a good time with some people you care about. Pose for some pictures. Get your sister a nice gift. It will be a nice dress up date for you and your bf (cool of her to invite him too). \nAfter the wedding, it can be whatever. See you at Christmas or New Years maybe. It\u2019s remarkably easy to handle a once or twice a year face to face relationship. \nMost people change a lot in their 20s. Life gets different when you have your own responsibilities. Hopefully she becomes cooler. Just be yourself and be cool.", "NTA.  F the family peace.  There hasn't been family peace since your sister came into the world.  Step back from your family for a while if they can't respect your wishes.", "'Keep the family peace' is such a load of bullshit, I hate when families hold each other hostage with stupid notions like that. \n\nNTA, your sister sucks.", "Simple, do not attend.", "Gift her a box of coal and leave a note telling her she\u2019s an egotistic, narcissistic, self centered monster she is that deserves it.", "NTA. In the long run it'll be better for you not to go. Good for her to see her actions have consequences, good for you to know the feeling of standing up for yourself.", "NTA there is no family pesce to keep. I don't understand why people think there is. Your sister decided there would be no family peace a long time ago. Don't go to the wedding. It's not something you'll enjoy doing, so why bother? And since you won't be going there's no need to send a gift. Oh look money saved!", "Don't go. You are the Nta.", "NTA but I would recommend getting ahead of the family fall out by discussing with the rest of your family why you would rather not go. \nAlternatively invent an excuse along the lines of...oh sorry my work is sending me out of town that day... and send her a $25 gift certificate for Walmart or something as your wedding gift.", "NTA. She clearly has some serious anger issues. You should have a talk about this with your mom and the rest of the family. Maybe she\u2019s been in some bullshit that you don\u2019t know about, she should definitely see a therapist and get some help. If you don\u2019t want to go to the wedding, then don\u2019t, that\u2019s up to you and the rest of your family will probably understand.", "NTA\n\nShe probably doesn't actually want you there anyway.", "NTA \n\nDo not go please", "NTA! There is no reason you need to force yourself to go to her wedding to celebrate her. She clearly doesn't give 2 shits about you and threatened your life. That is NOT HOW A SISTER IS SUPPOSED TO TREAT YOU. She is toxic at best and a narcissistic criminal possibly.\n\nAll these people who are telling you to go to the wedding, don't listen to them. You clearly laid out many reasons why you shouldn't need to go. Your mother probably forced her to invite you because \"how would it look to the family\". That is NOT your problem, she doesn't even make you feel like you are part of her family.\n\nYou should post on social media \"Can someone please tell my sister that I am not going to her wedding?

It may be a smoother path if you go and then block her and go full NC after.", "Yes, cut her out now. I learned too late. My female sibling is 6 yrs older and in retirement age. I went NC 15 years ago and she still infiltrates my life. Shes blocked from all but still can somehow leave disgusting messages . Her mission in life is to take me down.  No reason other jealousy.

I don't know why she's behaving like this towards me, I can only speculate that it might be jealousy because I've been the academically successful one.  \nI've always tried co-existing with her, only interacting when necessary, but it didn't go too well.  \nI'll give you a few examples;  \n\n\n* when we still lived with our parents, I refused to let her use my printer because she yelled and insulted me an hour prior and when I did so, she lost it and threw a hot-water bottle at me.  \n\n* She called me and my whole family the c-word over a Wifi router.  \n\n* She called my mom the c-word and told her to shut the f up (which is just not normal in our family, not even saying \"shut your mouth\" is), after she refused to babysit her 2 bulldogs for over a week because 1) it stressed out our own dog and 2) she has to work and take care of my little sister and the household as well. Mind you, she had babysitted the dogs before for a day or two, but over a week because my sister wants to go on vacation with her boyfriend and the responsibility to care for  her dogs is in the way now, is too much.\n* And the most recent incident; (context: she did an apprenticeship as a mechanic) She heard something I said which could indicate that I was planning on being drunk and stuff (actually I was talking about Pok\u00e9monGo lmao, I rarely drink) and instead of asking me then and there, she went to my mom a week later and asked her if I have a problem with drinking. My mom, who is VERY sensible in regards to drinking because of a traumatic experience, called me and asked me about it. I said no and asked where my sister got that from and she said she didnt know, so I texted her about it and she immediately called me disrespectful, again insulted my personality and everything about me, pulled the\"you're uninvited to my wedding\" card (they got engaged a week prior) and lastly told me I should be careful that nothing is going to happen to me in my car (implying harming me indirectly by sabotaging my car), after which she blocked me. \n\nThen, she gave my mom an invitation for me and my bf (still blocked me though). I've had enough and I want to make a clear cut and not have her in my life anymore. I feel as if it'll never stop if I don't cut her out now and it will always go back and forth with this. She never apologizes, not to me, not to my mom or anyone else, she just pretends everything is back to normal and I dont want that to happen. \n\nEveryone is telling me they understand but I should go to keep the family peace.   \nI am not sure what to do.

Surely, the family agrees that the sister is a witch (and not the good kind), but are likely trying to keep it together to get her 'away' to her own house where maybe she will grow up a little (or get the psychiatric attention it sounds like she needs).\n\n'Being the better person' is just one way of thinking about it, OP -- you have to decide what is best for you and only you.  If it means more to you to visibly cut her off (and not-appearing in wedding photos is a very obvious way to do that, with the family and all guests aware of it should it become the thing to talk about -- and who doesn't love wedding gossip?), then do it, and never agree to speak to her again.\n\nBut in the longer view, it might give you better standing to do what you've already been doing, which is to co-exist, but minimally so, and vow to have a good time at the wedding despite her.  Like the old saying \"the best revenge is a life well lived,\" which means OP, you decide what 'well lived' means to you.\n\nIf you take the 'visibly better person' path, just know that I tip my hat to you, because I know from experience how much it sucks to take that role on.  The narcissistic / mentally ill people you deal with do their best to make everything all about them, which is exhausting, and they have zero awareness of how toxic they are to everyone.

Try to avoid descending into tit for tat playground behaviour (your sister seems to enjoy \"poking the bear with a stick\" and the resulting drama, \"emotional regulation problems\", maybe). In any case, you may want to do something like attend the ceremony (IF that will make parents you care a lot about less miserable) and then skip the reception (which is when sister would have the opportunity to make a scene) or duck out way early. These sorts of family \"command appearances\" are problematic for everyone, our parents generation was programmed to believe problems within the family mean they failed as parents and you will have to sort out which relationships are worth the effort to preserve and nurture. Keep in mind that if you want to keep a relationship with your parents you can't put them in a position where they have to choose between their kids, but you do want to ally with them in drawing boundaries around your sisters behaviour. On the other hand, if your parents are part of the problem, and you are completely financially independant, you may want to go low or no contact with the whole lot of them.", "NTA OP.

It doesn\u2019t sound like your family has peace - thanks to your sister. \n\nShe\u2019s a brat and she wants attention. Like you said, she\u2019s a narcissist. That behaviour doesn\u2019t change. Walk away. It\u2019ll be the best decision you can make.", "Honestly, this is likely her way of keeping the family off her back- she can't outright not invite OP or the family will throw a shit fit so she's extending an invitation she knows OP won't take. \n\nThe invite is for show- she doesn't actually want OP to attend and her behavior if OP does will reflect this,", "Yup.
