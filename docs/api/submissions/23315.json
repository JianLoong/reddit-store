She's been bad to many other people as well (including my whole family) but it has always seemed to me that she's had it out for me specifically. I don't know why she's behaving like this towards me, I can only speculate that it might be jealousy because I've been the academically successful one.  \nI've always tried co-existing with her, only interacting when necessary, but it didn't go too well.  \nI'll give you a few examples;  \n\n\n* when we still lived with our parents, I refused to let her use my printer because she yelled and insulted me an hour prior and when I did so, she lost it and threw a hot-water bottle at me.  \n\n* She called me and my whole family the c-word over a Wifi router.  \n\n* She called my mom the c-word and told her to shut the f up (which is just not normal in our family, not even saying \"shut your mouth\" is), after she refused to babysit her 2 bulldogs for over a week because 1) it stressed out our own dog and 2) she has to work and take care of my little sister and the household as well. Mind you, she had babysitted the dogs before for a day or two, but over a week because my sister wants to go on vacation with her boyfriend and the responsibility to care for  her dogs is in the way now, is too much.\n* And the most recent incident; (context: she did an apprenticeship as a mechanic) She heard something I said which could indicate that I was planning on being drunk and stuff (actually I was talking about Pok\u00e9monGo lmao, I rarely drink) and instead of asking me then and there, she went to my mom a week later and asked her if I have a problem with drinking. My mom, who is VERY sensible in regards to drinking because of a traumatic experience, called me and asked me about it. I said no and asked where my sister got that from and she said she didnt know, so I texted her about it and she immediately called me disrespectful, again insulted my personality and everything about me, pulled the\"you're uninvited to my wedding\" card (they got engaged a week prior) and lastly told me I should be careful that nothing is going to happen to me in my car (implying harming me indirectly by sabotaging my car), after which she blocked me. \n\nThen, she gave my mom an invitation for me and my bf (still blocked me though). I've had enough and I want to make a clear cut and not have her in my life anymore. I feel as if it'll never stop if I don't cut her out now and it will always go back and forth with this. She never apologizes, not to me, not to my mom or anyone else, she just pretends everything is back to normal and I dont want that to happen. \n\nEveryone is telling me they understand but I should go to keep the family peace.   \nI am not sure what to do. Would I be the a-hole?\n\n  \nThank you for the advice in advance!

Your family will get over it and if she goes NC out of anger, better for you, she just gave you exactly what you wanted. I married a guy outside of my family\u2019s religion so none of my family came to our wedding. Who cares? Been married 18 years, 3 kids, they love him now. Life goes on. If your family gives you grief, tell them you can\u2019t believe they are choosing her over you because that\u2019s what they are doing. You have to be decent and mature regardless of how she has abused you and the rest of the family and she has to be catered to. No way.", "NTA. Fuck the family peace. Be a cycle breaker. So many abusive assholes get away with insane behavior because those around them want to take the path of least resistance/maintain \u201cpeace\u201d/maintain appearances. Fuck that.

And also I don\u2019t think you should go because of all the reason you listed.", "You need to protect your peace, so no, you would not be the AH.  So, NTA.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nI hope you very seriously take into consideration the implications and consequences of your actions.  If you opt out of something so significant, you might alienate yourself from your whole family, and may irreversibly damage your relationship with your sister.  Your sister's behavior sounds awful, but both of you are still incredibly young and developing, and these may be some particularly challenging growing pains that may go away with maturity/time.  Burning this bridge could possibly sour your relationship permanently.\n\nIf you do decide to go no or low contact with her, maybe choosing her wedding day is not the best day to start?", "NTA. Your sister sounds horrible.  Good luck to her husband.  You should consider no contact", "I was in this situation with a family member and I still went to the wedding 'for the family '. I wish I hadn't as it was one of the most uncomfortable day I've ever had. I've since cut them off.\nNTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go, but you can also go knowing that she is marrying someone and becoming their problem now and see it as a sort of goodbye! In many cultures when the woman is married she joins the man\u2019s family lol. I realize it\u2019s not likely like that where you are but it would be hilarious to go with that mindset and talk that way. \u201cGood luck, she\u2019s your problem now\u201d\n\nNot to make excuses for her behavior and no guarantee this is her problem, but random side note: has she tried a gluten free diet? Surprisingly if you have celiacs that sort of behavior and attitude is actually a symptom even if she isn\u2019t showing the super physical ones. I know a couple people who did 180\u2019s on the bad attitude after going gluten free because their bodies response was to be awful angry people. Literally could just be her personality but it sounds like she needs some help one way or another.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get why people think that just because your family you have to tolerate someone treating you like shit.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, sounds like your family is going to roll over so accept the invitation and then oh no, day of the weddings your car breaks down/migrane/you fish has a food poisoning and ohhh nooo, what a tragedy.\n\nAfter that, she\u2019ll be the one cutting you off. Win-win.", "NTA , keep her out of your life , we only live once you do not need hatred and resentment from others in your life why put up with it until you die , skip the wedding go on a holiday instead", "NTA. Based on your post I can't think of a single reason why you should attend. \n\nHowever I guarantee a variation of the \" but she's your sister\" card will be played. This is a manipulation used when another family member who knows the other person is in the wrong and is unable to justify their actions.", "NTA\n\nJust ignore her. She's blocked you so it should be easy to do. She uninvited you to the wedding, so you're just going with what she said.\n\nPerhaps book a weekend away with your BF over the same weekend so that you have actual plans, to prevent any suggestion later that you can still come.\n\n'Sister uninvited us from the wedding, so we made other plans. Have fun.'", "NTA. She probably invited you because your absence would not go unnoticed by the other guests.", "NTA.\n\nAs appealing as \"killing her with kindness\" (going to the wedding & having a wonderful time) is, don't bother.   \n\n\n1. It's likely that the person she'll blow up at is you, and as an immediate family member you'll be forced into close contact with her throughout her \"special day\". \n2. Since your mom already knows the situation and understands, why bother? You're only asking for more drama. It sounds like you've had enough already!\n3. Book a vacation over that weekend somewhere (anywhere!) far away from the wedding's location since she's already uninvited you once & have a wonderful time doing whatever it is you want to do instead of prolonging your suffering.", "Nta. Decline and live your life. The only way to beat a narcissist is by completely ignoring them and living a happy life.", "Nta\nKeep peace. Your own peace of mind and don't interact with this person until they are ready to behave like grown ups. If your family gives you grief over it, remember that your relationship with your sister is nobody's issue but your own. It doesn't affect anyone else but you two.", "NTA if you don't want to go then don't go it's your choice she did this to herself it's not like there's any peace to keep.", "We can\u2019t pick our relatives, but we can chose not to be around them. Sound like she has mental issues. You can\u2019t fix that for her. Best to put up your boundaries now . There will be fallout from family members but it\u2019s going to be a shitshow either way. So do what is best for your mental health . Good luck.", "NTA, I would personally attend though as then she either has to be really nice to you which will probably hurt her feelings or be horrible and everyone will see her for who she is", "You both need to grow up, you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s now.\n\nYou both will eventually mature and you will regret not going.\n\nBe the bigger person and be there for your siblings special day.

Please cut her of your life and be careful for what she might do in response", "Don\u2019t go to \u201ckeep the peace \u201c, you\u2019re not the one disturbing it. NTA", "If I was you I would go. It will be the easiest choice. Then never talk to her again.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t but I also don\u2019t care much about stuff like that and burn bridges all the time", "NTA. She doesn't get to treat you like garbage and then expect you to pay \"nice family\" at a wedding, where and could *potentially* act like a monster in front of a larger audience. \n\nNo contact is a good idea. I would talk to your mom about it at some point though, so your sister can't try to get to you through your mom.", "Nta. Don\u2019t go. Stuff pretending you like her. Don\u2019t invite her to your potential future wedding either. Life\u2019s too short for bullshit", "Meh, go as a guest, buy her a wedding gift that doesn\u2019t cost much then stop giving her real estate in your head.   I suggest going and the git because yes, she will complain about whatever you do or don\u2019t do, but you can honestly say to anyone who  comments that you were at her wedding to celebrate her and you got her a gift that you could afford and surely they are not implying that you should go into debt?\n\nShe blocked you so you do\u2019t have to even pretend to reach out to her.  She obviously doesn\u2019t reach out to you.  On the times you have to interact with her, like at your mom\u2019s house, ignore her as much as possible.  When she starts slinging the insults you can look her straight in the eye then turn around and leave the room.  Or respond with (1) that is an interesting statement; (2) thank you I\u2019m sure you meant well; (3) Huh, you might be right; (4) whatever you came up with that is polite and sickeningly sweet.  Try to never respond with anger or words that she can complain about.  .\n\nThe trick is to not engage, and use words that will make her stupid if she complained about them.   I particularly like to use Thank you, I\u2019m sure you meant well, because I have thanked you for your opinion, and complimented you by acknowledging that you were intending to be helpful.   Even when everyone knows you were not.   The less reaction she gets from you the more angry she will get.  Everyone knows what she is like, lead the way with how to navigate her toxic personality.", "NTA, but I encourage you to go to the wedding. Here\u2019s why: \n\nEventually you\u2019re going to go NC with her, and you already know that. Going NC after the wedding will cause less of a rift between you and your family. Your family is encouraging you to go and be the bigger person. Going shows then you *are* the bigger person. Plus a lot of the time, you either don\u2019t even talk with the bride and groom, or you say one sentence to them. It could be fairly easy to distance yourself.\n\nSecondarily it\u2019ll piss your sister off if you go and have a fantastic time. She\u2019s likely inviting you because it looks bad not to, since that\u2019s classically something a narcissist would do. It\u2019ll leave her steaming to see you laughing and smiling and dancing and having a great time. \n\nLastly, If she\u2019s that self centered, she\u2019s likely to have at least one meltdown at someone during the wedding. Might just be interesting to watch, or it could be at you and give you something to make that moment the breaking point for NC - loudly in front of everyone, which would make her even angrier because she would feel like you stole her day.", "NTA. An invitation isn't a summons.", "Cool thing about getting older is that generally you\u2019re not forced to do things or be with people when you don\u2019t want to. Since you\u2019re no longer living with your sister, you shouldn\u2019t feel the level of tension a relationship with her used to bring. It\u2019s also easy to back away slowly until there is zero tension. \nI\u2019d go to the wedding. Sounds like you\u2019re a guest with no responsibilities other than having a good time with some people you care about. Pose for some pictures. Get your sister a nice gift. It will be a nice dress up date for you and your bf (cool of her to invite him too). \nAfter the wedding, it can be whatever. See you at Christmas or New Years maybe. It\u2019s remarkably easy to handle a once or twice a year face to face relationship. \nMost people change a lot in their 20s. Life gets different when you have your own responsibilities. Hopefully she becomes cooler. Just be yourself and be cool.", "NTA.  F the family peace.  There hasn't been family peace since your sister came into the world.  Step back from your family for a while if they can't respect your wishes.", "'Keep the family peace' is such a load of bullshit, I hate when families hold each other hostage with stupid notions like that. \n\nNTA, your sister sucks.", "Simple, do not attend.", "Gift her a box of coal and leave a note telling her she\u2019s an egotistic, narcissistic, self centered monster she is that deserves it.", "NTA. In the long run it'll be better for you not to go. Good for her to see her actions have consequences, good for you to know the feeling of standing up for yourself.", "NTA there is no family pesce to keep. I don't understand why people think there is. Your sister decided there would be no family peace a long time ago. Don't go to the wedding. It's not something you'll enjoy doing, so why bother? And since you won't be going there's no need to send a gift. Oh look money saved!", "Don't go. You are the Nta.", "NTA but I would recommend getting ahead of the family fall out by discussing with the rest of your family why you would rather not go. \nAlternatively invent an excuse along the lines of...oh sorry my work is sending me out of town that day... and send her a $25 gift certificate for Walmart or something as your wedding gift.", "NTA. She clearly has some serious anger issues. You should have a talk about this with your mom and the rest of the family. Maybe she\u2019s been in some bullshit that you don\u2019t know about, she should definitely see a therapist and get some help. If you don\u2019t want to go to the wedding, then don\u2019t, that\u2019s up to you and the rest of your family will probably understand.", "NTA\n\nShe probably doesn't actually want you there anyway.", "NTA \n\nDo not go please", "NTA! There is no reason you need to force yourself to go to her wedding to celebrate her. She clearly doesn't give 2 shits about you and threatened your life. That is NOT HOW A SISTER IS SUPPOSED TO TREAT YOU. She is toxic at best and a narcissistic criminal possibly.\n\nAll these people who are telling you to go to the wedding, don't listen to them. You clearly laid out many reasons why you shouldn't need to go. Your mother probably forced her to invite you because \"how would it look to the family\". That is NOT your problem, she doesn't even make you feel like you are part of her family.\n\nYou should post on social media \"Can someone please tell my sister that I am not going to her wedding?

It may be a smoother path if you go and then block her and go full NC after.", "Yes, cut her out now. I learned too late. My female sibling is 6 yrs older and in retirement age. I went NC 15 years ago and she still infiltrates my life. Shes blocked from all but still can somehow leave disgusting messages . Her mission in life is to take me down.  No reason other jealousy.

Mind you, she had babysitted the dogs before for a day or two, but over a week because my sister wants to go on vacation with her boyfriend and the responsibility to care for  her dogs is in the way now, is too much.\n* And the most recent incident; (context: she did an apprenticeship as a mechanic) She heard something I said which could indicate that I was planning on being drunk and stuff (actually I was talking about Pok\u00e9monGo lmao, I rarely drink) and instead of asking me then and there, she went to my mom a week later and asked her if I have a problem with drinking. My mom, who is VERY sensible in regards to drinking because of a traumatic experience, called me and asked me about it. I said no and asked where my sister got that from and she said she didnt know, so I texted her about it and she immediately called me disrespectful, again insulted my personality and everything about me, pulled the\"you're uninvited to my wedding\" card (they got engaged a week prior) and lastly told me I should be careful that nothing is going to happen to me in my car (implying harming me indirectly by sabotaging my car), after which she blocked me. \n\nThen, she gave my mom an invitation for me and my bf (still blocked me though). I've had enough and I want to make a clear cut and not have her in my life anymore. I feel as if it'll never stop if I don't cut her out now and it will always go back and forth with this. She never apologizes, not to me, not to my mom or anyone else, she just pretends everything is back to normal and I dont want that to happen. \n\nEveryone is telling me they understand but I should go to keep the family peace.   \nI am not sure what to do.

Tbh I would be petty enough to say that I tried to rsvp but she must have not gotten it as she must have blocked me", "At first, I was going to say just go to the wedding. But she uninvited you. That's all you need. No flip-flopping. And the threat that she'll damage your car??? \nCan't pick your family.  Your parents need to do better. They should not have allowed that kind of egregiously bad behavior. \ud83d\ude12 \nNTA", "Go, wear a fantastic dress, but nothing that resembles a wedding dress.

During her wedding!", "NTA, she can go kick rocks", "NTA \n\nThere is literally no peace to keep here by going.", "NTA it seems like going no contact is best", "NTA", "Hahaha that made me laugh, thank u !", "I doubt that we'd ever have a better relationship sadly. She's been like this for as long as I can remember, meaning it's definitely been well over a decade of that behavior and she's never once apologized for anything, so even if we're not fully matured yet, im 99% sure that the maturing we have left to do won't magically cause her to change her behavior and even if she did, everything she's done to me did leave a mark (if that makes sense)", "Do a google search for your car with a flat tyre and use the image rename it so it fits with how your phone does photos send them the shot when your running late.", "Exactly, so far it's mostly been \"you should attend out of decency\" and \"to keep the family peace\" but why? She hasn't been the slightest bit decent to me, why should I?   \n\n\nBut the comments made me doubt myself so I decided to get some third-party feedback.  \nThank you!", "Good idea! I'll still have Semester holidays, so it should be possible :)", "That's what I thought as well.   \nAnd maybe because she wants me to attend, just to feed her ego even more. Idk though. :/", "This is such horrible advice, you do not need to be the 'bigger person' when the other person is downright ABUSIVE.\n\nNTA OP, you need to take the route that will ensure your happiness and to me it doesn't sound like your sister is on it.", "I know I'm only 20 and I've got a lot of maturing to do, certainly, but I'm tired of being the \"bigger person\". I've had to be it a lot at all the family gatherings where she'd always low-key (but enough to notice) passive aggressively make comments and just small things like that, which I've always ignored for the sake of peace. \n\nI've let many people walk over me when I was younger and now, for like 3 maybe 4 years, I've become a person who stands up for herself and I'm tired of being the bigger person and sacrificing my \"inner peace\" for this whole thing. \n\nMy mom has tried since we were teenagers to keep her in check with the respect and decency etc but it never helped. She hasn't changed and only become worse towards me, so I sadly doubt that it'll change, even if I wish it did", "No F\\*\\*\\* this c\\*\\*\\*.\n\nYou are extremely naive if you believe the sister will change. She MAY change. Most likely won't.", "Just because someone is related to you, does not mean you have to put up with their abuse. Family should treat you BETTER than everyone else in the world.

When my family ran out of weddings there was a gap where no one saw each other. Now we only catch up at funerals. It\u2019s sad. Enjoy the other people at the wedding, avoid the bride, then enjoy your new low drama NC lifestyle.", "Thank you! I've talked to my mother and she does understand me. She just had problems with her brother and parents and hates to see the same happening to her daughters, but she still understands. And kinda yes, my mom thinks that her fianc\u00e9 convinced her to send the invite because he is \"on my side\" ( he told her it was wrong ) regarding the threatening me stuff. Idk how he puts up with her but I'm thankful he does.", "Glad to hear you've gotten over it! And it's nice to know that someone relates :)", "Exactly. I'd probably wear the wrong dress, eat the cake wrongly or look at her the wring way. That's what I'm concerned about and one of the reasons against going for me", "True.   \nFor me it'd be a good clear cut and she would know as well, but the downside it the feedback I'd get from my family. My step-dad, who has had problems with her as well because she doesn't respect him and plays the \"youre not my dad\" card easily, even said to attend out of decency.   \nI also kind of dont want to attend because 1) i refuse to spend money on her and 2) I'd \"do something wrong\" anyways and don't want to get blamed for something", "That would be the only reason I'd go to the wedding, because my mom means a lot to me and we have a wonderful relationship.\n\nI don't feel as though I am making it a big deal, I just don't want to attend. She has made it a big deal when I confronted her about her behavior and started this whole Situation when she uninvited me and threatened me. I'm trying to keep my peace while not disturbing the family peace too much, but it's probably not going to turn out as I wish it would.", "Sounds like it would be a relief to OP to have sis out of her life anyway!", "Yeah, my mom took her house keys because of that. \nShe lives with her bf and I live with mine, we were allowed to keep the house keys for my parents house to always be able to go to them.

The boomerang effect is exactly what I'm worried about !", "Exactly sister just made it so she can tell everyone OP did get an invite so it\u2019s her fault if she doesn\u2019t go. Manipulative shit!", "Glad to help. She sounds like a bin fire of a human.", "If your sister wants family peace, she can talk to you and invite you", "Are you married or engaged?", "So just weigh those two against the family feedback, but know NC will be the eventual outcome whether you go or stay.  Also, if you rsvp no, that 'feedback' will start sooner, and if you don't, you will have wasted a place setting, and that may result in more bullying.\n\nYou can also slip out super early. As you are going NC, you can forget about the gift too.", "Your sister doesn't do anything out of decency, and she threw away the family peace a long time ago.
