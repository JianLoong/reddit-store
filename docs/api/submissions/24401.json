So, I recently adopted this adorable small dog named Luna who was previously abused by her owner. Luna's still quite skittish, especially around loud noises and unfamiliar people.\n\nHere's where the dilemma comes in: My neighbor (40sF) has this infuriating habit of getting drunk and chain-smoking in my driveway every Tuesday night. Not only does it reek up the place, but the smoke also seems to trigger Luna's anxiety, causing her to cower and shake.\n\nLast week, after having enough, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought 5 lbs of American strong cheddar cheese and placed it strategically near my neighbor's usual smoking spot in the driveway. My idea was that the pungent smell of the cheese would make her think twice about lighting up there, giving Luna some relief from the smoke.\n\nWell, the plan worked... maybe a bit too well. My neighbor came out, saw the cheese, and ended up tripping over it while trying to reach for her pack of cigarettes. She fell, cussing and yelling, and I could tell she was pretty intoxicated. She ended up with a scraped knee and some minor bruises.\n\nShe later confronted me, accusing me of deliberately setting a cheese trap to hurt her. I explained that it was more about protecting my anxious dog from the smoke, but she wasn't having it. Now, she's upset with me, and I can sense some hostility between us.\n\nAITA for using the cheddar cheese or nah?\n\n\nUpdate: I have asked her to stop before in the past.
