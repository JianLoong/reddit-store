I never got to know her well, as I was about to move out when we met. My sister (20F) still lives between our parents and likes Paula, but finds her annoying.\n\nPaula has an odd attitude towards pregnancy. It became the most obvious when my cousin announced she was expecting back in 2021. Her daughter would be the first great-grandchild. We hadn't been sure my grandma would be around for that. And after an emotional announcement in which everyone was overjoyed, Paula commented that she felt it wasn't a big deal, and \"didn't get what all the fuss was about\".\n\nShe kept that stance for all 9 months. But once the baby was born, Paula suddenly became a bit too interested in her, which my cousin was clearly uncomfortable with.\n\nMy husband (28M) and I announced our pregnancy earlier this year. At first, my father was over the moon. Since this is his first grandchild, I believed that would last.\n\nBut as I heard from my sister, Paula was just as condescending as we expected, if not more. Whenever I announced anything about my pregnancy or baby (sex, first kicks, ultrasound pictures, etc.), Paula always reacted with one of 3 phrases: \"okay\"; \"that's not that big a deal\"; or \"is that all she talks about these days?\".\n\nI didn't care about it at first. But after a few weeks, I started to notice my father was also losing any interest he had in my pregnancy. As the months went by, he became increasingly detached and standoffish. He started to either ignore or not pay attention to most of the updates I made on my baby. He also didn't come to our \"name reveal\" (we did that instead of a gender reveal; it was literally just a lunch party with a game we made up) or the baby shower because, and I quote, \"Paula doesn't think it's worth it\".\n\nMy son was born on Halloween, and I decided not to tell my father and Paula. After almost nine months of excuses and disinterest, I didn't see any reason to. I was in the hospital for 4 days, during which only mine and my husband's closest friends and family visited us.\n\nThe day before we left, I posted a picture of my son on Instagram, and that's when my father found out. He called to ask why I hadn't told him and Paula or invited them to meet my baby. I didn't lie: they didn't make any efforts to get involved (both emotionally and physically) during my pregnancy, so they'd have to wait for baby news like everybody else.\n\nMy father and Paula are furious, accusing me of using my son as a pawn and keeping them away out of pettiness.They're saying I'm holding the fact that they \"missed a few dumb parties\" against them.\n\nMy husband and pretty much my whole family agrees with me. My sister, while mostly on my side, still thinks I should have told my father, since this is his first grandchild and he had to find out he was born through social media. She thinks this is all Paula's fault and I should apologize to our dad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699374737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17py7re/aita_for_not_telling_my_father_and_stepmother/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to be willing to do his part as well and express interest and participate.\n\nAnd no, it isn't about showing up to parties.  It is about making the effort to be included when you are invited to be and not dismiss those invitations as if they are meaningless.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants a grandchild he needs to start acting like a father first. And he's not. He wasn't interested then, so why should he be now.", "What gets me is that she has gotten interested afterward, suggesting something. Maybe it is time to have a sit down talk with your father because obviously something is going on. Mayne she can not get pregnant herself and is jealous. NTA but this probably goes deeper then you know.", "NTA. All of the ESH replies are dumb as hell. Paula has your dad twirled around her finger. The only two in-person baby events that you had, they didn't show up, and your dad was standoffish for the majority of your pregnancy due to Paula. He is a grown-ass man. He doesn't get to all of a sudden meet and be involved in his first grandchild's life when he barely cared before. Guaranteed he only wanted to come to the hospital for photos and to post on social media and show off. Apologizing to your dad will not do anything, but only enable his BS. He needs to step up, put his foot down to Paula, and show you that he genuinely and actively wants to be a part of your immediate family's life. Your dad can be updated via social media until he gets his face out of his behind and acts like an actual father.", "NTA. They didn't miss \"dumb\" parties, to us parents those family gatherings are very important. He made his choice when he followed along with Paula's negative ass.", "NTA Your dad didn\u2019t only miss your pregnancy milestones, he failed to be a supportive father to you during your first pregnancy. He treated your pregnancy as unimportant, whether because he was influenced by Paula or not doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s a grown ass man and if he lets her control how he feels about his grandchild and how he supports his child then he doesn\u2019t need to be around the baby or know anything. I have a feeling Paula is jealous of anyone else getting attention and I wouldn\u2019t trust her around your son from what you said about how she acted with cousins baby.", "OPs Dad and Paula thought it was no big deal, so that's how OP played it.  I hope OPs Dad realises what an idiot he was being and starts thinking for himself rather than parroting Paula.

Let your Dad and Paula be mad; let them play dumb and act like they didn\u2019t do anything rude or dismissive during your pregnancy.  You don\u2019t have to be unfailing kind for forever, and you definitely don\u2019t need to feel bad now that they are upset that their actions reaped consequences.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not like you have tried to exclude Paula from your life.  Her issues are clearly *all about her*, not about poor treatments from her husband\u2019s daughters.  I\u2019m sure Paula has all kind of insecurities due to marrying a man 20 years older than her, but that\u2019s not your fault, and if your father is willing to let her drag him down into the muck with her, well that is his choice and these are the consequences.", "NTA\n\nHe made it clear how uninteresting he found the baby.", "NTA!

Don't let her poison your relationship without your dad.", "NTA. Paula is 38, and your dad is 59. That is a huge age gap. At the time when she got married, she may have decided she didn't want kids. And being in love with your dad, with that huge age gap, was her way of justifying her decision. But now, with all the recent pregnancies, she could be regretting her decision. And is even starting to resent her choice, you, your cousin, and even your dad because of his age. There may be deeper issues at play here. She may have brought this up to your dad that she changed her mind. But he could have said no. Instead of arguing, she took the passive-aggressive attitude towards those with babies. You may want to reconsider cutting them out of your life. Congrats on your new baby!", "NTA, and DO NOT apologize.\n\nYour dad is the asshole.  Paula is too, but it is your dad who let himself be affected by her.\n\n\"Dad, maybe I should have told you, but I didn't because every time I talked to you while I was pregnant, I felt rejected and made to feel small.  I know Paula has some kind of mental illness around pregnancy and birth, but you let her change your experience of this baby, and it was sucking all the joy out this huge, happy event in my life for me.  You don't seem to understand that you became weird and sad.  Do you really blame me for wanting to be with people who are happy for me and with me?\n\n\"I'm not sure how we can go forward from here.  Being a mother is now who I am.  Paula can't make that go away, and I don't want anyone around who acts like my baby isn't important.  It will just hurt me and hurt my son.  I guess the ball is in your court.  You need to figure out if you want to be an involved grandpa or just another of the extended family I don't stay in close contact with.", "NTA. It was your fathers choice not to show up and you step moms choice to be such a drag/nuisance throughout your pregnancy.  You were pregnant, the last thing that should\u2019ve been on your mind was other peoples BS reasons and actions for behaving like petulant children. Looking at your other comments I can see that you AND you sister even tried to breakthrough to your Dad but he was unwilling to listen/change. \n\nYes, you could have sent them an update\u2026which based on prior experience would have been received with an \u2018ok\u2019 \u2018why does this matter\u2019 or \u2018gosh, now the baby really is all she\u2019ll talk about\u2019. And after hearing that for months, with no attempt to shut down Paula, it\u2019s not surprising you didn\u2019t contact them. I wouldn\u2019t want that energy around me in postpartum nor my newborn child. \n\nPaula and your Dad needed a reality check and hopefully this works out. If not, it\u2019ll be on your Dad and Paula to fix it.", "NTA \n\nI also don't think you owe your father an apology. His behavior was terrible. He is unreasonable to be upset with you after being dismissive for 8 months.", "NTA. \n\nThey showed indifference about the pregnancy.  You matched their energy about the birth.", "NTA, as the saying goes, you reap what you sow. They didn\u2019t care for the baby during your pregnancy so you decided to not involve them in its birth/life. Seems fair to me. I wouldn\u2019t even feel guilty about it. Even if it\u2019s pure pettiness, I endorse it.", "NTA. \n\nWhen's the last time your father initiated a conversation to ask you how you were and how your pregnancy was? He undoubtedly was told of the due date at some point, did he not check in just before?  That's the bare minimum for someone with even a passing interest in your life. Yet they're still calling your parties \"dumb\"? They chose their level of engagement, you are merely respecting their choice.\n\nIf they bother to contact you again and want to talk about the baby, simply reply with \"Okay, that's not that big a deal. Is that all you talk about these days?\"", "NTA, he wasn't interested through your whole pregnancy so why bother telling him. I know your sister says that it's all Paula's fault but he's a grown man and can make his own decisions.", "NTA - Your Dad and Stepmom definitely are tho", "NTA!!\n\n\nDo not apologize to your dad!! He honestly does not deserve it. Yes it's completely Paula's fault, but your dad allowed it. A grown ass man allowed his new young thing to ruin what should have been a special moment in his life, the pregnancy journey to his first grandkid. And yeah maybe some people aren't as keen to be involved as others, and that's ok, but he was, until Paula poisoned him. Personally I'd tell him to keep himself and the poison away from your kid. She's clearly jealous, which is just sad. But belittling you throughout your pregnancy doesn't then entitle her to being there at the end. NTA . They both need to grow up before they can think about being involved in your little one's life. (As far as I'm concerned-just my opinion, do with it what you will.) \n\nCongrats on your little one. I hope you're enjoying this new chapter \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA, what your father and Paula don't seem to get is that those 'dumb little parties' were things meant to support you and your happiness. To blow them off showed they don't care about you as person. Your father need to accept he's missed out on so many first grandparent milestones because he decided to listen to his girlfriends negativity.", "Eh, your son, his grandson, is no big deal. His birth wasn't worth all that attention.\n\nWasn't that their attitude before that precious baby was born? They don't get to pretend to be invested now that he is born. They can wait to meet him. And you better establish boundaries with Paula regarding your child.", "NTA\n\nWhy does Paula feel this way about babies.  Did she struggle with infertility and pregnancy in others is painful for her?  I just wonder if there is a reason for her indifference.  \n\nYou do not have to include anyone in your baby's first days you do not want to include.  I wouldn't want that huge cloud of negativity around me either.  \n\nI guess your Father and his very young wife just has a good dose of FAFO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you\u2019re interested in being involved in your grandchild\u2018s life, that\u2019s awesome but you gotta act like it.\u201d", "My dad didn\u2019t meet my daughter until she was 4 , she\u2019s seen her a handful of times or less. Do what you need to.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm not particularly fond of kids myself. I genuinely don't want any, I don't really enjoy being around them, especially babies and toddlers. But I would never ever act like Paula. Some of my friends have kids and I always congratulate them on pregnancies, send presents, go to any parties they have and so on.   \n\n\nPaula's behavior has been offensively rude to a point where I - like others in here - wonder if there's a deeper reason to it? Maybe secretly, she would love to have a child of her own, but your father doesn't want more children (very understandable, especially at his age)? Anyways, Paula's attitude is sickening and the only asshole here are her and your father, since he not only her spoil the joy of having a grandchild but also damaged his relationship to you.", "NTA. I feel like Paula is jealous that the attention is on someone else. I wonder if the grandfather was excited and talking about this at home, and she got sick of it. \n\nI don't have kids myself, but I still would have sent an announcement, I think. But that is your call, and with their comment about missing \"dumb parties,\" I can't say I blame you.", "I'm going to say NTA, but I feel your father is likely hurt since he found out via social media about his grandson. That's a double-edged sword there. Is there away to involve him without the girlfriend tagging along?", "Father can be involved with baby\u2019s but not Paula. Make it very clear.\n\n\u201cFather, she\u2019s too much for me to handle right now as a new mother. Her dismissive attitude has rubbed off on you, but I\u2019m willing to give you a chance to grandfather this child. However, I do not need this child to have another grandmother, so Paula is out.\u201d\n\nAnd stick to it.", "Nta but you should talk to your dad. You can offer an apology with a but. Like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you but it seemed like you lost interest in the baby, so I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u201d", "NTA we all expect certain standards.  If he wants to know the prize then he has to join the journey.  Your dad needs to own his actions & subsequently your actions.  He is not cut-off.  He is being treated the way he showed you he wanted to be treated, if he wants you to play seconds & not give attention to his daughter & grand baby to come then he gets second hand information as well.  You enjoy being a mum.  You enjoy being loved unconditionally.  You dad can use whatever time he needs to be a good humble grandfather & dad.  If you feel you want to invite him then do so but you owe his wife nothing.  If he says it's both or nothing.  You say that is a choice he is making not you as he is your father.  If he doesn't like the repercussions or possible conflict with his wife if he was to see you & baby that's a really poor excuse.  He has & will be your dad for life he might want to remind himself of the first 20 years of your life.  Sending loads of well wishes for this magical moment may you & your baby continue to be blessed always", "NTA tell him to keep up his attitude and he will miss hearing about more events. He FAFO\u2019d. He owes you an apology and until it\u2019s forthcoming, I would go LC", "NTA\n\nYour dad told you in so many words that celebrating the steps toward a major life event with you, his child, wasn\u2019t \u2018worth it.\u2019 That was a position he chose to adopt. It\u2019s okay for you to decide that pouring energy into your relationship with him and being rebuffed is not \u2018worth it.\u2019 And do you trust him to be a loving and engaged grandparent as the kid grows into awareness?", "[deleted]", "Nta, say \u201cI knew Paula would say it wasn\u2019t worth the trip\u201d", "NTA. You don't need Paula's negativity in your life, either directly or by proxy through your father. Sad that he left his own opinions and personality in his wife's purse, but that's a choice he made and only he can unmake.   \nWhat he faces now is the natural consequence of being a dismissive AH your entire pregnancy: you came to the logical conclusion he did not care and would not appreciate any special updates. How were you supposed to infer any sort of care about your son or your pregnancy, with how he behaved?  \nYou've got a son now, and better things in life to do than cater to your father's mind-game BS.", "NTA for sure. But I think I\u2019d try having a conversation with my dad privately on why he went from excited & happy to completely disinterested like whip lash. And if he intends to be more present in his grandchild\u2019s life or if Paula\u2019s going to dictate that too. \n\nCongratulations!!", "NTA f*ck around and find out! That is petty to the next level.  And yes you ARE using your baby as a pawn, but HE is YOUR pawn!   And i say that in the kindest and most encouraging way. I would have done the same thing, not only did they show disinterest in your pregnancy, they were negative.  And are still negative. \n\nCongrats on your new baby boy!", "NTA.  If OP Dad is is so daft that he can\u2019t express different feelings than his wife about his grandchild, he is \ud83d\udcafguilty of being an AH.", "YTA\nYou sound like one of those people who act like they're the first person to ever have a baby. A name reveal? Regular updates? Sheesh. While Paula was acting like an AH, it's unreasonable to expect everyone to be as i to your pregnancy as you and your husband. Given that giving birth is one of the most dangerous times in a woman's life, you could have at least notified your dad when you had the baby. You would have felt horrible if something happened to you or the baby and he wasn't there for you because you were being petty.", "NTA. Tell your dad that you don\u2019t want your relationship with him to be dependent on Paula. If he wants to let a stranger dictate how he treats you, then you will treat him as a stranger.", "Your father is either spineless or he agrees with his miserable Gf. NTA and keep LC with them if you feel that is best", "NTA - Paula sounds like a jealous shrew and not that it's your responsibility, but did you ever approach your dad and explain how his and Paula's comments are making you feel?  \n\nIt sounds like all your updates to him were social media posts...honestly, from my daughter I don't want to hear updates that way, I'd like a phone call or something a bit more personal, but that's just me.\n\nI do think you ended up creating some drama for yourself when you didn't have to.  Just tell your dad.  THEN you don't have to do anything else, he can reach out if/when he wants.  But not having him on your call list when you give birth to his first grandkid? That was a clear message...so now you have to deal with it one way or another. \n\nTry to keep drama down, and enjoy your newborn! Congratulations!", "Exactly this!! Does he not have his own brain? He couldn't go to his grandchild's naming party because PAULA didn't think it was worth it? She's perfectly allowed to think that, and not attend. However, if the grandfather of the child WANTED to be there, he could and should have said to his wifey, \"have a great afternoon! I will see you after the naming party.\"", "No, but from what I gather, she doesn't want to.", "And then to think she grew a pair as well\ud83d\ude04", ">And no, it isn't about showing up to parties.\n\nI'm trying to make that clear to them. My father missed my graduation; not coming to my baby shower doesn't bother me that much. It's the condescending attitude and lack of interest they have both been displaying my entire pregnancy that made me decide not to tell them.", ">Guaranteed he only wanted to come to the hospital for photos and to post on social media and show off.\n\nMy father is against posting pictures of children on social media, but he's definitely the type of person to try to show off in real life. That being said, I do believe he genuinely wanted to meet my son at the hospital.", "Your post is dumb as hell.  You have ZERO idea of why the dad would want to come to the hospital or what would happen if OP and dad talked. You seem to be projecting your insecurities in this thread.  Of course, ESH is the proper vote.", "Right!!  OP was just respecting their wishes.  If you're gonna let someone know (repeatedly) that you don't really care about their pregnancy, then you gotta chill the f\\*\\*\\* out when they take you at your word and don't keep you updated.", "Well said.  Agree, dad reads like an idiot and a hypocrite.  And the whole argument about \"using the baby as a pawn\" is such bs. \n\n\"Based on your behavior, we didn't leave ourselves open to any argument we were \"using\" the baby to get attention.\"\n\nOp is NTA.", "I'm almost certain Paula doesn't want children, and 100% sure that my dad doesn't want more kids.", "Agree with NTA and DO NOT APOLOGIZE\n\nThe only apology you might have to make is to your child if you have to tell them they have a deadbeat grandpa and step grandma. Your dad and Paula have no reason to be angry at you. They found out about your baby just not right when it happened. Thet were demoted from first string to the bench. It happens in any sport when you don't perform. If they put in the effort they might earn their way back to the first string. I'd keep Paula as the watergirl though, she's a little kooky.\n\nYour dad is the biggest AH not Paula. You knew what you were getting with her. She's married to your dad and probably limits her interest and involvement to what makes her happy. Your dad on the other hand is your blood and especially with you giving birth to his first grandchild, he should've been supportive from the announcement that you were pregnant to the announcement that your baby was born. If he wasn't a coward he would've put Paula in her place and let her know that his daughter and grandchild are his priority during this pregnancy. He proved he's not reliable as a source of support be it emotional or physical so you are right to keep him at a distance until he proves otherwise. Of course he can see the baby but on your terms. Congratulations.", "Total speculation, obviously, but my guess is that she feels competitive with her \"stepdaughters\" (using that term lightly) since she is closer in age to them than she is to her husband.\n\nI think she was/is worried that grandchildren will equal her husband paying less attention to her.  That is why she convinced him to skip the baby shower and even got him repeating that the baby shower  \"wasn't worth it.\"  Anything to keep his narcissistic-leaning younger wife happy.", "Paula actually seems to like babies. She acts this way only about pregnancy and the events that surround it. She was all over my cousin when her daughter was born, and I wouldn't be surprised if she did the same thing now.", "\"Incubator\" is a good term for how this situation has made me feel. Like the almost 9 months that took me to grow a whole person didn't matter.", ">who is closer to your age than your father\u2019s \ud83e\udd2e\n\nBarf, indeed. Don't even get me started. Paula is actually on the older side - none of the women my father has been with since divorcing my mom have been older than 35 by the time they broke up. I'm actually surprised his relationship with Paula has lasted this long.", "I wouldn't go that far. At least not yet.", "Reddit massive over reaction. Dad missed the naming party so now he can never see his grandchild? No. Such a silly comment.", "I know right?  Who has the energy to play these mind games!", "Seems like OP did, per her comments, but the man told his daughter she wasn't worth a few of his hours. I have 0 sympathy for him", "I didn't mention this because of the word limit, but I did talk to him, and so did my sister. More than once. He said he'd try to be more involved, but never made any attempt to do so. He either didn't remember our conversations or genuinely didn't care.\n\nAlso, the baby shower and name reveal were literally the only baby-related things I invited him and Paula to. Everything else that they were rude about were updates about my son's health.", "He told his own daughter she wasn't worth a few hours of his time. That's shitty", "I know it sounds like I was OTT, but I honestly don't think I was. There was only one party (the name reveal was more of a lunch event), I only told them about the first time the baby kicked, and most of the updates were regarding my son's health.\n\nAlso,\n\n>time to use your big girl worlds and talk to your dad\n\nI did talk to him. It didn't work.", "Condescending as all fuck to tell OP to use \"big girl worlds [sic]\"", "OPs cousin had a baby, not her sister.", "Sister doesn't have a child, cousin does.", "My sister doesn't have any children. My cousin does. This is my father's first grandchild.", "I'm very well aware that pregnancy is a normal thing. You're missing the point of what I'm upset about.", "And of course there's nothing wrong with that, but this really comes across to me as her having unresolved feelings about her decision to not have kids. Perhaps her feelings are exacerbated by people around her having kids, her getting older, being with a much older man, etc. She sounds like she's trying to convince herself and everyone else that because she didn't have kids, she has to poopoo on anyone that wants to celebrate those milestones that she didn't ever have. \n\nYou're NTA.", "She probably CAN'T! Just using don't want to as an excuse! NTA! And congratulations", "She was also a Time Lord since she technically had 2 hearts....", "He has missed important moments\u2026 he is no upset he wasn\u2019t there\u2026 he is upset that in front of other people he looked like a fool\u2026", "[removed]", "So you need to ask the question of why he was so absent during your pregnancy but wanted to meet your son at the hospital.", "Then he would have called you when you were 9 months pregnant. It doesn\u2019t matter that you are now a mother, it is his job as your parent to foster the relationship- he didn\u2019t foster it so now he has the consequences of his actions. Let him know if he wants to be a upstanding grandpa he has the chance to do so, but your child will not be treated as an afterthought to what Paula wants", "Girl, meeting a newborn if you are not one of the parents is a privilege\u2026 he didn\u2019t make enough effort to get that. He can pout whatever he wants.", "Well then he should have kept in better touch with you. He knew you were pregnant, I assume he knew an approximate due date. People do what they want to do. If he wanted to meet your baby in the hospital, he would have been calling at least every other day to see how you were both doing and if anything had happened yet. He dropped this ball, not you.", "NO, IT IS NOT! You are so triggered by my post for a reason. OP stated that she and the sister have talked to the Father and they were brushed off. I am not projecting any insecurities, but speaking FACTS. If you aren't going to be a GOOD PARENT and be easily swayed by a step parent because of HER INSECURITIES, then you do not get to be upset on how involved I allow you to be with my child. Grow up and stop being emotional to replies to individuals post.", "Probably she doesn\u2019t have kids because he doesn\u2019t want to, so she is bitter", "Also a good speculation.  I would love to know which it may be.", "I'd be pretty pissed if my dad missed an event because his wife didn't think it was \"worth it\" to support me, yeah.", "Everyone has their own opinions but if it were me yes I'd cut contact with people like that", "The Dad said his own daughter wasn't worth a few hours.

Where was the effort on their part? Where were they for the milestones? IMO you reap what you sow.", "I have to admit I don't really care what you think.  I was talking to OP.", "im so innatentive", "Totally agress, that or she's not missing the having kids part, but is mad she missed out on the attention she would have received as the pregnant person. Op is definitely NTA.", "Yeah also infertility and other reproductive issues is still a taboo subject so it's not uncommon for people to say or act like they don't want kids when really they've had no choice or had to make choices that were difficult. Doesn't excuse the behavior, but I think there's room to recognize that you just never know why somebody might act \"weird\" about kids or pregnancy.
