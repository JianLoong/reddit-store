I never got to know her well, as I was about to move out when we met. My sister (20F) still lives between our parents and likes Paula, but finds her annoying.\n\nPaula has an odd attitude towards pregnancy. It became the most obvious when my cousin announced she was expecting back in 2021. Her daughter would be the first great-grandchild. We hadn't been sure my grandma would be around for that. And after an emotional announcement in which everyone was overjoyed, Paula commented that she felt it wasn't a big deal, and \"didn't get what all the fuss was about\".\n\nShe kept that stance for all 9 months. But once the baby was born, Paula suddenly became a bit too interested in her, which my cousin was clearly uncomfortable with.\n\nMy husband (28M) and I announced our pregnancy earlier this year. At first, my father was over the moon. Since this is his first grandchild, I believed that would last.\n\nBut as I heard from my sister, Paula was just as condescending as we expected, if not more. Whenever I announced anything about my pregnancy or baby (sex, first kicks, ultrasound pictures, etc.), Paula always reacted with one of 3 phrases: \"okay\"; \"that's not that big a deal\"; or \"is that all she talks about these days?\".\n\nI didn't care about it at first. But after a few weeks, I started to notice my father was also losing any interest he had in my pregnancy. As the months went by, he became increasingly detached and standoffish. He started to either ignore or not pay attention to most of the updates I made on my baby. He also didn't come to our \"name reveal\" (we did that instead of a gender reveal; it was literally just a lunch party with a game we made up) or the baby shower because, and I quote, \"Paula doesn't think it's worth it\".\n\nMy son was born on Halloween, and I decided not to tell my father and Paula. After almost nine months of excuses and disinterest, I didn't see any reason to. I was in the hospital for 4 days, during which only mine and my husband's closest friends and family visited us.\n\nThe day before we left, I posted a picture of my son on Instagram, and that's when my father found out. He called to ask why I hadn't told him and Paula or invited them to meet my baby. I didn't lie: they didn't make any efforts to get involved (both emotionally and physically) during my pregnancy, so they'd have to wait for baby news like everybody else.\n\nMy father and Paula are furious, accusing me of using my son as a pawn and keeping them away out of pettiness.They're saying I'm holding the fact that they \"missed a few dumb parties\" against them.\n\nMy husband and pretty much my whole family agrees with me. My sister, while mostly on my side, still thinks I should have told my father, since this is his first grandchild and he had to find out he was born through social media. She thinks this is all Paula's fault and I should apologize to our dad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699374737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17py7re/aita_for_not_telling_my_father_and_stepmother/", "score": 3956, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to be willing to do his part as well and express interest and participate.\n\nAnd no, it isn't about showing up to parties.  It is about making the effort to be included when you are invited to be and not dismiss those invitations as if they are meaningless.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants a grandchild he needs to start acting like a father first. And he's not. He wasn't interested then, so why should he be now.", "What gets me is that she has gotten interested afterward, suggesting something. Maybe it is time to have a sit down talk with your father because obviously something is going on. Mayne she can not get pregnant herself and is jealous. NTA but this probably goes deeper then you know.", "NTA. All of the ESH replies are dumb as hell. Paula has your dad twirled around her finger. The only two in-person baby events that you had, they didn't show up, and your dad was standoffish for the majority of your pregnancy due to Paula. He is a grown-ass man. He doesn't get to all of a sudden meet and be involved in his first grandchild's life when he barely cared before. Guaranteed he only wanted to come to the hospital for photos and to post on social media and show off. Apologizing to your dad will not do anything, but only enable his BS. He needs to step up, put his foot down to Paula, and show you that he genuinely and actively wants to be a part of your immediate family's life. Your dad can be updated via social media until he gets his face out of his behind and acts like an actual father.", "NTA. They didn't miss \"dumb\" parties, to us parents those family gatherings are very important. He made his choice when he followed along with Paula's negative ass.", "NTA Your dad didn\u2019t only miss your pregnancy milestones, he failed to be a supportive father to you during your first pregnancy. He treated your pregnancy as unimportant, whether because he was influenced by Paula or not doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s a grown ass man and if he lets her control how he feels about his grandchild and how he supports his child then he doesn\u2019t need to be around the baby or know anything. I have a feeling Paula is jealous of anyone else getting attention and I wouldn\u2019t trust her around your son from what you said about how she acted with cousins baby.", "OPs Dad and Paula thought it was no big deal, so that's how OP played it.  I hope OPs Dad realises what an idiot he was being and starts thinking for himself rather than parroting Paula.

Let your Dad and Paula be mad; let them play dumb and act like they didn\u2019t do anything rude or dismissive during your pregnancy.  You don\u2019t have to be unfailing kind for forever, and you definitely don\u2019t need to feel bad now that they are upset that their actions reaped consequences.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not like you have tried to exclude Paula from your life.  Her issues are clearly *all about her*, not about poor treatments from her husband\u2019s daughters.  I\u2019m sure Paula has all kind of insecurities due to marrying a man 20 years older than her, but that\u2019s not your fault, and if your father is willing to let her drag him down into the muck with her, well that is his choice and these are the consequences.", "NTA\n\nHe made it clear how uninteresting he found the baby.", "NTA!

Don't let her poison your relationship without your dad.", "NTA. Paula is 38, and your dad is 59. That is a huge age gap. At the time when she got married, she may have decided she didn't want kids. And being in love with your dad, with that huge age gap, was her way of justifying her decision. But now, with all the recent pregnancies, she could be regretting her decision. And is even starting to resent her choice, you, your cousin, and even your dad because of his age. There may be deeper issues at play here. She may have brought this up to your dad that she changed her mind. But he could have said no. Instead of arguing, she took the passive-aggressive attitude towards those with babies. You may want to reconsider cutting them out of your life. Congrats on your new baby!", "NTA, and DO NOT apologize.\n\nYour dad is the asshole.  Paula is too, but it is your dad who let himself be affected by her.\n\n\"Dad, maybe I should have told you, but I didn't because every time I talked to you while I was pregnant, I felt rejected and made to feel small.  I know Paula has some kind of mental illness around pregnancy and birth, but you let her change your experience of this baby, and it was sucking all the joy out this huge, happy event in my life for me.  You don't seem to understand that you became weird and sad.  Do you really blame me for wanting to be with people who are happy for me and with me?\n\n\"I'm not sure how we can go forward from here.  Being a mother is now who I am.  Paula can't make that go away, and I don't want anyone around who acts like my baby isn't important.  It will just hurt me and hurt my son.  I guess the ball is in your court.  You need to figure out if you want to be an involved grandpa or just another of the extended family I don't stay in close contact with.", "NTA. It was your fathers choice not to show up and you step moms choice to be such a drag/nuisance throughout your pregnancy.  You were pregnant, the last thing that should\u2019ve been on your mind was other peoples BS reasons and actions for behaving like petulant children. Looking at your other comments I can see that you AND you sister even tried to breakthrough to your Dad but he was unwilling to listen/change. \n\nYes, you could have sent them an update\u2026which based on prior experience would have been received with an \u2018ok\u2019 \u2018why does this matter\u2019 or \u2018gosh, now the baby really is all she\u2019ll talk about\u2019. And after hearing that for months, with no attempt to shut down Paula, it\u2019s not surprising you didn\u2019t contact them. I wouldn\u2019t want that energy around me in postpartum nor my newborn child. \n\nPaula and your Dad needed a reality check and hopefully this works out. If not, it\u2019ll be on your Dad and Paula to fix it.", "NTA \n\nI also don't think you owe your father an apology. His behavior was terrible. He is unreasonable to be upset with you after being dismissive for 8 months.", "NTA. \n\nThey showed indifference about the pregnancy.  You matched their energy about the birth.", "NTA, as the saying goes, you reap what you sow. They didn\u2019t care for the baby during your pregnancy so you decided to not involve them in its birth/life. Seems fair to me. I wouldn\u2019t even feel guilty about it. Even if it\u2019s pure pettiness, I endorse it.", "NTA. \n\nWhen's the last time your father initiated a conversation to ask you how you were and how your pregnancy was? He undoubtedly was told of the due date at some point, did he not check in just before?  That's the bare minimum for someone with even a passing interest in your life. Yet they're still calling your parties \"dumb\"? They chose their level of engagement, you are merely respecting their choice.\n\nIf they bother to contact you again and want to talk about the baby, simply reply with \"Okay, that's not that big a deal. Is that all you talk about these days?\"", "NTA, he wasn't interested through your whole pregnancy so why bother telling him. I know your sister says that it's all Paula's fault but he's a grown man and can make his own decisions.", "NTA - Your Dad and Stepmom definitely are tho", "NTA!!\n\n\nDo not apologize to your dad!! He honestly does not deserve it. Yes it's completely Paula's fault, but your dad allowed it. A grown ass man allowed his new young thing to ruin what should have been a special moment in his life, the pregnancy journey to his first grandkid. And yeah maybe some people aren't as keen to be involved as others, and that's ok, but he was, until Paula poisoned him. Personally I'd tell him to keep himself and the poison away from your kid. She's clearly jealous, which is just sad. But belittling you throughout your pregnancy doesn't then entitle her to being there at the end. NTA . They both need to grow up before they can think about being involved in your little one's life. (As far as I'm concerned-just my opinion, do with it what you will.) \n\nCongrats on your little one. I hope you're enjoying this new chapter \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA, what your father and Paula don't seem to get is that those 'dumb little parties' were things meant to support you and your happiness. To blow them off showed they don't care about you as person. Your father need to accept he's missed out on so many first grandparent milestones because he decided to listen to his girlfriends negativity.", "Eh, your son, his grandson, is no big deal. His birth wasn't worth all that attention.\n\nWasn't that their attitude before that precious baby was born? They don't get to pretend to be invested now that he is born. They can wait to meet him. And you better establish boundaries with Paula regarding your child.", "NTA\n\nWhy does Paula feel this way about babies.  Did she struggle with infertility and pregnancy in others is painful for her?  I just wonder if there is a reason for her indifference.  \n\nYou do not have to include anyone in your baby's first days you do not want to include.  I wouldn't want that huge cloud of negativity around me either.  \n\nI guess your Father and his very young wife just has a good dose of FAFO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's definitely no way for a grandfather to find out.\n\nOP says she genuinely thought her father wouldn't care, but it seems to me she purposefully wanted to punish him for choosing her step-mothers feelings over her own.", "Lmfao I\u2019m sorry but you need to level with your sister. I get it, she\u2019s 20, but it\u2019s time. Your dad very clearly does not let the women in his life call the shots if he has dated enough women since your mother for you to say something like this. He obviously doesn\u2019t have a problem dropping a lady.\n\nHonestly, Paula owes you guys nothing. Do I think that her behavior makes her an asshole? Yes. She was just being nasty. So yeah, she\u2019s an asshole, but this is still on your dad because he is **your dad.** Paula is just some woman who will probably not be a permanent fixture in your lives. Your dad, as a grown ass man, made his decisions all on his own. Paula is nothing in this situation besides a nuisance and an instigator. Your father did not have to let any of this happen.\n\nWhich I know you know, but sometimes we just have to tell our siblings like it is, and your little sister needs to realize that Paula is actually a non-factor in this. She did not need to be relevant at all, but your dad let her be.", "In my opinion, it would have been more than adequate for her to text her Dad after she got home but before posting on media. What\u2019s done is done. I don\u2019t agree with her dad following Paula\u2019s lead I suspect he does to not make waves.  Common in so many families.", "Agreed. Talk with your father directly. Make it clear to him that it's fine if Paula didn't want to be involved. But him choosing to ignore and degrade his kids happiness in favor of his wife's disinterest is his choice. And his choice showed you he didn't care. So if that's not the case and he does care, he needs to start making up for that and learn to consider both his own feelings about a situation AND the feelings of more than just his wife. \n\nThe choice is all in his court.", "\"Paula always reacted with one of 3 phrases: \"okay\"; \"that's not that big a deal\"; or \"is that all she talks about these days?\"\n\nI'm very much in the camp of not interested in yours or anyone's child and pregnancy but Paula's putting in more effort to her replies to be rude and cause problems than she would need to put in to keep the peace. My stock replies (\"amazing\", \"thanks for updating\", \"fantastic news\", \"good to hear\", \"sounds great\") for anything I don't care about take less effort than what she's replying\n\nRegardless the dad's the real AH because he was excited and allowed himself to be talked out of it/changed his own behaviour to complement his partner's and is then upset he wasn't kept in the loop, Paula was never interested and doesn't have a familial relationship with OP either. Though the fact she's apparently furious now does give her AH vibes only for the hypocrisy", "She's also worse, because she has apparently been sooo overtly negative about the whole pregnancy that her husband, about to become a grandfather, also lessened his excitement. She's manipulative or at least coercive or some other negative term I can't think of at the moment. \n\nIt's worse than just bad manners because she exerted her opinion on someone else and prevented them from having enjoyment in the process.", "Dad is responsible for his own choices. He had ample opportunities to be involved on his own, either through attending the events himself or reaching out via text or phone calls. He made the decision to not be involved with his grandchild's pregnancy. Him allowing his wife's feelings to the point of practically ignoring his daughter and first grandchild is him lacking a spine. He is not entitled to getting news first that he's clearly shown he wasn't interested in.", "The minute she started affecting your dad's behaviour she became an AH, whatever her excuses or motivations. She cost him that experience and he cost himself it by not being a grown adult. Congratulations!", "And that's just as bad if not worse. He won't come spend time with his kid because there will be discussion of a baby?? His grandkids name?? Geez.", "She could be one those women who has no interest in the process of the 'bun cooking in the oven' but once the bun is out, whole other story.\n\nNTA.  OP's father is a grown ass adult, if he wanted to know why didn't HE reach out to find out?  He has two children, if they're bio kids, then 'presumably' he knows how long the cooking takes. \ud83d\ude44", "yeah, the dad made choices about his daughter. something tells me OP doesn't care too much about Paula's interest or lack of. Dad was supposed to be there for her- and he failed. He gave up the title of grandpa.", "Lol no they're not. I'm not even with someone who could get me pregnant if I wasn't infertile, but I still get asked things like \"well is it an issue with your eggs, could you get them frozen to use a surrogate? Make sure to do that before you're too old!\" or \"well have you tried _\" or \"you're still gonna adopt, right?\". It's just that the inappropriate questions become different.\n\nAnd even if you're someone who is infertile and didn't want kids, the feelings around it can still be complicated, because it's no longer a choice you made but rather your body making choices for you. I'm not someone who really wanted kids. But then I found out I was most likely infertile due to a particular medical issue, and that wasn't my choice anymore, it was just further proof that my body wasn't my own and that it attacks itself for shits and giggles and that no matter what I do, I don't have the same amount of autonomy in being able to make these types of decisions. Therapy has helped me work through it a lot. If that's similar to what's going on in this situation, OP's stepmother desperately needs therapy.", "It's not socially normal to be uninterested in your essentially step daughter's pregnancy and being so toxic about it you spread that venom onto your partner making them miss out on their first grandchild either", "We pretty much made a custom Clue board game! \n\nRather than guessing the suspect, weapon and murder location, the goal was to guess the name (there were 6 options), the first stuffed animal we'd gotten him (also 6 options) and a random room in our apartment (9 options, and we mostly kept that part just to make things harder for the players).\n\nWe used a template of the Clue board as a base and added mini versions of the rooms in our apartment. We got miniature animals to stand in for the weapons. And we also made the cards from scratch.\n\nI work with animation and my husband briefly studied graphic design. We had some help from my architect friend and two other friends who got design degrees.\n\nIt was a little over the top, but we had a lot of fun doing it. It was basically a collective passion project.", "NTA \n\nThe father knew when she was due. He could have reached out indeed", "That's cool!!!", "That. Sounds. Awesome!!\n\nCongrats on the new baby, by the way. Best wishes to your new family of three. Enjoy this time together; it passes so quickly. \n\nNTA."]}
