One of the housemates regularly has his GF (21F) over. Outside of the issue at hand she\u2019s fun, is a creative cook, and seems to be very caring. From what I\u2019ve gathered she has a difficult home situation which is why she bunks at our place 3-4 nights out of the week.\n\nThis housemate works remotely and I work day shift. Everyone else works night shift so it\u2019s usually just me, the housemate, and his GF home at night, so I don't think the others know that this has been happening. His GF has anxiety. This results in what I think are panic attacks(?) that last for HOURS and they always happen after midnight. Crying, sometimes screaming, sometimes stomping around the house, pounding on walls. The first several nights it happened I asked if there was any way I could help but there isn't.\n\nI\u2019ve tried headphones, melatonin\u2026 anything to help myself sleep through the screaming/crying/raging. It happens 2-4 nights a week and has been going on for two months now. I\u2019m honestly beginning to struggle at work because I\u2019m so unbelievably tired some days. I fell asleep in my car (parked at the house after work) last week unintentionally. My stomach is a mess because I\u2019m pounding coffee and energy shots. One night last week I slept in the concrete basement because it was quieter.\n\nLast night she went from 12 AM to 4 AM. At that point I had already been awake for going on 48 hours (not entirely due to her, had to take my mother to the hospital unexpectedly the night before). I couldn\u2019t think straight and was starting to feel physically ill from exhaustion. I texted my housemate and said, \u201cTake her to the hospital for help or tell her to STFU because I can't sleep and I have to be at work in 3 hours.\u201d I am not proud of my wording and I did apologize.\n\nHis response was, \u201cshe\u2019ll be done soon quit being an insensitive prick.\u201d He also told the other housemates in our group chat that I was \"being oppressive\" to his GF \"while she's struggling.\" The others are not sure who the AH is in this situation (me for how I worded my text or him for calling me an AH for it) or how to address it. She needs help and I need sleep so I understand the dilemma but... AITA?\n\nUpdate: Whoa, thank you all for your thoughts. Even the YTA votes are giving me a lot to think on. Unfortunately I have now come down with the stomach bug my parents had so I slept off and on through the afternoon/evening. \n\nI texted the housemate individually and said I really need the GF to not be here tonight being sick AF as I am. They both showed up maybe 2 hours after I messaged him. I will say she was very kind and made me some soup from scratch and left some ginger ale at my door. She said she\u2019d be leaving soon so I assume he told her about my message. It\u2019s going on 11:30 here and I can still hear them downstairs so I\u2019m not hopeful. Going to get through this god awful sickness before I decide for sure how to address it. I just hope this is one of her quiet nights if she does stay over.

Don't get me wrong panic attacks can suck but from what you've said in this post, they dont generally happen that frequently and that severe and if they do the person needs to seek help and treatment.

Either way it\u2019s not her fault if she\u2019s not in control of herself, but it is her responsibility not to put herself in a position where she\u2019s regularly disturbing others if she knows this happens.", "NTA.

She's clearly in a pretty bad state, and while it's not great that others are affected by her behavior, she's not doing it intentionally, and considering how bad the symptoms seem to be, she's probably not able to properly control her behavior fully (a very common symptom for mental illness).

I'm sorry that she has problems, but raging around someone's home for 4 hours in the middle of the night is not acceptable, especially when it seems to be a regular occurrence.\n\nThis woman needs help.  NOW.  Her boyfriend should be encouraging her to see a therapist, go to a hospital, talk to her doctor - anything but just letting her disturb the other people in your home.\n\nCan you record her the next time she has one of these attacks?

It sounds like this young lady needs serious intervention for her mental health issues, and your roommate is not doing her any favors by just allowing her outbursts. Hold a house meeting with the roommates (do not include the girlfriend) and tell them all that if this is allowed to continue you will have no choice but to move for your health. Approach the mental illness factor with empathy, and maybe find some local resources for her that might be helpful. I think a recording of the issue would be helpful for the other roommates to see extreme behavior, especially as it seems so polar opposite of her behavior during the day. I doubt your roommates that work nights would be so forgiving if this was happening during the day, when they are trying to sleep. If they push back, mention this. It\u2019s a tough situation, but from the sound of it the best solution is for the boyfriend and girlfriend to find their own place.

I would actually broach this topic with your landlord. She does not live there, and her behavior should not be interfering with the people actually on the lease. Since she clearly isn\u2019t or won\u2019t get help for these issues, you need to have a sit down discussion with your roommate. Tell him if it continues, you will be contacting the landlord.

That\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility. OP pays rent there, she does not.

I don't know where you live, but $1320 for rent is really cheap for where I am, most people are actually paying way more.", "What's an ambien walrus though ?", "1320 is absurdly high for where I live, I just took national averages and not one particular location.

That's all. I also never mentioned gen x."]}
