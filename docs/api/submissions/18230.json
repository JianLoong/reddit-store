Don't get me wrong panic attacks can suck but from what you've said in this post, they dont generally happen that frequently and that severe and if they do the person needs to seek help and treatment.

I'm sorry that she has problems, but raging around someone's home for 4 hours in the middle of the night is not acceptable, especially when it seems to be a regular occurrence.\n\nThis woman needs help.  NOW.  Her boyfriend should be encouraging her to see a therapist, go to a hospital, talk to her doctor - anything but just letting her disturb the other people in your home.\n\nCan you record her the next time she has one of these attacks?

It sounds like this young lady needs serious intervention for her mental health issues, and your roommate is not doing her any favors by just allowing her outbursts. Hold a house meeting with the roommates (do not include the girlfriend) and tell them all that if this is allowed to continue you will have no choice but to move for your health. Approach the mental illness factor with empathy, and maybe find some local resources for her that might be helpful. I think a recording of the issue would be helpful for the other roommates to see extreme behavior, especially as it seems so polar opposite of her behavior during the day. I doubt your roommates that work nights would be so forgiving if this was happening during the day, when they are trying to sleep. If they push back, mention this. It\u2019s a tough situation, but from the sound of it the best solution is for the boyfriend and girlfriend to find their own place.

Since she clearly isn\u2019t or won\u2019t get help for these issues, you need to have a sit down discussion with your roommate. Tell him if it continues, you will be contacting the landlord.

She needs someone she trusts to tell her it\u2019s time to get mental help", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s using it as manipulation but I\u2019d bet that whatever scarred her probably happened when an adult came home from a second shift job. She needs help. More than OP or his roomie can give her. If she can\u2019t live at home she needs to get to some sort of emergency housing. This is social worker/crisis territory. Empathy is the right path here but not to your own detriment, OP. I also wouldn\u2019t video tape her without her permission and send it to anyone you never know who will pass it along and where it will end up. If she\u2019s having some sort of episode or ptsd the last thing she needs is to see a video of herself on the internet for the lulz down the line.", "Seems like a big jump to make on no evidence. If she's having something like PTSD, a certain time of day/night could trigger it if whatever traumatized her happened around that time.", "You've been sleep deprived for months, don't beat yourself up on the wording. Her mental health issues are having a negative impact on your health. You can't take any more.\n\nAs a mental health professional, these don't sound like panic attacks, but whether they are or not, they've tried this method for months and nothing is improving.\n\nYou can have empathy for someone but still put your own needs first. You NEED sleep, much more than she needs to stomp around your home screaming all night.\n\nEven if she were an official tenant, this behaviour wouldn't be acceptable. It certainly isn't as your roommates guest.\n\nRecording it to play back to your other roommates is a good idea. Try to get them to understand that, ok, your wording wasn't great but you haven't slept properly in months and it is leaving you ill and exhausted. \n\nYou pay to be able to sleep there at night and her behaviour is stopping you from sleeping. This needs to stop and she needs REAL medical help. \n\nThen, you can sit your roommate down for an intervention about his girlfriend needing proper help and house rules about guests staying over, and how those guests should behave. Hopefully your other roommates will back you on this. \n\nIf none of the above works you need to start calling wellness checks or, if available in your area, the mental Health crisis team. \n\nBeing kind about it isn't helping her and it's making you ill. I always say that anyone who says that mental illness isn't contagious hasn't lived with someone with untreated mental illness. \n\nThis needs to stop, for everyone's sake. And you need to put your health first. \n\nPlease let us know how you get on? I'll be sending magical interweb support your way.", "Is the landlord one of the people currently living in the home?", "This person who is not a roomate has affected your sleep and mental health.  She and your roommate sound selfish as hell.  No need to apologize.", "Your wording was NOT harsh she needs to get tf out your house. She's not a tenant & her mental health issues are her own to navigate", "I don't think it was harsh, I just don't think it was direct enough. She is screaming and pounding on walls for hours during the middle of the night. If she is going through something that causes her to do this, she needs professional help, there is ZERO empathy being expressed when a person in a crisis is left alone to suffer and make others around them suffer so your housemate has his head up his ass about that.\n\nFrankly it doesn't matter what's going on between them, what matters is that she's not on the lease and is creating a disturbance for those who are. She needs to go. The landlord should be notified.", "She certainly does need help and of course it is not right, but my point is that the other 3, the legal tennants, don't seem to be bothered by it and because it is a house, the neighbours don't hear her. The landlord is the only one who can kick her out, and then only if causes damage. Did OP sign the lease? He didn't mention that so I expect not. Unless OP can get the other 2 guys on his side, he has a problem. They don't work 7 days a week, so surely they should have heard her on weekends?\n\nRecording her could help, but again, it the others are never home when she does this, they don't care.", "Agreed, they \"should\". But is the roommate the one who signed the lease?", "Can't be repeated often enough. Do Not Call The Police.", "This. Speak to your landlord.", "So, she CAN control it at work. Unless she's in a field where she can take a few hours off here and there for freak outs... Hopefully in a literal field.", "Is she taking anything at night to bring this on?   Some medications can have crazy side effects that the person doesn\u2019t remember much about. \n\nShe absolutely needs intervention \u2026 her BF is not helping her right now by enabling her to rage for hours each night.", "I wondered if the house mate is hurting her.", "Perfect answer.", "Do not call cops for a wellness check, this gets people killed.", "He is essentially being tortured every night that she is over. Sleep deprivation is a very popular torture method. OP is gonna hurt hurt himself or others if he gets into a car accident because he fell asleep at the wheel.", "Many places do not have mobile mental health crisis teams, the police are often the only option in rural areas. And honestly rural cops and state police are usually a bit more chill than city cops. On a wellness check they'll usually take you to the local hospital or they'll call an ambulance to take you. If the wellness check if for a possible suicide or serious mental health episode (like the gf is having) usually they dispatch an ambulance with the cops right away. (Source, live in rural area and have had wellness checks called on me, so have first hand experience with a police run wellness check)", "I agree that jail isn't where this girl needs to be. \n\nBut assuming that all cities/counties have a \"local emergency mental health provider\" or \"crisis services\" is naive. Often, the police are the only agency available for mental health crisis'.", "Yeah, after I posted, I thought it might make stuff worse if they think OP called the cops. They might assume he wants her arrested versus a checkup.", "yeah former psych nurse, they can and do bring people having an \"episode\" in to the hospital for an eval. If they can be calm and explain, it's a few hours. If not it's longer and sometimes with and IVC.", "I was about to post exactly this. Sleep deprivation is literally used as a torture method. OP needs to tell his roommates the extent of the situation.", "I understand not everyone even knows you often have the option to call specialised for crisis mental health professionals in situations like this. That's why I mentioned it, so that op may make the right call.", "Thanks for doing that. Now I know it's an option and will tell people too."]}
