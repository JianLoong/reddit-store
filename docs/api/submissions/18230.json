Don't get me wrong panic attacks can suck but from what you've said in this post, they dont generally happen that frequently and that severe and if they do the person needs to seek help and treatment.

I'm sorry that she has problems, but raging around someone's home for 4 hours in the middle of the night is not acceptable, especially when it seems to be a regular occurrence.\n\nThis woman needs help.  NOW.  Her boyfriend should be encouraging her to see a therapist, go to a hospital, talk to her doctor - anything but just letting her disturb the other people in your home.\n\nCan you record her the next time she has one of these attacks?

It sounds like this young lady needs serious intervention for her mental health issues, and your roommate is not doing her any favors by just allowing her outbursts. Hold a house meeting with the roommates (do not include the girlfriend) and tell them all that if this is allowed to continue you will have no choice but to move for your health. Approach the mental illness factor with empathy, and maybe find some local resources for her that might be helpful. I think a recording of the issue would be helpful for the other roommates to see extreme behavior, especially as it seems so polar opposite of her behavior during the day. I doubt your roommates that work nights would be so forgiving if this was happening during the day, when they are trying to sleep. If they push back, mention this. It\u2019s a tough situation, but from the sound of it the best solution is for the boyfriend and girlfriend to find their own place.

I would actually broach this topic with your landlord. She does not live there, and her behavior should not be interfering with the people actually on the lease. Since she clearly isn\u2019t or won\u2019t get help for these issues, you need to have a sit down discussion with your roommate. Tell him if it continues, you will be contacting the landlord.

That\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility. OP pays rent there, she does not.
