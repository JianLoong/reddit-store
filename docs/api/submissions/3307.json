It\u2019s not her place to say that you need to take care of her child all night. She didn\u2019t even ask. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to put an end to this idea with the SIL.", "\"Lol, that's amusing. But seriously SIL, have you started figuring out how you're going to manage both children in your room?\"\n\nNTA, and if she responds that she was serious, just reply in a surprised tone, \"Oh. Well, I definitely would not be comfortable with that. Good luck figuring it out though.\"\n\nNot only is your SIL being disrespectful of you (assuming that you'd be okay with it instead of having a serious conversation and asking you? Super rude), she's also highly unrealistic. Toddlers tend to struggle with new people and be environments. So unless you and your fianc\u00e9 regularly babysit the toddler overnight, it's highly unlikely that she would respond well to being in a room with someone other than mommy and daddy while in a new house", "NTA. It is rude to try and force a child onto another. Absolutely put your foot down. But first, perhaps look at alternatives just in case.\n\nEdit: and also discuss with the aunt/property owner.", "Nta, though it would be better to tell your fianc\u00e9 that you are not willing to do that. I\u2019m hosting that SIL was joking, but you can never tell for sure", "I say this as mom of a toddler, NTA. My baby is no one else\u2019s responsibility other than my own. BIL and SIL will just have to make the most of it. If the one bedroom is too small for the family of four, suggest that they get a two bedroom hotel room.", "NTA. \n\nTheir kid or sleeping arrangements are not your problem. You didn't volunteer to babysit the kid too. Have a talk with your fiance and tell them you don't feel comfortable with this arrangement.", "You should tell her the sex in your room will be louder than the baby so \u201cshe will have to keep her in her own room\u201d.  NTA.", "YWNBTA. But you\u2019re going to have to state your mind and stick to it. They can put a pack-n-play in any other room and get a baby monitor if they\u2019re that worried. If I were you I\u2019d absolutely refuse.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust make it a hard NO, and refuse to further discuss it.", "Uh no, the kids should stay with their parents.  Y\u2019all need to say no now.  It\u2019ll come better from your fianc\u00e9 if he\u2019s the one to say no.  Is alternate lodging possible?  This us not going to end well.  I\u2019d bail before I\u2019d take on the responsibility of someone else\u2019s kid.  I\u2019ve done the family vacation before with in-laws.  No way I hell ever again.  It was hell on earth, not a vacation.", "NTA - Not your kid, not your responsibility. Keep in mind, that might have repercussions.  You can set your boundaries, but others might set theirs as well.", "NTA. Not your kid not your problem. What\u2019s wrong with the couch for the kid to sleep on. That\u2019s where I was relegated to as kid in a guest house.", "NTA. They need to find some other accommodation for sleeping arrangements. They're the ones who had the kids, they need to figure out their sleeping arrangements and not put it on you.", "NTA.  Her kid, her problem.", "NTA have your fianc\u00e9 tell her very firmly that her child will not be sharing a bedroom with you two next vacation he needs to set a firm boundary with his family", "NTA. Talk to you\u2019re fianc\u00e9 about the fact that you\u2019re not comfortable being responsible for a toddler who is not your own. Suggest that you\u2019d be more comfortable sharing the room with other adults if there is an extra bed, but caring for such a young child is a huge responsibility.", "NTA - you need to put your foot down and say she\u2019s not my kid she doesn\u2019t have to sleep i\u2019m the same room as me and my fianc\u00e9. also bring it up to your fianc\u00e9. she\u2019s not your responsibility!", "NTA\n\nbut put your foot down hard now!! \n\nSo it\u2019s okay for their kid to keep you two up, but not their own parents/new sibling??\n\nNope nope nope", ">We stay with his older aunt and bedroom spaces are admittedly limited. \n\n\n\n\nNTA for saying no to your BIL, it\u2019s a rude thing to impose upon you and you shouldn\u2019t have to deal with sleeping with a toddler. I just hope the aunt is either on your side or stays out of it, because if she agrees you should share then there isn\u2019t much you\u2019d be able to do about it.", "No nta. Just make sure that if this is raised again, you BOTH categorically state that you won't be sleeping with the toddler in your room and they have the coming months to ensure that their household is able to join the holidays and understand if they decide they cannot manage to attend next year of cannot ensure their toddler is not disturbed by the baby.", "NTA, your fianc\u00e9 needs to be the one handling this.", "YWNBTA. I\u2019m a mum of two and have done the family-trip-with-two-kids, always involving all four of us staying in one bedroom. I never in a million years would send off my toddler to spend the night with others. Not only is that rude, but a toddler likely would lose it being away from their parents anyway. This \u201csolution\u201d is absolute ridiculous. I have fond memories of my well-rested, pre-children life, as well, and I would never subject a childfree family member to the trials of toddler/baby sleep unless it was an emergency, which this absolutely is not.", "It stinks.  I would not go", "Silence implies consent, so you definitely need to tell her now that you will not be sharing a room with her child. If you wait until next year it will be a much bigger deal than if you nip it now. \nNTA.", "NTA - but speak up and shut this nonsense down now. That way it won't be a surprise next year when you refuse to share your room with niece.", "Nta. Uh no. Not your kid, not your problem. Period. End of discussion.", "NTA. I'd argue that you are if you respond in any way other than 'this will not work for me'.", "NTA. If you end up going somewhere else, they will have plenty of room.", "I have a 2 year old and a 5 month old. When my boy was new, he cried A LOT through the night and my daughter woke up because of it in the first week but after that, she got used to it and slept through his crying. Children adjust easily and quickly. \n\nDon't let them push the toddler off on you. It's so rude and entitled. If they can't handle two kids, they shouldn't have made a second.", "NTA. Let her know that you plan to have sex while on vacation, and arent interested in an audience. (Whether or not this is true, it should get your point across that its an inappropriate ask)", "NTA - oh so not okay. At all. Her kids, her responsibilities.", "NTA just say, \u201cthat sounds like a you problem. Good luck with that.\u201d", "NTA if you are refusing to share a bed with your niece but soft YWBTA if you're objecting to having a sleeping space added for your niece.\n\nYou're vacationing with a family in a space that doesn't have enough bedrooms to accommodate everyone individually. This was bound to happen and privacy may be a bigger issue as the family grows.\n\nAs an alternative, you could arrange stay at a nearby hotel, Air BnB etc. This way you can pop over for all those fun festivities but still ensure you get the uninterrupted full night's rest.", "If you aren\u2019t paying for the room, you get what you get. Don\u2019t like it? Get your own hotel room where you can exert some control. \n\nThat being said, how did they arrive at you and your fianc\u00e9 as being the likely babysitters?", "I saw this exact post a couple of weeks ago.", "You're going to \"put your foot down\" to your fianc\u00e9's aunt who is your host? About a demand that she hasn't even made to you? This isn't your SIL's home or her decision, and who knows what may transpire between now and next year.\n\nYTA for even thinking of starting drama over this in advance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
