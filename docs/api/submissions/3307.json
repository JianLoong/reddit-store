It was my parents, my sister and her husband and infant, and then me (my husband was out of the country). \n\nThey all expected me to sleep on a pull out bed in the living room so the infant could have her own room. I was 35. \n\n(To be fair, I did volunteer to sleep on a pull out bed when my parents were looking at a two-bedroom, particularly since they were paying.  But that doesn't mean that if there is a three bedroom, I should get kicked out for an infant. I just knew they were having a hard time finding something big enough). \n\nI ended up actually crying to my father, but didn't mean to. It triggered me a lot. I have always been grateful for my parents giving me things or doing things for me and never expected nice things. My younger sister always wanted the best.\n\n\nBut it was the culmination of years of the squeaky wheel getting the best. When I turned 16, my parents gave me their 7-year old Subaru and I was over the moon that they gave me a car. My sister got a brand new, red, sleek looking car when she turned 16 a few years later. When my Subaru broke down my first year of college and I couldn't afford to buy a new one, they gave my sister a new Miata and gave me her car.  \n\nThey gave her other things like their old Wedgewood china without seeing if I was interested. I was always torn about it... Because while I am not super materialistic, and was genuinely just grateful for my parents extreme generosity... The disparity just hurt. I felt like I was being treated less equitably for being chill and grateful.  But guilt for feeling any kind of negative way because I really was grateful to receive any of that from them. Like - the stuff didn't matter. Not at all. I would have been fine on a pull out couch in a two-bedroom. I am so grateful for the privileged start they gave me. But the disparity made me feel like they somehow valued me a little less. Or cherished her more... But all those years, I kept it in, because it was all above and beyond what parents need to provide for their children.\n\nSo it all came out at age 35, and I was sobbing to my father at the kitchen table of our AirBnB about how I don't understand how I as an adult am getting shafted for an infant who my sister chose to have. But I also didn't want to cause drama, particularly when it was essentially a gift from them to be there at all! And I felt guilty for being upset because I didn't want to seem ungrateful. \n\nHe understood pretty quickly, and I ended up in a bedroom. It didn't get dramatic - he just said I should put my things up in the room (oh yeah, I was there two nights and my sis/BIL were only there one, on top of it all), and that he would just nonchalantly mention that was where I was staying. And it worked out fine. \n\nBut it does suck to feel like your needs/comfort are more expendable than others, especially when it's family.", "Her kids,  her problem.

At least my toddler sleeps through TV noice, loud cars outside... even fireworks cannot wake her.", "I was thinking more that since no one needs or seems to want adults to double up, it would be low risk to say that\u2019s less of a problem, especially since it would be way less inconvenient than a toddler.", "But even if they were parents or had kids of their own, it's still not their responsibility to have another kid tossed at them.", "> with a king bed.\n\nNo, you get a room with a tight double bed so you and fiance have zero space for a child to wiggle in.", "Reason 476 why I always get a hotel room even if the people I'm visiting have \"plenty of room.\" Why do people think this is so weird?", "It's a frighteningly common sight on r/shitmomgroupssay", "Uh no your SIL can deal with her own kids on a vacation. If she think just because she\u2019s having another kid she can just get rid of the other one because the baby will wake her up that\u2019s just messed up.

They need to take responsibility for their child. If they\u2019re worried the baby will keep the toddler awake, maybe they should see if they can get an adjoining room so the toddler can have her own room or, idk, deal with the consequences of their choice to take a baby on a week long vacation.
