I had asked Grace about if she had forgot to call me and she stated \"I fed the important children\". At this point I had forgotten my mom was still on the phone and stormed outside crying. Sometimes during this my mom called my dad screaming ask wth grace was thinking. My dad blamed baby brain and let her slide, after this she treated me horriblely.

Also\u2026 your dad is ridiculous. You\u2019re under 16? You ARE a child\u2026 HIS child!
