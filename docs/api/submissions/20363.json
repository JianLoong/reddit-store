He needs to learn to stand on his own 2 feet and that won\u2019t happen unless you force him too. I hope it works. Good luck.", "Sometimes we men need to get checked back into reality when we decide to be lazy. You did what you had to, and while a little jerky i bet its the kick your son needs to get on track with his life before it derails completely.  \n\nNTA", "OP so you have 2 other children that you have no problems with, working and apparently mature enough to take care of themselves, yet you're being raked over the coals for allowing your son to fend for himself because he apparently feels he knows more than yourself?  If that's the case then I honestly don't know how you're feeling that you're in the wrong here.  You're not willing to potentially raise 3 more children (our son, his gf, and a potential baby).  I'm not actually seeing what the problem is.  My mom was tough with me and let me know I needed to make my own way and it's what helped me succeed.  Hopefully he'll get past this and realize he needs to do some growing up.", "[removed]", "Nta. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s making these choices. Tough love is sometimes all you can do to help. He\u2019s an adult. Otherwise you\u2019re enabling him and destroying your own security and mental well being.", "NTA.  He is an adult, you tried to reason with them, they refuse to do anything to help themselves and put you in danger by giving out your house codes.  You had no choice as far as I can see.  Maybe this will be a wakeup call for him.", "NTA. I don't get all the people blaming you for his actions and saying you didn't raise him right. Every child has their own characteristics.   You can raise them all the same and one of them can be completely different than the others. I've seen it first hand. \n\nAs far as I can tell, you've done all you can do and he's not interested in being a productive member of society.", "INFO:  Did you provide your son an eviction notice and give him the legally required time to move out? If not, YTA. That was an illegal eviction. Nobody deserves to be instantly homeless even if they are a fuckup.", "Info: what\u2019s wrong with him wanting to work on the other side of town?\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely an AH for saying he\u2019s no longer your so.", "I\u2019m confused about why you have a comment about the girlfriend and if she uses birth control or not. First, there are many reasons a woman might not want to use hormonal birth control. Second, the woman isn\u2019t the only one responsible for preventing pregnancy. Third, that\u2019s a discussion for her, her doctor, and her SO. But definitely not her SOs parent. That alone makes YTA.", "NTA. Sometimes you have to get tough for a kid to hear you. When I was 20, I was going through a rootless period, out of school, jobless and directionless, and my dad sat me down and told me that I had until the end of the next month (a little under six weeks) to find a job, any kind of job. If I didn't have anything by then, he would buy me a bus pass, hand me $50, and wish me luck. He told me it would break his heart to do it, but he would if I continued on my current path.\n\nI could see just how serious he was, and believe me, I was terrified. I had a job in two weeks. To this day, I'm grateful that he did that, that I wasn't allowed to drift for longer than I did. Hopefully, one day your son will look back on this with similar thoughts.", "So it's not that he doesn't want a job, it's that you don't want him to have a job where he wants and therefore you're the one holding him back?\n\nIf he doesn't have a job then how is he supposed to move out?\n\nMaybe try family counseling first.\n\nESH", "Nta", "NTA, at 19 he needs to grow up and start to figure out what he wants to do with life.  For me the final straw would be giving the door code to random people that just walk in.  This is so dangerous for everyone in the house most of all his sister.  Who would walk in on her when she is alone.", "NTA - I would do the same thing.  He can live however he wants when he gets his new place", "YTA\n\nI mean, you do realize YOU raised him, YOU trained him to be what he is today, YOU failed to establish any boundaries, YOU want him to get a job where YOU want.\n\nThis is a classic example of parents that want to be their kids friend when they are growing up instead of being their parent, then wonder why ..... their kids never seem to grow up.", "NTA!!!

You are in a very tough spot especially with the danger of a potential baby with no suitable parents. You might consider seeking out a good family therapist and getting some guidance from them. See if your son can go with you, maybe after you can set aside your understandable frustration and approach the therapy as a way to get your relationship with him back on track and not as a \u201clet\u2019s fix Junior\u201d thing. Because no one will change unless they want to. \n\nYou can and should have boundaries around your home such as no giving out security codes, everyone contributes to keeping the place clean, adults have jobs or go to school. It sounds like you are keeping the door open within reason for your son.", ">sometimes we men \n\nActually I think that goes for everyone not just men", "Thank you!", "Because at the same time I feel horrible. Thank you!", "He knows I\u2019m here for him if he gets a job and all of that. I didn\u2019t stop service on his cell. He talks shit about everyone then nice to their faces as well. He knows he needed to pay for insurance on my truck when I added him, his cell phone which is now under my name, and other things but he wants to get a high paying job when he doesn\u2019t have the skills and work history is not good. I\u2019d never truly disown my kids, I\u2019m just tired of the bs.", "Thank you!!", "Thank you!! I hope it does as well. It would be great for him to get a sense of how he has been acting and change. We live in a small town that is very expensive.", "Thank you!! I appreciate it. I just hope he learns. His twin is stressed from this and so am I. I miss him walking through the door and knowing for sure that he\u2019s safe.", "He moved in with someone. I wouldn\u2019t leave him homeless. He had somewhere to go.", "He has no car that works. I\u2019ve told my kids to work closer to our house. The other two do. I work as well. When he gets a running vehicle then he can choose where to work concerning distance.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s saying he has a say on the bc. But if he\u2019s gonna allow them to be together under HIS roof and states that they should be careful, they should definitely be protective and understand that if necessary they should take bc. Now they don\u2019t HAVE to take bc, but it\u2019s a better option for ppl who are usually lazy and don\u2019t care for rubbers, routine pills etc. (also most kids are dicy and rather go raw.. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s her idea too but they just both don\u2019t care ? ).", "She refuses to use birth control. Well they don\u2019t work, her mother doesn\u2019t work and if they have a baby it is me that would have to pay for everything. Because they are being irresponsible and if you are gonna have sex in my house and play adults then go by my rules. Get on BC or move out and figure life out.", ">Pretty obvious a baby would become the OP's problem. That gives OP a right to be concerned about her son and his girlfriend's birth control regime. You've gone off on what is obviously a personal trigger for you, but that does not address the dilemma being discussed here.", "Thank you!! Thank you for sharing your story! Glad it worked out for you!!!", "How is he to get there? He has no car. He has had jobs and screws around and looses. He is staying with a friend for now. He refuses to get help.", "Thank you. I hope you get happier!", "I didn\u2019t say where I want like what type of job but in the area where we live like on this side of town so he can get there. His twin works at a job near the house and his sister does on this side but he refuses to do what is needed. \n\nIf he got a job on the other side of town, how is he to get there with no vehicle and it isn\u2019t like his friends will just get up and give him a ride? \n\nI\u2019ve been a parent to him and tried to guide him and explained things to him but he wants to argue and thinks he knows everything instead of listening and watching. He gets jobs and looses them for screwing around.", "It\u2019s never ending struggle. Sorry you go through that.", "Thank you!! I will call soon!!", "Is public transportation an option?", "He texted me today saying I told her to get on the pill when there are other options. I stated I wrote birth control and had talked to her about an IUD. Yeah, they don\u2019t care.", "It\u2019s fine to not want to be responsible for them. But you have plenty of reasons to draw the line without deciding that you also need to insert yourself into her healthcare decisions. Don\u2019t pay for them, don\u2019t provide a home rent free, don\u2019t pay for resources for them. But also don\u2019t tell someone that they need to take hormonal birth control because you say so. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong to not want to be physically or financially responsible for them.", "I took the bus for an hour to get to my job on the other side of the city. I'd probably act out, too, if I had a really unsupportive parent like you if I'm gonna be honest. I asked a question and you proceeded to continue to put blame on your son which is irrelevant to the answer.\n\nI mention family counseling and you say he refuses to get help while deflecting from yourself. It sounds like you also aren't interested in helping your situation with your family.", "The last paragraph you wrote.  It is YOUR job as a parent to stop the arguing and tell him to stop and learn.  It is your job as a parent to make him listen, it is YOUR job as a parent to MAKE decisions for him as he is growing up, then provide influence when he has moved out.  \n\nSorry, not getting that vibe off you at all.  Remember, you came here asking for opinions, dont ask if you dont think you will like the answers.", "If it was the OP wouldn\u2019t have had to make the suggestion in the first place. Or the kid is just not willing to take it.", "No. We don\u2019t have that here as in busses. I have a friend that does Uber and he refused that too.", "Not all bc is hormonal.", "I have helped him. I just spent $300 yesterday getting his car that doesn\u2019t work so he can sell it. We don\u2019t have buses here and I work so how is he going to get to work with no ride? I have asked him about getting therapy and he said no because the therapy won\u2019t help for it isn\u2019t good per what his gf says.", "Well, he is 19. So, he argues with all and he doesn\u2019t listen. He thinks he knows best so, I guess it is time for him to live in the real world and figure it out. \n\nHis twin works, his sister too and all raised the same. He just wants to do what he wants to do.", "True, but even the non hormonal aren\u2019t without side effects.\nIs your son diligent about using condoms? Definitely not 100% effective, but at least he can take steps to prevent a pregnancy he cannot afford.", "Ok, good luck", "Idk he won\u2019t talk about it so that\u2019s why I said about her getting an IUD because she is irresponsible and very immature.", "Thank you!!", "She\u2019s not the only one responsible for preventing pregnancy. Why not focus more on talking to him about doing his part than on her?", "So she has to go through a painful & expensive medical procedure in case your son can\u2019t buy condoms? I see where he gets his attitude from.", "Huh? Having a baby is painful and getting the IUD or the one in the arm is a lot less painful and it is no cost to her. If she took BC pills she would forget and it would actually help her get pregnant.", "Or they can use condoms which aren\u2019t painful at all?", "I was told they do but never seen any and he won\u2019t talk about it. Condoms need vaginal film as well. And not sure if they have where they take the chance and use nothing. It would be better so she wouldn\u2019t have her period and the cramps to get an iud or the one for the arm and not worry so much.", "YTA for tell him he no longer your son. NEVER say that to your child. blood or not. bad behavior or not.", "No one makes a fuss when birds kick their young from the nest. You didn\u2019t kick him.", "You can kick him out and make him stand in his own two feet without disowning him,  without telling him he isn\u2019t your son, without communicating that your love is conditional.\n\nNot TA for kicking him out at all. \n\nYTA for everything else.", "NTA. While \u201cdisowning\u201d him was not great, I\u2019m sure you were frustrated with the situation.  \n\nBe wary if he and GF come back with a baby and want to move back in.", "YTA\n\nNot for kicking him out but for your ableist comments about depression, ADHD and anxiety. \n\nDepression is a debilitating illness and you shouldn\u2019t be so callous when talking about it. That being said, you also wouldn\u2019t be doing your son any favours by babying him his entire life.", "Setting clear expectations is not an a-hole move.  You should be clear with him exactly why you are asking him to leave and what your expectations are.  Since he and his girlfriend refuse to do anything, you are likely too be in charge of caring for their child as well.  I like how Dr. Phil says if you don\u2019t have a job you should be spending 8 hours a day looking for one.  I\u2019m going to have to have a similar conversation w my autistic daughter\u2026you are either enrolled in college or you have a full time job.", "NTA. He is an adult. If he still wants to live at home there are rules he has to follow or he can leave. He is lazy doesn't want to work, not going to school, engaging in unprotected sex with a mentally ill girlfriend, has other assholes over disrespecting you and your household.", "I know I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I do feel horrible. I had added he can go be his gf moms son since he will tell her I yelled at them and I didn\u2019t then she would want to whip my ass with the man of the week while high on drugs.", "Yes! Very frustrated. I\u2019m sure he will be back in a few days. His gf cannot though. She isn\u2019t allowed at the house.", "Why my comments about them? I have them as well. I even went to hospitals and still held a job. He refuses to get help. Can\u2019t have those as an excuse.", "I did make it clear. There were other reasons I didn\u2019t say on here as well. Yes, having autism doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the person can\u2019t function. He wants to go to a trade school. He wants things out of life it is just he is skipping a lot of steps and then the way he thinks becomes an argument.\nHe is a good child otherwise and has a huge  \u2661 but has become an asshole since being with this girl.", "Did I say it\u2019s an excuse? I think I said the opposite. It\u2019s the comments about attention seeking and being a man that get me.", "I\u2019m not trying to be callous. I\u2019ve tried for months, years to get him help for all 3. He refused meds to help focus. I suggested behavior therapy to get skills if able. Attention seeking was about the gf and yes, he needs to man up if that\u2019s what you are talking about unless you read where I wrote about her mother being with the man of the week.", "Having a child leave on bad terms is no small thing. I know 40 year olds who still have it weigh on the relationship with their parent heavily. I don\u2019t know all the details. However I\u2019d consider him giving away your door codes and having randos come in and out of your house to be cause enough. \n\nBut one thing though. It\u2019s nonsensical for you to hold his GF\u2019s problems against him. I would however be EXTREMELY clear that if he knocks her up, they are not going to live with you, you will not financially support them and his choices will be homelessness or the military.", "You recognize that you \u201cwent overboard\u201d with the angry comment, so forgive yourself for that and apologize to him for it. \n\nBeyond that, you did the right thing pushing him out of the nest.  \n\nHe will handle the situation however he chooses and I sincerely hope he comes to his senses and makes the necessary demands on himself to grow up.  \n\nAt 19 he needs to make a bunch of grown up decisions and choices instead of stagnating. \n\nIf and when he gets his act together, he\u2019ll thank you for being so strong now.  \n\nWe used to call it \u201cTough Love\u201d and it\u2019s very painful for everyone, but it works to A) give young adults motivation they lack to become autonomous and B) give parents the next phase of their lives.  \n\nNTA"]}
