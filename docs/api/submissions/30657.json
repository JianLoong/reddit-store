That's the behavior of a person displaying confidence and self assurance. You know, the literal opposite of intimidation. \n\nNTA.

Someone doesn't get to ask you to leave somewhere you have a right to be, when you are minding your own business, because they feel uncomfortable.

The fact that she was mad at even that compromise is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThat's pretty ballsy to tell someone else to leave the gym when they're the one that's uncomfortable.

Maybe she did feel intimidated and uncomfortable but *since that wasn't caused by any bad behavior on your part* you're not to blame for that.\n\nI'm also always puzzled by those women who, when scared of a man, confront him. Like, if you were really a danger, wouldn't confronting you be the stupidest thing to do?\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA. She wasn't intimidated, she just wanted to be alone. I can assure you as a woman that when I feel intimidated or unsafe, I DO NOT approach the person making me feel that way.", "I have to go with NTA, you did nothing wrong.

If you were working out in a gym in a remote area and a man OR woman larger/stronger than you came in, and you asked him to wait, and he/she said no and worked out anyways, I wouldn't think either person was an asshole. I don't think it was a huge deal that she asked, and I don't think it was a huge deal that he said no.", "I hear you. \n\nI think I considered OPs perspective, and I said he wasn't an asshole for saying no. \n\nI also suggested that they get to know each other. But I guess I'm supposed to see things in a black and white manner: someone must be the asshole. \n\nThe difference is that one person felt intimidated due to a presumed size/strength differential (and potentially a past assault by someone larger), and what you're countering with has to do with something purely cultural. \n\nI don't see how she implicitly accused him of violent intent. She said she felt intimidated, she didn't say he was threatening her.", "I said larger male so the comparison doesn't make sense.", "Well yes, you seem entitled yourself based on your suggestion he should be her friend so he can protect her and help her feel better.\n\nIt's no surprise you don't recognise something as entitled.", "But that\u2019s exactly what she did.", "I (33f) think It was an entitled question it\u2019s a communal gym. Asking someone to leave like it was hers was wrong and in a way confrontational so her \u201c uncomfortable\u201d comment makes little to no sense. And he was nice enough to offer to ad distance. She just wanted the gym to herself I feel like. NTA I would go with a friend or during a busy time. Which is actually what I do.", "I mean, you\u2019re really not putting yourself in the guy\u2019s shoes here. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much energy\u201d, quite invalidating.\n\nI don\u2019t think there would be many people who wouldn\u2019t give it another thought. Not everybody will be questioning themselves, that\u2019s true! Most would cope another way, including antagonizing the woman in their mind or with their friends for validation. Tbh, I can\u2019t imagine many people just saying \u201cno\u201d and immediately returning to their previous mental state.", "See I think it\u2019s a big deal to ask. I feel like I would make a gay guy feel bad if I told him I wanted him to leave in a space that he\u2019s allowed to be in. It\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s gay, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, and it\u2019s ONLY my I\u2019m stupid and can\u2019t get over my issues. That\u2019s my fault. I don\u2019t understand why it would be okay for people to make other people unwelcome and feel bad to benefit yourself.", "That is a very obvious distinction without a difference.", "OK, white person scared of larger black person. Oh, and he's wearing a *hoodie*. Surely I'm in the right to be totally fucking terrified now, right?", "It absolutely makes sense. You're implying that if she was afraid of a black man and was a white woman and asked him to leave she would be within reason. No. That's racist.", "You're twisting my words. \n\nI said maybe they could become friends and work out together. \n\nI thought they could both benefit from it, not just her.", "She made a request and accepted him saying no. Did she go to their employer and get him banned from the gym?", "I would too. I wouldn't have asked that, but I don't think she's entitled for making a verbal request. Agree to disagree. \n\nThe inconvenience/cost of women having to go the gym (or anywhere) with another person to protect themselves is rooted in actual facts that I don't think should be disregarded. \n\nAlso, to repeat, I said he wasn't an asshole.", "It's strange to me that you think it's invalidating to point out a fact. He said what happened. It didn't take hours out of his day. He didn't pull his hair out over it. He asked about it on Reddit. \n\nIf you look at most of the comments here, you will see tons of people calling her stupid, sexist and entitled. Does it seem to you like these people are concerning themselves with how she felt? Even you refer to the cost of him having to take time to even just consider something, like someone else's feelings.\n\nEdit: I stand corrected", "You wouldn't know he was gay. If you were assaulted by a man, your body will likely react to men in general, even if you don't know they're gay. \n\nIt's not \"stupid\" that you have a physiological response due to trauma, and it isn't your fault. Trauma responses are pre-cognitive - your body reacts before you can rationalize what's going on. \n\nWe can't structure society around everyone's individual traumas, but we can be personally empathic to people's differential experiences. I see nothing wrong with having compassion, even if you're entitled not to.", "What? You can keep putting words in my mouth if you want. \n\nI think if someone is working out in an empty gym in a remote location next to a camp, it's not a huge deal to ask another person who comes in to wait until they're done. Especially if they are much bigger. And I don't think that person would be a dick for saying no.", "She asserted a superior right to use the gym exclusively. She did try to ban him from the gym.", "This sub is extremely female dominated. Lol. You\u2019re inventing issues.", "> It might have been more useful to specifically ask women to get their perspective, but alas.\n\nIt's telling that, regarding the question of whether it's entitled for women to presume the right to dismiss men from public spaces, you imply that only women's opinions are valid.\n\nAnd yes, there are real costs to a man in that situation, which you refuse to acknowledge: the experience of facing an expectation to behave like a second-class citizen, the apprehension that the person claiming to be intimidated by you (while confronting you) might be unhinged and react to your refusal by making false allegations etc. There's more to it than just her feelings.", "It\u2019s not any better if it\u2019s gender rather than orientation I\u2019m reacting to, I\u2019m wary of men in general but it\u2019s a million times worse if I read them as or know they are gay. It\u2019s bigotry, and it\u2019s wrong to feel like I\u2019m entitled to make them feel bad about being who they were born just because I can\u2019t get over what happened to me. I would leave if I was asked to by a woman because I don\u2019t stay where I\u2019m unwanted and I don\u2019t like making people feel bad, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right if I did that based on how someone was born.", "OK, and the rest of the world that isn't socially inept disagrees. Your discomfort is your responsibility, and no one else's. If you're not comfortable being in a remote location, take a job closer to home.", "It absolutely is a huge deal. It isn't your gym.", "She did not. She ASKED a question, and then left when he said no. If she had banned him from the gym, he wouldn't have stayed and continued to work out.", "Did she confront and dismiss him, or ask a question? That's how I remember it being presented. Maybe I missed something. \n\nI can't imagine why either of them would see each other as unhinged. It was a brief exchange about her discomfort and he said no, so she left. \n\nHe's not an asshole for saying no. It was totally his right. And I think there might be a decent solution to two people who use the same gym in  a remote area at the same time.", "Sure, it's worse if you know they are gay because you were (I assume) sexually assaulted. If you were specifically physically attacked, you'd be wary of all men equally - but actually not, because you'd be wary primarily of men who could obviously overpower you. It's just physics. And that's why it's not the same as if it was about race or something purely cultural. \n\nIf I was a huge muscley woman, and I walked into a remote gym, and a male who was half my size (and was the only one there) asked me to wait for an hour, I'd say \"sure\" and come back in an hour. It's just not that difficult for me to consider others' needs, even if it's a bit entitled, as long as it's not a huge inconvenience.", "She left the gym man lol. She took her discomfort elsewhere. \n\nI'm fine with disagreement. And it doesn't make me inept, socially or otherwise, for not subscribing to the majority view on something.", "That\u2019s absurd. Framing something as a question does not automatically make it reasonable, as has been repeatedly pointed out to you elsewhere in the thread. You\u2019re being deliberately obtuse.", "Asking someone to leave a public space is confrontational by its very nature. Confronting someone while claiming to be intimidated by them is irrational, and irrational behaviour is on a spectrum. It's hard to tell whether a stranger is just a little irrational, or unhinged.\n\nI wonder if you'd like to address my point that you seem to imply only women's opinions are valid in this matter?", "My SA doesn\u2019t give me the right to be bigoted. It just makes me a bad person because I should have it managed and fixed. I don\u2019t think women are really bigoted, per say, if they ask a man to leave but I feel as though it\u2019s inappropriate and entitled."]}
