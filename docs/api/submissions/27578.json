And instead of respecting her boundary you lashed out at her. \n\nAfter all this time you are yet to apologize for lashing out at her and your sister is still yet to meet your partner so of course she wouldn't be happy with you and wouldn't bring her kids she is not punishing you for the sake of punishing you she is giving you consequences for the way your treating her its not the same", "YTA her kids are not safe with you, that\u2019s the bottom line. You get into relationships with guys who sound like they\u2019re unsafe ( if they\u2019re restraining order territory) and frankly it sounds like you also have rage issues too and are a jerk in general. The kids and their safety always comes first. I wouldn\u2019t let you pet sit let alone baby sit by what you gave in your post.", "So she called you out on your lie with the truth and you told her to fuck off.  That would make you TA.", "YTA She\u2019s protecting her kids because you choose men who are dangerous. You wanted restraining orders against them, that means you were frightened of them. Your sister\u2019s job as a mom is to protect her kids, and until you make better decisions, she\u2019s protecting them from you.", "YTA.  Your bad life choices have made her leery about bringing her kids around you and justifiably so.  You wanted restraining orders and the police were called in your last three relationships.  Once, hey, sh\\*t happens.  Twice, that's on you.  Three, well, that's a pattern of picking questionable types.\n\nOr maybe you're the one at fault and the guys were fine.  You sound super angry and what are the chances that your last three boyfriends were all at fault.  After all, there was only one thing in common in all three relationships - you.\n\nEither way, your sister is officially low contact with you and she has made her kids no contact.  If you don't want it to be no contact with the entire family, clean up your act.", "Yes YTA. It sounds like you have shitty taste in boyfriends and your sister is over it.", "Op you forgot that you had restraining orders on three different men? You shouldn't be around any children, wtf", "YTA\n\nYour judgement in regards to boyfriends is suspect, and you *lied* about it, then told her to fuck off when she proved you lied.

You got pissed and that's understandable but she had good reason to ask to meet your boyfriend first. She wasn't trying to hurt you she just wanted to be certain her kids would be fine.\n\nAnd to answer \"What does her kids have to do with it?\" From her perspective you're putting your hurt feelings and your new relationship before the safety of her kids. Because the fact that you got mad and refused her request to meet your boyfriend beforehand that's a clear indication to her that you value your relationship with your boyfriend over the relationship you have with her and her children. That likely hurt her just as much as she hurt you. You should apologize and schedule a time for her to meet your boyfriend", "YTA.  Here's the truth, she gets to decide if her kids are around your bfs.  That's how that is.

She is protecting her children from not only some random man in your life, but also from them getting close to him and thinking he's another cool guy.  Kids get attached and it's unfair to pull that rug out from them again and again.  \n\nThen you proved her right by being a psychopath.  Way to alienate your family.", "YTA.

I wouldn\u2019t let you near my kids either, regardless of how close we were- and it\u2019s doubtful the closeness would last long.

YTA.", "Yikes. Of course YTA. You have a history of picking guys you end up having to call the cops on and get restraining orders against, and then you tell her to F herself for pointing that out? And yet you\u2019re all shocked Pikachu face that she doesn\u2019t want her kids in that kind of environment or around you?", "YTA, it does not matter what your prior relationships were like she has every right as a mother to meet a person before she introduces her children to them.

It\u2019s called good parenting.", "YTA it is perfectly reasonable for your sister to want to meet your boyfriend before her kids do. That's normal parenting. Your reaction was so unhinged and over the top. No wonder she's questioning your ability to make good judgement calls. You flew off the handle and were incredibly hurtful and insulting. Yet you're painting yourself as the victim in this post. You are not a victim here, you are the perpetrator.", "YTA. Of course she doesn't want her kids to meet your boyfriend before she does, if previous boyfriends needed restraining orders. Be reasonable.", "YTA - not only do you appear to have dubious taste in partners, but you also appear to have anger management issues, both of which are almost certainly making your sister wary and worried about what might happen to her kids if she left them with you.", "YTA.\n\nMen who are volatile enough with you that you wanted and/or received protective paperwork will hurt children. You have a pattern of socializing with people who will hurt or could kill her children.", "YTA. Please get therapy. You have poor choice in boyfriends.

Fuck you today, fuck you tomorrow and fuck you next week\u201d. \n\nWhat exactly were you trying to convey with these words? What did you hope the result would be? If someone said that to me, I'd assume they didn't want to see me anymore - and I sure wouldn't want to see them ever again. \n\n> She said she would only come for an hour as she does not want to be around me and she \u201cdefinitely doesn\u2019t want her kids around me\u201d.\n\nThis is way beyond the boyfriend issue now. The problem is you and your anger issues & inability to have a calm discussion when things don't go your way. \n\nHer request  to meet your boyfriend was reasonable given your past relationships. But instead of understanding, you denied your history then got angry when she was able to prove it. You must have a reputation for denying things that have happened and that's probably why your sister kept screen shots. \n\nI've known people who act like you. They have either a personality disorder or a drug/alcohol problem. Perhaps that's not true in your case, but something is fueling your rage.\n\nedited: YTA", "YTA and seek therapy", "Yta, your sister is protecting her children.

None of that recommends you as a babysitter. She's quite likely worried for her children's safety if left with you and I fully agree with her.", "Uhmm.  YTA.  \n\nLike when she points out your alleged bad taste in men and wants to meet the guy first before hand, you then go into a horrific expletive filled rant against her.

She knows that you get in dangerous situations and you don't take means to protect yourself. Why would she let you around her kids if you can't even look after yourself. Jesus Christ  YTA.", "So the situations were bad enough that you considered restraining orders even if you didn't get them OR you were exaggerating & being a drama queen. \n\nThe first scenario means you have a lifestyle that's not safe. The second scenario means you are exhausting.", "That just makes it worse. Your judgment is really so horrible. In addition, you\u2019re a liar with a very quick temper. Your sister is right to avoid you and to keep her children away. Stop making excuses.", "That's SO much worse!! \"hey sis, I took a step to prevent harm to myself and my family! lol PSYCH, I don't give a shit about my own safety or anyone else's, and these violent men have full ability to harm us all! Woohoo!\"\n\nAlso I think you might be lying to us. You told us you owned up to her when she showed you the texts. If you had falsely owned up, you would have mentioned it in your post. It wasn't till after we started criticizing you that you mentioned this little fact. \n\nAlso... you just so happened to lie to her about three restraining orders when they happened? Sure ya did.", "Highlighting what you are responding to\n\n> that's a clear indication to her that you value your relationship with your boyfriend over the relationship you have with her and her children\n\nThis means your sister does not trust you in the case your boyfriend turns out to be a bad guy and hurts her kids you will even protect them.\n\nThat you would even actively lie and pretend he didn't do anything.\n\nLet that sink in.", "She doesn\u2019t want me there after this last fight.", "Yeah, responding in such a hostile and aggressive way to a legitimate concern isn't a great sign that the kids are safe around OP and her partners.", "And lying shows that she cares more about getting what she wants than the safety of the kids.", "I wonder why. \n\nWhat was stopping you from visiting on your own before if these kids are so important to you?", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t want you there either. \n\nYour judgement on who you date leaves much to be desired and she is a Mother first.\n\nIn fact, you\u2019d have 0 chance of seeing your nieces/nephews for the rest of your life if you were my sister and spoke to me like that."]}
