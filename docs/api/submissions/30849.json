My parents are currently out of town and so it was just me and my sister. My sister has a tenancy of leaving her keys behind/losing them and usually we have to open for her. She was going out for a party Friday night and I warned her to triple check that she had her keys before she left. Surprise surprise, she left the keys behind so she called me at like 3am drunk and telling me to open up for her. Getting up is missions in my condition and I'd warned so I told her straight up that I wasn't coming downstairs to open for her so she should call a friend and stay there for the night, hung up then put my phone on DND. She screamed my name for awhile until one of the neighbors told her to stfu and so she, instead of calling a friend, decided to sleep in the old dog bed outside. Found her there in the morning and woke up her up to get inside. She was hella pissed and yelled at me for making her sleep in the dog bed. She also found a tick on her later and blames that on me too. \n\nWe've been fighting back and forth over this and so here we are for some impartial voices. I feel bad that she slept outside but also feel like that was poor choice on her part.

Once I was up, I was NOT coming down.  \n\nThe sister is having a learning experience. If everyone will wake up and let her in regardless of whether or not she has her keys, it gives her no motivation to make absolutely sure she has them.  No, that wasn't fun for her.  Maybe now she'll remember to take her keys.   \n\nI have a personal protocol that before my butt moves out of the seat of the car, the car keys are hooked to my purse, and the first trip into the house puts the purse in its assigned place.

My dad is lovely and very kind and caring but can't do a lot physically to help me as he is disabled (has an above the knee amputation and older prosthetic leg) and every step he takes is painful and he also struggles with terrible nerve pain in his stump (residual limb) as well as having the bottom of it where the skin was folder over and sewen shut split open constantly meaning he has a perpetual deep wound on the part of his stump that carries all of his body weight and he needs to move and use to make his mechanical knee function. When people ask about his condition, I describe his experience of walking like this: imagine that you are 200 lbs and every step you take is being done on your bare elbows on hard pavement covered in lots of sharp gravel. It makes every step you take count and you have to be very calculated in what you do and how you do it just to manage the basic necessities of your day. When you live like that you really start to reassess how important things are to you, like cooking a proper meal or showering daily, cleaning the house, etc. it makes a lot of things fall by the wayside. A lot of people see how some advanced prosthetic legs have really helped amputees and so assume that's how it is for all amputees and sadly it's just not the case, many people can't use the more advanced prosthetics or simply don't have access to them. That example I gave doesn't even touch on nerve pain or other things amputees can have going on but I think adequately describes how it feels for him to walk. Also he falls a LOT and when you don't have a leg, you can't catch yourself to break your fall, you just slam down and often break ribs.\n\nAnyway, So I would have to be beyond desperate and truly near death to ask him to physically help me move my body or bring me stuff.  Anyway, after being discharged and coming home I had no choice but to drag myself crawling, crying and moaning in pain to get up the stairs and then was stuck up there for a week. We managed by him setting food and drink for me on the highest stair he could reach, or my younger sister brought stuff up when she wasn't at school. Thank goodness for those commode / shower chairs and a walker. Those allowed me to manage in the bedroom and bathroom but it was absolutely hell on earth. Being disabled and only having another disabled family member to rely on, especially one who is much worse off than you is such a scary position to find yourself in. I'm going through it again right now with eye issues/surgeries and losing my vision to genetic bs, it makes everything so much scarier. It's hard for him too as he wants to help and support me but is stuck watching me struggle because he simply can't help me how I need, through no fault of his own.\n\nEven now with all my issues I routinely push my body past its pain threshold and physical limits to help him with things because I know no matter how much I'm struggling and suffering him trying to do the same task will hurt and exhaust him 20 fold. Luckily he's the most understanding person I know about pain and physical limits and reminds me to not push myself and to slow down and do things at the pace my body requires but I'm stubborn and life doesn't always allow that. \n\nIn regards to the nurse yelling at you, she's totally right, my neurosurgeon said I shouldn't lift or carry anything heavier than a home/office phone. It's very common after back surgery to herniated a disk (or reherniate the disk they just cleaned up) if you push your body. Also most back surgeries involve cutting through your muscles that support your core so its very easy to get hurt. I feel for you and hope you're doing better. :) back stuff sucks sooooo much.\n\nI feel for OP here and can't really say she is wrong, only she knows her condition and the sacrifice required to go down stairs at that time to help sis and so she's in the best position to make the decision.

It's not as black and white as that and I really don't like when people tell other people what someone with disabilities is capable of without talking to that person first, it causes so many unnecessary issues, misunderstandings and often rude and invasive remarks.

Please be aware that many disabilities and issues are not outwardly apparent to others and if you see me doing something I very well might be pushing my body beyond its limit due to desperation and then won't be able to walk or move for 2 days afterwards. Injuries and disabilities are complicated and we should defer to and believe the person experiencing it when they say what they can and can't do and know that is the answer for that specific moment, not an always rule.

It\u2019s heartbreaking knowing that today\u2019s kids are less likely to get the kind of help I got from that teacher.", "Yeah I understand the more secure part of it, just personal preference too", "How would OP know she didn't call anyone if he had the gall to turn off his phone knowing his sister was drunk and outside?\n\nYou all don't love your family, man. I'd rather fall down the stairs again and call 911 than letting my little sister fending for herself at night, drunk, in the cold and without a way to communicate with me in case of an emergency. \n\nYell at her all you want in the morning. Glue her keys to her neck if needed be. Don't leave a woman outside to potentially get sick, kidnapped, raped or even die because you want to say \"I told you so\" in the AM.", "He says he went down the stairs the next morning, which means he was alone as his parents were out of town\n\nDude was just being a dick.", "And a broken arm don't forget. It makes it even more difficult and dangerous", "And that would still be better than leaving the sister outside where should could be raped or kidnapped or murdered since she was drunk! Wtf, how do people not understand the possibilities...\n\nIdk man, no matter how much I hated my sister, I'd never leave her alone at night. If I broke both my legs, I'd rather call the damn cops to come and help her than leave her outside alone.", "No one said OP was responsible for her sister\u2019s drinking.\n\nSometimes people make poor choices, but that doesn\u2019t mean we make them suffer disproportionate consequences, especially when it\u2019s possible not to. As people are saying, if it had been cold or a high-crime area, would it really be an appropriate punishment for drinking and being irresponsible about one\u2019s keys to freeze to death or be assaulted? Obviously not.", "You can yell at her the whole next day and youd be fine, but putting her in a potentially unsafe situation that you can get her out of to punish her isnt the answer. Drunk people dont behave rationally.", "Whats the maximum amount of effort you would be willing to put in to help a family member or friend in a vulnerable situation they got themself into?", "I have a sister. I wouldn\u2019t want her to freeze, be assaulted, or get Lyme disease in pursuit of \u201clearning a lesson\u201d no matter how much I think she needs to learn. This is a weird take.", "So dramatic.  In fact, it is pretty common behavior related to the combination of immaturity and intoxication.  It happens to almost everyone at least once in their lives.  I\u2019m saying the price may have been too high for the low possibility that she taught her little sister anything at all.  It\u2019s just not how we learn our lessons.", "Does that address the potential consequence of leaving a drunk women (who in theory OP cares about at least a little) locked out in the middle of the night?", "She could have been assaulted or mugged on the way home, thereby losing her keys. According to OP and you, that\u2019s just too bad and she should still have to sleep outside. \u201cComes with the territory\u201d or something reading your replies", "Exactly!", "More lmao cause this is my kids with their dad and I.  It was a constant one up between us and they played the game right along.  I love it.", "...barefoot...", "So, who's going to be awarded the Darwin Award for this forced devolution? :-D", "I'm sorry but I laughed about the tick....", "Just make her wear the collar and tell her it's sexy. Some people definitely think it is so it's not even lying!", "One of my kids ended up at The Carroll School.  A private school for only dyslexic kids.  Actually, they are the place that developed Orten Gillingham, the gold standard for teaching dyslexic kids.  The comorbidity for dyslexia and ADD appears to be high, from what I\u2019ve seen (is there research?  Dunno, but, so many of those kids clearly had ADD) So, while my kid was there, they came up with NCLU.  \u201cNo child left unorganized\u201d (a pun on NCLB). They had a last period, homeroom (5-7 kids), that was 5minutes long, where the teacher checked in with them to make sure they had their homework, books, laptop, plugs, etc.  Just a quick thing to try to help them be successful.   \n\nThey all had IEPs, obviously.  They could all have extra times on tests.  BUT, they taught self advocacy, in age appropriate ways. In 4th grade, as a math test was reaching the end of the period, they would be reminded that if they needed more time, they had to write MT at the top of the page. If they didn\u2019t, they couldn\u2019t have it. They were reminded, they didn\u2019t have to figure it out for themselves, or anything, they only had to cooperate.  When they wrote MT, the teachers arranged for the time, not them.  It was part of a gentle, ongoing, every day push towards independence.  I really liked that place!", "Let me rephrase that. He likely has help to make it FASTER and less painful. The sister knew she needed her keys. She's an ADULT. I was remembering to grab a key when I was 8 because I KNEW I needed it, just in case my parents weren't home. It's not that hard to remember a key", "with a broken leg, sometimes the stairs are a once a day thing. they're *draining* and op was probably exhausted from being woken up. \nnot defending him, id have busted my ass for my sister even in that state. but just explaining", "This!!!", "Again 'we make them suffer ' . Op didn't make her suffer squat she put herself in the situation it's not op s responsibility. \n\nAnd op told her to call a friend and go sleep at their house. The sister decided not to - again drink or not  her responsibility not op s .\n\nIt's not punishment it facing the consequences of your own actions.\n\nJust as you can't force anyone to do what you want including sober you can't force them to do so drunk.\n\nThey need to learn to be responsible for themselves.", "I\u2019m not sure why everyone keeps saying OP put her in this position. She made the sober choice to not leave the house prepared. She put herself in this situation. She is an adult. Not a child. At some point, she needs to be responsible for herself. What is no one was home at all? OP is only there temporarily and parents were out of town. Then who would you all put the blame on?", "- I just commented this somewhere else: Honestly, this would have been a different conversation if OP didn\u2019t have a broken leg and a broken arm to try to navigate the house and stairs with. He is there to recover, not to babysit an adult. She continuously makes the decision to forget her keys at home. This was the one time she needed to be responsible for herself and she wasn\u2019t. This is on her, sorry. Edit: spelling", "No one forced her to sleep outside. She had options, she chose not to utilize them out of spite.", "Honestly, this would have been a different conversation if OP didn\u2019t have a broken leg and a broken arm to try to navigate the house and stairs with.

She did not bring them when reminded. Again. For probably the hundredth time. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cwhoopsies I\u2019m always responsible and lost my keys\u201d moment. And she called OP. She could have just as easily called a friend- probably even one that was still awake from partying with her. Again, she figured out and arranged for herself to get home, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that she can make arrangements for herself for the night.", "While carrying 20 books and their sibling", "On my hands without gloves in the snow.", "My little brother is dyslexic (almost every male on my dads side is) and BOTH of our parents have ADHD, so we were screwed from the start\ud83d\ude02. I would\u2019ve killed for him to be in a program like that. I dragged him through school all the way from kindergarten until the end of his senior year when I left for marine corps boot camp. I found out the kid tried dropping out. I felt so bad because I thought the coast was clear for me to leave because he was on track to graduate.\n\nWhen I got that letter, I went out on a limb and requested to make a phone call home. It\u2019s not something you just\u2026 get to do. They actually let me, thank god. He got the ass chewing of a lifetime from myself and my drill instructors. He changed his mind pretty quick and graduated high school. \n\nA program like that would have been so nice for him. He\u2019s a fucking genius but he just can\u2019t read/write. Not a single day of college and he just got promoted to a mechanical engineer position at a major oil drilling company at 24 years old.", "That's about how I feel, I just think OP is a bad person for using his injury to punish his sister instead of just dealing with some pain. Dude is in a cast RN, should be used to pain AND probably has medication to alleviate it", "If Nobody was there then therw would be nobody to put the blame on, and if something did happen to her it would be her fault, but who gives a fuck about fault if something happened? If I left my sister outside when I could have helped her and something happened to her, I wouldn't be able to live with myself even if she put herself in that spot.", "We get it was on her, you don't need to be callous though.", "Sure,  I\u2019ve been the guy with the broken keg.  I get it.  If she knows her sister isn\u2019t able to find her keys, a loving sister would stash a key somewhere for the sister to find it.  3AM call \u201cI\u2018m locked out, let me in!\u201d  OP \u201cRemember, I put an extra key under the flower pot\u201d.  Immediate set of problems solved.  The bigger problem of having an immature sister with a binge drinking problem can be addressed after a goid night\u2019s sleep.  Someone has to choose to be the adult, and no one should be left to destroy her own life over a night out with friends.", "...and a bucket of coal, for the furnace.", "At Carroll, they are continually reminding them of all the famous architects and entrepreneurs who are dyslexic!  One dyslexic lawyer my family knows, David Boies, who doesn\u2019t take notes and speak from them.  So opposing counsel has trouble, as he questions witnesses on the fly, not following any rational pattern.  It\u2019s really hard to prep witnesses when he is going cross examine them!  My kids loved this. \n\nA dyslexic embroidery engineer, [Tricia Ngygen](https://thistle-threads.com), has put together many embroidery classes, lessons, and developed a whole series of reproduction cabinets, frames, and things.

My friends read them and taught me each chapter!  But I don\u2019t have issues writing, just reading non stories. I can decode or I can comprehend, just not at the same time. Stories and knitting patterns I can read fine. So, we assume my kid got the dyslexia from me, mine is just sub clinical.", "If nobody was there, there still would be someone to put the blame on.  The same person the blame is on if there were 100 people there.  The person who negligently left their keys behind.", "Maybe but OP could not help. OP was in a cast that makes going up and down stairs very difficult. A fact that the sister knew. If she didn\u2019t want to sleep on a dog bed, she could have brought her keys or phoned a friend.", "OP could have called the police. Let them know she had broken limbs and on pain medicine and unable to safely navigate the stairs at that time. Tell them you are worried for her safety. Something tells me a lot of people would consider OP the ass,  if she had done that and temperatures were above risk of hypothermia.", "Lmao so OP should have babied her? Be fucking real. Sister is AN ADULT. Not a silly 13 yo who sometimes forgets her house keys. She can hide her own keys."]}
