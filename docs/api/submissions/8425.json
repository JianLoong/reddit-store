We\u2019re not that close but we both share a love of reading. Anyway, I was reading said book whilst in the bath last week and it led to me accidentally dropping it into the tub.\n\nThe pages are ruined and the book has expanded quite a bit, but in my opinion it\u2019s still readable. Of course though, I still felt very guilty and I offered to replace it. She refused and said that I shouldn\u2019t worry about it- accidents happen after all- but now I\u2019ve found out that she\u2019s going behind my back and telling all our mutual friends about it. She isn\u2019t saying it directly but she\u2019s heavily implying that I didn\u2019t try to do anything about it.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m NTA but some of my other friends say I should just be the bigger person and replace her book- however I\u2019m feeling quite hurt by her words and am now very reluctant to purchase something for her.\n\nSo what should I do about it, should I just ignore it or just go ahead and buy her another book?\n\nEdit: \nI\u2019ve replied to a couple comments but I think it\u2019s better if I just add everything here so everyone can have all the information.\n\nFirstly, I offered to replace the book like 5 or 6 times but each time my friend told me to not worry and that it would just be a waste of money if I did decide to replace it- \u201cafter all I\u2019ve already read it\u201d she said to me multiple times.\n\nAlso, regarding the bath controversy; I often read books in the bath to relax a bit in the evening. My friend knows this and even does it herself.\n\nI also mentioned that those were probably my plans (i.e. I said something like \u201cI can\u2019t wait to read this book in the bath later\u201d) and she didn\u2019t show any expression of discomfort or whatever, in fact she slightly encouraged me by saying something like \u201cI\u2019m so jealous, I\u2019ve got work later so I don\u2019t have time to relax\u201d (jealous in like a friendly joking way)\n\nEdit 2: \nMany people are wondering if the book was extra special in some way (excluding the fact that it\u2019s a book she bought for herself) and are also wondering what the book actually was but no, it wasn\u2019t a special edition, nor was it sentimental. \n\nThe book I got wet was \u201copen water\u201d by Caleb Nelson. A beautiful urban fiction and romance book which deals with several important issues- {I would recommend}\n\nThis may also come across as defensive but I truly don\u2019t believe the issue lies in me reading the book in a bathtub. My friend has also read the books I\u2019ve lent her in the bath many times and though it may seem like I\u2019m careless with other people\u2019s books this is the first time I have ever even slightly damaged one of her books. \n\nI truly did feel bad and insisted on replacing it multiple times but each time she refused, so I just accepted it and moved on.", "created_utc": 1674835606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10moipl/aita_for_accidentally_destroying_someones_book/", "score": 4548, "replies": ["YTA - Buy her a new book.", "YTA you damaged borrowed property and returned it in a way worse condition than it was given to you in.

Sure, but I don't think not doing so automatically makes you the asshole.\n\nBut as to advice, it is obviously weighing on you so just go out and replace it.", "ESH. get on Amazon or some other book website in order a replacement and have it sent directly to her.

When you ruin an item of someone else, you shouldn\u2019t have to ask them if it needs to be replaced. Of course, it needs replaced.

You ruined her book and should definitely replace it.", "YTA. Asking her puts her in the position of being like \u201coh it\u2019s ok\u201d. Don\u2019t ask, just replace.

You OFFERED to replace it, implying that there's a world where you don't.  You don't offer to replace something like this, an object that's generally easy to purchase.  You say \"I'm replacing it, it's already been ordered\".  Of COURSE you should replace it, so why is it an offer?  That puts the pressure on her, because for whatever reason we put a lot of positive weight on people saying \"Oh, no worries, it was an accident!\" instead of \"Thank you, I appreciate you making up for your mistake.\"\n\nNeither of you is a monster.

Even if they say not too I'd have too, just to show them I respect the fact they lend a thing to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReminds me of when I was a young teen and borrowed a book from a friends older brother who was quite witty and loved to tease people. He agreed to let me borrow it \"..but bring it back in better condition.\" He confused the hell out of me for a moment before breaking into a laugh at my bewildered look.

If you aren't that close with someone don't take their things. Thats just rude. You gonna take someone things, ruin it and then lead off with \"we're not that close.\" Its almost an admission you didn't take reasonable care. \"offered\" to replace it. REPLACE IT.

You didn\u2019t take care of it! And it doesn\u2019t matter what YOU think about it\u2019s readability. You returned it to her worse than when she lent it to you. This is all \u201cme, me, me, me\u201d and nothing about the person who actually got their book ruined.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter that you feel butthurt she\u2019s telling the truth about you.

I returned her book and apologized.", "YTA\n\nYou should have already had a new book in hand when you returned hers. Return in the same or better condition than when you borrowed. Literally borrowing 101.", "Gentle YTA. Of course accidents happen and you didn\u2019t mean to drop it. However, the thing to do would have been to immediately buy a replacement and give her both. That would have shown more effort to make up for ruining her copy.", "Yta for not replacing the book at once", "You shouldn't have offered to replace it, you should have just replaced it.", "NTA...it sounds like you tried to do the right thing.  However, some people are really conflict averse and she may have told you to not worry about it when really she wants a new book.  Buy one and apologize again for any inconvenience and then just move on.", "YTA, for being careless with someone else's property.\nSeriously the bathtub?? \nRather offered to replace it, you SHOULD of that, without even asking.\n\n Regardless what she says, you damaged her book, you need to replace it.

She didn\u2019t take issue with anything when I said that and in fact said she was jealous (in that self-depreciating friendly way) I had time to relax that evening (she was very busy that night)", "NTA - you made a mistake, owned up to it, and offered to replace it.  (Better option would be to tell them after you replaced and not even asked your friend but that is still ok)\n\nYour friend declined and said it wasn't needed, then went around and talked dirty about it to others in the group.  That was the asshole bit.  \n\nCould you have done better, yes.  However, your friend has more blame in the situation because they went back on what they said after the fact.  \n\nTwo choices, buy the book and replace it, maybe save your friendship and the group friendship.  Don't buy the book and potentially blow up either that friendship or that group relationship - I might even consider this to be the better option considering she is acting shady about it now.  People like that tend to like the attention that drama and controversy bring and will even create it (possibly the case here)", "YTA replace it asap", "ESH but the true question is: why were you reading a book in the bath tub? Like, seriously, it's the only place indoor where you shouldn't bring a book.", "Soft YTA because I've done the exact same thing before, except it was a library book. I had to pay the fee for a new one. If you accidentally damage someone else's property, you either fix it or pay to have it fixed", "NTA. You ruined the book and offered to replace it. She said no. It's not your responsibility from that point on unless she changes her mind. Unlike what a lot of people are saying here, you aren't entitled to replace something that she doesn't want replaced. I know a few people who would just turn down the replacement even if it was already bought and keep shit talking because they like the drama. It never hurts to ask again, but unless that specific copy was sentimental in some way I don't think she has a good reason to be upset.", "YTA.", "Something similar happened to me once, I got caught in the rain with a friend's book in my bag, I had something in my bag (can't remember what) that mixed with the water stained the pages, it was totally readable but the pages werr stained, I didn't even think twice, I just bought a new book to my friend and kept the old one, it really is a no brainer. YTA", "ESH- everyone here should take responsibility for their actions. Yours should have been to replace it when returning it, but you did the second best thing and offered to. She declined multiple offers and should take responsibility for having done so by not intimating to others that you didn\u2019t try to mend the situation.\n\nSince you can only control your own actions- go get a used copy in good condition and send it to her.", "Don't take other people's property in the bath.

That being said, you're the bigger @H. You don't read a borrowed book in the bathtub, it's ok if it's your own, but not someone else's, just like you don't leave it open upside down, you use a bookmark. You take good care of things that aren't yours. And finally, if you do damage it, the correct thing to do is to get a replacement without asking.\n\nAs for what to do now: just replace the damn book. Without asking again, just do it. She may have acted shitty, but you DID damage it, after all.", "YTA. You took a borrowed book into the tub.

You've just said it yourself half of these issues on here are about different expectations from situations, well part of that is women being told to phrase things certain way and expecting other people to be on the same page, and men being taught typically other things and not having to be on the same page. Like, that's the clash. Women aren't meant to just come out and say yes buy me a new book, especially because of how many times usually we are direct about things and then mocked for being petty. If it's not important to other people, it's deemed as not important at all desipte if something is important to us.

You are doing yourself and the other person a disservice by doing that, and don\u2019t get to claim the moral high ground for it.

I\u2019m not gonna say no and then talk smack because I\u2019m acting like some kid saying no and then pouting cause I didn\u2019t get it. Some of y\u2019all peeps need to grow up. If the item is something pricy ok for sure no questions asked imma buy them a replacement or give them a gift card but it\u2019s a book man. Besides the whole gift card thing can be a little rude too, it implies you couldn\u2019t be bothered to buy them the book so have them buy it instead. OPs friend is a snowflake.

Clearly the borrower should try to look after it but it is not a big deal to replace it so taking a very small risk like reading it in the bath is fine.\n\nAfter ruining the book OP told the friend and offered to replace it repeatedly. The friend refused repeatedly. That's on them. If they want to tell the story they need to be honest and include that information. If I  have finished a book there is a good chance that I won't want it back, many people read books just once and pass them on. OP had no reason to disbelieve the friend. Friend is an AH they need to grow up. If you want your book replaced then be an adult and just say yes when offered repeatedly. Stop playing games. And whining about it after refusing OP's offer is dishonest. \n\nOP you are NTA but go buy this person the new book.

I think it was perfectly reasonable for OP to ask first. People are acting like that puts the lender in an awkward spot, but that's life...

Offering a different book as an alternative is a great idea.", "OP you were putting her on the spot by offering to replace her book instead of just going ahead and doing what was obviously the right thing in the first place.

That's just another layer of bad on top of all this stupidity.\n\nLike did they just want to get off on being angry about something? Dislike op and want them out of their friend group?

I know others might not be able to do that but I would find the money.", "Thanks!", "Except she's telling (or at least heavily implying) that OP made no effort to replace the book which is a lie.

He obviously did not want to replace it (afterall, she reads books in the bath too!). It's being nice in a can't be bothered having him replace the book way not a being nice in a saccharine sweet way because that is not her role here. Some may say it would be his role but this is evidently beyond his capabilities.", "That is literally the opposite of offering.

I agree OP should've replaced it but you don't tell someone not to worry about it and then hold a grudge about it.", "Apparently simply the act of communicating instead of reading minds is totes rude.\n\nAnd after someone tries to communicate and you turned down their offer 5-6 times, it's totally acceptable to talk sh\\*t behind their back.\n\nThe new rules of society are hard to grasp.", "If someone can't say what they mean, they shouldn't complain when they don't get what they want. It is absolutely the easiest thing to just say 'yes, please replace my book'. If someone says otherwise, then don't get them a replacement book.\n\nOP was a moron for bringing something that wasn't theirs into the bathtub (and I personally believe that op should have replaced the book without even asking), but op is not an asshole for not replacing a book that their friend said they did not want replaced.\n\n People can't read minds. No means no, not yes.", "I would ask her which books are on her bucketlist and buy one of them for her.", "YTA. How hard is it to say \u201cI accidentally destroyed your book, I\u2019m very sorry. I will replace it with the same version, or we can go to the book store together and buy you something new.\u201d\n\nAsking if you need to replace the book is the AH move. Probably everyone will decline. All you need to do is figure out how to replace it and do it.", "NTA. Though at this point I would probably just order a book sent to her house and text her something like \u201cSo and so mentioned that you said I hadn\u2019t offered to replace your book. You must have misunderstood me when we talked before, because I offered a bunch of times. I ordered a copy and it will arrive Thursday!\u201d. But I\u2019m also kind of a bitch so this might not be the right move for you", "YTA and if she doesn't want that specific book replaced because she already read it, give her a voucher so she can choose a different book for herself as a replacement.", "YTA. Librarian here. We would charge you for this book if you returned it to the library with water damage (or you could choose to replace it with the same or similar title). You can\u2019t return a damaged book to a library, and definitely not to your friend. You should either give your friend the money to pick out a new book, or replace the book. You could also let her pick out one of your books to keep as a way of making it up to her.", "You don't have to ask \"if you have to replace it\". Just replace it.", "So long as it's not a diamond necklace...\n\nI would be upset if someone destroyed one of my books, just because it's a book and OP shouldn't have been careless with it.

I need to buy her one of those racks you lay across the tub if I'm lending her anymore books!\" Sorta way.\n\nIf OP is so paranoid just buy a replacement, end of drama stress.", "YES!! My first thought! Why didn't you buy her a new book, then tell her sorry. Here's the ruined one and the new one!!", "Commented before I saw this.

But if they do you preemptively fixed it. \n\nThat just feels like a bad gamble in case the other person is chill.", "YTA  Saying 'don't worry about replacing it' is the accepted social nicety for many people. OP is failing to hear the unspoken social norms. Yes you should have replaced the book. And if she won't accept it (because that's the social norm) you should have wrapped it in a plastic bag and left it in her letterbox, or whatever the equivalent process is where you are.\n\nRefusing the offer is 'the polite thing to do', but that doesn't let you off the hook. You are liable for that book.", "I agree. Asking if a person wants you to do something that you are obviously obligated to do is practically fishing for a polite refusal.", "We assume OP took it as gossip, but the friend may have just been flabbergasted at the exchange if it's anything like how OP communicates here.", "That is why my question would not have been \"Do you want me to replace this book?\" But \"I am going to make this mistake up to you somehow and this is your chance to choose what I do. *How* do you want me to replace this book?\" Because I would make people angry or upset all the time and wouldn't understand what had gone wrong until later lol", "I literally don\u2019t loan a book out if I want it back. Got that advice years ago and have never regretted it. \n\nAny books I love and rec a lot, I buy any copy I see cheap at a thrift store/yard sale specifically SO I can send it off and never worry about seeing again.\n\nSaves a lot of heart ache and bad blood.", "But what if the person really doesn\u2019t care that you replace it and your just buying a book that\u2019s going to sit on a shelf wasting space. I would be upset if someone bought the new one without asking me because it\u2019s a waste of time and money and wasteful because I would still read the water logged one if needed. Also, communication. If she wanted it replaced, say it. It\u2019s a book not an ipad", "I honestly don't even think that the best thing to do is replace outright? I'd feel pretty bad if a friend spent money replacing something I didn't care about. I'd literally rather they ask.", "This was me when I was a nine-year-old kid.  My pet cockatiel chewed the edges of a book cover I borrowed from my grandma.  Of course I replaced the book that was damaged in my care.", "Right, people here are so black and white on things. Not only would I be a little annoyed if I'd said not to replace it and they did anyway, I'd also feel like it was just too big of a gesture to give me a whole gift card, nice though it would be! Accidents happen, it wasn't a book that was precious so please believe me when I say it's fine not to replace it!", "No, he should have just replaced it immediately. I'm guessing OP is burying the lede about how he offered.", "My mom was a bathtub reader in the 1970s.  All our books were lightly to heavily warped.", "I agree! If that was the case I'm sure she wouldn't have just given it to her friend without saying something like this is an important book please be careful with it. She offered and her friend refused...that should be the end of it.", "I would be at least disappointed if not pissed if someone's needlessly purchased a book to replace one of mine that they accidentally got all waterlogged (but still readable).", "NTA - you offered to replace it, she said she didn't want you to replace it. I see a lot of YTA because you're supposed to just replace it. Like WTF, no means yes and yes means yes? That's like saying \"she said no, but she really wanted it\". Can we all just communicate what we actually want instead of \"hinting\" and \"reading between the lines\"? No should mean no and nothing else.\n\nYou communicated clearly, she did not. It could be a cultural thing, but I would argue in today's world where cultures are so intertwined, an adult should be expected to communicate clearly and not go shitting behind another person's back. Say it to their face.", "Because most people who have already read the book *truly* wouldn't gaf that it wasn't being returned.  \n\nThey offered to replace it.  That's it.  That's all that needed to be done.", "I would be pissed if someone replaced a book that I loaned out (assuming it\u2019s not a special book)\u2026 using money on a book I already finished? I do would be pleasantly surprised by a new book gift, that I didn\u2019t read yet! That would be awesome :)", "OP offered to replace it multiple times, I think that if the friend wanted it replaced she could have said yes one of those times. She insisted she didn\u2019t want it replaced. What\u2019s OP supposed to do, keep pushing until the friend says yes? Give her money even though she says no? Buy a replacement book even with her saying it would be a waste?", "I would maybe ask her what other book she would like to have. The friend said that she already read it and it would be a waste, so why not replace with a book she doesn\u2019t have (but wants to read)? That would be the best option I think! \n\nNTA", "Who wants a new copy of a book they have already read? I would be embarrassed to accept that.", "The difference that you and everyone saying Y T A are ignoring is that it wasn\u2019t a car; it was, in fact, a book. Many people have books that they\u2019ve already read and don\u2019t care that much about and genuinely wouldn\u2019t want replaced with a brand new book in this kind of situation. Pretty much nobody feels that way about a car bumper.\n\nNow, some people would want their book replaced. That\u2019s fine! They\u2019re 100% entitled to feel that way and to a replacement book if they do. That\u2019s why OP asked if they should replace the book and was totally willing to replace it (you seem to ignore this in your comment because you make it sound like OP\u2019s\nposition is that they shouldn\u2019t have had to replace the book, period, which is wrong). It was reasonable not to assume and therefore not buy the book first. \n\nAlso, the funny thing about the car analogy is that even though the borrower would presumably have to pay for/replace the damaged bumper, the borrower would have to tell the borrowee about the damage BEFORE actually having the bumper replaced. They couldn\u2019t just return the car with the replaced bumper. So it flies in the face of the argument so many are making that \u201cOP should have already had the new book in hand when they told the friend what happened.\u201d In actuality, it\u2019s not crazy that OP would tell the friend what happened before having replaced the damaged item.", "Exactly", "This sort of highlights how OP's situation is  a grey area though--you paid 25 cents for it and it sounds like you truly didn't care that it was destroyed or if she replaced it. Would you really consider your friend and asshole if she took you at your word and didn't replace the book for you, or buy you a gift card?\n\nIt's a classy thing to do for sure, but I don't think NOT doing it makes someone an asshole...", "They make bath trays for this exactly, not sure why more people don't use them.", "My friend did her best to make up for destroying my property.\n\nOP didn't do anything to make up for ruining the book. \n\nIf OP was truly sorry, they should have replaced the book, asked if the friend wanted another copy or something else (because asking do you want A or B is very different than \"should I replace\"), or given a gift card along with an apology.\n\nInstead we have an OP that thinks they really aren't the asshole, claims that the friend isn't close, and justifies that a waterlogged book is still readable.", "Yeah exactly. If this happened to me (adult 35y old), I would have just told them what I thought. I probably wouldn\u2019t need a new copy of a book that I had already read, but I maybe would have wanted another book? \n\nA new book is like $20 or something, and not worth fighting over. They both seem to be reading in the bath and these things happens.", "I snorted at this. Honestly if someone gave me a book in this condition and made a half hearted offer to replace it, I'd wave them off too, because they clearly don't *want* to fix the issue. Wave them off and never loan a book to them again (OP says they're already not even close/actual friends), and yes, I'd tell my other friends - both to warn them that OP isn't going to actually care about the things they're borrowing, and to mourn my fallen book, regardless of value.", "But they are *your* books, you can do whatever you want with them. \n\nThe other person is ruining books that they've borrowed and then purchasing new copies without consideration for any significance the original copy may have had to owner. If they can afford the replacement copies, then they should just be buying their own books instead of ruining their friends' books.", "I really need more details of OP's approach with the offer of a new book for context. Had the friend seen the book when she said it didnt need replaced? Did OP justify how it was ok cuz it was still readable like in the post? Because I can see how the friend might have felt pressured to say it was OK and it didn't need replaced when she actually felt very different. \n\n\nI'm a bit precious about my books. I hate people dog-earing and breaking spines and have more than once, told someone to keep a book when they tried to return one that I lent them in \"as new\" condition and it looks like it spent the entire time rolled up in their back pocket. I may, in those circumstances, warn my friends not to lend to that person if they are also precious about their books so that we can still remain friends with someone who doesn't feel the same about book condition.", "I am also a lover of books and when you put it that way, it makes sense. That may have been OPs approach when returning the book. She did try to convince us it was still readable so it makes sense she may have done the same with the book lender.", "My mom and I both love reading other ppls margin notes, esp from ppl we know and value the insights of. Many ppl find it irritating and I wouldn't do it to a borrowed book without expressly knowing the owner was cool with it. But yeah ppl have different book preferences and op really didn't know what the friends were without asking"]}
