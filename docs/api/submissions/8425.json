That was the asshole bit.  \n\nCould you have done better, yes.

Like, seriously, it's the only place indoor where you shouldn't bring a book.", "Soft YTA because I've done the exact same thing before, except it was a library book. I had to pay the fee for a new one. If you accidentally damage someone else's property, you either fix it or pay to have it fixed", "NTA. You ruined the book and offered to replace it. She said no. It's not your responsibility from that point on unless she changes her mind. Unlike what a lot of people are saying here, you aren't entitled to replace something that she doesn't want replaced.

Unless there is some nuance you're leaving out, that's pretty clear cut.\n\nI guess she expected you to assume she was lying? You're supposed to know that her \"no\" means \"yes\" in this case? That's ridiculous, and exhausting. If she changed her mind after the conversation, it would have been very easy for her to say \"I thought it over, and I would like you to replace that book.\" My guess is that she doesn't care as much about the book as she does about stirring the pot.\n\nShe sounds like a drama queen. In your shoes, I would do these things:\n\n1. Replace the book, maybe include a note that says \"This is a replacement for the book I accidentally damaged.
