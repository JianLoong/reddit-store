I was really annoyed because I had been looking forward to the chocolate one and I thought it was pretty selfish of him to eat it without even asking me first, or asking which flavor I\u2019d prefer to have. When I told him I was upset and explained why, he got super defensive - he told me I was overreacting, said he\u2019d gotten me a nice array of other desserts to have tonight so it shouldn\u2019t matter, and even asked me if I\u2019d \u201ctaken my pills\u201d today because the last time I got angry over nothing I\u2019d forgotten my medication.
