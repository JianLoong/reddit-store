My nephew is only 1 year old but in 1 month he will be 2. I asked my sister what he would like and and showed her the gift I wanted to gift him. She said it was perfect. So bought the gift it was expensive. So  today she asked me if I bought the present and I said yes. Then she said that I should give my nephew the present now because on his birthday he might be to old and not interested in it anymore. But the present says it is for 1-4 year olds. And I looked through it and there was some stuff in there that I knew my nephew couldn't even do at the moment, so he has some more things he could learn. But I don't have another present for him and I know that I'll look stupid if I'm the only one who doesn't give him a present on his birthday. I also don't want to buy another present because I don't want spend more money on a big present. I said that I wouldn't do it but I could give her a toy from the set know but the other toys from the set I would give him on his birthday. She got really mad and said that the toys would be perfect for now because her son really liked to play with them now.\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1690459780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b077s/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_give_my_nephew_his/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said yourself that if you gave it to him now you'd feel weird being the only person not giving him a gift on his actual birthday. NTA", "NTA. \n\nI don't see what the big deal is, on her end. By your story, it's only a matter of a few short weeks. Plus, the kid really isn't going to know the difference whether you give him the gift now or later. \n\nAlso, it's no one else's business if you DID happen to give the present early/it looks like you didn't bring a gift. You are under no obligation to explain or get another present in that case.", "NTA a month isn\u2019t enough time for a baby to suddenly not be attracted to baby things. \n\nAt that point why give a gift that\u2019s only going to be useful for a month when you can return it and get something else? On top of that you said the age range was 1-4 so it\u2019s meant to be a toy you play with over the years of growing up.\n\nIt\u2019s not about him not being interested it\u2019s about your sister just wanting to give it to him now. Call me old fashions but birthday gifts are meant to only be given on birthdays just like Christmas present are only meant to be given on Christmas. I never got the point of gifting before the occasion (I can understand if it\u2019s for someone not going to be around on that specific day but doing it when they\u2019ll be there is just stupid to me)", "Your sister needs a reality check.\n\nAbsurd entitlement and control issues.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  His birthday is one month away, there is no chance he will outgrow it before then.  I don\u2019t know what your sister\u2019s real reason is for wanting it early, but her demand is silly.", "NTA. I don't know why your sister is so intense about this. Do you expect she may make a show expecting another present on the actual bday? If this is the case, don't give the present. But otherwise I would just give it to keep the peace, you know what happened so don't worry how you'll look at the party.", "NTA If you hadn't told her about the gift she wouldn't of known about it and wouldn't be asking for it\n \nHe won't even understand presents at his age anyway.", "Your sister sounds like she wants to pretend the gift is from her. Don't give it early. Your nephew won't be too old for it - you could give it to him in 6 months time and he would still enjoy it.", "NTA. like what, the gift is perfect now but in 1 month the kid will be to old ? I have 4 kids, one of them is 2, and I swear this is non sense. I assume the kid really likes this kind of toys and she wants him to have some but she doesn't want to spend more money because his birthday is soon. Either you agree to give him now but you don't gift him anything on D day, or you give him on his birthday.", "NTA- save it for his birthday.  If he's not super into it he will cycle around.  Kiddos at that age do. Heck mine still do.\n\nAt the end of the day you can buy the nicest most age appropriate gift and the kiddo will eat the box.\n\nMy partner just bought a office chair and the box that came in is my 9-year-old's favorite toy.\n\nThe chair ended up defective, and it was heartbreaking how much my nine-year-old had developed a loving rapport with this box.\n\nI don't want to assume anything.  But you give the gift now you want to have something for the party and I could see a person forgetting and just buying another gift.\n\nI don't know you know your family I don't.\n\nBut save the present for the birthday.", "NTA, but couldn\u2019t you just say that you gave him his gift early if you\u2019re worried about what people will think?", "NTA, she's being strange. The birthday is only a month away? I don't understand her goal in all of this and why she is being that controlling in the situation. She is basically calling your gift useless 4 weeks from now, so why does she want it anyways? I am sure your nephew will love the gift on his birthday just as much as he would 1 month prior.\n\nAlso it sounds like you put and lot of thought into choosing a good gift for him, and spent a large amount of money. I would be grateful!", "NTA. Sis is trying to get two gifts out of you. One now and one at the b'day. There is no way your nephew is going to outgrow a gift in one month.", "NTA, it almost sounds like she is trying to scam you out of another toy.  This is very strange.", "NTA. Birthdays gifts are for birthdays. I'm not usually a stickler for this sort of thing, but the added pressure would make me one.", "NTA. I wonder if she was planning to regift it? I can\u2019t think of another reason why she didn\u2019t want to wait a month. The kid won\u2019t notice", "NTA and your sister is making no sense. The only logical reason to give him his present early would be if it were clothes that would possibly be too small by his birthday.", "NTA, your sister is getting mad for no reason", "How can a present, that your nephew will be \"too old for\" in ~ a month, be perfect for him?!?!?\nIf I were a mother and someone would show me a present for my kid that I think he will not even use for a month because he will be too old after that I would tell that person and not let them buy it and ask them to gift it right away?", "NTA. Your sister sounds insane. I mean literally. And why do you need to give another thing now, but something else in a month? This all sounds bizarre", "NTA, your sister makes no sense at all. How will he be to old?", "NTA. It's a birthday gift. It can wait until his birthday.", "NTA.", "Just give it now and take a photo of the kid playing with the gift. (In case anybody says anything about why didn\u2019t you get the kid a present)\n\nAnd next time? Give a gift card.

She can like it or lump it, take it down the road and dump it.\n\nWhat is it with all these Reddit relatives thinking they can treat sister or in-law, etc, like a doormat?\n\nYou don't owe her obedience. She doesn't have the right to tell you when to give your present. Who died and made her queen?\n\nDon't deal with her anymore. Return the gift for a refund and skip the party. Enough with these entitled relatives.\n\nNTA, but you probably shouldn't have told her anything about the present in the first place. Never tell a relatives anything till it's already happened, or they'll push in and start fighting.", "Just give him the toys and don\u2019t buy another present.

Maybe if she has actuall reason for it would make sense to give it early\n\nThe present will go to the child anyways and this is the important thing\n\nIt won't make you stupid showing without a present at last on my experience is normal to family members to give them on more private momentes \n\nStill she has no reason to be mad at you", "Here i thought I was being the pessimist thinking she wanted it to sell/maybe fund the party", "NTA\n\nIf a month is enough time for a child to no longer be interested in this type of toy, then buying an expensive toy was a foolish decision.  \n\nIf that isn't the case, then the child who is actually a completely unaware toddler who has no real grasp on the concepts at hand here can absolutely wait a month for a gift he doesn't know exists.", "NTA, birthday presents are for birthdays. I wonder if mom is just stressed out and he's crying a lot as babies do, and she's hoping a toy wil get her a few hours of quiet. either way, not an appropriate request, and leaves it seeming like she could be trying to squeeze a second gift out of you. which eh idk about that but maybe.", "NTA. \n\nWould your sister have the ability financially to buy just as an expensive gift? Maybe she\u2019s just worried what she will give him will pale in comparison. I was a young single mom at one point in my life. My son had constant ear infections and even though through his dad he had military insurance it was a 3-5 day wait to get him an appointment on post. \n\nAt 75 bucks a pop for a regular cash pay appointment back to back to back one year, I was hard enough up to consider selling my ex engagement ring / wedding ring to cover his birthday. He was turning three and I turned to family that year for help. My mom made his cake, my sister sent him a few amazing gifts, and I bought him one gift myself. It was the guilt that I could not provide for him that was eating at me more than the fear he would remember such a small birthday for years. \n\nTalk to her and be kind. If she cannot articulate what the real reason is keep the present for his actual party. From someone who only had one sibling show interest in my children, thank you. Stick with it for your nephews sake, as he gets older he will think back kindly on you remembering his birthday each year. (Not saying that he will remember this one, the two year old won\u2019t but for the future ones.)", "No, no, no, you see, the kid is a super genius and in one month's time will outgrow a toy that is for kids two years older. In two months, he will graduate high school, and in three months, he will have his PHD!", "WTF. NTA. He will outgrow it in a month? She has issues.", "NTA \n\nIts true, your nephew won't remember the toy. He most likely forgot it less than an hour after it was shown to him lol. So it shouldn't be a problem if you wait. Your sister literally made your argument for you. Kids are smart, but within developmental limits. I think people forget that. You could have given him a cardboard box with a happy face on it instead of what you showed him and he wouldn't notice. They'll play with anything visually appealing at that age, which why it's kind of silly to get them expensive things.  You have officially gone above and beyond. No assholery afoot.", "NTA - the BIRTHDAY present is for the birthday. In one month. End of story. Stop letting the kids mother try to bully you.", "NTA. She just wants to force you into buying a second expensive gift. Tell her that if she thinks he would be too old for it by his birthday, then you will return it and buy something else. Or she can buy it from you now at your cost and you will get something else later.", "NTA- Wait the month. It\u2019s not clothes. Perhaps the kid is tired of the toys he has and mom wants something now. Or the \u201cJones\u201d said \u201cJason has this toy and why doesn\u2019t your son have it too?\u201d Or some other stupid reason.
