Here is why I say you are NTA:\n\n1. You are protecting your kids from growing up with insecurities with their eye colour and hair colour. You are also teaching your kids that all eye and hair colours are beautiful and they (the kids) are unique and beautiful in their own ways\n2. Your ex-MIL's use of filter shows she does not appreciate her grandkids for being different and possibly in denial\n3. Your ex-MIL's use of filter is not going to benefit her and what happens if her acquaintances or friends see your kids up close and personal to find not all your kids have blonde hair and blue eyes. If I am your ex-MIL's acquaintance at some local book club or church, I would feel cheated to learn ex-MIL has been using filter on her grandkids' photos on social media if I see your kids in person\n\nYour ex-MIL has issues to be honest", "NTA and ffs, really? Blond and lue eyes are the only thing she wants to see? Sometimes I sit back in shock at how dehumanizing our world is becoming. I am so sorry she is doing this. You aren't \"gate keeping\" your children, you're protecting them from someone that is telling all your kids that only two of them look \"right\". That is so damaging. Kudos to you for reporting her!", "NTA\n\nYour kids are or will very soon be old enough to recognize that they have been altered in those photos and the next ones and next ones. \n\nFilters are a bit iffy, people can get carried away, maybe the kids were part of messing around with the settings and thought it looked funny, hard to say. \n\nBut (bad) photoshop? Waaay over the line. They will know that they are not pretty enough for grandma\u2019s facebook very soon and that\u2019s not something any kid should feel. And they will notice the difference with the \u201cright\u201d siblings.", "NTA. WTAF?

Ex-MIL does not realise what she is doing will give those poor grandkids a complex over their eye and hair colours. It is not right for a child to end up thinking they are not good enough and not loved enough for being different"]}
