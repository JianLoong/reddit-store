Your response then should be \"I need to reserve my time for paying clients\".  If I'm free, I'm willing to help out but my availability will be reduced.", "NTA - im with you, a one off is fine. But babysitting several days a week is too much.", "NTA. Your generosity is being taken for granted. Regardless of whether you need the money or not, she thinks she\u2019s entitled to free childcare, several days a week and weekends. She was aware of your work experience babysitting and saw this as advantageous- until you gave notice of payment for future services.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nMy god, some people have nerve!  She is getting a \"friends and family discount\", but she has so much entitlement by interfering and expecting you to drop your real clients for her \"emergencies.\"  Stop accommodating her, and send her some options for backup sitters.", "NTA. Babysitting is currently your way of earning money. Why should your sister get it for free? That is very entitled of her. I would take paying gigs instead. Let her find her own babysitter and see if she can get one without paying for it.", "All the family members who call you TA for not doing it for free should step up, and do it for free, because family. NTA.", "NTA, just tell her what you told us. you were fine stepping in for the occasional emergency for free, but if you're going to be a regular babysitter, they need to compensate you like one. they're taking advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nI would just refuse to sit for her at all anymore.", "NTA. Those family members who say that you shouldn\u2019t charge? Send cousin-sister their names and tell her they are willing to babysit for free.", "NTA. She asked. You said no. She is wrong to try to insist by putting family pressure on you.", "NTA - I really do hate that whole \"it's family\" line.  If helping family is so important, what are you getting out of this?  Sure, the cousin is getting free babysitting but what are you getting out of it?  Spending time with the niblings....yeah, no.  What is in it for you?", "NTA  If she doesn't want to pay you then she can pay someone else.

That's SOOOOO often that they have free time and are specifically choosing to not spend it with the children they chose to make.", "NTA I'd just start saying \"no, sorry\"", "So, how long does she expect free daycare?  If you were eaten by squirrels tomorrow she'd have to pay someone else.  So she's saving money by standing on your family loyalty and playing the guilt strings like a harp.  If it's once in a while it's a favor.  If it's a regular weekly gig it's exploitation.", "NTA. If family should support one another, what has she been doing to contribute? My guess is nothing because people like her are takers.\n\nI would stop babysitting for her. It's not wrong to be asked to pay for your time. Especially since you were babysitting so often.", "NTA obviously, but I\u2019m confused if this your cousin or sister. The OP says \u201cmy cousin sister.\u201d Is this a cousin that you\u2019re close to like a sister?", "NTA.", "NTA", "Nta you're not free labor", "NTA.  Do the rest of your family perform work for free?  Maybe they'd like to do the babysitting in the future.  Suggest that to them.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe is the one being materialistic and money focused", "NTA your sister is an entitled brat who thinks she can just dump her kids off on you.  Which is complete bullshit.  She's not even grateful.  STOP babysitting altogether.  Time for your sister to parent her own @#$ offspring.", "NTA, tell them when they go to their job and work for free let you know if not then all they care about is money. When they start to work for free so will you.", "NTA.  They can pay up or pay someone else to watch their kids.  Your time is not theirs to take without compensation.", "NTA.\n\nYour \"sister cousin\" and her husband are cheap, yet they think you are in the wrong.  They use you regularly for free childcare, both for work and to have alone time.\n\nHere is what I would tell your entire family:\n\n1.  I have a rate that I charge non-family for babysitting.\n2. I have a family rate, which is discounted 20%.  \n3. I will provide free childcare only in the case of emergencies, such as rushing somebody to the hospital.  Providing back-up daycare while you work is not an emergency. \n\nAsk your freeloading cousin exactly what she does to help YOU out.", "NTA  \n\n\nI assume the rest of the family is not stepping up to help with all this babysitting?", "NTA\n\nGee, she wants me time.

Is this your cousin or your sister?  Doesn't really matter because you owe neither one anything.", "Those family members can step up and babysit.", "NTA. Just say NO. You don't owe your unappreciative, entitled relative free babysitting.", "NTA.  Your free time is just as important as anyone else, including family.  Remind your sister that she has been taking advantage of you for too long.  That you have others that actually pay you for babysitting.  Stand your ground and don't let the family intimidate you.", ">When I informed her that, she had a fit and started accusing me of not caring about family and just being materialistic and money focused.\n\nIt's funny because that's exactly what she's doing. She doesn't care about family because she's exploiting you and she's materialistic and money focused because she thinks she doesn't have to pay you, so you're her first choice. \n\n\nNTA, and this is your hill to die on.", "NTA - One could say she doesn\u2019t care about family , you shouldn\u2019t want to scam /screw over family \u2026 yet here you are baby sitting for free and here she is taking advantage of and trying to manipulate you to keep baby sitting for free", "NTA\n\nHold your ground. She's asking you to do a job.", "NTA, you should be paid.", "At this point OP is subsidizing the life/lifestyle of the cousin and that's not ok.\n\nThe right response to family members who hassle OP on this is \"Glad to hear you think helping cousin is important. What days are you available to babysit? Cousin will be so grateful.\"", "Not to mention that they are asking her to babysit so the father can get some \"alone time\"....  when did that become Op's responsibility to provide for?\n\nIt's called parenting...  I think it's the cousin's sister that is being materialistic for not paying for a service!"]}
