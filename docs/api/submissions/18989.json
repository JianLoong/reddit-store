It caused us to not be well off financially throughout our daughter\u2019s childhood up until recently. \n\nWell, last weekend my ex and her husband decided to take our daughter and their son to Disneyland which is about 4 hours away, for the weekend. Monday morning I facetime with my daughter just wondering how it went she started crying saying the whole time her brother was throwing fits when he didn't get what he wanted, if the lines were taking too long he would throw get upset, and start throwing a fit. She said she felt bad because she knows he can't help it overall but she was upset her trip was ruined.   I understand because, for most of her childhood, neither her mom nor I could afford vacations like that. \n\nI have vacation time built up so I said I would take her and we can do some other things as well. She seemed excited and thanked me several times. Well a few hours later I got a call from my ex getting mad I was going to take her to Disneyland after she just went.

Your daughter deserves better.", "NTA\n\nIt does not sound like your ex is doing a very good job here - perhaps Disney was not an appropriate place to take her son, at least with her approach to parenting. Regardless, she should have thought about what would make a vacation enjoyable for BOTH of her children and planned accordingly. \n\nYour ex is only mad because she knows your daughter will have more fun with you, and that brings up a lot of uncomfortable feelings about her own inadequacies/the reality of life with your daughter's half-brother that she doesn't want to face. Take your daughter, have fun, make memories.", "Nope NTA\n\nPeople who grow up with a disabled sibling like that usually get the short end of the stick. Just because she's neurotypical doesn't mean she doesn't have feelings or needs. Honestly if her brother was incapable of standing in lines, they could have gotten special accommodations. Instead your ex made your daughter and her brother suffer for no reason.\n\nTake her on the trip. It sucks your ex doesn't see the harm she's causing.", "You know you are NTA. Her mom is just exhausted and in a bad mood bc they just got done traveling.  The timing of saying you'll do it was good for your daughter but bad for your ex. Good luck getting her back on board.", "NTA. Your ex knows your daughter didn't enjoy the trip because of her son (because I'd imagine she didn't either). She's upset because she knows from now on in daughter's mind vacation with dad=fun, vacation with mom=not fun, and she might start choosing to do less things with ex if the son will also be there.\n\nUnfortunately for her, that's not your problem. Your job is to raise your daughter, and part of that is making her happy. Your ex can take your daughter on a mother-daughter trip if she's so worried about having fun vacation memories together, but that's out of your control.", "NTA. There was zero wrong with what you did. If your ex feels like an AH, it\u2019s probably because she knew your daughter didn\u2019t have a good time at Disneyland, and she might resent that she quite reasonably determined your daughter had a better time with you. My personal experience dictates it is very common for divorced/split parents to feel competitive about what they can provide to their shared children.", "NTA. You have just as much a right to take your daughter on vacation as she does. As a kid in a family where another child has special needs, you unfortunately have to put aside your own wants and preferences at times and although it is not their fault, it does feel unfair and limiting. You are doing something wonderful by providing your daughter with another opportunity to have a positive experience. \n\nAlthough I am sure your ex wife may also feel pressure and it can be hard to admit that due to her other child she cannot always provide your daughter with the same experiences and opportunities that you can. You are definitely NTA but I would not hold it against your ex that she is struggling with feeling that you get to \u201cone up\u201d her. She likely realizes it was a negative experience for your daughter and might feel bad that you can give her daughter an experience that she was unable to.", "NTA your ex and her husband should\u2019ve done more to take the load off their kid. Disney was likely an inappropriate vacation for him. I\u2019ve got a kid like that and just the thought of attempting such a trip gives me hives.", "NTA \n\nSurely her mom could tell the first time was stressful and not fun for her, I don\u2019t understand why she thinks a redo is a bad idea", "NTA your ex shouldn\u2019t have exclusive rights to bring your daughter to Disney. I can see your ex being disappointed your daughter didn\u2019t enjoy herself the first time but she should have known how it would go.", "NTA, I get it. It isn\u2019t her brothers fault, but your daughter is young too and she won\u2019t be young forever. She deserved a chance to just enjoy herself at Disneyland, if that means not taking her brother then so be it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this, and if anyone says YTA then I don\u2019t understand it. Take your daughter to Disneyland and have fun", "NTA.  The Ex has no say in how often you take your daughter to Disneyland.  Hope you have a great time!", "NTA. You are wise to recognise the sometimes-destructive impact of having a special-needs sibling on other siblings. Taking your daughter is a lovely idea.", "NTA. If you can afford to take your daughter to Disneyland, why not? Even if bro hadn't made daughter's trip difficult, daughter making memories with her dad on vacation is just as important as making memories with mom. You guys can do different things together than daughter did on her first trip. I know families who go to Disneyland as, like, an annual pilgrimage. Many people go to Disneyland more than once.", "NTA - Did anyone ask what he thinks? No? Great. Keep it movin.", "NTA Why does your ex wife care where you take your daughter on vacation? So long as she knows where your daughter is and she can communicate with her, what difference does in make if it's Disneyland or the Grand Canyon? It sounds like she's just trying to cause drama for the sake of drama.", "NTA, take your kid on vacation. Have a blast!", "NTA - so your daughter had an awful time and your ex is upset that you offered to take her back\u2026. I am a parent and I get it is tough but it seems your ex has her priorities off.  Instead of trying to rectify the situation during the trip or figuring something after she is avoiding the issue altogether.", "NTA your ex got her trip with y'all's daughter to Disneyland now it's simply you getting your turn. Nothing more. If she enjoys it more that's nobody's business but your daughter's.\n\nIt's just a fact that Disney parks aren't people friendly even for neurotypical people. It's exhausting to go to their parks even for neurotypicals. Your ex's son and their family including your daughter would have probably been better off at a much smaller amusement park with a lot less people than the crowds at Disneyland.", "NTA.  Go and make a wonderful memory with her.", "NTA: Just want to lol with your ex it\u2019s your money you can take a trip for your daughter if you both want to. \n\nIgnore your ex and enjoy your trip with your daughter.", "NTA.  Your time, your kid, you can do whatever you want within custody agreement.", "100% NTA  take youre daughter for some fun time she deserves and you can tell youre EX to go see a shrink if she dosent see what is wrong with her acctions.", "Definitely NTA. She\u2019s your daughter too and you can take her to Disney if you want. Your ex is being a jerk", "NTA. Your daughter is *your* daughter. The boy is not your child. Tell them you want to take *your* child only, and make sure she has a good time. Kudos to her for being understanding and sympathetic.", "NTA it\u2019s none of your ex business where you take your daughter for vacation. It\u2019s great that you are redoing the trip. If your ex keeps this up it won\u2019t be long before your daughter come to live with you.\n\nYour ex needs to realize even though she has a child with a disability it\u2019s ok for the daughter to get to have a normal vacation that\u2019s all about her.", "NTA\n\nYou can let your ex know about Disney's program for people like her son.   Disability Access Service (DAS) \n\nhttps://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/disability-access-service/\n\nHave fun at Disney!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is great. And maybe offer for her to live with you 100% if she wants. She is at an age where the courts will take HER decission into account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is ok for her to not want all of her life ruined by her liitle brother's special needs.", "NTA, but when things have cooled down you might want to send your ex info about DAS at Disneyland for next time. You can Google for details, but it's basically a service for folks like your ex's son who have a disability that makes waiting in line difficult.", "NTA. Take her wherever you want on your time with her (obviously not like a bar/strip club!). \n\nBut, see if your ex knows about the Disability Access System at the Disney Parks. They can set it up where the family won\u2019t have to actually stand in a long line where the boy can\u2019t handle it, but get a return time to ride without the wait. Then, during that time, they can browse shops, check out shows/parades or sit and rest, basically just not stick a spectrum kid in a situation he is not equipped to deal with. Ex can call ahead to the Guest Services or check in at Town Hall upon arrival, although it\u2019s better to set it up ahead of time. It will make the next trip less stressful for the whole party and those around him.", "NTA. Her brother ruined the experience for her. She deserves to go without him and enjoy herself.", "NTA but you need to reframe this as, \"I realized how special of trip Disney is for kids and at 15. She's not going to be my little girl for much longer. So I asked if I could piggyback on a Disney trip so we could have that special time together too.\"", "Mom is scared of losing her babysitter and/or child support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am sure the brother takes a lot of care an attention.  So my guess is mom is worried daughter is going to do what is best for her and move in with dad where she has more attention.
