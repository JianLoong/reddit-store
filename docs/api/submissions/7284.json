I'm guessing that's to coordinate between you, your husband, and your 4 bio kids. Your husband does do chores, I hope?\n\nThe part that makes me think your husband is an AH is where he said she's too busy with school and work. If she was living on campus or in an apartment, she would have household chores to do. She shouldn't get a free pass just because you're available to do her share of the chores. But he could earn her a reprieve if he'll step up and do her share. He's only truly an AH if he's trying to put her share on your shoulders.\n\nKatie is an AH for saying she doesn't have to do chores. Back to the \"if she lived on campus or in an apartment\" if she had a room or apartment to herself, she would be doing all the chores. More realistically, she would have one or more roommates, and everyone would need to do their share.\n\nWhere I see you being an AH is in dictating who does what and on which days. Her school and work schedules presumably vary from day to day, and she should have a say re: which days she is most able to schedule time for doing chores vs. which ones are just too busy. Your husband isn't completely wrong about her needing to fulfill her other responsibilities. And, in a roommate situation, people typically collaborate and compromise on dividing up household tasks, so they feel like they have some ownership in the tasks they have committed to doing.\n\nLastly, please make sure that the chores you ask her to do make sense, like washing, folding, and putting away her own laundry. She would do that if she lived on her own. Doing someone else's laundry? That seems unreasonable to me. She wouldn't do that in a dorm.", "NTA.", "NTA yeah she may be an \u201cadult\u201d but those who have to say they\u2019re an adult don\u2019t fit the category. Pay rent or do chores.

The fact that she thinks she should be paid, when she's living rent-free and is being supported so that she can make going to school her full-time job, does mean that she should have a side gig stepping up as an adult in the house.

She's an adult she needs to learn to act like it", "So Katie is an adult, hmm?\n\nWell, adults pay rent so start charging her.\nAnd since she has what amounts to her own apartment in somebody else's house, she shouldn't be spending most of her time in the common areas where she contributes to the mess.\n\nBoth Katie and your husband need to step up the contributions to the upkeep of the home.

She'll soon come to miss that sweet deal she had.", "Either you do chores because you're part of the home or you pay rent because you're renting the basement.  She's an adult.  Give her those options and ask her which sounds better.\n\nNTA", "NTA: If she was a roommate she'd have to contribute work to the household.

Although she is legally an adult, at 19 she is still a teenager, with a teenage mind. The mind keeps developing until approximately 25 y/o. \n\nDon't call it chores, but call it preparation to life. Don't give her a set chore, but let her help you coordinate the others chores so she can be prepared for when she moves out and has to run her own household", "NTA.\n\nUsual agreements in my country, with parents that can economically help their children, is either chores either rent. That is also correct in my opinion.", "NTA. That is a reasonable expectation in my mind.\n\nI argued against chores once I became an adult, but it was because I was required to at least weekly vacuum the house, clean all the bathrooms, and wipe down the kitchen while my younger brother was required to do no chores whatsoever.", "NTA- I pay rent and do chores while I\u2019m going to school because I\u2019m grateful that my parents are still feeding me and providing shelter", "NTA\n\nShe can either pay rent or pull her share\n\nShe sounds like shes been spoiled if she doesn't expect to be treated like an adult in the real world\n\nShes immature", "NTA -\n\nShe uses your bathroom, eats your food, uses your water, enjoys your heat, needs your electricity - uhhhh yeah - she can do some flippin' chores.", "NTA.

No matter how busy my life can be I'm doing chores, I'm almost thirty and mum still scares me... Don't even live there anymore", "No you\u2019re not the asshole.

Good adult roommates pay rent, clean their spaces AND do chores to keep the common areas clean. \n\nKatie still spends time and and uses the main areas of the home, including the kitchen. \n\nIt\u2019s is not unreasonable to expect children (minor and adult) to contribute to keeping the common areas of the home clean.

And do chores.", "She cooks in 'their' kitchen when she has a 'kitchen' in her apartment? And still doesn't want to do chores? \n\nGuess who just lost kitchen privileges?", "One of our adult children lives with us, minimal chores asked,no rent.  When he stops doing his chores every so often I calculate the average cost of a one bedroom apartment divided by the estimated time spent doing his chores.  I tell him this is what we are paying him to take out the garbage and cut the lawn.  He can stop doing his chores and pay me to do it or move out.  Usually stops the complaining for a bit.", "Depends, is he just giving the money for the food or is he making the list, going to the store, etc. \n\nBecause being in charge of planning and buying food for this large of a household is definitely a chore.", "Compromising is fine, but you don\u2019t want OP to take it so far that her daughter her an unrealistic idea of what it means to be an adult or to contribute to a household. \n\nOP is asking for a pretty minimal contribution, I think it would be better to sit the daughter down and have a real talk with her about the cost of living and the time it takes to care for a home. Explain all the tasks that go into cleaning the kitchen, buying the food, etc.", "Right?!? When I lived at home as an adult, I was expected to keep my area clean, help maintain the common areas of the house, and cook dinner once a week. No idea why an adult child would expect to do less and not more while living at home rent free.", "Definitely NTA. I feel for her because she wants to believe she\u2019s made it into adulthood, but I work with college students and realistically they don\u2019t transition until 22ish. The reality is she\u2019s still living at home since she\u2019s using shared spaces and benefiting from family resources, but just has increased privacy and autonomy. Maybe you could add on a more adult-only level task like doing tax returns to make her feel incorporated into the adults club. ;)", "Exactly what I meant. I do want to give the daughter some benefit of the doubt I understand when your new to college and work things get overwhelming quickly and it\u2019s hard to adapt. \nI do think they just need a talk and find a balance. \n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly normal of her to want to only take care of herself without doing chores it\u2019s just not realistic .In a house with lots of people it probably gets overwhelming \nSome people are being overly critical of someone who\u2019s just a new adult.", "NTA\n\nShe isn\u2019t paying for her electricity, her water for her laundry or any bills. So, she needs to help out somewhere in a way that it helps you all out. \n\nThose chores are negligible.", "NTA I\u2019d explain to her that chores are a part of adulting. By her reasoning you should never do a damn thing. So she is still a part of the household, lives there, using utilities and most likely eating some household food. Lives in her own space away from the chaos for free. Does she think the fairies and brownies are going to clean her home when she moves out? She may think she\u2019s an adult but obviously not. She needs to help out and she is being paid with a free roof over her head.", "NTA.  She's an adult.  She's living under your roof.  You do not have to allow her to stay with you.  You do not have to allow her to stay rent free.  You did not have to give her her own area.  The least she can do is pick up after herself and do a few chores.  If the chores aren't doable because of her work schedule, that would be something.

She lives under your roof and has her own personal spaces, basically a private apartment.  She needs to contribute in some way.  You're not asking her to pay rent.

Either pay rent and stick to your rented space, or be a member of the family and do your chores.", "I don't know about that, a lot of people in this subreddit made it a mission in life never to do one and a surprisingly large amount are getting away with it (not avoiding chores)\n\nNta", "FREE RENT, there's your compromise.", "Her laundry is mixed in with everyone else\u2019s.", "If she\u2019s cleaning/maintaining what is basically the basement apartment and paying rent for it, it would be unreasonable to expect her to do chores outside her living space.

It is part of her living space.  She doesn\u2019t have her own laundry facilities either.  Even if she was paying rent for the living space, she would still be using OP\u2019s facilities to do laundry, would still be walking in thru her entryway.  OP\u2019s expectations are reasonable.\n\nGenuinely unsure why this is a controversial opinion.", "Doing the grocery shopping isn\u2019t a household chore? I think most people would disagree.", "NTA. Do you and your husband nor get to do chores because you're adults? Of course not.

She is using utilities after all and you went to a lot of trouble to make a nice living space for her.", "NTA. I lived with my parents for a few years and still did chores and paid rent. It\u2019s not unreasonable", "She can do something to help. Even the smallest thing like take out the trash is a help. If she can\u2019t do that maybe she needs a dose of reality in the real world.  If she was paying rent or even a utility and keeping her area clean then yes your being harsh but in this case your justified.", "NTA. If she wants to live there rent free, bill free, she needs to do something. Or else she can move and pay rent and bills and see how expensive 'adult ' life really is.

I\u2019m guessing EVERYONE shares a room EXCEPT oldest. For the low low price of one basket of laundry a day, she gets a fucking efficiency apartment for free.

And then the pandemic taught me about delivery, so I don\u2019t even leave the house.
