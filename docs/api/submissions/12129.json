Which I understand you are being very vague about on the internet, (seems the one time you are concerned). It sounds like she went through a severely traumatic event to be behaving the way she is. You are not being supportive, you are being dismissive and selfish. You are supposed to be a new parental support for her (even if just minimally), and you are failing miserably! If you didn't want to take up any parental responsibility, you should not marry somebody with a child! And it seems you already knew that this child had trauma!

Did he never even ask to meet the kid?", "Or the mother could of been straight up about her child's issues. It seems she skirted around the issue when brought up and just dumped it on OP, basically forcing him to accept it. Not saying what he did is right, but what the wife did was wrong also.", "He replied in one comment that he was lied to and wasn't aware of her daughter's situation. So he is the nta but his wife is. She is not ready to get her daughter medical help. She is an asshole.", "The mom intentionally kept him in the dark.", "Sorry not commenting to sound rude or anything, but the child doesn\u2019t have special needs, op has stated she has a massive amount of trauma and from what I\u2019ve seen this can present like op is describing.\n\nOp was lied to from the start, he was told the child was receiving help and getting better, whilst being kept from her whilst she was at her worst. I\u2019m going with ESH as the wife should be doing more medically for her child to help her through this and op shouldn\u2019t be so judgemental.", "I don't think I read anywhere that he's a mental health professional. Him \"putting effort into being a family\" won't do jack for the poor girl that has PTSD from her mother's past relationship, especially when she's not getting the proper help she needs from her mother's neglect, yes, neglect. What do you want him to do?", "Or the wife could of been honest with OP from the beginning so that he could make an informed choice about the situation rather than lying to him and expecting him to deal with it", "Why should he step up to the plate if the mom isn\u2019t actually doing anything to help the daughter. She obviously needs professional help. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that either.", "Health insurance is my first guess, if it\u2019s genuinely being used for something. \n\nIt could also be fear that the relationship wouldn\u2019t work out if she was honest without a deeper ulterior motive", "And your wife didn't mention any of this before yall got married and moved in together?", "EVERY ADULT IS THE ASSHOLE HERE!\n\nSo then you moved in with a child that you had literally never lived with before! Decided to marry, THEN move in with someone that you didn't even know the regular routine of. \n\nAm I the only one getting very religious vibes off of this? Like, why are you marrying before living together and learning all of this stuff about the child? I would never ever move someone into my house, let alone marry someone, who hadn't met my children and didn't understand their issues! You  absolutely rushed into marrying this person for whatever fucking reason. I do not understand why people are moving in together and not living together first. You should have had experience with this child before you were ever engaged. Both you and the mom are serious assholes.", "that\u2019s a shitty ad hominem attack with absolutely no basis in reality, and i would appreciate either an apology or an edit.\n\nyou have no knowledge of my marital status, our financial status, or any other relevant details, and your last sentence is so far beyond the pale that i wish i was British.", "He knew about the PTSD. What did he think PTSD looked like?", "You think? How did they both miss this giant incongruity in their compatibility?  Since OP the one asking, OP gets the YTA.  You don\u2019t blindly fumble into a marriage to someone with a child.", "Things may have gotten worse for daughter since the wedding though; that was a big change for an 8 year old to cope with and quite conceivably have triggered a significant setback.  \n\nOn the other hand, you'd have thought OP would have gotten to know his stepdaughter before getting married.  And his wife should have facilitated this too.\n\nBoth adults are AHs here, but I can't call a vulnerable 8 year old child an AH.", "Plus mom hid how bad the issues really are. Mom should have been completely honest."]}
