Today, my husband and I (41M and F) took our young son to a kids performance at a local theatre. I booked us three seats on the end of a row. I tend to get quite anxious in crowds, so I prefer to sit on the end where I am not blocked in by strangers. About five minutes before the show started, a family of five (two parents, two young boys around 4-6 and a baby in arms) arrived. Turns out, they had booked last minute and did not have seats together. They sat the two boys in the empty seats directly in front of me, and had booked a spare seat in our row (beside my husband). Their remaining seat was right at the back of the theatre. The mother approached me and asked the three of us to move one seat down, so the father could sit directly behind their two kids, and she would sit at the back with the youngest on her lap. I said \u201cNo, sorry, I prefer not to do that. I booked these seats for a reason and would like to stay here.\u201d She was not happy with this. Finally, after a lot of muttering, the dad sat in his booked seat, and she stomped off to the back, snapping \u201cI hope this comes back to you.\u201d I just told her she was the rude one, and sat back down to enjoy the show. The father and boys ended up moving to some vacant seats further back anyway, and she gave me a filthy look when we crossed paths in the auditorium after the show. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. Sure, it would have been nice, but that was the seat I booked for a reason.

When it comes to things with tickets the onus is on the family that wants to sit together to actually reserve tickets together, and not on others to accommodate.", "NTA, that's the whole point of being able to book seats like that. You...get your seats. They knew what they were getting into", "NTA.

A lot of time, others will accommodate, and that's just a nice thing to do for our fellow human beings.\n\nYou aren't an asshole for saying no though, and they reacted incredibly poorly.

Yea yea bla bla usual refrain from this sub of \"their poor planning doesn't constitute an emergency on your part\" was the expected refrain from all the self involved, obviously perfect individuals that frequent here, but unless you have some kind of mental illness that does not allow you to deal with sitting anywhere but the aisle, refusing to move down a seat because one time you wouldn't have been on the end for a couple hours does make you an asshole IMO.", "NTA", "This is kind of the thing where you rightly owe someone nothing and still are kinda ehhhhhh.\n\nWhy did the two of you not swap with the kids for their end of row seats so they could have sat next to an adult?

Failure on their part to plan ahead doesn't mean they can inconvenience me.", "Exactly! It sounds like there were other open seats, but maybe just not as close as the other family wanted.
