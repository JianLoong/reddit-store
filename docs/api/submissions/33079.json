I'm going to go with a very tiny YTA.

Sounds like you guys don\u2019t really have problems either if this small comment triggered such an overstatement. What you said doesn\u2019t even resemble unhappiness, just standard aging stuff? I think everyone has the habit of looking at another\u2019s life (especially younger ppl/siblings lol) and think \u201coh I wish I did that more\u201d. I don\u2019t see much wrong with it as long as you don\u2019t let it turn into depression (cuz if it does, therapy should be on the table but you didn\u2019t seem to present it like that anyway). \n\nI won\u2019t be giving u advice on how to feel regarding not living ur youth enough. It\u2019s pretty normal. But yeah, what you said really is not a big deal. Everyone should chill. Maybe ask your husband if there is anything on his mind too? Maybe he has his own fears or insecurities and that is why. \nOtherwise congratulations on your baby and family!", "NTA. No one is completely happy with every aspect of their life 100% of the time. It's totally normal to miss parts of your pre-mom life; it's a huge shift in your identity and how carefree you can be. Missing some of that freedom sometimes doesn't diminish the love you have for your husband and child. It sounds like he's just feeling a bit insecure and that doesn't make you TA but as his partner you should validate his feelings. Talk to him about what you meant; that you miss the thought of being able to clock off responsibilities for the night but that that doesn't for a second mean you'd change your life or actually want anything different.\n\nOr, if you can't say that in full honesty, maybe consider some therapy to work out what it is you do actually want.", "Ytah The fact that you referred to him as an occasional regret is not something he will EVER forget. You can\u2019t possibly be this stupid. Just because you think it doesn\u2019t mean you should say it. A lot of people think the grass is greener on the other side but I can guarantee that if your husband packed up and took the baby you\u2019d be devastated.

If it's have fun, you can have fun with your husband. We go kayaking, camping and traveling together. We play cards and games. You need to go out without the baby. If you want to date, well, that's a whole other problem you need to figure out. Do you want to lose your family, have another woman take your place while you date? You need to TALK to your husband. He deserves to know. Good luck", "NTA. Everyone feels this way at times, and it's healthy to actually say it out loud. Your husband needs to understand that. \n\nAlso A+ for \"gaggle\" of friends", "NTA - you made an offhanded comment about wishing you could go out and have more fun.

It\u2019s okay to be envious of someone within reason.  It sounds like you and husband needs to have a talk.  Not super serious but a level set.  He may be feeling like satisfy you or provide you your needs.", "YTA. if i was your husband id have not said anything and would have just started prepping for when you find a new \"friend\" who connects you with all the adventure you seek. its a tale as old as time and while i know you think you're so different from that because you consider it all hyopethetical because of circumstance, your convictions would most likely would change as soon as the circumstances did. He would be stupid to ignore that sign.", "The grass is greener where you water it. If you put effort into a happy and fulfilling marriage, that's what you'll have. If you put effort into pining for the \"fReEdOm to date around,\" that's what you'll eventually have. \n\nPersonally, having had the long dating and hookup life before marriage, I think being happily married and wishing for the dating scene is like living in a palace and thinking how \"fun\" it would be to live in your car. The problem is that it's super easy to go from married to single, but not very easy to go back. In fact, there's no guarantee you ever will. I promise, that realization hits harder than anything you can imagine. \n\nAlso, answering \"do you have one foot out the door?\" with, \"I have regrets,\" is not very reassuring, even if you told him you plan to stay with him and that the regrets are only occasional. \n\n\nNAH. You're allowed to have regrets, but freaking out your partner then offering tepid reassurance is not going to make them feel any more secure.", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to have feelings.

I mean, maybe she does and maybe she is, but that isn't how I personally read it. I think it's very normal to feel temporarily wistful for a different kind of life as you get older. It doesn't mean you're going to get up and actually PURSUE that kind of life, or that you hate your current life.", "So the latter then lol", "This is a tad concerning. I'd hope once you found someone, they'd override the feelings of wanting to date around. Then again, you've never dated and learned how stressful and tedious it is.

NTA,", "There's a happy medium between \"mom with no friends who never goes out\" and \"single woman who parties every weekend\", is all I'm saying.\n\nIt's normal and healthy to have friends outside of your marriage who you hang out with occasionally. You don't have to aim for your sister's life to still have a good time with friends.\n\nAs for making friends, it's always hard as an adult. I'd recommend looking into some local groups of people with similar interests and hobbies as you!

It's not a competition, but I feel you see that sometimes the grass is greener on the other side. All of us feel that, about very random situations. But the main thing is to not hurt someone.

It never hurts to reassure him of your commitment to your life together. \n\nBut remember, not everyone is purely happy living one way. He may be totally content right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be. Feeling stir crazy after having a baby is far from unusual and you should work to get to the bottom of these feelings. What can you do to relieve it? More date nights? More alone time? Maybe find a group thing to attend regularly. It\u2019s really never too late to make friends. Hell, you could bring your baby to a parents meet up or activity if you\u2019re concerned about childcare. And just because you\u2019re a mother doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do fun things. My mother is nearly 50 and still loves to go out dancing, and my father supports her in that because he has his own hobbies and friends. \n\nThe worst thing to do is to shove it down and pretend. It will fester and turn into resentment and that\u2019s not good for anyone in this equation.

But the grass is not greener elsewhere usually. If you leave to explore, you\u2019ll also face regrets for having thrown away other things you love and stability. Be smart.

The point is, you would never give up the security of your life, your sweet baby or your husband, would you? If you think you need to spice up your life, you and your husband should figure out something to add to your marriage and family. For instance, you could play games together or have a night out for dinner on a certain night each week (and take the baby if there is no one to watch the baby). I imagine your sister is sometimes jealous of what you have, too.

I wonder how much your husband overheard. \"God I'm jealous of you sometimes,\" seems understandable and relatable. Are you sure you didn't say anything more damning he might have heard as well?\n\nThat being said, I do think you need to communicate better with your husband.

This does not necessarily mean that you want to blow up your current life, or that you want to spend every weekend in the club! But a few tweaks would probably be good for your mental health. Plan a date night with your husband. Prioritize fun activities you can do as a family (that are not sitting at home while he plays video games and gardens). Look for Mommy-and-Me type classes and activities and actively try to make friends who have little ones around the same age. Ask your husband to give you a break sometimes so you can have some R&R, either to go out and do something you enjoy, or for him to take your little one out of the house so you can just veg. \n\nGive him something to do so he understands that he can be part of the solution here.

Apologize to husband and ask him (if you are prepared for the answer) if he feels like you are truly that unhappy, then follow that with asking him how you can better show up for your marriage to him (if that's something you are interested in preserving).\n2. Start a gratitude journal or some daily habit of gratitude to help you bear witness to how lovely your life is.\n3. Find a new therapist. It sounds like your therapist lets you vent, but it doesn't sound like they have given you many tools to manage or much realistic reflection of your thoughts, feelings, and actions.

It sounds like it would be a heft (it would be for me), but it sounds like it could be worth it. Getting to know other moms, you\u2019ll probably meet other women who feel the same as you and will be willing to try social things with an eye towards your schedule and maternal concerns like maybe preparatory pumping before a night out, or gathering partners to group babysit so you guys can go out dancing.", "Contact your midwife/health unit/library/church and see if they have any mom&baby social groups.
