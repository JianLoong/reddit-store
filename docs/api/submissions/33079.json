You\u2019re still a couple and transforming into a full time \u201cmom and dad\u201d unit kills a lot of romantic relationships. Find a babysitter, take your guy and go watch a movie.

I'd now be constantly worried that you were thinking about leaving. It would stress me the fuck out. Good luck fixing this situation.

I'm so jealous! or \"You got tickets to that sold out show?! I'm so jealous!), but the fact that there seems to be REAL feelings behind you saying it means that it's likely your husband has been noticing your increasing dissatisfaction with your life and, deep inside, he fears that you WOULD rather have a \"freer\" life like your sister. \n\nYour feelings and his fears because he's been picking up hints of your feelings really need to be discussed and worked through. \n\nIf you're dissatisfied with any part of your life, look for ways within the bounds of your marriage and family to make changes. Like, you want more of a social life, so look for people with similar hobbies or interests to hang out with (like reading? join or start a book club - talking with your local library would be a good place to start; like nature and hiking? look for local groups to do those things with, or ask your husband to go with you; like baking/decorating? take a class; basically take things you already enjoy and find ways to add more social activities using them).\n\nSoooo... I'm going to go with a very tiny YTA. There are real feelings behind you saying what you did and your husband seems to have some real fears because he's picked up on those feelings that caused him to get triggered by you saying it.

Sounds like you guys don\u2019t really have problems either if this small comment triggered such an overstatement. What you said doesn\u2019t even resemble unhappiness, just standard aging stuff? I think everyone has the habit of looking at another\u2019s life (especially younger ppl/siblings lol) and think \u201coh I wish I did that more\u201d. I don\u2019t see much wrong with it as long as you don\u2019t let it turn into depression (cuz if it does, therapy should be on the table but you didn\u2019t seem to present it like that anyway). \n\nI won\u2019t be giving u advice on how to feel regarding not living ur youth enough. It\u2019s pretty normal. But yeah, what you said really is not a big deal. Everyone should chill. Maybe ask your husband if there is anything on his mind too? Maybe he has his own fears or insecurities and that is why. \nOtherwise congratulations on your baby and family!", "NTA. No one is completely happy with every aspect of their life 100% of the time. It's totally normal to miss parts of your pre-mom life; it's a huge shift in your identity and how carefree you can be. Missing some of that freedom sometimes doesn't diminish the love you have for your husband and child. It sounds like he's just feeling a bit insecure and that doesn't make you TA but as his partner you should validate his feelings. Talk to him about what you meant; that you miss the thought of being able to clock off responsibilities for the night but that that doesn't for a second mean you'd change your life or actually want anything different.\n\nOr, if you can't say that in full honesty, maybe consider some therapy to work out what it is you do actually want.", "Ytah The fact that you referred to him as an occasional regret is not something he will EVER forget. You can\u2019t possibly be this stupid. Just because you think it doesn\u2019t mean you should say it. A lot of people think the grass is greener on the other side but I can guarantee that if your husband packed up and took the baby you\u2019d be devastated. But keep up this poor behavior and you\u2019ll get that single life your craving.", "You said that so he would hear, and didn't make him feel better. Do you want to date or have fun? If it's have fun, you can have fun with your husband. We go kayaking, camping and traveling together. We play cards and games. You need to go out without the baby. If you want to date, well, that's a whole other problem you need to figure out. Do you want to lose your family, have another woman take your place while you date? You need to TALK to your husband. He deserves to know. Good luck", "NTA. Everyone feels this way at times, and it's healthy to actually say it out loud. Your husband needs to understand that. \n\nAlso A+ for \"gaggle\" of friends", "NTA - you made an offhanded comment about wishing you could go out and have more fun.  Thats not quite the same as actually being jealous of your sisters life and hating your own.  \n\n\nhusband sounds like a brat.", "NTA, he shouln't have listened either. And if he heard anyway, he should just ask what's wrong and how it could be resolved instead of him focusing on his hurt ego...\nEspecialy after having a child, it's normal to have FOMO", "NTA\u2026 everything is not about everyone. Get over yourself dude.", "Nah, you're allowed to feel how you feel. I do see why he's hurt, and maybe he needs a little reassurance of your relationship, but you're allowed to feel whatever you want to feel.", "NTA.  It\u2019s okay to be envious of someone within reason.  It sounds like you and husband needs to have a talk.  Not super serious but a level set.  He may be feeling like satisfy you or provide you your needs.", "YTA. if i was your husband id have not said anything and would have just started prepping for when you find a new \"friend\" who connects you with all the adventure you seek. its a tale as old as time and while i know you think you're so different from that because you consider it all hyopethetical because of circumstance, your convictions would most likely would change as soon as the circumstances did. He would be stupid to ignore that sign.", "The grass is greener where you water it. If you put effort into a happy and fulfilling marriage, that's what you'll have. If you put effort into pining for the \"fReEdOm to date around,\" that's what you'll eventually have. \n\nPersonally, having had the long dating and hookup life before marriage, I think being happily married and wishing for the dating scene is like living in a palace and thinking how \"fun\" it would be to live in your car. The problem is that it's super easy to go from married to single, but not very easy to go back. In fact, there's no guarantee you ever will. I promise, that realization hits harder than anything you can imagine. \n\nAlso, answering \"do you have one foot out the door?\" with, \"I have regrets,\" is not very reassuring, even if you told him you plan to stay with him and that the regrets are only occasional. \n\n\nNAH. You're allowed to have regrets, but freaking out your partner then offering tepid reassurance is not going to make them feel any more secure.", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to have feelings. It\u2019s also ok to be bored with a boring life. Maybe spend a Saturday night out with your sister and her friends?", "NTA. You and your sister sound a lot like my sister and me. I (33f) have one year old twins, work full time and live in the suburbs with my husband and children. My sister (26) lives with her boyfriend in a big city and is often taking trips, going out, etc. I\u2019ve always been introverted and also didn\u2019t date much before I met my husband. This life does not bother me in the slightest and I am content. Still, sometimes I look back and wonder what I could have done differently. And sometimes I hear something exciting my sister has done and feel a little jealous. Which I think is a normal human emotion. And it never lasts. It\u2019s always momentarily, then life goes on.", "The grass is always greener and you have FOMO. \n\n\u201cPartying\u201d is so lame. Drinking a ton for no reason, being in packed bars clubs etc spending lots of money. I\u2019ll never understand it. \n\nYTA for making your husband feel like you\u2019re not happy in your life with him.", "More the former. I do, privately, imagine what it would be like to date since that is something I haven't really experienced.", "Friend making has never been easy for me, unfortunately. It's not really realistic for me to aim for my sister's life, especially now that I have a child.", "So lie to him?", "underrated comment!", "I do see a therapist and have for years.", "We do have occasional date nights (a lot less common now that there's baby but we do still have them).", "Yeah I agree with you and I'm surprised by how many people here seem to think OP must hate her life or be ready to leave her child and husband. I mean, maybe she does and maybe she is, but that isn't how I personally read it. I think it's very normal to feel temporarily wistful for a different kind of life as you get older. It doesn't mean you're going to get up and actually PURSUE that kind of life, or that you hate your current life.", "So the latter then lol", "This is a tad concerning. I'd hope once you found someone, they'd override the feelings of wanting to date around. Then again, you've never dated and learned how stressful and tedious it is. It's not fun and exciting like the movies. Perhaps you and your husband pretend to have never met and go on some hot dates together?", "You should tell your husband that at least", "Wait you want to date around. Why the hell are you married? You are one free weekend away from cheating on your husband.", "YTA. you have it good and hurt your husband for no reason", "You should let your poor husband go. Let him find somebody that actually loves him and wants to build a life with him\nYTA", "It\u2019s okay to feel how you feel. NTA,", "There's a happy medium between \"mom with no friends who never goes out\" and \"single woman who parties every weekend\", is all I'm saying.\n\nIt's normal and healthy to have friends outside of your marriage who you hang out with occasionally. You don't have to aim for your sister's life to still have a good time with friends.\n\nAs for making friends, it's always hard as an adult. I'd recommend looking into some local groups of people with similar interests and hobbies as you! There's likely a local subreddit for your area, I know mine often does small reddit meetups at a bar or restaurant, and they're a lot of fun!", "I'm sure that once your child has grown into an adult or even teens where they can take care of themselves for a couple hours, you can go out and have fun and live a social life!  \n\n\nIt might take quite a few years to get to that point, but in the meantime, maybe try and get into video games with your husband? Me and my soon to be wife love to play video games together and we always grow a special bond playing together! Online video games, 2-player games, and much more!", "i find that a lot of new moms find common ground with other new moms. Are you in the US or Canada? Perhaps you can use one of the apps to connect new moms and pregnant women. Meeting people in the same stage of life can give you the social life you need and want.", "Wow you\u2019re a super mom \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And you're still jealous of a 25 year old young adult who has no children or family responsibilities? Worrying", "Time to get an actual therapist.", "For me it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t seem like a one-off thing she said in the moment, but an actual, real feeling she has and has been having for the past year. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to see a single friend living it up and having a bit of \u201cdamn in jealous, that looks fun\u201d vs experiencing pervasive jealousy and regret. OP seems like the latter to me, even in the way she talks about her boring life and about her husband and baby.", "I definitely know that dating around is not as glamorous as it seems, my sister has definitely told me some horror stories. I think married life just gets dull from time to time and it's easy to imagine what if.", "Nah, some things you should take to your grave. Tell your therapist, diary, reddit, don\u2019t blow up your life.", "As an aside: any games you would recommend? My partner is a huge gamer and I\u2019d love to play more with him, but the problem is that I don\u2019t like very many games and the ones I do like are solo. I\u2019ve tried finding some two player games but the selection is a bit overwhelming!", "We live in an area where socializing is tricky. It's very hard to find like minded people around here", "So? When comparing myself to others, I do say quite often \u201cUGH! Wish I learnt to play an instrument now too!\u201d Or even get jealous of other people\u2019s social lives since lately I have been very busy with my job, family and boyfriend. \nHowever I am not miserable, far from it. I appreciate my life and sure, I wish I had done some things differently. \n\nBut is that not part of life? She did not say it as if it has been eating her up inside terribly, I think she just meant to provide some context.

Don\u2019t get me started :))) my mom felt all sorts of feelings after having me, because it makes you realise your life is changed, no going back. I think it is okay for OP to have these thoughts and not uncommon AT ALL, rather she is actually more honest about it than most people in her situation.", "Sure that's understandable. At the same time it's important to not dismiss your husband's worries. Even if you know it wasn't a serious remark, it doesn't hurt to let him know you love him and his life.", "How would you feel if you found out that your husband felt like this? Bored and unsatisfied? How would you feel if he was there dreaming about dating? I feel so bad for him, this will be a huge blow to his self esteem. This could breed resentment into your marriage. Get some counselling, or you may find yourself on the dating scene", "I\u2019ve been married to my husband for 4 years never once have I thought about what it would be like to date someone else because I simply cannot imagine being with anyone but him.", "It Takes Two is GREAT! My bf is a HUGE gamer and we were able to match skills pretty well in this game it's all about communicating to each other. \n\nAlso you should check out, \"Girlfriend Reviews,\" on YouTube, they do loads of co-op reviews and you'll probably find one that suits your game playing wants and his!", "Awww well what solo games do you enjoy playing? Just so I can get an understanding of what types of games you like :)  \n\n\nAnd, me and my partner currently play a farming/simulation type game together which she's very into and I've been having really fun too :) Maybe you'll like it too! And hopefully your partner! It's a very cozy, relaxing, type of game. There's many different cozy games! We're playing Faefarm right now but there's more like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Sunhaven.  \n\n\nWe also play MMORPGs together which are online and one very good MMORPG to play with a partner is Guild Wars 2 (#1) then Final Fantasy 14!", "Stardew Valley is a simple game that is easy to play.
