Over time over-showering can lead to dry and itchy skin, as well as a higher likelihood of skin infections and allergic reactions.", "Thanks for clarification.

The frequency they shower and the fact they have a little dog that sleeps in the bed, and that OPs partner deems his behaviour \"excessive\". \n\nWhat about the discussion they had? The reasons OP considers the bed \"not clean\"? Would somebody who's taking a shower every night not be concerned about the hairs and overall dust and slobber a dog brings into the bed? Maybe not if they absolutely loved them, I guess... but why change the sheets weekly, then? And why wouldn't the \"less often showering/less concerned with cleanliness\" partner be against it, more so if the partner isn't affected by the work that brings? Is it the money? Then why not say so?\n\nI'm fairly certain this is all about the dog in the bed, and while OP may love the dog, they are not that comfortable with it sleeping in the bed, but OP's partner absolutely is (hence why I called it HER dog because she seems to have less objections to it aka \"loves it more\"), but they can't fight that fight so they choose another battle.", "Exactly.
