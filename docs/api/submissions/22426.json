I can understand not shampooing your hair every night, but only showering maybe 3 times a week?  Yikes.  Btw I am also a shower at night person so you don\u2019t get your sheets dirty.  I mean it seems counterintuitive to go to bed dirty, get your sheets covered in that funk, then continue to stew in dirty sheets until you decide to wash them.\n\nWashing sheets once a week is normal and hygienic, more so if your partner is an occasional showerer.", "Nta", "NTA. My personal preference on changing bed sheets is once every two weeks, but once a week is hardly unusual or excessive. Plus as long as you're the one doing it, it doesn't affect her in any way whatsoever.", "I thought every 7 days was the maximum you should go between washing the sheets.......\n\nNTA at all!", "NTA \n\nFor many years I traveled a lot for work and got used to having the bed sheets changed every third night \n\nI change our bedsheets at least every 3-4 nights", "NTA and your partner is gross.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA on this one, but for a different reason other than my agreeing that once a week is the proper time between washing sheets (I really do agree with that). I agree because if you\u2019re the one making the bed, and washing the bed sheets then it shouldn\u2019t matter how many times you washed them per week/month, you\u2019re the one doing it, not her", " NTA your partner probably smells funky", "NTA - we change our sheets once a week, sometimes every other week if we are busy. It\u2019s normal to change them that often", "NTA. If you ever want to come to my house and clean anything once a week, come on down and knock yourself out. I'm not sure what her problem is if you're the one doing it.", "NTA it\u2019s hygienic to wash them once a week", "NTA if i had dogs sleeping in my bed i would be changing them twice a week. why don't you just get a second set.", "NTA everyone has their own tolerance  for hygiene. Your partner might be feeling like you are somehow calling her dirty by insisting that the sheets be washed every week. \n\nI would discuss it with her to find out if this is really an issue or if its just one of those things you can agree to disagree on. maybe theres more too it than her thinking its wasteful", "NTA.\n\nAh, basic hygiene habits are a good thing. Just show her an article about how dirty/bacteria-filled, etc. dirty sheets and pillow cases are; if it doesn't gross her out, she's questionable....", "So long as you\u2019re the one doing it, NTA? But uh why does this upset her??", "Nta it\u2019s a personal preference and it should defer to the person whose willing to do the work.", "Partner is lazy. Simple as that", "NTA. I may not be able to wash the sheets I just took off my bed, but I have more than one set and wash them at least every other week. Thanks to my old lady cat, I've had to change my sheets up to 3 times in a week, and still had spares (laundry is automatically done when that happens, we have to pay for it so it's extra annoying).", "NTA\n\nAnything less than once a week sounds disgusting. Especially since you have a dog.", "NTA as long as you're doing it yourself.", "NTA a simple google search shows that experts suggest washing sheets 1x a week and less if you don\u2019t sleep in your bed every night. But if you have a pet that sleeps with you the recommendation is to wash sheets every 3-4 days. If the person with higher hygiene expectations is the one doing the labor to maintain that level then the other person should probably zip their lips and enjoy getting to live in a clean environment", "If you're doing it she should not be complaining. NTA", "Once per week is the correct minimum frequency.", "NTA.\n\nWashing the sheets once per week is probably too little if she only washes 3 times per week. What the hell is up with that?\n\nI'd be suggesting you change it once per week and she starts showering everyday like normal people or she has to change it once a week in addition to you doing it.", "NTA\n\nEven if there was no dog in the sheets, washing them once a week is recommended.\n\nYour partner can get over themselves, especially if you're the one doing the washing and making of the bed.", "NTA I personally would be like your partner, my wife changes the sheets twice a week and I let her do it as she is the one who does it, so it's something if I did give off about she would tell me to shut up as she's the one doing it lol", "NTA\n\nYour sheets should be washed once a week, that's just good hygiene and if you are sleeping with someone who regularly comes to bed without showering, all the more reason to wash the sheets.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Weird that she cares so much when it doesn\u2019t affect her.", "I change them twice a week, even if you shower and are clean you do other things in there I asume, so change them at least once a week", "NTA - you should especially wash them once a week since your gf doesn\u2019t shower often", "NAH \n\nYou're both kinda right. Once a week is often and could be wasteful, but if you let the dog up there with you then it's probably needed. \n\nI don't know why so many people are up in their pants about your GF showering three times a week. I doubt she's dirty enough to offset the effect of the dog.", "NTA. You're changing them and doing the laundry. Why is she bitching?", "You are NTA wanting to change and wash your sheets once a week. No offence but your partner showers only three times per week? That sounds yuck tbh. Like you OP I shower daily at least twice a day just to keep me clean day in day out.\n\nAnyway, you are not wrong changing the sheets weekly as you are minimising your chances of falling sick (plus you have a dog that shares the bed with you both) and your partner only baths three times a week", "NTA. Why does she only shower 3x a week?! I wash our bedding once a week, or more if a fun night gets a bit messy.", "as long as you\u2019re the one doing it all because it\u2019s your preference, NTA.", "NAH\n\nEven if it was excessive or unnecessary, you're allowed to have that preference. \n\nBut all things considered I actually agree with you that 1x per week is a good amount, just because you're probably both sweating in your sleep and plus you have a dog in bed with you. (Not that dogs are inherently dirty, just that unless it's a hairless dog, it is probably leaving behind fur on the sheets.)\n\nHowever I don't see your partner as an AH either in this case unless they're being rude about it. They have their preferences, too and that's okay.", "NTA. You\u2019re the one doing the cleaning and you\u2019re the one MAKING the bed. You really aren\u2019t providing any real harm to her in the first place.", "NTA I wash our bed sheets once per week and I wouldn't have it other way, unless it was every 3 or 4 days a week tbh. And We both shower every day and don't sleep with and of our dogs.", "NTA. My SO can wash the sheets every night if she's the one doing it.", "NTA \u2014 once a week is a completely reasonable interval AND you are washing them! You\u2019re even putting them back on! \n\nWith a dog, I\u2019d be doing it more than once a week tbh.", "Oh my... she's a dirty girl. Quit whining and take all of the bedroom benefits she's offering you with this arrangement. Get a little dirty and stop being an A.", "I think your partner simply doesn't want to be involved in making the bed. INFO: Is it difficult for her in some way -- mattress too large/heavy or frustration with fitted sheets snapping up? Maybe see if there is some fix to this.\n\nIf you're washing the bed sheets, then wash them with whatever frequency you want.\n\nI wash mine about 2-3 times a month.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Coming from a culture where you shower at least twice a day, no it is not excessive. You are doing it yourself and not asking for help. I wash my sheets one a week too and if I can't I change the pillow cases.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not abnormal to wash bedding on a weekly basis. Unless your partner never sweats or goes outside and only shower 3x per week, she\u2019s tracking dirt into the bed. Add a dog into the bed with the unwashed GF, and I\u2019d be not sleeping in that dirty bed at all. Yuck.", "Three times a week works out to about every second day, which is a totally reasonable amount of washing. Not everyone showers every day.", "This. Also, 3 times a week isn't nearly enough to actually clean yourself. Wash your hair, sure, but shower...disgusting.", "Three times a week works out to every second day which is generally a fine amount of showering. I shower every second day, sometimes will skip 2 days in the winter if my skin is dry and no one has ever complained.\n\nBut changing bed sheets once a week, especially with a dog sleeping in your bed, is pretty normal.", "Right? Perspiration and other things can happen.", "I would only say so because of the dog. once a week is too much other wise imo", "Pillowcases washed 1x/week can have as much or more bacteria than a toilet seat. So, yea.", "For me personally it's a bit too often too (other than the dog thing), but like I said neither of them are AHs for preferring one way or the other. And op is especially nta because he is the one washing them and making the bed."]}
