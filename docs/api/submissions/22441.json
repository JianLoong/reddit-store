I'm really not sure why, I just can't do it. I'm not sure of it's neurodivergency or something along those lines, but whenever I know someone is watching me eat, I get a choking feeling and I can't eat, it's bad enough that I can't even really swallow when it happens.\n\n At family events, the family would usually go into the dining room and I'd grab my food from there, but then I'd just sit in the kitchen and living room and eat there. It doesn't cause any issues, my family knows about it and they're just like \"ok whatever, we'll talk when we all watch the game together\" or \"we'll get you if we need you.\"\n\nRecently, my family decided to have a July 4th dinner at my brother's house and his wife and him would cook for it. The rest of the family gathers in the dining room and they all sit to eat. Then this exchange happens. \n\nMe: *grabs my food and begins to walk towards the living room*\n\nSIL(sister-in-law): \"um where are you going?\"\n\nMe realizing that she probably doesn't want someone eating in her living room:\n\"OH shit sorry, force of habit, ill be in the kitchen.\"\n\nSIL: \"what? Why?\"\n\nMe: \"so I can eat my food...?\"\n\nSIL: \"oh right, Robert told me about that. I'd much rather have the while family together if that's alright.\"\n\nMe: \"um yea, sure, no problem.\"\n\nI sit at the table and dinner continues. I can't physically eat any of the food so I just strike of conversations with my family around me. About 10 minutes after dinner started, my SIL started asking everyone hiw they thought the food was. The looked at me and asked the same. \n\nMe: \"it looks really good, I can't wait for it later.\"\n\nSIL: \"then why don't you just eat it now?\"\n\nMe: \"because I physically can't\"\n\nSIL: \"ok look, I worked for hours on this meal can you please just eat some of it and be polite for 5 f-ing seconds?\"\n\nI was taken a bit aback and asked: \"didn't my brother explain this to you earlier?\" \nShe said \"yea, but just because your family lets you be rude in their house doesn't mean you get to be rude in mine. So either eat the damn food or please leave.\" \n\nI tried to tell her how I physically can't do that, but then she gets up, wraps my plate and tell me to leave. The room is silent and I just don't bother and leave. \n\nNow my family is upset at her and my SIL blew up my phone saying that she's in trouble with the family and my brother is asking me to apologize and tell everyone to back off just to keep the peace. \n\nHowever, I don't really care. I didn't ask my family to get mad at her, so why would me asking them to stop do anything. It's not my fault she wanted to act like that. Hell, I respected her house and left when she told me to. I said as much to my brother and he understand his wife was being unreasonable, but he's asking me as a brother for a favor. I still haven't decided what to do about all this.\n\nSo, AITA or I guess WIBTA because I didn't eat?", "created_utc": 1689552980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151m99z/aita_for_not_eating_with_everyone_looking_at_me/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s the one who blew it all up.\n\nRealistically though, things like this will keep coming up. When people spend time cooking a nice meal, they like to see people enjoy it. Have you considered seeking therapy to find out why this is such an issue for you?\n\nYou may also run the risk of people thinking you have an eating disorder.

I mean if you're willing to compromise some pride or whatever and apologize to just keep some peace that's fine if you want to. But, you also don't have to do anything. You were completely polite the whole time and shouldn't have to apologise for other people's acting like that. Don't think you could have handled it better.

Hell the fact that your brother explained it to her and she still reacted that way says more about her than it does you. I would say see if she apologizes but i doubt anything out of her mouth would be sincere.", "NTA but i think you should try to work on your problem.
