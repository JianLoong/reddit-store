I'm really not sure why, I just can't do it. I'm not sure of it's neurodivergency or something along those lines, but whenever I know someone is watching me eat, I get a choking feeling and I can't eat, it's bad enough that I can't even really swallow when it happens.\n\n At family events, the family would usually go into the dining room and I'd grab my food from there, but then I'd just sit in the kitchen and living room and eat there. It doesn't cause any issues, my family knows about it and they're just like \"ok whatever, we'll talk when we all watch the game together\" or \"we'll get you if we need you.\"\n\nRecently, my family decided to have a July 4th dinner at my brother's house and his wife and him would cook for it. The rest of the family gathers in the dining room and they all sit to eat. Then this exchange happens. \n\nMe: *grabs my food and begins to walk towards the living room*\n\nSIL(sister-in-law): \"um where are you going?\"\n\nMe realizing that she probably doesn't want someone eating in her living room:\n\"OH shit sorry, force of habit, ill be in the kitchen.\"\n\nSIL: \"what? Why?\"\n\nMe: \"so I can eat my food...?\"\n\nSIL: \"oh right, Robert told me about that. I'd much rather have the while family together if that's alright.\"\n\nMe: \"um yea, sure, no problem.\"\n\nI sit at the table and dinner continues. I can't physically eat any of the food so I just strike of conversations with my family around me. About 10 minutes after dinner started, my SIL started asking everyone hiw they thought the food was. The looked at me and asked the same. \n\nMe: \"it looks really good, I can't wait for it later.\"\n\nSIL: \"then why don't you just eat it now?\"\n\nMe: \"because I physically can't\"\n\nSIL: \"ok look, I worked for hours on this meal can you please just eat some of it and be polite for 5 f-ing seconds?\"\n\nI was taken a bit aback and asked: \"didn't my brother explain this to you earlier?\" \nShe said \"yea, but just because your family lets you be rude in their house doesn't mean you get to be rude in mine. So either eat the damn food or please leave.\" \n\nI tried to tell her how I physically can't do that, but then she gets up, wraps my plate and tell me to leave. The room is silent and I just don't bother and leave. \n\nNow my family is upset at her and my SIL blew up my phone saying that she's in trouble with the family and my brother is asking me to apologize and tell everyone to back off just to keep the peace. \n\nHowever, I don't really care. I didn't ask my family to get mad at her, so why would me asking them to stop do anything. It's not my fault she wanted to act like that. Hell, I respected her house and left when she told me to. I said as much to my brother and he understand his wife was being unreasonable, but he's asking me as a brother for a favor. I still haven't decided what to do about all this.\n\nSo, AITA or I guess WIBTA because I didn't eat?", "created_utc": 1689552980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151m99z/aita_for_not_eating_with_everyone_looking_at_me/", "score": 1227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you considered seeking therapy to find out why this is such an issue for you?\n\nYou may also run the risk of people thinking you have an eating disorder.

I mean if you're willing to compromise some pride or whatever and apologize to just keep some peace that's fine if you want to. But, you also don't have to do anything. You were completely polite the whole time and shouldn't have to apologise for other people's acting like that. Don't think you could have handled it better.

Hell the fact that your brother explained it to her and she still reacted that way says more about her than it does you. I would say see if she apologizes but i doubt anything out of her mouth would be sincere.", "NTA but i think you should try to work on your problem.

I\u2019m hoping to add questions about it to a future survey. I have a few theories about why: \n\n1. Overstimulation: Chewing noises from others eating, plus flavor, plus texture, plus any conversation, adds up to a lot and may create stress that makes eating difficult.\n\n2. Too many social rules: some things you eat with fork and knife, some things fingers, too big a bite looks piggish but too small looks attention-seeking or condescending, sometimes eating with food in your mouth open is a huge no, but if asked a direct question it may be okay to cover your mouth and give a very quick response\u2026 etc. If you struggle to read social situations and are placed in a situation with so many rules that can change in so many ways, that creates a lot of anxiety.\n\n3. Prejudice: people get judged for being too heavy, judged for being too skinny\u2026 if you already know you don\u2019t quite fit in, any opportunity to cause people to judge you more (ate too much / too little, used too much salt, chose fattening items, etc) is a cause for anxiety.\n\n4. Trauma: Autistic kids are much more likely to be picky eaters, and especially to struggle with texture. Some parents try to force their picky eaters to eat things they don\u2019t like, which their brain has decided is toxic/inedible so eating it is incredibly difficult. This can be traumatic if done especially badly, which can lead to an avoidance of family meal times.\n\nI haven\u2019t actually conducted a study (yet) to determine whether it\u2019s really more common for autistic folks, but anecdotally, everyone I know who hates eating in front of people is autistic, and it\u2019s something like 1/3 of the autistic folks I know. For me it\u2019s mostly the social rules and prejudice; I remember in high school I was very thin, and I\u2019d take multiple bites to eat an m&m if anyone could see me because I was so scared of people thinking I was a pig. In undergrad, I\u2019d skip meals if my roommates were in the kitchen and would see what I\u2019d chosen, even if they wouldn\u2019t actually see me eat it. Realizing why it was hard helped me work on it, then eating in front of people I really trusted and having positive experiences helped even more.

Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you won't always be able to be alone. If you ever choose to have kids, you can't avoid eating around them.

Because *the client* decided there is something *that is not working for them and that they want to change* and they collaborate with a *trusted clinician in a positive and safe therapeutic alliance* to do carefully planned exposure therapies to build distress tolerance. \n\nWhat SIL did was the equivalent of throwing a toddler in a pool to teach them to swim. \n\nThat decision to change or not change has to be up to OP and only OP.\n\nI am on the autism spectrum and there are lots of ways in which I've devised strategies to conquer my own demand avoidance in safe ways.

Just an FYI CBT can be really bad for ND people, especially if the therapist/counselor isn't adept at mixing/choosing appropriate modalities.

It has nothing to do with 'changing' yourself.\nMy point would apply to neurotypical people as well. \n\n I understand it wasnt taken in bad faith, but I do find your tone to be of somebody trying to school me on something, when youre unaware of my personal lived experiences. Im unsure of why this went into pack animal territory and am aware that people present an image of themselves to public and peers that isnt an accurate representation of their true self.  \n\nWith all due respect not everybody has energy to respond to a massive amount of text, especially when it wasnt relevant to the point they were making. I'm not saying what you said is irrelevant or unimportant, but it had nothing to do with what I was saying.\nI hope you find this absolute wall of text less dismissive.", "I find the fact that you continue to revise your responses to me for many minutes after original interactions fascinating, yes, and certainly less dismissive. \n\nI disagree that my response to your original post was irrelevant to your point, but lets agree to disagree. You aptly say that there are ways to work on issues to be more functional, which you are using as a synonym for comfortable, and I agree with that based on your clarification. I merely remarked that that's up to OP, not OP's SIL, and that based on OP's own self-description, this way of functioning works/ has worked for her up until this point. \n\nYou're right, I don't know your personal experience. You don't offer it and you don't have to. At the risk of patronizing you, there is a tremendous backlash in the autism community about Applied Behavior Analysis that has been the gold star standard for therapy with ASD people since forever. I won't say any more on that since this is 4 paragraphs. I deleted a line break to make it 3.", "I revise my responses because I'm absolutely whacked on opiates (not recreationally) and am struggling to articulate myself. I'm glad you find it so fascinating - you maybe wouldn't if you were experiencing it firsthand. \n\nWe can agree to disagree, sure. I honestly don't understand what you're trying to say. You're clarifying that I appropriately (aptly)  used functional as a synonym for comfortable? \n{Edit: I agree that it must be down to OP. Nothing changes until somebody is ready.}\nIf OP physically cannot swallow food in other people's presence and their only coping mechanism is avoidance, it's maybe not working so well. \n\n\nThat's interesting to know. Again, not what I was saying but it's still interesting to know.\nThanks for the line break, and making sure to be super patronising about this and not about  applied behaviour analysis :)"]}
