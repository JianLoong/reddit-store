{"id": 6860, "submission_id": "106xb7c", "title": "AITA for not giving my son a bath", "selftext": "I (24 f) have a 3 year old toddler. He and I live with my mother (44) and my grandmother (77). I work five days out of the week, noon to 8, but I leave at 11 am, and usually get home between 8:15 to 8:30 depending on traffic, however starting tomorrow I won't be home until closer to 9:30 on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays. My mother and grandmother don't work and just stay at home all day with my son and also take care of my 15 year old brother and sister. Since I'm off two days a week, I usually use those days to clean the never ending mess in the house, try to gather my laundry since I leave it in the hall so my cats don't tear them up, or I try to take care of my rapidly declining mental health. Needless to say, I'm exhausted 24/7 and always taking care of something. My mom and grandma keep berating me for the fact that it's been a month since his hair has been washed, but I'm rarely home, and when I do get home, he's already dressed for bed, and my two days off I'm so bust I barely even take care of myself. Now I don't expect my grandma to do much with him other than sit with him to make sure he doesn't hurt himself, but I'm frustrated that my mom doesn't do much. When she's not taking her kids to school and picking them, she sits at home and reads her books or watches Netflix. I'm tired of the two of them ganging up on for not giving him a bath when I'm barely home. Even my boyfriend (23) will say thing like \"oh,  you have a kid?\" Everytime I mention something about my son even though he knows I do. I know he's just being sarcastic, but it hurts me every time. Being here with them is driving me crazy and it's a struggle trying to repair my mental well being when they're chiseling away at my hard work, but the moment I mention wanting to leave, they start crying, wailing almost, telling me not to take their baby, they have nothing to live for without him. It feels like he's only \"my baby\" when it's convent for them and I don't know what else to do. If I say anything to them about it they throw \" well he's your kid\" or \"humph having a baby and not taking care of it, what a woman you are\" coming from my mom and grandma, respectively. Sometimes I feel like throwing their own words back at them, but it won't solve anything. This was more of a rant than anything, but I wanted to just get it off my chest and ask if I'm as big of AH as my family says I am.\n\n\n***EDIT***\nI'm sorry, I should have worded things better. He does usually get a bath at least once a week or after an extremely dirty day, but he hasn't had his hair washed in a while, which I know is still bad. My son hates get his hair wet in the bath, but is fine with pool time. Everytime we try to wash his hair, he'll scream bloody murder, and then my grandma will start screaming at us assuming we're \"hurting her baby\" and no matter how many times we try telling her that we're just washing his hair, we're not hurting him at all, she doesn't care and keeps screaming at us to leave him alone. My brother, who helps me a lot with bathtime, and my sister, who sometimes gives him a bath, don't want to hear her yell at them, so they just get him in, rinse him off, let him soak for a bit and get him out. Usually it's my mom or I that do bath and hair and just deal with her screaming on top of his wailing. Because I've been gone and busy I assumed that they had been giving him baths and washing his hair, but my mom mentioned it to me recently, within the last few days (honestly every day has been running into each lately so I can't remember when a day stops and the next begins, but I know it's been within this past week) that he hasn't had his hair washed in over a month and I just stared at her dumbfounded as to why she didn't wash it sooner instead of complain to me about it after it's been so long. I do realize it's my responsibility to take care of him, and I'm not trying to push the blame, I just couldn't fathom watching someone else child and not clean them if they're dirty especially if you know they're extremely busy.\n\n***EDIT 2***\n\nFor those confused how i have time for a boyfriend but not my son, I don't. He lives with me, we started dating when I was still in college, when I actually had time to be social and take care of my son. As of August we've been more roommates than anything, going out for dinner here and there after I get out of work, a,d the most interaction he's had with my son as far as I know was playing ball with him once on Thanksgiving, and telling him he was going to be gone for a while because he was really sick (cancerous mass in the throat that nee#ed emergency surgery) and that he might not be coming back home, to which my son replied in typical toddler fashion \" ohhh allrigghhhtt, bye bye tall man\"", "created_utc": 1673219063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106xb7c/aita_for_not_giving_my_son_a_bath/", "score": 2459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother and grandmother don't work and just stay at home all day with my son and also take care of my 15 year old brother and sister. Since I'm off two days a week, I usually use those days to clean the never ending mess in the house, try to gather my laundry since I leave it in the hall so my cats don't tear them up, or I try to take care of my rapidly declining mental health. Needless to say, I'm exhausted 24/7 and always taking care of something. My mom and grandma keep berating me for the fact that it's been a month since his hair has been washed, but I'm rarely home, and when I do get home, he's already dressed for bed, and my two days off I'm so bust I barely even take care of myself. Now I don't expect my grandma to do much with him other than sit with him to make sure he doesn't hurt himself, but I'm frustrated that my mom doesn't do much. When she's not taking her kids to school and picking them, she sits at home and reads her books or watches Netflix. I'm tired of the two of them ganging up on for not giving him a bath when I'm barely home. Even my boyfriend (23) will say thing like \"oh,  you have a kid?\" Everytime I mention something about my son even though he knows I do. I know he's just being sarcastic, but it hurts me every time. Being here with them is driving me crazy and it's a struggle trying to repair my mental well being when they're chiseling away at my hard work, but the moment I mention wanting to leave, they start crying, wailing almost, telling me not to take their baby, they have nothing to live for without him. It feels like he's only \"my baby\" when it's convent for them and I don't know what else to do. If I say anything to them about it they throw \" well he's your kid\" or \"humph having a baby and not taking care of it, what a woman you are\" coming from my mom and grandma, respectively.

The solution offered to me was: either hold still to have my hair taken care of or get it cut. I got it cut. And magically that huge source of conflict and strife just disappeared. Your son is too young to make that kind of bargain with so you have to do what is best for him.

If mom/grandma resist helping see if you can get buy in from your siblings and if they will help with the new earlier bed times.

Even if you start with half days or full days where someone else picks him up and keeps him until your home. Some nurseries offer to do bath times and into pyjamas -that might work for you.  Your son needs more activities/ interaction/socialisation than he is getting. If you feel you need to sell it your mom/grandmas tell them that kids in day care do better long term that those that don't go.\n4c. Next find somewhere new to live. You don't need your mom/grandmas permission. If all you can afford is a 1 bed then take that. You and son can comfortably share for a few years. If its in reasonable distance your mom/grandma can still assist with childcare (would be better if they didnt) so you arent taking him away or you could see if your brother and/or sister would be willing to help (pay them if you can  or offer other compensation, they might just be glad for a quite, calmer place to do homework.)\n4d. Once you have a new living situation (that order is better for your credit) look for a new job, something with better more standard hours and hopefully a shorter commute.\n\n5. Once you've got your head above water again, consider cutting down you mom/grandmas involvement in your life. Limit babysitting (they seem to foist it off on your siblings anyway) and put them on a low info diet.\n\n6. You need to work on your own mental health. 6a Youre clearly feeling disconnected from your kid. Start setting time to spend solely focused on  him even 15 minutes every day. Do something that connects you read stories, play with his brick/cars whatever (not screen time) on the weekend spend a little longer and do activities like arts and craft or baking. Take him to the library for storytime ( borrow books whilst your there) 6b. Set 15 minutes aside every day just for you -do something calming, paint your nails/toe nails, do some you or meditation, read a book etc focus on breathing. Maybe talk to you doctor if you think you could use some help (no shame in the medication  game).\n\n7. If there are thing about your son that you need to track you could an app to help (a coparenting type one would have a lot of the feature you need) or write a chart and stick it to the wall. Put things like bath, hair wash, teeth brush, what he ate (is he getting a healthy balanced diet) what his sleep schedule is supposed to be and what he actually slept that day, read story, got exercise, left the house etc. Even if they don't/won't fill it in properly it gives you a starting point and the rest you can find out through general chitchat. Ultimately its your responsibility to ensure his needs are being met.\n\n8. Listen to snoop doggs kids songs with your son. Vibe out", "Posts like these made me glad I got myself snipped. It's your responsibility to raise your kid.

I think it's tad disturbing that the kid as a bath once a week. \n\nIf cleaning up the mess ends up being too much, why not also get your siblings to help out more and try incentives (extra pocket money, treat, etc) in return? \n\nAll in all, YTA", "ESH. I am sorry to have to say that. I have three kids myself so I get being exhausted after working. That doesn\u2019t mean you get to abdicate your responsibility to the child you created and brought into the world.

He isn\u2019t their baby. He\u2019s yours. You need to step up and be his mom. Children, especially toddlers, need routine in their lives and it sounds like his schedule and routine and just daily life is all over the place. There is no reason he should be in bed still at 11am. There is no reason he should be staying up all night and going to bed at potentially 6am. There is no reason he should not be getting bathed at least every other day, including getting his hair washed. Some kids hate baths and getting washed. It\u2019s normal. It still has to happen. Try teaching him how to tilt his head back so water and soap don\u2019t fall into his eyes as you bathe him, and like others have said, it doesn\u2019t HAVE to be nightly. It could be something you do in the morning when you both wake up. Make it a fun bonding time with you two. Get some bath toys and let him spend 10 minutes just playing with you and making up silly stories and situations with the bath toys. Remind him he has to be washed to stay healthy, and as his mom, you want him to be healthy because you love him. I get that your mental health isn\u2019t the best but you may find that by starting this routine with him, you\u2019ll start to feel better. I had bad postpartum depression with my first child. I felt like I couldn\u2019t do anything right and that he was clearly going to turn out awful because I was the worst parent ever. That wasn\u2019t true and he\u2019s a super well adjusted kid now and I love him and my other children more than I could ever adequately express. But I had to let go of the feelings of inadequacy and do what was best for him and for my other children, too.

Don\u2019t let your mom and grandma berate you for trying your best for your kid, but make sure you actually ARE trying your best for your kid. You are his mom and he loves you but he needs you to set the boundaries, set the schedule, and make sure other caregivers know what they are and that they support it.

Now that I live with my fiance, we are both adults and try to pick up after ourselves. This distribution of labor is abusive.\n\nKick the bf out. He seems useless and is a leech.\n\nTry to get your kiddo onto a consistent sleep schedule and then enroll into pre-K. Your family is doing him no favors. \n\nAlso it could behoove you to look into WFH jobs if you can. Leaves more time for you in the day and it can help you get your son into a consistent schedule.\n\nLastly, move out. Ignore anything your family says to make you not do so.

They aren\u2019t responsible for childcare, but if they live in the house, they can contribute too. \n\nCheck into your local social services to see if you qualify for childcare.

You may not have realized what you were signing up for, but you\u2019re in it now and you seriously need to pull it together. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s job to help you care for or raise your child. The fact that you didn\u2019t notice his hair hasn\u2019t been washed is crazy to me. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna have to find a way to manage your time better, shift your schedule around and be more present. At least find time to wash his hair once a week. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have time for a boyfriend or \u201cgoing out for dinner\u201d after work. You need to learn to prioritize girl. A relationship isn\u2019t a priority. What you\u2019re doing clearly isn\u2019t working and a lot of figuring out how to be a mom comes with trial and error. Clearly this part is an error, and that\u2019s okay, but you need to try something new and learn how to slowly evolve into this new challenging and rewarding role. No one can do that for you. Stop making excuses and start making changes.", "Nta. I was in this type of situation right after having my son. Stayed with my dad and when I worked he would watch him. But I was expected to feed and change my son before leaving for work at 5 30am everyday. Somedays he barely ate or was dry. But I would still come home and get yelled at for not taking care of my son if my dad had to wake up early and take care of him. I got tired of it quickly and moved out. They were hurt by it but I needed my freedom. Parents don't notice it but they put a lot of unneeded pressure on adult children and your mom doing it is probably contributing to your stress. I would move out for you and your child's sake. Your mental health is more important than keeping your son around his grandparents. Another good reason to move out is that you can have more control over your sons schedule and have a routine that will fit your work hours. Grandma won't have him ready for bed if you need to pick him up and take him home.", "ESH.  How are there THIS many people living in the house and not a single one of you can provide consistent care for your kid?

OP, no offense, but no one is responsible for your kid except you. This is the part where I think you're in the wrong. Your mother and grandmother don't have an obligation to give your kid a bath. They sound like they are already helping you by watching the kid and saving you money on daycare and rent. \n\nWhere I think they are wrong is how they react to you threatening to move out. That is some real emotional manipulation there and it sounds toxic. That is something you should address with them. \n\nOP honestly, I have a sister that is a single mother and while I don't have kids, I think she leans too much on my parents with the kid. This sounds similar. \n\nAnd quite frankly, your brother shouldn't have to help you with baths. My sister knows I'd never do that with her kid and we all lived under the safe roof for nearly a year after the kid was born. \n\nLong answer, you gotta suck it up.

You leave dirty clothes in the hall, your cats destroy things, your boyfriend is just a random roommate. You are unaware of your boyfriends interactions with your son. Your son doesnt sound like he has a regular schedule nor a regular caretaker (you? Your mom grandma brother sister? Each hoping someone took care of his needs?). \n\nGetting a regular schedule will be a huge first step in helping you and him. Get up at a normal time with him. Spend mornings with him taking care of him, including washing his hair. Work with him to become used to it. If everyone isnjust rinsing (not even washing!?) Him, screaming in the bathroom, and take him out when he screams - what an insanely stressful routine for him. And have you checked to see if anything is actually physically wrong with his scalp? Not being washed for a month - he may have something going on, irritated, whatever. Even if everything is fine with his scalp, washing month-old toddler bits out of his hair is of course traumatizing.\n\nHave your family help put him to bed at a normal time. You go to bed at a normal time.  Sit with your family and find out what's been done to take care of him each day. Create a routine for him. Get rid of your \"boyfriend.\"\n\nAnd having a routine for the living beings will make it easier to start baby steps on other routines. Laundry gets thrown into the washer on your way to work, switched to dryer after work. Folded before bed. Whatever works. \n\nThe whole situation sounds bad. But you're his mother so responsibility falls squarely on your shoulders.", "I haven't washed my hair for approximately 5 years. Using shampoo causes a circle of needing shampoo, because it forces the scalp(?) to produce more.fat.to protect itself, thus making the hair look greasy. Rinsing is fine, so I suggest pool time to let him \"rinse\" it himself. Perhaps om the morning before you go to work? Maybe even ocean time in the summer? Do look after him though, it only takes 2 minutes to drown in freshwater and 4 minutes in salt water.", "ESH\n\nAt least wash your son every other day. \n\nAlso, is your son black? It almost reads like a white parent not sure how to take care of textured hair.

Your mother and grandmother are displaying narcissistic tendencies and you definitely have some mental health concerns you still need to address. \nThe boyfriend, I think you should consider where he needs to be on the priority list and possibly put your relationship on hold for a bit so you can put more of your focus on your son. Right now, your son is being failed and you have a responsibility as a mother to care for him properly which is definitely more than hard in that household.\nSave up and leave asap, don't even tell them you plan to. But do this for your SON and make sure he's cared for. I know you're struggling but you have a child now and you matter but so does your son. You don't live for yourself anymore when you bring life into this world, you live for that child and your current situation is very unsafe for him and will NEVER be properly safe as a living environment.

They are a single mother's gift from above! I used to put my daughter in her's when I took a shower. Just put it in the shower with you, out of the direct spray. You can get you both clean during your shower. It's also a lot of fun! Sing to your baby and make it a game. Or take a bath together. ( Baby does need to be old enough to sit up safely alone. The seat will keep them upright and in place, but aren't appropriate for a new infant. ) \n\nYou have a lot going on Momma, and it's probably hard to see a different way to do things when you are in the middle of it. Take this ONE thing and make a change. It will give you time to bond with your baby, and it's something you both really need to have in your routine. \n\nI also think you should look up local resources for mothers.

My guess is she feels as if she has no other choice due to finances, she probably thinks living with her family is more affordable for herself and her son, or she's been a doormat for so long that she hasn't gotten to the point where she just takes her child and leaves. There's probably more to the cats being shut in a room than just the clothes being torn, if it was just because the cats would claw her clothes then why wouldn't she lock the clothes in her room and let the cats be in the hallway? Probably the cats haven't been trained to not scratch anything because the adults and teens at home besides her don't want to be bothered, and she's tired from struggling to balance holding down a job, parenting, and playing maid, so in order to keep the furniture from getting clawed the family keeps the cats in the doormat's room to protect their own possessions, and OP keeps her clothes safe by putting her laundry in the hallway. And I believe OP does have her son as her first priority -- hence the fact that she goes to work and makes money instead of just living off other people while not bathing her child. She's just overwhelmed and railroaded to the point she hasn't found a way to take her child and leave. She needs a support system and/or an exit.", "Her grandma sounds like a monster.

What do you consider holding a job to receive money to provide for her child to be, then? Not responsible? Is having a job that pays money which are used for bills and the care of her child not a part of tending to her responsibilities? And yet I have a guess that if she was jobless you would be saying she's the AH for not financially providing for her child, because *hey*, it's 2023 and equality.\n\nReally, it should be obvious... even in today's world, and especially on Reddit... it is still usually single women are judged more unfairly for having a job (which pays the bills) and aren't home \"enough\" to care for her children, than single men are for having a job (which pays the bills) and aren't home \"enough\" to care for his children.\n\nAnd let's not forget there are two other adults (OP said Mom only reads books and sends teens FF to school) and two teenagers who could help pick up the slack in housecleaning. Before you tell me \"it's not their job\", actually, when you're part of a family and there are unfortunate circumstances, it *is* part of your damn job to help your family through their unfortunate circumstances. Your relatives are not your paycheck or your servants, and in a healthy family dynamic you should be willing to step up and support each other as it is needed. At least that's how I was raised. Yet after reading OP's post, it seems that OP is the only one expected to help. Who else is cleaning in their shared living spaces, besides her? Who else is contributing financially, since she is not the only adult? And if boyfriend doesn't want to help take care of OP's son, even if it's just a little bit, while OP is at work earning money, then he needs to communicate that in a crystal clear way to OP at once, instead of making snide comments like a high school child.\n\nSo I will just say it again: instead of hardballing an overwhelmed OP who seems to be breaking under the stress of being the main breadwinner, *plus* being the main caretaker of at least two adults (herself and boyfriend) if not more of the family too, *plus* being the parent of a child, *plus* being the main housekeeper, I'm advising OP to find a home that is just for herself and her son. My Mom had cancer and the chemo made it hard to do much besides lay down, so I understand that OP's boyfriend might not be capable of working or housekeeping right now; but if OP chooses to take son and boyfriend to a new home, if boyfriend is on chemo he can lay down in the living room while keeping an eye on OP's son to make sure he doesn't run with scissors or eat a pencil, and OP could always prepare PB&J sandwiches in baggies in the morning to be grabbed from the table by her hungry hungry hippos at lunch time. And again, if the boyfriend has no interest in partnering in parentship of his SO's child, he needs to be upfront and clear about it right now. Snide toxic comments is not a healthy form of communication.\n\nAdditionally, if I'm wrong and OP really is being irresponsible, this is the perfect way to help her become more responsible or to have CPS look into the matter.", "Right, but I took that as he wasn't joking. She seems really out of touch...", "That's fair. Mine gets a bit of baby dandruff going on if I don't wash his scalp every other day or so, but if your kid has a different texture and hair wash schedule then that makes sense. OP does not seem to have a schedule and seems to just assume that other people are doing something that they're not doing.", "I have a nephew around that age...

They are generous in baby sitting and feeding/putting the child to sleep.

If she is, then she should absolutely get out and I\u2019m sure daycare is cheaper than paying for 2 adults, a teenager and a hobosexual.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting vibes if possible council house. Possibly owned by the grandmother who would have a pension and mother has benefits. In that case they\u2019d be housing her still", "Not only that, the grandma sounds like she needs full-time care herself. Screaming and wailing that OP is \u2018hurting *her* baby\u2019? Because he\u2019s getting a bath? That\u2019s bizarre.", "I can\u2019t believe this many people upvoted a huge assumption. Besides the whole point of this post is she\u2019s neglecting her child. It has nothing to do with who pays what. She had a baby, so he\u2019s her responsibility. They watch him all day. OP is just trying to make someone else even more involved in caring for the baby.

I have multiple cats that are VERY active and love to get into stuff. They have never, in the many years I've had them (youngest is over 10 years old) ripped up my clothes. Even if clothing gets onto the floor, they don't rip it up. If I drop a shirt, they might lay on it but they don't destroy it. I suspect the animals are not being adequately cared for either if they are that destructive.", "I\u2019ve got a 3 year old and 1 year old boy.

CPS needs to be involved in this disaster.", "Hell, I use to rescue cats. I've had tons of cats in my house at different points, some with disabilities, some with very bad behavioural issues, etc. Never once did those cats destroy my clothes, even the ones who were the most difficult to work with.\n\nThose cats are definitely being neglected.", "I stuck on the cats, plural, being locked together in a single bedroom full time?  like they keep their laundry in the hall so they don't tear their clothes up... maybe the cats wouldn't be tearing things up if they had room to run around and things to play with and scratch at?", "That's what me a day hubby do. One of us bathes with the toddler while the other bathes the baby. It alternates.", "Apparent she has a useless BF. Honestly, all adults suck here.", "But you care for him. You aren't bathing your child daily because of a medical condition. He is still being kept clean. That's entirely understandable. This child on the other hand is being neglected.", "Yes hours of the day aren\u2019t standard but number of hours certainly are.", "Right. She does what millions of parents do every day. Yet she has free childcare for 12 plus hours of the day. And she still can\u2019t do the most basic of needs for her child. Wake up at 7/8 am when your kid does. Feed him breakfast and then give him a bath/shower. You still have an hour or two before you need to leave at 11am. My god", "Maybe yes.

That\u2019s way too little washing.", "He's obviously being sarcastic and trying to make her realize that she needs to take care of her kid and spend time with him. Like at one of my old jobs, I had a manager who never spent any time with her kid, and the joke would be that \"does she even have a kid\" (the manager was also a terrible manager) OP needs to grow up like being exhausted is a part of being a parent high key", "If all else fails, a wet warm facecloth will get the worst of the gunk off.

I have had oily skin and hair since I hit puberty with no signs of it going away (my mom still has oily skin post menopause but her hair has gotten less oily through dying and now turning grey). No matter how many times I tried to \"train\" my hair so that I could go without shampooing more than a day it never takes since the underlying issue is I have oily skin (that I regularly cleanse and use products specifically for oily skin).", "Yeah it sounds like she's got cats locked in her room all day on top of the child neglect", "Hey, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re swamped and I hope you see this because I think a lot of people here aren\u2019t reading between the lines. I come from a family like yours. Generational poverty. I\u2019m gonna guess white trash because that\u2019s what my family are.

Mom doesn\u2019t work because she\u2019s on disability maybe?\n\nYou\u2019re deeply depressed because you\u2019re in a fucked up environment. Your son is suffering. Grandma is fucking abusive for screaming like that and disrupting his care. You need to GET OUT. Get out, seriously, SAVE YOUR SON and also yourself. No possible way to afford to get out? Start an apprenticeship in one of the trades while you\u2019re at home. Welding, plumbing, electrical if you\u2019ve got the math skills. You\u2019ll still be working a ton but it\u2019ll be enough to make a living on. Personally I do hair which is more flexible but less pay to start. But do what you gotta do to get a career going while you\u2019ve got the built in, albeit shitty, childcare. And then get out.\n\nAs long as you stay there you will feel this way. Your environment is suffocating you. We both know that people who stay turn into our parents. You wanna live in a crowded cat pee house forever? Eventually be the one running it and having various kids and cousins living with you so that you never get to retire in peace, never learn how to have boundaries and personal space?\n\nI got out and you can too. Break the cycle.

That will help prevent the screaming. \n\nI sympathize with her. When my kid was a baby, I lived with my husband, mother-in-law and brother, and I was the only one working. I also did most of the cooking and cleaning, and I was caring for my child! I was exhausted all the time. It was only when I threatened to leave that they pulled themselves together.

Obviously, depends on how dirty they played, whether they had an explosive diaper, or whatnot. \n\nI don't think 1 bath a week necessarily indicates borderline neglect. Obviously, washing hair should be part of that bath, and washing kids face with a washcloth every night is recommended.\n\nETA: The circumstances in this particular situation do seem like the child is not receiving enough hygiene care. but 1 bath a week isn't by definition neglect.", "The boyfriend apparently lives with her as well?? Which makes this even more bizarre.", "Because grandma doesnt actually cares, she just makes OP tired.", "Word! That\u2019s exactly it lol. I\u2019ve done this.

Thanks.", ">I take a shower/bath with my toddler so it's easier.\n\nMy kids can NOT handle showers, my husband has tried several times when they wander into the bathroom when he's showering, to get them to hop in...  but they freak out.\n\nIt may be that my eldest has ADHD, but we've had to work carefully with him, about exactly how we wash his hair, otherwise (like OP experiences) he just yells and screams and splashes around, and there's no way to not get water in his eyes that way, which makes things worse...  so we discuss what we're going to do (him lay down into the water, or holding a towel over his face, or whatever technique he wants to use that day), to get him to wet his hair so we can wash it.\n\nNo amount of offering rewards, or threatening consequences (no videos today unless you let us wash your hair) make any difference, when they normally work in other situations.  Just being calm and letting him feel like he has some control is all that's needed, but it does make bath time take twice as long, because he has to be talked through the whole thing.\n\nJust because it's easy for you and your kids, doesn't mean every kid can be handled the same way.", "My hair is very curly and I only wash it about once a week because it\u2019s pretty dry naturally.
