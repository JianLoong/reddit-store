{"id": 6860, "submission_id": "106xb7c", "title": "AITA for not giving my son a bath", "selftext": "I (24 f) have a 3 year old toddler. He and I live with my mother (44) and my grandmother (77). I work five days out of the week, noon to 8, but I leave at 11 am, and usually get home between 8:15 to 8:30 depending on traffic, however starting tomorrow I won't be home until closer to 9:30 on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays. My mother and grandmother don't work and just stay at home all day with my son and also take care of my 15 year old brother and sister. Since I'm off two days a week, I usually use those days to clean the never ending mess in the house, try to gather my laundry since I leave it in the hall so my cats don't tear them up, or I try to take care of my rapidly declining mental health. Needless to say, I'm exhausted 24/7 and always taking care of something. My mom and grandma keep berating me for the fact that it's been a month since his hair has been washed, but I'm rarely home, and when I do get home, he's already dressed for bed, and my two days off I'm so bust I barely even take care of myself. Now I don't expect my grandma to do much with him other than sit with him to make sure he doesn't hurt himself, but I'm frustrated that my mom doesn't do much. When she's not taking her kids to school and picking them, she sits at home and reads her books or watches Netflix. I'm tired of the two of them ganging up on for not giving him a bath when I'm barely home. Even my boyfriend (23) will say thing like \"oh,  you have a kid?\" Everytime I mention something about my son even though he knows I do. I know he's just being sarcastic, but it hurts me every time. Being here with them is driving me crazy and it's a struggle trying to repair my mental well being when they're chiseling away at my hard work, but the moment I mention wanting to leave, they start crying, wailing almost, telling me not to take their baby, they have nothing to live for without him. It feels like he's only \"my baby\" when it's convent for them and I don't know what else to do. If I say anything to them about it they throw \" well he's your kid\" or \"humph having a baby and not taking care of it, what a woman you are\" coming from my mom and grandma, respectively. Sometimes I feel like throwing their own words back at them, but it won't solve anything. This was more of a rant than anything, but I wanted to just get it off my chest and ask if I'm as big of AH as my family says I am.\n\n\n***EDIT***\nI'm sorry, I should have worded things better. He does usually get a bath at least once a week or after an extremely dirty day, but he hasn't had his hair washed in a while, which I know is still bad. My son hates get his hair wet in the bath, but is fine with pool time. Everytime we try to wash his hair, he'll scream bloody murder, and then my grandma will start screaming at us assuming we're \"hurting her baby\" and no matter how many times we try telling her that we're just washing his hair, we're not hurting him at all, she doesn't care and keeps screaming at us to leave him alone. My brother, who helps me a lot with bathtime, and my sister, who sometimes gives him a bath, don't want to hear her yell at them, so they just get him in, rinse him off, let him soak for a bit and get him out. Usually it's my mom or I that do bath and hair and just deal with her screaming on top of his wailing. Because I've been gone and busy I assumed that they had been giving him baths and washing his hair, but my mom mentioned it to me recently, within the last few days (honestly every day has been running into each lately so I can't remember when a day stops and the next begins, but I know it's been within this past week) that he hasn't had his hair washed in over a month and I just stared at her dumbfounded as to why she didn't wash it sooner instead of complain to me about it after it's been so long. I do realize it's my responsibility to take care of him, and I'm not trying to push the blame, I just couldn't fathom watching someone else child and not clean them if they're dirty especially if you know they're extremely busy.\n\n***EDIT 2***\n\nFor those confused how i have time for a boyfriend but not my son, I don't. He lives with me, we started dating when I was still in college, when I actually had time to be social and take care of my son. As of August we've been more roommates than anything, going out for dinner here and there after I get out of work, a,d the most interaction he's had with my son as far as I know was playing ball with him once on Thanksgiving, and telling him he was going to be gone for a while because he was really sick (cancerous mass in the throat that nee#ed emergency surgery) and that he might not be coming back home, to which my son replied in typical toddler fashion \" ohhh allrigghhhtt, bye bye tall man\"", "created_utc": 1673219063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106xb7c/aita_for_not_giving_my_son_a_bath/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The solution offered to me was: either hold still to have my hair taken care of or get it cut. I got it cut. And magically that huge source of conflict and strife just disappeared. Your son is too young to make that kind of bargain with so you have to do what is best for him.

If mom/grandma resist helping see if you can get buy in from your siblings and if they will help with the new earlier bed times.

Even if you start with half days or full days where someone else picks him up and keeps him until your home. Some nurseries offer to do bath times and into pyjamas -that might work for you.  Your son needs more activities/ interaction/socialisation than he is getting. If you feel you need to sell it your mom/grandmas tell them that kids in day care do better long term that those that don't go.\n4c. Next find somewhere new to live. You don't need your mom/grandmas permission. If all you can afford is a 1 bed then take that. You and son can comfortably share for a few years. If its in reasonable distance your mom/grandma can still assist with childcare (would be better if they didnt) so you arent taking him away or you could see if your brother and/or sister would be willing to help (pay them if you can  or offer other compensation, they might just be glad for a quite, calmer place to do homework.)\n4d. Once you have a new living situation (that order is better for your credit) look for a new job, something with better more standard hours and hopefully a shorter commute.\n\n5. Once you've got your head above water again, consider cutting down you mom/grandmas involvement in your life. Limit babysitting (they seem to foist it off on your siblings anyway) and put them on a low info diet.\n\n6. You need to work on your own mental health. 6a Youre clearly feeling disconnected from your kid. Start setting time to spend solely focused on  him even 15 minutes every day. Do something that connects you read stories, play with his brick/cars whatever (not screen time) on the weekend spend a little longer and do activities like arts and craft or baking. Take him to the library for storytime ( borrow books whilst your there) 6b. Set 15 minutes aside every day just for you -do something calming, paint your nails/toe nails, do some you or meditation, read a book etc focus on breathing. Maybe talk to you doctor if you think you could use some help (no shame in the medication  game).\n\n7. If there are thing about your son that you need to track you could an app to help (a coparenting type one would have a lot of the feature you need) or write a chart and stick it to the wall. Put things like bath, hair wash, teeth brush, what he ate (is he getting a healthy balanced diet) what his sleep schedule is supposed to be and what he actually slept that day, read story, got exercise, left the house etc. Even if they don't/won't fill it in properly it gives you a starting point and the rest you can find out through general chitchat. Ultimately its your responsibility to ensure his needs are being met.\n\n8. Listen to snoop doggs kids songs with your son. Vibe out", "Posts like these made me glad I got myself snipped. It's your responsibility to raise your kid.

I think it's tad disturbing that the kid as a bath once a week. \n\nIf cleaning up the mess ends up being too much, why not also get your siblings to help out more and try incentives (extra pocket money, treat, etc) in return? \n\nAll in all, YTA", "ESH. I am sorry to have to say that. I have three kids myself so I get being exhausted after working. That doesn\u2019t mean you get to abdicate your responsibility to the child you created and brought into the world.

He isn\u2019t their baby. He\u2019s yours. You need to step up and be his mom. Children, especially toddlers, need routine in their lives and it sounds like his schedule and routine and just daily life is all over the place. There is no reason he should be in bed still at 11am. There is no reason he should be staying up all night and going to bed at potentially 6am. There is no reason he should not be getting bathed at least every other day, including getting his hair washed. Some kids hate baths and getting washed. It\u2019s normal. It still has to happen. Try teaching him how to tilt his head back so water and soap don\u2019t fall into his eyes as you bathe him, and like others have said, it doesn\u2019t HAVE to be nightly. It could be something you do in the morning when you both wake up. Make it a fun bonding time with you two. Get some bath toys and let him spend 10 minutes just playing with you and making up silly stories and situations with the bath toys. Remind him he has to be washed to stay healthy, and as his mom, you want him to be healthy because you love him. I get that your mental health isn\u2019t the best but you may find that by starting this routine with him, you\u2019ll start to feel better. I had bad postpartum depression with my first child. I felt like I couldn\u2019t do anything right and that he was clearly going to turn out awful because I was the worst parent ever. That wasn\u2019t true and he\u2019s a super well adjusted kid now and I love him and my other children more than I could ever adequately express. But I had to let go of the feelings of inadequacy and do what was best for him and for my other children, too.

Don\u2019t let your mom and grandma berate you for trying your best for your kid, but make sure you actually ARE trying your best for your kid. You are his mom and he loves you but he needs you to set the boundaries, set the schedule, and make sure other caregivers know what they are and that they support it.

Now that I live with my fiance, we are both adults and try to pick up after ourselves. This distribution of labor is abusive.\n\nKick the bf out. He seems useless and is a leech.\n\nTry to get your kiddo onto a consistent sleep schedule and then enroll into pre-K. Your family is doing him no favors. \n\nAlso it could behoove you to look into WFH jobs if you can. Leaves more time for you in the day and it can help you get your son into a consistent schedule.\n\nLastly, move out. Ignore anything your family says to make you not do so.

This isn\u2019t normal, this is not the way healthy people live. For your sake and the sake of your child you need to get out. I know you love your son and want to do right by him.

You said he's asleep at 11am when you leave but now are saying he's asleep at 8pm. He sleeps 15 hours a day?! There are so many issues here and the main is that your kid needs to be on an actual schedule that fits your work hours so that you have time to be with him, feed him and bathe him. You're relying on people you shouldn't and then throwing your hands up like it's unfixable. Why is your grandma telling you what to do with your child at all? You need to move out.", "My brother was also the same way with hair washing and he has autism. Same with my godson now, but this is mostly when he was feeling particular overstimulated.

You need to step up and be a parent to your child before someone outside of your household finds out what\u2019s going on and gets CPS involved.
