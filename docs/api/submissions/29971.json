At the time I said her baby would be welcome but dependent upon what we plan. Her baby will be 6mths old at the time of the wedding. My other friend attending has a baby 3 weeks older and is leaving him home, whilst my sister in law is bringing our 18 mth old nephew to the ceremony and he is then leaving thereafter (both their choices prior to me booking the below.)\nAs of earlier this month, we booked an afternoon tea bus to take us from Marylebone to our dinner venue, unfortunately they have a policy of over 2's on board, I let my friend know as soon as I had booked and paid that unfortunately her baby would only be able to attend the ceremony and will thereafter need to be collected, which she was absolutely fine with. Fast forward 3 weeks she has been saying she's left it up to her husband to sort childcare, they have a stable family network near them whilst her family are based in Lincoln, her MIL will be working on the Friday and they are not willing to ask for her help. She asked if the baby could attend and her husband (also my husband to be's best friend) will take a cab to the venue whilst we drive around London for 90 mins, I said this wasn't feasible as I had factored them into the cost of the bus and we cannot enter the venue until 5:30pm. This sparked her to say that 'if I'm too stressed about it they won't attend and I can replace them' obviously not something I would want to do. After a lot of back and forth, asking what parts the baby 'is and isn't welcome at' she said she will try and sort it, she has since come back and said the baby will come to the ceremony but if they can't find someone she won't attend at all.

The cost to you of the bus doesn't change whether they are on it or not. You're N T A if you don't want the baby at the reception, but just say so, instead of going through all these complicated explanations that make it someone else's responsibility. You said at the outset that you didn't want babies there, and then you've amended that as you've gone. I can understand why your friend is confused. Just tell her she needs to organize child care. \nNAH, just very poor communication on your part and a friend who is trying to make arrangements.", "NAH you don't need babies at your wedding. and she doesn't NEED to be there if it is going to cause too much of a problem. If she is saying to replace her it seems like her and her husband won't be insulted.", "If the baby is only not welcome on the bus, I really don\u2019t understand what the issue is if the husband is willing to look after the child off the bus for a little bit.  The price of including them both in the bus is not ideal, but you will pay that money anyway, so it is a sunk cost.  Given that it\u2019s an afternoon tea bus for just about two hours and nobody is upset about the baby being absent during that time, I am having a really hard time understanding why this small portion of an entire day presents a problem. \n\nAs well as the fact that they seem to be fine sorting out this issue either way.  But what they really seem to want is clarity from you so they can figure out how to actually sort this (hence the request about when the baby is/is not welcome). And you seem to be extremely unclear (even in this post, it is very much unclear, and you are a bit all over the place). So not TA for not wanting the baby there, but soft YTA for being so fickle and not giving a definitive answer.  Take a stand and stick with it so they can start planning now.", "YTA. Not maliciously so, but it sounds like you don\u2019t understand the logistics of babies. You aren\u2019t the AH for wanting a child free wedding, but you are for giving her any grief over not coming to any or all parts of the wedding. \n\nBabies happen when they happen, and you can\u2019t always conveniently time them around wedding season. Understand that she can\u2019t just not take care of her baby. You told her babies were welcome depending on plans, then now are telling her the baby is welcome but only for part of the wedding. Childcare plans fall through, it happens. She can\u2019t go on the bus with the baby, she has no one to take care of the baby but her husband, and now the husband has to be on the bus too? Like does it not move if he\u2019s not in it? It\u2019s annoying, but you can pay for his spot even if he\u2019s not there. \n\nHer presence is either important enough for you to accommodate, or it isn\u2019t. If it isn\u2019t, then don\u2019t be upset when she doesn\u2019t come. It\u2019s not a reflection on your friendship, it\u2019s just the reality that you can\u2019t accommodate everyone on a day entirely about you and she has a lot of obligations as the parent of a young child.", "NAH. You are not an asshole but if they can't find a babysitter it is good of them to decide what to do and what they have decided is not come to the wedding and take care of their child by themselves. That is also understandable.", "you may not be the AH but your friend is trying hard to make it work and yes it is stressful to find childcare so if she can't find anything then it is not her fault . It doesn't sound as if she is mad at you , it's just that she can't do anything about it . That's life as parents.", "Well, if it's a rule of this bus you're on, there's not much you can do, right? \nShe tries to attend, but I can understand, that she doesn't want to leave the baby. It's still really young and definitely your friend's priority at the moment. \n\nYou're NTA for not wanting babies at your wedding. It's your day and your rules, but at the same time, you can't expect her to leave the baby...", "She's one of the bride's maids. Husbands is my fiance best mate and a groomsman", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not an Ah, but you will have to accept that some will not come.", "NTA.   It's your day.  It's all about you.  \n\nI don't think babies should attend weddings.", "Nta.   It's your wedding. You can decide who can come and who can't. \n\n\nBut. Ywbta, if you get mad or complain if she doesn't come.", "YTA\n\nof course you are, you have friends with very young babies and you are making it difficult for them. You will end up with less friends if you keep going like this.", "Nta over any wedding planning but it\u2019s clear your friend is trying to make it work. If she\u2019s unable to find childcare then she can\u2019t find childcare and you can\u2019t fault her for that. Baby is 6 months and young, and her priority is caring for her baby. \n\nBut it is your day, and your decision. It\u2019s also a rule for the bus and you can\u2019t do much about that, and also knew the rules when you booked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They have given you plenty of notice to replace them buy you are aching like they cannot drop out. Yta", "Babies, and also toddlers. Weddings are events designated for adults and, unless they are very family friendly, they don't have spaces for children. \n\nI can't imagine a more boring situation for a child and I don't blame them if they cry or throw a tantrum.", "Wedding was booked before they fell pregnant. It's gone from 130 to 35 people as we include them as they are 35 nearest and dearest. We have given them over a years notice - save the dates went out in early 2022.", "Changed the rules or upped the experience for the other 33 guests?", "I\u2019ve made it work with my young baby and child free weddings, but it\u2019s incredibly hard and has cost me an insane amount of money.

You are TA for expecting them to sort it because you sorted it in the past. They are under no obligation to attend. I wouldn't after you change the rules and blame the bus. They've tried to find solutions and you are unwilling to compromise but insist on them being there. The only thing you have a right to insist is whether you will welcome children or not. You can't insist they attend because they are such good friends they made the cut from 130 to 35. Accept that they probably won't be there and that you have probably soured a close friendship over nonesense and emotional blackmail.", "You found magical childcare that never cancels or gets your kid sick so you never have to miss work or an event! Please, send them my way.", "Interesting take and I appreciate your honesty. The only issue I can see is that they haven't actually asked anyone for help. You could argue that they are using the baby as emotional blackmail on us to force our hand and let them come. It's also not about them, it's about us. She's also left it up to him to ask for help and he won't ask his parents or siblings for help with childcare. That's not a solution.", "They are not \"using the baby as emotional blackmail\". They have a baby that you had agreed to allow and blame the bus for no longer allowing. It's obvious that you are using the bus as an excuse, which likely hurt their feelings knowing you are not being honest and forthcoming. They did find a solution, just not the solution you want. You want them to find the solution YOU want.\nAs I've said you have the right to say no children but you do not have the right to expect everyone to be ok or attend. YTA for changing the rules and expecting them to find the solution you want. They are under no obligation to ask someone else to take a day off work for your wedding.", "It isn\u2019t emotional blackmail. They\u2019ve told you they\u2019re fine being replaced. You aren\u2019t obligated to include their child but they\u2019re also not obligated to attend something that doesn\u2019t work for them."]}
