You already said they couldnt stay. They are not listening. Why would the drugs or stealing come up if they have never dabbled in either? You know what I would do? Pay for the hotel, but keep them out of your house. They are unhealthy people. Paying for a $60/night hotel (they can share a double room) is the best money you can spend.
