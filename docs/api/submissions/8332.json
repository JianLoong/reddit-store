And in what Twilight Zone universe should you have to pay the phone bills for a household that is bringing in $9,000 a freaking month?!?!  You should shut that crap down immediately, as well as all the other mooching that is going on.  I'd be inclined to make an exception for urgent vet issues (only if paid directly to the vet) simply because I love animals and would do most anything to help one.
