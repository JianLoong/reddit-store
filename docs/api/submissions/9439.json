She was shocked and refused to do so saying it was cold. I had to get out of the car and pull her out. Then I drove off. My family is furious with me for leaving her there.

Your grandma is an asshole for being a narrow-minded person who wants to enforce her views on others who aren't harming anyone.\n\nYou're an asshole for leaving her to fend for herself.  Were your ears bleeding from listening to her? If not, you could've let her rant and just not engage in the conversation.", "YTA. You should have cut the excursion short and simply driven her home.

Let alone in inhosptable weather.", "I literally had this exact scenario play out with my grandmother a few weeks ago. I told her I wasn\u2019t talking about it, every time she tried to continue I just shut it down, and I dropped her off at her house. She\u2019s 88.

You should be ashamed of yourself. \n\nShes 88. She comes from a different time. While her actions and I\u2019m sure what she said was terrible; you shouldn\u2019t have left her in a parking lot. You ABSOLUTELY should not have physically assaulted her to get her out of your car. Your reaction to this is nor proportionate to the situation. \n\nYour family is right, they aren\u2019t being hyperbolic. She could have easily died. You owe her a major apology. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t call the cops and report you for assault and abandonment and get adult protective services involved. \n\nSenior citizens go back to being children as they age.

The elderly have far less tolerance to poor weather conditions than younger people, your grandmother could very easily have ended up with pneumonia after that. If you think your family is angry at you now, just imagine what they would be like if she had ended up in the hospital or even worse. As a healthy adult, you had a duty of care to ensure your grandmother's safety. That means you should have taken her home, to a relative's house or at the very least somewhere warm and safe.

Either is fine, you're entitled to your choices.\n\nBut don't abandon them in a parking lot.

Yeah, she's a hot mess, but leaving her stranded? Come on.\n\nESH.\n\nGood on you for not tolerating bullshyte. Next time just take her home and refuse to talk. If there is a next time.", "YTA. Seek help.\n\nThis post shook me, because I take care of my 90 year old grandparents, just went inside to hug my 89 year grandma after reading this.\n\nShe's 89 years old, of course her social/political views are fucked.", "Could you not have removed yourself from the situation, rather than getting physical?

To pull over and drag someone out of your car and leave them there - especially someone that\u2019s not any danger to you and is 88 years old\u2026 that\u2019s appalling and disgusting behaviour.

That is easier to manage when you are younger and being raised with the new language and are participating in that change. Once, you get older that is infinitely more difficult. Your brain has been formed for decades and unless you are more actives participating in the daily change as the younger generations are, this change is scary and can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. I think maybe an older reader can understand how an 88 yo may have trouble understanding this change. They are scared and have a hard time understanding that these rules they were taught are being turned on their head. This is discombobulating. I think readers are giving 88 yo grandma grace.
