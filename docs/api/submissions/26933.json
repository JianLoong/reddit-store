We both have Fibromyalgia, except she gets disability for it and has never worked a day in her life. I have not tried to apply for disability, as I want to work until I can't. She won't even work an office desk job and plays up her disability to anyone who will listen. She also has government housing, and discounted utility bills. She uses WIC and EBT. I have seen her do very physical tasks, so I know if she wanted to, she could. \n\nI was talking to her the other day about how I couldn't help her with her light bill this time because I was running dry on my own money, and she got upset saying \"I don't understand.how you work so much but never have any money, I'm able to afford rent and food and I have a child but you don't even have a child, so where is your money going? I think you just are overspending. If I'm able to make it work, you should be too.\" So I blew up on her and told her \"the only reason you're able to \"make it work\" is because everyone carries your ass. You're on government assistance for everything, you are capable of working but won't, and you have me and other people in the family pay for the bills you \"can't afford\". How many times have I paid your phone bill? Your electric? How about water? Or putting gas in your car? You do practically nothing to improve your life you just bitch about money until someone gives in and gives it to you.\" She got angry and said she was just trying to help because clearly I'm not managing my money right or I'd have enough, and I said \"you're only concerned about me having enough so I can support your lazy ass\". And she told me to leave. Everyone else said I was being too harsh, but I think it was justified because how is she going to criticize me about my money when she doesn't even do anything for her own money?", "created_utc": 1694807950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jn6jd/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_the_only_reason_shes/", "score": 8316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ironic how she's claiming to 'make it work' while asking you to pay her bills", "NTA. \n\nEvery fibro case is different, and some days are better than others, so judging her level against yours is not resonable. But you are completely justified in your reaction to being verbally berated by someone asking you for money on how you need to be better with money. \n\nShe is being enabled by all of your family. Step away and give her 1 less enabler. You need to save and prepare for when you can't work anymore. \n\nDo not feel bad. She shouldn't dish it if she can't receive it.", "So justified that it has to be NTA. \n\nIf she's able to raise a three year old daughter without at-home assistance, she cannot be so wracked by fibro that there are no jobs she can do. It definitely causes things like pain and exhaustion, but yeah, that. \n\nAnd what she said was extremely entitled and insulting.", ">I have not tried to apply for disability, as I want to work until I can't. She won't even work an office desk job and plays up her disability to anyone who will listen. She also has government housing, and discounted utility bills. She uses WIC and EBT.\n\nYou can work on disability, there's a set limit on how much income you can earn and still get disability assistance. And there is no shame is getting assistance to help work as long as you can.\n\nSince you haven't tried to apply, you might not be aware of how difficult it is to get approved. If she's eligible for all of these programs, there's more justification to her limitations than you might be privy to. \n\nThat being said, her attitude, behavior, and judgemental condescending remarks are not justifiable.\n\nIt might be beneficial for you to get the disability approval process going for you. Justifying your disability is the hardest and longest part of the process. Benefits can come into play later on but this way you have resources lined up when you need them. Fibromyalgia is no joke and that level of exhaustion, not to mention the other conditions that may accompany it, are quite a challenge to navigate even on a good day. \n\nWishing you days with energy and strength.", "ESH - Look she's in the wrong for being an AH when asking you for money but also you don't get to go she's lazy for not working until her body craps out. You complain that she doesn't work but has the energy to lift something when it's something she wants but that's what being chronically ill means and she doesn't need to prove to you that she is disabled 'enough' to justify not working. Doing a fun task once off is a lot less work than a day in day out job that would involve constant activity. \n\nYou're not lazy for pushing yourself to your absolute max just because our society tells us we don't have value unless we contribute. I pushed myself for years and never gave myself the rest my body was screaming for and it destroyed me mentally and physically.\n\nShe sucks for obvious reasons but you don't get to be ableist just because you also have Fibromyalgia", "Everyone here sucks.  Judging someone for being on assistance sucks.  Stop doing that.  Criticizing your finances sucks.  She shouldn\u2019t do that.", "ESH", "ESH. Your cousin's an ass for criticizing you about how you use YOUR money. It's not your responsibility to pay her bills for her. You, however, seem extremely contemptuous of your cousin for making use of the resources that she's entitled to as a person with a disability. Just because you take pride in your independence from the government does not mean that she is worth less or worthy of less respect than you.\n\nI in no way intend to speak down to you about your own disability, but even you acknowledge that the experience is different for everybody. Although your cousin may be able to gather the mental and physical resources required to do certain tasks that you deem to be proof that she's less disabled than she claims, that does not mean she is exaggerating her pain levels nor her disability. A lot of us have extremely limited resources, and it is not a flaw that your cousin reserves hers for things she truly enjoys.\n\nFrankly, your budgets aren't one another's business. If you completely separate your finances, your relationship will likely be a lot better - but there's more than financial disagreements at play here, and the two of you need to figure out how to stop judging one another so harshly.  \n\n\nEDIT: I wrote sister at first. I meant cousin. Oops.", "ESH. Disability is incredibly difficult to get. I have a hard time believing that she\u2019s not actually disabled when the hoops you have jump through are so extensive. She\u2019s obviously TA for asking for money and trying to get you money advice when she\u2019s on government assistance. \n\nI\u2019m only saying ESH because you\u2019re assuming your disability is equal to hers when it could very well be worse.", "NTA - Was leaning the other way at the end of the 1st paragraph, but her response made me do a quick 180. She clearly isn't making it work off the government if she still needs your assistance. She also needs to learn about rocks and glass houses.", "ESH - Yeah obviously she sucks because how tf does she tell you that you are irresponsible with your money whilst asking for your money???\n\nBut also I think it is ableist to judge her on her disability. Just because your disability doesn't disable you as much, doesn't mean hers is the same.", "ESH, I know so many people with FM or some other disability who have been and still are trying to get assistance. The government is stingy with it, if your cousin managed it there must be a pretty good reason. Living off of disability isn't something to be shamed, like you did.\n\nHowever your cousins also needs to butt outta your shit.", "ESH\n\nJust because someone does a physically demanding task in the moment doesn't mean they aren't paying for it sometimes several days to weeks later. Work on your internalized ableism.\n\nThat said every word out her mouth about your financial situation was dismissive and beyond rude. She does need reminded her cost of living is regulated.", "ESH.  I have fibromyalgia too, and the bad days are fucking BAD.  I work, but it\u2019s hard.  I give up most of my functional hours to my employer and don\u2019t get to spend much time enjoying my own life.  I certainly don\u2019t judge anyone for needing assistance.  And neither should you.\n\nShe should not cast stones about money management when she constantly has to ask her family to help with bills.  Not entirely her fault- government assistance is barely enough to keep anyone going.  But still, she doesn\u2019t have room to judge your monetary situation.", "ESH. Your first paragraph makes you sound a little jealous- if you want assistance, apply for it. If she gets it, she probably needs it. I get WIC and immediately qualify because of the type of health insurance my kids have. I still work (and also have a chronic illness). \n\nObviously, her questioning your spending habits isn't appropriate, but you could have just said no and moved on.", "NTA. But stop paying her bills. For ever. Also look into if you can get your fibro on paper before you feel its starts to cut into your work. If its properly documented, it will be easier to go into part time work with government help when you do need it.", "IMO 50/50; you might be NTA but you're still not completely in the right. Firstly, things affect different people differently. After a quick research I even found the symptoms for women can be more severe after childbirth (but could be wrong!). Also she has to raise a child and (assuming she does 50-70% of that and the household alone) that costs a lot of energy. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the system of having 'spoons' per day, but she might have way less spoons to spend per day than you :/ honestly I get you, it's not your responsibility to pay for her things if she gets money and all.. but her having as much support as possible is great and actually a huge privilege, please don't make her feel bad about it even tho she might seem lazy to you.\n\n(Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language)", "Absolutely NOT the AH. Wtf. A grown adult with a child and no job, relying on the governments money, telling you what to do with your money? Cut her out of your life and stop helping her pay her bills. Some people just have to learn the hard way.", "ESH you're an asshole for blaming her about getting government assistance. If she qualifies and receives it, then there's nothing to complain about. Her journey with her disability is different from your own. You may see her on the good days and think she's fine, and not see her on the bad days. I'm not fully aware of gov't benefits, but is there some way to go on partial disability to get some financial assistance while remaining working? If you can't make ends meet, there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting government help. Shaming people for governemnt assistance is wrong. \n\nShe sucks though for depending on you though. it's hypocritical to ask someone if they can help you budget because you can't afford to take care of them.\n\nThis relationship is toxic and needs cutting off or changing. You're becoming bitter and angry because of it.", "Nta.  Omg, she's chiding you for not managing your money well WHILE ASKING YOU FOR MONEY?  The audacity.  She's entitled and also not so bright.", "ESH. Yeah, she is definitely a leech on family and it was pretty entitled to say that to you. But the way you talk about your choice to work instead of applying for government assistance is gross. It doesn't make you better than other sick people because you work and they don't. Your cousin needs to stop acting like it's everyone else's responsibility to financially support her, but you need to get off your high horse and stop trash talking her for using the tools available to her.", "NTA. Why are you helping with her bills?", "You don't know what your future is.. Cut off the adult toddler and start salting some of that cash away for your rainy day", "NTA - everybody should get government assistance for disability but if other people are paying for her expenses then cousin has no standing to give financial advice to other people or berate them for their spending.", "Wait wait wait wait wait\u2026\u2026\u2026.she judged you for not having money while\u2026\u2026..asking you for money?????????? \n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA.

I'm very sick on top of my fibromyalgia. I need TPN every night or I won't live. They would take that all away if I married the man I love or volunteered. It's sick.

We both have Fibromyalgia, except she gets disability for it and has never worked a day in her life. I have not tried to apply for disability, as I want to work until I can't. She won't even work an office desk job and plays up her disability to anyone who will listen. She also has government housing, and discounted utility bills. She uses WIC and EBT. I have seen her do very physical tasks, so I know if she wanted to, she could. \n\nI was talking to her the other day about how I couldn't help her with her light bill this time because I was running dry on my own money, and she got upset saying \"I don't understand.how you work so much but never have any money, I'm able to afford rent and food and I have a child but you don't even have a child, so where is your money going? I think you just are overspending. If I'm able to make it work, you should be too.\" So I blew up on her and told her \"the only reason you're able to \"make it work\" is because everyone carries your ass. You're on government assistance for everything, you are capable of working but won't, and you have me and other people in the family pay for the bills you \"can't afford\". How many times have I paid your phone bill? Your electric? How about water? Or putting gas in your car? You do practically nothing to improve your life you just bitch about money until someone gives in and gives it to you.\" She got angry and said she was just trying to help because clearly I'm not managing my money right or I'd have enough, and I said \"you're only concerned about me having enough so I can support your lazy ass\". And she told me to leave. Everyone else said I was being too harsh, but I think it was justified because how is she going to criticize me about my money when she doesn't even do anything for her own money?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't see any conceivable reality where you could be anything but NTA.\n\nIt definitely sounds like she is perfectly happy to coast through life on everyone else's assistance. And I get that all disabilities are different. I'm disabled as well, not fibro, but still the kind that needs a constant pain control regimen. However, I can definitely say there is no way I would be able to raise even one of my kids on my own. Especially not when they were 3 years old. Fortunately, the work I do pays well and is much more within my abilities compared to raising a child alone. So it's hard for me to fathom how she thinks she can't do ANY sort of work.", "NTA.

Of course she\u2019s happy not working. But she can fuck right off asking for help from a person who also suffers from chronic illnesses", "This. OP's anger at her using government assistance is misdirected, and if OP ever needed disability nobody should judge them for it. Disabled people have every right to basic care and housing and food as anyone else does. \n\nThat being said, OP has every right to be mad at this cousin. They were way out of line and deserved to be hit below the belt.", "That's what I said. I know it affects everyone differently, but it's not as bad as she makes it out to be.

You can qualify for disability and be able to do some things still. It's more about if you would get fired for missing work and if you can KEEP your job but also if you would need job training to even get the jobs and if you are capable of getting the training.\n\n\nSo it's not really simple enough to say someone should definitely be able to work from reading a story, they might still qualify fully for disability legally\n\n\nI was raised by someone with fibro and I developed it myself. She was always neglectful to my emotions and needs. I never got to go spend time out of the house unless we were running errands. She never really tried to make special memories with me. I don't even want to have kids of my own because my exhaustion is so terrible and I barely can take care of myself at a functioning level on bad days.\n\n\nSome parents with disabilities are amazing and learn to accommodate their needs without neglecting their kids. Some insist on having children and aren't able to give them what they need.\n\n\nAlso a lot of working people technically qualify for disability but they make the process so traumatizing and confusing that a lot of people can't handle it and what they give out isn't even enough for a 1 bedroom apartment in a lot of states", "I think these kind of equivalents are really u helpful. Someone can be disabled in a way that they are unable to work but that they are able to raise children. Or that they can do some activities on some days and can\u2019t on others.

She's likely not capable of both working and raising her three year old.  For chronic illnesses, physical and mental, there is only so much energy available in a day and you have to prioritize.

It is easier to manage at home where there aren't the same expectations most jobs have.\n\nOP is still NTA and the cousin is awfully entitled for criticizing OP for their handling of money when OP couldn't help.", "YTA for this comment. How would she be able to raise a child AND work with fibro? That\u2019s two jobs. That\u2019s absurd", "Nup, ETA. She has no right to demand money, but OP has no right to judge her ability to work, expect her to work with a disability AND a toddler to take care of, and judge her for accepting family help. Raising a toddler as a single mum on a meagre disability pension is a challenge, mentally and financially, and there is nothing wrong with accepting help from family if they are willing to give it.

HOWEVER, what people wouldn't see- is how that would put me out in pain and fatigue for the next week. I did it because I weighed the pros vs cons and thought, yup I'm okay with being in pain for the next week so I can have a nice half hour or hour with my nieces. \n\nI could do this on special occasions, but if I were to just push through like this on a regular basis I would be OUT (and I *was* out when I did try to do this at first.

Not necessarily, but should that ever happen you may find yourself in the position of needing disability", "Agree, ESH. From what I have heard, getting on disability is not easy at all.

The department determined that he was no longer able to fulfill his duties as an officer and told him to go out on disability. He fought and fought to get reinstated, but the department wouldn't do it. So, he grudgingly applied for SSDI. He was denied because they determined he wasn't disabled. He tried to use their rejection to get back on the force. \n\nIt went a few more rounds, but eventually he got his SSDI, did not get to go back to the force, but did go to school to get a higher degree.", "And total lack of work history, per OP. SSDI typically requires a certain number of \u201cquarters\u201d paying into the system to qualify for it at all.", "SNAP calculations are meant to specifically avoid this. If you couldn't pay for it after losing SNAP because you're spending all your money on good, you couldn't hav Ed paid for it at the lower income but with SNAP. The only exception is health care costs (as those aren't evenly distributed). It's been 30 years since increasing income lead to net negatives. There were a bunch of reforms to fix it for exactly this reason.", "It\u2019s difficult or impossible to just collect some benefits and maintain a decent job, so people with \u201cminor\u201d disabilities are forced to pick between overworking themselves and not working at all. Sure, people suck, but the system doesn\u2019t make it easy for anyone.", "That, plus elite emotional manipulation skills allowing her to squeeze money out of everyone she wants\u2026 she should really consider a career in sales", "she better report that job to the disability office.", "Not if she has an income. Even an incime as low as $2k a month will only get $40 or so. It varies by state.", "Except she was bragging about how she was making ends meet, and therefore better than her cousin she was demanding money from, so", "but as OP states, she also lives in government housing, gets utility assistance, WIC/EBT, etc. It\u2019s not just the $1358 from disability she\u2019s receiving every month. absolutely no reason she should be begging from her family.", "I\u2019m glad someone said it. There\u2019s no way this is the whole truth if she\u2019s really \u201cnever worked a day in her life\u201d. SSI is shit and the wait lists for housing are endless; also, every state I am aware of has some kind of lifetime limit for how long one can be receiving EBT. \n\nAt best ESH, for the ableism alone. Cousin is still an AH but I don\u2019t think OP is much less of one here.", "Never should have been in the first place ...", "Thank you for mentioning the spoons thing lmao. I could never really articulate why I hate it so much. It was sent to me years ago by an able bodied friend, since then it's become part of his and his friends vocabulary, but it annoys me every time because it just feels idk patronizing? Like you can't understand and believe what a disabled person says unless there's some cutesy term for it. I am not the only disabled person in my friend group but only the able bodied people use this term to refer to themselves lol.", "I was about to point this out, plus if she's working, what about childcare? That shit isn't cheap.\n\nHer attitude is still stinky but I absolutely do not fault her for not working.", "There\u2019s also the incredibly likely chance that if she were to get a job, they would pull her disability benefits. At least, they would be severely cut", "Sure but she also shouldn't be being sanctimonious to the people paying her bills for her. Particularly not when OP is using all of *her* energy to work, which is why the cousin can then scab off of her.\n\nJust because she has a condition doesn't mean she isn't a gaping asshole.", "Internalized ableism abound", "Yes, and you have to wait 2 full years for Medicare to even start once you get SSDI approval, and it's easy to be over the Medicaid limit. And now if you aren't pretty well off, you get forced into the private HMO Medicare plans (Part C) which have some big drawbacks but less upfront out-of-pocket costs. It's not great.", "What? How are you meant to get disability if you've been disabled previously, and never been able to work?", "And OP and the cousin are BOTH feeling awfully superior over each other, one for being able to get her and her kid's financial needs met through whatever means are available (if they are in the US, getting disability benefits is SO F-ING HARD) and the other for not asking for assistance from anyone (it is also SO HARD to ask for help). Neither one is morally superior and both are behaving like jerks to each other. ESH", "Everyone acting in their best interest is called Objectivism, and Ayn Rand was wrong when she proposed it.", "Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "TBH I don't think it's people like OPs cousin who make others judgmental, it's folks like OP who \"work through the pain\", say that they can do it so another person with their illness is capable (in ops eyes) of working, and call disabled people greedy. Many disabilities are invisible and a social worker isn't really qualified to judge, which is why our doctors fill reports. \n\nNow don't get me wrong - OPs cousin is being an entitled jerk, even if she's stressed about the situation, she has no right to someone elses money. But OPs attitude about her illness and work ethic are totally separate. Like you said it's an enormous uphill battle for people to get benefits in the first place. If people with legit doctors on their side struggle that much, do you really think there's THAT many fakers who can get through that net? It's just a political talking point from people who don't want to fund these benefits, that riles people up so it seems like everyone is taking advantage when it's actually not that big of an issue. Most places also don't pay enough for disability to even live comfortably, and penalize you for working on the side, it's not a glamorous life. \n\nWhich is to say, as someone who might soon be on the system, you should try to change how you see/talk about it. \"I know people take advantage, I'm one of the good ones\" doesn't shake suspicion off you nearly as well as \"Let me explain why this issue is exaggerated\" will. It doesn't help with the shame either. Some people won't listen either way, screw them. You didn't ask to be born or to be sick, you deserve basic quality of life. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. I also had a deep sense of shame when I realized I would need to get government assistance. I was a hard worker, I had saved 10k in my early 20s and was a few months off from finishing a contract which would lock me into a great career. I pissed away that entire savings on overpriced medicine before accepting that I needed help, and even then I only went on welfare rather than disability just for the medical costs. I was very lucky to have a social worker who pushed me towards more support and told me to take care of myself. You know you don't intend to take advantage, so just accept the help you and your loved ones have been paying taxes toward, if you end up recovering you can get off disability and make a nice donation somewhere. Don't let fear of judgement drag you down into a worse situation or suffer more than you have to. Good luck!", "I mean yeah I'm not saying she's not an ah, just that it makes sense she needs extra help when she's solely dependent on government assistance.", "Yeah, she's a bad person. That doesn't change the facts.", "If cuz is so good at money management, maybe OP should not only stop paying her bills, but even, next time OP has an unexpected bill, they should call up cuz and tell her that she needs help from the financial genius, as she\u2019s clearly better at managing money and should have funds to help OP out this time, because that\u2019s what family does, isn\u2019t it? NTA", "NTA\n\n> Everyone else said I was being too harsh\n\nWithdraw your support forever. When everyone else ends up carrying her without your contribution, they'll begin to understand.\n\nAlso,\n\n> she's demanding ~~payments~~\n\n*tribute*", "Depends on the area. I pay one bill for electricity & another one for natural gas. In some areas one company delivers both electricity & natural gas & the customer only pays one bill.  In some rural areas the homeowner has a big tank out back & a truck comes periodically and fills it with propane which is used mainly for heating. Some people still use an oil fired furnace for which fuel has to be delivered by truck. One acquaintance of mine in rural Texas has electricity, but the house is heated with a wood fired pot bellied stove.", "If you haven\u2019t, get a lawyer.", "I have it, and have been incredibly lucky in that I got in a drug study for treatment using pyridostigmine bromide, and even luckier that I was a laborer before I got it (and am male), so the PB was really effective.\n\nJust a few flare ups in the last  couple decades, otherwise a pretty normal life.\n\nThat said, I have met people who are very much like OPs cousin. I don\u2019t judge them for it, because I don\u2019t know how it is for them, but they shouldn\u2019t be offering advice on finances while begging, either.", "So many able bodies people have literally zero clue how disabilities or chronic illnesses/injuries work. If I *really* need to, I can muster up enough strength and energy to get something done. But then I pay for it for weeks. When we last moved, I had to take two days off of work and could barely keep my eyes open for the following two weeks. It just took so much out of me. So sure, I can go do that labour intensive job....for a day and then be dead by the next day. I can only do things like working out because it's small, short bursts of energy. I can scale the difficulty to how I'm feeling that day, if I skip a day, I don't go hungry or homeless and it's all by my choice. Completely different from a job.", "Yeah it reminds me of those people who complain about folks who can't pay rent but ate avocado toast two weeks ago", "I don't think I've really seen anyone be lazy, I DO see a lot of undiagnosed disabilities and folks just left ill equipped and boggled by the system.\n\nHeck kids who would be diagnosed as dyslexic or on the spectrum or ADHD now, when I was a kid were waved off as \"lazy/dumb/bad\" ... \n\nYou never really know what anyone is struggling with, and *they* might not know what extra weight they are carrying.", "You mean it's not an auto renew subscription?", "A lot of people these days have dropped that subscription.", "Same. I was diagnosed at 21-22. I\u2019ve got four kids, single parent, lucky enough to have a decent paying flexible office/wfh job. In my personal situation disability doesn\u2019t cover the cost to live alone, and certainly not enough to have a family on given that was never the intent. Being diagnosed with an illness that\u2019s inherently not disabling to the traditional sense of wheelchair or bed bound forever is so hard to deal with. Even once we can get past the doubt, shaming, accusations, and the general bad stigma this diagnosis now has, it\u2019s still as though life is teasing you with energy for anything one day and then weeks of feeling run down and unable to even wear the shirt you wanted to because it hurts too much. \n\nStill, being in a bad way does not excuse shitty attitudes or false sense of entitlement towards anyone.", "So fucking right.\n\nThey also have zero clue how these public assistance programs work. They probably didn't even know that the most you can get from SSI is $914/month, and that you usually get less than the $914.

Hydro implies it's generated from a dam.\n\nIt's also called Hydro in New Brunswick and BC. \n\nThe power companies in Manitoba and BC are called Manitoba Hydro and BC Hydro.", "I have never, ever had combined gas and electric, and I have payed power bills in NY (upstate) CT, WA and OR.

Otherwise, I have found I am better off not bringing it up.", "We have a water bill and a hydro bill. Water pays for water and hydro pays for electricity, called hydro because much of Ontario uses hydroelectric generated electricity.", "Here in New Zealand it's the power bill as well."]}
