Your FMIL is not going anywhere and you will not be happy in this relationship. Break up, disentangle, and block. \n\nIn the meantime, I don't remember genders, but if there is the possibility of pregnancy, make sure you take control of your own birth control and don't trust that your partner will.", "NTA. Living with family rarely ever works out. You're allowed to change your mind when something like this is sprung on you. You would never be home alone. And you should not be responsible for their poor life decisions. This does not make you a bad person.\n\nEdit to add: I left a marriage for something similar. Ex and brother lived together when we met and dated. I moved in. Ex asked me to marry him. I said yes. But brother has to move out in a year. Didn't happen. All kinds of excuses why. Then ex started pressuring me for kids. No way in Hades until bro is out. He never made bro move. So I filed for divorce.", "NTA\n\nRe-evaluate the relationship or at least postpone any discussions of getting married, if you\u2019re this uncomfortable with the idea of living with your FMIL post marriage then it sounds like going through with it would be tremendous mistake, that will only fester in resentment later.", "You're not an ah, but I genuinely think that your values don't align and thus you should really evaluate your relationship. Sit down and have an honest conversation with girlfriend and see if there's an act of future for you guys someday.", "NTA\n\nI cannot imagine wanting to live with a mother in law, especially at the beginning of a marriage.  Your desires are important too.  \n\nIt concerns me that moving in together would help her, but not you necessarily.  It's natural to want to help the person you love, but frankly this does not look like it would end well.  Unless MIL is a wonderful person whose company you enjoy.", "NTA, I am the sole caregiver for my elderly mother.  Getting old is expensive.  You will have to have a home that is accessible for her and her needs.  You will not have any privacy in your own home.    Will she be going on every dinner out with your, every vacation.  What happens when you have kids, will there be room in the house for everyone.  What happens when dad gets out of prison.  Will mom and daughter expect him to move in as well.  Get out of this relationship ASAP.", "NTA but it sounds like your options are stay with your girlfriend and accept that herr mom will be your burden for the remainder of her life, or walk away. Her mom is still relatively young, and unless she has some kind of medical issue preventing her from working, she should be paying her own way. You're young and presumably want to spend your money on your own needs, your own little family, and we're talking potentially *decades* of you having to take care of her mom? Sorry, but no.", "NTA. \n\nMoving in with someone, spending your life with someone, marrying someone, these are all big decisions and just that you're not automatically jumping into it is a good thing. \n\nI've seen some things, so in my case, I wouldn't move in together unless it was crystal clear that ONLY your GF moves in with you. \n\nThen I'd still keep separate finances to ensure that there's no damn way YOU foot the bill for MIL - but if your house has room, it's still a good chance she'll move in to your house. \n\nIs your GF pressuring marriage because mom needs you as a retirement assistance?", "Nope.  Time to get out now\n\nNAH", "NTA. If your gf and her mother are a package deal, you have to consider the long term implications of that.  She is expecting you to fund her mother for the rest of her life. She will live with you or you will pay for her to live elsewhere.  I would head the other way.", "To your last question. I dont believe so, the mother does not make very much money om her own, think a 20+ years of working at a big blue wall and that should help...\nAs for retirement, she hasnt contributed to any 401, roth or such that it would seem realistic for a retirement, let alone a lifestyle without her daughter.", "NTA. What happens if hubby gets out of prison would y\u2019all be taking care of him as well", "Though you're not an asshole for not wanting to live with your MIL, YTA for assuming your girlfriend would somehow dispose of her mother when you chose to start living with her, even though she told you that \"her mother would live with her indefinitely.\"", "NTA - and I respect you for evaluating your future potential as a couple seriously enough to break this off as you can see the mother is going to be living with you both long term.  As you are working on things, can you try living with them before getting married (even if i a seperate room if you don't wish to share a bedroom before marriage)?  Then you'll have a better sense of whether it's a deal breaker or not.  If you truly don't want to (now, or after that), then it seems to me that it's fairer to both of you do break it off if there's no mutually acceptable compromise, as one or both of you is going to end up resenting the other which will undermine the relationship long term.", "NTA.  Don't marry her.  Don't move in with her.  And work on gaining a spine for the next time you bring up breaking up.", "Overall, NTA. We do not know the situation around her mom, and why the mom cannot live on her own. But having that limit/boundary does not make you a bad guy. Saying that, I had my Dad living with me because he is disabled, has dementia...and having worked in nursing homes, refuse to let him go to one. I can see how this would be a deal breaker to some. Thankfully, it's not an issue for my current partner, and he helps care for his Mom...so we both have that in common.", "ESH\n\nMultigenerational households are very common in many cultures. Your girlfriend made it very clear that her mother live with her. If the two of them being a package deal is a deal breaker, than it is. Break things off so you both can move on, or get comfortable with a different social norm than you were raised with.", "YTA. You knew going in this was a package deal, your GF made that clear early on. Yet you chose to pursue the relationship anyway and now three years down the line you're surprised?", "NTA. 56 is a few years shy of retirement age, mom still has time to build her retirement plan. I know rent and housing are expensive but it seems odd that a 31-year-old woman in a long-term relationship is content to allow her mom to tag along everywhere. Barring any serious health issues or disabilities with mom, I'd encourage you to check to ensure the umbilical cord has been cut. Regardless of what you find, dust off your shoes and RUN, FOREST, RUN!!", "In a way YATA just for the case the way you written your post you knew from the beginning of the relationship that your girlfriend wants her mother to continue living with her. They was already living together when you both started dating. This should have been sorted out back then. Before the relationship got this far.", "YTA, she told you how it was from the outset. You were, in fact, naive, as you say, or you were thinking with your dick. You should never get into a relationship assuming things will change.", "YTA for waiting this long to get out.\n\nWhether for cultural  or personal reasons, your GF made is abundantly clear that her mother will live with her.  Why would you think anything changed?  She has ALWAYS planned to live with her mother.\n\nNow you are fully entitled to want to live with only your wife, and not support her family financially, etc.   But that was never going to happen here.  By staying so long, your GF would assume you are ok with her choice.  You know, the one she told you about clearly.\n\nQuit wasting your time and hers.", "NTA. Please spell check. It would make it easier to read.", "You haven't said much about your relationship with the mother, just that you don't want the financial burden, which is a little bit a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*ish, but I totally sympathize with your not wanting to live with a third person for the rest of her life (maybe 20 or even 30 years).

If your GF is serious about taking care of her mother for the rest of her life and having her live with you, then it is something you really have to consider when you thing about if you are going to marry this woman.

After all, your FMIL would be a part of your daily life for, presumably, the rest of your (well her) life, so you need to decide if you can live with that.
