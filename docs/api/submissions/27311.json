Living with family rarely ever works out. You're allowed to change your mind when something like this is sprung on you. You would never be home alone. And you should not be responsible for their poor life decisions. This does not make you a bad person.\n\nEdit to add: I left a marriage for something similar. Ex and brother lived together when we met and dated. I moved in. Ex asked me to marry him. I said yes. But brother has to move out in a year. Didn't happen. All kinds of excuses why. Then ex started pressuring me for kids. No way in Hades until bro is out. He never made bro move. So I filed for divorce.", "NTA\n\nRe-evaluate the relationship or at least postpone any discussions of getting married, if you\u2019re this uncomfortable with the idea of living with your FMIL post marriage then it sounds like going through with it would be tremendous mistake, that will only fester in resentment later.", "You're not an ah, but I genuinely think that your values don't align and thus you should really evaluate your relationship. Sit down and have an honest conversation with girlfriend and see if there's an act of future for you guys someday.", "NTA\n\nI cannot imagine wanting to live with a mother in law, especially at the beginning of a marriage.  Your desires are important too.  \n\nIt concerns me that moving in together would help her, but not you necessarily.  It's natural to want to help the person you love, but frankly this does not look like it would end well.  Unless MIL is a wonderful person whose company you enjoy.", "NTA, I am the sole caregiver for my elderly mother.  Getting old is expensive.  You will have to have a home that is accessible for her and her needs.  You will not have any privacy in your own home.    Will she be going on every dinner out with your, every vacation.  What happens when you have kids, will there be room in the house for everyone.  What happens when dad gets out of prison.  Will mom and daughter expect him to move in as well.  Get out of this relationship ASAP.", "NTA but it sounds like your options are stay with your girlfriend and accept that herr mom will be your burden for the remainder of her life, or walk away. Her mom is still relatively young, and unless she has some kind of medical issue preventing her from working, she should be paying her own way. You're young and presumably want to spend your money on your own needs, your own little family, and we're talking potentially *decades* of you having to take care of her mom? Sorry, but no.", "NTA. \n\nMoving in with someone, spending your life with someone, marrying someone, these are all big decisions and just that you're not automatically jumping into it is a good thing. \n\nI've seen some things, so in my case, I wouldn't move in together unless it was crystal clear that ONLY your GF moves in with you. \n\nThen I'd still keep separate finances to ensure that there's no damn way YOU foot the bill for MIL - but if your house has room, it's still a good chance she'll move in to your house. \n\nIs your GF pressuring marriage because mom needs you as a retirement assistance?", "Nope.  Time to get out now\n\nNAH", "NTA. If your gf and her mother are a package deal, you have to consider the long term implications of that.  She is expecting you to fund her mother for the rest of her life. She will live with you or you will pay for her to live elsewhere.  I would head the other way.", "To your last question. I dont believe so, the mother does not make very much money om her own, think a 20+ years of working at a big blue wall and that should help...\nAs for retirement, she hasnt contributed to any 401, roth or such that it would seem realistic for a retirement, let alone a lifestyle without her daughter.", "NTA.

As you are working on things, can you try living with them before getting married (even if i a seperate room if you don't wish to share a bedroom before marriage)?  Then you'll have a better sense of whether it's a deal breaker or not.  If you truly don't want to (now, or after that), then it seems to me that it's fairer to both of you do break it off if there's no mutually acceptable compromise, as one or both of you is going to end up resenting the other which will undermine the relationship long term.", "NTA.  Don't marry her.  Don't move in with her.  And work on gaining a spine for the next time you bring up breaking up.", "Overall, NTA. We do not know the situation around her mom, and why the mom cannot live on her own. But having that limit/boundary does not make you a bad guy. Saying that, I had my Dad living with me because he is disabled, has dementia...and having worked in nursing homes, refuse to let him go to one. I can see how this would be a deal breaker to some. Thankfully, it's not an issue for my current partner, and he helps care for his Mom...so we both have that in common.", "ESH\n\nMultigenerational households are very common in many cultures.

You knew going in this was a package deal, your GF made that clear early on. Yet you chose to pursue the relationship anyway and now three years down the line you're surprised?", "NTA. 56 is a few years shy of retirement age, mom still has time to build her retirement plan. I know rent and housing are expensive but it seems odd that a 31-year-old woman in a long-term relationship is content to allow her mom to tag along everywhere. Barring any serious health issues or disabilities with mom, I'd encourage you to check to ensure the umbilical cord has been cut. Regardless of what you find, dust off your shoes and RUN, FOREST, RUN!!", "In a way YATA just for the case the way you written your post you knew from the beginning of the relationship that your girlfriend wants her mother to continue living with her. They was already living together when you both started dating. This should have been sorted out back then. Before the relationship got this far.", "YTA, she told you how it was from the outset. You were, in fact, naive, as you say, or you were thinking with your dick. You should never get into a relationship assuming things will change.", "YTA for waiting this long to get out.\n\nWhether for cultural  or personal reasons, your GF made is abundantly clear that her mother will live with her.  Why would you think anything changed?  She has ALWAYS planned to live with her mother.\n\nNow you are fully entitled to want to live with only your wife, and not support her family financially, etc.   But that was never going to happen here.  By staying so long, your GF would assume you are ok with her choice.  You know, the one she told you about clearly.\n\nQuit wasting your time and hers.", "NTA. Please spell check. It would make it easier to read.", "You haven't said much about your relationship with the mother, just that you don't want the financial burden, which is a little bit a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*ish, but I totally sympathize with your not wanting to live with a third person for the rest of her life (maybe 20 or even 30 years).

How would you 3 live together, in the same house or would neighbouring houses / a duplex / house + granny annex be acceptable? Does her mother have ANY money aside or is there an inheritance in the future to cover poor health and medical bills? Is she expected to join you everywhere on vacation, outings or does she have a life of her own with occasional normal family trips/outings together?

For her sake, I hope she has Social Security benefits which will give her access to Medicare which still has to be paid for with a monthly deduction.  \n\nThis is a big privacy issue too not just financial.  You need to put a lot a thought into this arrangement before going ahead with an engagement or marriage.", "NTA, yet.  Follow through on the break up, or you will be.  She was upfront that mom would always live with her, you made a very poor assumption otherwise.  You getting married doesn\u2019t change mom\u2019s needs.  If she\u2019s pressuring marriage you aren\u2019t fully on board with, run.  If you were fully on board with the marriage, and planning a family, having a live in MIL can be an incredible asset.  My wife\u2019s grandmother lived with them her whole life, and it was a great way to grow up.  Multi generational households used to be the norm, and can be very positive if you can provide for enough physical space and behavioral boundaries for everyone to get along.  When we started our family, my wife\u2019s parents (with our consent) retired and moved to our town to be close to the grandkids.  I couldn\u2019t really fathom MiL living with me for the reasons you cite, but a mile away has been fantastic for everyone involved.  When they encountered financial difficulties, and had no savings to bail themselves out, I bought a place for them to live and subsidized them for years until my FIL passed away and my SIL took over support when mom moved to a senior living facility.

Not a good choice. But also I don't feel like it makes you an A H.\n\nHer mother is responsible for her own retirement though.

Your needs, feelings, wants and opinions are just as important to a relationship as your partner's are.**  \n\nI find it concerning that you went into the conversation meaning to break up, and the GF took up several days of your time to wear you down to not break up.  \n\nI find it more concerning that you now feel like you are 'stuck' and can't make your own decisions about your life, as if you aren't allowed to do this for yourself.  \n\n**My concern is that it sounds like you are being manipulated into decisions you do not want to make,** and that you aren't being heard or listened to.   Generally, when someone breaks up with their partner, they **tell** the partner their decision, and it's over.  For your GF to spend days getting you to not end it, and you feeling stuck now, sounds like you aren't being allowed to make your own decisions. \n\nConsider this:  take some time to think about all this, without seeing or talking with your GF.

Someone that is manipulating you, won't.**\n\nWrite it all down.   \n\n* You do not want to support her mother.  **That's reasonable.**\n* Her mother is only in her fifties, and should be working on her own retirement plans, not forcing her child to be her retirement plan.

It's hard for people to adjust to being alone. I never thought, oh well maybe once we are married he will change his mind. Now, it's different from ops situation because my mil is retired and she would be a help for us not a burden. I did tell him that if she gets old enough to need care, I won't be a nurse or caregiver. I know my limits and I watched my dad take care of his mil and it was hard. But if we get to that point we will decide whether in home care is best or a facility.

I won't say it doesn't pose a great set of challenges, but what baffles me about the US is having the opposite mentality while they don't have universal healthcare and maybe not much of other ways of governmental help. That's a whole lot of other issues around families' changes, losses, support systems, etc. And we see them everyday in this sub.\n\nAs for this case, though, I'd say it's an ESH situation, since an open and honest conversation between the two of them didn't happen, the girlfriend seems to be pushing it.
