His wife's safety and wellbeing should be his priority. \nI don't care how \"safe\" a neighborhood is, you just never know in life what can happen.\nAnd to start saying she's a princess is hypocritical. Because she values herself and her safety, now she's a princess?  Well then good for her! The world needs more princesses.\nI would have also called my husband cheap if he had done that to me.

There is nothing wrong with taking a\u00a320 taxi at 3am. I'd have said that's fine you get the bus home. I'll get the kettle on for your return lol. Isn't it funny how we feel guilty about stuff like this? I got a taxi home from work on boxing day as I'd just finished a 12 hour shift and I was beyond tired and just couldn't face dealing with 2 bus rides on a special service.

He thinks you are a princess and you think he is cheap. That is fine. Move on.", "NTA. Considering you were willing to pay for the faster, safer option, I don't understand his argument at all. I get that he prefers the cheaper option, but it wasn't his money.

It was only after I stopped to use a cashpoint at 2am that my view ever changed. \nAs I got back in the car, my partner commented on how brave/reckless I'd been, stopping in a dark supermarket carpark to take out cash. She explained that it was something that she wouldn't dare have done, for fear of being attacked. To clarify, she's no coward, she's a firefighter, totally used to being in dangerous situations that she's trained for but at the same time, she has a healthy understanding of how vulnerable she could be to the wrong person. \nIt's entirely possible that your husband has not recognised a more vulnerable side to you. We're often shaped by our personal experience, so if he's a regular on the tube at 3am and never had a problem, he'd be unlikely to consider the altogether different impact it could have on you. It's not malice or stupidity, just different life experience. \nOpen up, have a chat and hopefully he'll see the world through your eyes, so that next time, such a thing can be avoided. \nI would say that neither of you are assholes here.", "NTA\n\n$25???

From your perspective, if you need to be defended, that means you\u2019re already in trouble!\n\nYou\u2019re not being a princess. You\u2019re being prudent.

It's important to communicate your concerns and preferences calmly rather than resorting to name-calling.", "Where are you in UK that a 3am train is that dangerous? Use them out of London a lot and quite peaceful - most people just want to sleep and most are coming home from jobs like night cleaning. 11-12.30 is a bit more risky as get the drunks.\n\nAll that said, I'd consider \u00a320 to be home in 20mins worth it in terms of not sitting around waiting for very infrequent trains especially at this time of year.  I do it because it is a regular event - if a special occasion then \u00a310 each seems fair for speed, comfort and warmth. Risks though can be higher - know more people assaulted in minicabs than on train - but husband should be deterrance as in being with someone else a deterrance on both methods.\n\nEdit: I am female for what it is worth.", "Nta, my husband would ever let me walk alone or take any public transport that late.

I've read that in some countries it would be safe to ride public trans in the late hours. \n\nI personally would not do it.

Not that I go to London often these days, but I wouldn't drag my Mrs back to wherever we were staying on a night bus or tube with all the drunks and junkies. Taxi far safer and worth paying the extra.", "NAH. It really depends on your financial situation. While you may have the money, are you in a situation where that money is best used elsewhere?", "The issue itself is quite non issue (in terms of ah score) as point of view are valid - just payment of time vs money. \n\nAs for the issue - which is how you communicated, \u05df\nIt seems both of you were kind rude, so mild ESH, but I wouldn't blame you, both of you sounds tired and just want or get going.", "Very mild but...YTA. It's okay to disagree for the both of you, but when you go to getting snappy and getting aggressive rather than properly communicating, you're being an asshole.", "YTA your a princess and theres a bunch of princesses in the comment sections under the guise of time. If you scared just say so guys.", "NAH. Some people are adventurous, so calling a cab and missing out on the adventure of getting home via public transit at 3 am is a waste of money for them.
