He left me behind during thanksgiving, and 3. I had to shamefully cancel our previous thanksgiving plans while trying to minimize the embarrassment. \n\nWhile on this trip, he started saying he was starting a new life and didn\u2019t care if he lost his six figure job that he had worked hard for. When I called or text he refused to respond.\n\nWhen he returns, \nhe doesn\u2019t apologize, he refuses to discuss what happened, and avoids really any discussion.  Fine. Whatevs.  I start focusing on working Christmas decorating and maintenance on the house.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve slowly been mending from the previous incident (I feel, insult).\n\nToday, we woke up and cuddled while watching a movie with our dogs. Then we ate, and I began working on hanging Christmas lights while he took a nap. After 7 hrs outside in the sun, I felt pretty proud of my work (not an A+ but it\u2019s decent). Afterwards, i begin the process of preparing for his work party.\n\nMy husband, waking from his off and on nap, comes to me while I\u2019m naked and have one foot in the shower, YELLS at me that I need to hurry and that he wants to be leaving within 20 min. (2 hrs before the event time.)\n\nFirst I tell him not to talk to me in that way. Then I ask him why we are going so early. He says he doesn\u2019t have time to explain. He then starts ordering me to do things.\n\nSo, I turn off the shower, lay down in bed, and I told him I have a headache. I did this basically saying, I\u2019m not going to tour Christmas work thing. After more yelling and orders for me to do things.  Eventually he leaves solo.\n\nI use the time to make touch ups to the Christmas lights but when he gets home, he\u2019s pissed.

He can't just up and leave, claim that he's starting a new life, then come back and pretend that he didn't do any of that.  And you shouldn't let him get away with it.

Explains his anger too. I know it's hard to withstand and you deserve better but he's sick and needs help. Is this out of character behavior for him?

That's not the attitude or activity of a rational, mentally functioning person that's had a restful afternoon nap.", "But your not supporting him. You\u2019re burying you head in Christmas lights to keep up appearances. You haven\u2019t dealt with his latest episode or whatever you want to call it and his behavior is abusive and erratic.

I\u2019m extremely supportive of my husband, but if he had done what your husband did over Thanksgiving\u2026\u2026 the only support he would have received from me was words of affirmation and encouragement on the way to dropping him off at in patient rehab. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with having a mental breakdown or having an addiction that has spiraled out of control. These are both things that require medical attention. I put them in the same category as someone having a stroke or heart attack. If you ignore the medical emergency, the residual fallout will eventually erode your relationship and you do hold responsibility for that. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA ~ only because I feel like you don\u2019t understand what being a supportive partner means; but if he has a 6 figure job then he has means and access to mental healthcare. Make it your job to get him the care he very clearly needs. Be supportive in that endeavor, but establish your personal boundaries (get your own therapist to help do this).\n\nAs for the Cmas party? He\u2019s definitely lashing out, but whether it\u2019s due to job pressure or relationship issues\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s more effective for you to tell him exactly why you won\u2019t be attending, but you lack boundaries and confidence so the fallback is a headache excuse. It probably enraged him further, but I empathize with you as it\u2019s hard to assert boundaries in the heat of the moment. \n\nStart a journal. Log your emotions and how they\u2019re affected by his manipulative behaviors.", "No. You have been verbally and emotionally abused and (for all you knew) abandoned all in those two times.

It really sounds like like substance abuse on the surface. \n\nIf you \u201cfeel\u201d like he is going through something, you need to talk to him about that and confirm if he is or not. Supporting someone involves helping them find the help they need - aka, a therapist. Marriage is knowing when your spouse is going through something, talking it out together, and finding a way through it together.\n\nMaybe it was stress at work, or maybe it was 8 grams of cocaine that made him act that way - either way, you need to know so you can help him get the help he needs. And don\u2019t forget to get yourself the help you need.", "Yes, but how do you support him if you have no idea what's going on?", "Enabling and passive acceptance are not the same thing as support. You can enable your husband into the grave or passively accept his job loss if you aren't careful!\n\nSupport is figuring out *why* your husband is acting in a way that puts his job at risk and is dismissive of your role in his life. Support then involves helping him to solve his problems, by making a medical appointment for a mental health diagnosis/helping him seek addiction support/confronting him with an uncomfortable truth where necessary.", "Marriage is a partnership. That means you both work together. \n\nThat means if he\u2019s going through stuff, he seeks appropriate treatment so he doesn\u2019t harm you with his BS. \n\nHe\u2019s not doing that. This is a one way street where he does everything he wants with no explanation, treats you like crap and you accept it as your due. \n\nYou deserve better, and your husband isn\u2019t acting like he\u2019s married. He\u2019s acting like an out of control megalomaniac celebrity abusing his staff (you) and demanding only red m&ms.", "Beyond a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol and a severe lack of taking accountability, my guess would be either a breakdown or possibly a manic episode. He needs to see a mental health professional, ideally you both do, because this is not healthy.

That\u2019s the OPPOSITE of support! & because you\u2019re enabling him, it will only escalate. \n\nSupport is when you direct him to the proper resources to correct his erratic behavior!  He definitely needs therapy & you probably do as well since you think his behavior is normal. \n\nIf he refuses help, you need to let him know that you\u2019re not sticking around for Episode #3 & mean it! \n\nWhether he\u2019s going through something or not, you\u2019re not a DOORMAT!!
