I reckon you\u2019re a legend the glass eye thing kinda sucked tho but you can\u2019t completely blame yourself as it was the bird not you!", "I assume you made sure your family was safe from the bird attacks?

In addition to making nice habitat for native wildlife, you may have helped the tree!  Trees typically benefit from occasional urine, but too much can kill them.
