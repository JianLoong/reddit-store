I've been playing with mostly the same group of girls since we were 10 or 11. We're very close, and many of them are my best friends. \n\nI'm a lesbian, and I've been aware of this since I was about 12. For a long time I was really ashamed and I didn't let anyone know. However, last night, I ended up confiding in my friend, \"Lucy\" (16F). Lucy is one of the oldest and most outspoken members of our team. I, on the other hand, am very shy and quiet. We complement each other nicely, most of the time.\n\nI thought Lucy would take it well. We have known each other for years and she's told me about so much of the tough stuff that she's been through lately and I helped her get through it. I was super nervous to come out because this would be the first time I would actually say the words myself instead of over text. I did it. I cried. Lucy was horrified. She recounted times when she and other teammates had shared a locker room with me, been partially clothed around me and sat on my lap when we didn't have enough bench space. She said I was a creep and a predator for not telling the team earlier and that she felt that she had been taken advantage of by letting me into their spaces.\n\nShe ended up telling the rest of the team on a group chat that did not include me and most of them sided with her, according to one of my friends who is siding with me. I feel betrayed not only that she would see me this way, but also that she took it into her own hands to tell the rest of the team. \n\nI really can't decide if I'm in the wrong here. Yes, I have seen some of them wearing little to no clothing, but that's just kind of the nature of the sport. Yes, some of them have sat on my lap, but only because we ran out of space on the bench and they didn't want to sit on the cold concrete floor. Nobody had a problem with it at the time. I never meant to make anyone feel uncomfortable or violated but it seems that that is what I have done, in their eyes.

At all. I\u2019m so sorry this was your coming out experience. You deserve better. You will find better friends, I promise.", "No - you confided in a friend something that was important to you.\n\nLucy's reaction was entirely unreasonable. The implication that you were deriving some sort of sexual satisfaction from your previous interactions is deplorable.\n\nAnd then she went and told everyone else something you shared privately?\n\nI'm sorry - Lucy is no friend of yours.\n\nYou were betrayed.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. I don't know where it goes from here.\n\nWhat I do know is that you can't be kicked off a team for being a lesbian in most of the civilized world.\n\nIf staying on this team is important to you, consider leaning on the authority figures around this team.\n\nUnfortunately there may be no way around other people learning that you are lesbian if you choose that route. \n\nThat being said, I don't know why you'd want to be part of a club team with these other girls after what they've accused you of.\n\nNTA - This one was genuinely difficult to read.", "Obviously NTA\n\nAnd what a bunch of horrible, homophobic a-holes you have for teammates", "You are definitely NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt your age coming to terms with one's sexuality is hard, even for straight people as they learn to deal with the opposite sex. It's even harder for lesbians or gays who have to learn to deal with both. One set they need to learn to rebuff simply because they aren't attracted to that and the same sex they need to learn to try to relate to in a possible romantic way. Teenagers' emotions and hormones are through the roof and many of them can be quite cruel as they learn to maneuver their way through the world.\n\nWhile you certainly did nothing wrong, I can imagine that the news came as a shock and it might make some of them feel uncomfortable because they don't share your same attractions and they worry now about how you might be perceiving them as an object of desire. Unfortunately, they simply lack the maturity to respond to your sexuality appropriately. I know that there are many adults that would respond just as horribly although I do believe more of them wouldn't simply due to greater life experience and exposure.\n\nPlease, don't doubt yourself or regret coming out as who you are. While initially, you may be experiencing some pain and hurt feelings, this will allow you to find happiness down the road because only by being true to yourself can you find someone who wants to know and be with the real you.\n\nMy advice is to face your teammates, look them in the eye, and simply tell them that just because you're a lesbian doesn't mean that you want to automatically jump their bones or that you have been in the past or ever would in the future secretly perv on them. That just because you have accepted your sexuality doesn't change who you've been the whole time they've known you. And as for them accusing you of keeping it a secret, maybe explain that it took a while of you wrestling with yourself to fully understand how you truly feel deep down inside. Not everyone hits puberty and has an instantaneous light bulb moment that tells them who or what they're attracted to. Many people struggle with their sexuality for a long time before figuring it out.\n\nSo please, whatever happens, take heart. You're not alone in being a lesbian. There are literally millions around the world. You have your whole life ahead of you and high school is such a small part of a person's life. Most people barely remember the people they went to school with and few keep more than a friend or two from that age. If the girls on your team stay cruel and ignorant just know that most of the rest of the world isn't like that nowadays.\n\nHopefully, you go to college because there you'll find many people just like you and most likely is where you'll meet and make lifelong friends, but even if you don't go and just enter the workforce afterward, as an adult you'll meet plenty of nice people who'll accept you for who you are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sincerely wish you all the best. Keep heart and look to the future for it will be bright if you want it to be.\n\nPeace.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry that you were treated that way.

And I've heard a lot of homophobic slurs in my years.", "just because she's a lesbian doesn't mean she's attracted to every woman she sees", "It\u2019s not a slogan. It\u2019s a set of beliefs that is demonstrated through the suspicion and ostracism of lesbians (and bisexual women). \n\nPeople *believe* that lesbians are sneaky, especially if they don\u2019t \u201clook lesbian,\u201d or don\u2019t immediately disclose their sexuality upon meeting a person for the first time. People *believe* that lesbians are dishonest, either because they\u2019re lying by omission in order to gain intimate access to straight women, or because they believe that lesbians don\u2019t actually exist and they\u2019re just pretending to be gay for attention. People *believe* that lesbians are predatory, due to the simple fact that they are sexually attracted to women, and therefore similar to heterosexual men, who are seen as *inherently* predatory and cannot be trusted in places where women are vulnerable. \n\nIt\u2019s not a thing that\u2019s going to be articulated much, because it sounds ridiculous when said out loud. It comes out through behavior and policy.", "I'm not gonna reply here as to the OPs situation", "Imagine reading a post about a teenage girl  getting bullied and harassed by her teammates for being gay and still feeling like you, a straight cisgender man, are somehow the true victim. \n\nIncredible."]}
