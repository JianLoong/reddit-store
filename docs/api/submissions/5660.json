I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve just read.

You helped her out when she was in need, and now here you are and she can\u2019t shell out a measly $100 a month (easily $50 a paycheck if she\u2019s paid biweekly). \n\nYour relationship should be a partnership. You shouldn\u2019t have to beg and plead your partner to help you with financial situations. Regardless of whether either person is liable or not for the debt, you\u2019re either in this together or you\u2019re not in this at all. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to live paycheck to paycheck, but you\u2019re struggling so bad you are having trouble barely affording things like groceries for you both, but she\u2019s being a freaking penny pincher and is refusing to help you both stay afloat by contributing to your credit card debt which was also used to fund household essentials that you wouldn\u2019t have if it weren\u2019t for your credit card in the first place.\n\nShe\u2019s either being wayy too frugal or she\u2019s an asshole.

Given the history of how you helped her out, you had a reasonable expectation of some kind of reciprocity once she was on her feet... alas, you got nothing in writing of obligation to the debt. I would say it's time to go back over those times you gave her money to cover her own card, and ask for that *specific amount* back, and then split things 50-50... IF you decide to stay with her. \n\nBut you just got a very up close and personal look at her character, in a meaningful way, and there's a red flag. Yes, maybe you were a bit irresponsible, but her unwillingness to even give back $100 after months of meals, dinners out, and you covering the living expenses shows a lot of entitlement, and a bit of misandry.", "NTA.

If you accumulated debt over time and she didn\u2019t know, maybe she won\u2019t pay as this wasn\u2019t known to her, especially if hers was something she couldn\u2019t help (medical, family, transportation etc.. an emergency of sorts) and yours was more comfort or fun items?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She sounds like she feels entitled to your financial help and that her money should be hers, this isn't fair.\n\nWhat you should do now is ask whether this is the relationship you want for the rest of your life or not, definitely you guys should talk this over again but from what you said your point didn't reach her or she's pretending it didn't.\n\nWhat if you charged her for everything you \"lent\" her then since apparently you guys split everything 50/50 so any help you gave her was a loan?

She was fine with you paying more when she had a bigger debt but now she has more money and she still wants you to pay for everything like you were before.\n\nPerhaps redo your budget.  Give her the info on how much you can pay.  If she still wants you to pay 50:50 then she needs to adjust her budget down.  So if you can only afford $50 for groceries and you've been paying $70 and she $70.  Then she can adjust down to $50 as well.

I good partner should want to help in this situation.", "He wouldn't have been, no. \n\nGranted, I would help my so when we dated.", "Should want to help is different than \"I expect her to pay\"\n\nIs that so hard to distinguish?", "Being hurt that your partner is coming up short is different than expected to pay. He's expecting her to do whats fair. And I have to agree with him. He helped her she needs to help him. The fact that it's financial is besides the point."]}
