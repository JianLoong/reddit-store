It isn't housebroken at all, barks at people when they're eating, has terrible resource guarding issues, but worst off she let's the dog walk off leash with no recall whatsoever. I have watched this dog run up to strange dogs at least a dozen times, and every time I tell her she needed to train him if she's going to do that because one day he's going to approach the wrong dog and it's not going to end well. I actually now refuse to go out with her if she's taking her dog and my in-laws called me dramatic. \n\nA few weeks what I predicted happened. The dog ran up to a very large (on leash dog!!!) who immediately pounced on her dog. Her dog had to go to the emergency vet.\n\nToday I saw her again for the first time and she was complaining about this other dog and that if it was up to her it would be removed by animal control. I don't know why because I'm not a confrontational person but I just snapped. I told her it's her fault and I'd warned her about this exact situation happening. The other owner was doing the right thing when she wasn't and what happened was her fault not anyone else's and that if this isn't her wake up call to either train the dog or keep it on leash then she's being an idiot. I then said the one thing I kind of feel bad about which is that it is her dog that should be taken away by animal control. \n\nShe started crying and saying I was \"gaslighting\" and \"victim-blaming\" her which I'm pretty sure is not what those words mean and that I should be on her side. She said I hate her dog and I said no I feel terrible for your dog, not for you. My husband made the executive decision that we should just leave because she was really working herself up. He's on my side but MIL is now texting him saying I should apologize for upsetting SIL and should have been more diplomatic. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1694996366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lgogb/aita_for_telling_my_sister_in_law_its_her_fault/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dogs need to be trained from day one in order to protect them and you.  You SIL sounds like one of those free range parents who let their children run wild and then complain when others get upset at little Johnny for tearing the house apart.  If she doesn't take better care then she'll need to have her vet on speed dial.", "NTA, she is an irresponsible dog owner and learned it the hard way. People like her are the reason why I believe it should be necessary to make some sort of \"dog license\" to learn basic dog handling skills", "She is lucky that her dog wasn\u2019t killed, either in the incident or from infection. Diplomacy is for people who understand basic etiquette. NTA", "If a dog ran at me like that, I\u2019d punt it like I\u2019m attempting a 40 yard field goal. No apology necessary. NTA", "NTA. Why are people so hell bent on having their dog off leash? My dog is allowed off leash on private property or in off leash permitted areas, but I put in the work to recall train her. \n\nThe issue is there\u2019s a power imbalance between the dogs. The dog on leash can feel trapped and unable to get away, and it can make them more protective of their owners. Many dogs don\u2019t do well with a strange off leash dog charging them while they\u2019re leashed. The dog who attacked SILs dog could now have severe issues being around other dogs again or become fearful when out on a leash. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if your dog is small or friendly. Don\u2019t let your dog run up on leashed dogs. Aka, keep your dog on a leash. It\u2019s not that hard. \n\nOnce again, NTA. This should have been a wake up call for her that her dog could seriously have been injured worse or killed", "NTA - She literally created this experience. The dog is going through pain and needs to heal due to her negligence not learning basic dog training. Yes, your words made her cry but they were truthful. Few people want to tolerate her dog's indoor and outdoor behavior.\n\nWhat is she the victim of?  Herself. Time for her to take personal responsibility but that looks doubtful; it's easier to blame others and cry when she is not coddled.", "Nta\n\nThe ESH votes are unbelievable.\n\nIf I were you, I would call Animal control, because this will not be going to be better.", "NTA. Your SIL is wildly irresponsible and putting her dog, other dogs and other people in danger every time she takes the dog outside. \n\nBlaming other people means she is not going to change her behavior. Her dog deserves better than that.", "I've been attacked randomly by small, supposedly family friendly dogs just walking down the street.  I will kick a dog running up to me if a sharp \"no\" doesn't work and it's going for my kids.  Not sorry.  NTA.  Dog owners like that are risking their dogs and other people's health and even lives.  Little kids getting tackled by even a small dog can cause horrible injuries even if the dog isn't biting. But I can't know if the dog is going to bite in a split second so I will always go with protect kid first, say sorry for kicking your dog later.", "NTA.  She deserves to be told.  Her dog is the angressor and she exhibits no common sense in keeping her own dog safe.  As a dog owner, I despise people like your sister.   The, oh my dog is small, so I don\u2019t have to train or leash it.  I only feel bad for the dog that responded to your SIL\u2019s dog because people like you sister might try to have it put down.", "NTA. Your SIL shouldn't own a dog.", "NTA. Your sister is an idiot and the legal system that allows people to own vicious dogs is fucked up. She\u2019s damn right animal control should be involved. Unfortunately it seems like that\u2019s the rare occurrence of her neurons firing.", "NTA. She needs to take responsibility for her fuck-ups that almost killed her dog, or the poor little guy is going to get killed because she's too lazy to use a leash.", "NTA. She is a terrible pet owner and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have a dog. It isn\u2019t fair to her dog or other dogs and their owners.", "I would actually LOVE for her to try and get police involved so she could be put in her place. She sounds like my absolute most hated type of dog owner.", "NTA\n\nHer dog shouldve been on a leash", "NTA. While I think you could have been more.tactful, you are absolutely correct that this was a disaster waiting to happen", "NTA, and this is not something to be diplomatic about.\n\nYour sister is an idiot and stubborn to boot. Someone is going to get hurt because of her fucking dog.", "NTA. She is, first for getting a puppy from a backyard breeder (or worse, a puppy mill). Second, for not researching the breeds at all. Poms are trainable but stubborn, and huskies are stubborn with varying prey drive. Of course their mixes will be challenging to train, and sounds like she didn't even try. She's the AH for not training her dog as well. Also both of those breeds are very vocal, no wonder he barks a lot.\n\nAnd the most obvious; of course she's the AH for letting her un-trained dog with no recall off-leash. She, and no one else, is responsible for the outcome, and she needed to hear that. She has been putting her dog in danger every time she lets him out without a leash, and she didn't stop despite being warned. Not she gets to face the consiquences. And if it hadn't been another dog, it could have been a car. So irresponsible it makes me mad. Poor dog.", "NTA. \n\n>she let's the dog walk off leash with no recall whatsoever\n\nPeople like your SIL ruin walking trails and public parks. Owning a pet is a big responsibility, and it's clear SIL isn't responsible enough for it.", "NTA also... pomeranian husky mix? What kind of monster would make that happen?", "ESH. Yes she's responsible, but you went too far. \n\nAnd no, that isn't \"gaslighting\"", "ESH - I agree that this was seriously irresponsible of her, and you did warn her. But she's understandably upset about the dog being injured (even if her fault), and you just kept going. You created a whole larger issue that's now involving more family members, as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There have been 5 separate occasions where a small dog has been off leash and run straight up to my boy and bitten him on the mouth or leg. What do you expect him to do in that situation? Is he supposed to just sit calmly while a small dog is biting his mouth? \n\nMy boy has never bitten back. He\u2019s pinned the dogs to stop them and to give them a warning. But he is now reactive on a walk, and I\u2019m having to do extra socializing at training with him because he now thinks that every dog we see is going to randomly run up and bite him. \n\nI\u2019m sick to death of large dogs always taking the blame when it\u2019s the small dog who is out of control. I am a responsible owner, he is never allowed off leash in public, I keep him away from other dogs, I pick up after him etc. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do if another person fails to control their small dog? Am I supposed to get rid of my dog or just never let him leave the house because of some little shit and their irresponsible owners? Absolute BS. \n\nPeople who own small dogs should be held to the same responsibility and accountability as those who have big dogs.
