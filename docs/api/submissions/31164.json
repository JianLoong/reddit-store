Make sure communications channels are open - cc your boss, etc.\n\nOther thing to investigate  - how is she taking on tasks without your knowing? Are your teammates going straight to her with tasks? Get to the bottom of why they're doing that and if they've been instructed to do so. It might be coming from the top (or your boss), which will make the situation more clear.", "NTA\n\nAre you CC'ing or BCC'ing your boss on every email?\n\nSounds like she is trying to replace you permanently.", "She's trying to steal your job, you know.

Especially if it sounds like she's trying to take credit for work and minimize the person that she's temporarily replacing. If she has a good relationship with her supervisor, it might be a good thing to express your concerns about her lack of professionalism in her interactions with you before you go on maternity leave.", "Temp but possibility of getting hired", "There are certain tasks which my manager and teammates give her - but they inform me about it also to keep me in the loop.\n\nThe tasks I'm referring to are my daily tasks that are simply there and need to be done. I've told her before that I'd be handling them until I go on leave but that I might distribute some between us depending on our workloads. I've also informed my teammate and manager about how these tasks are handled between us. I felt like her just going ahead and completing them without at least communicating with me and mentioning to the team how she did it all is a bit of a disregard to what I had discussed with her and a disregard to the work I've been doing.", "She will 100% lie to make you look bad the second you're out the door, OP. If she's doing all this now, imagine how she'll act when you aren't there to defend yourself.

She should at least be responding to your messages but it doesn't sound like you're her manager. Pretty soon she'll be expected to do all this work by herself so it's probably a good thing she's getting it all done without your help. If she's getting things wrong, that's one thing, but you haven't mentioned that.\n\nThat being said, if you think she's overstepping (and continues to ignore you) you should go to your boss and say, \"Jamantha has a great work ethic but she keeps plowing ahead with work that has been assigned to *me*, despite me asking her multiple times to at least give me a heads up if she's planning to do this.

I only briefed her on my tasks she will be taking over once I leave. I've been doing all my usual work and only handing over some tasks that she needs some training and supervision for. Other tasks she is working on are tasks my manager and teammates are creating specifically for her while im still working."]}
