Apologies.\n\nAs silly as it sounds, I (28m) went through a pretty traumatic experience when my best friend moved away two months ago. He and I had been friends since our early teen years and now we're both in our late twenties. It very much felt like a security blanket getting ripped away from me and caused me to confront some intense feelings. He and I are still close friends, but with differing time zones, the stress of moving and getting settled in, and adjusting to a career change, our communication has been limited compared to what it was. My wife helped me through the transition as best as she could, but her patience with the process ran thin rather quickly.\n\nThis came to a head this weekend. During a weekend trip with some different local friends, I got a somewhat impulsive tattoo. It was a design I had been considering for a while, but I got it done it spur of the moment yesterday. I felt like it was a necessary part of my grieving process of what I thought my life was going to look like moving forward.\n\nWhen I came home with it tonight, my wife was incredibly angry. The tattoo has a clear connection to my friend, and my wife said it was ridiculous I was taking things so hard. I told her it didn't feel good, having her invalidate my feelings and that art on my body was my business alone. I don't have any tattoos dedicated to her, so - in a moment of anger - accused her of being petty over that fact. She scoffed, left our home, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I answered this in a comment but I figured it was relevant to add here. The tattoo is just under the bend of my elbow on my right arm. It's a zodiac sign constellation tattoo with 'maybe when I'm older' written beneath it - hence the chosen username here - which are lyrics to a song I've had on repeat the last couple months.\n\nEDIT 2: To address other comments I've been getting: my friend moved due to work. It was a long, hard decision - one I supported since it was the best for his future despite it being brutally hard for us. And about the tattoo - he likes it. He called me right after I sent him photos of it to talk about it and listen to the song I included.", "created_utc": 1670214487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcwttq/aita_for_getting_an_impulsive_against_my_wifes/", "score": 909, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've had friends move, change jobs in a way that precludes us spending time together, etc.  I was sad, but not like you are sad.

Two of us got the keltic knot symbol for sisterhood, two got the kanji symbol for sisterhood and the 5th refrained for religious reasons. It was awesome and so much fun.
