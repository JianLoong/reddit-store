Apologies.\n\nAs silly as it sounds, I (28m) went through a pretty traumatic experience when my best friend moved away two months ago. He and I had been friends since our early teen years and now we're both in our late twenties. It very much felt like a security blanket getting ripped away from me and caused me to confront some intense feelings. He and I are still close friends, but with differing time zones, the stress of moving and getting settled in, and adjusting to a career change, our communication has been limited compared to what it was. My wife helped me through the transition as best as she could, but her patience with the process ran thin rather quickly.\n\nThis came to a head this weekend. During a weekend trip with some different local friends, I got a somewhat impulsive tattoo. It was a design I had been considering for a while, but I got it done it spur of the moment yesterday. I felt like it was a necessary part of my grieving process of what I thought my life was going to look like moving forward.\n\nWhen I came home with it tonight, my wife was incredibly angry. The tattoo has a clear connection to my friend, and my wife said it was ridiculous I was taking things so hard. I told her it didn't feel good, having her invalidate my feelings and that art on my body was my business alone. I don't have any tattoos dedicated to her, so - in a moment of anger - accused her of being petty over that fact. She scoffed, left our home, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I answered this in a comment but I figured it was relevant to add here. The tattoo is just under the bend of my elbow on my right arm. It's a zodiac sign constellation tattoo with 'maybe when I'm older' written beneath it - hence the chosen username here - which are lyrics to a song I've had on repeat the last couple months.

However, I would also never judge my partner for having an intimate friendship outside of our marriage. Love shouldn\u2019t be restrictive or possessive like that.", "Even some of the commenters had me confused talking about \"losing a friend.\" Like, do these people live in places where no one ever moves? Goes to college? Gets jobs? \n\nI've moved across the country like 4 times since turning 18, and I'd be begging my friend to get therapy if they acted like this.", "Same. Skimming, I thought \"maybe when I'm older\" was a poignant reference to someone who isn't going to get older because they died...", "My best friend is 12000km away. We still chat regularly. Thank goodness for the internet", "Friend is also in love with him and he knows so is OP. He's just waiting for OP to leave his wife. \n\nWtf is this bs!? I've never seen someone behave like this well other than the \"joke we can't make here\" Guy. \n\nThe intense feelings he's talking about is him being gay and in love with him. \n\nHonesty, I think he knows he's love with him but he's either using his wife as a cover or just lying to her.", "To be fair, that is just OP's perspective on it. I feel like the friend could have sent a text that said \"looks cool, man. I'll give it a listen.\" I'd be really curious to see what he thinks about it all because I doubt he even would have moved if he was a codependent as OP.", "He probably only got married in the first place so he could do pre-wedding stuff with his bestie and they could be in matching tuxes.", "I agree there is three in the marriage. It looks like it's crowded. By the way op YTA!!!", "Also, nobody is using it as a shorthand for LGBT, it's shorthand for clearly being in love with someone other than your spouse. I could see it as shorthand for guys who delude themselves out of intimate relationships with other men with a wall of toxic, heteronormative masculinity, but nobody I've seen using it is going \"Ew, A Gay.\"", "He probably liked it because it was a clear admission that you're in love with him", "This is so twisted. Absolutely you're more in love with your friend than you are with your wife. Do the right thing and leave so she can find someone decent.", "Real talk\u2026 are you in love with your friend? If so, just clear the air.", "I\u2019ve been best friends with my BF for half my life now and I\u2019ve never once thought to get a tattoo of her zodiac or had a love song remind me of her.\n\nThis is not a normal friendship bond. Or even a healthy friendship bond. It goes beyond platonic feelings.", "It honestly sounds like you are in love with him. You are likely bisexual/gay and haven't had the ability to process your \"friendship\" properly. I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and say you need to get therapy to untangle these complicated feelings. Please also talk to your wife and friend.", "That's what I meant by an inside joke... \n\nLike there are songs that remind me of people not because of the lyrics but because of the context.... The inside joke or secret/personal reference... \n\nBut that does mean some people are going to have questions. And it's an easy explanation of 'not the lyrics but the time we listened to x... Or this was their favorite artist/song/whatevs. Or when we used to sing this together.. or this was our favorite band'", "I don't think it's a matter of platonic love being bad. Loving friends is important. I have no shame for close chosen family. I have a lot of close chosen family. I love my friends. Say it frequently. No shame. \n\nThe song is a romantic love song referenced in the tattoo. And that's where I could see the OPs partner having questions... Especially if they are monogamous and it sounds like they are. Don't think that makes the OP an AH... Just can understand why a monogamous spouse would have big questions.", "For being \"incredibly angry\" over a decision he made for his body.\n\nImagine switched roles, and how he'd get roasted here for being incredibly angry about a tattoo or piercing she had made.\n\nOr a similar posts made by women, we'd be drowning in red flags by now like it was going out of fashion, calling the incredibly angry bf/husband abusive, controlling and whatnot.", "Those are the dynamics of your relationship. I\u2019m glad that works for you. It isn\u2019t for the OP and his wife.", "I think there\u2019s a difference between close, intimate friendships and ones where you attribute phrases like \u201cour golden years\u201d and \u201cmaybe when I\u2019m dead I\u2019ll finally not want you anymore\u201d to someone. The lyrics of the song are very romantic and it\u2019s fair for a partner to be uncomfortable with a song basically saying \u201cthese were my golden years, I keep wanting to go back, maybe someday I\u2019ll finally be over losing the great love of my life\u201d. OP\u2019s wife is surely wondering who he wants to be with long term when he is dedicating lyrics like that to someone who isn\u2019t her.", "I can't even deny it \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nAnd the worst part is, he probably spent most of his wedding with his best friend and it's not even a joke. \n\nAnd this sounds like the whole marriage. He spent all the time with him and just forgot has a wife at home. \n\nI just wanna give the wife a hug and tell her to RUN! \n\nI really hope she divorces him. Not like he's gonna miss her or anything but she needs to get out now.", "Dude literally \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nHow much you wanna bet that if they aren't already having an affair (they have been in an emotional affair for a long time)  than he's just waiting for OP to leave his wife. \n\nI mean, wtf is this? \n\nWho behaves like OP?", "She wasn\u2019t mad about the tattoo. She\u2019s mad about his feelings for his friend and how over the top his reaction has been. The tattoo was just the straw that broke the camels back.", "Well, the question was about the disagreement between he and his wife. He wouldn\u2019t have posted here if they were in agreement. Insofar as anyone who posts here is asking for an opinion, he wanted *opinions* and I gave mine. I\u2019m not saying my opinion is correct for everyone.", "I can see it from a context of not understanding the meaning, but isn\u2019t that kind of the point? They have a song that, through their own history, is meaningful. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the lyrics or if the song itself is a reminder of a particularly relevant time. It\u2019s a personal experience that his wife can\u2019t understand, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. We are much more as people beyond what one person, even our closest partner, can understand. \n\nExample: the theme song to the OC is extremely important in the context of my and my best friends history but I legit couldn\u2019t tell you a line outside the chorus. Doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t consider a lyric as a tattoo for her."]}
