My middle brother basically raised me because our parents were workaholics, so I have a really close relationship with him to this day. When my middle brother moved out he came out as gay as our oldest brother is very homophobic, so he said a lot of stuff about our brother that I don\u2019t agree with. We almost came to blows over the things he said about our brother. \n\nFast forward a few years and me and my eldest brother have a extremely rocky relationship at best. He gets in contact and asks if I could babysit his kids for the weekend. My father had been trying to patch up the relationship between me and my eldest brother, so for my dad\u2019s sake I agreed. At the time his kids were 8 and 6 and to call them nightmares is an understatement. They\u2019d never been disciplined a day in their lives and were the most spoiled and entitled children I\u2019ve ever met. But that wasn\u2019t the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. It came when his kids started telling me things their parents said about my middle brother. My niece and nephew called their uncle, my middle brother a \u201ccock sucking faggot\u201d. Then they proceeded to tell me that their parents call my fianc\u00e9 a gold digging whore who should\u2019ve found a ditch to live in. Background on my wife she was an orphan and as a result there were some in my family who were less than pleased when we got engaged. They thought she only wanted my family\u2019s money. Finally after saying that the final thing my niece and nephew said that if I did anything to discipline them their daddy said he\u2019d kill me. I called my parents and told them if they didn\u2019t come pick up my brother\u2019s kids right then I was going to hurt them. After that incident I told my eldest brother I wanted nothing to do with him.\n\nNow then after I got married me and my wife moved right down the road from my middle brother. Last year my middle brother was in a car wreck and required knee surgery and due to a technicality, insurance refused to cover it. For the first time since my great grandfather passed I used my inheritance to pay for his surgery. \n\nLast month my nephew was in a bad accident racing dirt bikes, and I guess his parents are having difficulty covering the medical bills. My eldest brother reached out and wondered if I can help citing that I helped out our middle brother when he needed it. I proceeded to tell my eldest brother to F off and that actions have consequences. The last time I saw my nephew he was hurling insults at my then fianc\u00e9 and our brother.
