The great thing about it is that you can immediately show that you are willing to change.

Your doing all the work in and out the house with your father while your sister does absolutely nothing. She needs to learn that everything doesn\u2019t come at her aid for free. If she doesn\u2019t then when it comes the time she must live on her own and find and live with her partner she won\u2019t understand anything and she would just be passing the problem to her partner and everyone she meets.

You are disciplining an adult behaving like a child because your father seems to have failed in that regard.\n\nNTA\n\nBeing the oldest sister often sets you up to sacrifice for your younger siblings all the time, you are raised to put others needs before your own. \n\nLove the pettiness, but long term it's not solving anything. I'd suggest positioning yourself as willing to compromise by stopping the pettiness, but moving forward\n\n- devide all chores between you four, brother gets a little less as he is not yet an adult\n- make a chore chart TOGETHER, everyone is responsible to get their chores done, you are not their mom\n- talk about what happens if one of you can't get their chores done in time (have to take over an extra chore, make it up by buying a treat for everyone, etc) \n- everyone is responsible for their own messes\n\n\nIt is not fair to you, that your father basically views you as a replacement partner evening out everything he doesn't have time for. He is also putting a lot of mental load on you.
