When you say those hateful things people take you seriously. Particularly your son.  \n\nIt sounds like you had a rough life and your parents weren\u2019t much help. You need someone to talk to who will really listen.  \n\nAlso, your life is NOT over. You absolutely CAN achieve things at your age.  You aren\u2019t even middle-aged.", "If you view your child as a punishment, you have no business being a parent.", "Agreed. OP is getting a lot of hate but her parents and the father of her child literally destroyed her life. She didn't *choose* this for herself at the tender age of 16.", "That's what I'm wondering lol, I have no idea that this new information has to do with anything", "If she raised him on her own as she said, then she had that choice.", "Adoption is always a choice.", "She probably was given shit all for sex education too, before we start saying well she chose to have sex. Yes, she did, but if you aren\u2019t educated and realistically prepared to make smart decisions\u2026..this is what happens. Parents more concerned with punishing her than what happened to TWO children.", "Yeah but he had zero choice in existing. OP shouldn\u2019t be blaming him for existing when it was likely her actions (and his bio father) that resulted in him existing.", "I get that. Options are limited at that age. It\u2019s hard being a teen parent and I empathize but in the end, we have safe surrender laws and adoption for a reason.", "The son completely abandoning his pregnant girlfriend is not the same as her being abandoned and forced to carry a pregnancy. That said her reaction and attitude in general is still subpar, but not as bad as her parents imo.", "Hey, yeah, the dude who is a dirtbag like his deadbeat dad definitely deserves better! Poor thing, he knocked up his girlfriend and then dumped her like a coward. Boohoohoo!", "She was 16. The real AH here are parents and laws and politicians that make a 16 year child who doesn\u2019t want a kid have a kid.", "She was a child.", "She was 16", "Human beings are capable of feeling conflicting emotions at the same time.\n\nI think you know this, but want to simplify it for your comment's sake.", "Nope, she was 16, barely a child herself. You don't have much of a choice at that age. Her parents were 100% TA back then and now she's being one.", "Not necessarily.  Some places require the consent of the grandparents for an adoption when the birth parent is a minor.", "Oh definitely. We really need comprehensive sex ed. Your points are absolutely valid and so are the other responses to my comment. I do empathize with her. \n\nMy husband\u2019s bio mom went through it. Dad took off, parents were super religious and insisted she give birth. They kicked her out on the street afterward. My husband was put up for adoption after that. \n\nBut in my work, I see what happens to kids who aren\u2019t wanted. I saw the results of it when I was working with adults coming out of prison. A lot of them had their parents do what OP is doing to her son. I wonder how much could\u2019ve been avoided if we had a better support system and education available. \n\nA lot of them ended up in juvenile detention. It snowballed from there. Many ended up joining gangs to have some kind of family. Every time I talked to these guys about their path in life I would be told it was survival. They had no one else.", "Your right. OPs son needed empathy and love. OP needs to go to family therapy and therapy for herself. She sounds like she never developed past age 16 herself. Early trauma like forced motherhood can stunt emotional growth. OP, you need therapy.", "Yep!", "Neither did his child though. Why does he get a pass?", "Not every state has safe surrender laws and not every state (but most) allow a minor to give up their child without parental consent. Backwards as hell, but it is what it is. Not sure where OP is from, but her options could have been even more limited than we know.", "You really think the parents that forced her into having the kid and raising him on her own would\u2019ve allowed a safe surrender or adoption to happen? She was a minor, she didn\u2019t have a choice. Get fucking real\n\nEdit: oh you blocked me instead of responding like an adult, no wonder you took this stance lol", "I was controlled like this.  On another post I explained how much I was controlled and got upvoted.  Had I gotten pregnant, they would have MADE ME, have it,  and would have hit me until I complied with everything they ordered.  I was allowed to go nowhere but work and school.  I did escape, but had there been a baby, I do not think I could have as easily..  Please at least believe that some parents can be horrible, control every move.  Now, she could have put him in the system at a few years old, but please do not downvote her comment where they made her have the baby.  It happens, they wanted to punish her.", "Yet it\u2019s okay for you to kick out your son?", "You would have been better off if you were kicked out. And you could have still decided to give him up for adoption later.", "Are you sure about that? Because everything you just wrote says otherwise. \nYou're blaming him for your life being ruined instead of accepting responsibility for your choices.\nYou had sex, you chose to keep him, and you continue to choose to blame him being born as the reason your life sucks. How about taking a good look in the mirror and accepting some responsibility for how your life turned out instead of blaming YOUR KID. \nYou could have walked away at any time and put him up for adoption, and gotten yourself together regardless of what your parents wanted you to do. You didn't do that. Don't blame your kid for YOUR CHOICES.", "I hope the friends parent reports you to cps. You can\u2019t kick out a minor. That\u2019s abandonment. Someone else can care for him while you rot in jail.", "You have a shitty ass way of showing it! You resent him for having him! You kicked him out as a minor which is illegal!! YTA OP and a sh**ty parent.", "For real. If you love your son, you will show him that you love him, and therefore that having this child will not be the end of his world.", "Ah yes, kicking your child out of your house.\n\nWhat a warm and heartfelt show of parental love. I'm sure his remember this for the rest of his life.", "From the sound of it you need a therapy", "Then TELL HIM you love him and will support him through this no matter what. Jesus Christ be a mother", "Keep telling yourself that", "We clearly have different ideas about love, because everything you said here says you most certainly do not love him.", "You literally said you\u2019ve never been happier after you kicked him out\u2026", "Lol your love is a joke. Hey you suck I wish I never had you and you remind me of your deadbeat father. \n\nYou did this to a 16 year old? You really want to continue the cycle your parents put you thru", "You've got a weird way of showing that you love your son! I hate to think what you'd do if you hated him! It's almost as if you were waiting for a chance to get him out of your life! He's still a child!!", "Oh I never said her parents weren\u2019t huge AHs I\u2019m just saying she could have pursued options. Could have told the doctors or anyone at the hospital that she was being forced and had her parents investigated. Not saying that would be easy, but she can\u2019t now put all that resentment on her son. She also once a legal adult could have reached out to authorities and said she could not properly care for the child", "She didn\u2019t have many\u2026 but still had more than her son who didn\u2019t have the ability to do anything but exist in her.", "He doesn\u2019t. I marked it as ESH. He sucks for the current situation, OP sucks for being a shitty parent his whole life.", "It\u2019s not their choice. I had a lot of friends in similar situations and they managed not to take it out on their kid.", "What evidence is there that her son is a good person? Yeah, he\u2019s a kid and hopefully he will improve, but the only thing we know about him is that he knocked his girlfriend up and bailed, leaving her stuck with the consequences. Absolutely gigantic unempathetic asshole move", "I\u2019m thinking fake.", "From these responses, hopefully fake.", "I mean, it definitely *sounds* like bullshit. Everything OP is saying gives me the vibe that this is all super fake", "It\u2019s not whose choice? The parents? Or their minor child? Because I\u2019ll give you three guesses as to whose choice it is when it comes down to legal adults vs minors. \n\nGood for your friends. Clearly OP got pretty fucked up from the experience.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll give you an extra guess as to a likely reason *why* your friends managed to not take it out on their kid. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make up some shit to make it seem like OP is some extra dimensional unexplainable monster.\n\nEdit: lol aw I got blocked, boo fuckity hoo", "Yea i agree but if its not fake her loving her son is bullshit and she needs serious help if it is fake she still needs help", "That's what I'm saying. In a lot of areas, even if abortion is legal, it requires parental consent. Even if it doesn't, you have to get to the clinic and get care afterwards, which is hard if not impossible if you don't have the support. That's why I can't fault op for not getting an abortion, I believe her when she said it was impossible for her. \n\nThat being said, the kid is here whether she likes it or not. Being a bad parent isn't going to solve her problem. Her parents not being good parents is awful, but it's not the fault of the kid. And her being a bad parent isn't going to turn her parents into better people. She desperately needs to process her traumatic upbringing so she can be a decent parent and person, and likely a happier one."]}
