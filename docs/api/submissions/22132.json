As such, I'll be extra careful or avoid items he values to not damage them. And if I do accidentally scratches or leaves cosmetic damage to his items, he knows that it's not intentional and I try to make it up to him in other ways.

Like someone did it while it was parked in a parking lot, whether at my job or shopping. You cannot control these things and you should accept that. The only way to insure your new car doesn't get dinged up is to never drive it. Or let anyone else drive it.

I\u2019m not even a car guy, I couldn\u2019t care what the car looks like, it just doesn\u2019t seem safe in general and maybe even having her own car isn\u2019t the solution.
