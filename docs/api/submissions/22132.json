To this day it\u2019s one of my favorite cars partly because I never worried about its cosmetic flaws. \n\nOne of my most cherished memories of one of my daughters involves that car.  She asked if she could clean the windshield while I fueled up.  I could hear her chatting away to herself as I had my back to her and when I turned to face her, she was standing on the hood scrubbing away at the windshield.  She was maybe four at the time.

If not, mild NTA because you may just have different approaches to things, but she should be more careful with your stuff.

As long as they\u2019re not just completely slacking off there are times when I\u2019ve just had to accept that people have different comfort levels.

After many discussions about how I'm clumsy or careless, we've finally reached an understanding that we value physical things differently and i don't treasure the cosmetic appearances of my items as much. As such, I'll be extra careful or avoid items he values to not damage them. And if I do accidentally scratches or leaves cosmetic damage to his items, he knows that it's not intentional and I try to make it up to him in other ways. My husband is perplexed by my clumsiness because he would never be anyway close to making the \"mistakes\" I did, so he'll probably empathize with you. While I'm not your wife and cannot speak for her, I truly cannot help my clumsiness and I'm a lot less clumsy than I used to be.

I also understand that your wife probably is aware of how clumsy she is and doesn't need to be reminded further.\n\nMy suggestion is to watch your tone and be very clear to her that you care about her more than your car. I did get into a minor car accident recently and was pretty shaken up. I really appreciated that my husband made it clear that he was glad I wasn't injured and it's just a car.
