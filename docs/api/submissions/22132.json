If not then you might want to consider wife-proofing if she is that prone to accidents.", "NTA. Your wife is careless. If you can afford it, buy her a used car that she can trash and you drive the new one after you get it repaired.", "NTA.  You were being kind until the last straw.  She needs to take a driving course lesson.  Damn.  She doesn\u2019t care about your stuff and probably not hers either.", "I can understand your annoyance at your wife carelessly damaging things that you are trying to keep nice.  (Especially the laptop thing, since she has her own.)  But also, you bought an expensive new car that is much larger than the previous one for you both to use as the new \"family\" car.  So now the only car your wife has to drive (presumably) is the new expensive fancy car, where she has to worry about any tiny scratch or scuff, and is also bigger and hard to maneuver.  \n\nSo, ESH here I guess?  Your wife sounds careless, especially with the \"hitting the dumpster\" incident, and your frustration is understandable.  But also, it sounds like you're more worried about keeping the car perfect than actually using it?  It sounds like you need a two-car situation.  You can keep your expensive new car pristine, and she can get a used car to ding up.", "NTA- I would be upset too. She\u2019s careless. Okay to be careless with your own stuff but inconsiderate to be careless with joint things especially if the other person asked repeatedly to be careful.", "INFO: Did she get any input on this car? Did she get to test drive it, tell you what safety or visibility features she wanted, point out any difficulties she had driving it?\n\nOr did you just buy the car you wanted and bring it home?", "Consider when you are old and grey, looking back on your long life.  What will have brought you the most joy and fulfillment.  If it is your shiny cars and laptops, then don't let anyone use them.  If it is your spouse, then think very carefully how you deal with these issues now and in the future.

If its the household car yta for buying something for the household that you treasure so much to the point of being mad at your WIFE\n\nmy old coworker told me a story.  When they were dating he let her drive his car he cherished and even though she damaged it by accident he let it go because he loved her.  \n\nYou sound like you love the car more than your wife\u2026.", "\"to the point where I am very displeased and I don't want to even drive it anymore due to sheer disgust of it\"\n\nThat part makes me want to say YTA.\n\nAre kids on your horizon? Cause I've got news for you.", "INFO: scuffed tires... Don't tires naturally get scuffed as you drive a car? Do you mean the tires have wear on them? That happens as the car moves.", "YTA. You know that she is a shitty driver; so would you buy a brand new car and create this situation?", "YTA If she's not a good driver you shouldn't have gotten a car for your household that you don't want to have scuffs. You married all of her including her bad driving skills and when you get a car for both of you that should be considered l. I don't think it's okay for you to have a car she isn't allowed to use. \"I'm very displeased and don't want to drive it anymore\". Why? Is it because it aesthetically looks bad? That definitely comes across like a temper tantrum. If the car is still usable I don't think you should really be upset. Things happen and maybe you should work on your superficiality.", "NTA. Girls got spatial issues.  Not sure how to fix that but you might want to try and help.  NICELY.\n\nThere are few differences between male and female brains but men tend to have better spacial reasoning.  \n\nShe might have strengths or tricks to get around these issues and she should play to them.\n\nOne woman told me that she always parks next to someone because it gives her visual cues to help compensate.\n\nI parallel park better than I do pulling straight into the same space, even one with lots of room.  So I do that.  I also can pull into regular spaces from the left but not the right.\n\nI'm dominant on the drivers side.  \n\nMaybe discussing it and helping her find her strengths will help avoid this in the future.\n\nThis is a driving country and it looks like she'll be driving for a long time so might as well figure it out now. \n\nThat's my suggestion.", "NTA and she needs driving lessons or to pay attention more", "Yes, they need separate cars! She can drive a cheaper used car or something. \n\nMy husband and I don't drive each other\u2019s cars. He cares so much about every little scratch, dents, and even odd sounds. If a car runs and gets me to and from where I need, I'm good. I really DGAF about the look even though I'm not actually even careless. We've shared cars in the past without any issue on my part (he's the one causing accidents, not me) but I get so stressed out and anxious when we shared cars just because of the pressure to keep it pristine. I don't want him driving my car for other reasons. People have different values towards different things, and I don't see why one has to force the other to adhere to theirs. We just realize we're happier when we keep cars separate.", "Might not be the best optics. \n\nMy car? I got a brand new expensive mustang.  My wife? Oh she drives that old beater cause you know.

I agree he seems a little petulant for saying that he does not want to drive it.  However, I can understand his frustration about saving up for something and being upset when someone damages it.", "If she\u2019s not a good driver, she shouldn\u2019t be driving.", "The wife drives a \"beater\" because she is a careless, reckless, poor driver.\n\nPut it on a bumper sticker for her car.", "She is contemptible is she can't learn to drive properly, yet she drives on public roads.\n\nShe must be a danger to all other motorists and pedestrians on the road.", "He's so disgusted with his brand new car that he doesn't want to drive it.\n\nHe and his wife have been together for five years.
