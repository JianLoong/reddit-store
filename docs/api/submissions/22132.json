I'm confused why so many people are assuming she didn't know about the car prior to purchase and essentially giving her an out for choosing to drive a car she can't keep from hitting things.", "This is a rough translation... *OP, I know your wife keeps hitting into stationary objects and objects not in traffic but you're not allowed to be mad at the damage, the time you need to spend fixing the car, the time you spent to afford the car, the annoyance of having all these scratches that you can't immediately fix, or your wife for continuing to drive carelessly vecause it makes me feel bad and I need to project that onto you and blame you for not teaching her.*", "You should also consider getting her vision checked. Seriously, something might actually be wrong with her depth perception. \n\nYou should also take her out to an empty parking lot to have her practice knowing how wide the car is. Have her try to stop with various wheels on a mark. Have her pull up within a certain distance of a line, like the line is the sidewalk and she's parallel parking. Have her get as close as she can to a pole on both sides (while you watch to make sure she doesn't actually hit it). \n\nAlso make sure she knows where the pivot point is and why she needs to take turns wider than she does in a small car. \n\nThis stuff comes naturally to some people, but other people really need to practice it.", "Lmao no stop trying to play the evil husband card. She chose the car as well. She is just reckless. OP is treating his wife like an adult and expecting her to be more careful.", "The wife has ADHD, its not that she's careless, it's more along the lines that the wiring in her brain is vastly different to someone who is neurotypical", "Sorry pal but that info wasn\u2019t in the post when I responded, and there\u2019s a big difference in picking out a car you like, and actually test driving it to see if you can drive and park it.", "Yes, it's his wife, he should treat her with more respect and not be so controlling.  That's exactly my point.  If he doesn't want her driving his precious car, maybe get a cheap car for his wife so he doesn't have to worry.  There called motor vehicle accidents where I come from.  Reckless driving, by definition, is a whole other thing.", "You\u2019re like a 16 year old boy who\u2019s never had a girlfriend, right?", "Don't listen to them. This is the typical AITA commenter who will invent their own scenario or assume things all to defend AH wives.", "I'm not sure why it's safe to assume that just because he used his money, his car, his motorcycle that she wouldn't have had any input on the type of car purchased? People use their resources for partners all the time. \n\nAnd since she did approve of the car, what's your verdict?", "She wanted the car! \n\nAlso, being unable to control your car to the point you keep hitting things means you shouldn't be driving anyway so I'm not sure why you really, really, really want OP's wife to continue to drive.", "If that info wasn't there then why did you assume?", "She might be anxious because you\u2019re so worried about this fancy car getting dinged. Y\u2019all need seperate cars.", "I'm 40 with a wife and I don't want my things destroyed", "OP I\u2019m really confused. In the post you said it\u2019s your car, but in replies you say it\u2019s a shared car? \n\nAnyway, you said she never had these issues before the car. I think it\u2019s time you open your eyes a little bit. Yes they come with safety features but it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re unsafe without them. She is struggling to drive the car & it\u2019s the only new factor. Did you choose the car with her or just pick what you want? Which again, begs the question, is it a family car or your car?", "You mean other than the OP mentioning how large the vehicle is and the sheer amount of accidents caused by not being able to park or drive something that large?", "I feel sorry for your wife, can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s very happy with you for a husband.", "Lmao read his comments again before trying to pin him. Wife actually chose the car.", "Lmao its not a good look to rock up to a place with a bashed up new car. Doesn't exactly scream responsible.", "Maybe the stress you put on her by obsessing about the new car is making her ADHD worse.", "Ironically when reading your OP.. I wanted to ask if she had ADHD.  And then you confirmed it without me even asking!", "She doesn't break my stuff and I don't break hers so we're both pretty happy", "That\u2019s what I was asking about..", ">It doesn't sound like she had a say in what car was bought so didn't even get the chance to voice whether or not she can see and drive safely. Don't make a unilateral decision to buy a car \"for family use\" when the other person included in that family use you claim to have bought it for can't use it safely. \n\nUtter bullshit. You invented your own scenario to victimise the wife. In reality, she had the final say and it was her preference for the car.\n\nNice work being an AITA stereotype where you invented scenarios to defend AH women", "I'm still processing that having an issue with a damaged car worth $50-100k is considered \"petty stuff.\"", "Least gender biased AITA comment", "Lol no. Would you a recommend a woman buys her husband a car if he trashed her brand new car?", "No, you don't understand! Careless driving is a cry for help!\n\n/s", "Wife needs to pay to repair the car, maybe then she will be more careful", "Turns out she picked the car which should change your verdict to NTA since it's the crux of your critique.\n\nIs continuing to drive a car you can't safely drive to the point where you're repeatedly hitting things not asshole behavior? It's incredibly selfish to not care about your driving skills.\n\nWhen an old person's eyesight starts to go, no one says \"let them drive even though they obviously can't see.\" You say \"it's unsafe to drive and you shouldn't be driving and I'm taking your keys.\" However, I imagine that you would say that would be controlling behavior from OP even though you know she's driving stupidly and repeatedly damaging their car and other cars.", "So your response to a person who is choosing to drive recklessly is to get her another car of her choice and blame the husband? YTA  and you also might be spineless. OP's allowed to be mad that she's wrecking a brand new car and driving like an idiot.", "Well, she's the one acting like a clumsy kid, so all's fair honestly", "So she should continue to drive while hitting into things?", "You didn't buy it \"together\". You bought it with your own money, from before the marriage. Where's the \"together\" in that?\nBtw, from what you told us, your wife seems very unthankful, and frankly, disrespectful towards you, not consciously of course, but she doing this to your car, which she knows you cherish and take good care of, over and over again, plus damaging your laptop..that's disrespect and unthankfulness for you, I'd sit down with her and had a propel talk with her, because at this point you're just enabling her behaviour of messing your things up. She has her own laptop, she has her own way of transportation (motorcycle), allowing her to use the care is a privilege she's not appreciating, her lack of car shows that.", "Bravo \ud83d\udc4f", "Bullshit, i have adhd and I\u2019m able to park a bus on a postage stamp, she\u2019s just negligent.", "ADHD is not an excuse for not being literally aware of your surroundings when you drive. \n\nFrom somebody who has ADHD.", "What the hell are you on lol. This needs no more info, we have everything we need.\n\n>These questions make this post require more information before he can be deemed NTA.\n\nSaying he can be deemed NTA is implying there is a possibility of him being YTA in this case, which is sooo disconnected from reality, you probably never had a real human interaction in your life", "A lot of these people are treating her as if she has less agency than a dog.

Oh wait wrong post", "Asking someone to not repeatedly ding the car and care about driving is respectful and not unusually controlling. It's controlling in the way that asking your partner to pay a bill they incurred is controlling?\n\nHis precious car? He paid but she picked the car and continues to drive it while hitting into things. How is a person driving so badly and repeatedly on public streets and buildings not the asshole and why not recognize that his wife has agency?\n\nAlso, it's apparently a mid-size SUV which aren't that big. Bigger than a hatchback? Yeah but it's not like she's driving a dualie.The more I read responses like this, the more I like how much respect OP actually has for his wife. You don't seem to think a woman can drive a Tucson/Sportage or Santa Fe/CRV even if the woman wants the car despite how often everyone sees women driving those cars. \n\nI also don't care about you trying to narrowly define Reckless Driving. RD can absolutely include people who consistently disobey traffic devices or drive into objects that are off the road or in public spaces like a parking lot. Motor vehicle accident might also be a legal term in your household but refers generally to a wide use of behavior, including not being able to keep your car from hitting other things. And many places don't refer to collisions as accidents so also don't care about your local use of that term.", "It\u2019s an absolute safety concern for sure.", "Why are you jumping to the assumption that the car was too big and she had no say? Do you typically make all the decisions for your partner unilaterally? If not, why assume that OP does?\n\nAlso, according to OP she chose that model specifically so your entire point is mud.\n\nAt the end, are you essentially saying that op should think his wife is only as competent as a baby or toddler or young school age kid at maintaining her vehicle and keeping it from hitting things?  Even if she doesn't choose the car she is making a choice to be a careless driver.", ">A lot of these people are treating her as if she has less agency than a dog. \n\nStory as old as time on this sub", "ADHD girlfriend here too, accident prone as well \ud83d\ude02 so many scuffs and dings on new car.
