So we decided to sit down and just analyze our finances, like whether we have debt, our salaries, how careful we are with our salaries, etc.\n\nNow I have a dual bachelor's in quantitative economics and psychology and am currently paid $75,000 a year after tax. My boyfriend is a tatoo artist that did just 2 years of apprenticeship after graduating, and he is earning almost 110,000 dollars a year after tax. He is also a manager, but it is just baffling that he is earning so much money from tattooing. When I saw how much he got last year, I made a joke about how he must be scamming people to be able to make that much. He said his tatooo parlor charges what he is worth. I said that no tattooist should be charging that much; wouldn't it make sense to charge by the hour rather than the design? I just felt like it was unethical. He got pissed and said that I was trying to make him feel bad for getting paid his worth and that the tatto parlor is not the only one around; if people wanted to go cheaper, they would go cheaper. He said I pissed him off and went to his room.\n\nI didn't think us discussing finances would lead to such an argument; I was just stating my opinion on his industry. I am not bothered that he earns more than me; I earn a very comfortable amount of money for my lifestyle, but seeing how much he makes a year on average just seemed unethical to me because for him to be earning that much, the parlor has to be charging criminally high.

Just happens that his medium is ink and human skin. \"Unethical\" my ass, nobody's being forced to go to that parlor. They know what they're paying and it's clearly very good and popular to stay in buisness.", "YTA. WTF? So, should he undersell himself because you\u2019ve decided he charges too much? That\u2019s asinine. A good tattoo artist in a clean shop is expensive, and they damn well should be - it\u2019s permanent art on someone\u2019s body and doing it right/clean is critical. What would be unethical is to do crap work in a less than stellar environment. You need to apologize and maybe learn a little more about his industry - considering that one of your degrees is in quantitative economics, I imagine you can sort out market rates for a skill in your area.", "YTA\n\nAt the end of the day, tattooing is an art. It's especially important that the artist is skilled given this art is going on a human's body.\n\nYou seem to think that artists should only get paid by the hour, rather than based on the quality of their work. That's not correct. Artists should be valued based on the quality of their artwork.\n\nPeople who get tattoos don't just walk into just any parlor and get a tattoo. They do their research and see the quality of work the artist is producing. \n\nIf he was putting paint to canvas instead of ink to skin, would you make the same comment?\n\nYou just devalued his skill by calling him a scammer. \n\nArtists are already criminally undervalued in our society.", "YTA \n\nDo you not know how much a quality tattoo costs? Do you know how many hours goes into designing and executing a top notch tattoo? Could you not google and find out? A high quality tattoo can run into hundreds of dollars for a half sleeve or full sleeve, and even more for a full back or chest design.\n\nYour boyfriend is obviously a high quality tattooist and people are obviously quite happy to pay him for his work. Would you call Andy Warhol unethical because his paintings sell for millions? \n\nYour boyfriend is an artist, and art is subjective. He makes money because he gives his clients what they want, and probably is really good at putting them at ease and making them feel comfortable, safe and well taken care of.\n\nIf people are happy to pay top dollar for his services as a first-rate skin artist, be happy about it instead of maligning his craft, that he's trained for years to perfect, just because you don't understand how the industry works and what a good tattooist is worth.", "YTA\n\nIf he's a good tattoo artist, then he's creating unique artwork for each client, applying it with the greatest care, and accuracy, to be something they will be happy living with and displaying on their bodies for decades.\n\nHe's also having to maintain very strict medical hygiene standards, to ensure that his clients don't contract infections and heal correctly. \n\nThe time that goes into each tattoo is not just the time applying it to the skin.  If he's doing top-quality work, there will be consultations with the clients.  Drafts of potential designs.  Working a chosen potential design into a final work of art.  Then, finally, applying it.  The complexity of the design and the level of individualization the client wants in their design has as much or more to do with the amount of work that goes into it than just the number of minutes for the final application of the design. \n\nA simple but unique design, purchased with the understanding that it will not be re-used, is much more effort than having the client chose something more complex out of an existing portfolio.", "YTA Did you even do your research or are you just jealous? Either way definitely the AH.", "YTJA - You\u2019re the jealous ass. You must also be jealous of those who went to trade school and are earning far more than you do despite all the schooling you decided to get. You should have been more appreciative of your partner\u2019s success.", "YTA - do painters or sculptors get paid hourly for their art? No, they get paid by the piece.

You should be proud of him", "YTA. You are bothered by how much he makes", "Yeah, YTA. \n\nA lot of what I want to say has already been said, but I want to add that if he's being paid 110,000 dollars a year, it is clear to me he's very talented and should be paid his worth. \n\nNot to mention tattooing or art in general, you pay a lot for good quality stuff. Tattoos, depending on the size, complexity, and area of body, can take a lot of time, and you should be handsomely for it. And like, if you live in a nicer area or if he works at a nice tattoo parlor, of course, they can charge more because of their clientele.", "YTA.  As long as the charge is made plain to the customer up front, there is nothing unethical about charging what the market will bear - especially for a product/service that is clearly not a necessity.  The customer is free to walk away or see if he can find it cheaper.  And if he's pulling $110k, the market is bearing it just fine.", "YTA. He must be talented, you should be proud of him instead of jealous.", "YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s an artist. Tattooing is art.\n\nIs an art gallery scamming people for charging thousands of dollars for a painting?\n\nBesides artistry, tattooing is also a service. A good tattoo artist is going to consider how a piece will age, the best way to place it on the body, how to minimize pain, and countless other things. There\u2019s a huge difference between a high quality artist and a poor one.\n\nDo people in your line of work get paid more for their expertise and the quality of their work? Why, when someone could just hire someone cheaper straight out of college?\n\nYou aren\u2019t being rational. You\u2019re being snobbish. \n\nI would put a pause on marriage. You shouldn\u2019t marry someone you find beneath you. He shouldn\u2019t marry someone battling judgmental insecurities.\n\nIf you actually, genuinely love this man then accept him as he is: driven, artistic, and successful.

As an economics person, I think you would understand that people will pay more for good quality and those that can\u2019t pay as much will settle for something less.

Yea you don't always need drawing skills (they severely help because if you can free hand a design onto skin via pen and the client loves it they will come back. But also sometimes hand drawing a design gets you more clients) but even using digital art you need to be able to make it work.\n\nYou need a steady as fuck hand and the knowledge on how not to fuck up someone's body! Also ink, needles cleaning supplies etc ain't cheap.\n\nAlso. Finding artists who charge by design vs hour is really hard so he's in a niche group. Most do by hour and that charges so much more even for basic designs. Without extra shading or details a simple sunflower and some words was going to cost me over $200 cause it's by the hour.\n\nBy design means he can calculate how long it's gonna take and taking the info from clients (shading, details, colors, size etc)  and make a one shot price which means the client comes in knowing it's going to cost X regardless how long it'll take. By the hour means they may expect to pay $300 and next thing they know it's 1k because it took longer than they thought.\n\nThat's when you get people who don't pay up due to \"unfair price increases\"\n\nYour partner is doing it right. And also he's a manager AND artist that's a big deal. He's gaining experience in both sides so if he wanted to down the road to open his OWN shop up.\n\nAnd he has a point. They want cheaper work they can find it. But cheaper isn't always better, because the cheaper you go the crappier the artist sometimes, because they may not care because it's a side gig.\n\nAlso. The parlor/studio doesn't always set artist prices btw. They charge the artist a set amount to rent a space yes, but the ARTIST is the one who sets their own prices typically. Unless they are an apprentice under a mentorship then maybe the mentor sets prices but typically a full fledged artist picks his own prices and set up, and pays the parlor rent for the space/chair. So you're calling your partner unethical because he knows his worth and is charging right.\n\nFfs the artist I'm going to? She charges a $200 deposit JUST to get a consultation for a tattoo, she applies that $200 towards the final price of the tattoo of course but she still charges between $60-$80 an hour on top of it. Or she might be closer to $100 an hour cause my one leg sleeve is gonna be at LEAST 8-12hrs worth of work and it'll be close to $1,000-$1,200 in the end not including tip. (Yes tip your artist people.)\n\nAlso for people wanting to go to a shop. Number one advice I can give without going into the whole thing about artists. For the parlor/studio when you walk in, look at the floors, see how clean they are, because the cleaner the floors the cleaner the shop, and how they handle your health with needles etc.\n\nCleanest shops I've been to had the best safety practices for ink and piercings, very hands on with keeping everything sterile and one use only etc. \n\nEven the garage tattoo shop my mum used to go to had some of THE CLEANEST floors ever and he was super OCD about everything with his supplies. Everything was literally opened out of packaging in front of you. Medical grade everything it felt like as a kid. Get inked/pierced safely!", "YTA. How is it unethical when people can choose whether they want to pay his fees or not? Unless he\u2019s telling them one price and then halfway through holding them hostage for more money or something, there\u2019s nothing unethical going on here.

Cheaper places are out there, but people go for quality or name recognition.

A lot of people view tattoos as an investment *because* of the permanency. It\u2019s also an industry where tipping is expected.\n\nHis work involves creativity, customer service, and adhering to strict safety standards. Also, no, it does not make more sense to pay by the hour instead of design.

So we decided to sit down and just analyze our finances, like whether we have debt, our salaries, how careful we are with our salaries, etc.\n\nNow I have a dual bachelor's in quantitative economics and psychology and am currently paid $75,000 a year after tax. My boyfriend is a tatoo artist that did just 2 years of apprenticeship after graduating, and he is earning almost 110,000 dollars a year after tax. He is also a manager, but it is just baffling that he is earning so much money from tattooing. When I saw how much he got last year, I made a joke about how he must be scamming people to be able to make that much. He said his tatooo parlor charges what he is worth. I said that no tattooist should be charging that much; wouldn't it make sense to charge by the hour rather than the design? I just felt like it was unethical. He got pissed and said that I was trying to make him feel bad for getting paid his worth and that the tatto parlor is not the only one around; if people wanted to go cheaper, they would go cheaper. He said I pissed him off and went to his room.\n\nI didn't think us discussing finances would lead to such an argument; I was just stating my opinion on his industry. I am not bothered that he earns more than me; I earn a very comfortable amount of money for my lifestyle, but seeing how much he makes a year on average just seemed unethical to me because for him to be earning that much, the parlor has to be charging criminally high.

How long and hard work it is to design great art that people want on their body? To manage a tattoo shop? Clearly not if you made a joke that he\u2019s scamming people and his job is unethical!

For a shop that is clean, well regulated, and with talented artists, you'd be quite shocked at the rates. \n\nI used to work front desk in a high end shop that required us to charge by the square inch regardless of the intricacy or ease of the design. If you wanted a souvenir smiley face just to say you got a tattoo from this shop, it would be $75, which you could argue was not \"worth it\" but people paid it by choice or they could choose to walk away if they didn't like their quote.

Sure, they both serve food, but you will pay more at Puck's place because of his reputation.  I would also bet the experience is vetter as well.", "I don\u2019t know but he did tell me he charges by the design, He does manga/manwha/anime tattoos am not sure what they call those tattooist but he said his tattoos require more finesse than some other so he charges more than the average.", "What the fuck are you talking about?

C\u2019mon, you know that price gouging means temporary supply/dammed shocks following some abnormal market event.  What a terrible analogy.

A stupid one too, because anyone who gets a tattoo gets a quote first, so they know what the cost is, and can decide if they want it or not. \n\nA tattoo is not a basic need. Your (hopefully soon ex) boyfriend is not denying anything that anyone needs to survive or even be comfortable because they can't pay it.
