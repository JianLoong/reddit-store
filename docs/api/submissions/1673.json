Nope.", "Nta I agree with your husband", "NTA, but I doubt you are going to win this. First of all, I do not think that having his sleep routine violated is going to ruin your son's life. It's not even going to ruin his week. When you are in the hospital, in labor, having your baby, and everything else that entails, most likely your son is going to be aware that you are not around, Grandma is, and he will probably stay up all night and sleep much of the day. Then she will get a break. Some things, you just can't control. And after the baby comes and you are all back home, there will be much more upsetting him and his routine than your mother. You never have to have her in your house again, unless there's a situation where you have no choice. When your son gets older, he will have friends, and their sleep patterns will be different. He will become aware of this if they stay over or he stays over at their house. Again, it's great to have a consistent sleep routine, especially with a kid who isn't calm natured, but I don't believe everything is going out the window forever because of this. This is not to say that your mother does not violate boundaries, or has the right to behave the way she does. Especially flipping you off and swearing at you in front of your son, when you were trying to get him calmed down. He may not understand any of this dynamic right now, but you've got a lot of time to deal with all of it. Good luck at the hospital, and congrats on the new baby.", "I get that you need her help, but I hope that once you are safely done with giving birth, that your husband picks up your son and that the two of you never rely on your mother again, and I would put in some hard boundaries, but her behavior is unacceptable. She is not allow to treat you or your husband that way, and she did it in front of your son. You can count on the fact that she will continue to do so as he grows up and you need to shut all that down. \n\nBest of luck with the induction. May it go fast and smooth. Especially fast. LOL.
