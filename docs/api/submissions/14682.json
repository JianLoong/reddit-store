Having autism doesn\u2019t give you a pass to control other peoples choices and lives.", "NTA.\n\nI get that sensory issues are very troubling for people on the spectrum but by the age of 32 and seemingly high functioning, these are things that should be known and ways to diffuse the situation should be planned for. The fact that nobody shot down your order point blank, knowing what was going to happen, is a failure on their part to adhere to the needs of their family member and setting you both up for failure. Sure, you didn't respond the best way but they also seemingly came out you with intense blame and strong feelings about you purposely trying to disrupt the situation which I gather wasn't your intention at all. I get being frustrated by the situation but  putting the responsibility solely on you isn't justified. It was just a crappy situation and the result should have been learning better ways to communicate about these things than placing blame.", "Lollll NTA.

If the reason was the crunching, I would say probably skip ordering them. But if the reason was the olives, I'd say forget it and order the nachos. Mysophonia is one thing, but dictating every detail about what other people can eat is another.", "NTA. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with autism and so I am basing my thoughts in little experience and aknowledge that. However, knowing that you were going to a restaurant where there were dishes that could be triggering to BIL, why didn\u2019t BIL or his parents create a plan? As has been pointed out, he practically assaulted someone for eating meat near him when he was vegan for a time period so there is no way the family didn\u2019t know that it was possible he could lose his self control on anyone in that restaurant. Especially a restaurant known for food similar to what triggers him? That blame falls on BIL and his family. Your wife, as noted, wasn\u2019t clear or upfront and that is problematic. She could have said, chips will trigger and outburst, please don\u2019t order that rather than being vague. It sounds like she was vague because perhaps the mention of his issues can trigger a bad response as well and in that case the family again should have better prepared for this outing. You self named yourself the AH for your words and I agree but I don\u2019t think your choice of order makes you an AH", "NTA. He needs to wear ear plugs or ear defenders if he has intolerable mysophonia, he needs to stay home if he can't handle social situations. I can't see at all without my glasses, I don't get to not wear them and demand other people read things for me. When I was unable to walk and in a wheelchair, I had to use a wheelchair, I didn't demand to be carried by others. The same principle applies, he can't function without earplugs/defenders so he doesn't get to demand you not make noise - he can block it out. As a disabled person, ultimately, a responsibility to manage their disability to the extent that they can - he can manage this and is choosing not to and being facilitated.", "NTA.

Lol nta", "NTA\n\nIf his mysophonia is is so extreme, he should not be in a restaurant without noise cancelling headphones. It\u2019s not like they can make an entire only offer soft foods. \n\nBut play the long game. Apologize & make nice. Plan a nice night out to dinner with FIL & MIL. When they try to include BIL point out that with his extreme mysophonia it would be really cruel to put BIL in the position to listen to all those people chewing & crunching and you just can\u2019t stand putting BIL in such a stressful & unpleasant position.

To dampen all the sounds in the restaurant......would that work?", "And then make it a point to eat them around him. I have Autism, if my triggers are that string I... wait for it... AVOID THEM. Its not the entire restaraunts obligation to capitulate to MY sensitivities. BIL has lost all rights to respect here imho. NTA", "I would still have ordered them and said \"Oh well, I'm hungry, he's and adult and will get over it\"", "You cannot compare someone with autism to someone who simply doesn\u2019t like something.", "I think you are confused. BIL is 32 and watching the 19 year old, there have been comments calling it \u201ccreepy\u201d. The Op and his wife are both 25\u2026 at least as I read it.", "Huh? OP and wife are 25. Brother in law (32) was planning on watching a 19yo streamer. Yea, sure, could be creepy, but also not a thing actually relevant to the OP or judgement.", "OP and their wife are 25, BIL is wife's older brother\n\nThe streamer thing, yes, but \"wife\" is OP's wife, not BIL's wife", "It\u2019s not ableist to say that having your ordering be dictated by somebody else at a restaurant is unfair and restrictive, OP is allowed to order what they want and not be harassed for it. The language they used was wrong, definitely, but they\u2019re not wrong for having this position.", "Please. \u201cSlightly\u201d? Really?", "Um ok so wishing someone to get kArMa iN LiFe for not accommodating someone\u2019s whim (YES, I said WHIM) to the most microscopic detail is strange at best. Should the people in the whole bar have been briefed on not ordering nachos, on the off chance that it might make a stranger feel bad?", "It takes such a minimal reading of the comments to see how people, even some people with autism have said that BIL is overreacting or stuff like that, he\u2019s clearly not the asshole, they planned this without him, if there was a problem they could have just left him at home, of course he\u2019s resentful that BIL affected his life and threw a hissy fit over some basic shit he wasn\u2019t even meant to be a part of.", "I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t use \u201cdifferently abled.\u201d Speaking as a disabled person, it would be appreciated.", "That ain\u2019t slight. That\u2019s a man being absolutely unhinged. There\u2019s a difference between reasonable accommodations and enabling bad behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s arguably reasonable to not order nachos if OP knows his BIL can\u2019t handle it. It\u2019s unreasonable to justify BIL being controlling of other people to the point he screams at them.\n\nIn the comments, op said when BIL was vegan, he literally threw a cup of water on a random stranger who was eating a hamburger. \n\nIt\u2019s not ableist to expect an autistic person to be kind to people.", "So another adult with a long long long list of \"things that set me off\" is the decider in what someone can eat? and according to OP's other comments on this thread it appears his list changes often.  Seems to me like an enabled adult issue. but that is just my opinion.", "As an autistic person. He's not the AH.", "Then he shouldn\u2019t go to public restaurants.  What happens in the person in the booth behind him eats nachos?   Does he start shrieking?\n\nOP mentioned in another comment that the person threw water in a stranger for eating meat.  Such a person shouldn\u2019t be in a restaurant.", "But he CAN control what he does to limit sensory triggers in public. Like noise cancelling headphones or ear plugs. If OP didn\u2019t order nachos, someone at the table right next to him could have and he certainly can\u2019t dictate what a stranger can and cannot eat.", "Sorry, but if he's out in public, it's his problem. Not everyone else's. What if people on the table next to them got nachos?", "How was he supposed to know he had this issue when nobody told him!?", "Buddy shouldn't be going to restaurants then, as he will always be hearing things that give him sensory problems. \n\nI'm surprised they even brought him to one if this is how they know he will react.", "That's BILs problem to deal with. If you cannot be around people eating common foods you need to remove yourself. Nobody is obligated to accommodate your illnesses, its your responsibility to either manage them or remove yourself from situations that trigger you.\n\nIf you cannot be around someone eating some chips you don't go to venues that serve chips, it sucks for you but it's your issue. Nobody should be imposing their issues onto others.", "Then *why* does BIL even go to a restaurant that is full of people doing those things?  OP can't conrol what the people at the next table order.  OP says BIL assaulted a random woman in a park for eating something he didn't like.  He's a menace.", "What happens if the table next to him orders nachos?\n\nI kinda feel like you're screwed, even if you're not wrong. The family you married into are bonkers and that won't stop - your wife in their camp too \n\nI'd be seeking to find some way not to see them as often, like moving significantly far away. Is such a thing possible?\n\nAlso, what's the plan when her parents die? You expected to step up and take care of BIL?", "Dude... don't turn yourself into TA after I just said you weren't. It's very common for autistic adults to enjoy content that is for a younger group.", "Reading these puns was torta.", "jfc\u2026 sounds like he needs to go to a care home if he\u2019s a danger to the public. he\u2019s a walking lawsuit ready to happen", "I won't lie, if I was minding my own business and some random person came up to me and threw water over me ruining my food I would knock the dude out without question just on the principle of ruining my damn burger.", "WTF, unhinged behavior!", "Oh fuk no", "Me too.  Why one person poor behavior is allowed to control entire groups of people is beyond me.", "Totally agree. That\u2019s not what I meant to do. I have a 22 yo nephew who has autism and lives in a group home. I love him dearly which is why my sister pisses me off. I see what he goes thru every day of his life.", "[deleted]", "My daughter is 7 and non verbal... I'll say differently abled. Thanks", "OP had the opportunity to avoid this situation and chose not to.   \n\n\nHonestly if i were op i would probably avoid contact with that person most of the time as they are obviously not compatible. If thats not possible i would accept that i have to cope with the situation and get out at as soon as possible.", "Exactly.   If it is that bad,  what does he do if someone in a table next to him eats nachos?  Because that could be just as close", "I don\u2019t know all the details but they won some major lawsuit against a school district over the way they treated him and supposedly that money is in a trust fund that will be used to care for him. My wife promises we are not on the hook for that.", "I mean she\u2019s a 19 year old called \u201clivvy with cannons\u201d who has an only fans. It\u2019s not like a Lego building channel", "Yeah, I'm sure that's why he's watching the 19 year old girl on tik tok...", "[deleted]", "Yessss for real", "People can be charged with assault for throwing beverages, including water, on people!", "Yeah it really is\u2026I\u2019m not speaking for all people with his issues but for him I\u2019d say it\u2019s 20% autism and 80% fat spoiled brat who manipulates people to get his way.", "It does not matter. OP is not his BIL\u2019s caregiver. The parents need to not bring their son to restaurants if he will meltdown (and, in some situations, assault) other people. It is not okay at all.", "Hey, you can calm down. The content the creator makes or her gender were not part of the OP and didn't come to light until later.", "Reading comprehension my dude. You have some key details very wrong.", "Has his family gotten him therapy to work on coping strategies or have they just enabled his whims? Because step one you work on with little kids is learning you can\u2019t control the people around you just how you cope with your triggers.", "Eh, you really are not in any position to diagnose that, are you? Your resentment towards this person is pretty unhinged. Changing my vote because you seemingly have no sympathy and have made no attempt to set any healthy boundaries on this issue, content to just sit and be judgmental and mad until you finally blow up. Your behavior is pretty childish as well, but unlike him, you don't have any excuse.\n\nYTA", "[deleted]", ">Hey, you can calm down.\n\nNice bait m8", "Her age and gender are part of the OP. Not the type of content she creates though.", "When he mentioned her age/gender, being an influencer, and nothing else to me at least it's pretty obvious the type of content she creates.", "My dude with all respect: shut up \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Autism isnt an excuse. BIL CAN do better but is being coddled back to infancy. Nooope, I'd be fed up and frustrated too. And he can F right off about the olives too cuz them shits go on EVERYTHING", "OP insulted his BIL but that is not a hissy fit at all. He was a bit of an AH but not more than his parent in laws for not managing their child who clearly can\u2019t handle being in public eating establishments", "Yup. Missed the gender. But still, no idea what type of content. It could have been cooking for all we knew. But now we have new info.", "I'm in my 40s and don't use tiktok often. It's not obvious.", "you all have zero emotional maturity lol", "As an autistic person: just stop. Autism doesn\u2019t make a person act like an AH, they have to bring that to the table themselves."]}
