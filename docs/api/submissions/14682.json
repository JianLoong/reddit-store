The fact that nobody shot down your order point blank, knowing what was going to happen, is a failure on their part to adhere to the needs of their family member and setting you both up for failure. Sure, you didn't respond the best way but they also seemingly came out you with intense blame and strong feelings about you purposely trying to disrupt the situation which I gather wasn't your intention at all. I get being frustrated by the situation but  putting the responsibility solely on you isn't justified.

If the reason was the crunching, I would say probably skip ordering them. But if the reason was the olives, I'd say forget it and order the nachos. Mysophonia is one thing, but dictating every detail about what other people can eat is another.", "NTA. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with autism and so I am basing my thoughts in little experience and aknowledge that. However, knowing that you were going to a restaurant where there were dishes that could be triggering to BIL, why didn\u2019t BIL or his parents create a plan? As has been pointed out, he practically assaulted someone for eating meat near him when he was vegan for a time period so there is no way the family didn\u2019t know that it was possible he could lose his self control on anyone in that restaurant. Especially a restaurant known for food similar to what triggers him? That blame falls on BIL and his family. Your wife, as noted, wasn\u2019t clear or upfront and that is problematic. She could have said, chips will trigger and outburst, please don\u2019t order that rather than being vague. It sounds like she was vague because perhaps the mention of his issues can trigger a bad response as well and in that case the family again should have better prepared for this outing. You self named yourself the AH for your words and I agree but I don\u2019t think your choice of order makes you an AH", "NTA. He needs to wear ear plugs or ear defenders if he has intolerable mysophonia, he needs to stay home if he can't handle social situations. I can't see at all without my glasses, I don't get to not wear them and demand other people read things for me. When I was unable to walk and in a wheelchair, I had to use a wheelchair, I didn't demand to be carried by others. The same principle applies, he can't function without earplugs/defenders so he doesn't get to demand you not make noise - he can block it out. As a disabled person, ultimately, a responsibility to manage their disability to the extent that they can - he can manage this and is choosing not to and being facilitated.", "NTA.

Lol nta", "NTA\n\nIf his mysophonia is is so extreme, he should not be in a restaurant without noise cancelling headphones. It\u2019s not like they can make an entire only offer soft foods. \n\nBut play the long game. Apologize & make nice. Plan a nice night out to dinner with FIL & MIL. When they try to include BIL point out that with his extreme mysophonia it would be really cruel to put BIL in the position to listen to all those people chewing & crunching and you just can\u2019t stand putting BIL in such a stressful & unpleasant position.
