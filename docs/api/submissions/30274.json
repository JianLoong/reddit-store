This is something we don't get to due often because she is always busy with work or with my three littel brothers. The night of my birthday/day before our plans, she and her boyfriend (M, 30) who I'll call \"Adam\" come home from work. My mom and Adam imeadilty started packing and so my sister and I asked them what they were doing. \n\nMy mom then told me that they were going out of town for the weekend. Being confused I asked her what she meant because we had plans for over a month to hang out. Adam then told me there boss was paying for everything and they were going on a fishing trip and would be back on Monday.  I am aware that I am a very sensitive person as I imeadilty got upset and wanted to cry, I asked my mom \"What about Saturday\" and she sort of shrugged at me, before going on to say that \"we will go another time\". My sister (F, 17) made a small comment about how it was \"Rude to me\" for her to just up and leave on my birthday. \n\nMy mom offered to stay home but I could tell she was really excited so I told her to go. Before they left she gave me $200 for my brithday present. A few hours after she left my brothers who are still relatively young (ranging from 7-12) began to ask us what was for dinner. My mom hadn't taken anything out or bought groceries; so long story short I spent all my money making sure they ate every day and didn't go hungry. In my mind I couldn't let my brothers be hungry knowing I had money. \n\nWhen my mom and Adam came home a few days later she asked me where all my money went because I made a comment to my sister about being broke already. When I explained to her what happened over the weekend she got very angry; my mom started yelling at me and saying many things along the lines of \"I can't believe your ass spent all that money on food\", \"I can't even look at you get away from me\" and \"You make me actually sick to my stomach\". \n\nMy realshonship with my mom has never been great but that last part really hurt my feelings. I imeadilty went to my room very upset and started crying, I didn't come out for diner due to how upset I was. Due to my thing walls I could hear my mom talking about me to our whole family at diner basically saying she would never give me anything again and how pissed she was. \n\nThe next day when I'm doing the dishes my mom walked into the kitchen and apologized but I was still very upset. So I ignored her, she tapped my shoulder and asked if I had my airpods in. I simply told her no and kept putting away dishes. Now my moms boyfriend and my sister are both mad at me for not forgiving my mom or even acknowledging her apology. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699066313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nc91w/aita_for_refusing_to_accept_my_moms_apology/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Upon her return she yells at you for spending money on feeding your brothers & sister. \n\nBluntly OP, your mother sucks. She is putting her needs & wants above the care and feeding of her children. I am sorry you have a mother like this. She is too immature to have kids, much less five of them.  \n\nPlease try to leave home once you are 18. Start preparing now.

Happy belated birthday & hugs from an internet stranger.", "NTA\n\nSo your mother left her children home with no food and no money and she is pissed at you for taking care of her children for her? Yeah, your mother and her boyfriend are lucky. What they did was most certainly illegal. That's called neglect. If you didn't have that $200 what would have happened to them? That's gross behavior on their part.", "nta. What a horrible way to treat your daughter and of all days on your birthday.  \n\nShe's selfish.

Dude, she is a heifer. \nYou should give her a bill for babysitting for a weekend along with the amount you spent on food. \nIf she pays it, could you forgive her? My guess is she is selfish and sees nothing wrong with her behavior. You are mature enough to know how wrong that is. She is dead wrong for blowing off your plans with her, she didn't even acknowledge she did anything wrong. You can forgive her, dont forget. \nI think she owes you for your time and money that you had to use to feed everyone. I would holdout for that, then consider forgiveness", "NTA.

The initial birthday situation sucks, but I can sorta see both sides, if the shopping trip can be postponed and the boss-sponsored fishing trip can't be.

I'm a mother who's been single for twelve years I have three kids. Never a single time. Would I ever choose a man over them, Especially on such an important day. Wow. And for her to be mad How you spent your own birthday money? Are you kidding me? You could do whatever you want it's your gift!!! If she wanted you to spend it on a specific thing, then she should have bought it herself and then gifted it to you. And how freaking irresponsible to leave a house for a weekend with no food.What she did is called gaslighting.  That's emotional abuse.  Rather than taking responsibility for being a shity a**, mom(at least in this case), She deflects the blame onto you., As if you did something wrong, spending your weekend taking care of your siblings for her. Something that's not your responsibility. If she was actually humble and felt bad and not selfish jerk, She'd walk into that kitchen with a wad of cash to not only cover that $200 but more for watching all the kids. And that guy, he's a jerk, too. He's no good if he's gonna allow that kind of c*** to happen and think it's okay.", "NTA, you did the right thing for your siblings and I am sorry you had to spend your birthday like that. I hope next year is better, happy belated birthday", " Crappy mom. Sounds like mine. You never forget stuff like this. If she continues to be toxic it might be better to go no contact someday, when you can.", "Nta you're mom is a complete inconsiderate b witch who shouldn't have children", "NTA\n\nYour mom abandoned you with your siblings for the weekend with no one to take care of you. She gave you money only for yourself, nothing for your siblings. Call CPS for negligence", "NTA.  Promises should not be broken.  The only excuses are for actual emergencies.", "NTA. If I were her and had this work adjacent trip come up at the last minute I would have:\n\n1. Walked in the house and found you. Said something to the effect of \"I know we have your birthday plans tomorrow, but this work thing came up and I'm so sorry but can we please reschedule the birthday stuff?\" Not just started packing and shrug it off when you brought it up.\n\n2. Actually asked either you or your sister or both if y'all are able to please watch your siblings while I'm gone. \n\n3. Actually looked at the food situation before leaving and tell you what I had planned for meals or what we have that could be made into meals. And if there wasn't enough food, either did a grocery run quick before heading out of town and/or given y'all money to get groceries or take out while I'm gone. \n\n4. If I somehow spaced on the checking the food situation prior to leaving (highly unlikely), I probably would have remembered and/or been told by you when I either called or texted to check in on y'all and see how you were doing when I got to my destination and let you know I made it safe and wasn't de@d in a ditch somewhere. At that point I would have apologized for putting you in that situation and asked you to use the birthday money for food and that I would reimburse you when I got back home.\n\n5. If somehow the food situation didn't get realized earlier and I only found out once I was home, my reaction would have been to thank you for making sure everyone got fed and apologize for my mistake and reimburse you the money. I'd probably even tell you that I'm really proud of you for prioritizing you and your siblings need for food above whatever it is you wanted to do with your birthday money. That it was probably a hard choice to make not knowing if I'd reimburse you. And shows real maturity and caring. \n\nI'm sorry that your mother didn't do any of those things! And that she waited multiple days before giving you an apology. I'm pretty sure it was probably just a half @ssed \"I'm sorry\" and that's it. Real apologies actually acknowledge what it is that you did wrong, genuinely be remorseful and then say what you'll do differently in the future. And even then you can't expect someone to just forgive you on the spot. You have to give them time to really think about it and decide if they can forgive you. And even after forgiveness is given it can take time for the hurt to go away. \n\nA good apology would be something like \"OP can we talk for a minute?\" you say yes and then actually look at each other and are completely focused on this. \"I've really thought about what happened and realized that I made some mistakes. I shouldn't have shrugged off breaking our birthday plans. That was really inconsiderate of me and I'm sorry. I should have asked for y'all to watch your siblings and I 100% should have made sure there was food in the house. You never should have been put in the position of needing to use your birthday money to feed everyone. And the way I reacted when I found out about it...I think I was being defensive because I felt like I messed up, but the things I said and the way I behaved were completely inappropriate. I'm so so sorry. I would really like to still do the birthday hangout if that would be okay. Please think about it and let me know what you decide.\" So if what you got was not even close to this, then I totally understand why you didn't even bother to acknowledge it.", "well. your mother is awful. might as well move out as soon as you are able to in 2 years. you are right to refuse the apology because what she said is way beyond the line.\n\nother mother should be extremely grateful that you took responsibility for *her* job as a mother and feed your little brothers.\n\nEDIT: NTA.", "Thank you sm.

She ditched your plans at the last minute, \n2. couldn't even bother to make sure you and your siblings wouldn't starve, and\n3. when you did the decent thing and used the pathetic consolation money she gave you to feed your siblings, instead of being properly ashamed of her careless and appalling thoughtlessness and making amends to you, she YELLS AT YOU and berates you and talks bad about you to the rest of your family.\n\nThere is so much wrong with your mother's actions, I don't know where to start.

In terms of the weekend, there are women who just do whatever their BF's want no matterhow much others, including their children, get hurt. It sounds like your more is like this.  And it sucks.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and you're not over-reacting.  \n\nFirst, is your dad still in the picture?  If so, would it be good for you to stay with him?  If not, are there grandparents or other relatives you'd want to be with?  It might be nice for you to have a change in scenery.\n\nSecond, you're 16.  In less than two years, depending where you are in your education, you can be out of there.  Start thinking about what you want to do in terms of college or vocatonal training.  What do you want to do so you can support yourself comfortably in your own place or a shared apartment? What do you think you'd enjoy doing? What programs are available?  How hard is it to get in and what is the cost?  Talk to your guidance counselor and start planning ahead. I think that feeling more independent and having a plan will help you feel stronger.\n\nNTA.

It's just another day.", "My MIL decided to have my FIL's memorial on my kid's 16th birthday (her grandchild).  This was less than a couple of weeks after he died and just over a week after his funeral/burial.  \n\nI was told she wanted the funeral ASAP but was later than you would've expected.  We had to travel and I did request of my husband to suggest that perhaps the day before or the day this same kids orthodonist appt to have her braces fitted would be great... but no too hard... couldn't speak up so that appt that she'd been waiting for for ages just got put off for another month.\n\nThen I was told that his memorial was going to be about 3-4 weeks after his funeral... nope a week later.. on her birthday.\n\nSo she had the pleasure of 10+ hours in the car to go there and come home... yep, did it on a day trip... I did not want to stay overnight at all... neither did the kids.. they don't have a relationship really with these grandparents... their choice.\n\nThen the MIL makes some sort of comment along the lines of, 'I hear it's your birthday.'  And that's it.  No Happy Birthday and no present... ever... for her 16th birthday.  I'm still salty about it.  There's a whole raft of stories from this side of the family.  I have nothing to do with them... neither do the kids.", "NTA I want you to hear me very carefully, you are victim of emotional abuse. For your sweet 16 your mom completely left you for the entire weekend, did not leave her kids with groceries, then had the audacity to be mad at you for spending what money she gave you on feeding her kids which you never should've been responsible for in the first place? No, that's wrong. Your feelings are valid.  You're 16 but you are still a child. Her child. She wants to play like she's single. When you finally become of age and move out it'll take years of therapy to undo the emotional abuse you're being forced to endure. You did NOTHING wrong, your mother did. Just because she apologized doesn't mean you have to accept it. Accept it when and if you're ready to. Like I said, you're feelings are valid and YOU matter. If there is somewhere else you can go live like your dad, grandparents, etc that may be an option. If not, leave when you are old enough to and go low contract while you work on yourself. Please consider therapy at that point. It's helpful.", "You should never forgive her. Tell her Boutte to mind his business and tell your sister to defend you or to go to hell", "NTA, your mom is a HUGE AH!  Sorry, sweetheart, and happy birthday \ud83c\udf82", "I'm not your mother ( thankfully) but I am a mum so I just want to say this to you. Happy birthday you amazing beautiful girl. You are so kind and have a wonderful heart. I send you so many hugs. Definitely NTA.", "What was her idea on what you and your brothers should eat? \n\nI mean 200\u20ac for two days for you, your sister and your 3 brothers is a bit much, I mean wtf did you est, but still, she dumped her children on you and ditched you on your birthday so the 200\u20ac she gave you are payment for baby sitting and food, not a present. \n\nJust leave as soon as you can and don't let her use you as free child care", "NTA NTA NTA!!!\n\nFirst, happy birthday! 16 is a very fun age.\n\nSecond, you are a very good big sister for taking care of your younger siblings, and it was very selfless of you to use the money that was supposed to be for a girls day, for them. Your character is amazing.\n\nThird of all, your mother is inexcusable. Her little boyfriend is a joke. It\u2019s okay to go no-contact once you become 18. I know there isn\u2019t much you can do right now but remember to try to take care of yourself and give yourself the love and peace you deserve.", "Let\u2019s assume that this behavior toward you is commonplace instead of a one-off. \n\nYou do realize that you are being abused, correct? This is emotional abuse of a child. Fact. No grey area. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely hard to see from within because it becomes your everyday experience and something you expect, but from the outside the abuse is clear. \n\nAnd there is the whole issue of what some people might assume is child endangerment. Congrats, you now have leverage on mom and her boyfriend - *unfuck yourselves or I go to the police*. \n\nI\u2019d be upset if something isn\u2019t done about this.", "Nta. Get the hell away. Fast and far.", "NTA\nThat\u2019s a crap parent. She should have praised you for putting siblings needs above your birthday and paid you back your birthday money and extra for babysitting them all weekend. Wow!", "Nta\nHappy birthday! \nIm sorry your mom, her bf and your sister are assholes. Dont let them get to you!", "NTA, your mom is emotionally abusing you. I\u2019m so sorry!", "I am so very sorry. Belated happy birthday from an internet strange.", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\nYour mom sucked. That wasn't a you thing, it was a her thing. She broke her promise to you.\nShe left underage kids at home without food or necessary provisions.\nShe called you names.\n\nYou are valid in feeling hurt. She was an asshole.", "NTA all around.

Save up as much money as you can and make sure you get ahold of important papers like birth certificate, social security card (if applicable), and try to get your driver's license or passport to make your future easier!", "\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf68\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89*hugs* sorry parents suck", "Not a huge age for guys though. If OP was a boy, nothing would have been wrong.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.", "What the hell I didn't say that it all... I said if you're a single mom and you can't get out. It's awesome cause it like doesn't ever happen. But she did it with no warning to the kid. She didn't let her know she didn't even ask if she could watch the children and she left with no food. So, yeah, it's deplorable. Did you read the last word I said deplorable."]}
