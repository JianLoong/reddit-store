For my birthday my mom  (37) and I planned to go hang out at the mall and have a girls day. This is something we don't get to due often because she is always busy with work or with my three littel brothers. The night of my birthday/day before our plans, she and her boyfriend (M, 30) who I'll call \"Adam\" come home from work. My mom and Adam imeadilty started packing and so my sister and I asked them what they were doing. \n\nMy mom then told me that they were going out of town for the weekend. Being confused I asked her what she meant because we had plans for over a month to hang out. Adam then told me there boss was paying for everything and they were going on a fishing trip and would be back on Monday.  I am aware that I am a very sensitive person as I imeadilty got upset and wanted to cry, I asked my mom \"What about Saturday\" and she sort of shrugged at me, before going on to say that \"we will go another time\". My sister (F, 17) made a small comment about how it was \"Rude to me\" for her to just up and leave on my birthday. \n\nMy mom offered to stay home but I could tell she was really excited so I told her to go. Before they left she gave me $200 for my brithday present. A few hours after she left my brothers who are still relatively young (ranging from 7-12) began to ask us what was for dinner. My mom hadn't taken anything out or bought groceries; so long story short I spent all my money making sure they ate every day and didn't go hungry. In my mind I couldn't let my brothers be hungry knowing I had money. \n\nWhen my mom and Adam came home a few days later she asked me where all my money went because I made a comment to my sister about being broke already. When I explained to her what happened over the weekend she got very angry; my mom started yelling at me and saying many things along the lines of \"I can't believe your ass spent all that money on food\", \"I can't even look at you get away from me\" and \"You make me actually sick to my stomach\". \n\nMy realshonship with my mom has never been great but that last part really hurt my feelings. I imeadilty went to my room very upset and started crying, I didn't come out for diner due to how upset I was. Due to my thing walls I could hear my mom talking about me to our whole family at diner basically saying she would never give me anything again and how pissed she was. \n\nThe next day when I'm doing the dishes my mom walked into the kitchen and apologized but I was still very upset. So I ignored her, she tapped my shoulder and asked if I had my airpods in. I simply told her no and kept putting away dishes. Now my moms boyfriend and my sister are both mad at me for not forgiving my mom or even acknowledging her apology. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699066313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nc91w/aita_for_refusing_to_accept_my_moms_apology/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your birthday weekend where your mother was going to spend Saturday with you as a girl\u2019s day out. But mom ditches you for a camping trip with her BF. \n\n2. She also dumps your 3 little brothers on you & your sister to care for while she was gone. \n\n3.  She gave you money for your birthday. But no money for feeding your siblings. \n\n4.  Upon her return she yells at you for spending money on feeding your brothers & sister. \n\nBluntly OP, your mother sucks. She is putting her needs & wants above the care and feeding of her children. I am sorry you have a mother like this. She is too immature to have kids, much less five of them.  \n\nPlease try to leave home once you are 18. Start preparing now. Don\u2019t allow your mom to guilt you into becoming a nanny for your siblings.  \n\nNTA. Happy belated birthday & hugs from an internet stranger.", "NTA\n\nSo your mother left her children home with no food and no money and she is pissed at you for taking care of her children for her? Yeah, your mother and her boyfriend are lucky. What they did was most certainly illegal. That's called neglect. If you didn't have that $200 what would have happened to them? That's gross behavior on their part.", "nta. What a horrible way to treat your daughter and of all days on your birthday.  \n\nShe's selfish.  She has failed as a Mom.", "Your mom left you (16F) for 3 days to take care of your younger siblings? WTF?", "Your mom sucks. NTA", "Happy birthday!\n\nWhat your mother did is illegal. ie Child neglect and child abandonment, even with intent to return!\n\nNTA and she's lucky you didn't have to call the police in order to get food for you and the other kids!", "Just for clarification, my mom's work trip was NOT mandatory. She is good friends with her boss and his wife. They're very wealthy middle-aged people, and it was purely a social trip.", "Your mother left two minors in charge of two younger minors for a weekend and didn\u2019t leave enough food? NTA and I hope you have a trusted adult you can reach out to for help because that\u2019s inexcusable behavior, and it sounds to me like it wasn\u2019t the first time\u2026 and may not be the last. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "NTA and she's lucky you didn't call the police for abandonment.  Don't accept insincere apologies.  Don't trust anything she says.  And please spell check in the future.  I hate criticizing spelling but there's so many errors it made it hard to understand what you were saying.", "Nta\n\nYour mother is horrible, she shouldnt be forgiven.\n\nYoure amazing for taking care of your siblings, you and your older sister clearly stepped up. I hope your siblings are on your side and understand you.", "Your mother is a selfish self centered person. She is not the worse mother in the world, but she will never be one of the best. \nShe gave you 200. for your birthday, money you had to use to purchase food for a house full of kids. \nShe yelled at you for using it in an unselfish manner. Dude, she is a heifer. \nYou should give her a bill for babysitting for a weekend along with the amount you spent on food. \nIf she pays it, could you forgive her? My guess is she is selfish and sees nothing wrong with her behavior. You are mature enough to know how wrong that is. She is dead wrong for blowing off your plans with her, she didn't even acknowledge she did anything wrong. You can forgive her, dont forget. \nI think she owes you for your time and money that you had to use to feed everyone. I would holdout for that, then consider forgiveness", "NTA. You are wonderful and deserve better. I hope you had a great birthday.", "NTA. This is some abusive BS.", "NTA, she really cannot think for herself, nor does your sister have a Damm brain. You\u2019re close to being 18, just pack up and leave once you\u2019re 18 and remain low contact unless she amends her ways, an apology is meaningless unless action is taken. She\u2019s selfish, rude and doesn\u2019t deserve to be a mom", "My girlfriend of 7 years has a 16 year old daughter. And there is no way in Hell I would ask my girl to cancel birthday plans she'd made with her daughter just to accommodate me, and there's no way in Hell she'd do so even if I asked. Your mum isn't just an asshole, she's a feral, low life bitch. What's worse is that she's now gaslighting you into thinking you might be in the wrong despite her truly appalling behaviour. Your siblings are lucky to have such a cool sister. \n\nHappy belated birthday.", "NTA. The initial birthday situation sucks, but I can sorta see both sides, if the shopping trip can be postponed and the boss-sponsored fishing trip can't be. But it's horrible that she just left you in charge of the younger kids all weekend without any meal plans, and horrible that she then got mad at you for using your money to feed them! She'd rather you leave a 7 year old to figure out his own meals from whatever's left in the back of the pantry?? You're a great sister and I'm sorry your mom doesn't appreciate that.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm a mother who's been single for twelve years I have three kids. Never a single time. Would I ever choose a man over them, Especially on such an important day. Wow. And for her to be mad How you spent your own birthday money? Are you kidding me? You could do whatever you want it's your gift!!! If she wanted you to spend it on a specific thing, then she should have bought it herself and then gifted it to you. And how freaking irresponsible to leave a house for a weekend with no food. Gross! What she did is called gaslighting.  That's empirically abusive.  Rather than taking responsibility for being a shity a**, mom(at least in this case), She deflects the blame onto you., As if you did something wrong, spending your weekend taking care of your siblings for her. Something that's not your responsibility. She was actually humble and felt bad and not selfish jerk, She don't walk into that kitchen with a wide of cash to not only cover that $200 but more for watching all the kids. And that guy, he's a jerk, too. He's no good if he's gonna allow that kind of c*** to happen and think it's okay.", "NTA, you did the right thing for your siblings and I am sorry you had to spend your birthday like that. I hope next year is better, happy belated birthday", " Crappy mom. Sounds like mine. You never forget stuff like this. If she continues to be toxic it might be better to go no contact someday, when you can.", "Nta you're mom is a complete inconsiderate b witch who shouldn't have children", "NTA\n\nYour mom abandoned you with your siblings for the weekend with no one to take care of you. She gave you money only for yourself, nothing for your siblings. Call CPS for negligence", "NTA.  Promises should not be broken.  The only excuses are for actual emergencies.", "NTA. If I were her and had this work adjacent trip come up at the last minute I would have:\n\n1. Walked in the house and found you. Said something to the effect of \"I know we have your birthday plans tomorrow, but this work thing came up and I'm so sorry but can we please reschedule the birthday stuff?\" Not just started packing and shrug it off when you brought it up.\n\n2. Actually asked either you or your sister or both if y'all are able to please watch your siblings while I'm gone. \n\n3. Actually looked at the food situation before leaving and tell you what I had planned for meals or what we have that could be made into meals. And if there wasn't enough food, either did a grocery run quick before heading out of town and/or given y'all money to get groceries or take out while I'm gone. \n\n4. If I somehow spaced on the checking the food situation prior to leaving (highly unlikely), I probably would have remembered and/or been told by you when I either called or texted to check in on y'all and see how you were doing when I got to my destination and let you know I made it safe and wasn't de@d in a ditch somewhere. At that point I would have apologized for putting you in that situation and asked you to use the birthday money for food and that I would reimburse you when I got back home.\n\n5. If somehow the food situation didn't get realized earlier and I only found out once I was home, my reaction would have been to thank you for making sure everyone got fed and apologize for my mistake and reimburse you the money. I'd probably even tell you that I'm really proud of you for prioritizing you and your siblings need for food above whatever it is you wanted to do with your birthday money. That it was probably a hard choice to make not knowing if I'd reimburse you. And shows real maturity and caring. \n\nI'm sorry that your mother didn't do any of those things! And that she waited multiple days before giving you an apology. I'm pretty sure it was probably just a half @ssed \"I'm sorry\" and that's it. Real apologies actually acknowledge what it is that you did wrong, genuinely be remorseful and then say what you'll do differently in the future. And even then you can't expect someone to just forgive you on the spot. You have to give them time to really think about it and decide if they can forgive you. And even after forgiveness is given it can take time for the hurt to go away. \n\nA good apology would be something like \"OP can we talk for a minute?\" you say yes and then actually look at each other and are completely focused on this. \"I've really thought about what happened and realized that I made some mistakes. I shouldn't have shrugged off breaking our birthday plans. That was really inconsiderate of me and I'm sorry. I should have asked for y'all to watch your siblings and I 100% should have made sure there was food in the house. You never should have been put in the position of needing to use your birthday money to feed everyone. And the way I reacted when I found out about it...I think I was being defensive because I felt like I messed up, but the things I said and the way I behaved were completely inappropriate. I'm so so sorry. I would really like to still do the birthday hangout if that would be okay. Please think about it and let me know what you decide.\" So if what you got was not even close to this, then I totally understand why you didn't even bother to acknowledge it.", "well. your mother is awful. might as well move out as soon as you are able to in 2 years. you are right to refuse the apology because what she said is way beyond the line.\n\nother mother should be extremely grateful that you took responsibility for *her* job as a mother and feed your little brothers.\n\nEDIT: NTA.", "Thank you sm.

Some states let you leave teenagers in charge of youths for multiple days. \nThe thing that is bad is that the mother thought more of her weekend out and not making sure the house was stocked with the food needed.\nThe fact she did not ask the teens before leaving and expecting them to babysit is terrible. \nBlowing off your daughters birthday then gaslighting her to make her feel bad because mom wanted to go camping.", "Abandoning your child on a birthday is cruel. 16 is a huge age for girls.
