After searching for affordable catering, we found a catering company that would not only have us the option of having people served instead of a buffet style (not that that\u2019s bad, but it just wasn\u2019t what we wanted) but had a whole menu that was entirely vegetarian. I\u2019m talking stuffed portobello mushrooms, stuffed peppers, lentils, scalloped potatoes, quinoa pilaf, bread pudding, and a whole lot of other tasty sides. \n\nI am not vegetarian. I do eat fish on occasion, but my fianc\u00e9 is completely vegetarian. We also have several people coming to our wedding from different cultural backgrounds including my fianc\u00e9s Jewish father, our Jewish roommate, and Muslim friends of ours, all of whom have never eaten pork. We also have gluten sensitive friends. And most of all, i don\u2019t want my fianc\u00e9 of all people to have to question the food she is eating on her wedding day, when that\u2019s a problem she struggles with almost every time we go out to eat with friends and family, or go to family functions at other peoples homes. She usually ends up eating chips and guac, or just sides of potatos. She can\u2019t even eat the tortillas my family makes traditionally because it contains lard and that\u2019s \u201cjust how wella made them\u201d. \n\ni had been keeping my mom included in the planning for our wedding, so today I decided to show her the catering company that we had been thinking of. The first thing she asked was \u201cwhat about people who aren\u2019t veggie?\u201d And in response I said \u201cpeople can\u2019t eat veggie for one meal?\u201d And she just got quiet. I again tried to hype up the menu, stating \u201cdoesn\u2019t the menu look good though?\u201d And mentioned everything stated above, and she, again, was silent for a good 10 seconds and said that one of the sides just looked good, and moved on. Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to read my moms emotions, sense she\u2019s not very confrontational, and her mind wanders quite a bit (her words, not mine) so i wasn\u2019t sure if I pissed her off or not. There hasn\u2019t necessarily been any drama surrounding this, but there is already existing drama considering this is a wedding with two brides. And I\u2019m afraid of this decision creating more drama for us to have to deal with. \n\nI thought I was being inclusive to everybody by not serving meat at my wedding, but now I\u2019m second guessing myself. Anybody friend I talk to is going to say what i want to hear. So I\u2019m asking Reddit instead. Even better if you eat meat and find yourself in this situation. Would I be the asshole?\n\nEdit: i am truly not trying to claim my mother is the asshole. Nor did she say anything necessarily bad. She just asked a question. I merely was second guessing my decision because she said something. I was worried it would become a bigger issue.\n\nEdit 2: there is a section on our website that provides people with the option of listing allergies they have so we can plan accordingly. Also, we plan to have the full menu listed on our website, which will also state that it is fully vegetarian.", "created_utc": 1692573359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wq8zf/aita_for_not_serving_meat_at_my_wedding/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have never gone to a catered celebration where I could not find something to eat and I certainly wouldn't be bothered. If I'm hungry, I can grab something in the way home.", "NTA. People eat vegetarian meals literally all the time without blinking. But the minute the menu is vegetarian by someone else\u2019s choice they seem to wig out.

That dynamic where there\u2019s never food for her is horrible.  I would have had some big fights with my family, and refused to come if they weren\u2019t going to make some attempts at including my partner.

Just don't be surprised if someone has a burger in the parking lot or a bit of jerky when no one else is looking.", "NTA. Your menu sounds very tasty.", "NAH\n\nYou are providing a meal that works for everyone and those that are meat eaters can go without for one meal. Your mom was surprised but wasn\u2019t confrontational and if she starts questioning why you are going with this menu point out all the people that wouldn\u2019t be able to eat a \u201ctraditional meaty\u201d dinner. \n\nI\u2019m a big meat eater but the last few weddings I\u2019ve been to have has vegetarian meals and no one has complained.", "NTA.

Like someone else said, pasta is a great option.", "NTA.  I eat meat and I'd be totally cool with a vegetarian wedding menu.  I think it's the most inclusive option.  Now, if it were a vegan menu, I'd have to suggest that maybe some vegetarian dishes could be added.  But like others have said, lots of popular dishes in many cuisines are vegetarian, so I'm not seeing how this is a bone of contention.", "NTA. You're providing food that everyone can eat.  Meat eaters can go without meat for one meal. Don't listen the whiners, if they complain just tell them to shove it. Focus on having a fun day :)", "NTA. If I had two friends/colleagues/family getting married and I knew they were vegetarian and pescatarian, I would think it likely I will eat a vegetarian meal at the wedding. Anyone who can rub their brain cells together and put you above their stomach preferences for one night should be welcome, others can go get a steak, I guess (rare like real carnivores, ofc).\nBefore anyone comes at me in the replies, I happily eat meat, I just also have been blessed with common sense.", "NTA.\n\nThe meat at weddings is never good anyways. You either get cold, slightly overcooked chicken or red meat that is too rare or overdone for your personal taste.\n\nIt always amazes me how stressed couples get planning their wedding food, because I've honestly never had a great meal at a wedding. Your menu sounds great to me. It's an excellent solution to make sure everyone has something they can eat. Except keto folks. But as a keto person myself-I cheat on special occasions. Weddings count :)", "NAH. Serve whatever meal you wish at the wedding. While there will always be guests who complain about the food no matter what, this menu reads like it's inclusive. The omnivores will survive a meal without meat.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice of what food to serve. Plus by making everything vegetarian you're making sure all your guests can eat without a hassle. Your non-vegetarian guests won't die of protein deficiency from eating lentils and mushrooms for one meal. And if they don't want what's being served they can bring their own food.", "Nta", "NTA.  Your wedding so your choice.  People who are unhappy about the menu don\u2019t have to attend.", "NTA. When I told my mom we were having an open bar at my wedding, she asked me why we were having alcohol at all. Well, mom. We planned on having a bunch of firefighters, and they like beer. She never mentioned it again. She was only worried about some relatives, but no one caused an issue. It's your wedding. If you love the menu, who cares?", "NTA. First of all, it's your wedding & you're paying. Also, I'm a meat eater but I know I can make it one night without meat...I won't perish lol. The menu sounds very tasty!", "I eat meat but I'm not gonna cry and shit my pants if ONE MEAL in the day does not have meat. That stuff you mentioned sounds tasty and I would gladly eat it. Don't worry about it.", "NTA, Its your wedding you do what works for you. That being said its the sentiment from all sides of the dietary world. If you do a normal meal but plan to have 1 or 2 maybe 3 dishes for people with some form of dietary restriction some will be fine with the choices because they understand your trying to make it work for everybody, some will whine how it wasn't inclusive enough for them, but most will suck it up say its for 1 night and eat whats in front of them. This goes for any type of meal whether its what us deemed normal, or veggie, or full vegan, etc. I think your mom going quiet is her way of communicating that instead of saying she doesn't like your decision and then having a problem she told you there are some of them that look alright and she can handle it.", "NTA\nBeing vegetarian for one meal won't hurt anyone. \ud83d\ude1c", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. I'm a meat eater and I love the sound of the food on offer at your wedding. I very rarely have any meat but fish in my house though now. My kids regularly ask for vegetarian dishes. We have friends with all sorts of dietary needs, and veggie dishes tend to manage them all.", "NTA. Go for it. People who are not vegetarian eat vegetarian meals all of the time\u2026 Mac and cheese? Pasta with marinara? \n\nIt will help if some of the dishes are easily recognizable like scalloped potatoes. But anyone who would even say anything negative about your wedding food choices is a asshole. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve never had a good piece of meat at a large catered event.", "NTA. I'm on the spectrum and have food sensitivities, there are only a few veggies I eat I can struggle with trying new foods. Would I want to eat anything on your menu? Probably not. But would I let that stop me from going and enjoying your wedding? Absolutely not.\nYou are letting everyone know well ahead of time. If it was me I would be telling you 'hey, not a fan of the food. So I'm going to eat before I get there if that's ok'. Or give people the option to come to the reception a bit later if they don't want to eat your food (hell, this could save you money too)", "NTA. Those dishes sound good and I eat meat. Some people might be a little disappointed there is no meat but they can get over it. Your mom could always offer to pay for meat dishes if she thinks they are that important.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with vegetarian food, especially if it\u2019s yummy! \nFor picky eaters you really can\u2019t go wrong with pasta. Lots of people don\u2019t like mushrooms so I would try to have some type of dish that is generally very approachable and familiar and wouldn\u2019t scream \u201cwe made this vegetarian\u201d- it just happens to be.. ie. fettuccini alfredo or spaghetti with marinara.. penne arrabbiata. I can\u2019t think of too many people that would refuse a simple pasta dish and I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to mention it\u2019s vegetarian.", "NTA. Not their wedding. When it's THEIR wedding they can pick the menu", "NTA. the absolute best way to cater to different food needs is to go vegetarian. Most people happily eat vegetarian as long as it is not pointed out to them! Cheese quesadillas? Tomato soup and grilled cheese? Mac and cheese? Baked potato with sour cream and chives? No one will die without meat for one meal and you don't have to worry about a cultural faux pas. Plus it is cheaper. Your mother maybe was unused to the context but she didn't appear to be too upset. The fact that she said one of the sides looked good seems to indicate that she was not going to make a fuss and was finding the positive in something she is not accustomed to. Your fiancee is vegetarian. Go for it and enjoy your wedding meal. I eat all meats but about 3/4 of my diet is vegetarian.", "I eat meat but lean more toward veggie.  I would be 100% fine with that menu!  My very carnivorous husband would be a bit annoyed but would just eat what he wanted from the plate and we\u2019d stop at McDonalds on the way home.  He wouldn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.  At the end of the day it\u2019s your and your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s wedding.  You are accommodating many different food restrictions in the best way possible.  And you\u2019re right, your fianc\u00e9e should not be worried about what she can and cannot eat at her own wedding.", "NTA and menu sounds great. Just don\u2019t go full send on vegetarian train and do sushi with watermelon instead of tuna. Had that at a wedding once. Woof", "It's YOUR wedding. People who want to opt out of your food can get McDonald's on the way there.", "NTA I love meat. I can live without it for a day. I wouldn\u2019t want anything weird though.", "NTA. As long as I\u2019m invited I\u2019m flattered, and if I leave with a full belly I\u2019m thankful.", "NTA. It's your wedding. You should enjoy it!\n\nAlso: menu honestly sounds delightful from an omnivore. I'd be stoked.", "NTA, I always make sure I get food before I go to my vegans friends activities although they are pretty good with accommodating everyone. (It\u2019s probably be like chicken wings or grilled chicken) I still go feed because I know I don\u2019t really enjoy those food and hate mushrooms and half the food contains it \ud83d\ude2b. \n\nBut I take it that you are probably Hispanic and your mom is probably just thinking about the family and how they will react. Sounds like she\u2019s just processing how she\u2019s gonna brake it to people or deal with the Tias complaints. We are very big carne asada people after all, so for your side it\u2019s probably gonna be a \u201cwtf why what about us? Why we gotta eat monte? \u201d (you know how they are, there is no changing our elders) honestly tho she was  probably just thinking how she can ask you to include it on her own without offending you. \n\nSidenote: Wellas way is always the best way \ud83d\ude02 \nOne time my cousin asked abuelita to make her tortillas with vegan friendly because she missed her tortillas. Grandma replied, \u201cain\u2019t my fault you wanna eat the cows food instead of the cow\u201d she did make them for her tho.", "NTA- It is your wedding, do as you want. My advice to anyone attending a not traditional wedding is not to expect traditional anything. Go with an open mind and enjoy the occasion. You might learn how other people live.", "The sad truth is that, yes, there will be people outraged at being served no meat. Hell, there are even idiots boycotting an entire restaurant chain for the sin of adding a veggie burger to the menu.", "NTA \n\nYour wedding your menu.\n\nAlthough a question- why not include fish options?", "NAH\n\nShe just asked a question.  I don't think she's an asshole.  \n\nAnd you serve what you  want at your event!", "NAH. You're trying to be inclusive to your fiance and guests with dietary needs. \n\nYour mother is probably just balking because serving meat is a traditional \"feasting\" move in Western culture - but most people don't understand why (*celebrating excess and good fortune by essentially sacrificing an animal for meat when it could otherwise provide other products - moreso when multiple meat options are offered). When people don't serve meat, it probably feels wrong to her or perhaps rude/cheap, but she doesn't know why. Make sure she sees how lavish and filling a vegetarian meal can be (*I'm a definite meat eater, but my favorite treats - vegan brownies - are soooooooo rich that it's surprising there's no animal products).\n\nJust make sure people are informed going in so they are not surprised.", "NTA. Just make sure you give your guests a head\u2019s up! Went to a wedding where the couple was vegan and they did a slip in (or tip in as they call it in the marketing biz) that talked about their values and what they held important to them. And they asked that we all gave it a try in honor of them. I learned I absolutely love maple roasted acorn squash with pomegranate seeds and not cashew \u201ccheese\u201d. Lol.", "NAH. It's nice that you are vegetarian, but at the same time, you KNOW most people are not and everyone would expect there to be a non-vegetarian choice at a wedding. If anything, vegetarian is usually the option given where maybe 2 or 3 people get.\n\nBut as long as you give everyone notice about it then you're not an AH. However, expect a LOT less people to go to the wedding. People expect good, and free, food at a wedding and most traditional weddings might have food options. I am of course not a vegetarian, but literally nothing you listed is anything I would like at all. I don't think I am alone in that.\n\nSo while it's your wedding and there are No AHs here, just know many probably won't want to come once they find out that the only option is vegetarian.", "NAH- at the end of the day it\u2019s your wedding, so what you would like. However, I do get people\u2019s point of view that get annoyed when vegetarians expect to be catered to, but won\u2019t cater to people who aren\u2019t vegetarians (not saying you are doing this, but I have heard people say this a lot before)\nLike I said, your wedding, do what you like\nJust a side note, just because something is vegetarian it doesn\u2019t make it kosher does it?", "NTA,\n\nHowever I would ask, is your mom an outlier to your guests or a good representative about their attitudes. You and your fianc\u00e9 are entitled to serve whatever you want. However, if your mom is a good representative, you may want to explore a meat option. Chicken oughta work. Then in the RSVP, which you\u2019ll have to stick to firmly, ask them to select the veggie or chicken option.\n\nAgain, you don\u2019t have to, and you would NBTA if you stick to all veggie, but if your mom\u2019s read of the menu is similar to other guest you\u2019ll still get blow back. You just need to ask, is it worth it?", "NTA as long as you prep people in advance. I know that all sounds amazing to you, but I'm with mom, scalloped potatoes are the only appetizing thing you listed for me. I would definitely make sure I ate beforehand. \n\nYour comment about the meal being inclusive of everyone definitely isn't inclusive of the traditional meat and potatoes American wedding expectations. Which is fine, you can serve whatever you like, but it is good to know that many people don't find vegetarian dishes enjoyable.", "NTA.    I'm a carnivore but  I also love mushrooms, tofu,  and chickpeas and salad. \nMy red meat and 3 veg husband will eat all that.   \n\nIf you get too much hassle, maybe think about a (halal) roast beef and veg.  Otherwise they will survive.\n\n  Has there ever been a wedding anytime ever where all the guests were happy with food.  That's not the point of a wedding.", "NTA - It\u2019s your wedding and should be catered how you want it catered.

After searching for affordable catering, we found a catering company that would not only have us the option of having people served instead of a buffet style (not that that\u2019s bad, but it just wasn\u2019t what we wanted) but had a whole menu that was entirely vegetarian. I\u2019m talking stuffed portobello mushrooms, stuffed peppers, lentils, scalloped potatoes, quinoa pilaf, bread pudding, and a whole lot of other tasty sides. \n\nI am not vegetarian. I do eat fish on occasion, but my fianc\u00e9 is completely vegetarian. We also have several people coming to our wedding from different cultural backgrounds including my fianc\u00e9s Jewish father, our Jewish roommate, and Muslim friends of ours, all of whom have never eaten pork. We also have gluten sensitive friends. And most of all, i don\u2019t want my fianc\u00e9 of all people to have to question the food she is eating on her wedding day, when that\u2019s a problem she struggles with almost every time we go out to eat with friends and family, or go to family functions at other peoples homes. She usually ends up eating chips and guac, or just sides of potatos. She can\u2019t even eat the tortillas my family makes traditionally because it contains lard and that\u2019s \u201cjust how wella made them\u201d. \n\ni had been keeping my mom included in the planning for our wedding, so today I decided to show her the catering company that we had been thinking of.
