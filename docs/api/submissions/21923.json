You never mistreated the dog, you never denied your help in case of emergency. You just don't want a full responsablity for a dog that isn't yours. You did nothing to instigate such a vehement reaction from your partner, so a hunch is telling me that there's another reason why he went suddenly from 0 to 100.", "NTA. I just know that even if you get married to your partner, he will dump all his responsibilities on you.", "I really can't stand when people dangle breaking up with their significant other in arguments. \n\nWhy can't he just take care of his own dog?  You already stated, and proven, that you would help out in a pinch.\n\nWhy did you have to claim it as \"ours\"?  It makes no sense to me. \n\nHe knew your position on this before he moved in, no? So why all of a sudden is that a problem? \n\nI'm sorry but something is simple as claiming ownership over a pet is not something I would ever leave my fiance for. I can't really think of many things I would leave him for. Is there something else going on? So strange. \n\nNTA", "NTA. you explicitly warned him you dont want to take responsobility on something you cant look after due to the current situation yet he still insisted on it. He can hire a dog walker / sitter on his expense if he insists on it", "NTA it's not your dog and the fact that your partner moved in doesn't make you responsible for the dog. You should keep doing the things you described in the post (if he asks, you can occasionally walk the dog, etc), but it shouldn't become a daily duty,because you clearly stated multiple times that you don't want this kind of responsibility at this time. He's trying to convince you to take equal responsibility because it's too much effort and he can't manage all this, imo. But still it's not your dog.", "NTA He sounds manipulative.", "NAH.  But you two are not compatible with each other.  Having a dog (together, not his alone) is what is important to him.  You having as little contact with dog as possible is important to you.\n\nA  similar situation is if a guy wants children someday soon, but the girl is convinced she will never, ever want children.  You can't compromise your way out of that.\n\nNobody is right or wrong.  You each need a new partner though.", "NTA. You're absolutely reasonable. I don't really understand why in his book it's either \"It's our dog\" or \"You want me to get rid of them\"", "NTA if you decide to take equal responsibility for the dog and then break up do you think that there will be any question of whose dog it is then? You can bet they will suddenly be his dog again. \n\nIt's messed up that he's threatening to break up with you over this. How is your relationship in general? Is it possible that he's looking for ways out and is trying to put you in a position of saying no so he can break up with you with a clear conscience? In a stable relationship couples should be able to work through their issues without threatening break up.", "NTA - He's trying to manipulate you into taking responsibility for his dog. In what world is it \"our dog\" or \"get rid of the dog\"? Lots of people have pets that their partner takes no responsibility for, it's not a big deal. I think he's expecting you to capitulate. Call his bluff and see what happens.", "NTA.\n\n>Because if we want to be a family unit then he is a part of that. And a relationship doesn\u2019t work if the dog doesn\u2019t become \u201cours\u201d. \n\nNot actually. My spouse has a dog. It's his dog - he wanted a dog, I didn\u2019t. I sometimes feed the dog and play with it, but he is responsible for buying food, walking it, bathing it, taking it to the vet, etc, etc.\n\nIf your bf is willing to break things off because you won't do an equal amount of dog owner chores, it doesn't sound as though he places much value on your relationship - I'd let him (and his dog) go without any regrets.", "NAH\n\nBoth of you have established what you want from a future together. Bottom line is you want different things. Better to break up now.", "NTA, you said from the beginning you don't want the responsibility and know he is trying you to impose this on you. You are right to stand your ground, even if it means breakup. \n\nIf he had a child before, would he forces you to adopt it ?", "NTA.\n\n>I\u2019ve told my partner a few times over the last 2 years that I don\u2019t want that responsibility. \n\nHe knew your expectations. I'm assuming that he managed when he had sole responsibility for the dog. He should be able to do what he did before.", "NTA he's responsible for his dog.", "NTA\n\nI think it's very manipulative that he's acting like you are telling him to get rid of the dog and responding to that when you haven't said anything like that, you've just said you don't want to take care of the dog. If he was arguing in good faith, neither of you would be assholes, but he's not, he's going to an extreme position to make you feel unreasonable so you'll give in. \n\nMaybe you should break up. From your other responses you seem very stressed and this seems to be adding to it substantially, and his lack of good faith attempts to solve it are crappy.", "How odd that he is making this demand all of a sudden.\n\nIs something else going on and he is looking for an excuse?\n\nHis dog is his responsibility. Though you are quite right to help out when he's stuck.", "NTA. It sounds like you've met him half way, but he's still resenting you. It sounds like he just can't handle his own dog and is blaming you. If he got the dog when he was single hoping he'd find a partner to help him raise it, that's pretty immature. And he's trying to lay down an ultimatum? Fuckin, red flags everywhere.", "NTA. If you use the child analogy, the dog would be a step child rather than one both of you had decided to conceive together. And while I kinda understand what he\u2019s getting at in that it shows where your commitment is, he sounds manipulative af and definitely has some agenda going on. \nMake sure you\u2019re the one responsible for family planning", "NTA...you've been very clear about this boundary. He's trying to strong-arm you by threatening to end the relationship. He may just be using the dog as an excuse. In any case, prepare yourself for the possibilities.", "NTA\n\nHis dog is his responsibility.  If he doesn't like that, your BF is welcome to move out... And take his dog with him.", "NTA, he\u2019s wrong for suddenly throwing it on you like this after knowing your stance all this time. And he\u2019s wrong that relationships can\u2019t work if the dog doesn\u2019t become both of y\u2019all\u2019s. When my boyfriend & I lived together for several years, my dogs still remained mine the whole time. He would help me on occasion when I needed it, but wasn\u2019t expected to do anything beyond that.\n\nSounds like he might just want to shove off some of his responsibilities on you? I can think of any other reason why the dog would HAVE to become both of y\u2019all\u2019s, or else break up. Makes no sense", "NAH\n\nHe should have communicated with you sooner.\n\nBut the same way you don't have to want a dog, he's also in his right to not wanting a relationship where he feels life's not being really shared. He probably thought he could deal with it and later found out he can't.\n\nIt's not fair of him to come out with an ultimatum all of a sudden, but if that's a deal breaker for him you need to respect that and decide if that's also a deal breaker for you or not.", "If you are in a relationship with him and want to progress further you have to accept the fact that the dog is also part of the deal because he thinks his partner will take care of the dog. I get that u don't want responsibility but he also can't abandon his dog, being with him means being with his dog. If you can't accept that it's better to break up.\nNAH fits better.", "Soft ESH. \n\nYou've both committed to each other and are both expecting contrasting things from each other.\nYou've both essentially said what the deal-breaker is, he wants you to take more responsibility for his dog, even though you've \"told him a few times over the last two years that you don't want that responsibility\". \n\nThe only way I can imagine seeing this disagreement working is if one of you does what you don't want to do. Whether it be you take more responsibility (it may be as simple as filling up the dogs food and water bowls) or he comes to the realisation that you're sticking to your words of not wanting that responsibility.\n\nEither way I think him wanting to end the relationship because of it is a bit rough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
