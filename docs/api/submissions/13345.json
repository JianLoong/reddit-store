{"id": 13345, "submission_id": "123vcws", "title": "AITA for demanding my ex girlfriend pays me back for the trip to DisneyWorld I bought her when we were together?", "selftext": "Seven months ago, my (29M) girlfriend (27F, Tara) and I were celebrating our first year together and I had a surprise present for her, a whole trip to DisneyWorld for the two of us. Tara is a big Disney fan and had already visited the park many times but I never went in my life. I was puzzled because after the initial excitement she started looking a little sad so I inquired about it. Tara told me that she had always wanted to go to DisneyWorld with her older sister, explaining that going there was their dream when they were growing up but their dad was mean and never took them. \n\nEven when she was able to go with friends or boyfriends, they never got to go together because Tara's sister was always busy with college or with her husband and children. Tara said that it would be more meaningful of me to give her a trip she could do alone with her sister as a way to fulfill that dream. I got dizzy after this as it sounded strange to me. She had never talked about her dad in a bad way or mentioned anything about this sisterly dream. She calmed me down, talking a lot about how we would have countless opportunities to go to places together in the future. Tara insisted this was the perfect moment to do it with her sister because she was getting divorce and would have more free time. I soon transferred all the tickets and reservations to her so she could organize everything with her sister.\n\nThe issue is that a few weeks after all this, Tara broke up with me. I was blindsided and devastated because I felt that everything was going great between us but ultimately I tried to be strong and move on. I totally forget about the DisneyWorld issue at first and, when I began thinking about it again, decided it would be better to let it go. I didn't want to start a conflict about it and ruin the chances of us remaining friends. Tara started dating another guy very quickly and in less than three months they were engaged. It felt weird to me but I still send her a text congratulating them and she answered me very sweetly. I am a follower of Tara's Instagram Lives  and last week she mentioned that she was going to DisneyWorld with her fianc\u00e9.\n\nI texted her about it and she said that her sister dropped out of the trip because she had to go to a wedding so she was going with her fianc\u00e9 instead. I was very troubled by this and we started an argument. I told her that this was not the deal and that she should paid me back all the money I originally spent of the trip. Tara told me she didn't have to do anything and that I had zero power because everything was under her name. She accused me of being a stalker and blocked me everywhere. I feel really weird after all this because I think I am in the right and what she did was not good but I also may have reacted too strongly and ruined the cordial relationship we had have since the break up.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679940906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123vcws/aita_for_demanding_my_ex_girlfriend_pays_me_back/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's basically stripped you of it and you still kicking yourself. I think you should text the fiance tell him what happened. It doesn't have to be angry or mean. Just lay out the facts.
