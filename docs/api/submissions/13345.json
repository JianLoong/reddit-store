Tara is a big Disney fan and had already visited the park many times but I never went in my life. I was puzzled because after the initial excitement she started looking a little sad so I inquired about it. Tara told me that she had always wanted to go to DisneyWorld with her older sister, explaining that going there was their dream when they were growing up but their dad was mean and never took them. \n\nEven when she was able to go with friends or boyfriends, they never got to go together because Tara's sister was always busy with college or with her husband and children. Tara said that it would be more meaningful of me to give her a trip she could do alone with her sister as a way to fulfill that dream. I got dizzy after this as it sounded strange to me. She had never talked about her dad in a bad way or mentioned anything about this sisterly dream. She calmed me down, talking a lot about how we would have countless opportunities to go to places together in the future. Tara insisted this was the perfect moment to do it with her sister because she was getting divorce and would have more free time. I soon transferred all the tickets and reservations to her so she could organize everything with her sister.\n\nThe issue is that a few weeks after all this, Tara broke up with me. I was blindsided and devastated because I felt that everything was going great between us but ultimately I tried to be strong and move on. I totally forget about the DisneyWorld issue at first and, when I began thinking about it again, decided it would be better to let it go. I didn't want to start a conflict about it and ruin the chances of us remaining friends. Tara started dating another guy very quickly and in less than three months they were engaged. It felt weird to me but I still send her a text congratulating them and she answered me very sweetly. I am a follower of Tara's Instagram Lives  and last week she mentioned that she was going to DisneyWorld with her fianc\u00e9.\n\nI texted her about it and she said that her sister dropped out of the trip because she had to go to a wedding so she was going with her fianc\u00e9 instead. I was very troubled by this and we started an argument. I told her that this was not the deal and that she should paid me back all the money I originally spent of the trip. Tara told me she didn't have to do anything and that I had zero power because everything was under her name. She accused me of being a stalker and blocked me everywhere. I feel really weird after all this because I think I am in the right and what she did was not good but I also may have reacted too strongly and ruined the cordial relationship we had have since the break up.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679940906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123vcws/aita_for_demanding_my_ex_girlfriend_pays_me_back/", "score": 346, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s just a shitty situation. Despite the circumstances, you willingly transferred everything to her. By doing so, you gifted these tickets to her. There was no contract, therefore there were no stipulations, therefore you have no entitlement. She was dead wrong about how it all played out. But the fact that you were ok with her keeping the tickets until you found out she was going with another man makes you TA. Sounds like a bit of jealousy. Sorry that you two didn\u2019t work out,  but you gotta charge those tickets to the game bro\u2026 One of life\u2019s lessons learned the hard way.", "Judge judy should chime in on this", "NTA fuck a cordial relationship. go scorched earth.", "NTA  Companies will allow you to cancel if you are ill.

Sounds like she was already on her way out of the relationship before you planned the trip, so she got you to change everything over to her before she split. Sorry pal, but you have been used.

You aren\u2019t going to like this, but here it is: \nTara was likely cheating on you with this guy when you presented the \u201cDisney Trip\u201d. The reason she appeared upset was because she was likely screwing around with this guy and wanted to go with him instead. She then made up the whole b.s. story about her sister so you would give her the trip and she could take her boyfriend/the other guy. Once the tickets were secured, she no longer needed you and dumped you. I\u2019m sorry, but she was using you and manipulated things to get her way. You didn\u2019t deserve that, and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.\nJust for future reference, when you see someone end a serious relationship and then magically are in a new serious relationship within a week, it\u2019s because they were cheating with that person. When things get serious with their \u201clover\u201d, they\u2019ll dump their original boyfriend/girlfriend and act like they just got together with this new person. \nAgain, I\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but there\u2019s like a 99% chance this is what happened. If you can, try and cancel the tickets or get your money back. If you can\u2019t, just accept your losses and consider this a painful lesson. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll be better off on the future. Again, NTA. Your ex certainly is, though.", "NTA but you are the sucker.", "Well you got played. It hurts and it sucks. High probability sister story is total BS and that she was cheating on you. Definitely NTA. Now is the time to be petty and own it. Contact Disney or the credit card you used to cancel the trip. Even if it means no refund do it. Move any dates you can and transfer any tickets/hotels if possible. Even donate it to a charity if you can't get it back in your name. She used you so any actions you can legally take do so. All else fails file a claim in your local small claims court. Be sure to save any texts, emails and conversations you had with her.", "Dude! NTA- did you pay for this on a credit card? I would do everything in my power to dispute that charge and cancel those tickets! She is evil and you don\u2019t need her as a friend!", "NTA but man you got taken in a bad way.  She was absolutely seeing this other guy while she was seeing you.  She was already looking to break up with you when you offered her the trip.  She lied about her sister, knowing once she had the tickets she could go with this other guy.  Once she had them she waited just long enough to keep you fooled before breaking up with you.\n\nI promise this is how it went down.  Unfortunately you are pretty screwed since you already transferred everything to her.  If you only made a down payment for the trip instead of paying for the whole thing you need to cancel that credit card immediately.  You\u2019re not going to get back the money you spent but take this as an important and expensive lesson.", "Cancel the trip. \n\nYour money is gone either way, but at least she can\u2019t take a vacation with her dude on your dime. \n\nThen block her on everything.", "NTA.

She sounds pretty disgusting. I would let the new guy know he was going on your money.  That she played you to get it. Then let them go and he will soon learn how selfish she can be. She will play him too. Just wait and watch", "NTA but gullible.\n\nNot sure what legal options you may have, but this was probably an expensive life lesson.", "NTA in this scenario, she manipulated and played you for the tickets to go to Disneyland with the guy she was clearly cheating on you with. I really hope you can do or pull some sort of petty revenge on her by canceling the trip and not telling her or somehow getting your money or tickets back and going with someone who's more worth it in your life. Also stop trying to be friends with her, she isn't a friend.", "NTA\n\nbro you got played soooo hard. Personally I'd sue and would deny any notion of it being a gift. \n\nThe absence of evidence is evidence :)", "This.

Certainly seems like she's been lying to you all along.

She scammed you unfortunately, but don't let her get away with it", "NTA SHE IS A EVIL MASTERMIND, she totally planned this. Refund the trip and let her suffer", "NTA\n\nBut you were the rube. She was never going with her sister and she was banging that guy begfore you broke up.\n\nIt sucks, but be glad you aren't marrying her.", "She is a total AH here, but dude, you ran head first into this. Should have gotten the refund day 1 that she broke up with you. Ship has sailed bud, learn from this very valuable lesson. Don't try to do everything to remain friends after a breakup because 99/100 times, it's not going to happen. You deserve better", "You got mickeyed out of a Disney trip by someone who already knew she was gonna break up with you.

That would be the only sweet revenge I could think of.", "I couldn\u2019t IMAGINE still going on a crazy expensive trip that someone else bought me after we broke up.

You usually have 90 days to dispute a charge and the tickets weren't purchased fraudulently.", "Cancel the booking anyway.

You made the decision to gift it all to her instead a trip for the two of you. You could have very easily said no. But you said yes and you were accepted it.

The timing is suspicious and even her reasoning about wanting to bring her sister feels very week in my opinion. \n\nAs far as getting the trip cancelled - I would recommend calling customer service and explaining the situation. Just because her name is on the ticket doesn't necessarily mean it isn't tied to your account and/or credit card. The other option is you could file a fraud claim with your card.", "NTA. Go to your bank and see if you can get the charges reversed and the tickets cancelled as they were stolen by false pretences (unlikely to succeed but worth a try).\n\nIf people ask why she's blocked you on everything or not friends anymore (if you shared the same friend group) tell them the truth.\n\nAsk her sister too. Sister likely got screwed out of the trip too if she knew about it to begin with.", "This is the way", "That's for sure. What self respecting man would accept a trip from her fianc\u00e9 ex Bf?"]}
