Three months ago, my sister (23f), moved in with us, because she broke up with her long term boyfriend, who kicked her out of his house. \n\nI knew my sister was smoking, and we don't, so we set the rule that she smokes only outside the house. I want to clarify that even though we tried to explain to her how it's unhealthy to smoke pregnant, she disagreed, and I can't do anything about it. \n\nAlso, she was always against our cat, asked me to leave him at our parent's when she's here, because she's scared the baby will develop a fur allergy. I said nothing about this, I don't know how this works, we agreed on not letting the cat inside her room, but refused to just put him to my parents. \n\nWe caught her smoking 1-2 times in the house,  and after arguing, we let it slide. But yesterday, when I was walking home, I saw Julian on the streets! Turns out, my sister put him outside. I told her this was the final straw, and she has one month to pack her stuff and find a new place. She said I was overreacting, but Julian was always an indoor cat, he could've been attacked by an animal, or hit by a car, or something. She even said that she wanted to smoke but didn't want the cat to inhale the smoke, which was obviously a lie because she already smoked next to the cat a few times even if we told her not to.\n\nMy sister told my parents that I kicked her out and they're furious at me. I told them they can take her in then, but they don't have a spare room in their new home. She's been crying every few hours about how she's going to be homeless and stuff. I feel bad for her but I don't want to lose my cat or smell smoke in my own home.", "created_utc": 1691998666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qnuwz/aita_for_kicking_my_pregnant_sister_out/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One, how is she worried about her baby's allergies, and she's *SMOKING*? And two, just because she's pregnant or family or whatever doesn't mean she can stay in your place living by her own rules.\n\nAlso, tell your parents to either get over it or give her their bed.", "NTA. You were asking very little of her. If she didn\u2019t want to be homeless, all she needed to do was to respect the rules of your home. \n\nYour parents may not have a spare room, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have a couch or space for an air mattress.", "Yeah NTA you allowed your sister to move in with you and she tried to get rid of your cat\n\nI'm going to guess the actual reason why your parents don't want to take her in is because they don't want to deal with her bullshit", "NTA. Your parents are pissed because they know what she's like, since they are the ones who (poorly) raised her and they don't want to deal with her.", "NTA! She's being disrespectful by not only smoking in your house which I know how annoying that can be but also putting your fur baby in danger. I wouldn't have contact with someone if they did that to my cat.", "NTA. You set reasonable boundaries and did your part that you agreed to as well (i.e. keeping the cat out of her room). I assume you\u2019re not charging her rent either? You were gracious, and patient, and she chose to take advantage of that.", "NTA. If your sister wanted to stay in your home, she could have followed your simple rules. That includes treating your feline family member with respectful tolerance.", "NTA. Your house, your rules, and your cat.", "NTA if she doesn't kicked your cat out of your own house first she will still welcome in house. If she thinks cat is bad for newborn baby she should stop smoking too.", "NTA. She needs to go immediately. You. Cant trust her with Julian", "NTA. Your sister is concerned about the unborn fetus developing a cat allergy but smokes cigarettes while pregnant? That sounds like an impulsive and poorly thought out attempt/response to a situation in which she tries to manipulate you to abide by her ways.", "NTA\n\nShe can contaminate their house with carcinogens and abuse their pets, if they're so worried about it.", "NTA let your parents deal with their poor parenting. Theres a reason the ex didnt want nothing to do with her", "NTA\n\nYour sister brought this on herself be disrespecting the generous boundaries you set. She is incredibly selfish and cruel, and it is time she learned a lesson.", "NTA - if she was so worried about being homeless she should have been a more respectful guest. just because your pregnant and going through a tough time does not give you a free pass to abuse a house cat. that house was the cat home, not the sisters. hope your cat is doing okay.", "NTA. Your house - your rules. Not only did she break them but she put your cat in danger. It was just luck that you happened to see him. And who smokes inside, especially in someone else\u2019s home? I\u2019m a smoker and I\u2019d never smoke inside, it\u2019s disgusting.", "What's this? \n\nThe consequences of my actions? \n\nOh nooo!\n\nNTA, obviously.\n\nShe wanted the cat to die because she is an entitled person. She doesn't care about her baby either, since she smokes. If she cared, she would try to cut down at least ( a friend of mine went from 20-40 smokes a day to 1-2 during pregnancy and I always tell her that this made a difference ). \n\nHer parents don't have a spare room? So, how many rooms do they have? Any room is a spare room when the poor daughter with a baby needs a room, right? They have a kitchen, living room and a master bedroom, I would assume. If they have one more room, they have a room for her, simple as that.", "NTA. \n\nI know a woman who smoked during pregnancy (because she is an idiot and alyo choose to know everything better) and the poor child has livelong health conditions because of that (she will have to getopen surgeries on the heartthpughouther life, and will never be allowed to do sports throughout her life). That she even ignores that is very telling.m about her. \n\nShe is a guest. She should have a little bit of respect for your house. It is obvious she wanted to get rid of your cat.

I am right now in the process of \"torturing\" my cat because I want him to be able to go outside on a leash/harness, he goes nuts when he is leashed or put outside, so now he is wearing a leash inside the house until he realizes it's not going to hurt him and his lordship is offended and cold towards us because we're cruel fucks. Outside safety of an indoor cat is so important it's literally the reason people like me insist on harnesses, which so many cats hate and act like they're being tortured. \n\n(Yeah, harness is super loose so he can get used to it. He refuses to stay in other rooms when he is moved when I try to smoke at least further away from him and put him in one room of the house smoking is prohibited, he insist on being where he wants, which is near my butt. Closed doors are an unforgivable offense and if I could quit smoking, I would, just for him, but you live in constant pain and legally take morphine and still can barely move and then you judge me).\n\nEven if she kicked Julian out because she found out about toxoplasmosis - smoking cuts it all off. You're smoking while pregnant? You don't get to argue what is and isn't healthy for your baby. NTA. If they're so sorry for her, they should take her in. Simple. Like the abortion argument. Of course it shouldn't be treated like anticonception for morons, but if you want to outlaw all abortion, at least take the kid. Oh, it would ruin your life and you can't afford it? Welcome to reality of the parent.", "NTA.  Your home, your rules and your sister broke the rules.  Let her stay with your parents ( assuming they have a sofa for your sister to sleep on).

You allowed her to stay . You gave her shelter and she became disrespectful and broke the house  rules by smoking lets not forget she is pregnant. She tried to get rid of  ur cat.

Really. It is not the only reason, sure, but the children with the least allergies are those who grew up on a farm, especially when the pregnant mother worked in the stables.\n\nAnyway if she would have done something like that with my cat I wouldn't have given her a month.

Change the locks. Give Julian treats and cuddles.", "NTA. \nYour house, your rules. She is just a guest because you took her in. \n\nBut I would really like to know why her longterm boyfriend kicked her out being pregnant.
