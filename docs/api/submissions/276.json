The detour was very small and not hard but she wasn\u2019t used to that and blames me for all the abuse and stress it then caused her to have.\n\nThe title sounds insane right..? well i need to know if i (21 M) was an asshole as she said i was.\n\nSo we planned to go to a drive in movie which was in the next town. My gf passed her driving test a month or so ago so i guess she\u2019s still new to driving but she\u2019s driven around big busy cities and on motorways already so she is confident. \n\nAnyways, at the bottom of my road they are doing road works and completely blocked off the normal route to my house. This happens to be the main route she knows to mine and somehow the only one even though she has been in my town loads. The detour is super small and not hard. Essentially she came to these road works and then had a nightmare trying to get to mine due to them (driving up wrong way up roads and bus lanes and apparently some man having a go at her) \n\nShe did make it to mine though, but was clearly distressed and upset. She immediately went mental and i mean mental at me. Saying i should have told her there was roadworks and that all this is my fault. In my head i was like wtf - i\u2019ve planned this whole day, ive just got in the car and she\u2019s going mental already. i was a bit taken back but i said sorry and accepted it and tried to reassure her.\n\nShe remained to argue and stay in a mood for the next hour and not talk to me (whilst also going mental about how shit the roads are in my town and shouting at me) I understand that she was clearly distressed and said sorry even tho i didn\u2019t think much of the roadworks. My view is that she is an adult and rlly she\u2019s massively overreacted to this.\n\nEdit: I also even offered to drive to the drive in so she could chill out but this made her more angry.\n\nRANDOM Info: wee bit more random info but this led to us breaking up - she has a history of overreacting and being emotionally immature/unstable. Not being able to resolve simple/silly fallouts fast was an issue.

She's an adult and it's not like you were doing the roadworks personally. In the era of Google maps, she doesn't have a leg to stand on", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend is clearly not a confident driver though. The last thing you do is panic and start driving around aimlessly when your route is changed. Let alone driving the wrong way up a road. You pull over, open google maps and enter the address so you can be guided to a new route.", "NTA \n\nI'm not the road service alert system, and neither are you.  If she can't handle a road closure, maybe she's not quite ready for adult driving. She might like go-karts. They have predictable routes.", "NTA\n\nRoad construction is everywhere, it's just part of being a driver and you deal with it. As she's a new driver this sounds like her first time really encountering it and she messed up by not being able to follow the signs properly. That is not your fault at all and her going off on your for a full hour is uncalled for. Sorry you broke up, but sounds like it was for the best.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA, while a heads up would have been nice it just sounds like it was stressful and shook her up a bit, I don\u2019t wanna make assumptions but I imagine she came in with a mental plan and when it didn\u2019t stay that way she was thrown for a loop and then it was thing after thing to shake her up, I\u2019d sit down and ask about it and maybe determine the best way to go about this in the future", "NTA, she's not a confident driver, give her a heads up next time there's something like this happening in the future.  \nPlease calmly talk to her about how her being so angry made you feel and how you don't want to get yelled at for ages for an oversight like this. You didn't know you that she needed to know, you do now.  \nOr break up, whatever you want to do. I wouldn't accept this on a regular basis and I wouldn't go on a date with someone while they were angry at me.", "ESH, less for yourself IMO.\n\nYou knew that she takes that route and you *could* have warned her about it, there was likely other routes she could have taken to avoid that road and saved her a little bit of time/frustration.\n\nOn the flip side, it seems like a huge overreaction to flip out that much over being stuck in some roadworks. It wouldn't have cost her hours to get through, it's something all road users dislike and have to suck up and deal with. Although you could have warned her that did not warrant such an extreme reaction from her, even after apologising to her multiple times.", "NAH it's just a bit of panic", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was understandable to be upset at first but to go mental, shout at me, blame me for it and not accept my apology etc was not on."]}
