So really, who cares?", "Unless you think someone else re-uploaded them without her consent, then don't say anything. NAH", "Info: the pics were posted from her main account and not someone pretending to be her?no chance she has been hacked at all?", "NTA\n\nI would mention that someone can easily reverse image search her other photos just for safety reasons as someone can easily find out where you live and work from social media.\n\nIf she does advertise her OF on both of the socials though, I wouldn't really say anything. But it seems like she probably doesn't since she uses a different name, so a heads up would be appreciated if I was in her position.", "NAH\n\nBut stay well out of it please, no good will come of it for anyone\n\nThere is literally no good that can come from telling her", "Wait she has an Only Fans account???  Sounds like she is posting nudes maybe not publicly but certainly for paying customers.  I wouldn't bother tell her.", "NAH. Ask her if these are intentional accounts, because they didn't seem in character and you just thought you should check to make sure in case she wasn't aware.", "YTA - what do you hope to gain by telling her? This nebulous \"can be reverse searched\" BS still doesn't give a good reason. If she's posting nudes online, she's probably already aware of these things.\n\nYou sound like trying to white-knight save her or something. Stay in your lane.", "YTA;  So your friend has an onlyfans most likely is promoting it on reddit.  Revenge porn and hacking is possible but if there is an onlyfans setup under her name, someone went through the trouble including setting up banking and other details.\n\nShe may have been a little careless with her identity but stay out of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
