I am systems engineer and my wife was an RN. I still work part time/contract but less than 20h/week and my wife is fully retired. We are very fugal people and try to save where we can. I\u2019ve also made it clear to my wife to never tell my family we have money and to pretend that we are dead broke. Her family knows we do well but they never ask for money. My family won\u2019t stop asking for money.\n\nMy mom, dad and brother are terrible with money. My dad and brother both work oil and gas which results in a few fat years of tons of money coming in followed up with lay offs. Not saying the lay offs are their fault but they have never save anything so they run up credit cards to pay for everything. My parents have borrowed against their house so many times they effectively haven\u2019t paid anything towards the principle and they have had that house for 35 years. They should be retired by cant and my dad recently had to go back to work as a school bus driver because they have so much debt and no money. My brother inherited their spending issues and has his own alcohol struggles. He\u2019s currently going through his second divorce.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell my son not to tell his grandparents we recently retired. And they found out from him recently and have been calling me livid because we pretended we were broke for years. But clearly if we can retire we have savings. I didn\u2019t tell them because I know the results are they would just ask as for money constantly. They have on several occasions when we went on vacation and they found out via facebook(we have since learned not to post). And came knocking for money. We lied and told them we won some money but had spent it all on the vacation. \n\nAm I obligated to help them? I don\u2019t feel so because both my parents and brother made lots over their career but my dad is in his 70s and still working. I\u2019m sure they are contacting me to ask for money but AITA if I continue to pretend I have none (not sure how I\u2019m going to that now that they know we are semi retired.", "created_utc": 1689796828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15458w1/aita_for_pretending_i_dont_have_money_so_my/", "score": 7829, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can say that you should have communicated clearly that you dont want to share that information instead of misleading them. You can tell them you wanted to avoid conflict by having to say no to giving them money, or having to say no to discussing finances. That you did not see a need for them to know, and still dont, as it is not a subject open for discussion. You are willing to give them a chance to know and still refrain from commenting on your financial state or ask for money. That will be your new boundary; dont ask, dont comment. If they want your help concerning money, they can ask you to help them set a budget for themselves and give tips on how to live frugally - you are willing to share that.\n\nIt is always better to communicate clearly, say your boundaries and enforce them, instead of lying.

It's easy for people to look at what you have and not consider all that you are responsible for each day. You mention a wife and a son and you may have other children. So while 3 million in assets on top of a house sounds like a lot, Spread out over 30 plus years for two people with multiple dependents and  possibly a couple of expensive life events (wedding, college, home health care, etc) I can see why you would want to shut down any requests for funding from family.  So objectively you are NTA for not giving away your savings.\n\nThat being said you've decided to hide it and deny it. So there is a dishonesty piece here. In a perfect world you could explain to your family that you have what you believe is enough for you and yours and are not in a position to lend large sums of money. If I were you, I would feel more comfortable giving gifts than loans. Maybe you won't loan somebody 25,000 but you'll give them a $2,500 gift if they're in a bind or if it could help change their trajectory by getting them into a school or trade.  I don't think it's any of their business exactly how much money you have. But if you could be honest that you funded your retirement, your family could look to you to provide them counsel on how to invest, pay down a mortgage, navigate career changes or any of the many challenges that you've likely had to navigate in your own life in order to achieve this level of financial security.", "NTA for not giving them cash, but consider buying grocery store gift cards for them (at a place that doesn't sell alcohol) so you can say you're helping while knowing your money isn't being blown.", "As another commenter said, that money is for you and your wife\u2019s retirement.

You don't have to disclose your financial situation, but it's not sustainable (or ethical) for you to flat-out lie to your family either. You have the right to simply not respond if you're asked personal financial information, and to say \"no\" to requests for money.\n\nRegarding your parents - working in your 70's isn't awful if you're in good health (my tennis instructor is 83, and I have an uncle working for TSA at age 77 - both LOVE it).

It doesn't seem it wouldn't be beneficial to give them money as it would be a waste, however you could offer to buy their house from them so they only have their bills to pay and then  you also have a property for future years as an investment.  To me that seems a way of helping but also not giving away your hard earned money.\n\nForget your brother he can sort himself out but I'd certainly want to help my parents out in their later lives if they needed it - but again that's very dependent on your relationship with them.", "NTA, but you may consider telling them the truth at some point, if only for your own conscience. it sounds like your family already suspects you do well for yourself, so at this point, being cagey is only giving them more reason to resent you. I think everyone in this situation would benefit from an honest discussion with parents that they can reiterate to your brother that you may do well for yourself, but you are in no position to help anyone else with their debt or personal finances, which is the truth. No matter how much you have in savings, if you spent it all on them, you'd be broke too.  \n\n\n You know your family best, but being up front and setting a clear boundary will at least give YOU closure that you did everything you could.", "Children should not have to help their parents.\n\nWhenever the argument of \"well, they took care of you for your first 18 or so years\" comes up, my response is \"no shit, that's literally their job.\"\n\nYou choose to create a person.

Those were times you should have set boundaries and been clear rather than hiding and lying. I think you are a dick but a dick with good reason because you would have been taken advantage of or ruined relationships. I mean you basically just defferred ruining it and years of lying will probably make it unrepairable since you proved that you do not trust your family at all.

I am systems engineer and my wife was an RN. I still work part time/contract but less than 20h/week and my wife is fully retired. We are very fugal people and try to save where we can. I\u2019ve also made it clear to my wife to never tell my family we have money and to pretend that we are dead broke. Her family knows we do well but they never ask for money. My family won\u2019t stop asking for money.\n\nMy mom, dad and brother are terrible with money. My dad and brother both work oil and gas which results in a few fat years of tons of money coming in followed up with lay offs. Not saying the lay offs are their fault but they have never save anything so they run up credit cards to pay for everything. My parents have borrowed against their house so many times they effectively haven\u2019t paid anything towards the principle and they have had that house for 35 years. They should be retired by cant and my dad recently had to go back to work as a school bus driver because they have so much debt and no money. My brother inherited their spending issues and has his own alcohol struggles. He\u2019s currently going through his second divorce.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell my son not to tell his grandparents we recently retired. And they found out from him recently and have been calling me livid because we pretended we were broke for years. My wife cuts my hair so I looked like I can\u2019t even afford a barber. I didn\u2019t tell them because I know the results are they would just ask as for money constantly. They have on several occasions when we went on vacation and they found out via facebook(we have since learned not to post). And came knocking for money. We lied and told them we won some money but had spent it all on the vacation. \n\nAm I obligated to help them? I don\u2019t feel so because both my parents and brother made lots over their career but my dad is in his 70s and still working. I\u2019m sure they are contacting me to ask for money but AITA if I continue to pretend I have none (not sure how I\u2019m going to that now that they know we are semi retired.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You have both retired, so the money you have is all the money you will get. And 51 and 52 is YOUNG for retirement. You might actually run out of money. You likely won't, because you say you are frugal, and I believe you. But a finance professor of mine once gave us a personal finance presentation. He said you should assume you will live another 25 years after retirement (and that is assuming a STANDARD retirement age, so probably close to 65 - estimating life span at 90) and will spend ~$100,000/year in retirement. So, he suggested you should have 2.5 million at retirement. You say you have $4 million, but 1/4 of that is just the value of the house you live in. It's not liquid. So, you really only have $3 million. That only gives you 30 years before you run out of money. You retired early - basically at 50. So you will have another decade to go by the time you run out of money. At that point, you'll have to sell your house just to get by. I don't actually think this is how it will shake out, because you said you are frugal, and I believe you, so you will likely get on fine for less than $100,000/year and stretch that $3 million beyond 30 years.
