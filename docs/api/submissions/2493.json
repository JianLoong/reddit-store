My mother was a single parent for me and my sister, and she struggled a lot. She's been disabled her entire life, and as a result she also suffers from depression. \n\nAll this to say, growing up the house was very often not clean. She didn't often have the energy to clean, and with two kids I understand it was incredibly difficult to keep a tidy home. But it went quite a bit past that point. Most of the time there was rotting food in the fridge, piles of dishes in the kitchen and plates littered around the house.\n\nI need to make clear that I completely understand struggling to find the mental and physical energy to clean, but when it gets to the point of being hazardous to your health, I draw the line.\n\n\nI graduated from university last year, and I have done very well for myself. Put simply, I have enough money to buy my mom and sister a house, and take care of bills and mortgage payments for the rest of my mother's life.\n\nYesterday, I sat down with her and told her that I would love to be able to provide for her, on one condition. I said that until my sister moves out, I will be expecting her to update me on the condition of the house, and if it gets as bad as any of the houses we grew up in, I will evict her. She's retired, and with me taking care of mortgage and bills the only thing she would need to spend money on is food and leisure, so she is absolutely financially able to afford a cleaner.\n\nShe laughed a little, and I stressed that I was not joking. I wasn't going to buy her a house she wasn't going to look after. She started getting angry with me, asking me where she was supposed to live if I kicked her out, and where my sister would go. I explained to her that I'm not kicking her out, I haven't even bought the house yet, I'm just making her aware that I won't let another one of her homes fall into disrepair. I also said that I'd figure something out for my sister, separately if need be.\n\nShes calling me a manipulater, saying that I only want to buy her a house so I can bully her, and that I don't understand what it's like to be disabled. \n\n\nMy sister agrees with me, but I just need outside opinions on whether or not I'm being too harsh.", "created_utc": 1668629380, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx4n0y/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_will_evict_her/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're essentially giving your mother and sister a free ride *and* you're advising them on how to make their new living arrangements later be retained in good shape. I would think it would be any parent's dream that their children would be so successful they'd be willing to caretake for them in such a generous manner.\n\nIt sounds like she only wanted to focus on the negative aspect of it, specifically that she wasn't able to clean or keep things tidy due to her condition. I think you might want to talk to her again about it and highlight the positive aspects of the plan so that she can realize this is a positive move for her, rather than a criticism of her. \n\nI actually had a recent miscommunication similar to this with my girlfriend; once I was able to explain how things being cleaned up and organized would help resolve some of the usual misplaced necessities, she realized it was helpful.
