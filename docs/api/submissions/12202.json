And I am considered one of her kids.   \nShe calls him if there is rain forecasted to make sure we are safe and okay. If I'm not with him, she wonders where I am and how I am. If she ever figured out technology, I would probably cave to her because she is just anxious and loves her babies and she's not a snooper. I am sure she would literally just look to see if we were in a flood zone when her anxiety peeks.  \nIt all just depends on your relationship with them and your feelings. Either way, your boundaries are your boundaries and your family needs to respect them. They can flux and flow as time goes on. You can add her and delete her, never add her, add her later, or whatever feels good. It's all up to you and what you feel is healthy for you.", "NTA.  Nope.  Not happening.  I will not have people stalk me for their pleasure.  If she can\u2019t trust you that you are safe on your own, she needs counseling.  Tell your spouse it\u2019s not happening and make sure your phone is password protected.  The simple response to her is that us only for my spouse.. no one else needs to know where I am.", "I think it makes her feel better. Like having everyone\u2019s location will magically make everyone safe. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s malicious, but it sure is uncomfortable and obnoxious. I said it earlier too I think, but it\u2019s the principal of not having to share my location as I am an adult.", "I do share my location with some close friends. Kind is residual from college days when we wanted to see where the party was. I don\u2019t care if my partner and their mom follow each other, that\u2019s up to them. I DO care when someone feels entitled to my privacy. I like my in laws, I do, they are good people, but just have no business needing to know where I am. Even if it just for peace of mind or curiosity or whatever it is\u2026", "I do share my location with some close friends and my partner. I share it for a multitude of reason and it\u2019s different for each person and we both mutually agreed to share. Any time we don\u2019t want to share anymore one or the other turns off the sharing capabilities.\nI understand that it eases my MILs \u201canxiety\u201d about safety, however I don\u2019t ever think someone has the entitlement to my privacy. Especially as an adult and especially since it\u2019s not my actual mother.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious though, some reason I share my location at all is with people who are 1. People I travel locally/internationally with and we just never stopped sharing since we travel together frequently, 2. Local friends for convenience of saying \u201chey meet me at ___\u201d and I can see where they are and 3. My partner for any time we are going to and from work or an event to see ETA.\n\nI don\u2019t think her intent is malicious. It\u2019s mainly the respect of my privacy and the respect of my no.", "Did you bug my house? This sounds about exactly right. Usually that will stall the conversation until MIL asks again and I have to start over.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s malicious, but god it is annoying. Im hoping as time goes on, she realizes that having me and her adult children\u2019s location is weird and stops bothering me.", "It is not \"protection\". You and your husband are adults. You do not need MIL to \"protect\" you. I'm not sure how MIL having your phone location could really be \"protecting\" you anyway.\n\nShe may feel it is coming from a place of \"love\", but it sounds more like it comes from a place of anxiety and and inability to let her children live independent, adult lives.\n\nIf so, it is 100% for her sake, not for yours or any of her kids.\n\nYou don't say her age, but she is likely in her 50s or 60s (if not edging into her 70s). As someone who is at the low end of that age range (with teens of my own), I can firmly say she should know that such tracking is not necessary. Such tracking wasn't even possible when she was your age, much less a teen. The world was not a dumpster fire without it.\n\nNot all technology is good. There are circumstances where such tracking can be useful. But useful in some circumstances does not equal appropriate all the time.", "\"But it will give my Mom anxiety if she doesn't have your location.\" - it's up to your MIL to manage her own anxiety, which she can do by going to a therapist if it's really that bad.\n\n\"Just give it to her to keep the peace\" - that's a loser argument, if you give into it once, it's just a reason to come at you with additional things \"just to keep the peace\" and before you know it, you're living someone else's life, not your own.\n\nIt's up to your MIL to keep her own peace.", "It's not loving. It's controlling.", "Please don't hate being a person with principles. It's a good thing to have a moral compas and use it to guide your actions. If you think someone is intrusive, controlling, and nosy, you absolutely do NOT have to allow it to happen so that someone else's mind has peace. Why does your husband think it's better for his mother to be happy than for you to be happy?", "See, this is part of the problem; even you're buying in to the idea that 'privacy' equates to 'being sneaky' or 'having something to hide.'", "I wasn\u2019t insinuating the relationship would or even could over this, just that boundaries (even small ones) should be respected. MIL isn\u2019t respecting you by not accepting your answer.", ">They don\u2019t mind it, which is part of the issue. \n\nActually, deep down you do mind it.   You may not be able to articulate why to their satisfaction but it definitely bothers you.  Your instincts are spot on.   And really, your partner should have turned it off the moment you married.    The fact that they keep bringing it up is not a good sign.  Go back to NO and leave it at that.", "I understand! My in-laws genuinely meant no harm by it, they\u2019re just kinda odd ducks who don\u2019t get out much and would spend a lot of time watching their kids\u2019 locations. FiL in particular presents as neurodivergent and tends to hyper-fixate on odd things \ud83e\udd23\n\nIf it helps we have a compromise now- when we\u2019re making a long trip we turn it on for their peace of mind, then turn it off after. I also text them personally to tell them a departure and ETA when they\u2019re expecting us.", ">I don\u2019t think she\u2019s using it to try and control where I go,\n\nNo, she use it as part of a pattern to see that her kids prioritize what she wants rather than letting them lead independent lives.  They all think that making her feel  \"better\" should always be a part of any action.  Her children have been trained to believe that her feelings about anything trump their own feelings.   She sees them as extensions of her and they see themselves that way too.  It's not \"malicious\", it's insidious and something you will need to be prepared to push back in a lot of different ways if you want to have a marriage that is satisfying for you -- not for your MIL, but for you.", "Focusing on making your MIL feel better is a text book factor in unhappy marriages.   Your spouse should be focused on making *you* feel better.  It this case, that means no location sharing.", "She is late 50s. And all of her children are in their mid to late 20s. They are a very close family and they don\u2019t mind sharing everything with each other.\nI think something that tipped it off was my MIL\u2019s sister started doing Life360 on her teenage daughters and it turned into a whole ordeal of the daughter sneaking out, etc. I think that freaked out my MIL or something. I don\u2019t know.\nBut even my partner told his mom that the aunt was being overbearing, so I think it\u2019s odd they change their tune when it comes to their own mother.", "That\u2019s totally fair. I guess I figure there\u2019s no reason to demand my location unless you don\u2019t trust me. I\u2019ve always thought of \u201cprivacy\u201d one thing in my life I can have to myself. If you need to know what I\u2019m doing and where I am, I think it\u2019s because you feel I\u2019m untrustworthy. If that makes any sense", "Okay thank you. I started feeling kind of overwhelmed with everyone saying it was malicious. They aren\u2019t like that. Yes it\u2019s uncomfortable and yes they should respect me. I feel like it\u2019s more of a \u201cit shows I care\u201d kind of mindset. But I disagree with that.\n\nI like that compromise. That\u2019s similar to what I do with my parents (which is rarely ever).", "TBH, the nest sounds a bit toxic that everyone (OP included) accepts as normal.  It's similar to living in a house with a carbon monoxide leak that's imperceptible until people start getting sick.   The OP has always had fresh air and their spouse wants to retain the toxic bond.", "For sure! Good luck OP :)", "Oh!  That reminds me I needed to buy some 9volts"]}
