That's not how it's supposed to be.  You two aren't children now.  If she won't behave like a parent of adults, you will have to take adulthood for yourselves, which means taking her control over you away from her.  And not giving her more control.\n\n**There's nothing petty about this.**  What MIL is looking for here is control over your life, because you are involved with her grown child and she wants control over their life.  This is just one way for her to get control, by getting information.  To a manipulator like your MIL, information is necessary to get control over your lives.  If she knows where you are, she can use that information to force your compliance with thousands of requests, demands, objections, blame, and more.  It's a pathway to all kinds of abuses from MIL, to control your lives.\n\n**This isn't petty.**  It's a step towards compliance to MIL's demands.  Her demands aren't reasonable or polite or respectful to you.  Her demand is invasive, takes away your autonomy and takes away your privacy.  These are all things that abusers do.\n\n**The red flags here are all that your MIL's behavior is not healthy, is very likely emotionally abusive, and is very much not how parents of grown children are supposed to treat their grown children**.  When my grown children say \"no\", I don't ask for reasons, I say \"oh, okay.\"  And we talk about something else.  I accept their decisions simply because they are adults and I love them.
