You absolutely should not do anything you don't feel comfortable doing, and it's a bit concerning that your partner is taking your MIL's side and is pressing the issue that much. It's none of her business to have your location 24/7. Sorry that this weird, possibly toxic and controlling, behavior is showing up only after you already got married.", "nta\n\nit is privacy.\n\nwhat is you mil gonna do anyway, if \"you are in danger\" or if you happen to go through an area that she perceives as \"dangerous\", but you don't?\n\nthis is just overstepping basic common decency boundaries.\n\nand you partner needs to learn when to back off. seriously, this is just a load of crap from that person and the MiL.", "NTA.

She\u2019s going to use it to check up on you.", "NTA. \n\n>the easy solution is to just share the location,\n\nNo it isn't. There is no good reason for her to want this. It would set an awful precedent if she were to get her way by nagging and harassing you \n\n>I should be able to choose who has it, not the other way around.\n\nExactly. Your partner should listen to you.", "NTA and what your MIL is wanting is digital snooping. Tell her that you have your own support network for your safety which has worked well over the years and you don't want to change that. Hold your ground as the next would be 'why were you at this location?' Time to tell your MIL to mind her own business.", "NTA. Two points: 1st and foremost- \u201cNo.\u201d is a complete sentence. She asked. You answered. End of story. I would stick to your guns on that point. Don\u2019t need to have a reason, don\u2019t need to give \u201cexcuses,\u201d don\u2019t need to validate her insistence. \n\n2nd, this is just weird. My parents tried this a few times in the last decade (I\u2019m in my mid 30s) as technology progressed and location services got easier to use. My counter argument has always been \u201cwhat will knowing my location possibly do in an emergency?\u201d And I\u2019ve yet to get a good response. The closest was \u201cif you were out hiking and got hurt.\u201d But when I go hiking my partner knows and I share my location with her during the hike. Hell, my partner and I have been together over 7 years and the only time we have that on is when one of us does a solo hiking/camping trip. Your MIL knowing your location does nothing of value even in an emergency. It\u2019s just that she is used to control and you\u2019re not bending to this \u201csmall\u201d request.

Is the scenario like she\u2019s got time on her hands to be nosy and will be commenting on everything you do and/or reporting back to your partner? \n\nNo fucking way should you allow her your location.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe your MIL any explanation about where you are/what you're doing", "NTA.

This is weird and intrusive at best.", "Just keep saying NO. The fact she cares so much is creepy and likely comes from some suspicions (\"is she cheating on my boy??\").

I honestly don't understand this trend of everybody having the right to know a person's location. It's unhealthy and way to exert control. The only exception is, of course, minor children. My SO and I don't share locations because if I can't trust you enough to not need to obsessively know your location, we have bigger problems.", "NTA and you are absolutely correct.  Do not give in to this and set boundaries.  My wife's family does this and I have no wish to know where they are and they have and wont ask me to share as well which is as it should be.  It is up to you and this is big enough that you husband needs to get on board with your decision asap.", "NTA, gross, I don\u2019t follow my own daughter because she deserves to have a private life. What is she thinking? This is a boundary you need to hardline maintain.", "NTA.\n\nThis is intrusive and creepy as hell. The fact that your husband doesn't see it that way is also pretty freaking weird. You're both fully grown adults, mommy dearest doesn't need to know where either of you are at any given time.

I don't know any adults who think their parents need to track them for safety purposes. \n\nIt's a great time to put your foot down and set some boundaries. You also need to talk to your spouse and make sure they're on your side. If you don't accomplish those two things you'll have more issues like this in the future.", "Absolutely NTA.  No.  That would feel creepy to me.  The only people who FMF me are my spouse and adult child, and it\u2019s for safety reasons only (we all like to solo hike, spouse got hurt once, we couldn\u2019t find him, now we \u201cstalk\u201d each other for safety \ud83d\ude0f).
