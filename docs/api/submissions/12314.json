People like me.\n\nWe were at our friends\u2019 house the other day, and I wanted to go home. We had been there for two hours, and I was getting sleepy. I told my boyfriend that I would only spend two hours there because I didn\u2019t feel like going, to begin with. He said we had a deal, so I was surprised when he said he wanted to be there a little longer.\n\nThey were talking about sports, and I didn\u2019t care; I just wanted to go home. Every once and a while, I would suggest we leave, and they would keep talking. I even got up to stand by the door with my stuff, and my boyfriend turned his back on me and kept talking. We were there for another hour and a half, and they were talking.\n\nWhen we got into the care, I was so over it that I couldn\u2019t talk to him. On the drive home, he told me that I embarrassed him because I was acting like a child and that he was trying to have a conversation. I told him we had a deal, and he did not follow through; I had the right to be upset. He didn\u2019t yell at me, but he did snap and said that he hadn\u2019t seen his friend in almost two years in person because he was overseas and that they were catching up. He did say sorry for making me stay longer, but he said I was a spoiled brat and not everything needs to go my way.\n\nI told him that he knew what I was before he dated me, and we should break up if he didn\u2019t like it. I was joking, but he agreed. He dropped me off at my house and drove off, not even waiting for me to go inside. It\u2019s been almost a day, and he hasn\u2019t texted or called me back. His mother told me to give him some time, and his sister told me it was true and that I need to learn to treat people better.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to break up; I\u2026was running at the mouth.

First, I can relate about feeling bad/anxious about something you guys had previously agreed on. And would feel so bad about him ignoring me and the agreement. \nHowever, you probably weren\u2019t the easiest person just waiting (I wouldn\u2019t be too). Your mistake was suggesting to break up, but both of you acted on because were hurt on the argument. If he loves you, will come back reaching you. Best of luck !", "YTA. Good for him to finally have somebody like you out of his life", "YTA. You are spoiled and entitled and you feel as long as you let people know you have the emotional  maturity of a toddler, that it should be okay.  Guess what, it's not.

But maybe", "I\u2019m leaning with YTA on this one mostly bc of the entitlement. Did you have a discussion and verbally come to an agreement at about the time you would stay beforehand?

Do something nice for someone else for once in your life and let the poor guy be.", "YTA. \nHe dodged a bullet. Thank you for breaking up w him. \nIf people know you're a spoiled brat then it's your responsibility to behave like an adult. Not everyone is going to teach you the difference between right and wrong.\n\nPeople give you what you want so you won't throw a tantrum like a 2 year old. I don't think that's your charm I think it's people avoiding childish drama. \n\nJust because you're a spoiled person it doesn't give you ANY RIGHT TO fondle with your boyfriend's life. If he's enjoying a party then let him. You have no right to manipulate him because you're spoiled. People put their bad habits away when they are in a relationship with someone. NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO CARRY THAT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU WERE LIKE THAT BEFORE ENTERING THE RELATIONSHIP. it's toxic. \n\nAnd you had the audacity to break up after your behavior. THE IRONY.. I'm pretty sure you're expecting him to come back to you and say sorry and then continue your life like a spoiled woman. \nGROW UP!", "Wow.  Well, first - yes, YTA.  This type of behavior is NOT charming, no matter what you think.  I\u2019m sure people tolerate it for periods of time, but I bet they eventually get tired of it and fade out of your life when it becomes exhausting.  Also, stop blaming it on being an only child.  I know many only children who are kind, generous people who treat other people with respect and consideration.  \n\nNow, to your question, what should you do:  you have a few choices.\n\n(1) you can give him space, hope he calls you, and if he doesn\u2019t, move on.  Find another BF to treat the way you treat people.\n\n(2) Sincerely apologize.  You behaved atrociously, and it sounds like you act this way all of the time, and he\u2019s tired of it.  So you apologize, and commit to him that you will change your behavior and be more considerate and less selfish.  But if you do this and he agrees to give you a second chance, you actually must change your \u201ccharming\u201d behavior.  If you don\u2019t intend to commit to that, then don\u2019t bother with this choice.  \n\n(3) You can sincerely apologize, but not agree to change your behavior, and let him decide whether or not to continue your association.  If he decides not to, accept it, and move on.  \n\nOP, may I suggest it\u2019s time for a little self reflection and some tweaks to the way you treat other people.  People who insist on always getting their way all the time are very unpleasant.", "You are 32 years old and think always getting what you want and acting spoiled is endearing. It\u2019s not, you are old enough to know how to be respectful, people aren\u2019t going to keep putting up with that. \n\nWhile he went back on the deal it\u2019s understandable when he hasn\u2019t seen his friend for long and honestly it sounds like you were acting immature. He deserves an apology and so do his friends, you were acting like a child asking their mom to leave, not a 32 year old woman speaking to her boyfriend. In relationships you compromise for eachother, it doesn\u2019t sound like you are capable of that, your partner was excited to see his friend for the first time in years but you were tired and the conversation wasn\u2019t centered around you so instead of being uncomfortable for a bit so he could have joy, you acted worse than my toddler.\n\n\nYour parents let you down allowing you to think the world revolves around you and that it\u2019s charming, it\u2019s not. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry (not sorry) OP but you sound like a massive headache and a walking red flag.\n\n>I am the only child and was rasied spoiled\n\nRed flag number 1\n\n>I always get what I want and when I want it, and no one has ever seem to have a problem with it because I\u2019m charming.

You had so many opportunities to not be an asshole. Do you even care about his feelings?", "ESH. You sound entitled and exhausting. Your bf sounds incapable of adult conversations. I wish you both luck with whoever you end up with next.\n\nAlso, never bring up a breakup unless that\u2019s what you want or are willing to go through with it. It\u2019s tacky, they may take you up on it, and if you\u2019re not willing to walk away, you start from a position of weakness.", "NTA, based on the fact that your bf should have not even brought you along.

People like me.\n\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what mommy and daddy told you. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure this is true.
