Her sister is mad at him because he attended a funeral out of country and she didn't want him to leave. Should everyone judging have followed your comment above and judged the husband at fault for attending the funeral? \n\nWell, the vast, vast majority completely disagreed with the sentiment in your generalized comment and called her an AH. The context there is he travelled out of country to attend the funeral of *both his brother and cousin*, directly related since they were family members rather than a friend's family member like here, sounded like very sudden and unexpected deaths compared to the expected death here and they must have been far, far younger than the grandfather in this post, and the wife was 8 months along (could go in labour at any time, but not as high a likelihood compared to a few weeks later) compared to surgery happening almost simultaneously like here. \n\n***Context matters.*** \n\nSure, see to the living and yes the dead don't care and can't be helped.
