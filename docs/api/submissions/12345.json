I was honored to have been with my friend for support when her grandpa passed. It was peaceful but still very hard.\n\nThe day after his passing, my husband went into the hospital for what was supposed to be a routine reconstruction of his ACL and MCL. While in recovery, his heart rate jumped and he spiked a fever. He was sweating bullets, shivering uncontrollably, and in so much pain. It all hit within an hour or less and was very jarring. It really scared me because I\u2019ve hardly ever seen him sick with so much as a cold. After some rounds of antibiotics he got better and was discharged. However, we were informed a second surgery was needed because the first one didn\u2019t hold up I guess.\n\nHis surgery is on Friday afternoon and the funeral is on Saturday morning. I\u2019m quite terrified to not be at home with my husband while he recovers in case he gets sick again. My husband is comfortable with me attending the funeral, but I\u2019m very unsettled about it. His mother was originally going to come and help regardless but she is now sick with COVID. \n\nI\u2019ve asked another friend their opinion and they said it would be very selfish of me not to attend.

Routine surgeries can go wrong and his health and well being should take precedence here. It's unfortunate but if your friend is a good friend they should understand unlike some of the rabid asshats we hear about on this sub.", "NAH. You have a valid reason - essentially an emergency - for why you would want to stay with your husband. He has surgery, the first time didn't go so well, and no one else can care for him as he recovers. \n\nYour friend may be understanding and may not be. It's hard to say. But telling them now or ASAP and then letting them process that as they will may be the best course of action. If now is short notice, tomorrow will be even shorter.", "NTA. It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to be at your partners side especially after the scary experience with the surgery and I\u2019m sure if you explain this they will understand!", "YWNBTA \n\nIf your friend is a true friend, they would be understanding. Just explain the situation. You should care for your husband.", "NTA - You have a medical situation to attend to. Caring for your husband takes priority over attending the funeral.", "Id say NTA. Its an optional event, if you cant attent or dont want to attend then dont. Going to the funeral wont resurrect them. \n\nCaveat though. Most funerals are short notice. Nobody plans to die and the funeral usually happens in <=week from death.", "Call your friend who's grandfather died; explain your husband is very ill and is having surgery the day before the funeral, you'd rather stay with him in case anything goes wrong.

Your priorities change and you need to be there for your partner and for yourself during this time. I'm sure your friend would understand.

For you to be selfish in this situation would require skipping the funeral telling your husband good luck and having a relaxing day at a spa, or a vacation somewhere fun.\n\nBeing responsible for someone else isn't a selfish act.", "NTA as live people always take precedence over the dead. Its not like you are heading over to Disney world but to care for your possibly sick/ recovering husband. If its a true friend he/ she would understand as you are left with almost zero options and its not good to leave your husband alone the day after the surgery. Reach out and talk in private and hopefully there shall be peace. You can always light a candle at home with a prayer if you wish to during the time of the funeral.", "You are NOT selfish! You've already done things for granddad which was very kind and thoughtful of you, but the other man is your husband who has to come first.", "NTA. IMO, your commitment to your husband in a time of need is greater than to your friend. And your friend\u2019s grandfather, unfortunately, has already passed. There\u2019s not much you can do except provide moral support. Your husband on the other hand, has reason to believe he may have complications from this surgery and may need you to help make medical decisions.

What kind of time commitment are we talking about? If the funeral is nearby, and assuming nothing goes wrong in the surgery on Friday, I would try to get a friend to sit with your husband for an hour or two while you attend.

I'd forgive your friend, assuming it's grief making them say this awful thing to you, but by all means you should stay with your partner when they need you.", "Aren't all funerals last minute? It's not like you get a save the date invitation months in advance, right?", "NTA your living spouse takes precedence here.

No way, your family is obviously more important, especially the living one...grandpa is dead, he won't get offended.", "INFO- Where is the funeral? If it's local, I'd definitely go. Your husband would probably appreciate the quiet house for a nap, binge tv watching, or video games anyway. If you need to travel for the funeral then I understand your hesitation.", "First, I am sorry that your friends grandfather died and that your husband is also having health struggles. I admire your dedication to both. Stay strong in the difficult time. Second, I think you should go. You play an important role in this funeral.

There is no valid reason to think your husband won't be fine. It was scary when he got sick but the doctors wouldn't do the surgery if they thought it was risky.

People don't die on a preplanned schedule. Short notice for funerals is normal.\n\nYou're nervous about husband but he'll be fine if you take a couple of hours for the funeral.

Exactly the same timeline as this follow up surgery.", "The doctors won't clear him for surgery if they feel there in any risk. They assess the situation and believe the surgery will be fine.
