Few weeks back my cousin 24(F) came at my place to stay with my family during my birthday week. While we were talking about random things I told her that I have an individual spotify premium account for a year. My dad pays for this account since I am a student, and I don't earn. Today she messaged me saying \"you have a spotify premium right? can you share this account with me?\" I didn't wanted to share it and for few reasons. Firstly, I didn't wanted spotify to recommend me music based on her taste, plus I don't quite feel comfortable because I thought she might judge my music taste. Lastly, I was furious about the fact that she has a job and she can pay for her own acc. So when I was replying to her text I lied to her that my premium has ended and I don't have it anymore, I just couldn't say a big clear 'NO!' And since I told her before about my acc, she knows that I lied. She now called my mom complaining that I lied to her. My mom hasn't said anything to me but I feel guilty.", "created_utc": 1703690561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s33jb/aita_for_lying_to_my_cousin_about_having_a/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is pathetic.", "ESH\n\nYour cousin is a free loader.\n\nYou lied. You should have simply said, \"No, sorry. I won't do that.\"\n\nStop avoiding conflicts. Conflict avoider almost always end up being assholes, because the conflict is rarely avoided. It is just pushed down the road and amplified.", "YTA for not just telling her the real reason. NTA for not agreeing to share. I'd never let someone use my spotify unless I know they had a very similar taste in music to me. Most of the fun from spotify is discovering new music with the algorithm learning what I like. One afternoon of someone listening to trash will ruin my account forever.", "YTA. People can make requests and people can deny requests. This is such low stakes it's bizarre you would lie, especially when it seems like she already knows and therefore the lie becomes a bigger issue than the original request.", "NTA, tell her to get her own Spotify account if she wants one that badly.", "YTA for lying. But, not the AH for not wanting to share your account. Let your parents know why your cousin complained so that they understand she was trying to get your account access without paying. Also, all you need to say is no; you don't owe anyone reasons or explanations when you are refusing something that makes you feel uncomfortable.", "Judge you on your musical taste? Who tf cares? Recommend music based on her tastes? Um, if you can have multiple accounts, aren't they separate? So why would your musical tastes or hers matter. If you don't want her to use the account because she makes money.....um, just tell her.\n\n\nETA\n\nIf you have an account based on your student status, I doubt anyone else can use it. If you are going to lie, be an educated liar, it helps.", "NTA\n\nalso FYI it's not the music taste that you should worry about. My husband and I share an account. You can only have it active on one device at a time. So if you are using it and listening to music, the other person can't listen to it on their device (or they have to kick you off first).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also what were they offering in return? I give my Spotify to someone they give me their Disney+ login for an account.", "Y are u lying and ur 18 u still care what ppl think of u, that\u2019s crazy u need to grow up\u2026 Nta but u are an asshole for lying don\u2019t be a clown just be honest and if ppl aren\u2019t rocking with u then they aren\u2019t for u.", "NTA.  But you need to learn to say no to people and be prepared for them to not like you for standing up for yourself.", "YTA - You need to grow up and just speak the truth here.  You didn't want to share your account with her, why all the lying?  That's it.  Be an adult about things like this then you won't be caught in any lies.  You now have created purely unnecessary drama over what, a Spotify account?  If I was your Mom I would have your Dad cancel the account altogether, you aren't mature enough to have it.", "This is the way, OP. No one likes conflict, but your lie only created more conflict.

NTA.  They do a two person account, but it costs more.  You've got a one person account and you've trained your algorithm.", "You can get a student discount on Spotify. It\u2019s almost half off. You should look into that to save money. Also a premium family plan is pretty affordable and you get 5-6 people on the account for a few $ more. Totally worth it so that 5 of us and my niece are on my family plan.", "NTA. Don't lie, you're wasting the expression \"get stuffed\".\n\nUnless they offer to pay half and you're into that kind of thing.", "If she wants free spotify she can listen to the ads.  You are under no obligation to share anything with anyone.", "You're in college? Didn't wanted.........", "Tell your cousin she needs to grow up and pay for it on her own and not mooch off of you. Plus, she\u2019s very childish for saying something to your mom about it.", "Go to offline mode in settings -> playback. Then you can listen to music as you please with any number of devices. That is what my sister and I do. Only works if you save songs to your library.", "You can do a family account for a couple bucks more a month (less then $5 normally, but more if you\u2019re a student). Each person has a different log in so you aren\u2019t really sharing an account and don\u2019t have that problem. I think you have have up to 4 people sharing.", "You can't have multiple profiles on spotify. You can have multiple accounts, if you make multiple accounts with multiple email addresses, but you can only use one subscription for one account.\n\nSpotify doesn't have student accounts. OP's dad is paying because they're a student.", "It\u2019s not a Spotify student subscription, it\u2019s just that her father pays for it because she\u2019s a student. And like the other commenter said, cousin wants to share the account to share the premium subscription so no, there won\u2019t be separate accounts.", "Oh yes, no one in college can make a typo.", "Odd, I looked it up and the site said there were discounted student accounts (verified by a third party site) and three types of premium accounts, one a family account that allows for multiple profiles, another for couples that allows separate profiles under the same roof and the regular premium.", "Not the exact same one twice in the same paragraph. \ud83d\ude06", "Have you heard of phones?
