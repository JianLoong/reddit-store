Time, money, and any extra resources were all given to my middle sister so that she could have doctor's, tutors, a special school, etc. From the age of 5 I was pretty much left to raise myself, and when my youngest sister was born, I pretty much raised her too. \n\nI struggled a lot in highschool as I also have a mild version of my sister's disability (but it was ignored since hers was much more severe). My parents did not help me at all, they ignored my concerns about my grades, rejected my request for a tutor, and did not seem to care at all that I was pretty much failing. I did not even have time to study on my own as much of my life at home revolved around taking care of my sisters.\n\nI managed to graduate and immediately took a retail job that I am still at today. My youngest sister graduates this weekend and my parents asked me to attend. The thought literally makes me want to throw up. By the time my youngest sister hit highschool, my middle sister no longer lived at home, and she was on state benefits. That meant my parents suddenly had all the time and money in the world which they used to get my youngest sister in an amazing, private highschool. They gave her tons of support and she is graduating with honors and has an offer to attend an ivy league college. \n\nIt may be childish, but I do not feel like it is fair at all. I don't hold a grudge against my sister, and I have sent her a graduation card, but the thought of sitting through a whole ceremony and hearing my parents talk about all of her accomplishments is too much. \n\nThey are extremely upset about the fact that I said I won't go. I haven't talked to my sister yet, but I assume she will be upset as well. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I have seen a lot of comments saying that choosing to not attend the graduation is some \"revenge plot\" against my parents. That is not it at all; I'm trying to protect my own feelings, as well as not ruin my sister's celebration by being negative or jealous. I am not good at hiding my feelings and I'm afraid she would be able to tell. I could care less what my parents say or think.\n\nAlso, my sister and I are not very close anymore. I moved out after I turned 18 and our contact has been limited. I truly don't know how she would feel about me missing the ceremony. Regardless, I will take your suggestions about taking her out for dinner separately from my parents so we can talk.", "created_utc": 1686056873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142fjuo/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_little_sisters/", "score": 8462, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents sound awful. \n \nI would not blame you at all for not going.

I can\u2019t remember who came to mine \n\nYou cooould go separately and not sit with your parents and leave after you hug your sister and give her flowers, and you could ask to take her out for lunch another day to celebrate, have a talk with her about this. It sounds like you helped raise her to be the person she is, and get her to this point.\n\nYou should be proud of yourself and everything you\u2019ve accomplished, and if not sitting next to people who abused you listening to really triggering conversation is something that will protect you and your mental heath you should skip it!!\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know where you live, but I know in Canada once you\u2019re a mature student if you apply for school, your HS grades don\u2019t matter. Hopefully, maybe that\u2019s a thing there? Just because you didn\u2019t go right after high school it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no chance for you to do post secondary education ever.", "NTA.

Have they ever offered to make it up to you?", "NTA and everyone acting like it'll be super easy for you to sit through a fancy graduation for your sister that was handed everything you never got a chance to have are just silly.

Can you/would you be willing to attend to support your sister but not sit with your parents? You can be there to support her if you wanted and wouldn't need to deal with your parents bs.", "NTA.  But I loathe graduation ceremonies (even my own) and avoid them like the plague.  You sent her a card, when you see her be the loving sister that you are (it's not her fault your parents are jerks), and avoid your parents whenever possible.", "NTA.  Talk to your parents and be honest about their negligent impacted your future.  Don't' be surprised if they do not take ownership.  Talk to your sister separately and tell her you are proud of her and want the best for her but attending her graduations will open wounds that you are still working through.   For your own sake work with someone to let go of your hurt and anger.", "NTA. Your parents suck. However... in not going, your sister may think you hold it against her.

Realistically, you need a plan to get thru the rest of her special moments. But it's okay to skip this one.\n\nIt's also okay to say- before sister's graduation or after, but it may make you feel better even if it makes no difference- mom and dad need to sit down with you and you get to list out how they failed you. How they focused so much on middle sister, that they ignored you and your education so you didn't get the opportunities that little sister got. \n\nYes, your parents had a child with extreme disabilities but that doesn't excuse them from being a good parent to you every day of your childhood and ensuring that you got at least 50% of the attention that your middle sister got. That you got the support you needed to be successful.\n\nI'm not saying it would have been easy for them. But they were the parents. Not you. It was their job to take care and raise you. Not yours.", "INFO: can you go, but not sit with your parents? That way you can still support your sister, but quietly.", "NTA at all.  You were dealt a shit hand, forced to raise yourself, and then are asked to be happy to watch the privileged child graduate and have your nose rubbed into all of the support and love that she got and you didn't.

Don't let anyone tell you different.", "Maybe you could go to the graduation but sit away from your parents and avoid them?", "You should go but sit far away from your parents and interact with your sister separately when they\u2019re not.", "I\u2019m sorry you were abused growing with parentification. You were used as a tool to help your parents cope better and you should never have had to go through that. You also felt ignored and unloved as a result. You deserved better. As an adult who was emotionally parentified as a child, none of that was my siblings fault. I will always step up and support them because I love them. I understand the bitterness and resentment you feel, but your sister didn\u2019t cause it. If you were to go, sitting in a different area would be very loud and clear to your parents just how you feel about them, while also being there for your sister. If you don\u2019t think you can, then talk to her in advance, otherwise there maybe some resentment towards you for not going. It\u2019s hard balancing family like this and I get it. I\u2019m 45 now and trying to navigate things. I think seeking out a therapist would be a good thing for you to do as well, you deserve to heal from the pain they caused you.\n\nEdited to add judgement NTA", "OP I think NTA - to cut a long story short, in many ways I feel your pain. \n\nHowever, if you do go, you don\u2019t lose any moral high ground and you could use it as an olive branch and segue to talk to your parents about the challenges they made you face growing up. Maybe they could provide more support to you in your young adulthood. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the situation you\u2019ve faced and lost time/opportunity you\u2019ve experienced. Truly, though, you are young and have your whole life ahead of you. It isn\u2019t nearly too late to change your situation.", "NTA. In short you never have to do anything you don't want to do. But also it is not your sisters fault.\n\nIf I were you I'd probably go and then later have an honest conversation about the lack of support from your parents and the impact it's had on your life \n\nHowever instead of blaming them, you need an opportunity they can help you with. Maybe going back to school, doing a programming Bootcamp, trade school etc. Something that will better your life.\n\nSee if they will help you with that.", "NTA. Your little sister didn't do anything wrong. This is about what your parents did to you. Your parents suck. You should cut them out of your life.", "NTA. Though you could always go to the graduation and leave after... not go to lunch or dinner or whatever after (where most of the family interaction would happen).", "I\u2019d press her for this INFO: does your sister want you there?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem fair to punish her for the things you never had. It sucks but if you want to have a decent relationship with her into adulthood it would be beneficial to support her if she wants it. She may not care though. My middle sister didn\u2019t even walk the stage for her college graduation because she knows the ceremonies are boring! \n\nI am one of five so I partially get how different siblings had very different childhood experiences.", "NTA. Why would you want that all rubbed in your face. It's not too late for you to go to college. Maybe if you let them know that they'll finally do something for you.", "NTA.  Why do your parents even have a current phone number for you? What is the point of interacting with any of them?", "NTA. Btw your parents can fuck off all the way and get bent.\n\nI would however suggest that you talk to your sis and maybe do something together after the fact in celebration.", "NTA why would you want to sit through hours of her accomplishments rubbed in your face whilst you weren\u2019t given the same opportunities. You were practically ignored at the expense of your middle sister being able to do well that you didn\u2019t do as well either.", "NTA", "NTA.  Why are you even still in contact with your parents?", "ESH What about going to the ceremony but sitting separately from your parents? Skip the meal/celebration after, but show up for your sister.", "NTA. I wasn\u2019t able to graduate college no fault of my own after being on the deans list every semester I was there. It devastated me. And while it\u2019s not exactly analogous I completely understand that sitting through the ceremony could be painful AND also get OP isn\u2019t jealous of or mad at her sister. OP is lamenting a life she could\u2019ve had or dealing with the pain of the imbalance. You\u2019re not wrong OP. I\u2019ve been there. Stay strong. Therapy helps me a lot.", "NTA for feeling this way, but I do wish you'd reconsider if by trying to punish your parents you're punishing your sister, too, and if so, that's something you intend to do.", "NTA, let\u2019s normalize not doing things you don\u2019t want to do. That doesn\u2019t make you an ass.", "NTA, but you should talk this through with your sister.", "It depends whether your want for your family to know how begrudged you feel outweighs your family relationships.\n\nIf your sister has done nothing wrong in the situation, yet has accomplished something, surely you should go! \n\nThe problem seems to be with the parents and not her, so let those concerns out in private, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your sisters fault.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult already. Choose your peace above family.", "No sweetheart and I\u2019m so sorry. It is absolutely ok to put yourself first, especially if no one else will. You are worth every bit of the love and attention your sisters received.", "Very soft YTA. None of this is your sisters fault, you could go to her graduation to support her, just don't sit with your parents and avoid them, I totally get your anger at your parents, and it's completely justified with the combination of neglect and parentification you had to deal with. But that anger is only hurting your sister in this instance.  \n\n\nThis all changes to NTA if your sister is ok with you not being there and it's your parents and not her wanting you there", "NTA\n\nIt's not your sisters fault and it would probably mean a lot to her to have you there.  Be the bigger person and go for her sake.\n\nHowever during the ceremony I don't think there is any harm in making sure your parents know exactly how you feel about the lack of support they gave you so you could never experience anything like that.", "NTA. Take that day to go do something for yourself.", "I get it. It sucks when the younger siblings get everything you never got. There is jealousy but you have to understand that your younger sister had nothing to do with your parents' treatment. \n\nIn the end it's your decision. You have to decide if you're okay with hurting your sister just because of your parents' behavior. \n\nYour Parents are A H - that's clear. Your sister isn't one. You - I'm not sure. I'm between NTA and YTA.", "NTA: it\u2019s hard to watch someone be given things you would have also thrived with had they given you the chance. You did well for yourself and you are moving forward. I agree that this may hurt your sister as she did not experience the same things you did as a child. Does she know that your parents set you aside while taking care of the middle child? Does she brag about how your parents care for her? If no, then maybe consider going and sit somewhere else. Congratulate her at the end and simply walk away when you see your parents. If yes, then no don\u2019t go. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Continue to heal and make good for yourself and yes, continue to not hold any grudge as that can become toxic and that\u2019s hard to come back from.", "So, I get your view, I totally sympathize with how your parents really screwed up. They suck, point blank.\n\nBut I do think that, if you're not going ONLY because of your parents, you're not hurting them, you're hurting your sister. \n\nCould you go and sit away from them? Because the graduation should be about your sister. She had nothing to do with the way your parents treated you. \n\nI get you're jealous about her opportunities, but don't forget that, up until five years ago, she was treated the same as you.\n\nI'm gonna go with YTA because you're going to take out your anger on your sister when she isn't the problem.", "NAH. Everyone did the best they could given the circumstances. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late for you to have what you need to succeed. I would have a heart to heart with your parents and ask if they can support you pursing community college or university (if that\u2019s what your goal is). Your younger sister may have gotten that help earlier in life, but don\u2019t resent her for it, it\u2019s the way the cards fell. \n\nIt seems like your parents recognize the shortcomings they had while middle sis was still in their care and have made up for it with little sis- talk to them and ask for the chance as well. They may think you have your life together as is, only communication will help.\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to go to graduation, but maybe give communication a chance.", "This one is tough, but you would risk destroying your relationship with your youngest sister(someone who's success you yourself invested in) because of your parent's failings\n\nESH except for you if you go & your sisters", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parents most likely say things like \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, why would you want that?\u201d because from what it sounds like, they have no clue why OP wouldn\u2019t want to be around them. Then OP is backed into a corner and either has to explain why she doesn\u2019t want to hear them talk about her sister, or double down on \u201cbecause I want to\u201d and possibly turn this into an even bigger argument, which could lead to little sister feeling stressed and upset that her graduation day feels like it\u2019s no longer about her.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s try a different scenario.

She could maybe use the excuse that she thought she was going to be late, but then again usually graduation ceremonies aren\u2019t that strict about everyone having to stay stuck in their seats as soon as it begins. This would also complicate things if OP still lives at home, because parents would likely be confused as to why op wanted to travel separately, etc. \n\nPeople think going to the event and avoiding the problematic people is the least confrontational way to go about this, when it\u2019s clearly not. Making the choice to stay away from someone is liable to incite a lot of emotions, and of course, confrontation.\n\nI think OP should try to find a better compromise to support her sister. Maybe go to the ceremony (and begrudgingly sit with parents) and then skip the dinner plans afterwards, saying that she wants to celebrate alone with her sister at a different time. But to be fair, OP isn\u2019t OBLIGATED to go to this in my opinion. Sure, it would be nice and it makes sense given their relationship, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a graduation ceremony. It\u2019s one day.

That means far more to me than putting on a nice outfit and showing up to an event. I think some people here are putting etiquette in front of sister\u2019s real feelings.

Your sister didn't do those things to you, so why are you crapping on her and her achievements?", "NAH. Kids don't come with owner's manuals, and parents often have little to no support in raising a child with disabilities.

Put your harsh resentments and bitterness aside and show up for your sister. For HER. Sit somewhere else and give her some flowers and leave quickly after. Maybe even come late. But by not going you are punishing your sister, not your parents. This will surely drive more of a wedge in your family dynamics and possibly ruin a great future relationship with your sister.

It\u2019s very hard to manage caring for a child with high support needs while also supporting the children with fewer/no support needs. Without knowing their financial situation we can\u2019t say why certain choices were made; did they not care about OP\u2019s grades, or were they only able to afford one tutor and gave it to the child who wouldn\u2019t be able to function without? \n\nThis seems like a situation where the able bodied child falls through the cracks, not because of any ill will, or even necessarily favoritism, but because one child required such tremendous support that it superseded all else. And yes, that is a massive failure on the part of the parents. Each child deserves time and attention, no matter their level of care needs. To do otherwise was, and is, neglect.\n\nAnd the parents should NOT have had child 3, given how badly they were balancing two. That was not a great decision on their part.\n\nAnd, just to note, balance is possible. Not easy, perhaps, and not monetarily always viable. But attention-wise it is possible. If they couldn\u2019t afford two tutors, the parents should have set aside time to help OP. They should have set times for OP to have one on one time with them and stuck to it. Certainly, OP should not have been responsible for raising herself and her youngest sister. The parents were complete failures on many levels. Indifference can be worse than malice.", "While I agree with most of this, the younger child also benefited by being raised by OP. This was not her fault, but it put a further strain on OP's life/ability to study.", "Please don't put this on OP to fix.  OP is in a lot of understandable pain from how neglected she was growing up.

If OP truly raised the little sister, she should want to be there for her, deliver the card, gift, and a hug by hand, and say she hopes little sis has a wonderful future. \n\nThe resentment is reasonable but it will eat her up inside and ruin relationships if she lets it continue ruining otherwise happy occasions for the family.", "Yes, this is common.

It's hard, though - the parentification of these siblings is awful, and the denial of their needs is even worse. \n\nThere are resources, but they are often underutilized by the families. Denial is powerful. And it's often really hard for the well sibling to ask for/admit they need help, because it gets cast as not loving/accepting their sibling.", "It's a common but unhealthy family dynamic. Parents focus on the needs that are screaming and ignore the ones that whisper.", ">Is this a normal thing people do when they have one special needs child?\n\nDue to my job I sadly see it way too often. \n\nIt usually goes one of two ways:\n\n1. The special needs child gets all the attention and gets treated as the most important person in the parents life. Everything else is irrelevant and that child is never at fault, no matter what happens.\n2. The special needs child receives all the attention from the parents. Every ounce of energy flows towards them, but they also do get blamed all the time by their parents for how their (parents) life sucks because of it.\n\nIn both cases every other child gets neglected big time. Usually, there are also outliers, even though it's rare. The parents in the first case also usually see it as \"not a problem\" to neglect their other child/s. They basically matter next to nothing, are to blame for everything that goes south and they (the children) only have to take and think of the needs of the child with the disability(s). \n\nIt's why it was recently very heartwarming to see one parent break out in tears because he knows how much he neglects his oldest. The parent is a single dad. The oldest has no disabilities. The second son has trisomy 21. His youngest is mentally challenged and has physical disabilities as well. Especially the youngest son is very hard to deal with. Therefor the vast majority of time goes to him and the rest to the second son.\n\nHe has his girlfriend, but both kids don't really want to do anything with her. Both do get very aggressive towards her. His mom sometimes helps in emergencies. The biological mother of those children is nowhere to be seen (as so often, it makes me wonder why that mother still has child custody). \n\nHe tried to get help via different services and programs from the state, etc, but no-one had the nerves to deal with the youngest one long-term. So he basically has to deal with this situation on his own. \n\nHis youngest is now in our ward to see how we can help via medicine and therapy. His second son is on a two week trip through a special program (don't really remember what though). The dad now wants to use this time to make up with his oldest. He's his son, too, and the dad hates how little time he has for him and how much it affects their relationship. But he also sees no other way currently.\n\nBut this is an outlier of a parent who actually thinks of all his children. Most don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the OP. NTA from me, but if there's a possibility that she could attend and avoid the parents or do something with her sisters some time afterwards to celebrate the graduation, I think OP should do it.

Like, call her, congratulate her, maybe explain calmy why she didn't go, etc.", "this is a good point- you have to prepared for them to not acknowledge that you are right. this is really just so you can get this stuff off you chest.\n\nthat's its sole purpose.", "I see this is a valid option for a compromise, but there are a lot of other factors that could potentially get in the way.\n\n~~Does OP still live with parents?

Sister worked hard and should be celebrated for this accomplishment. \n\n*But it's okay for OP to not be able to be around it.*\n\nThis situation brings back all of the upset, the feeling of abandonment, the unresolved hurt and anger towards the parents, the jealousy that she didn't get the same treatment, it forces all of these complicated emotions front and center. \n\nIt's so hard to show that you're happy for someone else when you're battling difficult, conflicting, unresolved emotions. Ans then you feel guilty for not being as happy as you think you should be for them. If you seem sad, or off, or snippy because of your emotional state, then the other person is going to feel like it's their fault or that you're upset with them. It takes that special moment away from the other person, and everyone ends up feeling hurt in some way or another.

She can always do something with sister a little later on, once the raw emotions have time to settle. \n\nIf OP isn't going to go, I think the healthiest thing to do would be to speak to her sister.

But because she's processing a lot of heavy emotions about their parents and the way her own schooling went down. She needs some time to process everything in a healthy way, and being there in person will bubble up a lot of those hard feelings. But that doesn't mean she's any less happy for sister or any less proud. Maybe extend an offer to go to a movie or dinner soon, OPs treat as their own celebration together. \n\nI'm sure that her sister would understand. After all, sister was neglected too. She didn't get treated better until OP was an adult and the state took over care of their other sibling. I'm sure she knows all too well those complicated feelings OP might be going through and can sympathize with why this could be a triggering event.

Am I not responsible for that hurt?  Codependency involves taking responsibility for other people's actions not taking responsibility for your own.

In a very real way she ended up as a parent to her sister and is unsupringly important to her sister.  That's not fair to either of them, but that damage is done.  Her choosing to abandon her sister is not some making someone else responsible bs.  It is a direct action that has explicit consequences.  If I create a boundary with party A and in doing so cause harm to party B...I'm still responsible for what I do to party B.  We're in a place where we should be weighing the harm we are causing an innocent party to protect ourselves, and every indication is she explored absolutely nothing about minimizing harm to herself.  Another example that may illustrate my point.  If I have a child with my ex, and I would like to have boundaries to protect myself from my ex, but those boundaries harm my child, is that ok?  No, it ceases to be that simple, now you have to weigh the harm done to me vs the harm done to the child.  If it's just me and the ex, yeah nice and simple, I can do what I want/need because I have no responsibility to the ex beyond how I deal with the ex.  Sure seems to me like a decent amount of her actions aren't just avoiding dealing with her parents it's her jealousy of her sister.

It is fairly silly to just have an attitude that if her parents had spent more she is just in an ivy league school (not saying that college is some unattainable goal, nor that maybe she would have made ivy league, but she doesn't seem to attribute any of her sisters success to her sister).

If I had the resources to get her tested when she was younger, she'd more than likely have an asperger's dx (but there's a silver lining for waiting, and i glad now i didn't have choice then lol). If I had additional resources, then I'd have been able to get special treatment as aspberger's (and adhd) can often present differently in girls. If I had even more resources, I'd have been able to afford extra help and tutor programs and take her to sylvan (or something like it) for dedicated help. But I didn't have resources. So I did the best I could with what I had. She actually made honor roll twice two years ago, which set her on the upper class path. But she struggled and completely shut down when it came to math. Struggling caused her to shut down even more for 2 quarters. She finally pulled it together in the final quarters, and saw what she had been capable of all along. But I had to push and pull her the entire way lol. Now that I earn so much more, I have access to more. But I can see the irreversible impact of when I didn't. She struggles to commit to her school work, and doesn't want to celebrate anyone else who can, out of jealousy. She knows she could be receiving honors, too. She possesses the capability. I tell her this repeatedly. Just because i wasn't able to give her all the things didn't mean she doesn't have all she needs. I caution her to check herself, not to let the universe return to her the disdain she has for others doing well. Ultimately, it's her decision to do well, or not. She must make daily choices and choose success today. She's getting it...nothing happens unless we make it happen. Some of those kids being honored have had horrific hurdles that make her look privileged.  \nMy younger son happens to benefit from my continued success as he came into the world when my career was finally gaining traction. I think OP needs to let go of her bitterness for the past and accept it for what it was. We're all dealt cards, and it's often no one's fault. I wish middle sister had access to resources sooner so OP's entitlement could be met, even a little. But it didn't happen that way.  OP can choose to start making deliberate decisions toward her personal goals and successes. You can continue to bitterly hate others and make excuses and be jealous, or choose your own path and make accomplishments. As an adult, OPs worse enemy is herself. There's nothing really stopping her.", "From what OP says, that relationship is dying and sis is doing little to save it. No loss in my book. I value my graduate degree ceremony far more than the one that basically says; you\u2019re 18-ish; do something productive with your life.", "While I agree with most of this, the younger child also benefited by being raised by OP. This was not her fault, but it put a further strain on OP's life/ability to study.", "I knew people where this wasn't the case. But in most of those cases, I have a feeling they took advantage of support systems that are available.\n\nAnd were in a slightly more advantageous financial position- that will make a big difference.", "I got the recommendation from another redditor and it has helped me tremendously to work towards growth as a human being. It will be hard to read but I've learned a quote I really like: \"Change is painful. Growth is painful. But nothing is as painful as remaining somewhere you're not meant to be\".", "I hope it helps. I came across the recommendation here on Reddit as well. The beginning of the book goes through recommendations about how, when, where etc to read the book because it is truly triggering. I usually read it while sitting in my comfy spot at home with my wife, ID take notes and then discuss with her and my therapist. It is painful but has set me on a path to grow so much more as a person than I ever imagined. Its hard, but well worth it. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about anything/ commiserate in a healthy manner lol.", "Not the person who commented, but I think it\u2019s unfair to say OP should go because she\u2019s like a \u201cparent\u201d to her sister. Being made a parent to her sister was never her responsibility and is a major part of the problem.", "Sorry I didn\u2019t replie sooner I don\u2019t even remember anymore", "When I was small I was the vortex child, because of heart issues. As the danger got less and it seemed like I would be fine with no more surgeries I stopped being the vortex. Not being the vortex was wonderful. I could do my own thing, without constantly being hovered over. \nThen when I was a teen I started having joint pain. My parents and siblings thought I was making it up just so I could be the centre of attention again. Despite the doctor telling them that she knew what I had, but was not allowed to give the diagnosis because I was too young. Seven years later I was finally old enough for my diagnosis and why back to the doctor to get it, like she had told me to do. I finally got my diagnosis and then suddenly my parents believed I'd not been lying all that time. \nLike I was going to straight up lie for 8 years and walk down stairs backwards just to get attention. I still can't phantom why they did not believe me. \n\nBeing a vortex child sucks. Being a glass child also sucks.", "I see the same situation happen in many families with special needs kids.", "Ya raising them really isn\u2019t praiseworthy /s", "[deleted]", "Oh, you\u2019re good, I must have misread what you wrote. Yes I agree OP should talk to her sister about it for the sake of the relationship.", "I know, right?", "It is not about her sister. It is about every opportunity OP missed. It is about sitting through all that and thinking \u00ab\u00a0what could my life have been if I had this\u00a0\u00bb. That does not mean she resents her sister for it, it just means that it is difficult/ painful for OP.  Forcing her to witness her sister\u2019s triumph would bring back painful memories and anger for OP & if she does not want to deal with that right now, I fully understand why. \n\nIt is irrelevant who was /wasn\u2019t the \u00ab\u00a0golden child\u00a0\u00bb or the definition of such terms.", "Thank you, you get it! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe", "They realized they messed up on OP\u2019s upbringing and thought they could do better with the 17 year-old. They should\u2019ve tried to make it up to OP as well. It\u2019s awful.", "You should go to your sister's graduation to support her. But I can't blame you because you're upset and it's obvious that their favorite child is your sister.", ">Everyone always says \"don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm\" until they realize you're the first born daughter.\n\n....What??", "I want to echo your suggestion. OP it is never too late to go back to school. I have taught students of all ages. If you start slow and ease into it you will probably do very well.", "As the child who had a very similar experience as OP, this rankles me.  After a lifetime of constant messages about how little OP or her feelings mattered to her family, she's being told once again that her feelings don't matter and she should suck it up and go because little sis might \"feel guilty\".  Little sis's feelings count more than OP's.  Let's just heap some more abuse on OP, when she came here for some support and empathy.\n\nIf OP can't stomach the thought of sitting through that, she doesn't have to go.  She needs to do what is best for HER mental health because no one else gives a flying leap.", "Exactly!  So many of these comments imply that LS's feelings matter but OP's don't - that's just echoing/reinforcing the same abusive message she got growing up (you don't matter as much as your LS) .  I can't believe the number of people here who cannot seem to grasp that OP is not required to further traumatize herself so someone else can feel good about themselves.", "100% Agreed.", "You have my sympathies. That would definitely drive me insane. Maybe your parents just didn't want to believe you were sick again, since they'd already gone through it once. It's easier to pretend nothing's wrong, even if you have to treat your daughter like a liar for a few years. I hope you're finally getting whatever treatment you need and are able to just live your life without people hovering over you.", "Your families ancient history should not be weaponized against the  OP in order to make her feel even worse than she already feels. \n\nIt is quite irrelevant to her unique pain.\n\n  And, a long time ago, it was far easier to support one's self with barely an education. But not so today. \n\nSometimes Nasty parents stay together, because what other options do they have ? \n\nI know this, because I saw this with my own parents. \n\nI think that you should apologize to the OP, -  for your own uncharitable words. \n\nGo to it.", "For real, why are so many people framing this as OP \u201cpunishing\u201d someone? They\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for their mental health.", "I disagree.  Nothing was weaponized - I merely shared a story and my experiences about someone who experienced similar challenges in their life.\n\nAncient history lol.  This was less than a hundred years ago.  Its very much the present.  Our family history dates back 800 years in our town.  Maybe the original members of my family that moved there could be considered \"ancient history\", but none in our family would.  Your own lack of perspective on familial history as illustrated by the lack of respect for your parents illustrates the kind of person you are.\n\nSometimes random chance gives you a shitty hand in life.  The way you shoulder that burden is what illuminates your character for others to see.  \n\nShouldering difficulty with constantly complaining and blaming others just illustrates one's own personal short comings.  Its not graceful or dignified.", "You do not know me, so I find it quite entertaining that you are taking the side of two awful, selfish and Narcissistic individuals.  It make me think that you have a  quite bit in common with them. \n\nAnd,  no one should have to put up with bad treatment, especially when the bad treatment occurred during one's formative years. \n\n\"Carrying a Cross\", or\" Having a Cross to Bear\"  is ONLY  for Christians to flagellate themselves with, -  that is, until they come out of the FOG.

That's all I need to know about your character to judge.\n\nYour values clearly do not line up with mine.  I can't imagine committing such a heinous action.  Utterly unthinkable.", "Ha !  You know not of what you speak !  \n\nIf I desired  to curse you, (which I would  not do, because it would be a sorry waste of energy),  I would intend  for you to have to experience the horrific abuse of my parents. \n\nChildren do not go no contact,  nor do they not go to funerals willy-nilly. \n\nFor a child to make a break from a parent, means that parent must have done something  Horrifically wrong and damaging  ! \n\nYou need to venture out into the world, and you need  to realize not everyone was as privileged as you are, with your fortunate circumstances. \n\nSomeday you will be chastened, and you will try to find me,  - if only to apologize for your ignorant writings.", "NTA: Explain exactly how you feel, why and how you believe you being there won\u2019t benefit anyone. This event is highlighting another opportunity and support you didn\u2019t have and it hurts.", "OP is just realistic.  I keep repeating that childhood trauma is indelible.  It can\u2019t be forgiven or therapized away.  My situation had a lot in common with OP.  But I kept clinging to the dream I had of being accepted by my family.  Between autism and my desperate efforts to please, my life has been a train wreck and I\u2019ve never bonded with my younger sister - the only family member still living.  I finally ghosted her and at 70, committed myself to relationships that weren\u2019t such a struggle.  At 75, I\u2019m finally free of the worst of the anxiety and obsession with pleasing people.  I encourage OP to let go of these people, make a life with people who aren\u2019t toxic or carrying toxic memories, and protect your precious brain from further stress which will result in a lifetime of mental illness", "I wish there was a treatment for what I've got (fibromyalgia). But since you can't cure it I've figured out how to be the least bothered by it. Daily yoga, different ways of moving and magnesium has at least stopped me from needing pain killers and made me able to function like a semi-person.\n\nIf it was anything else I'd probably not have forgiven them, but fibromyalgia is incredibly hard to understand for people who don't have it. I've heard so many stories of people who have diagnosis and still are getting told that it's something they're making up, by their families.", "NTA. Your parents set you on fire to help their middle child...then shipped her off and used the rest of the ashes to keep your younger sister warm. Your parents have been disgusting towards you. \n\nI know I'm only getting one side of the story here, so by all means ask them sincerely: What the absolute fuck? Maybe there's something missing in the story, but unless they show up and chime in I have nothing else to go on. \n\nI only ask that you are willing to consider a relationship with your sisters. They didn't screw up, your parents did. Shutting your parents out is a reasonable conclusion but your sisters didn't invite this (and neither did you).
