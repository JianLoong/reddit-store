Your parents sound awful. \n \nI would not blame you at all for not going. I think there are a lot more important ways to show someone you care about them than showing up for one day, and if she\u2019s going to college high school graduation won\u2019t be that important to her. I can\u2019t remember who came to mine \n\nYou cooould go separately and not sit with your parents and leave after you hug your sister and give her flowers, and you could ask to take her out for lunch another day to celebrate, have a talk with her about this. It sounds like you helped raise her to be the person she is, and get her to this point.\n\nYou should be proud of yourself and everything you\u2019ve accomplished, and if not sitting next to people who abused you listening to really triggering conversation is something that will protect you and your mental heath you should skip it!!\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know where you live, but I know in Canada once you\u2019re a mature student if you apply for school, your HS grades don\u2019t matter. Hopefully, maybe that\u2019s a thing there? Just because you didn\u2019t go right after high school it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no chance for you to do post secondary education ever.", "NTA. No one seems to be taking into account that you were the scapegoat of your family.

Keep living your life in peace OP!", "NTA. if i was in your shoes i would go back to school to get a better job and ask your parents to pay for it like they do for your sister and if they refuse that would be an immediate NC from me. your in your right to think its unfair but its never too late to go back to school for a better job/future your only 24 you have all the time in the world.", "INFO: If you truly don't hold a grudge against your sister and realize this is important to her, why don't you just attend separate from your parents?\n\nLike, there's obviously a ton of trauma from your upbringing that you've got to unpack, but maybe you could find a way to attend the graduation and unpack the trauma elsewhere in another way that doesn't make it look like you're blowing up at your little sister or jealous of her.", "NTA, it's completely understandable that you don't want to attend and as long as your sister knows this you shouldn't have to put yourself through that.\n\nYour parents don't get it, well let them take a wild guess.\n\nAlso, covid happened, so many people didn't get graduations to begin with, it's not a big deal that you don't show up", "Do they know how you feel? Have they ever offered to make it up to you?", "NTA and everyone acting like it'll be super easy for you to sit through a fancy graduation for your sister that was handed everything you never got a chance to have are just silly. Everyone always says \"don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm\" until they realize you're the first born daughter.", "NTA. Can you/would you be willing to attend to support your sister but not sit with your parents? You can be there to support her if you wanted and wouldn't need to deal with your parents bs.", "NTA.  But I loathe graduation ceremonies (even my own) and avoid them like the plague.  You sent her a card, when you see her be the loving sister that you are (it's not her fault your parents are jerks), and avoid your parents whenever possible.", "NTA.  Talk to your parents and be honest about their negligent impacted your future.  Don't' be surprised if they do not take ownership.  Talk to your sister separately and tell her you are proud of her and want the best for her but attending her graduations will open wounds that you are still working through.   For your own sake work with someone to let go of your hurt and anger.", "NTA. Your parents suck. However... in not going, your sister may think you hold it against her. It's not gonna be fun but it's time for a big sister chat and to tell her you're not attending and why. You gotta take care of number one but don't leave her in the dark.", "NTA It's okay to not be upset seeing your sister have the moments you should have had. Realistically, you need a plan to get thru the rest of her special moments. But it's okay to skip this one.\n\nIt's also okay to say- before sister's graduation or after, but it may make you feel better even if it makes no difference- mom and dad need to sit down with you and you get to list out how they failed you. How they focused so much on middle sister, that they ignored you and your education so you didn't get the opportunities that little sister got. \n\nYes, your parents had a child with extreme disabilities but that doesn't excuse them from being a good parent to you every day of your childhood and ensuring that you got at least 50% of the attention that your middle sister got. That you got the support you needed to be successful.\n\nI'm not saying it would have been easy for them. But they were the parents. Not you. It was their job to take care and raise you. Not yours.", "INFO: can you go, but not sit with your parents? That way you can still support your sister, but quietly.", "NTA at all.  You were dealt a shit hand, forced to raise yourself, and then are asked to be happy to watch the privileged child graduate and have your nose rubbed into all of the support and love that she got and you didn't.

Don't let anyone tell you different.", "Maybe you could go to the graduation but sit away from your parents and avoid them?", "You should go but sit far away from your parents and interact with your sister separately when they\u2019re not.", "I\u2019m sorry you were abused growing with parentification. You were used as a tool to help your parents cope better and you should never have had to go through that. You also felt ignored and unloved as a result. You deserved better. As an adult who was emotionally parentified as a child, none of that was my siblings fault. I will always step up and support them because I love them. I understand the bitterness and resentment you feel, but your sister didn\u2019t cause it. If you were to go, sitting in a different area would be very loud and clear to your parents just how you feel about them, while also being there for your sister. If you don\u2019t think you can, then talk to her in advance, otherwise there maybe some resentment towards you for not going. It\u2019s hard balancing family like this and I get it. I\u2019m 45 now and trying to navigate things. I think seeking out a therapist would be a good thing for you to do as well, you deserve to heal from the pain they caused you.\n\nEdited to add judgement NTA", "OP I think NTA - to cut a long story short, in many ways I feel your pain. \n\nHowever, if you do go, you don\u2019t lose any moral high ground and you could use it as an olive branch and segue to talk to your parents about the challenges they made you face growing up. Maybe they could provide more support to you in your young adulthood. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the situation you\u2019ve faced and lost time/opportunity you\u2019ve experienced. Truly, though, you are young and have your whole life ahead of you. It isn\u2019t nearly too late to change your situation.", "NTA. In short you never have to do anything you don't want to do. But also it is not your sisters fault.\n\nIf I were you I'd probably go and then later have an honest conversation about the lack of support from your parents and the impact it's had on your life \n\nHowever instead of blaming them, you need an opportunity they can help you with. Maybe going back to school, doing a programming Bootcamp, trade school etc. Something that will better your life.\n\nSee if they will help you with that.", "NTA. Your little sister didn't do anything wrong. This is about what your parents did to you. Your parents suck. You should cut them out of your life.", "NTA. Though you could always go to the graduation and leave after... not go to lunch or dinner or whatever after (where most of the family interaction would happen).", "I\u2019d press her for this INFO: does your sister want you there?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem fair to punish her for the things you never had. It sucks but if you want to have a decent relationship with her into adulthood it would be beneficial to support her if she wants it. She may not care though. My middle sister didn\u2019t even walk the stage for her college graduation because she knows the ceremonies are boring! \n\nI am one of five so I partially get how different siblings had very different childhood experiences.", "NTA. Why would you want that all rubbed in your face. It's not too late for you to go to college. Maybe if you let them know that they'll finally do something for you.", "NTA.  Why do your parents even have a current phone number for you? What is the point of interacting with any of them?", "NTA. Btw your parents can fuck off all the way and get bent.\n\nI would however suggest that you talk to your sis and maybe do something together after the fact in celebration.", "NTA why would you want to sit through hours of her accomplishments rubbed in your face whilst you weren\u2019t given the same opportunities. You were practically ignored at the expense of your middle sister being able to do well that you didn\u2019t do as well either.", "NTA", "NTA.  Why are you even still in contact with your parents?", "ESH What about going to the ceremony but sitting separately from your parents? Skip the meal/celebration after, but show up for your sister.", "NTA. I wasn\u2019t able to graduate college no fault of my own after being on the deans list every semester I was there. It devastated me. And while it\u2019s not exactly analogous I completely understand that sitting through the ceremony could be painful AND also get OP isn\u2019t jealous of or mad at her sister. OP is lamenting a life she could\u2019ve had or dealing with the pain of the imbalance. You\u2019re not wrong OP. I\u2019ve been there. Stay strong. Therapy helps me a lot.", "NTA for feeling this way, but I do wish you'd reconsider if by trying to punish your parents you're punishing your sister, too, and if so, that's something you intend to do.", "NTA, let\u2019s normalize not doing things you don\u2019t want to do. That doesn\u2019t make you an ass.", "NTA, but you should talk this through with your sister.", "It depends whether your want for your family to know how begrudged you feel outweighs your family relationships.\n\nIf your sister has done nothing wrong in the situation, yet has accomplished something, surely you should go! \n\nThe problem seems to be with the parents and not her, so let those concerns out in private, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your sisters fault.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult already. Choose your peace above family.", "No sweetheart and I\u2019m so sorry. It is absolutely ok to put yourself first, especially if no one else will. You are worth every bit of the love and attention your sisters received.", "Very soft YTA. None of this is your sisters fault, you could go to her graduation to support her, just don't sit with your parents and avoid them, I totally get your anger at your parents, and it's completely justified with the combination of neglect and parentification you had to deal with. But that anger is only hurting your sister in this instance.  \n\n\nThis all changes to NTA if your sister is ok with you not being there and it's your parents and not her wanting you there", "NTA\n\nIt's not your sisters fault and it would probably mean a lot to her to have you there.  Be the bigger person and go for her sake.\n\nHowever during the ceremony I don't think there is any harm in making sure your parents know exactly how you feel about the lack of support they gave you so you could never experience anything like that.", "NTA. Take that day to go do something for yourself.", "I get it. It sucks when the younger siblings get everything you never got. There is jealousy but you have to understand that your younger sister had nothing to do with your parents' treatment. \n\nIn the end it's your decision. You have to decide if you're okay with hurting your sister just because of your parents' behavior. \n\nYour Parents are A H - that's clear. Your sister isn't one. You - I'm not sure. I'm between NTA and YTA.", "NTA: it\u2019s hard to watch someone be given things you would have also thrived with had they given you the chance. You did well for yourself and you are moving forward. I agree that this may hurt your sister as she did not experience the same things you did as a child. Does she know that your parents set you aside while taking care of the middle child? Does she brag about how your parents care for her? If no, then maybe consider going and sit somewhere else. Congratulate her at the end and simply walk away when you see your parents. If yes, then no don\u2019t go. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Continue to heal and make good for yourself and yes, continue to not hold any grudge as that can become toxic and that\u2019s hard to come back from.", "So, I get your view, I totally sympathize with how your parents really screwed up. They suck, point blank.\n\nBut I do think that, if you're not going ONLY because of your parents, you're not hurting them, you're hurting your sister. \n\nCould you go and sit away from them? Because the graduation should be about your sister. She had nothing to do with the way your parents treated you. \n\nI get you're jealous about her opportunities, but don't forget that, up until five years ago, she was treated the same as you.\n\nI'm gonna go with YTA because you're going to take out your anger on your sister when she isn't the problem.", "NAH. Everyone did the best they could given the circumstances. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late for you to have what you need to succeed. I would have a heart to heart with your parents and ask if they can support you pursing community college or university (if that\u2019s what your goal is). Your younger sister may have gotten that help earlier in life, but don\u2019t resent her for it, it\u2019s the way the cards fell. \n\nIt seems like your parents recognize the shortcomings they had while middle sis was still in their care and have made up for it with little sis- talk to them and ask for the chance as well. They may think you have your life together as is, only communication will help.\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to go to graduation, but maybe give communication a chance.", "This one is tough, but you would risk destroying your relationship with your youngest sister(someone who's success you yourself invested in) because of your parent's failings\n\nESH except for you if you go & your sisters", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Those are in the moment feeling. Dont let them take time from you that you can't get back.  I hope you can grow from this and can't set down the hurt you carry. It is a heavy load, and you deserve light days.", "Your younger sister was a victim also. She probably even had it worse than you in some ways.

You\u2019re parents suck but you are going to hurt your sister by doing this. Just ignore them and sit separate, but be there for your sister. If you don\u2019t she may never forgive you.

You can't just change how you feel about all of this.\n\nHowever, no one specifically, as far as I understood, mistreated you. Things just went as they went. Your parents focused on the middle sister and your needs were ignored. Then the youngest got the attention you wanted to have but never received. Being left alone without love and attention will be few years worth of therapy ahead of you if you want to solve this mess.\n\nI however recommend you to join the graduation ceremony. It will happen once to her, even though it will probably hurt you. It can be a dilemma - how to show love if you've not received it - and thus the therapy could help you to heal. But in this case, you attending to the graduation ceremony of your youngest sister could be one of the life changing events - you put the grudges behind  (not to forget but not let them steer your life, thoughts and feelings) in order to strive towards the future you really want to have - the kind of future where people receive love and attention.", "YTA in this specific situation. Your feelings over your lost childhood are valid, but that is no excuse to punish your baby sister for it. Not attending will leave an impact on your relationship with her, and she won't understand why you didn't come.

If they are good parents, they will try to make things better if they can.", ">I do not feel like it is fair at all\n\nIt's not, but not being there for your sister because of how your parents treated you isn't fair either.

Grow up. You\u2019ve been playing the victim for quite some time now. Your 23 year old sister has had a miserable existence despite you thinking she\u2019s been enjoyed it. \n\nMy younger siblings both got college paid for by our parents while I had to take out loans because I was the oldest and they still needed funds to raise the younger one. Life sucks, get over it.", "I'm gonna say ESH.  It absolutely sucks that you basically got ignored growing up & your resentment towards your parents is justified.\n\nHowever, your sister is an innocent bystander here.  Not attending her graduation will likely hurt her and negatively affect your relationship (at least temporarily).  You're essentially taking out your resentment towards your parents, on your sister.\n\nI can only imagine what it would/will be like for you - maybe talk to your sister & see how she feels about it.", "Looks like I'm going to be in the minority but yes YTA. You clearly say that \"I do not feel like it is fair at all. I don't hold a grudge against my sister\" You clearly do. No of this is the younger sisters fault at all. Its your parents. Guess what this grad is not for them it is for her. You say she will be upset that you dont go. So you are completely ok with making her upset on an important even because your parents suck? If you dont want a relationship with your younger sister you are going about it the right way.  I guess stay home throw yourself a little pity party.", "I get where you're coming from, how about going and not sitting with parents?

You practically raised your youngest sister and you deserve to see her (thanks to you) graduate!", "I don\u2019t feel any judgement, but I would bet it would mean a lot to your little sister to be recognized. I was the youngest and had to go to every event for my brothers and the energy to even have extra curriculars was gone by the time it was my turn. \n\nWhen my brothers show up for big events for me, it genuinely means the world.", "I may be going against the grain but YTA. You shouldn\u2019t punish your sister for your parent\u2019s actions. Your sister may want you there.

You don\u2019t go to her graduation for your parents sake, but for your sister. You don\u2019t want to have regret later on for an avoidable issue. Can you sit away from your parents?

Some people just bring parents. But make sure your sister knows you're proud of her and happy for her because she probably does feel a little bit slighted.

And not going would possibly hurt her feelings.\n\nI 100% get it but isn\u2019t fair to her. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong to you and just like you, she didn\u2019t have any control over your parents decisions. \n\nThese are tough emotions to navigate, especially alone. My advice would be to talk to a professional therapist to help you work through your emotions, so you don\u2019t let them bottle up and festering to something worse.

Congratulate her, maybe take a couple pictures with her and then excuse yourself, so you can leave. Say you have work or a commitment you can\u2019t get out of. \n\nAt a later date, plan with your parents to have a conversation, in the privacy of your parents home, no one else around. Tell them you want to talk. Express your feelings tell them how your feeling, but do it properly as best as you can, so they don\u2019t feel backed into a corner and are more willing to listen.

You went through a really hard time and I get that. My sister still requires a lot more attention from my parents (we\u2019re both in our thirties) and I often feel like the neglected child. It seems that I had somewhat of a similar experience in that it felt like no matter how hard I pushed and tried, it didn\u2019t result in the positive attention my teenage self craved.

She wants you there, you admit it yourself that you presume she will be upset if you don\u2019t go. \n\nSometimes family means having to do things we don\u2019t want to for the benefit of others. This is a once in a lifetime moment for your sister. She\u2019ll never forget how her sister who raised her didn\u2019t come to see her walk at her graduation. Whether you mean it or not, she will likely take it that she did something wrong or that you hold a grudge against her. \n\nYour parents are the issue, don\u2019t take it out on your sister. She didn\u2019t do anything here to hurt you. \n\nOther posters have said it, and I agree. Go and sit apart from your parents.

I waited way too long to see a therapist and wish I had done so way sooner.", "YTA. Yes it is childlish, immature and it seems you actually have resentment and jealousy against your younger sister. Grow up and be happy for her success and the fact she could have what you couldn't...

Your parents had no choice but to take care of your sister.  They were being good parents.  You seem like the kind of person who exaggerated and always blames others.

As someone who has an autistic child, I could never imagine treating his siblings any differently than him when it comes to needs wants and education. Obviously due to his condition there are going to be some differences.... But certainly not the kind that would make either of his siblings feel less than like your parents did to you.

If you raised her for much of her childhood - you clearly are an important figure in her life.  You should be there for her at the graduation.\n\nHaving a special needs child that needs 24/7 care takes a toll on a marriage and on the parents.  It sounds like the middle sister is so developmentally stunted that the state is taking over their care full time - which in the United States is a really high bar to meet.\n\nMy grandfather grew up in Poland was 9 or 10 when the war broke out.  He worked, stole, and did whatever he had to do to feed his younger brother and make sure the youngest stayed in school (underground schooling through the home army - parents and students would be shot if caught).  His father enlisted in 39 and died.  Mother died part way through the war.  Orphaned and basically lived on his own before 14.  None of this was his fault - but he did it because that's what his mother and younger brother needed him to do.  The younger brother went on to get a PHD after the war and achieved much more \"success\" than he did.  He never ended up finishing grade school, let alone high school.  They remained close until both of their deaths - my grand-uncle would never have achieved the things he did if it wasn't for my grandfather's sacrifices.  Family comes first and the cornerstone for all of your relationships.\n\nSometimes responsibility is thrust on you based on circumstances completely outside of anyone's control.

Parents most likely say things like \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, why would you want that?\u201d because from what it sounds like, they have no clue why OP wouldn\u2019t want to be around them. Then OP is backed into a corner and either has to explain why she doesn\u2019t want to hear them talk about her sister, or double down on \u201cbecause I want to\u201d and possibly turn this into an even bigger argument, which could lead to little sister feeling stressed and upset that her graduation day feels like it\u2019s no longer about her.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s try a different scenario. Let\u2019s say OP just gives in, gets the graduation ticket without further discussion and makes it to the ceremony. Parents text her \u201cwhere are you\u201d and she says \u201cI\u2019m sitting in the ceremony.\u201d Then they ask \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you try to find us\u201d and again, that turns into a bigger argument later on. She could maybe use the excuse that she thought she was going to be late, but then again usually graduation ceremonies aren\u2019t that strict about everyone having to stay stuck in their seats as soon as it begins. This would also complicate things if OP still lives at home, because parents would likely be confused as to why op wanted to travel separately, etc. \n\nPeople think going to the event and avoiding the problematic people is the least confrontational way to go about this, when it\u2019s clearly not. Making the choice to stay away from someone is liable to incite a lot of emotions, and of course, confrontation.\n\nI think OP should try to find a better compromise to support her sister. Maybe go to the ceremony (and begrudgingly sit with parents) and then skip the dinner plans afterwards, saying that she wants to celebrate alone with her sister at a different time. But to be fair, OP isn\u2019t OBLIGATED to go to this in my opinion. Sure, it would be nice and it makes sense given their relationship, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a graduation ceremony. It\u2019s one day. This to me isn\u2019t the epitome of \u201cbeing there for someone.\u201d I barely remember who was at my high school graduation, but I do remember who was there for me during tough times in high school and college. That means far more to me than putting on a nice outfit and showing up to an event. I think some people here are putting etiquette in front of sister\u2019s real feelings. Would sister actually be heartbroken if OP wasn\u2019t there? Nobody here knows, that\u2019s for sister to answer and that would determine what OP\u2019s course of action should be in my opinion.", "Yup! Maybe sister can send OP a separate ticket. And then they can take a selfie and prove they were there lol. They can just sneak in and be supportive without being bombarded with parental judgement and negativity.", "She can also just not go because it\u2019s upsetting to her, for good reason, regardless of where she sits. She deserves to take good care of herself.", "Agreed.", "She only has the one sister left I think. \n\nI'd bet money that after the youngest went ivy league she forgot her humble beginnings.", "It isn't a grudge against her sister making her not want to go.  She has a major grudge against her parents,  who basically parented just 1 child at a time.  Op was tossed aside when #2 came along,  and they didn't get to the graduate until #2 was in a home.\n\nI've been in a similar situation and it sucks \ud83d\ude15  What OP is worried about is how awful it feels to go to celebrate someone who has everything you dreamed and worked for but never got.

I do think she should take sis to lunch or shopping for her new dorm,  though.", "they definitely do. as the oldest of 3, and therefore the one who was always ignored and had to essentially raise my middle brother, i wouldn't do some petty shit like this to my brothers? how is it their fault if my parents ignored me and fucked me over? it's not. they're both STILL kids and they can't make my parents act a certain way?", "Not grudge against sister, but grudge against parents.
