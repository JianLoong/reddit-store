Indie photographer wasn\u2019t available so I went with FM choice. We did the shoot, French photographer was horrible. Got weird angles, lots of feet pics. FM fires him and suddenly indie is available. Had a session with indie, was asked how we found them. \u201cI actually wanted to choose you first but you were unavailable. It\u2019s great you freed up!\u201d. Indie responds \u201chuh, really\u2026\u201d, confused. Later, FM fires planner. I think they lied to me.\n\nAnother situation happens, rehearsal dinner. They want to do a pizza place. As long as we could bring our own ethnic food it didn\u2019t matter. Last min FM says she is signing contract. I be sure to ask again about outside food. She says they don\u2019t allow outside food after asking before. FM argues that they are paying a lot for the wedding and they won\u2019t change the place. I propose separate welcome dinners. I\u2019ve stated multiple times that food is culturally important for my side. I told her I\u2019m paying for my own welcome dinner. She states if there are 2, there will be no wedding.

I tried to stick with a cheap design. I told fianc\u00e9 prior it would be nice if my name came before his, every wedding I\u2019ve been to has been that way. His parents end up picking the expensive upgrades. At the end my fianc\u00e9 speaks up for me and suggests if we can put my name before his (his parents are on the top as hosts). FM yells over the phone \u201cNO! We are keeping it the way it is absolutely not\u201d. I get overwhelmed and run to the bathroom to cry. It ends with her telling him to do whatever and hangs up. In the bathroom I think about how I was pressured and rushed. Every time I had an opinion it\u2019s a problem. This is not my wedding. Later I text FM that I want to make two separate invitations. She can make her own for their side. She called her son to give another ultimatum. If we have 2 invites, the wedding is off. I tell his mom the wedding is off. Things have been rocky, I tell him we can still get married, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want to.
