And it likely won't suffer if it never receives these presents, so long as you can afford and have diapers, clothing, and other necessities. The incubating baby has no knowledge that a stuff giraffe was turned away at the door. \n\nSecond, you say that he and his family harassed you, which isn't the same as him just questioning paternity. If he doesn't trust you, that is something to work out, but his family doesn't need to weigh in with you directly, AT ALL, and them sending presents is a way to wedge themselves in and honestly, is a form of harassment if you have been asked to be left alone. \n\nPeople saying you are just being spiteful may have never experienced dealing with an abuser, who often use gifts as a way to leverage contact, gain sympathy from others- just look at the comments here saying you are being crazy and spiteful when these gifts have no value currently to your child- and are used to soothe abusive behavior. I am not saying your husband is an abuser, I am saying gift giving is a tool of an abuser, and you aren't wrong to not want gifts that of course, come with contact. \n\nAnd listen, given the distance between you two and that he was using protection, questioning paternity isn't ridiculous in this case, but it didn't need to be handled the way you describe by him and his family in the comments. It should have been a serious, and private, conversation between you two, with no other parties involved or weighing in- at least towards you. \n\nAnd since your post and comments are a touch vague, I'm ready to get new info that totally changes my vote.", "Depends.

You did potentially cheat while he was gone with that childhood friend. then own up to it and be a better person for your child as you don't sound happy with him. Separate properly and put together a custody agreement then coparent nicely for the sake of your child.\n\n2. You didn't cheat at all. If you WANT to fix this relationship then you will have to put it behind you somewhat. I was really concerned my husband would get jealous about my 4 male friends since childhood (only 2 female friends). I made it clear to him that they were like siblings to me, and I had never been interested in any of them in any way. They are just my best friends. Get some couples counselling BEFORE baby gets here.\n\n3. You didn't cheat at all. If you DON'T want to fix this then try being a little more civil. You have his baby and until there is a court custody agreement in place you need to be level headed because he could try to take custody. Just tell him. Your distrust in me means I can no longer be your wife. Get a divorce and coparent with the man because that child will resent you otherwise. \n\nAlso why wouldn't you want free stuff for your baby, no matter the source of it. Don't burn it out of spite.

Because he travels? \n\nI mean, surely he could have maybe started with a bit less of a character attack. You know, like starting by talking about how they used protection and he\u2019s feeling confused? Or something that doesn\u2019t involve telling his entire family she\u2019s a cheater.", "Well OP says they did the test and if he\u2019s bringing gifts and his family is sending gifts it sounds like they\u2019ve all accepted that it\u2019s his child.", "OP said in comments that his family was harassing her over this.", "Did you miss the part about him not just asking\u2014he asked and didn\u2019t believe her, and he told his entire family and allowed them to bully her. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t \u201cjust asking.\u201d", "this response made me lol", "If a partner thinks you might have cheated, you leave? You don't, like... talk?", "My baby was a plan B within 24h and contraception pill baby. Idk how he did it but he's here anyways", "There was a couple in the news (legitimate source) he'd had a vasectomy and they ended up getting pregnant, after the baby was born she had her tubes tied. And they got pregnant again. \n\nNature definitely finds a way lol.", "I mean I know someone who got pregnant with an IUD inserted, twice. It\u2019s crazy, but it does happen. If you actually think the more likely answer is your partner cheating on you, you clearly don\u2019t trust your partner and shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with them.", "13% is still low. And again we don't know how far they went with contraception. Whether it was just a condom or a condom + other stuff", "Ah yes because someone pregnant with another man's child would definitely tell the truth. \n\nHe did talk to the wife. He asked if its his and had a paternity test. What else do you want him to do? \n\n\"Honey, I'm worried that the child isn't mine. I trust you but the maths doesn't add up\"\n\n\"No, darling it really is yours\"\n\n\"Well you've convinced me\"", "He may have talked to her or tried to.  Unless I missed a post somewhere, it just sounds like her husband was dumbfounded because the odds are so slim. Maybe SHE reacted so strongly because it\u2019s true- she did cheat.", ">If you\u2019re using birth control and it works the frequency of sex or number of partners has no bearing whatsoever\n\nExcept it does... It's statistics. \n\nYou have a wheel where you've got a 1% chance of it landing on pregnant and a 99% chance of it landing on not pregnant.\n\nYou spin the wheel once and it lands on not pregnant. You spin it again and it again lands on not pregnant. You spin it enough times and it will eventually land on pregnant.\n\nThat's what probability is. When the sample size gets very very large, you'll get 1% of them landing on pregnant.\n\n>Apples and oranges- just think YOUR partner could cheat on you endlessly and with working birth control you\u2019d never know.\n\nSure but at least if my wife cheats on my with another guy while using BC and doesn't get pregnant, I won't be stuck paying for the kid of some other dude and my ex wife.", "He did not seem to be interested in talking. He ran whining to his family. He let them all gang up on her. He certainly did not handle this like an adult.", "Yep, I've got a Plan B niece.  Life finds a way.", "I'm an injection baby - turns out around 9% of women don't really vibe with the hormone shot and thankfully I found out I'm like my mom before anything happened to me...", "They better get checked for frog DNA.....", "That's why I had my whole tubes yeeted instead of tied. Safer that way.", "Yeah I guess I should\u2019ve been clearer that I wasn\u2019t defending the husband. Obviously birth control can always fail, even with perfect use. Just addressing birth control pills. Mostly because of my experience talking to my coworkers about it. It was really concerning how many pills they missed or took late or took antibiotics w it and still thought they were 100% covered. Had they gotten pregnant they would\u2019ve been shocked.", "Sure, but it's a lot higher than 1%. I was mostly annoyed that you where making up statistics. \n\nFor the argument: It's one thing for the guy to think it's a bit weird they ended up pregnant while using protection but it's a whole other thing for him to let his whole family to treat her like dirt.", "He didn\u2019t talk to his wife. He never expressed that he was uncomfortable with who she was hanging out with or how often, he didn\u2019t have any discussion with her about her friendship. If he had it\u2019s possible neither of them would\u2019ve been blindsided by their actions. If he expressed his suspicions of their relationship , she may have been more open to taking a paternity test! Instead he just accuses her of cheating out of the blue? This whole situation could\u2019ve ended a lot better for the both of them if he communicated his discomfort.", "Op [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zefgqt/aita_for_sending_back_the_gifts_my_husband_and/iz69bxt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)  he never said anything about it till she told him she was pregnant"]}
