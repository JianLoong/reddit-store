And it likely won't suffer if it never receives these presents, so long as you can afford and have diapers, clothing, and other necessities. The incubating baby has no knowledge that a stuff giraffe was turned away at the door. \n\nSecond, you say that he and his family harassed you, which isn't the same as him just questioning paternity. If he doesn't trust you, that is something to work out, but his family doesn't need to weigh in with you directly, AT ALL, and them sending presents is a way to wedge themselves in and honestly, is a form of harassment if you have been asked to be left alone. \n\nPeople saying you are just being spiteful may have never experienced dealing with an abuser, who often use gifts as a way to leverage contact, gain sympathy from others- just look at the comments here saying you are being crazy and spiteful when these gifts have no value currently to your child- and are used to soothe abusive behavior. I am not saying your husband is an abuser, I am saying gift giving is a tool of an abuser, and you aren't wrong to not want gifts that of course, come with contact. \n\nAnd listen, given the distance between you two and that he was using protection, questioning paternity isn't ridiculous in this case, but it didn't need to be handled the way you describe by him and his family in the comments. It should have been a serious, and private, conversation between you two, with no other parties involved or weighing in- at least towards you. \n\nAnd since your post and comments are a touch vague, I'm ready to get new info that totally changes my vote.", "Depends.

You did potentially cheat while he was gone with that childhood friend. then own up to it and be a better person for your child as you don't sound happy with him. Separate properly and put together a custody agreement then coparent nicely for the sake of your child.\n\n2. You didn't cheat at all. If you WANT to fix this relationship then you will have to put it behind you somewhat. I was really concerned my husband would get jealous about my 4 male friends since childhood (only 2 female friends). I made it clear to him that they were like siblings to me, and I had never been interested in any of them in any way. They are just my best friends. Get some couples counselling BEFORE baby gets here.\n\n3. You didn't cheat at all. If you DON'T want to fix this then try being a little more civil. You have his baby and until there is a court custody agreement in place you need to be level headed because he could try to take custody. Just tell him. Your distrust in me means I can no longer be your wife. Get a divorce and coparent with the man because that child will resent you otherwise. \n\nAlso why wouldn't you want free stuff for your baby, no matter the source of it. Don't burn it out of spite.
