Our mother were best friends, so I grew up with Luke. He is my best friend, and I love him like a brother.\n\nWe are both part of the same friend group from middle school, we are seven people, Luke, three guys, one of them being Ethan, my boyfriend of seven years, two girls and me.\n\nThere was never anything romantic between Luke and I. We never hug, kiss, the only physical contact we have is slapping each other behind the head.\n\nStill, I understand how girlfriends can feel about the girl best friend of their boyfriend. So, every time Luke have a girlfriend, I always try to integrate them to the friend group, and distance myself from Luke to not make his girlfriend uncomfortable.\n\nFor example, we stop going out just the two of us, or we offer his girlfriend to join us and his girlfriends had complete access to our conversations and messages.\n\nLuke had two girlfriends those past six years, and they both loved me, and never felt threaten by me (one broke up with Luke because she was going to study abroad and didn't want to be in a long distance relationship, and the second cheated on him)\n\nThey both felt safe around me, and a part of that is the fact that I am visibly completly smitten with my boyfriend, Ethan.\n\nFour months ago, Luke met Jade. As soon as Luke told me he had a girlfriend, we did like always, and stop seeing each other alone, we asked Jade if she wanted to come. She always refused to come, so we never did anything out of respect for her. \n\nOne month ago, I received a text from Jade, asking me to please, stop texting Luke on the evening (For context, I sent him picture of the manga my boyfriend bought me). I immediatly apologize, and I stopped texting Luke after 6PM.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Jade asked me if we could meet to talk. When we met, Jade told me that she had time to think, and that it would be better if I start declining the invitations of my friend group, because she didn't want me around Luke anymore. I tried to reassure her, and tell her that Luke and I have no romantic feelings for each other, that I am in a happy relationship, but she just told me to stop acting innocent, and leave.\n\nSince Luke told me he had feelings for Jade, I thought it would be best for him, and I began to decline the invitations from my friend group. Ethan quickly got worried, and after he began to ask me if he did something wrong, I confessed to him what Jade had ask me, because I didn't wanted him to feel like he made a mistake. \n\nHe was fuming and he told all of our group about it. Now, everyone is mad at Jade, and they excluded her from the group. She called me one hour ago to scream at me and tell me that everything was my fault, and that I was a homewreker for trying to break Luke and her. I feel really bad, because I didn't wanted to do that at all, and I think I should have lied to Ethan.

Jade is unhinged, insecure and immature.  You did nothing wrong.\n\nNTA but jade is", "NTA, first off, you\u2019ve been absolutely nothing but respectful to his gf and have tried to do anything you can to be reassuring that nothing will happen (I\u2019m actually in a somewhat similar situation with my friend and his girlfriend). Second you\u2019ve been in the group for YEARS so she has absolute no right to try to exclude you and that irritates me so much that she is. She\u2019s trying to make him choose between her and one of his best friends, which is a HUGE\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\nHe honestly needs to end things with her if she\u2019s going to be like that imo", "NTA. you handled the situation flawlessly. it sounds like Jade has insecurity problems that need working on if she is this jealous about completely innocent text messages and friends keeping clear lines of communication. His gf was trying to rope you into her game of manipulating him and if you had lied about why you weren't showing up to group outings anymore it would've been completely playing into her hands. She is trying to manipulate him by isolation and it always starts with other women first.", "NTA not at all. \n\nYou have been very respectful of their relationship and personally I would say you have been more understanding than you needed to be. Jade asking you to not text him after 6pm is controlling, she had no right to make that decision and put it on you, if she had an issue with this she should have spoken to Luke about it and let him talk to you if that is what he wanted.\n\nBut the icing on the cake is Jade thinking she has any right to exclude you from your ALL of your friends to ease her own insecurities. This is not okay at all and I would keep a close eye on your friend because this relationship is full of red flags.", "NTA. Jade sounds immature and insecure. They have known each other for 4 months and you have known him for years. If she had an issue about it why didnt she talk to Luke rather than going behind his back and going straight to you?\n\n\nBy the looks of it, she wants to isolate Luke from his friends so he spends more time with her.", "NTA.\n\nYou actually went further to accommodate her than you should have. She overplayed her hand and let her meanness, jealousy, and insecurity go too far. She needs to own the result of her bad behavior. Hopefully Luke will dump her. No one has time for this.", "Sorry but I\u2019m always hating on weird girl bffs of my boyfriends as there usually is some line crossing behaviour (I made this throwaway just to comment on how great you are as a girl bff) but you\u2019re literally the dream girl bff I\u2019ve always ever wanted, best believe we\u2019d be going shopping and hanging out outside of the relationship and friends group. It\u2019s the level of respect you are showing to your friends relationship which should put you right up on a pedestal and loved beyond belief, you even agreed to stop messaging after 6pm, like you\u2019re a frickin unicorn of a girl bff\n\nThis girl is an abuser. This girl is going to hurt your friend. That\u2019s all I can say. You cannot get into a relationship and stop your bf from having friends ever, even with the weirdness I have over girl bf\u2019s, I\u2019ve never even asked girl bffs to stop texting after certain times. \n\nThis just screams she is trying to isolate him from his friends and she wants him to cave to all her UNREASONABLE and UNATTAINABLE demands because she is ABUSIVE. Please watch out for your friend and go nowhere. \n\nIn fact continue to message after 6pm. Every objection she has do the opposite. She is an insidious and jealous creature who doesn\u2019t deserve him, much less you as the most respectful girl bff I\u2019ve seen\u2026", "NTA \n\nSave your best friend from being in a toxic relationship..", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. What does Luke think about all this? I understand wanting you guys not to meet up one on one and messaging each other a lot of night, but asking you to decline invitations from the friend group isn\u2019t a fair ask. Does she feel the same way about the other girls in the group or just you? If it\u2019s just you, do you have any idea why she has misconceptions about you?", "NTA what is she expecting? That you just have no contact to your friends anymore? You were respectful and did what you could do to make her feel safe, but she asks for too much. Telling Ethan was the right thing to do, you were honest and now Jade learns that actions have consequences.", "NTA, jade had it coming", "NTA...  \nyou're not responsible for her insecurity, but you still complied, even though u didn't have to.. she's not the asshole but the entire ass.", "NTA honestly, I applaud you, because you all sound very mature in that situation. You both have very clear boundaries for each other\u2019s partners. Not only that you try to be understanding, and inclusive and patient. \n\nWhat\u2019s unbelievable is that they have literally been together 4 months!! Her behavior is ridiculous, she\u2019s very much a bully, and controlling. The girl is walking case of red flags. OP This is your friend group, she does not get to demand you stop seeing your friends because her little ego is so fragile. You\u2019ve done nothing but try to be welcoming and inviting. You did not deserve that treatment and of course she should be excluded.  What the hell! You\u2019re absolutely not wrong.", "nta but please go to therapy. just because someone asks you to do something doesnt mean you have to say yes and theres a difference between boundaries and controlling behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
