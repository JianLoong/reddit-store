It\u2019s busy, Chipotle always is. I waited about 15 minutes in line, line is quite long with people. Guy (~40s) starts ordering like 8 things, couple burritos, bowls, tacos and kids meals. I\u2019m checking out (at the end of the line) and he\u2019s still back at the tortilla area, still getting everything started. \n\nI hear the first worker on the line (he\u2019s gotta be near 18, young kid\u2026) say calmly, nicely, something like \u201cjust so you know with big orders like this, you can use our app or go online\u2026\u201d \n\nGuy blows up! Raises his voice, now yelling at basically all three workers on the line. Something like \u201cOH MY GOD ID FCKN LOVE TO! BUT EVERY TIME IVE TRIED THE APP, YOU *PEOPLE* FUCK IT UP!!\u201d \n\nI look over (so do all the people in line cause he\u2019s loud!) and I\u2019m sure my eyes were wide (in horror!) he makes eye contact with me and makes gestures like \u201ccan you believe this?!\u201d Like I\u2019m gonna agree with him!!\n\nWorkers say nothing. What\u2019s there to say? Getting screamed at by strangers\u2026 terrible. I was pissed. \n\nI say \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\nHe says something \u201cyeah, I know right?!\u201d (Thinking he\u2019s gonna find an ally in me)\n\nI say something like (here\u2019s where I get louder!) \u201cNo\u2026 you! YOU are being ugly right now. These folks (gestures to the workers) have NOTHING to do with whatever you\u2019re screaming about. Stop it!\u201d\n\nHe actually stops. Shakes his head and is quiet! \n\nThe cashier says quietly \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do that\u2026 we\u2019re not supposed to engage\u2026\u201d \n\nI say \u201cyeah, well no AH should just yell at you over burritos.\u201d\n\nI told my bf and mom about it later. They both also said I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I think mostly for safety reasons. I think a little public shame would help stop the onslaught of mistreatment of workers but\u2026 over thought about it all day and am starting to feel bad about yelling at this guy. Embarrassed too.

Sometimes you question how you feel because it\u2019s out of your character to do something so it may feel slightly uncomfortable because you\u2019re pushing yourself outside of comfortable behavior, on top of it being hard to stand up against someone. The guy did yell, yelling is never appropriate- it\u2019s childish. The worker didn\u2019t know the customer had had issues with online ordering, he was trying to offer advice to what he thought could be an easier choice for the customer\u2019s needs.\n\nAlso not saying that if the masses agree with one point of view the masses are always right, but just saying that in this instance maybe you\u2019re the one who should re-examine your opinion on the matter."]}
