{"id": 12483, "submission_id": "11t7p7o", "title": "AITA for not wanting to do my bfs laundry when we move in together?", "selftext": "My bf (30m) has never done laundry in his life. He lives with his parents(no shame) \nbut he legit does nothing around the house for himself. His mom takes the dirty clothes sprawled all over his room, washes it, and puts it away. So now he expects this of me(25f). Since we don\u2019t live together this hasn\u2019t been a big problem yet but the other day when I mentioned again that he needs to learn cuz he\u2019ll have to do it when he moves out he said that I have to do it. When I asked if he plans on making enough money so that I can be a housewife he seemed shocked and said no. I then asked what he would do in exchange, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the lawn\u201d my eyes almost rolled out of my head. \n\nI tried to explain that that\u2019s not really a fair trade. He also uses a new towel for every shower (sometimes twice a day) so in a week I\u2019d be washing up to 15 towels with the one I use (could be multiple loads) and he changes more than anyone I know. He wakes up, puts on work clothes, comes home, puts on lounge wear, showers, puts on new clothes, puts on pjs. It\u2019s so much laundry. \n\nSo I asked if he would be helping with chores like sweeping, dishes, pets, etc. and he legit said that wasn\u2019t stuff men do. \nI don\u2019t want to be a maid. I have a full time job that takes a lot out of me. And I get he does too. I don\u2019t expect him to do all the work but I want to split it. I don\u2019t mind doing his laundry once in a while if he\u2019s busy, but I don\u2019t want to be responsible for his laundry. I\u2019m not even talking about bedding and towels at this point. Just his own clothes. \n\nHe said he won\u2019t marry me if I won\u2019t do his laundry. Which seems insane to me. How is that what your basing the rest of your life on?\n\nHe then said he\u2019ll just drop it off at a laundry service OR TO HIS MOM TO WASH. OMG. \n\nThe way I see it, he\u2019s 30. He\u2019s gotten away with murder. He leaves plates of food on the ground. Bottles of pee in the bedroom garbage cuz he didn\u2019t wanna go downstairs, flem/spit always end up on the rug in his room cuz he secretly smokes weed out the window. His mom ruined him. He never cleans up after himself and now gets mad at me if I don\u2019t clean his room. If he gets home and I didn\u2019t make his bed he\u2019s pissed. We had a deal that he would take plates/cups/trash from the day before downstairs in the morning before work and I would make the bed. But he never does his part of the deal so I stopped doing mine and he\u2019s so mad saying that I have more time than him and I\u2019m home being lazy (I work full time). He does this with my car too. He only has a work truck so we take my car and he leaves crap in it and gets mad that it\u2019s messy.\n\nI\u2019ve kind of just accepted that I\u2019ll have to do more work than him cuz he was never expected to lift a finger with his family. But I\u2019m putting my foot down on doing his personal laundry. Am I just petty? Should I do his laundry and let him do the lawn once a year and act like that\u2019s a fair trade?\n\nEdit to add: the spitting thing, he spits onto plates and garbage on the floor thinking he\u2019s not getting it anywhere else.

Yes, you are TA! To yourself! How could you physically type all of this out and not immediately recoil in disgust. How could you not give yourself an ounce of kindness and save yourself from this insanity? He is worth *nothing.* He doesn\u2019t love you. He loves what he thinks he can manipulate you into doing for him. He wants a servant and a maid. Not a partner.", "NTA at this point. Staying with let alone living with or heaven forbid marrying this ahole would change that. Ditch this guy and find someone worth sharing your life with.", "I'm so confused. Why do you think you have to accept this situation? Do you have low self-esteem? Have you considered therapy?

This is not a man to marry. He wants/needs mom 2.0 with sexy time included.

However bad you think it is, I promise you it's worse.", "NTA for this, but a super sad Y T A for staying with someone who is abusive (yes, we all saw your other post) and misogynistic.
