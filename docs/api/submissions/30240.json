M is my parents 'miricle rainbow baby' after 2 miscarraiges, and therefore gets his way all the time. L and I have shared a room our whole lives despite living in a 5 bedroom house, M gets the master. L and me get store bought cake to share on our birthday, M gets a custom made cake in any theme he wants every year. You get the idea.\n\nSo M has severe FOMO (fear of missing out) and apparently has since he was a baby and would refuse to go to bed because L and I were still awake. Well recently it's gotten so much worse and mom and dad refuse to do anything about it, saying 'it's just a phase' and 'you just need to include him more'. It's so bad that he can't physically listen to two people talking in another room and not ask what they're talking about, or let anyone leave the house without him knowing exactly what they're doing, whith who, for how long. Its so tiring because if I tell him I'm going to the mall with friends and don't elaborate to which mall, how long and with who he gets mad, especially when I do tell him details and tell him he can't go with me.\n\nThis happened last week when I went out with friends to see the FNAF movie and told him he couldn't come. We'd paid for our tickets, theatre fully booked, everything. Also me and my friends don't want to drag around a 13 year old. I told him he couldn't go and he screamed, when mom found out she told me to take him, and give him my seat because he 'desperatley wanted to see the movie' and 'surley you don't want to dissapoint your brother?'. \n\nThe real conflict happened last night when I was talking to L and one of my friends who we'll call 'K'. K's little sister 'E' has cancer and it's really affected K, she loves E so much and it's honestly really sad for the entire friend group. K was updating L & I on how E was because she recently got admitted to hospital and they were really scared she wouldn't make it, but she did and is doing better.M overheard the talk and came into our room asking what we were talking about? Who has cancer? Who died? How?\n\nThese questions made K really sad because obviously he sister had almost died and she later told me that the questions made he really scared as that could have happened. K started crying and went to the bathroom with L to calm down, and M followed, asking K even more questions like 'Was it your sister? Can I have her Xbox then? When did it happen? Is she still alive?' and Katie slammed the door in his face. M took offence to this and ran back to my room and told me my frind was 'really rude and I just wanted to know'. I then kind of exploded on him, saying that not everything is his buisiness and to shut up and leave K alone.\n\nMom heard this and got really angry, and she hasn't talked to me today, so I was wondering if I am TA?", "created_utc": 1699012844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mtfj6/aita_for_yelling_at_my_brother_that_not/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

M is a little brat, it\u2019s going to be difficult to stand up for yourself in this but take comfort in the fact that he\u2019s going to have a hard life when mummy isn\u2019t stepping in to force people to do his bidding. Count the days.", "Wow, I would say you could\u2019ve handled the situation better but NTA. Your parents are TA though. I understand rainbow baby (my son is rainbow baby), but God I hate the phrase. Even I get it, but your parents are also responsible not only for the \u201cmiracle\u201d baby but also you and your sis. From what I got, it\u2019s only 3 yrs gap between you, so you were a little kiddo when your brother was born and treating you and your sister in such way is horrible. \nAlso, they are doing a terrible favor for your brother. Firstly, it\u2019s about boundaries. So you two with the sis didn\u2019t go to bed, if it\u2019s baby brother\u2019s bed time, he goes. It seems that parents even pushed the FOMO into him. And \u201cjust the phase\u201d? Sorry to break it to, but if this will not be treated with professional help, when he grow up he\u2019ll be hated by his colleagues, partner, friends, cause no one wants to give a full review of their plans, and also, when people are so eager it looks like they are fishing for gossip. Secondly, it will be hard for him: imagine always trying to be everywhere, to know everything, it\u2019s just insane amount of mental load, stress and anxiety. \nI don\u2019t know what to do know, but maybe you have any other adult (who is thinking more rationally rather that rainbow baby BS) in your family to raise the concern and talk to your parents.", "NTA, And it sounds like the family needs to have a sit down to talk about the preferential treatment your brother gets and how permissive your parents are with him. I work in higher education and the students I work with that have been raised like this have a hugely difficult time adjusting to life on their own and dealing with roommates, professors, work recruiters, etc. If you all belong to a church and have a trusted pastor or priest you may want to ask them to mediate a conversation. Or if you have an elder in your family (grandparents, grand-aunt/uncle) that you and your parents all respect they could also serve as a mediator.", "Nta!\nNext time he wants to know every detail about your conversation Talk about Sex, Menstruation or other topics that would gross a 13 year old out.

You stood up for her and are being a great and caring friend. \n\nMany commenters have said this (and I am sure many more will) M is not your child or your responsibility. It seems like you are the parent, and your actual parents are M's BFFs. \n\nYou need to explain this situation to your parents together and explain that you and your sister can't be the ones calling out his inappropriate  behaviour. What happens when you go to college? Get married? Buy a house? Will they still expect you to accommodate him? Their behaviour and unequal treatment may jeopardise your relationship with them when you are older. Make sure you let them know this.", "NTA.

I honestly think this favoritism as more to do with him being a boy rather than a rainbow baby but that\u2019s just my two cents. Your parents are neglecting you and your sisters emotional needs and this is so wrong. He pushed and pushed and he got exactly what he deserved. If he is on the spectrum it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to cater to his behavior.  His parents should me working with him.", "NTA. Jees... how is this kid not having his eyeballs bullied out in school?", "I like that he asked about getting her x box. It really shows what kind of person he is.

NTA.", "You're NTA. Your brother is going to have a hard time living in the real world. Perhaps you and your sister could talk to your mother about it from that point of view. After all, you two will be old enough to leave home in just two years, and your brother has been so conditioned to be attached to you, that he's going to have a really hard time coping, and you think he needs help now.
