Your wedding, your rules. If they feel that they NEED to drink at your wedding, then they have a problem. You have every right to exclude them if they can't stay sober and well behaved.", "NTA. Tell them they can either choose their daughter or they can choose alcohol. If they don't love you enough to abstain from alcohol for one day, they don't get to be part of that day and their choice will have far reaching consequences.\n\nPlease hire someone to be security who won't hesitate to three them both out if needed.

Good on you to protect the joy on your special day.", "NTA\n\n> I couldn\u2019t decide if they were allowed to drink or not.\n\nThat's very true but you can decide who is invited to your event and who is not.", "NTA. At all. It is not unreasonable to ask people with a story of behaving poorly when they\u2019re drunk not to drink at a huge milestone event. If they can\u2019t control themselves for one day for you, then they don\u2019t need to be there.", "\u039d\u03a4\u0391. You set a boundary, which clearly isn't respected.

You and your SO get to decide who comes to your wedding and set boundaries for them. If you want them there, you might consider a \"dry\" wedding. My reception was in the basement of the church where we were married and no alcohol was allowed by the venue. We still had a great time without having booze.", "Nta. But if it is something important to you that your mom is there you can always have a dry wedding or if you want the bar make sure the bartender knows to only serve them virgin beverages. Or maybe hire a security guard to babysit them. \n\nIdk maybe there are other options that I am not thinking of.

You asked them to abstain from drinking for one day. Your wedding day. And they refused. I see this as them choosing drinking over you. For peace of mind, hire security and make them aware that these people are not allowed in the reception.", "NTA.  My father was a terrible drunk; he would make inappropriate comments towards women and I knew he would probably try to fight my brothers.  I put a lot of thought into it and opted to not invite him, due to the drama and the fact that other guests would be uncomfortable.  He unfortunately got very drunk that night at home and ended up dying as a result.  Some residual guilt on that end but ultimately, I made the decision that felt right to me.\n\nI think you should speak privately to your mom about what your reasoning is and maybe she will understand.  My parents were divorced when I married but my mom at first, was very against me not inviting him until she realized how much stress I was under at the thought of what could happen.", "I hope you\u2019re joking.", "I wasn't the only one to suggest it. It certainly won't be the first-ever dry wedding because of problematic alcoholic relatives."]}
