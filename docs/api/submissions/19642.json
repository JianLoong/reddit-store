I have questions tho: are you currently living in a country or region that\u2019s ruled by this culture? If not, and you\u2019re in a country that can help women in your situation, look for help without the rest knowing. I\u2019m concerned about the marriage. Did you marry for love? Are these arguments something that happen often? Do you have any friends you could talk to? \n\nI\u2019m tired of the weaponization of culture and religion by men that only use them to cover for their mistreatment and oppression of women.", "NTA I'm assuming this is a South Asian country coz that's where this kind of culture exists till date. Your best bet would become financially strong enough to own a house but that would take some time.You could talk to some of your friends who could help you out if such a scenario arises again.Stay Strong!", "I'd blast everyone publicly and start protecting myself by recording", "NTA, but you would be if you stay in that relationship. \n\nMy ex is Egyptian, I\u2019m well aware of the type of culture/society your describing.

You're absolutely NTA", "Your husband is a huge problem\n\nSo are your parents", "I'm not fully knowledgeable about your culture but if I was you I would save up as much as possible. Then when you are secure see if you can either if you want to work things out with your husband or if you don't want to ask for a divorce.  Your NTA but your parents sure do suck for not helping you like parents should. I would also go LC with them for a bit.", "No way to answer this without knowing your culture/ethnicity except one: you need financial independence. \n1- stop putting money into a joint account \n2- make enough to be able to afford your own lease if needed \n3- get a job or something that lets you make money.", "Even from your own words it DOES sound like you misunderstood. Him locking himself in the study is also a huge indication he just meant the room, if he wanted you out of the house he would have SAID the house, and he would\u2019ve been more inclined to lock you out the front door instead of the library. You were definitely able to just go hang out in the bedroom.", "You've got issues and they're getting on everyone.\n\nDo you even like your husband or being married? I feel bad for him, because it seems like you are so entrenched behind \"must resist for the greater purpose!\" that you are letting it get in the way of a lot of things.\n\nI do think he only meant the room, and you massively overreacted.\n\nYou then caused a huge scene at your parents' house, instead of seeing there were people and excusing yourself to elsewhere in the house, where they could have met you privately. They likely thought you had been beaten or something, and then, upon finding out you were overreacting, the super intense worry slid into super annoyance. There's a thinner line than you think between major emotions, and when you change directions, the intensity remains, but becomes some other feeling.\n\nThe answer here, upon realizing you misunderstood, was to make light of the situation. Not accuse your parents of being people who would feed you to the wolves. You left to go back with him, they didn't shove you into a pit.\n\nI think it would be best if you weren't married. You're blaming your husband for all of society's issues, and viewing him as a stock character villain. You don't seem to enjoy being married, have made a bunch of problems you didn't need to claim your own, feel victimized by everything and everyone, and are actively planning on purchasing your own property to be alone.\n\nI really don't think you being in a marriage is healthy for you or your husband. Rent a place and leave.", "NTA", "I fully understand where you're coming from. \n\nYou know you're NTA. You have been culturally indoctrinated to feel as though you are.

Not every difference of culture can be chalked up to 'its just different there' as if it absolves it by default.\n\nDresswear in a sauna setting - sure can be cultural most likely.\n\nKicking a financially insecure spouse out without warning or justification - not morally ambiguous, just scummy and scummy to defend.", "Have a very good feeling that this one is from India but yes sounds south Asian", "Yes it's true that some South Asian parents won't be supportive of daughters walking out on their husbands but I have to wonder at your reactions OP. The house is in your name. And do you have to leave because he orders you to get out? How about saying Hell no! You could have called the cops that he was throwing you out of your own house. You could have called the women's help line. We are as strong or helpless as we want to be. It's really sad that your parents are such AHs. Next time you need space from your hb you could check into a hotel. And he needs to see a marriage counsellor. He's a patriarchal piggy. Do you really want a future with him?", "This isn\u2019t a helpful response. He told her to get out and go to hell. Who cares if he meant the room or the house? OP has much bigger problems than that technicality, and is NTA either way.", "Yes and no. You are definitely right that doesn't matter what culture this is, what happened to OP is wrong. \n\nBut by no I mean that the kind of advice one would receive in this situation by people who are not aware of the culture is likely useless.

You were \"classified\" as a brat who had a tantrum and left bc of a misunderstanding.\n\nUntil you have enough financial security to assure a safe and quick way out if the situation ever gets complicated, keep your phone handy and if things start escalating again record everything. Then leave, at least for a few hours. The recording will serve two purposes: for yourself, to replay when you're calmer if you aren't sure if he said \"ABC\" or not, and to serve as proof in case he does insult you or tell you to leave the house.\n\nIf he keeps saying it was a misunderstanding, suggest going to couple's therapy bc the communication between you two needs improvement.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your house, and gender norms be damned, he doesn't have the authority to make you leave.", "NTA, leave him. He clearly has no respect for you.", "\nComplicated issue as cultural issues usually are.", "NTA but the rest of your family is", "NTA\n\nWow see this is why I call myself a feminist despite some people in America disagreeing.\n\n\nThis is total bullshit.

Realistically he should apologize to you.", "NTA, just a question though, why would the husband lock himself in the study if he wanted OP to leave the house?", "It didn\u2019t sound like he was telling you to leave the house, only to leave the room.

Also probably you need to find new people outside your \u201csociety \u201c, sounds like you\u2019ve outgrown your culture.

I'm sorry this is your reality. I hope you find some way out of this situation or a way to improve on it.

I am on the fence about your husband. Is it possible that he did indeed mean that you should leave his study, rather than the house? The fact that he was willing to put your name on the deed to his house seems to indicate a higher awareness of how wrong this misogynistic culture is. This is something worth discussing with him after you've both calmed down. He may regret what he said, now that he realizes what it meant for you. Couples argue, it's normal, but both people should learn to avoid crossing certain lines, and those lines are different for everyone. \n\nGoing forward, you also need to learn to stand your ground. This is your home too, and he can't kick you out. If he's threatening violence, that's another story: the relationship is over and you need to get yourself to safety and seek specialised support to get out with some security. You already learned that you can't count on your family, so try to find other support networks (friends, women's groups etc.). And put some savings aside in an account that nobody else can access.", "Can\u2019t answer this without knowing your situation. But the only advice I can give you is become financially independent, seperate your financials or atleast have a independent account where you always have access to funds, have a group of friends that can support you and people who you can rely on.", "If he kicked you out and then *lied* about it, you have bigger problems than your parents\u2019 disappointment.\n\nNTA, but something is very, very off about your marriage. Your husband just tested his social power over you and found that it is nearly unlimited. And now that he knows that, he is never going to forget it.", "I am sorry you are living in such a backwards and misogynistic country. NTA.

Your husband is an ass, and so are your parents.", "NTA sorry you were treated like that.", "If by cultural awareness you mean agree with the patriarchal bullshit that OP is having to deal with, then no I am not going to do that.\n\nHer husband lied to her parents to get them to tell her off after he told her to leave the house.  \n\nHer parents are more concerned with appearances than their crying daughter.\n\nIdgaf about cultural awareness, I support OP.", "I will say that when I was a kid, this happened all the time in protestant affluent New England. That's the 80s and 90s. I'd be genuinely surprised if it isn't still going on now.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s what happened tho. He locked himself in his study and was telling her to leave when she was in there. His story sounds accurate", "He probably got enraged and wanted to hit her, so, to avoid that, he told her to leave (as he probably can\u2019t control himself).

Maybe you can get stronger WHILE you work on changing your situation.   \nBy getting stronger, I mean stand up for yourself more if it feels physically safe to do so. He told you to leave (it sounds like he wasn't clear whether he meant the room or the house), you left the house. It's your house too, why should he get to tell you to leave? I think you got triggered by your fear of being made homeless, and you reacted in a way that fulfilled that fear by kicking yourself out. Maybe you could have handled it differently, if you don't feel it would have put you in danger of him hitting you.  \n1. Instead of banishing yourself from the house, you can just say \"okay\", or say nothing, and go to a different room. If he is later angry about this because he wanted you to leave the house, you could just say you misunderstood (the same tactic he uses on you). However, it seems like he doesn't always mean what he says in anger, so he may calm down and no longer wish you to leave by the time he realizes you're just in the other room. Again, you know him best, only do this if it's safe.  \n2. You could say, this is our home together, I am not going to leave it, but I will go to a different room. Then later, tell him \"It was unkind to express your anger by telling me to \"get out\", knowing that I have a particular fear of being kicked out of a house. I know you do care about me, by putting my name on the deed as well, so please just think about your words and make sure I feel welcome.\"  \n3. You could wield the misogynistic cultural standards to your favor. \"asking your own wife to leave the house at this time of night? Our neighbors would be disappointed and shocked that a husband would do that. That's so shameful. I can give you space in the home we share, and we can try to resolve things in the morning.\" Try to bring him along to make friends with couples in your community who seem to have a more equal dynamic, and encourage him to be inspired by this.  \n4. You now know that your parents aren't a super reliable option to stay in an emergency, which is really disappointing and unfair. But the fact that they were hosting at the time and felt embarrassed could have contributed to this, maybe it would still be an option if they were not busy. Next time you should call first and ask if you can come spend the night. You should also determine if you have, or can make, any other relationships with friends or extended family where you could call them to stay the night in an emergency.\n\nThese are just tactics to survive the situation. At the end of the day, you need to be saving up enough money that you could rent a flat if you needed to, and keep it secret from him for safety.", "NTA\n\nYour parents brought shame upon themselves by turning their daughter away when she needed their support.", "Sexist and uncultured...A+ human being right here", "Saying hell no sounds like a terrible idea. That's a situation you want to get out of. Staying genuinely sounds unsafe to me.", "Luckily this isn't an advice sub.", "While i agree with the general gist of your comment, I want to point out the fallacy of the losing control argument. if he can order her to leave, then he could control himself. The \"I lost control\" excuse is just that, an excuse. If the abuser lost control and hit the survivor then why did they stop before killing them? If they did kill them why didn't they kill other people - parents, bosses etc. Abusers have full control of themselves.

NTA", "At least the next time you know you can record him and ask him to repeat himself as you send it to your parents.", "Thanks for your comment.\n\nNo, I am not in any kind of physical danger in my house.\nAnd yes, women can live independently here but its just not really preferred.", "I\u2019m not denying that there\u2019s probably a history of issues bc she\u2019s a woman, but this really does just seem like a situation blown out of proportion, he immediately came after her after finding the house empty. If he wanted her out of the house he would have just waited till she came home the next day.", "Fair point.   But her parents should have been more supportive.", "The point of the sub is not what is practical or prudent, it is what is morally right. This isn't an advice sub, it is a judgement sub.", "Nothing in her post indicates physical abuse ( I may be wrong) she says that he was angry and perhaps she just wanted to leave the situation which is fine except OP went to her terribly judgemental parents who sided with hb. So hb gets to ask her to leave every time they fight? And she must leave? And go where? That's the source of her stress. Aren't you suggesting that she enable his bad behaviour? If you don't like Hell no (don't be so literal), she can say I am not going anywhere this is my home too. She shouldn't let him set the agenda. If he's violent then she can file a police complaint. Go to a women's shelter, meet with women activists, but sadly very few women want to go in that direction and just hang in there.", "I'm in Pakistan.", "You have no idea what her behavior was? They were in an argument and she doesn\u2019t say anything that it was about, what she said, you have no context to know if it was even her fault for the argument. Even in these kinds of societies a husband and wife will fight and no one will be at fault! It\u2019s okay to ask your spouse for space, yes he could have said it more gently but who knows how many times he asked her to leave him alone or not. I\u2019m not downplaying anything I\u2019m saying even by the way she explained the situation this is what is actually sounds like. (I\u2019m a woman btw)", "NTA. Both your husband and family sound as though they behaved unpleasantly. It also sounds like you live in a really unhealthy society, and that sucks. I hope you find a way of gaining more security and independence.", "To me? NTA.\n\nIn your cultural context, where you're effectively the property of your husband? YTA, I guess, for being disobedient and contrary, and for causing your husband to lose face.\n\nI dunno, I'd want to change my cultural context if I were you. Go somewhere where I didn't have the moral obligations of chattel.", "NTA.\nI kinda have a culture that resembles yours where the family honor and prestige is intertwined with their daughter's martial life. \n\nIt's like, if the daughter meets all misogynistic KRA/KPI, she is the ideal daughter and daughter in law and if she fails even one performance area, she is a black sheep who brought unending shame upon her family.\n\nI hate the fact that your husband tried gaslighting you and your family members and succeeded in fooling your family because \"patriarchy\". I am sorry you had to go through this experience and come to face the fact that your family doesn't have your back if you need help or a safe space.\n\nI can only request that you find better opportunities, find a better job and start saving away (do not share any financial details with your husband, who i feel is borderline abusive) so that you have enough to live by yourself if and when the time comes. \n\nI always tell my younger sister to be completely financially independent with good savings and investments before even considering marriage and she is welcome to stay with me as long as she wants because I am her safe space. It is not too late for you too. Take this as a precautionary incident and start saving for your future. Create your safe space with trusted friends who will be in your corner, always.\n\nAlso - if he asks you to leave next time, tell him if he has a problem with your presence, he is welcome to go for a loooooong walk to cool off as this is your home too and you have equal rights to the house.\n\nAll the best.", "INFO: what did you argue about with your husband?", "This is not a cultural thing. This is plain abuse and misogyny. \n\nI am an Indian and I understand what OP is saying about society being not-supportive. She should definitely cut off her parents and rethink her marital relationship. IDK if she is financially independent- but if she isn't- it's high time that she gets started. \n\nOP NTA but you need some serious thinking to do about your marriage.", "Thank you so much for your comment. \nYour sister is truly lucky to have you as her safe place.", "First thought for me as well", "A good question, and it happens all the time, it\u2019s not easy, but it is possible."]}
