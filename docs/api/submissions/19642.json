I have questions tho: are you currently living in a country or region that\u2019s ruled by this culture? If not, and you\u2019re in a country that can help women in your situation, look for help without the rest knowing. I\u2019m concerned about the marriage. Did you marry for love? Are these arguments something that happen often? Do you have any friends you could talk to? \n\nI\u2019m tired of the weaponization of culture and religion by men that only use them to cover for their mistreatment and oppression of women.", "NTA I'm assuming this is a South Asian country coz that's where this kind of culture exists till date. Your best bet would become financially strong enough to own a house but that would take some time.You could talk to some of your friends who could help you out if such a scenario arises again.Stay Strong!", "I'd blast everyone publicly and start protecting myself by recording", "NTA, but you would be if you stay in that relationship. \n\nMy ex is Egyptian, I\u2019m well aware of the type of culture/society your describing. Don\u2019t do that to yourself op.", "Indian here. Your family is a bunch of raging assholes. You're absolutely NTA", "Your husband is a huge problem\n\nSo are your parents", "I'm not fully knowledgeable about your culture but if I was you I would save up as much as possible. Then when you are secure see if you can either if you want to work things out with your husband or if you don't want to ask for a divorce.  Your NTA but your parents sure do suck for not helping you like parents should. I would also go LC with them for a bit.", "No way to answer this without knowing your culture/ethnicity except one: you need financial independence. \n1- stop putting money into a joint account \n2- make enough to be able to afford your own lease if needed \n3- get a job or something that lets you make money.", "Even from your own words it DOES sound like you misunderstood. Him locking himself in the study is also a huge indication he just meant the room, if he wanted you out of the house he would have SAID the house, and he would\u2019ve been more inclined to lock you out the front door instead of the library. You were definitely able to just go hang out in the bedroom.", "You've got issues and they're getting on everyone.\n\nDo you even like your husband or being married? I feel bad for him, because it seems like you are so entrenched behind \"must resist for the greater purpose!\" that you are letting it get in the way of a lot of things.\n\nI do think he only meant the room, and you massively overreacted.\n\nYou then caused a huge scene at your parents' house, instead of seeing there were people and excusing yourself to elsewhere in the house, where they could have met you privately. They likely thought you had been beaten or something, and then, upon finding out you were overreacting, the super intense worry slid into super annoyance. There's a thinner line than you think between major emotions, and when you change directions, the intensity remains, but becomes some other feeling.\n\nThe answer here, upon realizing you misunderstood, was to make light of the situation. Not accuse your parents of being people who would feed you to the wolves. You left to go back with him, they didn't shove you into a pit.\n\nI think it would be best if you weren't married. You're blaming your husband for all of society's issues, and viewing him as a stock character villain. You don't seem to enjoy being married, have made a bunch of problems you didn't need to claim your own, feel victimized by everything and everyone, and are actively planning on purchasing your own property to be alone.\n\nI really don't think you being in a marriage is healthy for you or your husband. Rent a place and leave.", "NTA", "I fully understand where you're coming from. \n\nYou know you're NTA. You have been culturally indoctrinated to feel as though you are. How could you not, when all of your family, friends, husband and environment still upholds all this nonsense misogynistic traditions? \n\nI hope you get to get out safely.", "This isnt an issue of cultural awareness. Not every difference of culture can be chalked up to 'its just different there' as if it absolves it by default.\n\nDresswear in a sauna setting - sure can be cultural most likely.\n\nKicking a financially insecure spouse out without warning or justification - not morally ambiguous, just scummy and scummy to defend.", "Have a very good feeling that this one is from India but yes sounds south Asian", "Yes it's true that some South Asian parents won't be supportive of daughters walking out on their husbands but I have to wonder at your reactions OP. The house is in your name. And do you have to leave because he orders you to get out? How about saying Hell no! You could have called the cops that he was throwing you out of your own house. You could have called the women's help line. We are as strong or helpless as we want to be. It's really sad that your parents are such AHs. Next time you need space from your hb you could check into a hotel. And he needs to see a marriage counsellor. He's a patriarchal piggy. Do you really want a future with him?", "This isn\u2019t a helpful response. He told her to get out and go to hell. Who cares if he meant the room or the house? OP has much bigger problems than that technicality, and is NTA either way.", "Yes and no. You are definitely right that doesn't matter what culture this is, what happened to OP is wrong. \n\nBut by no I mean that the kind of advice one would receive in this situation by people who are not aware of the culture is likely useless. You need a lot more awareness to be able to give realistic advice.", "Sure on practical solutions and advice this sub is awful almost always - most people giving 'advice' here read as if its fanfic nonsense and delusional. That problem would be magnified by cultural differences.\n\n However the point of the sub as I see it is to get a 'moral' answer rather than practical one so thats the way I interpreted that comment.", "NTA\n\nI think he did this, including being a bit ambiguous, to see what would happen, and now he can be sure that your parents won't take your side. You were \"classified\" as a brat who had a tantrum and left bc of a misunderstanding.\n\nUntil you have enough financial security to assure a safe and quick way out if the situation ever gets complicated, keep your phone handy and if things start escalating again record everything. Then leave, at least for a few hours. The recording will serve two purposes: for yourself, to replay when you're calmer if you aren't sure if he said \"ABC\" or not, and to serve as proof in case he does insult you or tell you to leave the house.\n\nIf he keeps saying it was a misunderstanding, suggest going to couple's therapy bc the communication between you two needs improvement.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your house, and gender norms be damned, he doesn't have the authority to make you leave.", "NTA, leave him. He clearly has no respect for you.", "\nComplicated issue as cultural issues usually are.", "NTA but the rest of your family is", "NTA\n\nWow see this is why I call myself a feminist despite some people in America disagreeing.\n\n\nThis is total bullshit. You were being completely reasonable. You left at his request and went to your parents. \n\nThere is nothing better you could have done. Realistically he should apologize to you.", "NTA, just a question though, why would the husband lock himself in the study if he wanted OP to leave the house?", "It didn\u2019t sound like he was telling you to leave the house, only to leave the room. I didn\u2019t make that assumption.", "You are Indian aren\u2019t you lol", "[removed]", "NTA. Girl.. first just let me say how sorry I am for you and the awful people you have in your life. You need to find a room in a shared flat and start over with life. And cut off these people until you find yourself. You can\u2019t go on living in such a heartbreaking and insecure situation, where you\u2019re kicked out and not welcomed by the very people who should take care of you unconditionally. Also probably you need to find new people outside your \u201csociety \u201c, sounds like you\u2019ve outgrown your culture. And for sure a man who kicks you out is NOT your husband.", "Universally, NTA. \n\nOn a cultural level, this is the norm and unfortunately you clearly do not have a support system. I'm sorry this is your reality. I hope you find some way out of this situation or a way to improve on it. It seems very much that your husband putting your name on the house doesn't mean anything for your security. \n\nDecide what matters to you and do what you can (safely) to get it. I wish you luck and very good friends.", "I I agree that most redditors may not know certain cultures but we do know that Opie no matter the situation or the culture should not have been treated like that. And anyway I feel like she should still continue her dream of earn enough money and put into savings in case of situations like this. And I hate families that put quote and quote shame upon daughters who have been treated badly just because they wanted to leave their husband.", "Of course, you would know better than OP, who was there. s/", "Of course, your interpretation would be more accurate than OP's, who was there. s/", "A+ victim blaming there. OP this is complete nonsense, don't listen to a word of it. NTA", "I think it would be best if you were to keep your sexism and patronising bs to yourself, and yet here you are.", "No, Pakistani.", "Racist AH alert.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
