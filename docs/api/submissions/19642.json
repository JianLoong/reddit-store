Being kicked out by my partner has been my biggest fear. I've met so many women who have at least once been asked to leave their house by their partners. That's the biggest reason I wanted to buy a house of my own but I don't make enough to even get a property on lease yet. \nAnd my husband is very well aware that this topic triggers me that'd why he decided to put my name on his house deed when we got married. \n\n\n\nMonday night, me and my husband(28) had an heated argument, we were in his study. As it escalated, he asked me to leave. \nHe looked very angry and I clearly remember him telling me to leave immediately. \n\n\nAs it's already a very sensitive issue for me, I was crying when I asked him where I would go.\n\n\nAnd his exact reply was that  I could go to hell for all he cares. But in our native language. \n\n\n\nHe then walked me to the door and when I was out of his study he locked himself in clearly indicating me to leave.

I have questions tho: are you currently living in a country or region that\u2019s ruled by this culture? If not, and you\u2019re in a country that can help women in your situation, look for help without the rest knowing. I\u2019m concerned about the marriage. Did you marry for love? Are these arguments something that happen often? Do you have any friends you could talk to? \n\nI\u2019m tired of the weaponization of culture and religion by men that only use them to cover for their mistreatment and oppression of women.", "NTA I'm assuming this is a South Asian country coz that's where this kind of culture exists till date. Your best bet would become financially strong enough to own a house but that would take some time.You could talk to some of your friends who could help you out if such a scenario arises again.Stay Strong!", "I'd blast everyone publicly and start protecting myself by recording"]}
