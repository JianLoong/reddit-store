You dont owe them anything, they didnt carry that kid or even help in the slightes as you seem to say. Tell them you will not be opening you door for unscheduled visits and leave it at that.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll suggest a compromise. If they wake the baby they aren\u2019t allowed in. If they text and you open the door, they can enter. If they wake the baby, they can\u2019t come over for X amount of time. Basically treating them like naughty children since this is how they\u2019re acting.", "NTA...You've tried to treat them like adults by making one simple request.  If they cannot follow the house rules, then they can't come.  It's childish, it's unfortunate, but they made the decision.", "NTA.\nYour house. Your rules. \n\nAlso, your infant is not a prop for them to use.", "NTA - Family first. I dropped my family for doing the same shit. Grew up being the one they didn\u2019t like. Got a house started a family, and they act like it\u2019s ok to still treat me certain ways.", "NTA, but I think there are better ways than just telling them not to come at all.  Tape a sign over the doorbell, such that you can't press it without removing the sign.  On the sign write \"DO NOT RING-TEXT ME.\"  If they still ring the doorbell, just don't answer.  No matter how many times they ring, ignore.  If they call or text, reply \"sorry, I'm now dealing with a crying baby and can't come to the door.  You'll have to come back another time.\"  They'll learn.", "Note on the door: baby sleeping. Please text xxx-xxxx to let me know you are here. If you ring the bell or knock. I will NOT answer the door.  Thank you", "NTA.\n\nThey can't follow a simple rule so what you are doing makes sense. \n\nI do have a thought. If you want to change behavior, then specifically identifying this as a punishment might make sense. \"Last time you rang the bell, so you aren't invited to my house for a week,\" or a month, or whatever. That way they get a \"time out\" (kind of like a kid sitting in the corner), and perhaps they'll get a clue that if they do it again there will be a consequence again.", "NTA - and it\u2019s pretty clear they\u2019re crap family. Priority should be your baby\u2019s need, your needs, baby\u2019s wants, your wants, their needs, and then their wants.\n\nThem coming to visit your baby is a want of theirs. So bottom of the list and it disturbs your baby\u2019s needs (sleep) and your needs (mental health via courtesy) which is top of the list. \n\nJust\u2026 be done with them, your life will be far less stressful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
