{"id": 3454, "submission_id": "z75lrp", "title": "AITA for not allowing my cousins step child in the family photo?", "selftext": "TLDR: Asked extended family to dress nicely for Thanksgiving pictures b/c wifes full family of 4 generations all were coming. One teen wanted to play a prank to put up in tictoc. Dressed up as a hardcore goth/kiss character with makeup. Took group photo with them and without them. \n\nMy (M 30s) family grew up taking a big family Thanksgiving picture that is used for Christmas cards. I kept the tradition going with my family. We host thanksgiving every year and its always around 20+ people. Most family we hang out with are from my wifes side since mine are pretty scattered around.\n\nThe past pictures were fine but some tended to wear pajamas type outfits (mostly pj pants and a tshirt) to Thanksgiving. No big deal to me but past picture was mixed with mostly nicely dressed people and then a random few in pajamas. This year I texted each family and asked them to have a nice but casual outfit for the picture but feel free to dress however they want the rest of the day. I even said jeans and a nice shirt is okay for the picture.  \n\nSo day of Thanksgiving. My wifes cousin Sarah's family arrived that included 3 step children. 2 dressed in pajamas but had a change of clothe. Sarah goes up to me and says please don't be mad. A second later, the oldest Sam (NB 14/15) came dress in a full goth outfit, chains, black makeup, and spiked dyed hair. Normally, they dress slightly goth...like they prefer black but nothing crazy. Never before have they even gone close to this 'hardcore'. They said something like, 'hope you like the outfit, I'm wearing this for the picture.' I forgot what I said but it was barely anything. Probably a grunt or uh huh. I say to Sarah, 'they can't wear that in the picture.' \n\nI don't say anything else, my wife gives me the look but then walks away. I get back to cooking for the 20+ people. Picture time comes and we take the group photo w/ Sam included. Then I tell Sam I would like a few pictures without them in it. They try to get argumentative and I said along the lines of, 'you knew I asked people to dress nicely just for a group photo. You purposely dressed like this to spite me and I have no idea why.' It was awkward but Sarah told Sam to step aside and we took the photo. \n\nDay goes on fine and I know people probably talked. Today I saw some facebook posts mentioning the situation and its annoying me. I stand by my decision and not sure if I'll respond privately or not.\n\nSo AITA for kicking Sam out of the family photo because of the way they dressed?\n\n***FINAL UPDATE***\n\nSam decided to call me instead of waiting for friendsgiving this weekend.  They wanted to explain what happened. They thought it was funny I ask people to dress nice and wanted to play a prank on me and put it on tictoc. They took a part of their halloween outfit and modified it to be a full hardcore goth outfit with crazy hair and makeup. They wanted to get a reaction out of me before changing into their normal clothes for pictures. Not sure if Sams parents knew of the prank or not.\n\nSam arrived and I didn't say much b/c I was busy cooking and confused/annoyed. They decided to keep the outfit on until I said something. Sam did help me peeling potatoes and other stuff but I never mentioned the outfit. They thought it was a game of chicken at that point. \n\nIt got until a little before dinner and I pulled everyone together to start pictures. Sam was surprised b/c we had done pictures after dinner the last 2 yrs. They came up to ask how their outfit was and I just said fine (I didn't really remember this part). So they kept the joke going...Sam said they assumed there would be another group photo later. \n\nWell we got to the group photo and Sam kept egging on the joke hoping to get some big reaction out of. After taking group photo with Sam included, I just told them to step out for a few picture. Sams mom also told them to step aside. They decided to not egg me on infront of everyone and jumped out of the picture.\n\nPictures happened, we ate dinner and the Sam changed and dressed as they normally do the next 2 days. They later realized there wasn't going to be another group photo. They felt awkward and just didn't bring it up the rest of the weekend. They decided not to use the videos for tictoc.\n\nSam apologized b/c they knew my wife was big into photo albums and put me in a weird spot. I accepted and told them I'm going to post everything on facebook later. Sam asked me not to b/c its really embarrassing. We are okay now and my wife doesn't care b/c we got the pictures with and without Sam. She will put both in the photo album.\n\nI removed the edit with Sams mom b/c it was just repeating the same story.\n\nEdit: I never had a problem with Sam before. We chat about stuff every family gathering and they typically always helped me with cooking. I would've been fine with their typical goth outfits but they clearly went overboard with their outfit, hair, and makeup.\n\nEdit 2: This is their usual attire- https://images.app.goo.gl/VowCxUTr6yaxbV7U7\n\nThis is what they wore at thanks giving (top right) -https://images.app.goo.gl/Wa4KX5mxNEyR2spk8\n\nEdit: my wife was upset with how Sam was dressed. She later told me she was glad we got a picture without Sam on their costume.", "created_utc": 1669663233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z75lrp/aita_for_not_allowing_my_cousins_step_child_in/", "score": 3273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The best way to extinguish attention-seeking behavior that you don't like is by not adding negative fuel to the fire. My guess is Sam came in expecting you to be an asshole and decided to provoke you and make you look bad, and you fell right into the trap.\n\nIf you allowed the pic, Sam would've gone about their day, and you'd have one photo in a line of 60 where one person out of 20+ looked slightly different that maybe, just maybe, you could all laugh at one day when Sam is in their 20s and talks about that time when they were a teenager that they were insistent on pushing your uptight buttons.", "If Sam really dressed that way to \u201cspite\u201d you, imagine how flummoxed they would have been if you just didn\u2019t comment and allowed pictures to be taken as usual, showing them that their ploy didn\u2019t work. You messed up. \n\nOn the other hand, if Sam dressed that way because they liked those clothes and felt good in them and was excited to be photographed with the family that way, you were rude and excluded a child who is just discovering their sense of style. You messed up. \n\nEither way, YTA.", "YTA - So you're saying you didn't have a rebellious teenage phase? It's a family picture. Not one family is this perfect little image that you are trying to force. In the future, anyone looking at that photo would have probably just said \"yep, that's so-so\", and moved on.

My cousin went through a goth phase when she was 14. Family was horrified at that phase but no one disinvited her from family pictures.  This actually came up during thanksgiving dinner last week. She laughed about how horrible she looked then and how she was surprised no one said anything. We all had a good laugh about it. She\u2019s 28 now. We always have that memory and even at that age, she learned that whatever crazies our family members may act at certain times, we are supportive of each other. \n\nYour cousin\u2019s stepchild didn\u2019t dress that way to spite you. She may be going through a phase. Instead of supporting her choice, you made her feel like she didn\u2019t belong.

This is a holiday picture, not a portrait for your campaign literature.   If Sam was dressing like this to get a reaction, score for Sam because you went for it. I bet whoever is getting these pictures in your holiday cards would be more interested if Sam was in the picture.  I don\u2019t know if you have kids, but if you do, you better lighten up before they get to be teenagers because if you keep this up, you\u2019re going to have a rough time.", "YTA. A family photo includes family - Sam is family, like it or not, and Sam's preferred dress shouldn't exclude them from being in a picture. You would rather ensure that everyone in the picture fits your aesthetic and personal opinion of acceptable dress, than make sure everyone feels loved and included in the family - that makes you the AH. Also, these photos are great when people dress as themselves because you can look back and be like *hahaha remember when that was my style?* Also, if this is Sam's style - and it remains their style forever - who cares? As long as they're happy and healthy, it shouldn't matter and you should be happy to display/see your family as that of the unique individuals that make it up. Yeesh - you just seem controlling and like you have a better-than-you opinion of yourself.", "I'd have used these pictures. They're hilarious. And if they ever grow out of the goth phase it will be something to laugh about for years later. Also the boots in the first picture are amazing and I want them", "The child specifically announced it the way they did to see who was going to be shitty about it. Congratulations. \n\n I know it's not the \"picture perfect suburbia family photo\" you imagined, but wouldn't it have been better to take the photo, and later chuckle about how eye-catching all that Hot Topic merch was, than have all this drama? Kids are going to fuck with you to test your limits, especially step children who are already outside societal norms like the gender binary. They don't even know it consciously, but they're testing to see who really loves and accepts them with all their quirks and weird bits. You kinda failed that test, babe. Thanksgiving is about being thankful that your family exists, not judgemental of the clothes they're wearing.", "YTA. Sam *did* dress up for the picture, just in their current teen goth way. It was a huge dick move on your part to boot them from it on that basis, and to assume they did it to spite you", "Sorry but YTA.  This is just a phase (probably) for Sam.  So what if they came dressed \"to the nines\" in goth attire?  I think in future years, it would be really fun for the family, when looking through photos of years gone by, to say, \"hey Sam, remember when you were so into Goth?\"  Unless someone showed up in very revealing clothing (I'm thinking assless chaps or some such), it's sort of a jerk move to tell another person \"hey, I don't approve of what you are wearing, so get out of the picture.\"  You're making a judgment call that was unnecessary and possibly hurtful.", "YTA in a huge way. \n\nYou know what happened when I talked to my extremely conservative, highly religious, boomer-aged, soon-to-be Aunt about wearing a mohawk to their wedding? **She gave me a hug and told me that she would never ask me to be anyone but myself.**\n\nWhy are you okay with telling a literal child that you are so uncomfortable with how they express themselves to the world that it is not acceptable for your friends or family to see them? Do you know what that does to a kid? I hope you never need to comfort a child through a *family member* telling them they're not good enough.", "YTA for missing out on an amazing holiday picture. In 50 years the normal photos will be nice memories, but the casual but nice photo with one goth in it? That\u2019s gold.", "NTA ! they came looking for an argument, it\u2019s not appropriate for a photo or how they usually dress. the first thing they said to you was basically \u201cf you im wearing this for the photo\u201d clearly argumentative. you asked them to dress nicely, they didn\u2019t listen and you still took photos with them just took some without as well because you wanted everyone to look NICE. there\u2019s clear dress codes for things and it\u2019s not stripping the child of their identity to ask them to dress nicely for a family photo. there\u2019s dress codes at graduations, schools, and work places. how is sam going to deal with that ? i\u2019m 16 and was very alt- my hair was dyed a bunch of different colors just last year and i wore heavy eyeliner and out there clothing. i dyed my hair to a reddish brown and became more mild in how i express myself because i literally couldn\u2019t get a job and i was TRYING TO BABYSIT. no one wants to leave kids w someone who looks like they belong in my chemical romance. it\u2019s inappropriate. thanksgiving is a family event and the way they dressed was inappropriate.\n\nEDIT: LITERALLY ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARGUING W ME IN THE COMMENTS NEED TO READ THE FINAL UPDATE IT WAS ALL A PRANK ANYWAY \ud83d\udc80 SAM IS FUNNY AS HELL LOW KEY", "YtA. Why do you care so much what a kid wars in a picture? There were probably people there who didn't like your outfit either but they didn't kick you out.", "YTA.

You know YTA. And shaming a 14 yo for their clothes as a man in his 30s is truly pathetic behavior.", "YTA firstly because Sam is 14/15. You are an adult. \n\nLet's say you let Sam be in all of the photos. Years later, Sam might look back at the family photos and think \"oh my god, I can't believe that outfit I wore\" and you could have all gotten a good laugh out of it. OR Sam would still have that personal style, look back, and think \"I have an accepting family. I'm glad they let me express myself.\"\n\nInstead, Sam will look back at the pictures and think: here is the event where I was excluded.I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it didn't cross your mind at the time, but the dynamic of Sam being NB and also a step child makes it seem like this decision wasn't based on the outfit.", "Yta I get you wanted a \u2018nice\u2019 family photo but why is goth not \u2018nice\u2019. I think you are making a bigger issue out of this than it was. It is only clothes.", "YTA. Sam sounds like teenage me. Looking back, at the time I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d I acted that way (on account of being an actual child). I recognize now that I was probably testing boundaries to see who accepted \u201cthe real me\u201d (the real me being a child searching for identity through what are some very socially difficult years). YTA for caring more about image than the child.", "YTA. It looks like even your wife disagreed with you on this one. Sam is a child. You're taking their sense of style way too seriously. Family pictures are supposed to reflect the family, including the individual personalities, not your weird idealized version of perfection", "You remind me of that family photo Modern Family episode.\n\nYTA - they're part of your family, you've excluded them over an outfit. What's most important to you?", "YTA.  I don\u2019t think Sam dressed like this to spite you.  This is just how Sam dresses, and they\u2019re tired of toning it down.  Although if they *were* trying to provoke you, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re being a control freak and even a teen who hasn\u2019t committed to an explicitly nonconformist subculture is probably going to be at least a little tempted to push back against that.  Save the nice photos with your own kids for a professional studio shoot and just let the holidays be a reflection of your family as they actually are.", "YTA\n\n\nI don't get why you get to decide what your entire family wears to a group photo?? Are you this controlling in all aspects of your life?\n\n\nLet people be who they are", "Sorry but for all the people saying the AH first they are hosts of this event cooking for 20 plus people.

The bar was literally on the floor for everyone else, but you excluded them just because you didn\u2019t agree with their attire because it was different and not normal for you.

You should\u2019ve seen this coming some day.", "NTA, teens can rebel as long as they aren\u2019t hurting anyone but they also run the risk of not being in family photos. Your tradition your rules.

To show family together, or to present what you want the outside world to see.  Obviously not the former, as you care more about aesthetics than family.  Can you be more shallow?\n\nIf you want the \"Perfect\" holiday card photo, set it up with your immediate family and utilize that.  Stop being so judgmental and accept family as they are. \n\nAlso note, you were SO played and gave the teenager exactly what she intended.  Does this make you feel like the Big Man?", "At the end of the day I think YTA because Sam might be acting out but the whole point of teens is to test boundaries. Instead of asking Sam to compromise or talking to them to figure out what was up,  you visually removed a child from your family.

That might be what they\u2019re comfortable wearing/dressing like and your reaction was a little over the top. \n\nObviously you let them in a photo, but to single them out in front of the rest of the family is a pretty shitty thing to do and you\u2019re going to make them feel like shit, being a stepchild coming into a family is hard enough without being told that they don\u2019t conform to your standards. Best thing to do is call them and apologise and explain that you may not understand why they dress/act the way they do but you shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way you did and in hindsight was a dick move. \n\nIf you just ignore what you did it\u2019s gonna drag on at all family events in the future and you\u2019re just gonna create a wedge with that portion.", "YTA. \n\nYou're only 30 so why are you so conservative in your opinion on what people should wear in pictures?\n\nWhen you look back people have dressed un-conventionally since the 1960\"s. Miniskirts were unheard of before that. Fast forward to the 1970\"s and long hair, jeans and a T shirt was all the fashion. Let's not forget the 1980\"s-90's etc. \n\nThis young man is trying to express himself by being a goth. That's how he dresses and uses make up. It's how he is now.

I kept the tradition going with my family. We host thanksgiving every year and its always around 20+ people. Most family we hang out with are from my wifes side since mine are pretty scattered around.\n\nThe past pictures were fine but some tended to wear pajamas type outfits (mostly pj pants and a tshirt) to Thanksgiving. No big deal to me but past picture was mixed with mostly nicely dressed people and then a random few in pajamas. This year I texted each family and asked them to have a nice but casual outfit for the picture but feel free to dress however they want the rest of the day. I even said jeans and a nice shirt is okay for the picture.  \n\nSo day of Thanksgiving. My wifes cousin Sarah's family arrived that included 3 step children. 2 dressed in pajamas but had a change of clothe. Sarah goes up to me and says please don't be mad. A second later, the oldest Sam (NB 14/15) came dress in a full goth outfit, chains, black makeup, and spiked dyed hair. Normally, they dress slightly goth...like they prefer black but nothing crazy. Never before have they even gone close to this 'hardcore'. They said something like, 'hope you like the outfit, I'm wearing this for the picture.' I forgot what I said but it was barely anything. Probably a grunt or uh huh. I say to Sarah, 'they can't wear that in the picture.' \n\nI don't say anything else, my wife gives me the look but then walks away. I get back to cooking for the 20+ people. Picture time comes and we take the group photo w/ Sam included. Then I tell Sam I would like a few pictures without them in it. They try to get argumentative and I said along the lines of, 'you knew I asked people to dress nicely just for a group photo. You purposely dressed like this to spite me and I have no idea why.' It was awkward but Sarah told Sam to step aside and we took the photo. \n\nDay goes on fine and I know people probably talked. Today I saw some facebook posts mentioning the situation and its annoying me. I stand by my decision and not sure if I'll respond privately or not.\n\nSo AITA for kicking Sam out of the family photo because of the way they dressed?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe there\u2019s more than OP is letting on as far as the history and OP has been judgmental in the past or especially obnoxious about the dress code for photos which inspired this little act of rebellion. But planned family photos often involve asking everyone to wear something similar, simple, and often gender neutral such as pjs or the same color shirt and jeans. Just suck it up for a few photos and don\u2019t be a brat. Part of the uniformity is so no one person is the center of attention in the photo. This isn\u2019t a situation where someone isn\u2019t comfortable wearing a dress and being told they have to. I don\u2019t get to show up to court in my usual ripped jeans either and I\u2019m not pitching a fit that I\u2019m oppressed because I\u2019m expected to wear professional court appropriate attire even though it\u2019s not my usual style. Not every situation is appropriate for expressing a personal style. It would be a problem if I was told that because I\u2019m a woman I should wear a dress or skirt suit rather than an equally professional pants suit. There\u2019s a big difference. Sam was asked to tone down their personal style to make the more formal photos more uniform for what an hour? Then do whatever they want the rest of the day. They weren\u2019t asked to do anything drastic like change their hair color. Also, the fact that it was such a difference from how they usually look screams bratty self absorbed teen that wants to be the center of attention of the photo or really cranking up the whole style with the hope of getting a reaction. If a family member paid for a photographer and asked everyone to wear black for the photos and one person turned up in hot pink because neutrals aren\u2019t their style, I think we would all be calling them an attention seeking jerk.", "\"i even said jeans and a nice shirt is okay for the picture\" is a hilarious line. like so generous of you to allow everyone to wear what most people wear to a casual family dinner.", "They, not she", "I am guessing for Instagram. \n\nOr a Christmas round robin.

My nieces love that I looked so cool lol.  Tho I wish I hadnt lost my corset tank top.  That was an awesome shirt.", "Right? OP wanted people to put some effort into their outfit. Kid put in effort.", "He\u2019s not saying it wouldn\u2019t look good with a goth kid in it. He\u2019s saying it wouldn\u2019t look good with a kid in a costume in it, same way it would look off with kids in PJs or a kid in a Spider-Man outfit. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a place for PJ pictures or Spider-Man pictures. But it\u2019s not every photo. Bring your kid to a wedding in their PJs (over 2 years old) and then see if they want them in EVERY photo. He took photos with them in it. They theoretically exist. But he wanted a few without the costumes\u2026or the PJs. Same reason I don\u2019t want my kids drawing on the pictures we have hanging around the house. I love their drawings. I\u2019ll put \u2018em on the fridge all day. But they don\u2019t get to draw on whatever they want.\n\nObviously if this dress is core to the kids identity, that\u2019s different. The description does not lend itself to that being the case. Maybe the OP got it wrong and this is his new look (sounds like he was fine with his non-goth look before the picture)\u2026or maybe he didn\u2019t and the kid is just being TA.", ">Why wouldn't the group photo look nice if a goth kid was in it?\n\nBetcha DON'T get a rational answer to this, the REAL question.", "If that\u2019s the case they should be able to show up with holes in their clothes or wear 10 layers of shirts. These kids are old enough to know how to read the room and dress appropriately for the situation.", "Moms \u201cdon\u2019t be mad\u201d paired with the kids \u201chope you like the outfit, I\u2019m wearing this for the picture\u201d make it pretty clear the kid did this intentionally and mom already tried fighting them on it to no avail. \n\nAnd honestly? Even if it is how they normally dress it\u2019s still not appropriate for what the group doing the photo wanted. My sister dressed hardcore goth in her daily life but even she was capable of throwing on a black dress shirt with some black pants and go light on the black makeup for events that requested it of her. If she was really against toning it down for the event, she would just not take part in the event. For things like this, she would still have her heardcore chain covered jacket on for the dinner, but she\u2019s take it off for the photo. And her identity was HEAVILY tied to her clothing during that phase of her life.\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t have to be in the photos. They could have just said no and sat it out if they didn\u2019t want to dress nicely. OP would have been an asshole for pushing it if the kid chose to sit it out. But OP is definitely not an asshole for taking photos without the defiant teen who is very clearly trying to make a splash, especially since he did take photos including the kid that the kid and their parents and anyone else who wants the copies can have.", "14/15 years old usually shop with their friends. Nowadays, you can easily shop online without your parents know about it. \n\nMaybe Sam\u2019s mom let Sam to wear goth outfit any day but not on the thanksgiving when OP already asked to wear something nice. Otherwise Sam\u2019s mom wouldn\u2019t say please don\u2019t get mad to OP. \n\nOr maybe in Sam\u2019s mind, something nice is the full blown goth outfit, hence the effort with the hair and make up.  \n\nNTA because OP is the host and he allowed to set the dress code.", ">OP doesn\u2019t even know how old they are\n\nEXACTLY.

And Yes, kids from 14 - 17 can change their frigging style WEEKLY!", "Also, If they only dressed how they typically do at thanksgiving then they wouldn\u2019t have the more trad or punk goth clothes and skills to do the hair and makeup to wear to thanksgiving. Their mom isn\u2019t gonna go out with them and buy them a brand new goth outfit to go to thanksgiving. This is clearly something they already had in their wardrobe and already knew how to do.

Where are you getting sarcastic? They were told to dress nice, to dress up from their normal attire essentially. And they literally did that. They specifically took their normal attire and then dressed it up. They put time and effort into styling their hair, adding makeup, and wearing An Outfit instead of just kinda-regular-black-clothes.\n\nIf Sam fucked up at all, it was being a self-centered, clueless teenager who didn't have the life experience to realize that the point wasn't literally \"take your usual attire and make it fancy\" it was \"don't wear pajamas (dress suburb-normal).\"\n\nWithout hearing their tone, and without anything in what they said actually being rude unless it *was* said in a particularly snarky tone, there's no reason to assume they were being anything less than (cluelessly) earnestly assuring their family member that they got the message! Make usual attire fancy! They did that!! I am So Dressed Up!!!\n\n\"I hope you like my outfit, OP, I wore it just for your picture!\"\n\ncan be read in two different tones for two *very* different meanings", "I don't think it's a \"Everyone gets to choose which ones they use\" scenario since I think it's implied that the Christmas card photo is chosen by OP which is why they complained about past years mixed match photos and why they feel they can dictate the dress code, I think they are doing the cards, otherwise, why exclude Sam at all? \n\nAtleast that's how I read it.", "Weird strawman argument. It\u2019s not a costume and it\u2019s their grandmas funeral either? Some people dress like that every single day, I did when I was that age and went to a high school 200 metres away from the beach, 90% of the school\u2019s population were tanned surfy kids and I use to spend two plus hours everyday before school teasing my dyed black/purple hair and piling layers of make up on despite being heavily bullied for it. The kid obviously put a lot of effort into how they looked and probably thought they looked nice, personally I\u2019d care more about a teenagers self esteem and self image then something so materialistic as a picture to put on a Christmas card. And in your own words, shame on you for calling a teenager a jerk for expressing themselves in what should have been a safe environment with their family.", "The kid probably didn't even want to be there. The thing about young teens, is they can't drive. Maybe they'll get lucky and not have to be held hostage by OP next year.", "> literally ruin\n\nNo.  Nothing ruined, other than OP's need for control.", "why do you keep saying funeral as if that is the same as thanksgiving?? also it is so unnecessary to insult a kid and call them a jerk/snowflake/bratty etc.?? do i \nneed to remind you that you do not know this person and this situation has nothing to do with you? why are you so angry at some random child\u2026. also what do you mean by \u201cruin\u201d? how are they ruining anything", "It seems to me the kid understood the assignment. They did go a little more formal.", "You think that they did it on purpose to bother OP? That sounds insane to me. As an ex-gothy kid, I can almost guarantee that this kid was just wearing what they think they look the most awesome in for a picture.\n\nThis is nobodys funeral, it is a picture of the family and that is how Sam wanted to be represented in the picture.", ">But what this person wore was more like a costume and VERY CLEARLY did it on purpose for attention and to bother OP by ruining the family photo.\n\nNo no no.  That's OP's assumption because OP is making this all about himself.  Sam dressed like he wanted.  There's nothing rude or disrespectful about it.  It's rude and disrespectful to exclude the kid and single him out because he didn't meet OP's narrow view of \"appropriate\" middle class blandness.", "Right??! Thats baffling to me! Over a literal child.", "LOL my mom offered me $200 when I was 14 to cut my long hair for a family photo and I refused. You didn't play your cards right.", "What makes a family photo \u201cofficial\u201d?", "Nice means inherently unproblematic. It also means boring, but in most cases you want family photos to be boring and conformist. That word is pretty obviously coded to what it expected.", "That kid, and their family, are amazing!", "Stepparents and stepsons getting along!  My cold brittle heart just melted a bit. This is amazing.", "This is genuinely the sweetest...absolutely heart warming! What an absolutely wonderful family \ud83d\udc9c", "I feel like the grinch whose heart grew reading this story of How The Sewing Machine Got Pink!\n\nAlso, OP is totally YTA. In my wedding photos, a niece brought a date because she couldn\u2019t visit family without some guy she barely knew beside her. In the pictures, he has a deer in the headlights look, but he\u2019s in the pictures!", "My Mom had zero tolerance for bs out of us kids and even less from school officials being unfair.  I was a good person and that was her only concern.  Woman was a legend", "Pretty sure OP used the word \"ruined\" to describe how the goth kid effected the photo. \n\nA formal event is one thing, but a family thanksgiving should be about family. \n\nAlso, as other commenters have pointed out, OP seemed iffy on age and admitted they were previously a \"little goth.\" It seems like it is a part of their identity, and they're likely just expanding on it. Being iffy on the age gives off the impression OP doesn't know the goth kid that well, and wouldn't know if this is just how they dressed now a days. \nIMO, even if the goth kid over-did the outfit to purposely bother OP, OP is still the adult and shouldn't single out a child over mere aesthetics. Is a matchy photo really so important? It's still a photo, just more authentic to reality. I don't see the big deal, in a non-formal setting. \n\nIt's also possible the goth kid thought of \"dressing up\" as the type of outfit they wore (compared to the toned down goth of earlier holidays). It could've easily been a misinterpretation that there was malicious intent. \nI understand there's a time and place for formal attire, but I don't think making such a big deal about it is fair to the kid. If it was a formal event or black tie or something, that would be different. If other cousins were changing in and out if PJs... it doesn't sound like that kind of event.", "Everyone kind of matching isn't rational?", "They're still kids, and IMO if an adult were wearing their regular goth attire to a family event, it should be fine. Why not?\nIt bothers me that there are adults out there that care so much more about image, than they do their family members... to the point one would exclude a child from a family photo. \nI just don't think being \"proper\" etc is a good excuse to single a child out negatively.", "Thanks for the award!", "You might be right if it wasn\u2019t for the mother apologizing before hand. That shows that there was already some sort of conversation about the outfit and they chose to wear it anyway. He knew what he was doing.

Come on!", "Yes. but Sam does not dress like that everyday. Therefore to him and the family... It absolutely WAS a costume worn solely for attention. why are ppl not reading that part. OP makes it very clear that this is not even close to something that the teen would normally wear. and was even expected sam and their family to dress \"goth-y\". Gothy-y does not mean a dramatic costume to prove how unique and rebellious you are. This selfish teen doesn't have a self esteem problem. they have a narcissitic spoiled brat  problem.\n\nSHAME ON THIS SELFISH TEEN for being so self centered they couldn't be even the slightest bit respectful to the homeowner hosting them. RUDE!", "lol. who was asking anyone to not be themselves?? No one said that. not even close.  Jesus. people learn how to read please!!!! OP doesn't at all mind the goth family dressing goth. he even expected them to dress that way. What he does mind is a full blown costume that is completely out of the ordinary, that the mother had to apologize for ahead of time. everyone is so hung up on this bratty snowflake uniqueness they're completely blinded with how boldly and purposefully rude and disrespectful it was to the home owner. this teen can dress like a clown for a family gathering but OP is on a stake for wanting a simple family photo?

Sam was wearing what Sam wanted to wear, and OP chose to single him out and exclude him, which is a great way to treat family, eh?", "Reading comprehension skills are not strong in society nowadays. I completely agree with you.", "No, what the OP was clearly expecting WAS a costume. This kid was supposed to come dressed as some suburban twerp, and chose not to.

How do you know Sam didn't care or want to be in the pic?", "yes they do work rather well when you\u2019re just using them to confirm your own assumptions about people you\u2019ve never met nor know anything about! but maybe the commenters defending sam ACTUALLY dont care about what someone wears as long as they feel comfortable and happy and maybe sam ACTUALLY enjoys dressing that way. shocking, i know", "Everyone is wrong as fuck. They were before the edits, and they're even moreso wrong after the edits. \n\nNTA, this was supposed to be an important family tradition/photo, and you gave explicit warning/directions of how to dress. If they had come in *just* pajamas when everyone else came in casual clothing and you excluded them you *still* wouldn't be TA. The fact you even bothered to take a few with them in it before asking them to step aside is more effort to \"meet in the middle\" than was required of you. \n\nThat being said, glad it all ended up being (allegedly) a joke, and that there's no real drama stemming from it.

But also said that people could wear whatever the eff they wanted the rest of the day, just look \u201ccasual but nice\u201d for the photo.\n\nEvery single other person was capable of fulfilling this clear and simple request. Why should Sam be the only one allowed to go against the request, when every single other person followed the request?\n\nAnd after you mentioned that you would have been perfectly fine if they dressed in their usual black attire that they have historically worn to thanksgiving, I feel this makes you even less of an AH. Because for Sam, they could have dressed in this more extreme goth outfit all day, and had their usual, toned down but still emo outfit with them for the family photo. They will still get to express themselves and identify themselves as \u201cdifferent\u201d than the rest, but yet still respect the desire for a more \u201ccasual but nice\u201d outfit. It\u2019s not like you were expecting them to go completely against their own lifestyle and preferences by making them wear a blue and white plaid button down, nice blue jeans and some brown dress shoes. They could have still worn all black, like they always have. Instead, they chose to completely rebel against the request and go extreme. \n\nEveryone else willingly brought clothes for the photo as requested and briefly changed out of their preferred comfy pjs. They were respectful of your wishes.\n\nSam was trying to make a statement and a point, and I don\u2019t feel that Y T A here since everyone else was able to accommodate the request. \n\nYou still took photos with Sam in them.

Adults constantly deciding within their own minds that anytime I was struggling or didn't know the social expectation (that no one told me and/or was secretly a second, completely different expectation ...), it was On Purpose because I was deliberately being stupid and rude. Don't you know? Teenagers are ALL rude and sarcastic and deliberately rebelling! We ALL did it! Surely this teenager I'm shitting on deserves it!
