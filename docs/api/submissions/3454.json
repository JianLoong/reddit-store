{"id": 3454, "submission_id": "z75lrp", "title": "AITA for not allowing my cousins step child in the family photo?", "selftext": "My (M 30s) family grew up taking a big family Thanksgiving picture that is used for Christmas cards. I kept the tradition going with my family. We host thanksgiving every year and its always around 20+ people. Most family we hang out with are from my wifes side since mine are pretty scattered around.\n\nThe past pictures were fine but some tended to wear pajamas type outfits (mostly pj pants and a tshirt) to Thanksgiving. No big deal to me but past picture was mixed with mostly nicely dressed people and then a random few in pajamas. This year I texted each family and asked them to have a nice but casual outfit for the picture but feel free to dress however they want the rest of the day. I even said jeans and a nice shirt is okay for the picture.  \n\nSo day of Thanksgiving. My wifes cousin Sarah's family arrived that included 3 step children. 2 dressed in pajamas but had a change of clothe. Sarah goes up to me and says please don't be mad. A second later, the oldest Sam (NB 14/15) came dress in a full goth outfit, chains, black makeup, and spiked dyed hair. Normally, they dress slightly goth...like they prefer black but nothing crazy. Never before have they even gone close to this 'hardcore'. They said something like, 'hope you like the outfit, I'm wearing this for the picture.' I forgot what I said but it was barely anything. Probably a grunt or uh huh. I say to Sarah, 'they can't wear that in the picture.' \n\nI don't say anything else, my wife gives me the look but then walks away. I get back to cooking for the 20+ people. Picture time comes and we take the group photo w/ Sam included. Then I tell Sam I would like a few pictures without them in it. They try to get argumentative and I said along the lines of, 'you knew I asked people to dress nicely just for a group photo. You purposely dressed like this to spite me and I have no idea why.' It was awkward but Sarah told Sam to step aside and we took the photo. \n\nDay goes on fine and I know people probably talked. Today I saw some facebook posts mentioning the situation and its annoying me. I stand by my decision and not sure if I'll respond privately or not.\n\nSo AITA for kicking Sam out of the family photo because of the way they dressed?\n\nEdit: I never had a problem with Sam before. We chat about stuff every family gathering and they typically always helped me with cooking. I would've been fine with their typical goth outfits but they clearly went overboard with their outfit, hair, and makeup.\n\nEdit 2: This is their usual attire- https://images.app.goo.gl/VowCxUTr6yaxbV7U7\n\nThis is what they wore at thanks giving (top right) -https://images.app.goo.gl/Wa4KX5mxNEyR2spk8", "created_utc": 1669663233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z75lrp/aita_for_not_allowing_my_cousins_step_child_in/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The best way to extinguish attention-seeking behavior that you don't like is by not adding negative fuel to the fire. My guess is Sam came in expecting you to be an asshole and decided to provoke you and make you look bad, and you fell right into the trap.\n\nIf you allowed the pic, Sam would've gone about their day, and you'd have one photo in a line of 60 where one person out of 20+ looked slightly different that maybe, just maybe, you could all laugh at one day when Sam is in their 20s and talks about that time when they were a teenager that they were insistent on pushing your uptight buttons.", "If Sam really dressed that way to \u201cspite\u201d you, imagine how flummoxed they would have been if you just didn\u2019t comment and allowed pictures to be taken as usual, showing them that their ploy didn\u2019t work. You messed up. \n\nOn the other hand, if Sam dressed that way because they liked those clothes and felt good in them and was excited to be photographed with the family that way, you were rude and excluded a child who is just discovering their sense of style. You messed up. \n\nEither way, YTA.", "YTA - So you're saying you didn't have a rebellious teenage phase? It's a family picture. Not one family is this perfect little image that you are trying to force. In the future, anyone looking at that photo would have probably just said \"yep, that's so-so\", and moved on.

I don\u2019t understand why people have to create an alternate reality for photos. Let people be who they are.", "OMG YTA!! A big one!!! \n\nFunny but related story. My cousin went through a goth phase when she was 14. Family was horrified at that phase but no one disinvited her from family pictures.  This actually came up during thanksgiving dinner last week. She laughed about how horrible she looked then and how she was surprised no one said anything. We all had a good laugh about it. She\u2019s 28 now. We always have that memory and even at that age, she learned that whatever crazies our family members may act at certain times, we are supportive of each other. \n\nYour cousin\u2019s stepchild didn\u2019t dress that way to spite you. She may be going through a phase. Instead of supporting her choice, you made her feel like she didn\u2019t belong.

I\u2019m going with slight YTA due to the fact it drives me crazy when my child dresses like this but I\u2019m grown up enough to know it\u2019s not about me so I stay out of her wardrobe.", "YTA. This is a holiday picture, not a portrait for your campaign literature.   If Sam was dressing like this to get a reaction, score for Sam because you went for it. I bet whoever is getting these pictures in your holiday cards would be more interested if Sam was in the picture.  I don\u2019t know if you have kids, but if you do, you better lighten up before they get to be teenagers because if you keep this up, you\u2019re going to have a rough time.", "YTA. A family photo includes family - Sam is family, like it or not, and Sam's preferred dress shouldn't exclude them from being in a picture. You would rather ensure that everyone in the picture fits your aesthetic and personal opinion of acceptable dress, than make sure everyone feels loved and included in the family - that makes you the AH. Also, these photos are great when people dress as themselves because you can look back and be like *hahaha remember when that was my style?* Also, if this is Sam's style - and it remains their style forever - who cares? As long as they're happy and healthy, it shouldn't matter and you should be happy to display/see your family as that of the unique individuals that make it up. Yeesh - you just seem controlling and like you have a better-than-you opinion of yourself.", "I'd have used these pictures. They're hilarious. And if they ever grow out of the goth phase it will be something to laugh about for years later. Also the boots in the first picture are amazing and I want them", "The child specifically announced it the way they did to see who was going to be shitty about it. Congratulations. \n\n I know it's not the \"picture perfect suburbia family photo\" you imagined, but wouldn't it have been better to take the photo, and later chuckle about how eye-catching all that Hot Topic merch was, than have all this drama? Kids are going to fuck with you to test your limits, especially step children who are already outside societal norms like the gender binary. They don't even know it consciously, but they're testing to see who really loves and accepts them with all their quirks and weird bits. You kinda failed that test, babe. Thanksgiving is about being thankful that your family exists, not judgemental of the clothes they're wearing.", "YTA. Sam *did* dress up for the picture, just in their current teen goth way. It was a huge dick move on your part to boot them from it on that basis, and to assume they did it to spite you", "Sorry but YTA.  This is just a phase (probably) for Sam.  So what if they came dressed \"to the nines\" in goth attire?  I think in future years, it would be really fun for the family, when looking through photos of years gone by, to say, \"hey Sam, remember when you were so into Goth?\"  Unless someone showed up in very revealing clothing (I'm thinking assless chaps or some such), it's sort of a jerk move to tell another person \"hey, I don't approve of what you are wearing, so get out of the picture.\"  You're making a judgment call that was unnecessary and possibly hurtful.", "YTA in a huge way. \n\nYou know what happened when I talked to my extremely conservative, highly religious, boomer-aged, soon-to-be Aunt about wearing a mohawk to their wedding? **She gave me a hug and told me that she would never ask me to be anyone but myself.**\n\nWhy are you okay with telling a literal child that you are so uncomfortable with how they express themselves to the world that it is not acceptable for your friends or family to see them? Do you know what that does to a kid? I hope you never need to comfort a child through a *family member* telling them they're not good enough.", "YTA for missing out on an amazing holiday picture. In 50 years the normal photos will be nice memories, but the casual but nice photo with one goth in it? That\u2019s gold.", "NTA ! they came looking for an argument, it\u2019s not appropriate for a photo or how they usually dress. the first thing they said to you was basically \u201cf you im wearing this for the photo\u201d clearly argumentative. you asked them to dress nicely, they didn\u2019t listen and you still took photos with them just took some without as well because you wanted everyone to look NICE. there\u2019s clear dress codes for things and it\u2019s not stripping the child of their identity to ask them to dress nicely for a family photo. there\u2019s dress codes at graduations, schools, and work places. how is sam going to deal with that ? i\u2019m 16 and was very alt- my hair was dyed a bunch of different colors just last year and i wore heavy eyeliner and out there clothing. i dyed my hair to a reddish brown and became more mild in how i express myself because i literally couldn\u2019t get a job and i was TRYING TO BABYSIT. no one wants to leave kids w someone who looks like they belong in my chemical romance. it\u2019s inappropriate. thanksgiving is a family event and the way they dressed was inappropriate.", "YtA. Why do you care so much what a kid wars in a picture? There were probably people there who didn't like your outfit either but they didn't kick you out.", "YTA. People are more important than an aesthetic.", "YTA \n\nIn 5 years, the only person who would\u2019ve been embarrassed by that photo is Sam lol act your age ffs", "> I stand by my decision\n\nSo why post here, then? You know YTA. And shaming a 14 yo for their clothes as a man in his 30s is truly pathetic behavior.", "YTA firstly because Sam is 14/15. You are an adult. \n\nLet's say you let Sam be in all of the photos. Years later, Sam might look back at the family photos and think \"oh my god, I can't believe that outfit I wore\" and you could have all gotten a good laugh out of it. OR Sam would still have that personal style, look back, and think \"I have an accepting family. I'm glad they let me express myself.\"\n\nInstead, Sam will look back at the pictures and think: here is the event where I was excluded.I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it didn't cross your mind at the time, but the dynamic of Sam being NB and also a step child makes it seem like this decision wasn't based on the outfit.", "Yta I get you wanted a \u2018nice\u2019 family photo but why is goth not \u2018nice\u2019. I think you are making a bigger issue out of this than it was. It is only clothes.", "YTA. Sam sounds like teenage me. Looking back, at the time I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d I acted that way (on account of being an actual child). I recognize now that I was probably testing boundaries to see who accepted \u201cthe real me\u201d (the real me being a child searching for identity through what are some very socially difficult years). YTA for caring more about image than the child.", "YTA. It looks like even your wife disagreed with you on this one. Sam is a child. You're taking their sense of style way too seriously. Family pictures are supposed to reflect the family, including the individual personalities, not your weird idealized version of perfection", "You remind me of that family photo Modern Family episode.\n\nYTA - they're part of your family, you've excluded them over an outfit. What's most important to you?", "YTA.  I don\u2019t think Sam dressed like this to spite you.  This is just how Sam dresses, and they\u2019re tired of toning it down.  Although if they *were* trying to provoke you, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re being a control freak and even a teen who hasn\u2019t committed to an explicitly nonconformist subculture is probably going to be at least a little tempted to push back against that.  Save the nice photos with your own kids for a professional studio shoot and just let the holidays be a reflection of your family as they actually are.", "YTA\n\n\nI don't get why you get to decide what your entire family wears to a group photo?? Are you this controlling in all aspects of your life?\n\n\nLet people be who they are", "Sorry but for all the people saying the AH first they are hosts of this event cooking for 20 plus people.  Their home there rules.  Requesting nice outfits usually doesn't mean eccentric behavior.  I'm gonna get down voted but NTA.  Even their mom said \"don't be mad.\" So she knew they were pushing the limits.  Mom of kid can instill some manners about being guests when op is doing that much work cooking.", "YTA for shitting on a CHILD for their style. Absolutely horrible and mean", "YTA. The bar was literally on the floor for everyone else, but you excluded them just because you didn\u2019t agree with their attire because it was different and not normal for you. Sam is a kid, and you even said in another comment that their family has a goth sense of style. You should\u2019ve seen this coming some day.", "NTA, teens can rebel as long as they aren\u2019t hurting anyone but they also run the risk of not being in family photos. Your tradition your rules. He knew this might happen and I doubt he really cares. At least you took a full family photo for others but the picture on your Christmas card is special. Stand by your decision.", "NTA\n\nSam was included in pictures, there were a few they were asked to sit out.\n\nAs OP was planning this for Christmas cards, I understand the POV.\n\nIt sounded like they just wanted to be edgy and shocking for the card, teenage shit. Doesn't mean OP has to accept it.", "NTA - they took pics with Sam included and also without.", "you not the ass hole. IDC about coming into style like some of these people said. Its a family photo and goth not on the menu. My grandma would of had a fit.. You was right on getting some pictures without because you gave them a warniing this what is was. They could of came normal then switched to goth", "A photograph is merely a moment in time of a specific event at a specific time. The rebellious teenager will adapt but new ones will be added. Instead, let your photograph reflect the reality that your family lives in instead of the image you hope to see.", "NTA. You did take some with Sam, so they weren't completely excluded. I don't see how you're an AH for not including them in all of them when you specifically asked everybody to wear something nice.", ">This year I texted each family and asked them to have a nice but casual outfit for the picture\n\nA big Haha! for the malicious compliance by Sam, well played.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You just sound argumentative and judgey here. You asked people to not wear pajamas; this kid didn't wear pajamas.

Like, what if they were pentecostal or something? THEN what would you do?", "NTA. Sam knew what they were doing based on your example pics.", "YTA\n\nSo, what is the point of this photo?  To show family together, or to present what you want the outside world to see.  Obviously not the former, as you care more about aesthetics than family.  Can you be more shallow?\n\nIf you want the \"Perfect\" holiday card photo, set it up with your immediate family and utilize that.  Stop being so judgmental and accept family as they are. \n\nAlso note, you were SO played and gave the teenager exactly what she intended.  Does this make you feel like the Big Man?", "At the end of the day I think YTA because Sam might be acting out but the whole point of teens is to test boundaries. Instead of asking Sam to compromise or talking to them to figure out what was up,  you visually removed a child from your family. Even if Sam's reasoning is that you were being a prig, you told them that you only liked them as long as they do what you talk them to do. Edit: a word.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nIt might just be a phase that they\u2019re in and would have made good pictures to bring up further down the line. That might be what they\u2019re comfortable wearing/dressing like and your reaction was a little over the top. \n\nObviously you let them in a photo, but to single them out in front of the rest of the family is a pretty shitty thing to do and you\u2019re going to make them feel like shit, being a stepchild coming into a family is hard enough without being told that they don\u2019t conform to your standards. Best thing to do is call them and apologise and explain that you may not understand why they dress/act the way they do but you shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way you did and in hindsight was a dick move. \n\nIf you just ignore what you did it\u2019s gonna drag on at all family events in the future and you\u2019re just gonna create a wedge with that portion.", "YTA. \n\nYou're only 30 so why are you so conservative in your opinion on what people should wear in pictures?\n\nWhen you look back people have dressed un-conventionally since the 1960\"s. Miniskirts were unheard of before that. Fast forward to the 1970\"s and long hair, jeans and a T shirt was all the fashion. Let's not forget the 1980\"s-90's etc. \n\nThis young man is trying to express himself by being a goth. That's how he dresses and uses make up. It's how he is now. One day he'll be a grown up and will laugh at his pictures.  \n\nWhy dictate what people should wear in a family photo....it's who they are. Wearing pj's and goth alike.", "sam sounds cool as hell.

Considered dressing nicely according to OP.\n\nGoth outfit that Sam probably spent a decent amount of time putting together? Not considered dressing nicely according to OP. \n\nYou said yourself Sam dressed at least slightly goth in the past. Why is it suddenly an issue? All you did was tell them that because they didn't meet your aesthetic that they needed to be excluded from **family** photos.\n\nTwo things are probably going to happen. Sam is either going to stop expressing themselves and force a smile for future photos. It'll be clear looking back how unhappy they are in the pictures.

I mean really, who cares?", "NTA\n\nNo way. Because the bottom line is, this is your picture.  You requested a lite dress code for your picture, that you organize every year. Sam chose to disregard and disrespect.  You even included them in a group pic. \n\nIt is your thing you do every year. You have the right to request whatever you want.

I kept the tradition going with my family. We host thanksgiving every year and its always around 20+ people. Most family we hang out with are from my wifes side since mine are pretty scattered around.\n\nThe past pictures were fine but some tended to wear pajamas type outfits (mostly pj pants and a tshirt) to Thanksgiving. No big deal to me but past picture was mixed with mostly nicely dressed people and then a random few in pajamas. This year I texted each family and asked them to have a nice but casual outfit for the picture but feel free to dress however they want the rest of the day. I even said jeans and a nice shirt is okay for the picture.  \n\nSo day of Thanksgiving. My wifes cousin Sarah's family arrived that included 3 step children. 2 dressed in pajamas but had a change of clothe. Sarah goes up to me and says please don't be mad. A second later, the oldest Sam (NB 14/15) came dress in a full goth outfit, chains, black makeup, and spiked dyed hair. Normally, they dress slightly goth...like they prefer black but nothing crazy. Never before have they even gone close to this 'hardcore'. They said something like, 'hope you like the outfit, I'm wearing this for the picture.' I forgot what I said but it was barely anything. Probably a grunt or uh huh. I say to Sarah, 'they can't wear that in the picture.' \n\nI don't say anything else, my wife gives me the look but then walks away. I get back to cooking for the 20+ people. Picture time comes and we take the group photo w/ Sam included. Then I tell Sam I would like a few pictures without them in it. They try to get argumentative and I said along the lines of, 'you knew I asked people to dress nicely just for a group photo. You purposely dressed like this to spite me and I have no idea why.' It was awkward but Sarah told Sam to step aside and we took the photo. \n\nDay goes on fine and I know people probably talked. Today I saw some facebook posts mentioning the situation and its annoying me. I stand by my decision and not sure if I'll respond privately or not.\n\nSo AITA for kicking Sam out of the family photo because of the way they dressed?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe there\u2019s more than OP is letting on as far as the history and OP has been judgmental in the past or especially obnoxious about the dress code for photos which inspired this little act of rebellion. But planned family photos often involve asking everyone to wear something similar, simple, and often gender neutral such as pjs or the same color shirt and jeans. Just suck it up for a few photos and don\u2019t be a brat. Part of the uniformity is so no one person is the center of attention in the photo. This isn\u2019t a situation where someone isn\u2019t comfortable wearing a dress and being told they have to. I don\u2019t get to show up to court in my usual ripped jeans either and I\u2019m not pitching a fit that I\u2019m oppressed because I\u2019m expected to wear professional court appropriate attire even though it\u2019s not my usual style. Not every situation is appropriate for expressing a personal style. It would be a problem if I was told that because I\u2019m a woman I should wear a dress or skirt suit rather than an equally professional pants suit. There\u2019s a big difference. Sam was asked to tone down their personal style to make the more formal photos more uniform for what an hour? Then do whatever they want the rest of the day. They weren\u2019t asked to do anything drastic like change their hair color. Also, the fact that it was such a difference from how they usually look screams bratty self absorbed teen that wants to be the center of attention of the photo or really cranking up the whole style with the hope of getting a reaction. If a family member paid for a photographer and asked everyone to wear black for the photos and one person turned up in hot pink because neutrals aren\u2019t their style, I think we would all be calling them an attention seeking jerk.", "\"i even said jeans and a nice shirt is okay for the picture\" is a hilarious line. like so generous of you to allow everyone to wear what most people wear to a casual family dinner.", "They, not she", "I am guessing for Instagram. \n\nOr a Christmas round robin.

This requesting having a dress code for a family dinner in a house (even for small children) is faintly ridiculous.\n\nAnd yes, this may well be stroppy teenagerdom but the reaction was absolutely unnecessary.\n\n\nReally good point about the step kid bit.

The cousin told the other old ladies to leave him alone. She preferred him in church. Cousin and her friend would always give him hugs and make him feel wanted. Now did they like him dressed like that? No they didn't. They just wanted him in church and let God take care of how he dressed.

I do hold teenagers to that standard, because personally I and many other people would text to check after knowing thered be photos taken. teenagers arent stupid hormonal uncaring people. we understand social etiquette and expectations(at least some of us) granted i am 16 and sam is 14-15 but there\u2019s not much difference there really.
