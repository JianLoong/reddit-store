I've dated casually but always give them the disclaimer that I don't want anything serious. I started seeing Alicia (F 27) a few months ago, and we get along amazing. I told her in the beginning that I was looking for a FWB and won't be ready for a serious relationship until my son is at least 12 (he's now 5). She said she's looking for the same thing.. \n\nWe went from just having sex to developing more of a friendship because we genuinely get along so well. I see Alicia whenever my son is with his mother, go to the movies, game together, go for dinners. I never stay over or let her stay over though. I feel like that's relationship territory, but sometimes we fall asleep at each other's house till like 3am before driving home. I see us as really really good pals who occasionally sleep together. I'd asked Alicia a few weeks back if she wanted to be my plus 1 to a buddy's wedding and she said yes. But yesterday she sent me this [video](https://www.tiktok.com/@jilquill/video/7278501043967659269?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7279065199986017798). It's basically a tiktok of a poem about being stuck in a situationship, and I was so caught off guard???\n\nI did some snooping and there doesn't appear to be too many likes on the video and the poster isn't one of those famous tiktokers so I doubt it appeared on Alicia's page organically, so she must've been searching for \"situationships\" or videos in a similar vein? And no, i know she did not write it herself because... grammar and spelling is not her strongest suit lol. My guess is she sought out videos on situationships or catching feelings on tiktok and sent me one as a \"hint\"? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway I ended up telling her that maybe coming to the wedding as my plus 1 is not a good idea and crossing too many boundaries, and she hasn't spoken to me since. I've been texting her to ask to talk about it, but she hasn't responded and has since reposted that poem on her instagram. I'd like to apologize if I gave her the wrong impression, but I thought we were in agreement of our FWB situation. Did I tip the scales with the wedding invite? AITA?

What you describe doesn\u2019t sound like a FWB situation.  It may have started that way, but now spend all your free time with her, go on dates, stay at her house so late you fall asleep, you invite her to events, etc.  Sounds like dating.  Or maybe you used to be dating her.  Either way, she needs to work on her communication and you need to work on maintaining your boundaries if you don\u2019t want a girlfriend.", "I think NAH. I was never good at FWB or situationships personally so I could be off, but it sounds like the lines got blurred by both of you. You don't want something serious so no sleepovers, but sleeping over until almost early morning is okay? You're not serious but taking her to a wedding as your date (presumably around your family or close friends) is okay? These are mixed messages.\n\nI think you were right to pull back, but she's also not an AH for taking some time/space. I would stop hanging out with her assuming she wants more and you don't.", "NAH... \n\nI will be honest, though. I think your whole approach (and hers) is foolish. Have you been exclusively with her for a while now? You stay till 3 am but not overnight??? You basically act exactly like a couple but refuse to acknowledge it. \n\nThat is dangerous behavior. Just admit you are dateing and set some take it super slow ground rules and move on.", "On the fence here. Seems like you've got yourself a bit of a situation. You've been pretty clear from the get-go that you're all about that FWB life, and you and Alicia seemed to be on the same page. But, as we all know, feelings can be sneaky little buggers.\n\nThat TikTok video Alicia sent you, along with her Instagram repost, definitely hints at her catching some feels. I mean, she might have just really loved that poem, but come on, we all know what's up.\n\nNow, about that wedding invite - it's understandable that you thought it might be pushing the FWB boundaries. But here's the thing, bro, you could've handled it a bit more delicately. Ghosting and not responding to your texts, reposting the poem, that's some classic \"I'm feeling hurt\" behavior.\n\nYou're not necessarily the \"asshole\" here, but some communication is in order. Apologize for any confusion, and have an honest convo with her. Maybe you can salvage the friendship side of things. After all, being pals who occasionally sleep together can be a pretty sweet deal if both parties are on board.\"\n\nHope it works out.\n\nEdit: words", "NAH - although you do seem obnoxious as shit. I would not want to deal with you personally, but it does not sound like either of you were assholes too each other.\n\nSounds like she caught feelings and was tired of your confusing signals. This is probably the end of that relationship.\n\nPersonal advice from me, you seem a bit confused on your priorities. So take some time to think about what you want from a relationship.\n\nTo me, on paper: \u201cI am not bringing girls over to meet my son because he is too young, I am only dating when the ex has custody\u201d is a great idea and you should stick to it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have any serious relationships until my son is 12, just casual flings.\u201d Seems insane and not based on anything. \n\nIf you are not looking for a long term partner because that is just not what you want that is fine. But it seems like you are in a weird place of half seeking a partner and half pretending you cannot have one.", "I vote NAH. Personally, I think inviting to a wedding is saying you are more than just FWB, especially if it\u2019s for family or friends. My guess is she thought this was a step towards more, and sent the post to gauge your reaction since nothing was communicated about the situation. Maybe she feels more, maybe she was fine with staying FWB. But either way, your communication skills need some work. Give her some time to think on how she wants to go forward, this may not be what she wants anymore. If she agrees to stay FWB, both of you need to agree on limits going forward, obviously no more wedding invites.", "NAH. She caught feelings. That's not surprising, considering the type of relationship you have.\n\nInfo: why on earth are you planning on waiting until your son is 12 to date? I'm the child of divorced parents who both dated other people while I grew up, and I honestly don't understand your aversion to getting a stable partner.", "YTA for inviting her to the wedding in the first place. FWB don't do that. Wedding represent commitments, even being invited to one is a special sentiment. What was your plan on introducing her to your friends at this wedding? \"Here is the woman who is important enough for me to bring to this wedding but not important enough for me to commit to.\" Of course it sent mixed messages. Also, videos with like 4 likes and 16 comments show up on my FYP on tik tok all the time. It happens!!", "YTA, on the whole.\nMore to the point: you just broke up with her. if that\u2019s not what you meant to do, backpedal fast.\nI think it probably is what you meant to do, though.\nIt\u2019s about the intersection of things: you can ask someone to be your plus one at a wedding, making it clear that you are going as friends.\nBut if you are sleeping together, and spending all your free time together, and asking her to be your companion at an important social occasion \u2013 \u2013 that all adds up to more than casual. I\u2019m not an expert, but I would definitely say it amounts to a Situationship.\nSo she asked for clarification, and you gave it to her.\nThe reason I am saying why TA, is that while you do try to be honest, you blurred the line, and then reinforced it in an unnecessarily painful way. \nPersonally, I am rooting for the romcom ending, where you realize that Alicia is pretty special, and maybe you can work on this together. But obviously, it has to be what is right for you and if that\u2019s not it, apologize, and move on for both your sakes.", "FWB doesn't work. Someone always catches feelings, and someone always gets hurt. They seem good at the beginning, but thats it. \n\nShe caught the feelings. Now shes hurt. \n\nSounds like this is someone who you could see yourself with if you weren't so rigid in your own thinking. You do realize that you can still give your son a great life while setting him up with a sweet step mom, right? I was saddled with a great step parent when I turned 5, and he's been a better dad to me than my ACTUAL dad. \n\nJust sounds like you were doing all the relationship things, but are afraid of commitment, my dude. Leaving at 3AM is staying the night. You could be stopping yourself from a great thing. \n\nOpen your horizons, is my point. But no, NTA. You were clear in your expectations.", "Acting like a couple but denying the label of a couple will usually leave one or both people confused and hurt.", "What I would say is how do you feel about her? Is there a chance you may have feelings for her or potentially shutting her out emotionally because of your own timescale? You guys sound like you\u2019re good together now while that\u2019s something that you\u2019ve said you don\u2019t want, I would say don\u2019t completely close off to the idea", "YTA 6 or 7 years is way too long to be stringing a 27 year old woman along. Sure you were upfront but you still have to take responsibility for your actions not matching your words. What you describe you two doing is exclusive dating. It\u2019s not purely sex. So it\u2019s obvious feelings are going to get involved.", "NAH, but you have to accept that this could be the end of your relationship. If she is catching feelings and you're not interested, there's not much point in her continuing to see you.\n\nAlso, it's possible she thought YOU were catching feelings since you incited her to be your plus one at a wedding. To me, that's not something you do with a FWB, it's something you do with someone you're dating.", "NTA. But you have weird perceptions of parenthood. Having a small kid doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t date. You are in control of your partner\u2019s relationship with your kid, if that\u2019s what you are worried about. If it gets serious over time can asses whether to introduce the partner to your kid. To not do so would also be bit weird.", "YTA for not talking it out before, as a disinvite is kinda big. If you are friends, even without the benefits, it would deserve a discussion. You made an assumption and reacted rashly without reaching out to your friend. Seems like the friend part got lost in your knee jerk reaction to push her away.", "I don't know.  Going to the movies, dinner, gaming, those are all pretty relationship-py activities. So is inviting someone to a wedding.", "this is why \"FwB\" is such a stupid thing, either commit all the way to a relationship and sex or don't do anything at all and y'all can save yourself trouble", "Nta.  Time to move on.", "YTA - Because you have an exclusive relationship but insist very hard on not calling it one.\n\nThe hint that it's the case (even if you deny it very hard) - You are affected by her pulling away, you also have feelings involved, feelings strong enough to be hurt by it.\n\n> Did I tip the scales with the wedding invite? \n\nIndeed, that's not a FWB behavior at all. It might be the part where the scale was tipped, but you've been tipping the scale yourself very much by behaving as a boyfriend all this time.", "NAH. Sounds like you were honest about what you wanted from the beginning. She\u2019s not an asshole for catching feelings and hoping for more (though the way she communicated it was a bit childish for a 27 yo\u2026) I would leave her alone, she\u2019s probably disappointed but she\u2019ll get over it", "NTA. You dan stand your ground on your wants and boundaries. But Can I be completely honest? Putting your kid first is admirable. But what part of not giving him a potential mother you have great chemistry with is helping the child? And like.. doesn't uninviting her show that you maybe aren't as secure as you'd like and maybe want that too? Like.. it doesn't actually change anything if she wants to date you. You can keep doing your life in fwb mode and she can keep wanting something you won't give her. If anything it almost feels like an overreaction from you. Like especially if you're starting to consider them a close friend, the conversation of \"why do you feel that way\" or \"why did you send me that..?\" Would be better than uninviting. Lastly, if you just said \"we're seeing each other\" regardless of dating or fwb, it'd be true and convey what you are. I feel like you're sticking with the labels and missing the \"just let it flow\" part. I get wanting to put your kid first, but sacrificing yourself will not help your kid long term.", "If you already RSVPd you are being a major asshole. \n\nYou're gonna lose your \"really good pal\" over a TikTok video?  TikTok? Really.\n\nThat's actually kinda sad you'd be that insecure.", "YTA. You never invite an FWB to a wedding!  That\u2019s the definition of \u2018we\u2019re in an actual relationship so I\u2019m inviting you to a wedding.  The FWB thing rarely goes well for long - unless you keep it mostly sex.  Once you start hanging out a lot, it gets VERY muddy!!", "YTA you should have talked to her BEFORE uninviting her", "I think your assumption is wrong. I get so much random shit in my feed. And yta for ghosting her. Talk ti her. \n\nIf she is catching feelings then break it off but don't just ghost her.\n\nBut words of advice. Sleeping over doesn't make it too relationshippy.

You showed too much interest and it sparked feelings.  You were wrong.", "Dude, the tik tok algorithm is nuts, so I would never assume she was searching something out based on 1 video. And I've had videos from small accounts on my \"for you\" all the time. \n\nI think I'm going YTA for this reason: you told her you don't want to go with her anymore, she (apparently) accepted that and moved on, but you continue to text, wanting to explain more about why you don't want to take her is what tips the scales for me.

He will not be harmed by meeting a few new people as you date and look for the right person.", "NAH. As usually happens, the lines got blurry (wedding invite) and feelings grew unexpectedly.  Nobody is at fault, because these things are pretty impossible to navigate. \n\nOne takeaway though: you sure you're actually staying single to focus on your son for the next 7 years?

Friends game together, go to movies, etc etc. FWBs don\u2019t have to be booty calls only.", "Sure, but they definitely don't spend all their free time together either.", "Neither do they. OP spends time with her when he\u2019s childless, but i\u2019m sure OP has other free time when his kid\u2019s around. And I\u2019m sure she has a lot more free time she isn\u2019t spending with him. \n\nIt definitely sounds like they\u2019re quite close and I obviously get how feelings could be caught, but I don\u2019t think that makes him confused. It seems normal to me to enjoy a very close friendship with someone that involves sex but not want a relationship."]}
