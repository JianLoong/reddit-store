We both worked from home and our son was very colicky, i was exclusively breastfeeding and was up every night with him, doing all bed time feedings, nails clippings, teeth brushing, he did baths and diapers. It seemed like a fair arrangement. Eventually Covid ended and we got a nanny for Saturdays and our son started daycare he goes from 9-5, my husband started leaving for the day for work. I asked him to change the diapers when he was at home because our son who is in the 100th+ percentile in height and weight was hard to manage for me, i got by on days when i was alone but it was definitely difficult. Even when my mom would visit she would have hard time with the diaper changing and she works at a childcare facility because he was big and unruly. Now our son is 3 and almost fully potty trained, he wears a diaper over night. So we put a diaper on at night and take it off in the morning, and I\u2019m pregnant again with really bad nausea so I\u2019ve asked him to get the baby ready in the mornings as I\u2019m usually choking back the vomit. My husband has decided he will not change any of the future babies diapers and has become very resentful saying that it was totally abusive and abnormal for him to change so many diapers through our sons life and that other dads don\u2019t have to change so many diapers. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve changed zero diapers, i changed diapers any time he wasn\u2019t home. On sick days i am always the one who stays at home with him and cares for him completely. I always felt like our parenting duties were pretty evenly divided until i got pregnant 3 months ago and things have definitely been harder since then because it\u2019s hard for me some days to do the things i used to do like make breakfast, get his daycare bag ready,physically pick him up. Am i the asshole for letting him/ expecting him to change so many diapers?", "created_utc": 1691790666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15olvi7/aita_my_husband_has_changed_all_of_the_babies/", "score": 3480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wife is off work for a year to raise the child, which means EVERYTHING when I\u2019m at work. The least I can do is change every diaper when I\u2019m home. Even if I\u2019m tired after a long day\u2019s work, because my wife\u2019s work right now is 24/7. She lets me sleep through the night so I can be rested for work.

Your husband is a major one for complaining about one of his few responsibilities to his children.  \n  \nI'm going to say this and some people are going to bitch at me but I don't care.  \n  \nDads who don't change diapers aren't dads.   \n  \nYour husband is at a similar state as I was while my wife was caring for our first and pregnant with our second where I felt that because I was working that I shouldn't have to do things when I came home.  \n  \nYour husband is your child's father and he needs to come to grips with the fact that there is no such thing as 50/50 division of labor in all aspects especially since you and he might not be equally suited to certain tasks and that will only increase as your kids get older.   \n  \nSo what if he changes all the diapers? You did all the breastfeeding. And if he really did zero of the night time care and left you to do it he's a major major asshole.", "NTA \nIt sounds like you divided responsibilities.

The arrangement here was literally suggested to my husband by our midwife so he felt involved and needed. I don\u2019t change diapers, my husband is happy to take that off my plate. Your husband saying he refuses to change any diapers for the new baby, that seems extreme to me, and I\u2019m missing any indication from you that you are insisting he be the sole changer of the new baby. \n\nHe needs to communicate his needs better and not be taking the word of less involved fathers that he\u2019s being taken advantage of.

There is a lot more that goes into it than that!

If I\u2019m reading you correctly, you agreed upon a division of labour with the first child, and your husband has been a good dad and you\u2019ve both stuck to the agreement. It sounds like he may want to renegotiate the division of labour with the second child on the way and that\u2019s fair.

Why a diaper? \n\nNot trying to be snarky or anything but why isn\u2019t the 3yr old already potty trained? \n\nThis is something I\u2019ve been seeing the last few years. Kids not being potty trained by at least 1.5-2 years of age. Have had parents come in my office & complain about diaper prices for 4 & 5 yr olds & daycare or pre-k won\u2019t take them bc they\u2019re still in diapers.

I didn\u2019t say anything bc she gets upset easy. She asked how I trained my son so young. \n\nI told her that he watched us use the toilet & he wanted to do the same.

We dont look at things as 50/50, but just do what needs to be done.\n\nThe best tip for bigger kids who squirm a lot is sitting on the floor and putting the toddler between your legs and then placing your legs on top of his arms so he can't roll over. Take the diaper off, give him a wipe. Lift his legs, slap a new one under his bum quickly, and fasten it.

Diaper changes can be gross, and OP admits that he did more than his fair share of them.

I know that taking care of children is hard work, I would never say that it isn\u2019t. However, there seems to me that there is this expectation that dad takes over for mom directly after they get home from work to give mom a break, and if not, they are contributing to the patriarchy.

There isn't any proof he would have to change all the diapers this time around. It's a shitty situation for everyone the first time around but you should be able to communicate and validate each other as equals and come up with a new plan that makes everyone happy.

He was the best husband you could ever ask for when I was pregnant and breastfeeding.  If I could have stayed pregnant and breastfeeding forever the marriage would have been a breeze.  He also was very proud of picking up any female thing; like period cups, I needed. It's a great way to meet chicks To be honest. He had a pretty awesome dad who was his world and the kind nurturing parent in his family. After his dad passed when we were 21 he took his advice from his mum, who he swore he full on hated.

OP described in fairly close detail a situation where she *physically couldn't* or it was harder/more dangerous for her to do something that her husband could easily do, AND (in my opinion) she more than compensated in the overall childcare workload.

I can understand his frustration given the past three years, it\u2019s not a pleasant feeling when anyone abdicates certain responsibilities because they would rather designate things, then suck it up and do it for the betterment of the family and the child.\n\nI can\u2019t get over the fact that the diaper changes are so unequal .. how is that possible. When my wife and I did this with our two boys, it was damn near 50-50, we never kept track, and we always did it with whoever was available and it was completely unspoken.. we did it because it needed done.\n\nAnd I still can\u2019t get over the fact about her saying she was unable to change a two year olds diaper .. I find that very hard to believe even when the child as large.. every parent figures out a way to distract their child to get something done.. that doesn\u2019t change because of the child\u2019s size", "Congrats.

It's an easy solution.", "Hormones are drugs. But that\u2019s not exactly true, one of the most commonly used drugs to get this outcome in males is by taking motilium, which is not a hormone but just a drug that was made for nausea/vomiting and gastroparesis but had such severe side effects that it is rarely used for those reasons, and an increase in prolactin is one of those side effects.

He was the one who refused to keep diapers on so we had to put them on backwards. He was our roly poly during diaper changes. I am ever so thankful that his lack of liking diapers is what helped us getting him potty trained. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTDLR; long winded way of saying that every child, even in the same household is completely different. Heck my friends brother never spoke at home until he was 5 because he figured out he didn't have to talk to get his needs met.", "So - you are actually supposed to break the seams. That\u2019s the design for taking them off. Our changes became a lot easier when we found that out. It\u2019s not as difficult to rip them when you do it with the confidence of knowing it\u2019s what they were designed for. Can\u2019t explain why - probably magic.", "Sounds perfect - can they split breastfeeding?", "Motilium is banned in the U.S., because of those severe side effects. Idk where OP is, but this method might not be an option for them, even if her husband was willing to consider it.\n\nIt can be possible to induce milk production by stimulation alone, even in cis men (though that is less common than in cis women, and often you won't get nearly enough to actually feed a child exclusively this way). Typically people will use a breast pump every couple hours for a period of time for this stimulation.", "> Yeah I\u2019m confused about changing the three year old, maybe it\u2019s a different situation but I babysat a three year old in pull ups and he was able to help I didn\u2019t have to pick him up to do it\n\nI truly didn\u2019t mean to come down on you like a ton of bricks. Thank you for being open to feedback. Here\u2019s what I got\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confused because I had a different experience with a different child of a similar age.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that if the child in OP\u2019s post were able to cooperate with a pull-up change, he would. It\u2019s possible that the parents never tried standing up changes\u2026 but incredibly unlikely. Some kids are big and strong and fast and unable to cooperate. \n\nSaying you\u2019re confused because you had a different experience suggests (to me) that you think that there is something not valid about OP\u2019s experience, that OP must be doing it wrong. It\u2019s not confusing. It\u2019s just different\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that parenting is hard and that (barring abuse) we might do better to trust that the parent and child are doing their absolute best in their particular social/economic and developmental/neurological circumstances."]}
