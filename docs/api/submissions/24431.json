We both worked from home and our son was very colicky, i was exclusively breastfeeding and was up every night with him, doing all bed time feedings, nails clippings, teeth brushing, he did baths and diapers. It seemed like a fair arrangement. Eventually Covid ended and we got a nanny for Saturdays and our son started daycare he goes from 9-5, my husband started leaving for the day for work. I asked him to change the diapers when he was at home because our son who is in the 100th+ percentile in height and weight was hard to manage for me, i got by on days when i was alone but it was definitely difficult. Even when my mom would visit she would have hard time with the diaper changing and she works at a childcare facility because he was big and unruly. Now our son is 3 and almost fully potty trained, he wears a diaper over night. So we put a diaper on at night and take it off in the morning, and I\u2019m pregnant again with really bad nausea so I\u2019ve asked him to get the baby ready in the mornings as I\u2019m usually choking back the vomit. My husband has decided he will not change any of the future babies diapers and has become very resentful saying that it was totally abusive and abnormal for him to change so many diapers through our sons life and that other dads don\u2019t have to change so many diapers. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve changed zero diapers, i changed diapers any time he wasn\u2019t home. On sick days i am always the one who stays at home with him and cares for him completely. I always felt like our parenting duties were pretty evenly divided until i got pregnant 3 months ago and things have definitely been harder since then because it\u2019s hard for me some days to do the things i used to do like make breakfast, get his daycare bag ready,physically pick him up. Am i the asshole for letting him/ expecting him to change so many diapers?", "created_utc": 1691790666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15olvi7/aita_my_husband_has_changed_all_of_the_babies/", "score": 5958, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wife is off work for a year to raise the child, which means EVERYTHING when I\u2019m at work. The least I can do is change every diaper when I\u2019m home. Even if I\u2019m tired after a long day\u2019s work, because my wife\u2019s work right now is 24/7. She lets me sleep through the night so I can be rested for work.

Your husband is a major one for complaining about one of his few responsibilities to his children.  \n  \nI'm going to say this and some people are going to bitch at me but I don't care.  \n  \nDads who don't change diapers aren't dads.   \n  \nYour husband is at a similar state as I was while my wife was caring for our first and pregnant with our second where I felt that because I was working that I shouldn't have to do things when I came home.  \n  \nYour husband is your child's father and he needs to come to grips with the fact that there is no such thing as 50/50 division of labor in all aspects especially since you and he might not be equally suited to certain tasks and that will only increase as your kids get older.   \n  \nSo what if he changes all the diapers? You did all the breastfeeding. And if he really did zero of the night time care and left you to do it he's a major major asshole.", "NTA \nIt sounds like you divided responsibilities.

The arrangement here was literally suggested to my husband by our midwife so he felt involved and needed. I don\u2019t change diapers, my husband is happy to take that off my plate. Your husband saying he refuses to change any diapers for the new baby, that seems extreme to me, and I\u2019m missing any indication from you that you are insisting he be the sole changer of the new baby. \n\nHe needs to communicate his needs better and not be taking the word of less involved fathers that he\u2019s being taken advantage of. My husband would never say that, and he\u2019s changed twice as many diapers as your husband has. NTA.", "I don\u2019t get what the problem is with your husband changing the nappies.

There is a lot more that goes into it than that!

My guess is most of the YTA are men or folks who\u2019ve never  bern pregnant, given birth or exclusively breastfed.\n\nMy husband participated in all aspects of parenting and relished the time he had with his babies through whatever activities he was doing.\n\nYour husband seems to care too much what other people do.

It\u2019s not rocket science, it\u2019s communication and compromise.", "NAH. If I\u2019m reading you correctly, you agreed upon a division of labour with the first child, and your husband has been a good dad and you\u2019ve both stuck to the agreement. It sounds like he may want to renegotiate the division of labour with the second child on the way and that\u2019s fair.

Why a diaper? \n\nNot trying to be snarky or anything but why isn\u2019t the 3yr old already potty trained? \n\nThis is something I\u2019ve been seeing the last few years. Kids not being potty trained by at least 1.5-2 years of age. Have had parents come in my office & complain about diaper prices for 4 & 5 yr olds & daycare or pre-k won\u2019t take them bc they\u2019re still in diapers. They stated it\u2019s the daycare\u2019s job to potty train the children. Wtf? \n\nMy stepdaughter is complaining that she can\u2019t get her 4 yr old into pre-k bc she\u2019s not trained. I didn\u2019t say anything bc she gets upset easy. She asked how I trained my son so young. \n\nI told her that he watched us use the toilet & he wanted to do the same.

If a diaper needs changing, just do it, either of you. We have 3 kids. We dont look at things as 50/50, but just do what needs to be done.\n\nThe best tip for bigger kids who squirm a lot is sitting on the floor and putting the toddler between your legs and then placing your legs on top of his arms so he can't roll over. Take the diaper off, give him a wipe. Lift his legs, slap a new one under his bum quickly, and fasten it.

Diaper changes can be gross, and OP admits that he did more than his fair share of them.

I know that taking care of children is hard work, I would never say that it isn\u2019t. However, there seems to me that there is this expectation that dad takes over for mom directly after they get home from work to give mom a break, and if not, they are contributing to the patriarchy.

However he's likely going to need to take care of their son including his diapers so she can take care of the newborn. He shouldn't be changing 90% of the diapers this time around anyways but he can't expect that he will change zero. He should expect that he makes sure his son is taken care of everyday when he gets home and can't check out until after his son does to bed. It sucks but it's part of being a dad.

There isn't any proof he would have to change all the diapers this time around. It's a shitty situation for everyone the first time around but you should be able to communicate and validate each other as equals and come up with a new plan that makes everyone happy.
