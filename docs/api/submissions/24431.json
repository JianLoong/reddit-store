We both worked from home and our son was very colicky, i was exclusively breastfeeding and was up every night with him, doing all bed time feedings, nails clippings, teeth brushing, he did baths and diapers. It seemed like a fair arrangement. Eventually Covid ended and we got a nanny for Saturdays and our son started daycare he goes from 9-5, my husband started leaving for the day for work. I asked him to change the diapers when he was at home because our son who is in the 100th+ percentile in height and weight was hard to manage for me, i got by on days when i was alone but it was definitely difficult. Even when my mom would visit she would have hard time with the diaper changing and she works at a childcare facility because he was big and unruly. Now our son is 3 and almost fully potty trained, he wears a diaper over night. So we put a diaper on at night and take it off in the morning, and I\u2019m pregnant again with really bad nausea so I\u2019ve asked him to get the baby ready in the mornings as I\u2019m usually choking back the vomit. My husband has decided he will not change any of the future babies diapers and has become very resentful saying that it was totally abusive and abnormal for him to change so many diapers through our sons life and that other dads don\u2019t have to change so many diapers. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve changed zero diapers, i changed diapers any time he wasn\u2019t home. On sick days i am always the one who stays at home with him and cares for him completely. I always felt like our parenting duties were pretty evenly divided until i got pregnant 3 months ago and things have definitely been harder since then because it\u2019s hard for me some days to do the things i used to do like make breakfast, get his daycare bag ready,physically pick him up.

Wife is off work for a year to raise the child, which means EVERYTHING when I\u2019m at work. The least I can do is change every diaper when I\u2019m home. Even if I\u2019m tired after a long day\u2019s work, because my wife\u2019s work right now is 24/7. She lets me sleep through the night so I can be rested for work.

Your husband is a major one for complaining about one of his few responsibilities to his children.  \n  \nI'm going to say this and some people are going to bitch at me but I don't care.  \n  \nDads who don't change diapers aren't dads.   \n  \nYour husband is at a similar state as I was while my wife was caring for our first and pregnant with our second where I felt that because I was working that I shouldn't have to do things when I came home.  \n  \nYour husband is your child's father and he needs to come to grips with the fact that there is no such thing as 50/50 division of labor in all aspects especially since you and he might not be equally suited to certain tasks and that will only increase as your kids get older.   \n  \nSo what if he changes all the diapers? You did all the breastfeeding. And if he really did zero of the night time care and left you to do it he's a major major asshole.", "NTA \nIt sounds like you divided responsibilities.

The arrangement here was literally suggested to my husband by our midwife so he felt involved and needed. I don\u2019t change diapers, my husband is happy to take that off my plate. Your husband saying he refuses to change any diapers for the new baby, that seems extreme to me, and I\u2019m missing any indication from you that you are insisting he be the sole changer of the new baby. \n\nHe needs to communicate his needs better and not be taking the word of less involved fathers that he\u2019s being taken advantage of.

If I\u2019m reading you correctly, you agreed upon a division of labour with the first child, and your husband has been a good dad and you\u2019ve both stuck to the agreement.

I didn\u2019t say anything bc she gets upset easy. She asked how I trained my son so young. \n\nI told her that he watched us use the toilet & he wanted to do the same.

We dont look at things as 50/50, but just do what needs to be done.\n\nThe best tip for bigger kids who squirm a lot is sitting on the floor and putting the toddler between your legs and then placing your legs on top of his arms so he can't roll over. Take the diaper off, give him a wipe. Lift his legs, slap a new one under his bum quickly, and fasten it.

Maybe she can change more diaper sure, but then maybe he should be picking up other responsibilities.  Your comment is so laughably naive and condescending.", "Or you know it's exaggeration and you're just stupid", "COVID-19 pandemic has officially been announced to have ended. It's treated the same way a cold is now.", "Maybe cuz she did everything else including gestating the baby for 9 months?

You're talking about a hypothetical man who was letting his wife change all the diapers and also wasn't doing anything else to help either. This is a woman who's letting her husband change most of the diapers _while she's breastfeeding_.\n\nMy wife and I have a 17 day old baby. Many, many times she's handed me the baby to change and then I've handed her straight back so she can carry on feeding. Pretty sure I've got the better end of that bargain.", "I wonder if it\u2019s because he finally done with diaper changes and here comes the next baby. \n\nI would suggest pull ups when your baby doesn\u2019t want to lay there for diaper changes.

She mentioned she woke up every night and exclusively breastfed, so she did 100% of the night shifts and 100% of the feeding. \n\nI agree with you in general that it shouldn't somewhat equal out to 50/50, but sometimes it's going to be 80/20 and other times 30/70.

But maybe your pediatrician was being fast and loose with the terminology to try to show how unusual your child's growth was? \n\nAnyway, it's a weird thought to have a child that big, as a short person (not quite as short as you, but close), whose youngest child for a while was measuring below the lowest line on the growth chart for height. (Around 3rd percentile) Her pediatrician said, \"Well, we don't really care which line they are on, but we like them to be on *a* line....\" and short me cringed about passing on my short genes, lol. (Eventually she said it was fine because her growth over time was staying on a line with itself, i.e. she was staying in around the 3rd percentile, so probably just really small, not failure to thrive or anything.)", "Ok so by that logic your child should be pretty average size. They don't just pick a parent and take their height lol. \n\nLook at baby future height calculators. If your husband is 7' and you are 4'10, your son is going to be about 6'1\".

They will have various curves showing your baby's growth at one age and the anticipated height/weight at another age- if the baby is significant outside of what would be expected for their age they will say they're above the 100th percentile. It doesn't make sense from  a math perspective but parents know what it means.", "It is not how percentiles work, but I absolutely is how paediatricians talk about growth scales though. I\u2019ve had larger babies, and know many people with smaller and larger babies all of whom have been told their children are off the growth scales.

So how is it not fair that he does 100% of something? Not to mention changing a diaper takes  less than 5 minutes, whereas each feeding session is 30-45 minutes, also multiple times a day. \n\nBabies generally feed 8-10x a day and then some go through growth spurts where you're doing multiple feeds in a row, so you can finish a 45 min feed and then baby wants to feed again, so you're just sitting there for HOURS while your baby is feeding from you the whole time.", "Pampers 360 even has a piece of tape on the butt to close it up afterwards", "Ughh I'm so sorry OP.
