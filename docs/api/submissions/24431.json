We both worked from home and our son was very colicky, i was exclusively breastfeeding and was up every night with him, doing all bed time feedings, nails clippings, teeth brushing, he did baths and diapers. It seemed like a fair arrangement. Eventually Covid ended and we got a nanny for Saturdays and our son started daycare he goes from 9-5, my husband started leaving for the day for work. I asked him to change the diapers when he was at home because our son who is in the 100th+ percentile in height and weight was hard to manage for me, i got by on days when i was alone but it was definitely difficult. Even when my mom would visit she would have hard time with the diaper changing and she works at a childcare facility because he was big and unruly. Now our son is 3 and almost fully potty trained, he wears a diaper over night. So we put a diaper on at night and take it off in the morning, and I\u2019m pregnant again with really bad nausea so I\u2019ve asked him to get the baby ready in the mornings as I\u2019m usually choking back the vomit. My husband has decided he will not change any of the future babies diapers and has become very resentful saying that it was totally abusive and abnormal for him to change so many diapers through our sons life and that other dads don\u2019t have to change so many diapers. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve changed zero diapers, i changed diapers any time he wasn\u2019t home. On sick days i am always the one who stays at home with him and cares for him completely. I always felt like our parenting duties were pretty evenly divided until i got pregnant 3 months ago and things have definitely been harder since then because it\u2019s hard for me some days to do the things i used to do like make breakfast, get his daycare bag ready,physically pick him up. Am i the asshole for letting him/ expecting him to change so many diapers?", "created_utc": 1691790666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15olvi7/aita_my_husband_has_changed_all_of_the_babies/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wife is off work for a year to raise the child, which means EVERYTHING when I\u2019m at work. The least I can do is change every diaper when I\u2019m home. Even if I\u2019m tired after a long day\u2019s work, because my wife\u2019s work right now is 24/7. She lets me sleep through the night so I can be rested for work.

Your husband is a major one for complaining about one of his few responsibilities to his children.  \n  \nI'm going to say this and some people are going to bitch at me but I don't care.  \n  \nDads who don't change diapers aren't dads.   \n  \nYour husband is at a similar state as I was while my wife was caring for our first and pregnant with our second where I felt that because I was working that I shouldn't have to do things when I came home.  \n  \nYour husband is your child's father and he needs to come to grips with the fact that there is no such thing as 50/50 division of labor in all aspects especially since you and he might not be equally suited to certain tasks and that will only increase as your kids get older.   \n  \nSo what if he changes all the diapers? You did all the breastfeeding. And if he really did zero of the night time care and left you to do it he's a major major asshole.", "NTA \nIt sounds like you divided responsibilities.

The arrangement here was literally suggested to my husband by our midwife so he felt involved and needed. I don\u2019t change diapers, my husband is happy to take that off my plate. Your husband saying he refuses to change any diapers for the new baby, that seems extreme to me, and I\u2019m missing any indication from you that you are insisting he be the sole changer of the new baby. \n\nHe needs to communicate his needs better and not be taking the word of less involved fathers that he\u2019s being taken advantage of.

If I\u2019m reading you correctly, you agreed upon a division of labour with the first child, and your husband has been a good dad and you\u2019ve both stuck to the agreement.

I didn\u2019t say anything bc she gets upset easy. She asked how I trained my son so young. \n\nI told her that he watched us use the toilet & he wanted to do the same.

We dont look at things as 50/50, but just do what needs to be done.\n\nThe best tip for bigger kids who squirm a lot is sitting on the floor and putting the toddler between your legs and then placing your legs on top of his arms so he can't roll over. Take the diaper off, give him a wipe. Lift his legs, slap a new one under his bum quickly, and fasten it.

Diaper changes can be gross, and OP admits that he did more than his fair share of them.

I know that taking care of children is hard work, I would never say that it isn\u2019t. However, there seems to me that there is this expectation that dad takes over for mom directly after they get home from work to give mom a break, and if not, they are contributing to the patriarchy.

However he's likely going to need to take care of their son including his diapers so she can take care of the newborn. He shouldn't be changing 90% of the diapers this time around anyways but he can't expect that he will change zero. He should expect that he makes sure his son is taken care of everyday when he gets home and can't check out until after his son does to bed. It sucks but it's part of being a dad.

Come back when you\u2019re wetting your own pants because your pelvic floor is weak and your nipples point to the floor from breastfeeding. \n\nIt\u2019s never going to be equal or the same or whatever.

Grow up.", "Lol ok troll", "Both sleeping, just passing the time lol", "It may not be the worlds toughest job. But it\u2019s absolutely tougher than my day job, more stressful, and more difficult on the body. I\u2019ll take the burden when I\u2019m home, every time. \n\nStaying home with a child isn\u2019t inherently difficult, but these mothers aren\u2019t sitting on the couch with the baby in a crib doing sudoku and crosswords. They\u2019re managing the house. Groceries, laundry, general housekeeping. In some cases other kids or pets. An at-home parent is absolutely a job.", "So should he just ignore his child and do zero childcare when he gets home from work?", "Your 13 year old has changed hundreds of diapers for 2 years?", "The post says she works from home. That is not at all the same as not having a job.  Plenty of people work 40 hour weeks or more from home.", "I'm a full time working mom, and I expect to take care of the kids as soon as I get home. I don't know why a parent wouldn't expect that. Obviously I don't change diapers during my work day, and we don't count the diapers evenings and weekends, but it should be roughly 50/50 when we're both home. OP has physical difficulties changing their kid's diapers, so it makes sense that her husband should change most diapers when he's at home. \n\nHonestly it's frustrating how working dads were expected to get a break but working moms are still expected to do everything. My spouse is a stay at home dad and I pack lunches and make the doctors appointments and make the fun weekend plans and basically anything I can do for the kids. My break on weekdays happen after the kids go to bed, and on weekends sometimes I can schedule something sometimes I can't. It's all part of being a parent though. Or, I guess a mom at least.\n\nEdit to add: also OP posts that she works from home, that's why they have daycare/nanny.", "They said they were both working from home during COVID so it sounds like OP does have a job as well, though I'm not sure as they never mentioned it again but giving them the benefit of the doubt they are working as well.", "No job and she has a nanny if you look at her post. Plus her hubby did most of the diapers. I don\u2019t think he should have zero diaper changing duties but I can see why he might be upset and want to change less for baby #2. She does have some help.  EDit: I was wrong she works from home. So maybe something else is wrong here. He should help more since she was nursing.", "Can\u2019t imagine how poorly he\u2019d handle pregnancy and childbirth if that were the reality", "Working and paying for shit doesnt take away any parental responsibilities that you\u2019re supposed to do, for men or women.", "That's exactly what she has done since the beginning.

Congrats on the new edition!!!  I hope mom,baby and you are recovering well.\n\nThat makes more sense.  I'm in agreement with you that it should be a shared responsibility.  Most are easy changes, but we've all had that blowout in an airplane at 30000 feet with the FA frantically telling you the seatbeal sign is on.  It's not easy or fun at all.\n\nMy point is both parties wants the other to do all the changes and according to both of us is unfair.", "But\u2026 she did more than brush the baby\u2019s teeth.  She grew the baby and gave birth to it and then breastfed it.", "I agree, it is unfair if you are the working spouse, you should not be expected to do everything. From the looks of Reddit, working dads are rarely given the benefit of the doubt, much less led to believe that they should ever expect a break. In fact, the internet has gone out of its way countless times to shame and put down fathers for not doing enough. I agree, when you are both home, 50/50 would make the most sense. I was more so speaking in the sense that the working parent is expected the take a vast majority of the childcare once they get home from work. I find that to be incredibly unfair. I\u2019m sorry if my post made it seem as though OP\u2019s husband should be able to kick his feet up when he got home, which is not what I meant. I meant that over the course of the day, if childcare responsibilities are split 50/50 between the stay at home and working parent, that would be incredibly unfair. Additionally, it sounds as if their son only wears diapers at night. Can\u2019t she take them off in the morning if her husband puts them on at night?", "Sounds like a husband issue.  If he's stay at home you shouldn't be doing any of that.", "Seriously! I am not a parent myself but like, isn\u2019t actively parenting your kids when you\u2019re around them kind of the point of having them? Idk!", "She does have a job, she says she works from home.

I think I mentioned in mine that she had a nanny on saturdays and her son goes to daycare on the weekdays. My point is that I think childcare should not be equal, but equitable. If the dad\u2019s working full-time for the family, I don\u2019t think he should be expected to have an equal amount of responsibilities to the child as the stay at home parent. People seem to miss that working partners are providing for the child, just not in the conventional sense. They are securing a stable environment and a consistent supply of food for a growing baby. I also don\u2019t believe that OP\u2019s husband means that he will never change another diaper, I think he was using an extremism to illustrate how frustrated he is with the arrangement.", "Guess we\u2019ll never know as it is a biological impossibility to find out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I was replying to someone who thought they were being coy by suggesting they swap the roles, stupid.

I mean, who hasn\u2019t\u2026\n\nWe both were on the same page from the start. Neither of us wants to do them all. Neither of us expects the other to do them all.

Thanks. I see where I thought she said does not work. I do think he should share the task. There is daycare and a nanny.", "OP is also working, just works from home. And if there\u2019s a sole provider dynamic, the work of actually staying home and raising children is just as valid a contribution as financial support, which leads to the point that parents should operate as a team rather than contributing to the disregard of physical and emotional and mental labor that so often falls to the SAHP", "Why do you keep talking about families with stay at home parents? How does that relate to this post where both parents work full time?", "They both work, so essentially when the child comes home, they are on equal time. No one sat around all day eating bonbons. It\u2019s also unacceptable to say you\u2019re just going to stop providing an aspect of your child\u2019s care because you just don\u2019t feel like it. She said the child is almost fully potty trained, so it\u2019s like one diaper per day that he has to change. And the most important part of all of this is that she\u2019s currently pregnant, which actually means that she\u2019s working far more than him since creating a child inside of you is literal 24/7 work. Not only is she obviously feeling sick and fatigued, she should not be lifting heavy objects - like a 100+ percentile toddler. So even if he never wants to change a diaper again, he really doesn\u2019t have a choice for the next several months until she gives birth for the safety of his wife and child. And don\u2019t have another kid if you\u2019re not willing to put in the work. And it\u2019s 2023 - being a high-maintenance, unwilling participant of a father is not cool anymore. His friends sound so stupid.", "Then what would be the problem with them swapping ? I dont get why you thought that was an \u201caha!\u201d Moment with the \u201cwell if she wants to work and pay for everything\u201d as if that would be a problem, only thing is her husband doesnt even wanna change his own kids diapers so clearly he wouldnt be able to handle that.", "Yes its to tape the diaper close afterwards.

If I had the choice of changing all the diapers or doing EVERYTHING else, I would choose diapers every time. Diapers are the easy part of the parenting thing, even when there is a blowout. You know what is not easy? Getting up every few hours to soothe a crying baby for extended periods of time. Then having to be functional and present for your child the following day when you literally are more tired than you\u2019ve ever been.
