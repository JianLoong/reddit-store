Contact your landlord. I live in a nearby state. And yes, you must keep the heat on in the winter or the pipes can freeze. I would imagine that keeping the heat on would be in your contract. I have a 2 floor house. The second floor barely gets any use. But we still keep it heated to 68. The downstairs is kept to 70. You don't need to keep it that warm (although less than that is uncomfortable for most people). But I wouldn't set it much below 65. Your roommate is a jerk and I would try to get him out of there. Most places are not going to put up with what he is trying to pull. If he doesn't like it, he can buy his own home or move way down south where having the heat on isn't a must.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

An agreement is an agreement, so he should still pay half-half, but I can understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to pay if he doesn\u2019t like the heat being on.

Your roommate clearly doesn't understand either thermodynamics or shared housing.  Even if he chooses to keep his room cooler, the heaters in the rest of the apartment are providing some heat to his room. And presumably he uses the kitchen and bathroom, whether or not he uses the living room, so he should be paying his share of heating those.  \n\nAlso, check your lease.  It probably requires you to keep the apartment at some minimum temperature in winter.  \n\nIf it is 60 degrees Fahrenheit in his room and colder than that outdoors, then the heaters in the apartment (as well as the ones above, below, and to each side, to a lesser extent) are contributing to heating his room to 60 degrees.  \n\nI don't think you should let this situation go on any longer. I also think that you should be vigilant to ensure that he doesn't turn the heaters off/down in the rest of the apartment.  \n\nIf he is willing to pay half and keep living there, the two of you could look into whether there's anything you can do to improve the insulation that would be cost-effective.  For example, weather-stripping on windows, installing insulating layers on any electrical sockets on an outside wall, and shrink-wrapping at least some of the windows.", "How high you cranking the heat?

What does the lease say regarding utilities?
