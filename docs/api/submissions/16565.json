But not everyone.\n\nWell yesterday in French class (which is all girls but has both juniors and seniors) we were talking about prom. Everyone was talking about what our dresses looked like. So I said that my dress is floor-length and blue. Well this other girl, Skylar spoke up right after me. She's also a junior and her boyfriend is a senior, and we were kind of friends in elementary school but she moved away for junior high and then moved back and is kind of a snob.\n\nSo Skylar said that she bought a short black dress because it's not her prom. So I asked what she meant. She said that since she's a junior she shouldn't be dressed as formal as the seniors because the event isn't for her. I told her that's not a real rule, and she said she can't control what I do but she thinks I'm being rude and taking attention away from the seniors (because my dress is long and not a neutral color).\n\nThis other girl in class, Rosie, who is a senior, said she doesn't care what anyone wears as long as they're dressed nice. Skylar said she doesn't speak for her whole class. \n\nSo now I'm nervous about the dress I bought and I wonder WIBTA for wearing a long dress even though it's not my prom?", "created_utc": 1683399031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139yldu/wibta_for_wearing_a_long_dress_to_prom/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Enjoy prom.", "Don't let your \"mean girl\" classmate make you feel self-concious.  Some seniors' dates may be from other schools, some could even be graduated already.  Has Skylar made up imaginary rules for those situations as well?  Forget her nonsense and enjoy the prom!", "Your dress sounds lovely and I hope you enjoy prom. Skyler's comments are ridiculous. You may find she is just trying to justify wearing a little black dress.", "NTA - This isn\u2019t a wedding where you have to not wear the bride\u2019s color. This is a prom. No one really cares if anyone\u2019s dresses will be floor length or knee length, or what color everyone is wearing. Your friend has an irrational fear and she\u2019s trying to pass it off to you. This is not a rule and nothing to worry over.", "NTA - I've never heard of taking the attention off of others at prom. Don't feel nervous, wear what makes you happy and enjoy your night!", "Mean girls gonna mean girl. Do you boo!", "Def NTA literally never heard of a rule like that in my life", "NTA! Skylar is not the gatekeeper of prom dresses. You found a dress you like. Enjoy your night at the prom!", "NTA\n\nProms are formal, your dress sounds perfectly appropriate. I\u2019ve never heard your friend\u2019s \u201crule\u201d.", "You\u2019re friend is an idiot and you can laugh when she feels put of place (and underdressed) wearing a short black dress to a prom.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Skyler is being stupid.", "NTA it\u2019s prom! I only got to go to my Junior prom, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to treat it like it\u2019s your prom as well. It is. You\u2019re going!

Typical catty girl who likes to piss in everyone\u2019s cornflakes. I would brush it off, dress up nice and have a great time. She should put her claws away and know that her particular shade of green isn\u2019t attractive.", "YWNBTA, ignore Skylar. Dress how you like.", "NTA  I think she's just trying to mess with you.  I was invited to 4 proms that weren't mine and I wore a floor length dress every time!!\n\nWear what's comfortable and ignore your classmate.", "NTA- there is no such rule. We did have junior and senior proms at my school, and both were a mixed bag of long or short dresses. I can't even tell you what grade anyone was in and what they wore.", "NTA\nYou are fine. I have never heard that someone's prom date should dress differently than if they were a senior or from that school. No 0rom photis I have ever seen have only senior girls in long formal dresses. \n\n Skylar is making up a rule. Maybe she is defending her short dress choice in advance before anyone questions it by acting like she thought it was proper. Skylar seems insecure.", "NTA most people dont care. its prom people want to have fun no one is going to start a fight over you in a floor length blue dress ( and if they do they are going to look like an ass )", "NTA. Wear the floor length dress. Look amazing. Let her be jealous or whatever. There is no rule saying you can't go all out if you are an underclassman. Prom is prom. Tomorrow isn't promised. What if you don't go to your senior prom for some reason? \n\nIf anything, she is going to look out of place wearing a short dress while everyone else is wearing long ones.", ">This other girl in class, Rosie, who is a senior, said she doesn't care what anyone wears as long as they're dressed nice. Skylar said she doesn't speak for her whole class. \n\nSkylar doesn't speak for the whole class either, especially since she's not a senior. Go with Rosie's opinion, wear your lovely long dress, and avoid the mean girls.\n\nYWNBTA.", "NTA. The only reason I could come up with to not wear a floor length dress is if the prom were outside on a grassy meadow or something and you wouldn't want it to get grass stains. \n\n\nOr maybe if you wear a thick fabric and it's sweltering hot outside.\n\n\n\nOtherwise just wear what you want and enjoy prom with your bf!", "NTA. The event is for everyone attending. Wear that dress and have fun there !", "NTA - your dress sounds lovely and I hope you have a great time. If there isn\u2019t a dress code somewhere, wear what makes you feel great. Skylar can stop enforcing her personal code on others.", "That is such a weird idea. She's essentially saying that your boyfriend, at his own senior prom, doesn't deserve to have his date look as formal as all the other dates because you aren't a senior. Go, look fabulous, and have a great time. NTA.", "NTA, enjoy prom. The other girl may have been justifying buying a short dress. Ignore her. Hope everyone has a great time!", "NTA Wouldn't you get more attention if everybody wear long dresses and just a few wear short dresses? And if everybody wears long dresses, how can you stand out, you mix right in? I don't understand her logic...

I have been to junior and senior proms and always wore long dresses", "NTA. You dress for the event.

NTA, wear your dress", "NTA. That is a weird assumption to make and not a thing.", "Absolutely NTA. It is your prom as much as it is anyone else\u2019s and I\u2019m sure you look lovely in your dress. Skylar\u2019s just jealous that you\u2019ll look better.

NTA", "NTA I went to 4 proms since I was invited every year of highschool and have never heard of that before and never once thought or cared what the other kids were wearing or what grades they were in.

Both are fine and totally normal! She's just being rude. Forget her and have fun!", "NTA, as someone who went to prom in high school, WE DON'T CARE.

Don\u2019t let anyones side eye ruin your fun. \nIf there is no Official dresscode difference for people Not graduating that year and your dress meets all other criteria (if there Even are any), Go ahead.

Your dress sounds lovely and I hope that the two of you have a wonderful time at prom!", "NTA.  A junior prom is sometimes less formal but anyone going to a formal prom should wear a floor length gown.", "NTA - when I was in HS in the late 90s, prom was for juniors and seniors. Anyone else had to be invited by a junior or a senior. In general, seniors wore long dresses juniors wore short but any color was fine. And that was by NO means an everyone follows it rule.  My best friend wore a floor length red halter dress (yes I still remember it, I just found the pictures last week going through old things) and she was only a sophomore! \n\nEnjoy Prom!", "NTA, that\u2019s not a thing at all. I went to a Junior Senior prom as a Sophomore and wore a full length dress.

I wonder what her made up rule would be about kids who don't even go to a physical school!!!", "Its not necessarily an \"imaginary rule\" but more of an \"unwritten rule\" depending on where you're from. I definitely heard this when I was in high school and most people followed it.\n\nRealistically, I don't think anyone cares but I wouldn't go so far as saying she's made up an imaginary rule.", "thank you! She also went with her boyfriend last year so I just thought she might know something I didnt.", "Well black is one of our school colors and blue isn't so I was also worried about that but thanks :)", "Thank you :)", "Thank you :)", "Seriously. Prom is a formal event regardless of grade. If you\u2019re invited, the dress code is formal. You can wear a shorter dress if you like, but a long dress is appropriate. Honestly it was uncommon to wear a short dress to prom in my day.", "I have heard it from parents trying to budget, so not using the dress OP has already bought would be counterproductive.

Thank you :)", "Good point :) Than kyou!", "Well he hasn't seen the dress yet but yes I like it haha! thank You :)", "That doesn't mean she can't be insecure about her looks. Most girls your age are because of the constant barrage of styles and rules that change practically overnight. \n\nThis is a trap to make you uncomfortable in how you look, nervous that you won't run your boyfriend's prom or that you will offend someone. Don't let her get under your skin. She also wants to, ultimately, get you to change your dress. \n\nWear what makes you feel beautiful, and ignore the jealous witch.", "I've never heard that rule, but I also come from a place where prom is a junior year thing and mostly only juniors go,  but freshman-senior were allowed to go regardless of invite.", "She doesn\u2019t. You dress for the event.  When people go to a wedding as someone\u2019s plus-one, they don\u2019t underdress because they are only a guest of a guest.

That\u2019s her choice. But you don\u2019t have to put up with her crap. Be confident in what you chose to wear, and have fun. And the bonus of that is that it\u2019ll piss her off even more. Win-win for you!", "Have fun! :)", "That's just bull. Wear what you want and are comfortable with.", "Yeah, its funny to see people downvote just because where they're from, that wasn't really a thing. Like I said, I don't think anyone would have cared, but it was an \"unwritten rule\" that I heard about. \n\nI'm not American - Prom in my area was for the graduating class but younger students were allowed to go as a +1 (which is where this \"rule\" would have been applied, although like I mentioned, its not like people enforced it).", "Now I\u2019m wondering where OP is from.  I feel pretty confident it\u2019s not a \u201crule\u201d anywhere in the US, but maybe it is in some other countries.\n\nI\u2019ve lived or had family in about half of the the states in the US and worked with people from every state."]}
