WTF is wrong with you.", "Wow. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\n\nThis is so insane it sounds like a joke.

Did she choose to have judgmental relatives?

The sad and pathetic ones are you.", "YTA.  And BIL is an AH\n\n\nThe only one who isn't an AH is your sister, who the entire family owes a MASSIVE apology. She did nothing wrong.

Yeah, YTA buddy.", "YTA\n\nYour family sound like judgemental AHs, I feel sorry for your sister. It\u2019s a reasonable, legitimate way to make money. Sex work is valid work.", "YTA. First for the slut shaming of women making a living- some times the only way they can. \n\nSecond for mocking your sister for what she chooses to do with her body. \n\nAnd worst of all, for siding with your BIL. He\u2019s the AH for using the platform, subscribing to his SIL and then talking about the \u201cshame\u201d of it at dinner. And acting all surprised when he got called out. \n\nYou owe your sister an apology and BIL needs to grow up.", "YTA 110%. You sat around essentially calling women with onlyfans \"sad\" (and I'd be willing to bet a lot worse), and yet she's the \"bad guy\" for calling out the hypocrisy of someone at the table? She's better off without all of you. Nice how the guy gets a free pass in all this. He's paying to watch his wife's sisters onlyfans, and that's aok by all of you. Sad", "YTA - This is pretty sexist that the man is the victim, and the woman is the offender. If your family thinks that only fans is morally degrading, then should this not apply equally to the content creators as to the subscribers. BIL took an oath to his wife to love, honor, and cherish her. Did BIL subscribe to only fans because he wanted to show his love to his wife, to honor her to prove he cherishes her. SIL should be directing her anger to her husband.", "YTA\n\nOk it\u2019s fair to have your opinions on topics like these, but you\u2019re really going to uninvite your sister but not your BIL!?! Honestly I find him to be the buggest AH here. \n\nThis man is literally subscribed to a family member\u2019s onlyfans! And he\u2019s lying about it!", "YTA there is nothing wrong with being on only fans. Your entire family are judgemental AHs.

And your judgemental AH family attacked her more.I hope your sister realizes how toxic all of you are and counts herself lucky to get you all out of her life.", "YTA", "Yeah, going with YTA here.\n\nYou all should be embarrassed for being judgemental AHs, especially your hypocrite BIL.", "YTA. This wasn't your sister's \"doing,\" it's your wife, SIL, and BIL's doing. Your sister wouldn't have had to show proof that BIL was a lying hypocrite if, oh, say, he wasn't a lying hypocrite. Family makes her feel like crap, she stands up for herself, and somehow everything is her fault while BIL who's totally creeping on a family member is somehow let off the hook? So glad your parents at least have your sister's back.", "YTA. Maybe you should uninvite that hypocrite BIL.  Or not uninvite anyone and just celebrate family. \n\nETA: she is your sister, why would you oust your sister for other people?", "YTA\n\nWhy is your sister banned but not BIL? Isn't he the one that started all this? Plus how creepy is it that he's following your sister? I think you all need a timeout this Christmas.", "YTA. It\u2019s just another story where the woman is shamed by other people for doing what she wants with her own body, whereas the man that is looking at other women than his wife (I consider what your BIL is doing is almost cheating) can do what he wants in OP\u2019s point of view because, you know \u00ab\u00a0he\u2019s a man\u00a0\u00bb. If you think that your sister doesn\u2019t respect herself by doing that, your sexist.

He even subscribes to watch your sister \ud83e\udd23 please explain to us how your sister is in the wrong?", "YTA. Why does it matter if someone has an onlyfans? Nothing wrong with it (as long as nothing illegal is going on). Plenty of women (and men too) use it to make extra money..Perfectly fine. Yall upset at her seem jealous IMO.", "YTA\n\nYour wife and your BIL\u2019s wife are truly the A H\u2019s here.", "YTA. So let me get this straight, the pathetic thing is her having an OF and not the men paying for a little bit of pretended female attention on OF because they can't get it for free \ud83e\udd14", "YTA You're defending a hypocrite.", "YTA. She didn't mention it until cornered, you'd not known previously so she's hardly an issue around family and your brother in law is a fecking hypocrite.", "YTA", "YTA - Sex work is legitimate work. They put in a lot of effort to produce the content so many men (you likely included) consume. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is a shame to see a family so devoid of respect for their fellow man (or woman). Pathetic excuse of a family. Shame be upon  you.", "The only non-asshole in this entire totally real tory is the mistreated sister.\n\nYTA", "I can only add another YTA.", "YTA 100%. The OF topic is another argument in itself, but on the situation you guys started talking about it and you and your BIL slut shamed OF workers and continued to harass your sister because she was getting upset. BIL full knowing she has one. Then, she reveals she does has one and that HE WILLINGLY PAYS FOR IT TO SEE A FAMILY MEMBER AT THE MINIMUM IN A BIKINI EVEN IF THEY ARE ONLY RELATED DUE TO HIS MARRIAGE. BIL humiliated himself you can\u2019t make fun of someone for something, then turn around and support it. Not to mention if he\u2019s paying for hers and you guys feel so strongly, does him paying for hookers in the background if SIL doesn\u2019t know but evidence showed up and he said it was lies mean that\u2019s true to. You can not support OF, but how you have treated your own sister when BIL here deserves ZERO support is disgusting", "YTA. So it\u2019s okay for BIL to subscribe to OF, but not okay for SIL to have own? Double standards much? Also are you saying that BIL was sitting there bashing students for using OF when he has a subscription? C\u2019mon, the hypocrisy is taking up so much room in your house I\u2019m surprised there is room for anyone to squeeze in there.", "So you're punishing your sister because your brother in law stepped in it? He railed against only fans. Ridiculed your sister for having an account. All she did was prove he was a hypocrite. YTA and upset with the wrong person. It's not your sister's fault your brother in law talks out his ass and he is an only fans subscribing horn dog peeping on your sister.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nWhy are you blaming your sister!! BIL\u2019s discomfort is his problem. Also, how creepy is it that he\u2019s a high school teacher and is talking so much about OF with his students. Is he making a list of who to follow after they graduate? Even if the conversations with the students were well intended, he\u2019s still a bloody hypocrite.  \n\nIf your in laws are upset, you need to ask why your sister is the one to be blamed. I\u2019m not trying to say that your sister is a victim for having OF, but she is most definitely the victim in this situation. \n\nYour inlaws suck and you need to stick up for your sister. Be better.", "YTA and so is everyone else at the table except your sister.\n\nThere's nothing \"low\" about sex work.  Now you've ruined Christmas for everyone because you all have hang-ups about sex work.  Shame on all of you.", "So he is viewing her account but don't want her around their children?  It seems that he is the creepy one, not her.  And he obviously knew she had an account but kept talking bad about it. Hypocrisy at its best.", "YTA\n\nOnlyfan or not, your sis is the better person here.\nBIL got called out and rightfully so.", "YTA.  They were harassing your sister, which you seem to think is ok.  She struck back and knocked a hypocrite off his perch.  Good for her.", "YTA\n\nHow people stoop so low? Really?\n\nSex work is still work and there is NOTHING wrong with it, obviously BIL doesn't seem to think so...", "YTA. Sex work is WORK. Shame on all of you who think you are better than people who work hard to support themselves and their families.\n\nWhy are some jobs that do bodily damage considered fine but Only Fans not. The whole mindset is sickly inverted. Construction workers, Coal miners and more all work hard for modest wages. They sacrifice their bodies to make an income and many wind up with permanent damage of various levels. In other words they sell their bodies.\n\nContrast that to Only Fans performers who often are self-employed and in total control of their own work and income. They sell their bodies but on their own terms and they keep all the profit. Good for them.\n\nYou and your slut-shaming family members suck. If you wanted to do the right thing you would apologize to your Sister. Also your BIL who subscribes to a family member should be the one shunned from family events.", "bait but if not YTA", "YTA\nSo, everyone said it is sooo sad that some young women have to go to onlyfan to get some money, and that's a pity, and when your sister says she's hot an Onlyfan account, then everyone is shaming her and ostracising her ?\nAnd your BIL is fully innocent ?\nAs an American, you know  the law of supply and demand. If there were no demand, there would be no supply, it's as simple as that. And there is no shame in selling your body, on Onlyfan it's not a lot different from being an actress. It's your sister's body, your sister's choice. And between working a bad paid, despised but honorable job, and working a very well paid and despised, but not honorable job, I would personnaly choose the not honorable one.", "Yeah\u2026YTA\u2026\nI know it is a big thing to shame those with OF. Makes everyone feel better about themselves. But, as a girl, mind your own business. She has it for a reason, be it financial or just because she is proud of her body, etc. you are entitled to your opinion, but you do not get to shame others just because they do not share that opinion. \n\nAnd refusing to blame the BIL for having followed her OF this entire time is terrible. Would you pat the man that groped a girl on the head and tell him it is ok \u2018because she wore a shirt her size.\u2019 Would you support the guy who doesn\u2019t take no for no at a bar, because \u2018girls shouldn\u2019t be at bars if they cannot handle it.\u2019 Victim shaming just because you feel like you are above them is wrong, and I hope you have no skeletons in your closet.
