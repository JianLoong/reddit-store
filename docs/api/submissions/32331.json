I could even be sympathetic towards your family, since their lives may be affected by your decisions, but honestly the fact that they are focusing on you not making dishes for Xmas really paints a pretty picture.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nWhile  I kind of understand the sister's position (she knows basically nothing about these kids other than the fact that they're foster kids and one tried stealing cigarettes), she only has a right to control who is invited to her house. You're respecting that by not bringing the kids, with the perfectly respectable choice of declining the invite altogether. \n\nThe fact that she's unwilling to treat some down-on-their-luck kids as if they're human says a lot about her. You're doing as best you can for these kids and that's worthy of every bit of respect.", "NTA\n\nThey are either part of your family or not.  You sister was being far too pushy and demanding.\n\n\"I'\u2019d be ruining the whole thing (I\u2019m helping her cook most the meals.) \"\n\nSounds like she fucked around and found out!", "NTA - \" I made this choice doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs too\"  So, was the entire family involved when you decided to get pregnant with your other children, did they cheer you on during the act?\n\nI would not go to Christmas at your sisters, I would stay home.  I would send out a message to the rest of your family very nicely stating that your sister did not welcome your family at her party, so you are having your own.  We welcome all who can embrace our expanded family to join us.\n\nPS - you really need to work on getting your husband to quit smoking.  I know it is hard, but it is not just his health that he is impacting.", "NTA.\n\nThe concerns your sister has are not relevant here, especially if they are a guise for wanting you there to cook.\n\nThat being said, I see many things in this story that deserve attention and proper care. \n\nBeing a foster parent usually comes with different challenges than being a type of parent through other methods. Foster children tend to need time, care, and attention above and beyond other children of similar ages. Your foster children likely need therapy and other tools to help them through this process.\n\nYour biological children also likely now need extra care. Taking in these children turns your family from a family of four to a family of six. It turns your eldest biological child into a middle child. It means your biological children are transitioning from a household with strong stability into a household where parental time and energy is more divided and understandably more focused on other children, where they will be exposed to struggles and conflicts that didn\u2019t exist before, and where they have to completely change how they identify within their family. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot for everyone.\n\nAs others have suggested I don\u2019t see how going to a big Christmas gathering this year is a good idea. \n\nI hope all of you, including your biological children, have the tools they need to navigate this. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is a great thing, and a positive thing about your husband\u2019s experiences is that he has knowledge going into fostering that many people don\u2019t about what foster children have potentially gone through before being placed and what they will need. I hope he finds some peace in that.\n\nWishing your entire immediate family the best.", "NTA\n\nThe children need loving parents.\n\nYou aren't ruining anything if you don't act as free kitchen helper.", "NTA.  Your sister however is a MAJOR AH.  Those children did not ask to be in Foster care.  They are just as deserving of Christmas gifts as anyone.\n\nI am glad you are sticking up for them.  Your sentiment that this is the perfect time was spot on.    My husband and myself adopted our 2 daughters from Foster care and everyone always states how lucky they are that we did that.  NO my girls were not lucky for what they had to endure before we adopted them.  Truth is we are the lucky ones.\n\nYou might be the first person to stick up for them.  So I say BRAVO to you.", "You are trying to do something very good here. Your extended family seems to be sabotaging you to some degree. Now you do not do something long term like fostering  with a view to whether these children can be suitable guests at a party or not. I have no way of knowing if they can, of course. But all things considering, maybe it will be better not to go this party this time? Surely the children need to familiarize themselves with the everyday living aspects of being with you, and that is the very most important thing right now? Best of luck with it!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nFrankly your family members sound pretty heartless. \n\nNot to mention they sound cheap.\nI mean, how hard can it be to buy a few extra presents?", "Sounds like if you were to adopt some children, your sister would be like they aren't really family since you didn't birth them. Thank you for being a great foster parent. As an adoptee we really need more families like you. Definitely not the asshole.", "Nta\nShe can have her REAL family help her cook", "NTA. Your heartless sister has plenty of time to make other accommodations for the food. It sounds like she only wanted you there for the free labor you provided.  You are doing right by your foster kids by declining the invite. Even if your sister wasn\u2019t such a massive AH, it would probably still be good to have a small celebration with just your immediate household. Christmas with a lot of strangers will probably be overwhelming for the girls.", "NTA. Wow, she wants your help with cooking, but she wants to skimp on gifts for foster children? How snooty and entitled can she be? I can't imagine being heartless enough to not want to make the children feel welcome. They're going to have a tough time as it is with all of these unfamiliar people. My only anxiety would be whether I could find a gift that they'd like.", "My family did foster care. We always treated them EXACTLY like any other family member. So did the rest of our family. I'm so sorry this is happening to you! Thank you for fostering & God Bless YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA. Your kids deserve better. We've been lucky that our family has been so excited to be aunties/uncles/grandparents to all our (foster) kids for as long as they've been in our home. They've sent welcome treats, birthday cards, Christmas presents, included them in family photos and vacations, because for however long they're with us, they're family. Your kids may be happiest and most regulated with a just-nuclear-family cozy Christmas at home.", "NTA", "NTA your family is if they celebrate Christmas only for gifts and not the real reason for the season", "NTA. Your sister sounds inconsiderate.  Those poor kids, but as other commenter have said, a large family gathering may be too much for them. Your sister will have to suck it up and cook herself. Tough.

You and your husband have good hearts and I question your sister's. She really needs some soul searching and realize that the season is about love and sharing with others. You guys are in the right, definitely. I'm willing to bet that someone else in your family can help her with the cooking. I hope your sister can realize how much the AH she is being!", "NTA. We were foster parents. When I told my mother, she bought the child clothes, toys, helped me set up the bedroom and make it welcoming, and included her in anything she included the other grandchildren. After an appropriate amount of time, the child was even included in the grandparent sleepovers with the other children. Your family is being absolutely awful and disgusting. I would treat them as no longer safe for my family. They can do some self reflection and make changes or not see their biological grandchildren either.", "NAH.\n\nYour sister is entitled to not want strangers at her home, particularly when one of those strangers was caught stealing. She could have been nicer about it, though. And she should have been more understanding when you said you wouldn't attend.\n\nI think it's very kind of you to take those girls in and to want to give them a nice holiday. But it's probably best for everyone if you don't take them to your sister's anyway. A big celebration with a ton of strangers could very well make them uncomfortable.", "The 12 year old was stealing?

Good on you to not subject them to that environment.", "NTA", "Esh but not what you asked for. You are NOT THE TA for standing up for your foster kids and not going. You are being a good foster mom. But your sis is completely right. You cant expect to foster kids ,and immediately expect family to accept them. Both of you are right. 1) you are right. No child deserves to be alone for christmas. 2) your sis is right. Its probably not at all good to bring the foster kids during christmas, because the family doesnt know them, and they dont know the family. If you think they would have bonded with them, then no, they would not have. And it would have been more miserable for them. You are the ta for expecting family to buy gifts for them. Thats your and your husband's job. You can ask them to not give gifts to your kids as well for this christmas ( to not exclude the foster kids). But you cant ask them to spend double of what they were originally going to spend ( 2 kids earlier. Now 4). Your sister is the Ta for saying \"do they even deserve it\" yes they do deserve a nice christmas. But she doesnt need to accomodate that. Troubled children deserve privileges. Children from tough backgrounds deserve love. But that is upto you and your husband to provide. Not the rest of your family. If they wanted to help, thats great. But you cant expect them .", "YTA for demanding your extended family treat these new additions to your household the same as the kids in the family. You haven't given anyone enough time to adjust and develop familiarity with eachother. There's no guarantee the foster kids will stay long enough to be there on Christmas. They may. They may not. You've only known them a few weeks.\n\nIt's nice you want to open your home to needy kids. It's unrealistic to expect- and intrusive to require- your extended family immediately take up your attitude towards the foster kids.\n\nHow are you managing this transition with your own children?
