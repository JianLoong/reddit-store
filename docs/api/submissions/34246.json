It's totally fair to not invite someone whose kid wrecked your stuff, especially if they didn't even offer to fix or replace it. Amiibos might be toys to some, but they're your collection and they matter to you. Lucy brushing off the damage and calling you childish is pretty rich. You have every right to protect your belongings. Not inviting her is just setting boundaries, not being petty. If she can't respect your stuff, she doesn't get an invite. Simple as that. You're good, man.", "NTA.\n\n\"I didn't forget you were my friend. I didn't invite you *on purpose*. Allowing your son to get into things he had no permission to, causing significant financial damage, and refusing to pay for it all have consequences.

Parents like her that take zero responsibility for their children are a giant problem and you handled it fairly well", "NTA taking your child to someone elses home and said child opens a cabinet to play with collectables is not acceptable.

End of story.", "NTA. The misconnect here is that Lucy obviously thinks your collection is silly, and toys are meant to be played with. She\u2019s missing the point, that they are something you value and enjoy, not to mention they are expensive, and as the parent it is her responsibility to compensate for any damages her kid does, intentionally or otherwise. If you value the friendship with her you should take the time to acknowledge her point of view - and I don\u2019t mean validate it - because she\u2019s wrong, but by acknowledging you can maybe help her understand where the misconnect is.

Tell mom to look in the mirror.", "I think OP is being too harsh on themselves. \n\nLucy's son came into OP's home, took something out of a case without permission and broke it. And then Lucy brushed it off. It's not the child I have a problem with, but the parenting. Kids do get into mischief, but parents should be shutting that down.

Took some off the wall. But my toys that are within reach are played with, and so while a hassle, ultimately it kept her happy so I could enjoy time with her parents. This same child asked about toys that were on higher shelves, and I explained those were not good to play with during a party.  We agreed on party friendly options, and all was good (she was around 6). \n\nHere is the thing, my house is mine. My things are mine. How I choose to share them is up to me. I was sad and obsessed a little over never finding polly pockets shoes, even though I had other options. While I thought about it more than I wanted to, ultimately, I fully believed Polly was a toy, and every doll loses at least 1 shoe. So I was not mad or looking for a replacement. But I would have been furious if an uppershelf toy were missing parts. You may see my toy \"collection\" as silly and children's toys, and that's fine. But  since they are mine, you can not treat them disrespectfully. Period, end of statement. I may think a sneaker collection is a bit dumb (i dont get it, in full honesty, I respect any cultivated collection, if its important you, its not dumb), but I don't purposefully walk on your new shoes. It's basic respect. If you are bringing a child to an adult gathering, you should have something to entertain them. And if they get into something, you should be apologetic, and if you can afford it, replace a broken item. And if you can't afford it, so if there is another way to make it up to the person. \n\nNo one has the right to belittle your likes in your home and also be mad they aren't invited back. NTA", "YTA.

You could have explained that her refusal to take responsibility has soured you on having her over. \n\nAnd I know the reddit peeps are going to say \u201cnaw it\u2019s your home you get to do what you want and mom is in wrong\u201d. And while I get the \u201cblack and white\u201d nature of that, you chose a childish route and excluded someone that\u2019s always been included and didn\u2019t even attempt to communicate like an adult.

She should have been better supervising her child. You, as host, should have gone over your apartment before any party guests arrived if you knew there were going to be little kids coming that night and put away and secured anything you worried might be broken. \n\nIf she had refused to split the cost of the broken figures with you, then I think you would be completely reasonable for not inviting her again. But asking her to pay the full cost when you are half at fault here I think is a bit much.", "ESH.

And the parent should be genuflecting themselves for their kids' fuckup.", "Kiddo, when you have kids of your own, you will understand that \"six year old sometimes takes toys that aren't his\" isn't an indicator of \"shitty parenting\", any more than your pottymouth is an indicator that your parents didn't bring you up right.", ">hey shouldn't be taking toys in the first place, and you're excusing that behavior. And the parent should be genuflecting themselves for their kids' fuckup.\n\nRight, right, because the important thing here is the parent of the kid who takes toys should genuflect to the other parents. That's so much more important than aaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnyyyything else, in your world.", "I am an adult who works in childcare.\n\nA six year old who doesn't know how to a) keep his hands from things that aren't his and b) doesn't know that playing =/= breaking things (Amiibos are really hard to break in my experience).\n\nA parent who refuses to take accountability for her child's actions (financially and personally) and seemingly doesn't hold her child accountable.\n\nDoesn't take a genius to figure out what the problem is \"kiddo\".", "Thank you for that insight into the mind of a shitty parent.", "Not a kid here but downplaying a six year old taking others toys regularly IS bad parenting. If one of my kids did this they would be made to bring them back and apologize. No one is saying to scream at the kid or make a huge deal of it, but laughing off poor behavior and doing nothing about it so it keeps happening does mean you are a bad parent. Based on your responses to others id say it\u2019s pretty clear who wasn\u2019t raised well here and who is raising their kids poorly.", "\"I'm a bad parent, and someday if you are too, you'll agree with me.\"   \n\n\nA person doesn't have to be young or childless to think you're probably the type of \"my kid is more important than anyone else's concerns or problems\" parent being critiqued.", "Don't do the crime if you don't want to do the time.", "It\u2019s not about how it affects the kid. It\u2019s the decency of knowing your kid is a little shit , you are his breeder , he acts like a brat, therefore you apologise. \n\nIt\u2019s your own business what you teach your child , but when that child breaks people\u2019s property and steals things, and you laughing about it , it just proves that not only is the kid shitty but so is the mother.\n\nAnd therefore everyone would be more than justified to exclude them both."]}
