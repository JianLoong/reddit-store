It's totally fair to not invite someone whose kid wrecked your stuff, especially if they didn't even offer to fix or replace it. Amiibos might be toys to some, but they're your collection and they matter to you. Lucy brushing off the damage and calling you childish is pretty rich. You have every right to protect your belongings. Not inviting her is just setting boundaries, not being petty. If she can't respect your stuff, she doesn't get an invite. Simple as that. You're good, man.", "NTA.\n\n\"I didn't forget you were my friend. I didn't invite you *on purpose*. Allowing your son to get into things he had no permission to, causing significant financial damage, and refusing to pay for it all have consequences.

I know how expensive some of those amiibos can be and how rare they are and I absolutely wouldn't want any risk of them being damaged if they were mine so I can totally Understand your decision there. Parents like her that take zero responsibility for their children are a giant problem and you handled it fairly well", "NTA taking your child to someone elses home and said child opens a cabinet to play with collectables is not acceptable.  Even less acceptable is her failure to compensate for the damage her child caused.  Actions come with consequences.  This wasn't an accident, it was deliberate.", "NTA", "NTA at all.

End of story.", "NTA. The misconnect here is that Lucy obviously thinks your collection is silly, and toys are meant to be played with. She\u2019s missing the point, that they are something you value and enjoy, not to mention they are expensive, and as the parent it is her responsibility to compensate for any damages her kid does, intentionally or otherwise. If you value the friendship with her you should take the time to acknowledge her point of view - and I don\u2019t mean validate it - because she\u2019s wrong, but by acknowledging you can maybe help her understand where the misconnect is.

And then Lucy brushed it off. It's not the child I have a problem with, but the parenting. Kids do get into mischief, but parents should be shutting that down.

Took some off the wall. But my toys that are within reach are played with, and so while a hassle, ultimately it kept her happy so I could enjoy time with her parents. This same child asked about toys that were on higher shelves, and I explained those were not good to play with during a party.  We agreed on party friendly options, and all was good (she was around 6). \n\nHere is the thing, my house is mine. My things are mine. How I choose to share them is up to me. I was sad and obsessed a little over never finding polly pockets shoes, even though I had other options. While I thought about it more than I wanted to, ultimately, I fully believed Polly was a toy, and every doll loses at least 1 shoe. So I was not mad or looking for a replacement. But I would have been furious if an uppershelf toy were missing parts. You may see my toy \"collection\" as silly and children's toys, and that's fine. But  since they are mine, you can not treat them disrespectfully. Period, end of statement. I may think a sneaker collection is a bit dumb (i dont get it, in full honesty, I respect any cultivated collection, if its important you, its not dumb), but I don't purposefully walk on your new shoes. It's basic respect. If you are bringing a child to an adult gathering, you should have something to entertain them. And if they get into something, you should be apologetic, and if you can afford it, replace a broken item. And if you can't afford it, so if there is another way to make it up to the person. \n\nNo one has the right to belittle your likes in your home and also be mad they aren't invited back. NTA", "YTA.

You could have explained that her refusal to take responsibility has soured you on having her over. \n\nAnd I know the reddit peeps are going to say \u201cnaw it\u2019s your home you get to do what you want and mom is in wrong\u201d. And while I get the \u201cblack and white\u201d nature of that, you chose a childish route and excluded someone that\u2019s always been included and didn\u2019t even attempt to communicate like an adult.

Her refusing to pay once asked is what absolutely makes her the AH and OP NTA.  \n\nHad OP been babysitting and responsible for the child at the time, then I would agree the mom wouldn't be responsible for the damage, but the child was her responsibility at the party and she should absolutely have covered any damage.
