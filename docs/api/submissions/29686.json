I teach on a platform which is very flexible, I click the \"available\" button and all students can see I am free and somebody calls me. Its perfect since there's no scheduling, students and tutors just go on whenever we are free. \n\nRecently there's been this kid who I just find so obnoxious. He interrupts everything I say, he disregards the lesson, talks about dumbass stuff, sometimes screams and he has siblings who are also screaming in the background. He'll run out of the room to yell at his siblings and come back. He has a very annoying voice and he'll also go from talking quietly to yelling, talking while close and far from the microphone causing me to have to adjust the volume constantly. He complains about everything. He is the only student out of hundreds I have taught that I can't stand. \n\nI lost my shit recently when I got an email from the company I teach on saying a student reported me for being \"unprofessional\" and \"doing activities other than teaching\". I don't know what he reported me for but what happened is my phone fell off a table while it was charging. I walked back, picked it up and plugged it back in. Was at most 10 seconds, likely fewer. He asked me a bunch of questions about what I was doing and was really fascinated about it. \n\nAfter finding out this kid reported me I decided I was fed up with him. I'm not allowed to reject calls from any student when they call me, he tried to call me on 3 different days and I just turned off my internet so it seems like there was a connection error. Later he sent me an email asking me when I was free and if we could schedule a call. I just ignored it. I got called by the platform asking me about this and I just said \"I don't know there's been connection issues and I didn't see the emails\". The staff told me this kid really likes my lessons and wants me to teach him. Fuck that shit, that little bitch reported me for something so petty. This isn't some form he just had to fill out after a lesson, he actually went out of his way to contact the staff and tell them that and likely lied about what happened too. \n\nI got 2 more emails from him asking if we could schedule a lesson and if I'm ignoring him. I just didn't respond.

He reported you for something minor, and you no longer feel comfortable or happy tutoring him. There should be an option to not tutor him. If not, then you will have to decide what to do in the future as it will affect your other calls. You may end up deciding that the site doesn't suit you if you are unable to refuse clients. It seems like a flawed system if that is the case.", "If there\u2019s a way for him to report you then there\u2019s probably a way for you to report him\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you can't ignore him forever. it's a pretty shitty job if you can't, under any circumstances,  not tutor a specific kid. you need to resolve this somehow.", "NTA, though a bit passive-aggressive. I\u2019m surprised the platform doesn\u2019t have a way to blacklist users for being disruptive.", "NTA as I personally empathise with you\n\nAre you sure the platform literally forces you to accept all calls? Is that normal among such platforms? Because quite frankly it's a very bad job if some annoying kid can easily just psychologically torture you like that since you have absolutely no weapon whatsoever and your hands are tied. \n\nI would either seek to change platform or I would find a way to record this little monster and just present evidence as soon as he tries to pull some BS.", "NTA but I\u2019m confused; INFO the platform told you who reported you but not what they reported you for? And expects you to keep working with someone who reported you, risking your reputation with an unreliable client? F that.", "NTA\n\nHe's a twerp, keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. That's really odd that the platform has no way to protect you from harassment from a student.", "So if a student was being verbally abusive, racist, making sexual comments etc you are not allowed to block them? Maybe it\u2019s time to start your own tutoring business, if this company doesnt support its staff it deserves to lose clients.", "Does the terms of your service require you to work with anyone? Double check the terms. If you are required to accept anyone, then you are in the wrong. Maybe not full on asshole, but wrong. If you are free to pick and choose, then you have done nothing wrong at all.\n\nThat said, I know many lawyers won't work with clients who have made complaints, given negative reviews, etc. Various bar associations have said that creates a hostile relationship. While that doesn't directly apply to tutoring, it seems like a reasonable policy.", "NTA.", "NTA\nIf you\u2019re 100% sure he.she reported you.  Are you 100% sure or are you assuming? Either way, if the child annoys you and you don\u2019t enjoy teaching him/her, you have every right to deny your services. You should enjoy what you do. You\u2019re not a babysitter.", "NTA but you can't ignore him forever! Maybe talk with the company and explain why you don't want to deal with this kid. I'd totally back you if I could, kids like that don't deserve an education. Wish you the best of luck", "NAH. as a teacher myself, I understand your frustration. He wants to assert dominance over you so he can keep pulling crap like that.", "How sure or you that the kids reported you? I'm not judging yet, I just want to know", "Info- do you know for a fact that he's the one that reported you? Something like that sounds like it's supposed to be anonymous to protect against retaliation exactly like this.", "NTA", "there should be a way to counter report. NTA", "You don't even know the kid was the one who reported you, and you're just being petty towards a literal child. You have no evidence of wrongdoing besides you finding him annoying.\n\nYou're NTA by the skin of your teeth, but for god's sake, contact the staff and tell them you refuse to work with someone so disruptive, stop just avoiding the kid. He might not even understand what he's doing is wrong (again, he's a literal child). He may even have some sort of learning disability, and not be able to help it.\n\nYou don't need to deal with a student that you can't work with, but you do need to be mature and professional about it. Breaking the rules of the company just so you don't have to deal with him is the exact opposite.", "ESH\n\nYeah kids are annoying and I\u2019d hate to tutor him to.\n\nBut your job requires you to help anyone regardless if you like them or not. Also what\u2019s your endgame here? Eventually people are gonna catch on that you\u2019re ignoring him. You\u2019re not doing yourself any favours doing this!", "Get a new job. Also, maybe grow up a little as one of your complaints is 'he has an annoying voice', are you sure you're the adult in this tutoring gig?", "NTA. The kid seems to be an AH, But kids generally arent perfect. You can try telling him about the issues. If he doesnt improve, I am sure you can report him too. You can be honest,  If you are as good as you say, The platform will not want to lose you over a single student and assign different tutor to him. You cant continue ignoring him forever. How do you know this is the same kid who reported you? If the platform told you, Then it as an AH platform, Generally there would be reasonable privacy for people who raise issues to prevent retaliation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you are not required to schedule classes and, as it sounds like, the perk of this job is the flexibility, just tell him that. You usually don't schedule because you don't have a clear idea of when you can be online. Then keep disconnecting on this kid and hope he leaves you alone. Or instead tell him you're also following other kids and teaching him so many times AND scheduling with him will be hard, but you'll let him know of some time frees up", "ESH You are a teacher and he is a kid. Let him know that you don\u2019t accept that kind of behaviour. None of the behaviour.", "NTA, you shouldn't tutor him if he makes you uncomfortable. At the same time, you re the adult. Accept his call or arrange a time for a call and be honest. \"I was told you you are not happy with the way i am teaching you and that i have been unprofessional, therefore i am not sure how we can continue or why you would even want to\" - simple as that...no grudges, no accusations like \"oh, you reported me\" etc. And make sure you record everything.", "NTA.  It would be best to reject the calls outright and tell the platform you are having issues with this client.  Even better if the platform allows you to block the person.  You can also \"go out of your way\" and talk to the staff about the issues you are having and explain you don't want to tutor this person.", "Yeah there are too many \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios that necessitate a tutor needing to drop a client for a variety of valid reasons.
