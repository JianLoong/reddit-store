It's not your responsibility to bank roll your friend and her trying to manipulate you is dirty. She doesn't sound \"generous with her money\" she sound stupid. Why is she paying for towing and vet appointments? Both of which are usually very expensive. It's not your responsibility to teach her how to be financially responsible. I'd be rethinking continuing this friendship, at least until she has her own job.", "NTA. Your friend is a dick. Who invites someone to visit and then is like \"you're not gonna pay to be here????\"... lol", "NTA.  All the red flags there on that friend. She invited you.  I'm sure you did something kind for her on your visit. And she is asking for money after paying for other friends' issues?  If she has that kind of money to spend and share, she is obviously doing okay for herself.", "NTA. I'm sorry your friendship with her has somehow devolved into a money-centric one.", "NTA. Of course you don't pay to stay over at a friend's place for a week, and of course you should not pay your friends' bills simply because you have a bit more money.", "NTA. This relationship reminds me of my best friend and I. I\u2019m the struggling university student, and she is the full time time worker who is able to spoil her self occasionally. However, I would never ever expect her to support me financially. She has her own life goals and she works very hard! I respect that. \n\nAlthough she is you\u2019re best friend, it is not an obligation to help her financially. Part of being a full time student is being broke, and there are ways to work around that without guilting your friends. As an adult, she should understand that you have your own bills to pay and own goals to reach. Plus, you\u2019ve helped her out with things in the past, so your clearly a good friend.", "NTA NTA NTA! It was her choice to be overly generous with her own money, that doesn\u2019t mean you owe her yours. And she invited you to see her, she\u2019s not \u201cgiving you\u201d a place to stay. Where does she get the audacity to demand what you worked hard for? Some people act so entitled I don\u2019t know how they wipe their own butts without complaining about it. You owe her nothing. I\u2019d go low contact after the trip and explain to her that her financial demands made you highly uncomfortable.", "NTA. She's not entitled to your money at all. And to pay for some of her random friends you likely aren't friends with - maybe she can be friends with them and you can find people who won't try to treat you like an ATM", "NTA for not helping her. But when you're sitting with an unemployed student in university accommodations, musing aloud about spending close to a grand on a ticket for a game is kinda gauche. (Beat the 'Stros please!)", "NTA You're acting like a responsible adult while your friend is acting like a teenager.", "NTA. I had a family member like that. She came to visit me, by train because she preferred that. Fine, but I drove 35+ minutes each way to pick her up, down to the beach, and back to my apt, and then another day, 120+ miles to outlets to shop. Not once did I ask her to pay for anything or gas money. She did pay for dinner one night, which was nice.\n\nthen I went to visit her. we also drove a decent distance to another oulet center, and she made some comment about me needing to give her gas money. I'm sorry, what? she is cheaper than cheap, except when it comes to her. And at that time, she probably made 3X what I did. \n\nYou shouldn't feel guilty at all. you are in different stages of life, and you happen to be in one earining money. She is not. But that doesn't mean you owe her anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

What\u2019s frustrating is that she feels entitled to your money in any way. She\u2019s not. If she wants to give her money out to other people, that\u2019s on her.

She's not \"giving\" you a free place to stay-- she invited you to come visit her, presumably because you both enjoy spending time together. You paid to fly out to see her, she invited you to stay at her home. That's...typically how friendship works. If she *needed* money and *asked* whether you could help her out with something, it's fine to ask a friend that, but making weird insinuations and trying to make you feel guilty without directly asking for help (and it doesn't seem like she *needs* financial help at the moment if she has the money to pay for other people's tows and vet bills) is not cool.", "i think this is part of why i feel guilty. i\u2019m a huge baseball fan and was just really excited about my team going to the world series. i do realize that does make it seem like i was rubbing it in her face that i do have money but i was just very exciting and wasn\u2019t thinking.", "Believe me, as a Mets fan I was hoping for that excitement this year... But yeah, your friend sticking her hand out like you've got money you're just dying to throw around was really rude, and going to a WS game is worth the splurge!"]}
