It\u2019s not healthy.", "Sorry if this is out of line, but are you sure he is being up front with his friends about how he wants to spend the time with you and it's his idea? I kind of wondered if he's growing apart from them a bit and lets them run with their assumptions it's you.", "Um\u2026 your partner is not a small child that you have to organise play dates for lol. Sounds like it\u2019s up to him to either tell his friends to grow up, or get some new friends. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nFirst of all, you\u2019re not stopping him, if he wanted to see his friends more, he could. Secondly, I agree with you that those guys might be good colleagues to hand out to a party or something but not REAL good friends. They seem childish, and your boyfriend probably noticed it.\nIf he feels like to, he could talk to his current friends and be real about it (if they\u2019re really friends, they will understand it and change their speech). \nSo, you have nothing to worry about.  If you want to, you can encourage your boyfriend to hang out with some friends of yours, or maybe encourage him to meet some new guys to be his friends.", "Honestly it\u2019s not your fault. People think and assume and you can\u2019t change sometimes that even if you try. Honestly sounds like a them problem because obviously they sound like they don\u2019t have gfs or give up enough time to be with their gfs. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f On a real note It shouldn\u2019t bother you. What\u2019s good is that your boyfriend knows well your true intentions and that you\u2019re not trying to keep him away from his friends. If it bothers you that much then all you can do is you talk to them, but either way I\u2019d say you\u2019re fine and sounds like your husband has the best relationship out of his friends Lol", "NTA\nBut you could encourage his friends to get girlfriends.\n\nThat should solve the problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like he\u2019s growing apart from these friends and doesn\u2019t really want to see them anymore, but is kinda stringing them along. \n\nIt does hurt to be essentially ditched by a friend when they pair off, while they still pay lip service to your friendship. You can\u2019t really expect them to act like \u201ctrue friends\u201d and be happy for him when he\u2019s not treating them like true friends. \n\nBut, this is all on your bf to manage.

It sounds like his buddies need to do a bit of growing up! Good luck!"]}
