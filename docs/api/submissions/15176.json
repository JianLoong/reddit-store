I thought she complained the last time she went because she doesnt like camping? Why does she even want to go again?\n\nSounds like the perfect weekend for her mom to have a spa date with her or something.....", "NTA.  This is your son's birthday weekend and he wants to go camping. Your wife and her daughter don't even LIKE camping so they should let you two go camping and the girls can do something they enjoy.   And you and your son should ABSOLUTELY not give up your trip so you can entertain your ungrateful stepdaughter.", "NTA. This is your son's BD trip, and should only be about him.  You are going to have to make more of an effort to give her more attention when she is at your house, and do special things with her.  It sounds like it may be time for some family therapy afterwards, if this doesn't help.", "NTA - take your son and both of you enjoy your trip.  \n\nYour wife should be spending that time bonding with her daughter.  She is the one that is causing her daughter to stay away.", "NTA. If stepdaughter is feeling ignored, that\u2019s on your wife, not you. You would be YTA if you cancelled the trip, it\u2019s your sons birthday.", "Maybe ask the stepdaughter if she would like to go camping? She\u2019d likely say no. If she says yes then great, plan a bonding trip for just her and her mother the weekend after your trip, or offer to take step-daughter for a bonding trip just the two of you, but keep your son\u2019s trip separate.", "NTA- stepdaughter is feeling ignored. Your wife should plan something fun for just them to do, a nice break away from her step Brother, since they dont get along.", "NTA. This trip with your sun is a tradition, and it's only 1 weekend. There are 25 other weekends when you can spend time with your step-daughter. There's no reason to give up this 1, and if you did, your son would resent you.", "How many more birthdays with your son do you have before he strikes out on his own, and these trips are harder and harder to take? \n\nNTA. Go camping.", "NTA. This sub is filled with posts from kids in your son and stepdaughters situation and there is always resentment aimed at the parents and the other kids. You can't force them to be siblings. If they get along, great. If not, they should at least be civil. Try and force something and you will have a bad time.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t your wife spend time with her own daughter? Why should you and your son have to cancel the birthday camping trip?", "So your wife's ex is trying to influence how you spend time with your kid. Your wife needs to understand that it's your SON'S BIRTHDAY and you want to do something that HE wants.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Firstly, they don't get along and the entire point of the trip is to celebrate your son's birthday.  Bringing someone along who is just going to ruin the trip completely wrecks that.  Secondly, she doesn't like camping anyway so there's no reason to invite her.", "Nta. The girl wants nothing to do with you until it's going to ruin her step brothers birthday. And wife is not healthy or helpful", "NTA  This sounds like the perfect chance for a mother-daughter weekend for the two of them, full of things they do enjoy.", "NTA. I have 5 bio kids myself and my two oldest LOVE hiking, camping, and traveling to different state parks. My two younger kids enjoy the outdoors but camping and hiking, not so much. I go on at least two camping trips a year with my older kids and leave the younger ones at home. It\u2019s definitely not as fun to camp if you have people complaining the whole time. It\u2019s your sons birthday and it\u2019s what he wants to do, he shouldn\u2019t have to deal with constant complaining and trying to change plans on his day.", "NTA.  You are doing something special for your son's birthday that the two of you enjoy.  I would recommend try to do something all together the next weekend your SD is with you, and make sure to do something special on/for her birthday.", "NTA. Cancelling your son's birthday trip in favor of taking your SD on a trip is NOT the answer.  You son should not be thrown over because SD is feeling ignored.  Family counseling.", "NTA. Why would you cancel your sons birthday event?", "NTA. If she feels ignored I would bet that it's her mom she wants attention from. As far as you've said at least she's never specified that you or your son dont spend enough time with her.", "Nope.  That weekend, you each do something special with your own kid.  Your wife can set up a spa day or another \u201cgirls only\u201d activity while you\u2019re camping with your son.  NTA", "Don't cancel. Make it a father/son trip.", "NTA wtf wrong with your wife? \n\nLet me give you the plan for the weekend.. you and your son go camping your ,wife then has the opportunity to spend time one on one with her daughter.. Mom is too busy trying to forcefully combine her daughter into her new family that she\u2019s not realizing that once her daughter goes to college and she doesn\u2019t put any real effort into her personal relationship with her daughter she won\u2019t have a relationship at all with her \u2026 this isn\u2019t on you ,your son(who I\u2019m assuming she ignores) or the ex.. her relationship with her daughter is solely on her!! Talk to her and give her something to think about besides trying to force together puzzle pieces that don\u2019t fit", "NTA, they didn\u2019t enjoy it last year, she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you, she\u2019s not get along with the son, AND it is the sons birthday. Why I\u2019m the world should you cancel your sons birthday festivities to hang out with her instead? Your wife is out of line here", "Exactly! It's his BIRTHDAY trip!\n\nWhat do you and your wife do for her daughter's birthday? Why doesn't your wife want to do something with her on her own?", "No, my wife hates camping. She won't go ever again", "How do you figure? I would guess daughter deeply dislikes step dad and step brother, that\u2019s usually the case. \nThat\u2019s a pretty lopsided custody agreement, I wonder if daughter has to be dragged to visit mom.", "And neither the wife nor the daughter like camping! \n\nGo get mani/pedis. Have a movie nights build legos, take a day painting/pottery class.  Go on a hike,  go to a concert, go fishing. Anything. \nMother daughter weekend and father son weekend. Nothing wrong with that.", "She should plan a girls trip with her daughter while you two are away.", "I thought this too, it's probably her mother's attention she wants, not the people she has repeatedly told they are not family and who she declines to spend time with.", "It\u2019s also possible mom is trying to push the family vibe? \n\nBut since the so. Is *always* there and daughter is not, daughter may not feel like it\u2019s home?\n\nAnd if mom is pushing the new family thing,  daughter also may be upset that she never gets mom to herself? Because her step bro and dad are always around? \n\nA mother daughter weekend may actually do more to smooth this whole thing."]}
