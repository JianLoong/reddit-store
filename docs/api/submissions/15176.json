A good question is why your wife does not take you and your son being away that weekend as an opportunity for her and her daughter to have a girl\u2019s weekend.  Why isn\u2019t your wife setting up activities to share with her daughter that will bring them closer, build memories, and take advantage of the \u201cguys\u201d not being around.  \n\nYour son is your child.

Suggest tickets to a play or musical or concert for the two of them.  Suggest Mom and daughter try rock climbing if you have a facility for that locally.
