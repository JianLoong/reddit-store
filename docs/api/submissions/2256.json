The driver of the car may not be handicapped, most permanently handicapped people have handicapped license tags, the person driving the car may not be the person to whom the handicapped placard belongs, but what we do know is that the driver, handicapped or not, didnt care one bit that parking in someone elses spot may be inconveniencing the person who OWNS the spot \n\nThe person parking in spot  knew it doesn't belong to  them, parked there  despite numerous signs warning against it, despite knowing they may be preventing the OWNER of the spot from parking in their own spot, leads me to believe they are not a \"nice\" neighbor or person for that matter. They are selfish and self-centered caring only for their desire to park there.  So if OP had not taken what you seem to think was harsh and unnecessary stance, i 100% guarantee the person would keep parking there.
