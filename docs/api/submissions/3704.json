Your mom is really overbearing and is being a total helicopter parent. As a teenager, you should have a right to a reasonable amount of privacy. If your mom wants to see what you\u2019re doing, she can put parental controls on your phone instead of rummaging through your things.\n\nI don\u2019t constantly monitor my kids\u2019 phones 24/7 because I trust them. If I find something questionable, I have a talk with them, and if I\u2019m notified that they\u2019re doing things they\u2019re not supposed to, if it\u2019s a severe issue, I take their phones away.\n\nOur job as parents isn\u2019t to make our children feel like they\u2019re walking on eggshells and have no privacy whatsoever. It\u2019s not to make our children feel as if they are not a completely separate human being with their own interests and activities. It is our responsibility to parent and to monitor them, but not to step up our monitoring to where we have to watch them like a hawk 24/7 with every step and breath they take. Your mom is too controlling and overbearing and she needs to get therapy to help her pinpoint where this behavior is coming from and what\u2019s causing her to not trust you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I can't imagine you wouldn't be frustrated, as it's a total invasion of your privacy. Parents often tend to forget that they don't OWN their children. It can really be overwhelming and lead to serious arguments. You have nothing to apologize for. Do you have anyone to talk to in the family, who would understand and support you, maybe would try to talk some sense into your mom and dad?", "NTA.  At 14 you won't get ALL of the privacies, but you should get a fair few of them.  You should be able to have private conversations with your friends etc...  She's being invasive and waaay too over-protective, also untrusting.  When does she plan to cut the umbilical?", "NTA for being upset at the breach of trust and broken promise.  You do need to accept that you are only 14 and the amount of trouble you could get into on the internet is enough to make any caring parent insane.  That being said, you are old enough to start taking responsibility for your own actions and to have a bit more autonomy.  Another comment pointed out that she would do better to teach you how to protect yourself rather than just hover--is that even possible? Is there a counselor or other appropriate 3rd party who might be able to help the two of you come to an agreement on limits to keep you safe that still give you some privacy?  Of course, she has to stand by anything agreed unless there is actual evidence you have broken the rules or gotten into trouble.", "NTA. I know you're getting some flack because you're only 14 and such.  People forget that all the bad stuff that we hear about online has been happening for decades, but we werent as connected as we are now. So with everything just blasting in her face about the dangers of the world all the time, I get it. \n\nHowever, as many have said, a parent's job is to love and be there when you make mistakes. You should be able to feel like you can trust your parents that way they can guide you into not being an idiot lol.  She breached your trust which is not okay because she's doing the exact opposite of what she wants to achieve and that's to protect you.  I know you whipper snappers will always find workarounds because when we were kids we did the same thing.  Hell at 17 I flew across the country to go to a convention and lied to my mom that I was going to the beach for the weekend with my friend (which my friend agreed to help with the lie).  In hindsight as an adult I'm surprised I never have been abducted with all the poor choices I made. \n\nI don't think you should apologize but I do think you should sit your parents down and explain that you do love them and see what they're trying to do, but you want to be able to come to them when you have a problem vs waiting for you to do something wrong.\n\nEDIT: apologize for screaming though.  Yes emotions were hot, but getting screamed at by anyone kind of sucks.", "NTA\n\nI mean, as your mother unfortunately you have no right to privacy, so she can look through your stuff. But she told you she wouldn't, and did it anyway. That's a huge violation of not only your privacy but your trust. She lied to you. She should apologize.", "NTA, but with qualifications. \n\nYour problem isn\u2019t that your mom looks through your phone. Honestly, that\u2019s pretty common for people your age, and there are (sometimes) compelling reasons for doing so. \n\nYour problem is that your mom is LYING to you about what she\u2019s doing on your phone. That\u2019s asshole behavior, plain and simple. \n\nYou aren\u2019t my daughter, but if you were then here\u2019s the rule: \n\n\u201cFrom time to time, I need to look at your online conversation and the content that you\u2019re sharing with the world. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t trust you, but there are millions of bad people out there, and some of them are very good at deceiving other people. Tons of adults are duped by such people, and as a teenage girl, you have a target painted on your back. I\u2019m just trying to keep you safe. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal, though: When I check your phone, I\u2019m going to do it openly, and in your presence. I\u2019m not trying to get in the middle of all your relationships or police how you converse, but I need to be aware of who you\u2019re talking with and how you are handling yourself. Any new contacts are specifically concerning, particularly if you don\u2019t know them in real life. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to snoop on your personal conversations, but I do need to ensure that you are safe. If you have any questions, please come to me and let\u2019s talk about them. We should also talk about the permanent nature of anything you share electronically, particularly on social media. Again, I\u2019m not trying to snoop or dictate what you share, but it\u2019s important for you to understand how such things can follow you for a very, very long time. Bad posts can cost you scholarships, jobs and relationships for years to come. I love you, and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to keep you safe, while also respecting your autonomy and right to your own life.\u201d", "INFO: what is she finding on your phone?", "NTA. If your mom is concerned about your protection, reminder her that she'd be better off teaching you how to protect yourself. You aren't going to be living together forever, after all.

Dad and step mom acted like your mom. Friend talked to the kid about safety and respectful relationships and treated kid like a person. Kid's friends started bullying her through messages.

I understand you want some privacy, but your phone is not the place to have it. You are still a child and the internet is a very vulnerable place for someone your age.\n\nYour mom pays for your devices, and she is still your legal guardian, so she is entitled to protect you by making sure you don't engage in unsafe behaviors.", "Esh. My kid is 14 and I don't even let her have a phone anymore since she can't be trusted with it. It's scary being a parent to a teen these days. She means well and is doing what she thinks is best for you. Cut her some slack. This isn't forever. With time, trust builds and you'll get more privacy. Don't abuse the trust and you will earn more privacy. Growing up is rough, but with time and patience you'll get through it.", "YTA first of all, you don\u2019t own the phone or pay for it. Secondly, you screamed at her and you need to handle your anger in a different way, lastly it is a well known fact that there are all kinds of predators on the internet as well as cyber bullying. She has the right to check. When you have a legal job, are 18 and an adult, then you get to make the rules. Don\u2019t scream at people either it never helps any situation and it doesn\u2019t even make you feel better.", "NTA, OP change your phone password ASAP, if she complain you can just remember her of her promisse", "NTA.... tell mom since she has made it clear that lying is acceptable, then you will start lying to her too.... seems reasonable, right....?", "YTA. You are a child and it's kind of her job to make sure you're not doing anything you shouldn't be doing. Your phone is a luxury she lets you have. Most parents have logs on their child's cell phone to see who they are talking to and what apps they are using.", "In the US in the last week there was a story about a 15 year old girl. She was talking online to a \"boy\" who decided to drive cross country to see her. This 28 year old man then killed her family and set fire to the house and kidnapped her.

If you have never been given any than it can be hard when you start to become more independent. This is also hard for her. Truthfully you are both going through growing pains.\n\nYou need to sit down and talk with both parents normally. Find out what she is scared of and make a plan on how to handle it. So if we are home alone and I close my door what do you think is going to happen. If I have this app what do you think will happen. LISTEN to her some fears (if she will even tell you) will probably sound crazy but listen. After she explains tell her that you are getting older and while you understand she is worried about (restate what she says) you need the chance to learn while you are at home protected by her and your dad. Make a plan with your parents. An example...  if I close the door you can enter but please knock first. You can check my phone but ask. Don't sneak around and treat me like I did something wrong. \n\nThis is the important part whatever you agree to mean it. If you agree to let her check your phone give it up when she asks without grumbling or getting upset. It will be hard but overtime if she sees that you are not hiding anything trust will build. It will take time maybe months and it can be lost in an instant so be careful. \n\nUnfortunately, the silent treatment is childish and it is just \"proving\" to her that you are not ready for privacy.", "On Android you can set app locks with password on every single app. Or shut the phone off when you sleep and keep the Sim lock on so she can't turn it on.

And I'm going to tell you why, and it will probably upset you.\n\nThere are people on the Internet that want to hurt other people. There just are. Before there was the Internet, they did it in real life, but the Internet gives them access to a lot of people in places where nobody knows how much of a loser they are.\n\nOver the weekend a news story broke. Something horrible happened to a girl about your age. She was chatting with a 28-year-old man on face social media who apparently was pretending to be her age.\n\nThis man, who was a police officer, flew across the country to Riverside, California. He went to her home. He killed her mother and her grandparents, set their home on fire, and kidnapped her.

However, you will never learn how to protect yourself if you don't get a chance to try it out.\n\nYou should be able to chat with people you know with very little oversight. But your mother should still make random inspections of the other things you're doing online. She should help you lock down your social media so that you can enjoy things like Instagram with your friends but not with strangers. And perhaps you can look at TikTok things together.

Please be careful, I've seen plenty of times lack of privacy resulting in a huge strain. Protecting is natural, but it can be very harmful if overdone.", "Again: it\u2019s not abnormal for parents to check on teens social media. How often is she checking now? How often was she checking before?", "At 14 she needs more independence. Her mother is obviously not treating her right with zero privacy. She\u2019s controlling.\n\nThere\u2019s no way she can \u201ckeep her mother out\u201d because she\u2019s up her ass all the time", "No kidding!!!!! It's scary out there frfr", "I agree with that. When I gave my kids their phones they were told that I would be looking through it periodically so that was always the expectation and they don't care. They know if they're not doing anything wrong nothing happens. Perhaps the issue here is that expectation was not set when she got her phone. Transparency makes everything easier.", "Here's the problem with a lot of pervs - they don't advertise that they're creepy. They're terrifyingly good at what they do. Kid believes they're talking to someone about their own age, they have totally normal conversations like any other kid. Except this person \"gets them\" and they have this amazing \"connection\". They somehow always know the right thing to say (spoiler alert, it's always taking their side and telling them how right they are). Then it escalates, one small step at a time. They take a lot of pages from the abuser's playbook. Slowly start isolating them from friends and family, create an emotional dependency, and the kid has no clue there's a problem throughout the process, because they're a trusted friend. By the time it's fully escalated, the kid is so far in the situation they feel like they can't get out and they can never tell anyone. They don't see the problem until it's too late.", "We have a great relationship and they actually have a lot of freedoms like going out with friends. I don't think everything this mother is doing is right but when it comes to phones and the internet I think it should be monitored. My reply was about the phone, not the other restrictions in the post. The open and door and stuff is a bit much.", "before it was like 6-7 times a month but now its almost every day", "Going out with friends is a freedom???? This is really concerning.", "This does seem excessive. What\u2019s her justification?", "Really? Come on now, stop reaching."]}
