If you have and they ignored you, I would ask one of your parents to call the office.  It is unacceptable that you're not allowed to defend yourself.\n\nMany kids who are bullied end up feeling so defeated and excluded that they don't have the confidence to stand up for themselves.  It's a positive thing that you do defend yourself.  \n\nWas your comment mean?  Yes.  Also, she was probably mean to you because she feels insecure about her own appearance.  The unfortunate reality is that bullies often aren't like they are in the movies (the most privileged people).  Bullies are often the people who have been bullied themselves or who have hard lives at home.  This girl looked at you and thought she had found someone weaker, but she couldn't handle that you do have confidence and strength. \n\nAnyway, my point is that your response was appropriate considering what she said to you.  You should be discouraged from standing up for yourself.  Ask your parents to intervene if the school office people won't listen to you.  Good luck.", "NTA She started it, and people who like to say, 'You could have been the bigger person,' have never had their heads slammed into a wall or other such nasty things because the other thought you were being 'uppity.'

He didn\u2019t get bullied much, because he was a kind and genuine person.

Maybe you made a bad case, she should've gotten detention as well.\n\nHowever, next time you see her you got another one: She is not only a penis but also a snitch for running crying to the principal.

She needs to learn that her actions have consequences, and if you can't take it, don't dish it out.", "NTA Your comment was tame I'd have sent them to the dentist.

You probably did hurt her feelings, but so what? Part of growing up (for her) is going to be learning the meaning of the phrase \"don't start nothing, won't be nothing\".\n\nHowever having the moral high ground will never exempt you from consequences. Yes, you were right but you still got punished. Part of being an adult is assessing likely consequences of your actions, and deciding whether it is worth it. Was the satisfaction of the snappy comeback worth the consequences you faced? Only you know the answer to that. Are there other ways to deal with someone like her that won't get you into trouble? Possibly. Depends on how helpful adults in your life are.\n\nYou probably have a lot of adults who are going to talk to you about this from a right & wrong perspective because they feel like they have an obligation to shape who you become. And they aren't wrong per se. But an equally valuable lesson to learn at 15 is to anticipate the consequences of your actions and adjust accordingly.

Honestly I want to look the school up but I only know it was in Pennsylvania in the 30's so not a lot to go on.

I pushed back harder and knocked him on his ass so he cried to a teacher.\n\nThey immediately wanted suspend me for 2 weeks and refused to listen when my mom said that was unacceptable. She dug my deadbeat dad out of hibernation and they both raised hell about the school teaching girls they had to accept violence from boys and not fight back. I never got suspended and he was barred from speaking to me and not allowed to be in the same class through highschool when I moved away.", "Good for you!"]}
