Bullies are often the people who have been bullied themselves or who have hard lives at home.  This girl looked at you and thought she had found someone weaker, but she couldn't handle that you do have confidence and strength. \n\nAnyway, my point is that your response was appropriate considering what she said to you.

Yes, you were right but you still got punished. Part of being an adult is assessing likely consequences of your actions, and deciding whether it is worth it. Was the satisfaction of the snappy comeback worth the consequences you faced? Only you know the answer to that. Are there other ways to deal with someone like her that won't get you into trouble? Possibly. Depends on how helpful adults in your life are.\n\nYou probably have a lot of adults who are going to talk to you about this from a right & wrong perspective because they feel like they have an obligation to shape who you become.

Sorry but no, my kid doesn't get to to be punished when the first to dish it out doesn't. \n\nDon let this stand. If the school wants to punish you, then they need to punish the girl.", "NTA. You can also just not show up to detention as the adults handling this were idiots.", "NTA. She can dish it out but not take it. Accept and enjoy the detention, the world is not fair but as she is a mean person, someone should (and did) stand up to her and give her a bit of what she gives to others.", "Justified AH your comment isnt something to be proud of but she started the interaction by being an AH the response is harsh but fair here", "ESH\n\nShe's an AH for being a bully.\n\nYou're an AH for sinking to her level and mocking her for a medical condition.\n\nYou're both hella insecure for basically the same damn reason: Physical attributes beyond your control that affect your appearance and make you stand out.

Why are we doing... whatever the hell this is? We should be on the same team.\"\n\nThe adults suck, too, for failing to address bullying fairly, and counsel you on the root of the problem.", "NTA. And yeah, your mom needs to pushback **hard** on that. The office's response of \"it doesn't matter\" is the biggest load of horsesh**. Either you both get no detention, or she's right there with you. So you were supposed to just let her call you names and mock you because...?? She's a girl?  I don't understand the reasoning.\n\nAll the NOPE. Don't go quietly with this, I'd refuse to serve one single minute of detention until that was addressed.", "awww she's that selfish and cruel... talk to your parents and make sure they are on your side. I am so sorry that she isnt nice.", "NTA. Horribly unfair.", "Wait, are your parents okay with the school doing that to you?", "NTA, she can't go around mocking others appearances and not expect any return fire.", "ESH- neither of you should have attacked the other's appearance. She started it and is a bigger asshole, but oof you didn't have to hit back quite so hard.", "NTA.\nIf someone bullies or insults a person, and that person reacts to it with a comeback or self-defense, I can almost never see it as asshole behavior, as long as the comeback isn't overly cruel or heinous.\nHuman beings defend themselves, screw this 'wah wah who cares if you're mistreated never fight back, it's wroooong' ideal! Whoever spout that has never been through it. I was bullied for a decade and it wasn't until I bit back that it stopped.\nAction, meet consequences.

NTA", "NTA\n\nHaving your own physical ailment doesn't excuse you from saying nasty shit. That being said, she is also a child like you, so she's still got a lot of learning to do.", "NTA - this is one time I would advocate for a parent to complain.  If you have to do detention for bullying then so should she - she bullied you for your scar, you bullied her for her disease.  Only difference is she's female and you're male.  \n\nThat sounds like they have completely different rules for boys and girls in your school, I'd be contacting the school board about that.", "NTA.  She f\\*\\*\\*ed around and found out.", "LOL someone call the burns unit!! she had ot coming. NTA yo.", "Walk in the next detention and say you're here but you're leaving.  Until she gets punished, you will no longer be serving an uncalled for detention.\n\nNTA", "This is when you get a parent involved to insist that if you get detention, she should too.

She called you a name you called her name.  Both were relating to physical attributes that you have no control over.\n\nSo if you're getting punished she should be as well.  Honestly she should have more than you but that's my opinion.\n\nThis is coming from a mother of a child who due to the dark side of the school district last year has a visible difference that is absolutely noticeable to those around them.\n\nIf somebody teased them or bullied then based on that physical difference and he called them a name back.  And his school tried to place the blame solely on him. \n\nOh, I would reign holy hell on their heads.

I once hit a boy really hard with my skateboard. Which sounds bad, but he deserved it. He was older than me, but I was taller, which seemed to drive him crazy. He was short for his age, and I was always very tall, got to be 6' in the end. Anyway, one day he and his friends ran me down with their bikes while I was on my skateboard. I went flying, got burns from the tires, loads of bruises. So I walked up and whacked him one. Later on his father, who was also short, but a fat guy, rode up on a kid's BXM bike to my house to tell my mom she should punish me or he'd call the cops. My mom BLEW up on him. That his son was older, I was a girl, and younger, and he attacked me. That it wasn't her fault her son was a bully and a coward who could be beat up by a little girl. (While I tried to look small and fragile in the background.) Then she told him to call the cops, go ahead, I'm sure they'd love to hear the story...while another neighbor was quietly pointing out that my dad was a cop (although not a local one.)
