This guy has so much nerve!\n\nThis visitation request sounds ridiculous for a baby and would likely be highly stressful for the grandmother flying with the baby. I honestly think the baby flying is unreasonable unless a parent is flying with them, but even then there are so many people who are constantly mad about babies flying on planes when it isn't a medical necessity.
