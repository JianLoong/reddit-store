Not turn it around/s", "I'm cackling!!!", "Execpt OP did just say no the first time. And betty pushed for OP to come despite them saying no already. At that point betty (who hasnt seen or really talled to OP in almost a year) is just after whatever gift she thinks shes getting from OP and doesnt actually care about the \"friendship\". Plus the golden rule: treat others how you want to be treated. Betty could of 100% brought her own vegetarian meal with her to the bbq so she could hang out and socialize with her friends. Instead she felt that she was morally superior and everyone else was wrong for eating meat. Or at bare minimum she could of asked if there would be vegetarian options. OP is NTA for firing back a hurtful statement betty made previously after being pushed when they said no to the baby shower.", "I agree but people are so absurd. Why say any of this? The first time or the second time? A simple I can\u2019t make it would suffice. People are so petty and exhausting. Is it that hard to just BE A DECENT PERSON?!", "At which point you give the exact same reply.

And true not wrong at all but still quite unnecessary now that baby is already born", "I had a hard time understanding WHAT is supposedly contributing to the destruction of our planet (she's not very clear on it since it's not her real reason) but my best guess would be rampant consumerism & gift-greed.\n\nWhich actually I agree with but I'm still going with ESH on this one myself. Gift-grabs are bad behavior, but digging up her text and feeding it back to her doesn't speak well to OP's character at all. You don't like this person, don't be friends with them; how does attacking them help anyone? Really think you're gonna save the planet?", "You know how much resources a person uses even after death?  Cemeteries take up a crap-ton of space that will never be able to be used again.", "I hear ya on that. I had to reread my own comment to make sure it didn't say that.

Except Anna!! (JK)", "Agreed. Especially as the offensive text wasn't even sent to her, but to someone else. \n\nThere was just no need for OP to insert herself into someone else's argument for the sake of drama. Literally all she had to do was give a polite dismissal - \"Sorry, but I have a prior commitment that day - we'll have to catch up some other time\"."]}
