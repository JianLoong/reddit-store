Those populations make up a small fraction of all humans and still represent a fairly recent, and super disruptive invasive species compared to how the environment existed before.\n\nThis was true long before the concept of capitalism. There is no other animal that takes so much and disrupts as much as humans do or in the way humans do. It's not even close.", "I agree NTA I think it was a pretty player move to use her own medicine against her \ud83e\udd23", "This right here.", "A baby is a big deal.\n\nA party centered around a baby's genitals is not. A gender reveal is literally just that. You're throwing a party to announce their genitals.", "I think OP genuinely feels that way (as per the text doesn't agree with gender reveals), but didn't put in the effort to explain / tailor the response to better fit the gender reveal theme vs. Veganism.\n\nOP could still have used the majority of the text for a coup de grace, but changed it to reflect gender reveal & actual values.\n\nIe., instead of destruction of planet via meat consumption...\n\n OP could have put supports patriarchal gender roles & conservative ideals that will eventually lead to the destruction of the planet. And tell her to Stop pressuring everyone to accept your own POV (*in reference to her protest over BBQ), that poor kid. What is the baby decides they don't want to be the gender you revealed later? Are you (*her/the gender reveal host) going to not show up to the kid's coming out / gender reveal party, because it goes against your own? \n\nIf OP really wants to use that original text, fine, but should do another text elaborating that it's in protest of a gender reveal party and why those are wrong... instead of a protest against not attending a BBQ", "I mean they said they don\u2019t like the idea of gender reveals so they *do* legitimately feel that way. Sure they could have not said this but after a second badgering that was clearly only about gifts, I think it\u2019s warranted", "I think it's the gender reveal party itself. Like a few California fires were from reveals gone wrong. Some parties are outside, make a big mess with confetti and stuff, then don't clean up after themselves. Things like that. Thus, the hurts the environment aspect.", "It's because having kids is inherently damaging to the environment. Instead of just creating one carbon footprint (your own), you create yours plus however many kids you have, plus part of their kids, etc etc etc. Having kids is worse for the environment than eating meat, by a long shot.", "Yes it is\n\nalso pretty idiotic that you said fish", "I only got the invite with the basics of time/place.  She doesn\u2019t know where I live, so she gave it to her dad to give to mine to give to me.  I didn\u2019t even bother to RSVP.", "Jesus Christ, do people really expect you to care enough to have two separate parties for them for this shit? What sort of self-centred bollocks is that.", "Yes, returning a slight with another one is just eye for an eye reasoning.", "i am quite a vengeful person and theres nothing better than being spiteful to someone who deserves it. one of the better parts of life, gives me closure", "Socially, though, you know better than to arrive empty handed. You were taught that grace; you don't need it splashed on an invitation.\n\nPutting something like that on an invite just seems tacky, imo.", "Why? You don\u2019t have to want to join them. But leave them be. If that\u2019s what they enjoy, then I\u2019m happy for them. You sound unbearable. No, actually, you find it unbearable to see other people be happy cause you\u2019re jealous", "And also a lot of damage to the daughters of men (and women!!) who clearly didn\u2019t want them, as the plethora of internet videos has shown us \ud83d\ude2c", "Didn't sound like they were random coworkers. Maybe the girl having the baby shower is someone like myself who doesn't have a ton of close friends or any childhood friends and felt she had a friendship with the op only to be called morally and ethically destructive to the planet. Frankly I think that's the most extra and ridiculous reason to not attend a friend's event I've ever heard. Did Anne just become a hermit bc if she wasn't comfortable being around people who were doing things that she deemed missing and ethically destructive to the planet, she better never leave her house.", "Where are the happy people in this group? Lol", "Demanding food from invited guests is very rude.", "Yep!! \ud83d\ude2c \n\nIt\u2019s honestly a mess.

That makes the whole thing even more pointless. \u201cCome focus on the gender that may or may not be correct for this child!\u201d", "Lol no. Her taking a load from a guy doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to pretend she isn\u2019t harming the planet.", "Then it should be presented as a potluck event and 'please include the dish you intend to bring' with the RSVP so they know what to anticipate from guests vs what the host/hostess will need to supply on their own.\n\nIf I have 9 RSVPs saying veggie tray, I'm not going to buy one.", "Pining for the old \"gender reveal\" where your doctor tells you what it is and then you inform your husband, and possibly your immediate family and a few close friends.", "https://www.overshootday.org/newsroom/country-overshoot-days/\n\nGo to the table and sort by the overshoot day, then see how many countries have \"none\". All of those countries are living within their means. That is not a small fraction at all!\n\nYou are completely ignoring a rich history of Indigenous groups who have lived within the means of the lands they used. You are ignoring that the rise of capitalism is directly tied to a huge jump in human consumption. You are ignoring the racism inherent in overpopulation arguments."]}
