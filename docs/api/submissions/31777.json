Bringing his bf to your party, against your wishes was stepping over a line.\n\nAnd dating a teenager in your mid-40\u2019s is HIGHLY questionable. That in an of itself is already uncomfortable.", "NTA. He asked you whether he could bring him, you said \"No\" and he did it anyway. That's disrespectful, selfish, and thoughtless, especially given that it was \\*your\\* birthday party. And the fact that he's dating one of your school peers ought to make it obvious to him that you might be uncomfortable.

You asked him to come alone and he ignored your request. IMO, it doesn't matter that your dad is attached to a male. He's creepy for having a partner who is 26 years younger than he is. It's even worse because he's with one of your former classmates. If his partner were a young woman, it would be just as bad.\n\nI can't say I would have handled it the way that you did but I definitely wouldn't be happy about his disrespect for you or for his choice of partners.", "Orientation have nothing to do with why this is creepy AF, is he was straight and brought a 19yo girl to your party will be as creepy, your dad is a creep, sorry for what you are going through. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nPeople are looking at your dad a certain way because of his own choices. None of this is your fault.\n\nAsking him not to bring his boyfriend was a healthy request to make. It\u2019s also healthy that your dad choosing not to honor that request comes with consequences for him. \n\nAgain, do not feel guilt or responsible that your dad is being judged and held accountable for his own choices. This is not your fault.", "NTA parents shouldn't prioritize their crotches over their children.", "NTA, you asked your dad not to bring somebody to your party, and he did anyway. Lack of respect on his part, you replied in kind. Regardless of anything else (even though dating a 19 year old while he's in his mid 40s is disturbing), he disregarded your input at your party and basically showed that he would rather you be uncomfortable than have to hide his boyfriend.", "EEEEEEEW. Just NO. I would have been mortified if my father started dating one of my classmates. Major Ick factor. NTA", "NTA and your dad is behaving really inappropriately. Greg is an adult but the age gap is still disturbing. You had every right to tell your father not to bring him around and to throw them out when he did.", "NTA- I think for your 18th birthday you should give your dad a get well soon card because he needs to do better. Setting a boundary isn\u2019t up for negotiation to \u201cregain access\u201d into your life, it\u2019s a requirement.

Your wishes are completely valid here and honestly, your dads sexual orientation has absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nFirst\u2026 you are allowed to invite (or not invite) whoever you wish for YOUR birthday\u2026 he did not respect that. That\u2019s problem number one.\n\nSecond\u2026 that age gap is extremely questionable, regardless of orientation. Of course people are going to talk about it. Very selfish of him to put that on you at all, but especially on YOUR birthday. That\u2019s problem number 2.\n\nThird\u2026 the cradle your father robbed is a person within your social circle. This isn\u2019t some random young guy he brought\u2026 it\u2019s a person that you and your friends actually know and grew up with. Of course, this adds a very explosive dynamic to the attention-grabbing\u2026 on YOUR birthday.\n\nSo yeah, your dad fucked up thrice and you\u2019re well within your right to be pissed and to have had an outburst. He obviously had zero consideration for how his relationship affects you, which is a horrible thing for a parent to do.", "Your dad is a predator that\u2019s why people were looking at him like that, it doesn\u2019t matter the gender of the person dating a person the same age as your child is just wrong, even more so as you are still a teenager and to top it off someone you went to school with.", "Your dad IS a predator", "NTA.  And sorry, but your dad is a predator.  Let's be real, if it was a 45 year old man with a 19 year old girl, people would be losing their shit on his dad.", "No, NTA, you seem to have no problem with him being bi, but him bringing a 19 year old is so cringe, and on purpose.", "being gay has less to do with it. it\u2019s more the 26 year age gap and i get that completely NTA", "NTA. Dad stepped over a set boundary even after explicitly being told not to.", "NTA.\n\nWhatever your dad is dealing with is not your responsibility. You set a reasonable boundary, it's a weird place to have your parent dating one of your peers. Yeah, it's legal, and different strokes, but it would be just as violating if he rolled up with a girl you went to school with. Gender/LGBTQ has nothing to do with it. \n\nGood luck navigating this minefield.

I'm slightly older than your dad and I can tell you that someone that age dating an 18/19 year old is not healthy, for either one. Sure, there's a hair of a chance, enough to say it's not 100% a bad situation; but practically speaking, it's gonna be bad of one flavor or another. \n\nYour dad created the issue. He pushed you into looking like the bad guy, and did it well enough that you're unsure whether you did wrong. You did not. He broke trust. He escalated. \n\nRemember that parents are people, with all the good & bad that entails. I've found that it's good not to see your parents as either good or bad. They're both. Love your dad for any & all reasons to love him; at the same time, don't let any of that lessen any really significant bad elements about them.

No. So that\u2019s on you.

BUT from what you've said in the post you're coming across extremely homophobic. Yes the age gap is creepy af. But did you say it was the age thing? Cause saying I want nothing to do with your relationship or boyfriend and calling his boyfriend weird (when it's your dad that's being weird not Greg). All of that comes across as you being upset about your dad dating a man, not your dad dating a teenager.
