You really need some empathy. Was it ideal to have to listen to that? No I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t but in the long run did it really actually affect you that much? Doubtful. Get over yourself.", "Based on the other parent\u2019s reaction at the event, I think OP has really misunderstood what was going on.  \nNo one was bothered but OP, so I struggle to believe it was that disruptive, first of all.\n\nSecond of all, her husband very recently died.  There was a community fundraiser for his medical bills and funeral expenses.  This community has already rallied around this woman and shown how much they love her!  I am willing to bet the reason she was there is because the community wanted her there.  It was probably a lovely opportunity for the school family to see how she is doing and love on her.\n\nThird of all, something that no one seems to be considering, is that those kiddos just lost their daddy.  How much they literally understand that is minimal, but I PROMISE you they EMOTIONALLY understand it.  They are likely experiencing severe separation anxiety from mom right now.  Everything feels different to them and they don\u2019t know why.

I will be sitting through a ceremony just like this soon.  If I am more worried about my son\u2019s 5 seconds of glory at his graduation than I am about teaching him the importance of extending grace and compassion during difficult times, then I\u2019ve missed the point of parenting.\n\nI understand the knee jerk annoyance, OP.

Much less in the stage with her talking and crying into the microphone\n\nEdit-Typoed my vote", "Yea, it\u2019s likely the teacher had a special connection to the students especially if they showed a lot of family-like support during her personal tragedy. Feel like the OP left this important detail out of the main post to get more support. But I\u2019m leaning to NAH because seems like the teacher made the best of it and the majority of kids didn\u2019t care.", "She had her two young children up on stage for the entire ceremony, running around, on top of her holding the one while giving a speech. Who was watching the other kid why she was doing this, by the way? How large was this class? Because some ceremonies are fucking enormous.\n\nIf she was holding a baby for an extended period of time, next to a loud microphone / sound equipment, in a loud and bright environment for a long ass time, then she's TA because that's irresponsible point blank. \n\nIf there was truly no one around who would take over reading the names so she could parent her two young kids, then sure, OP's TA. Not that we could know that or anything but whatever. \n\nOP's allowed to her feelings. She watched her kid graduate, a one-time deal for the kid. She didn't verbally attack the teacher or degrade her online for this. She just thought that she made a bad judgment call and expressed that to other parents to see if they thought the same, and then dropped it after. I'm not sure how that makes her an asshole.", "Wow, that\u2019s despicable. Her husband just died, she\u2019s now raising 2 young children on a teacher\u2019s salary, and you think she\u2019s doing this for attention? You\u2019re not wrong about what you said about yourself.", "No \u201cmaybe\u201d about it - that makes you as big an AH as OP", "She wouldn\u2019t have been talking/trying to talk into the microphone", "YTA actually lol", "Even if that is true (weak evidence at best for this) it still does not constitute a \"pick me.\" It would be maybe Main Character Syndrome. A \"pick me\" is when a girl is \"Not Like Other Girls\" as an example. The term has no application to this scenario. I don't see how having her child on stage would be about trying to win the approval of men.", "or she has no one to watch her kids because her husband recently died? do you have any sort of heart?", "I\u2019d like to know if the students wanted her on the stage. Maybe with the teacher losing her husband the students wanted her there so they can support her while she supported them. \n\nIt really feels like it\u2019s one person who was upset/annoyed by this and to me that gives the impression that the teacher is beloved and everyone else just really wanted her involved. \n\nNow imagine how OP would react if she left her child on the side of the stage and the child cried the whole time. The teacher wasn\u2019t going to win with OP unless they just stayed home alone crying", "Some schools require all the teachers to attend, I am just surprised another teacher didn't step up to help. Or family, friends etc..", "To project I would have to have went through it and since I married the mother of my son 12 years ago and we are still together I can say I haven\u2019t. As to you saying that it\u2019s by choice or danger that\u2019s just not true. Most dads have to fight for months or years after a divorce or separation to see their kids because every state defaults to the mother and most child custody cases have TPO that are found to be baseless thrown out that keep the kids from the dad. Not to mention the dozens of other tactics that most moms do in custody cases. This is proven by court case after court case.", "Definitely NAH as long as OP drops it \u2026 if they hold onto this when no one seems bothered then they will move into AH territory", "This woman has zero friends, zero family that could have watched her kids for an hour on the weekend? She couldn\u2019t have just asked the vice principal or whoever to read the names (no one has an answer to that one)? I wish I lived in your naive world.", "So it wouldn't have guaranteed that she didn't make any noise. It really seems like you're upset that the moment wasn't exactly how you pictured it in your head.  As much as that sucks sometimes, there wasn't a deliberate attempt on the part of this lady to ruin anything.  You're overreacting.", "Thanks, I\u2019ll consult the DSM 5 before I comment on a Reddit thread next time", "Honestly that makes it even worse. Look at me my husband is dead and my babies are crying!", "There are no laws in the US that default to the mother in terms of custody. They do what is in the best interest of the child, and any good judge will try to give equal custody, where appropriate. Yes, there are women who lie in court. There are plenty of men who lie in court as well. \n\nI know several men who have gotten either full or partial custody of their kids in a divorce.", "And you do realise that someone else reading the names wouldn\u2019t have automatically meant the child would have been quiet, right?", ">She couldn\u2019t have just asked the vice principal or whoever to read the names (no one has an answer to that one)?\n\nMaybe she\u2019s primarily a teacher to seniors and thus has these students currently. Maybe she\u2019s a teacher who teaches over all 4 years and there is a bond. When my eldest graduated 4 years ago, the teachers who read names fit these criteria. They weren\u2019t just randomly chosen.", "Or maybe she has no family nearby and her friends are busy or uncomfortable watching a 4 month old. And high school graduations do not only last an hour for faculty.\n\nAnd again, maybe the teacher had no choice in what part of the ceremony they conducted and they did ask and were denied. Schools are putting some teachers in impossible positions. That\u2019s why some of them are quitting.\n\nMaybe instead of being naive, I\u2019m thinking of other realistic situations. Not everything works out perfectly all the time, and you have to make do with a really shitty situation.", "I\u2019m a widow with three very young children, I have no family close and no one I trust to leave my children with close to me. So please don\u2019t just assume everyone has a person readily available to watch their children. My anxiety skyrocketed after my husbands accident and there\u2019s few people I can comfortably leave my children with and they\u2019re all a long drive away, and yes since it\u2019s Reddit I\u2019ll clarify, I\u2019m actively in therapy and on medication to work on my anxiety.", "Good bait", "Really it\u2019s so easy to prove that most states default to the mom.

This process is typically initiated by establishing paternity in court. Paternity can be established in different ways and different states have various ways that this can be accomplished. One way is to publicly acknowledge paternity. The father may have signed acknowledgment of paternity when the child was born. The father may take a DNA test to establish paternity. Some states will consider a father to have the same legal rights as a mother when his name is on the birth certificate.", "You\u2019re also cherry-picking evidence to suit your narrative. If you look up whether or not custody cases in the US favor the mom, every single one will tell you there are no laws that do. Keep grasping at straws though."]}
