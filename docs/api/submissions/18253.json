Maybe the teacher wanted to hold onto a glimmer of positivity and celebration during a really shitty time, and the only way for her to do that was to have children with her.\n\nSure, someone else could have read the names (assuming it was up to the teacher). But my time in the school board has shown me that high school kids can be immensely kind and wholesome, and my bet is that they WANTED this teacher to be an active part of their celebration.

Nobody is going to look back thirty years from now and comment....\"do you remember when that little girl ruined our graduation????\"\n\nChances are, the whole ceremony will be forgotten by everybody (students, family of students, faculty) within just a few months.

You really need some empathy. Was it ideal to have to listen to that? No I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t but in the long run did it really actually affect you that much? Doubtful. Get over yourself.", "Based on the other parent\u2019s reaction at the event, I think OP has really misunderstood what was going on.  \nNo one was bothered but OP, so I struggle to believe it was that disruptive, first of all.\n\nSecond of all, her husband very recently died.  There was a community fundraiser for his medical bills and funeral expenses.  This community has already rallied around this woman and shown how much they love her!  I am willing to bet the reason she was there is because the community wanted her there.  It was probably a lovely opportunity for the school family to see how she is doing and love on her.\n\nThird of all, something that no one seems to be considering, is that those kiddos just lost their daddy.  How much they literally understand that is minimal, but I PROMISE you they EMOTIONALLY understand it.  They are likely experiencing severe separation anxiety from mom right now.  Everything feels different to them and they don\u2019t know why.  I feel like it\u2019s entirely possible that she is choosing to limit the time they have to be away from her right now, even if she COULD find child care.\n\nMy son is graduating from high school on June 10th.  I will be sitting through a ceremony just like this soon.  If I am more worried about my son\u2019s 5 seconds of glory at his graduation than I am about teaching him the importance of extending grace and compassion during difficult times, then I\u2019ve missed the point of parenting.\n\nI understand the knee jerk annoyance, OP.
