Get over yourself.", "Based on the other parent\u2019s reaction at the event, I think OP has really misunderstood what was going on.  \nNo one was bothered but OP, so I struggle to believe it was that disruptive, first of all.\n\nSecond of all, her husband very recently died.  There was a community fundraiser for his medical bills and funeral expenses.  This community has already rallied around this woman and shown how much they love her!  I am willing to bet the reason she was there is because the community wanted her there.  It was probably a lovely opportunity for the school family to see how she is doing and love on her.\n\nThird of all, something that no one seems to be considering, is that those kiddos just lost their daddy.  How much they literally understand that is minimal, but I PROMISE you they EMOTIONALLY understand it.  They are likely experiencing severe separation anxiety from mom right now.  Everything feels different to them and they don\u2019t know why.

It's not a leavers situation. A They are awarded their high school diploma. It's handed to them by a teacher or principal when they walk across the stage and have their name announced. (It's pretty similar to a UK university graduation.) The diploma is the qualification we receive. high school diploma is a standard requirement for most jobs and for higher education opportunities.\n\nWe don't have national state-run exams like GCSEs. (There's state-level academic testing, but that's separate from diplomas and are instead primarily used to measure the quality of the school.) While there are additional exams that are available nationally, these are to help students for university/college (these are used synonymous in the US). The SATs and ACTs are admissions tests that play a role in getting into university, but these are run by private companies and not the government. There's also Advanced Placement (AP) subject exams, but these are so high school courses can serve as college credit. There's even some International Baccalaureate programs, but that's its own separate thing, and IB Diploma students are also high school graduates.\n\nKeeping this in mind, high school graduations are a big deal. We're in the middle of high school graduation season, so we're seeing lots of posts about family conflicts related to graduation. Under normal circumstances, teachers wouldn't have their children on stage with them. As these are big family events, there's usually loads of kids of all ages present, but only in the audience. Graduation ceremonies can last hours due to speeches and how many students are receiving diplomas. It is not uncommon for small children present to lose it, but they're only in the audience. However, given that this teacher tragically lost her husband very recently and the wider community has embraced and supported her and her children, the vast majority of people were very understanding and willing to excuse it. It sounds like the original plan was for the other teachers to take both children while the teacher handed out diplomas, but the toddler wasn't having it. Again, the vast majority understood the situation and supported the teacher in doing what was necessary.\n\nETA: Graduations for younger kids, like from preschool, kindergarten, and any grade before 12th grade, are basically only ceremonial. It's to celebrate the achievement of students over the past year and usher them into the next grade. Families often enjoy these, especially when little kids hit milestones and they're reminded their kids are growing up. It varies widely throughout the country and comes down to what each individual school decides to do. Some schools do this for every grade while others only mark moving on from elementary school or middle/junior high school. Plenty of schools don't do any such grade-level graduations.", "graduation isn\u2019t about the teachers, it\u2019s about the class. if she REALLY had to be there, then the school could have arranged some type of free childcare for her for those few hours. sounds like her job should support her more in tough times.", "Yeah, you don\u2019t get paid for this crap either.

A lot of students dream of walking across that stage but having their name called out followed or even interrupted by \"abwausiaaee\" or whatever unintelligible babbling the young child made doesn't exactly fit that dream scenario. A lot of people also find that irritating or annoying to hear in a general audience who aren't there to listen to that. Parents also look forward to that moment of seeing their child graduate. Especially when it's something they didn't do themselves, or may even been looking forward to it. Most if not all of these kids were also students durring COVID times. When education was harder to adapt to virtually and everyone, parents, students, and teachers had to work extra hard to figure out to cope with the new normal during that time period. Making walking the stage possibly matter a bit more than usual to this generation and their parents. \n\nAs for your homeroom teacher part. The hard truth is most kids aren't going to get their name read out by a teacher that they admire. For two reasons. The first is that every student learns differently. That means that even great teachers are not going to teach in a style that works for every student. On top of that think about how many teachers you can across in your public school education? Tons right? A fair bit over a dozen once you factor in the fact that high schools often have teaches dedicated to spesific courses. Now how many really stand out to you? Statistically on average kids respond that they found that only 5 teachers made a strong impact on them in their entire public school life. That's less than a 50% chance that any given student in her class had the kind of bond with her that you felt with your senior year homeroom teacher.\n\n Making it statistically more likely that more people would care more about the experience of graduating without reguarly disruption than having strong feelings about who actually is reading their name.

Since we are all kinds of people, with all kinds of family and all kinds of needs, you start to understand the needs of others a lot clearer.

Sometimes the lecturer had to hold a baby, or leave the room for a bit, while educating us.  I remember very clearly one of the students saying, \"It's alright. You have kids. We have time. Your kids are the most important, you take care of them. We can wait.\" And that person was \"thumbs upped\" by nearly EVERY student.

But no one ever shoots us at school, so I guess it's less traumatic here.", "What a joke. Her husband died so of course people want to make this as normal as possible from her. Excluding her would be kicking her when she\u2019s down", "My opinion changed in a SNAP when I came upon the word widow. \n\n\u2018Well known in the community\u2019 means it\u2019s a small or tight knit area and if no one else is complaining, I bet they know she most likely doesn\u2019t have anyone to help, regardless of why she became a single mom. I doubt the teacher brought her kids to the graduation- onto the the stage!- bc she wanted the attention on her own children. \n\nThere\u2019s a decent chance she fretted over it before hand was was probably dying inside from grief and embarrassment but carried on for her students. \n\nAny other teacher could have stepped up and read the names too, right? Any faculty member, really. Sounds to me like it truly wasn\u2019t a big deal to most folks if no one intervened. ESH except the teacher  if it WAS a problem and still nobody did anything to minimize the fuss.", "Yeah but even if the woman was \"just\" recently single, rather than widowed, she would be entitled to a grace period. Like if her husband had run off with an affair partner and left her to raise two young kids I'd still let her bring them anywhere. Recently single is traumatic too. OP is a selfish, uncaring AH.", "I felt the exact same way. At first, I was leaning N A H because the teacher was doing her best, but it was understandably frustrating or distracting. \n\nImmediately seeing this top comment and OPs complete lack of sympathy or self awareness tosses her directly in the YTA pile.", "It\u2019s really not that important of an event.  You basically need to have a pulse to graduate.", "Agreed. Op will go down in AITA history as one of the all time top 10.", "The teachers husband died 4-5 months ago when the teacher was either pregnant or just had the baby. The whole community had a fundraiser for the teacher and kids. \n\nOP is the AH sounds like everybody wanted the teacher there.", "I've attended 5 graduations as a guest and honestly, as a child-free person, a baby might actually make it interesting.", "This is why you were top 100.\n\nMany think it\u2019s just studying that puts you there. It isn\u2019t. Having the social emotional learning skills to balance your time, reason and critically think like this is so important.", "Yea screw her! How dare her husband just up and die around graduation, staining the moment for eternity.... /s", "Your children at graduation is also not unprofessional. When the fuck did people lose any sense of community and empathy. If you think walking across a stage is more important than the teacher trying to get by with what she\u2019s going through, you\u2019re incredibly selfish.", "It\u2019s like when people say ex partner/spouse when it\u2019s really LATE partner/spouse. You wouldn\u2019t say ex mother when someone\u2019s mom dies. Why is a partner different?", "\u201cRecently single\u201d has got to be the worst euphemism ever for \u201crecently widowed\u201d. It\u2019s technically true, but holy crap- it\u2019s really offensive. So yeah, there\u2019s a huge difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt explains a lot about why she would choose to hold her daughter instead of leaving her w/ someone else. Thinking about what her child is going through- she\u2019s too little to understand why her dad hasn\u2019t been around lately, but surely she picks up on everyone else\u2019s emotional states. So scary, and so confusing!  HUGE difference between this situation and a single mom who couldn\u2019t get a babysitter. And it takes the OP from being sort of an asshole to a mega-super-colossal-asshole.", "There must\u2019ve been at least a hundred parents in the audience - if this was such a big deal could none of them have taken turns to hold/entertain these kids until their own child\u2019s turn on stage or chipped in to find a sitter knowing the mother was struggling? The lack of (active) community support is almost as bad as OP\u2019s lack of compassion, especially if nobody thought to ask if help was needed until they all turned up on the day. YTA with a side of ESH for the other adults in the area.", "Good grammar is the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you're shit.", "This", "Yeah, how very \u201cevil stepmother from fleabag\u201d of them", "Not just the woman, but the kids too. They may not be ready for a babysitter, and that is OK.  The school is the AH here for making her come to graduation.", "But what if the situation is that the mom is recently single because the mom got them out of an abusive situation.   Or abandonment? Is that less traumatic for the child and magically creates a support system?\n\nOP is YTA regardless of the circumstances.", "Precisely, Dick.", "But she's probably the one most people in the audience actually wanted to see.", "You do know the teacher is usually selected ahead of time and practices the names, right?", "maybe. maybe not. \nthese are empty assumptions.", "This. So much this."]}
