Your sister agreed to those initially and is now changing her mind based on the situation. Why can't she just get a sitter for the night? Also your mom taking her side and saying she's going to back out is an attempt to strong arm you to cave and it is beyond petty.  \n\n\nDon't back down OP. It's your day and you wanted it to be a child free experience. Don't let your sister and her drama get you down", "NTA.\n\nShe knew no kids, she expected you to cater to her and for you to change your mind. It's your wedding not Jen's. She can not go or find a babysitter.", "NTA but mom is being super weird.", "NTA. Plain and simple.\nYou're right about the world not going to cater to your sister. If the mom sides with her, you'll just have to accept that decision and have your big day and enjoy it regardless of anything.", "NTA.  It's OP's call and they were understanding that Jen might not be able to make.  Making an exception for her opens up the floodgates of people angry they didn't get one.", "NTA\n\nYou said no kids. She agreed to no kids. She has bothered you again about the kids. You still say no kids. If she wants to come, she should find a babysitter. \n\nAlso, why is your mom getting involved? I don't see why this concerns her. This seems like a you and Jen problem.", "NTA........... \n I have never understood how and why parents chose sides instead of trying to find neutral ground.", "NTA. I don't blame you for not wanting kids at your wedding, they're a distraction and can take attention away from what is supposed to be *your* day.\n\nHowever, it is your mother escalating the situation, not your sister, so don't take it out on Jen. Your mother needs to realize that it's your wedding, your decision, and in the end, she's only going to regret missing her child's wedding if she skips because of this.\n\nAlso, if the wedding is a few weeks away, there's still enough time that Jen could potentially find some other solution, so if you both want her to be at your wedding, maybe help her figure something out.", "First and foremost, it's you're wedding. You can decide who can and cannot attend, and what conditions and rules all guests must follow. That includes not allowing any children. This has long been established as acceptable behavior for the bride and groom.\n\nJen cannot expect you to cater to her and her daughter just because the arrangements she made fell through. It sucks, but the world does not revolve around her. If you allow her to bring her daughter, and that privilege was not extended to your other guests with children, it will look bad on you both, because presumably everyone else will have paid a babysitter or other arrangements for their children so they could attend.\n\nAlso, to all the people saying you're in the wrong, I don't see any of THEM stepping up to babysit Jen's daughter? I don't see any of them volunteering any ideas. They need to get off their soapbox unless they're willing to put their money where their mouths are.\n\nNTA OP. You're wedding, your rules. A 10 month old will 100% interrupt and disturb your ceremony.", "INFO: what was Jen\u2019s childcare plan and why did it fall through?", "NTA\n\nYou gave her plenty of notice\u2026 and the wedding is still a few weeks out? I mean I understand not wanting to leave your baby alone with a stranger, but what does she do while at work? Why is that not a viable option?\n\nMy thought (and I could be wrong) is that your sister was hoping you would change your mind and didn\u2019t have a plan to begin with. \n\nYou are not selfish for wanting your boundaries to be respected.", "NTA   \n\n\nyour wedding, your choice. you didn't do anything disrespectful, you held a boundary, something that pisses a lot of controlling people off lmao", "NTA, its your event, you can make the rules. Sure, its sad that her childcare fell through or something, but it is what it is. Its not the end of the world.", "NTA\n\nIt's increasingly more common to have a child free wedding. This is your wedding. If they can't respect the no child rule, then they are the problem, not you.", "NTA \nbut I\u2019d go as far to say mom is. \n\nDoes Jen not have a friend, family who can watch the baby? So her original plan fell through, not your problem. \n\nI never understood people who won\u2019t go anywhere without their child. Who wouldn\u2019t want a night out without \nchild care duties?  \n\nYour SS is going to literally sit at your wedding with an infant in her lap! At 10 months, even if this baby is walking, your SS is just going to follow her around while she roams? Sounds like a great night huh? \n\nJen can come to the ceremony, go check on her D, then spend a few hours at the reception. If she wants to leave early she can. \n\nYour moms stance is ridiculous. Why is it so important to cater to Jen? She\u2019d rather skip her one daughters wedding to do what? Sit at home with her other D to make what statement exactly? That she likes Jen better? That her grandchild is more important? That it\u2019s unfair to leave an infant out of a wedding that said infant is never even going to care about?", "NTA. No means no. This is your wedding, everyone else\u2019s opinions literally mean nothing.", "NTA but I always tell people I\u2019m coming given the babysitter shows and there are no issues. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to find a reliable sitter, even weeks out.", "NTA and not just because it's your wedding and your choice, but also because making one exception would bring resentment from all the others who have made arrangments to let their kids home, this is an entitled move from your half sister", "INFO: is Jen a single mother?\n\n(My vote is NTA, because is your wedding, so it's your desision.)", "NAH - you are free to have a child-free wedding but don't expect everyone to be on board and cater to your wishes. If others don't want to come because of it, that's their right and you have to accept that.\n\nMaking an exception for her is basically telling everyone else with kids that *their* kids aren't good enough but your sister's is and slapping them in the face. So it should be all or nothing.", "NAH, well maybe mom. I do personally think that people should consider siblings children different than others. If you are getting married in a church, do they have a quiet room? Ours has a room separated by multipane glass that allows you to let your kids roam and be restless while not disturbing others.", "INFO Did her fianc\u00e9 pass away recently?", "Nta. Child free includes babies and once you make an exception for one you have to make it for others.", "NAH, as always with these wedding posts. You can have, do, invite, at your whim. And everyone else can submit to your decision and attend or not, as they desire. It only becomes an asshole situation when the parties involved don\u2019t respect the decisions and complain about any fallout that results. Maybe it\u2019s my culture but I have never been to any wedding that involved restrictions. Kids, the crazy uncle, the aunt that didn\u2019t have a filter, the cousin that was always in trouble. Plus ones were not limited any conditions either. All were memorable events that included all the human drama that come with these events, and all were celebrations.", "NTA. Rules are rules.  Jen can make other arrangements or not attend.", "Read the title and immediately knew NTA. And now reading the whole thing still NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and its your decision", "ESH, and by everyone I mean you and your mom. \n\nYou're entirely in the right to have a child-free wedding, and you made that expectation super clear, so no issues with that. But the way you talk about Jen's decision like it's her fault she has a kid and plans fell through...it's not a good vibe. Obviously yes, you're within a \"reddit-legalese\" technical right of not being an A H, but is this really the hill you want to die on? Is it really worth damaging your relationship with your sister and potentially other family members just so that you can be right? It seems like there are certainly compromises possible here and you're just trying to save face for your own pride. If others were to complain about it, there are any number of responses: \"It's my wedding, shut up...I made an exception for family with extenuating circumstances...etc\"\n\nYour mother is absolutely adding to this drama and it's incredibly petty for her to insist on not coming because Jen can't. If mom cares so much about Jen attending, she could babysit the kid so at least one of them to attend. Mom's the biggest A H here, but you really need to stop thinking about who's \"right\" and think about what you actually want your wedding and your relationship with your family to be like going forward.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding.  Your rules.  Jen has had enough time to arrange childcare.  If the original plan fell through, she can make another plan.  Surely there is more than 1 babysitter in the world.", "NTA. Your decision is not unreasonable. You've given your sister more than enough time to make arrangements. Her expectations are ridiculous.", "As other's have said you've made the decision to not allow your sister to bring her child to your wedding and this is the result. Its your wedding and if you dont want to accommodate your sister thats your choice- you dont even have to invite her if you don't want her there. You just have to deal with the consequences.  I don't agree with the one rule for all argument, a guest would have to be incredibly petty to think they are more important than such a close family member. If I were you rather than being so rigid, I'd look for a compromise - perhaps she could at least come to the ceremony and sit with the baby at the back. There is a compromise to be had, be the bigger person and find it !", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t really call Jen one either tbh, her plans changed and she confirmed with you that your decision was firm. Your mother on the other hand\u2026 oh boy. AH-alert!", "So you don\u2019t want you niece at the wedding? Hardly like she is any random child. YTA", "NTA a few years back, I went to a wedding, of a close acquaintance. There was a baby crying all through the ceremony! ...because, the baby's mother didn't want to miss their vows. On the video, the only thing you hear is a baby wailing. No vows, could be heard, over the baby!", ">she said if that's the case then she doesn't think she can make it... \n\nYTA for saying \"she doesn't get to act all huffy and think the world needs to cater to her.\"\n\nJen accepted your decision.  Your mother is the one complaining.  And both of them get to make their own decisions about attending or not.  That's the risk you run when a wedding has conditions like childfree/destination/dry or whatever.", "NTA. You have been consistent with the no one under 18 rule. Just continue on as if your mother isn't going to be at the wedding. This day is about you and not your mother so you get to make the rules and enjoy your day the way you and your fiancee would like.", "I\u2019m going with YTA because you seem to be leaving something big out. You say in a comment the fianc\u00e9 was supposed to watch the baby so Jen could attend, but you won\u2019t answer any question around why the fianc\u00e9 is no longer able to watch the baby. If the fianc\u00e9 is in the hospital or, god forbid, dead, then you are 100% TA in this situation. If you decide to explain why the fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t watch any more, I\u2019m happy to change my vote.", "INFO:  why can\u2019t Jen find anyone else to watch the baby?  I need the reasoning before making a decision.", "Against the grain but YTA. I mainly just don't agree with the bride and groom being the ultimate rulers of the whole day. She tried to find childcare, she couldn't. She still wants to come. According to the current rules of weddings, yes of course you can forbid children from attending, but it's a bummer. Your sister will miss now. Maybe one day you'll understand her point of view, maybe you never will, maybe this is your sister getting her way on your wedding day. But...meh. You're marrying the love of your life. It'll be perfect no matter what happens, and ya know, the more the merrier.", "Nta. Really the only asshole here in my opinion is your mom. \n\nJen asked, and then she asked again- but when you said no, she didn\u2019t pick a fight with you. Your mom did that. \nThis is an important day for you. It should be important to her, she should want to be there. Even just threatening not to come over something like this would be incredibly hurtful.", "NTA, but your mom is.", "YTA, don't get all huffy because people make their own decisions and won't cater to your demands.", ">I understand if Jen doesn't want to come but she doesn't get to act all huffy and think the world needs to cater to her,\n\nCharacterizing her situation as \"not wanting to come\" is uh... entirely unreasonable to the extent that I want to vote Y T A regardless. Yeah, you're entitled to not have kids at your wedding, but you *literally* just wrote \n\n>she'd still like to attend my wedding\n\nSo why are you saying \"if she doesn't want to come\" ?????? She *does* want to come but *cannot* unless she can bring the baby. And like, she gets to be disappointed that she can't come to your wedding, and she gets to be disappointed that you'd prefer no baby and no half-sister over having your half-sister there at the cost of her bringing her baby. You're within your rights to have that preference, but she's not an AH for being disappointed about it. \n\nBut really, the fact that you say \"Jen doesn't want to come\" as if it's her decision and not 100% your decision that she's not there is absurd enough to cement my YTA. I was gonna say N A H but nope, that's just too whack.", "NTA", "NTA, your wedding, your decision.

At best a peacekeeper who will try to force you to do her will in order to keep the peace.Or, she just prefers Jen. \n\nSad situation but now you know what to expect from them and how to respond.  People who don\u2019t respect boundaries don\u2019t change.  \n\n However, I don\u2019t think this was the hill to die on.  You could have said no babies for the ceremony.  But, then I think all brides who want a Disney princess, I am so special kinda day are obnoxious.  This prevalent attitude ruins relationships.   It shows that one day your way is more important than a lifetime of family and friendship.  \n\nWhatever happens now expect turmoil with them long term.", "NTA\nIf you said what you claim, you told them to respect your wedding, not get huffy and might've brought up the fact that your mom is choosing your sister's feelings over your wedding.

I prefer family if they are able to and I do not trust nanny/babysitting companies, thanks internet. I hate when the family makes child free plans together, not the only members with kids but do have the youngest, because our babysitters will be in attendance. Info not beg and plead not make a scene or throw a tantrum to get my kids invited. We made the decision to have kids and we are responsible for them and their care. One of us ends up missing the event while the other stays with the kids. They are entering their teens so this is not a long term issue to us. \n\nAnd for those currently childless people reading this PLEASE take think about all the issues, both good and bad, that come along with having kids.

My coworker has no right to complain about my child free wedding if I let my sister bring her baby.

People use \"entitled\" as a negative when they're talking about people acting entitled to things which they really aren't. But being entitled to something is value neutral in its most literal sense.

That baby will almost certainly interrupt the ceremony which is clearly what OP is trying to avoid by making their wedding child-free. If Jen cannot respect that, then they don't go. It's as simple as that. If the mother and Jen are willing to die on the hill that the niece goes, then that's their problem, not OP's. They've known for MONTHS that they can't go.", "There\u2019s a reason they want no kids at the wedding.

Jen asked the first time to make sure the rule applied to her because many couples provide exceptions for immediate family members. She asked the second time because her child care fell through and she didn\u2019t think she had time to make new arrangements. Both instances are very reasonable. Also, let\u2019s be real here: most people in OP\u2019s shoes would choose not to die on this hill and let their sibling bring their baby and they would do so not because they\u2019re pushovers but because they value family over their perfect day. I\u2019m not saying OP is an AH for enforcing this rule but I don\u2019t think Jen is an AH for hoping her sibling would make an exception for her.", "You realize this is OP\u2019s sister and niece right?

As for OP\u2019s mom, if she doesn\u2019t agree with the decision, she doesn\u2019t have to support it. That\u2019s the thing about making decisions: you\u2019re free to make the choice but you\u2019re not free from the consequences.", "Kids interrupting cermonys make beautiful memories.", "No, it wouldn\u2019t.  Whatever concerns the couple has about children attending the wedding can be easily mitigated because they\u2019re super close with the children\u2019s parents.", "Choosing to be the bigger person is never an obligation, and technically I don't think you can be called an A H for not going above and beyond...but it's also not a way I'd recommend living your life", "She seems to not want to answer that and I wonder if it\u2019s critical to this story\u2026.", "She obviously was fine with her baby not being allowed for she did make arrangements. However they fell through and thats not on op. There still time for Jen to figure out other plans. She the one choosing not to figure it out. She can be upset that her plans fell through but she knew ahead of time.", "Expecting an exception to the rules on the basis of being family is what's called entitement. She asked TWICE despite knowing OP's stance each time, and that's the problem. I don't think it's reasonable to even be asking. OP is entitled to a perfect day, because IT'S THEIR DAY. It's THEIR WEDDING. Not their sister's, not their mother's, it's OP's. They're paying for it, so they get to decide the rules. And it's a VERY VERY simple rule: No kids.", "That\u2019s the point. They\u2019re not the same FOR YOU. It\u2019s clearly different for their wedding.", "Again, making an exception on the basis of \"family\" is not fair to the other guests. Sure, OP can make an exception, it's their wedding after all, but they'll have to deal with the baby inevitably interrupting the ceremony. My whole point is OP made the wedding child-free to avoid the problem of them interrupting the ceremony, and having an exception will go against how they want their wedding to play out.", "That\u2019s like having an alcohol free party but allowing certain people to bring alcohol. This is the dumbest logic. No kids means no kids. Period. 99% of the comments understands this.", "100%. I\u2019m guessing the fianc\u00e9 is hospitalized or has recently passed (I\u2019ve unfortunately seen stories like that on this sub). If that\u2019s the case, it makes her the major AH", "> However they fell through\n\nRight, and thus she cannot attend without the baby, which is not allowed. This is semantic as fuck. \n\n>She the one choosing not to figure it out. \n\nYou don't know what she's choosing. Respect her as an adult enough to believe her when she says that her childcare options are exhausted. Acting like you know she could do more to get childcare when you have no idea what she's tried and what her options are is unreasonable.", "So OP will get to have their perfect day but it\u2019s going to be without their mom and sister. I hope it\u2019s worth it to them. If any member of my family  wasn\u2019t present at my wedding, it wouldn\u2019t be perfect. OP feels differently and that\u2019s ok. However OP can\u2019t blame their mom for putting a damper on the day because they\u2019re still getting their wish: a child free wedding.", "Lmao yeah I guess you\u2019re right. I tend to be closer to my actual family than my husbands coworkers.  I guess you don\u2019t have a difference in relationships so good for you!", "So OP will get their child free wedding but their  mother and sister won\u2019t be there. No one is stopping OP from having the wedding they want.", "It\u2019s not the same thing. Not every parent has the luxury of reliable child care so if they can\u2019t bring your kids to an event, they can\u2019t go. Most couples might be disappointed if their friends can\u2019t attend their wedding for that reason but it would be unacceptable to them if their sibling couldn\u2019t attend. That\u2019s why many couples are willing to make the exception.", "OMG my brain didn\u2019t even go there but I think you may be on to something. \n\nShe clearly doesn\u2019t want to explain the \u201clong story\u201d of why childcare is an issue.", "Yes she cant attend a child free event. Welcome to being a parent. She isnt the only parent that got invited. Its not fair to allow one to bring their child and the rest are out of luck. There could be others that aren\u2019t attending for the same reason. \n\nPlans fall through with babysitters. You got to accept that as a parent. Does it suck yes but thats life as a parent.", "It's still a childfree wedding. And OP already said no, OP and their SO are not assholes to want to have a day without screaming children/babys.\nThe sister can be upset, but that's it. She's not an AH for asking and being upset, the mother is another story.", "Not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with different levels but it\u2019s not fair to compare how you\u2019d do things compared to other people and I shouldn\u2019t compare mine either. I disagree agree with how some people do their weddings but I have to look at it from a neutral point. And you can still be close to family and have a hard set rule and for a lot of people kids aren\u2019t ideal for certain situations or events. Especially if the couple isn\u2019t fond of kids.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I understand your reasoning. I understand a lot of people would make exceptions. But this is a one time very important event for them which is why I don\u2019t thing it\u2019s a problem they do it the way they want regardless of who may have a problem with it. It may not be ideal for the sister but then if they cater then it\u2019s not ideal for to OP and because it\u2019s their wedding they get priority. If it was more of a neutral event I would have a different opinion.", "> Its not fair to allow one to bring their child and the rest are out of luck.\n\nYeah, no shit. But the parent who can't come still has every right in the world to be disappointed.", "Most normal people would and do make exceptions for actual close family members.", "> OP and their SO are not assholes to want to have a day without screaming children/babys.\n\nI never disagreed with that, I feel like you are just assuming that I'm saying things I'm not saying.", "Of course. However i would never drag my parents in to it. I would encourage my mom to go. Its not unfair treatment not to being to go due to childcare."]}
