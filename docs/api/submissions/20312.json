Again, I told her (politely) no, and she said if that's the case then she doesn't think she can make it. I said I understood, but I could see Jen was really upset.\n\nMom got involved and said I'm being selfish, and should allow Jen to bring her baby so she can attend at least part of the ceremony. She's saying she won't attend either and would rather stay with Jen.\n\nI eventually snapped and said they both need to respect my decision, I understand if Jen doesn't want to come but she doesn't get to act all huffy and think the world needs to cater to her, and mom is willing to miss the biggest day of my life because of all this.\n\nNeedless to say it's been pretty tense between me and Jen.

Your sister agreed to those initially and is now changing her mind based on the situation. Why can't she just get a sitter for the night? Also your mom taking her side and saying she's going to back out is an attempt to strong arm you to cave and it is beyond petty.\n\nDon't back down OP. It's your day and you wanted it to be a child free experience. Don't let your sister and her drama get you down\n\nEdit:OP is definitely the asshole. She purposefully left out the fact that the child's father died in a car crash and that her sister and mom are justified in being pissed at her insensitivity", "NTA.\n\nShe knew no kids, she expected you to cater to her and for you to change your mind. It's your wedding not Jen's. She can not go or find a babysitter.", "NTA but mom is being super weird.", "YTA. Plain and simple.\n\nEdited and corrected. Why leave out information like that? Dick move, op.", "NTA.  It's OP's call and they were understanding that Jen might not be able to make.  Making an exception for her opens up the floodgates of people angry they didn't get one.\n\nEdit: Ruling made before the details about the car wreck were revealed.", "NTA\n\nYou said no kids. She agreed to no kids. She has bothered you again about the kids. You still say no kids. If she wants to come, she should find a babysitter. \n\nAlso, why is your mom getting involved? I don't see why this concerns her. This seems like a you and Jen problem.", "NTA........... \n I have never understood how and why parents chose sides instead of trying to find neutral ground.\n\nEdit: Just found out from other comments about the baby's father. That's really sad. And I understand too why the mom is upset. \n\nBut here's the thing. It's the OPs wedding so she gets to decide how things are gonna work. Also she made the no kids rule much before the unfortunate event with the baby's father came to pass. She hasn't even been rude or disrespectful to her sister since she mentioned she declined politely when the request was made for the 2nd time. \n\nSo I do think that the mom shouldn't be choosing sides. It's a big day for OP and while she can consider making an exception, the mom cannot force here to do so. And threatening to not attend the wedding isn't really is good thing to do either.  Considering this situation they all need to sit down and find a way out so family can be there for family.", "N-T-A. I don't blame you for not wanting kids at your wedding, they're a distraction and can take attention away from what is supposed to be *your* day.\n\nHowever, it is your mother escalating the situation, not your sister, so don't take it out on Jen. Your mother needs to realize that it's your wedding, your decision, and in the end, she's only going to regret missing her child's wedding if she skips because of this.\n\nAlso, if the wedding is a few weeks away, there's still enough time that Jen could potentially find some other solution, so if you both want her to be at your wedding, maybe help her figure something out.\n\nETA: Given the new info that has surfaced, I am changing my vote to a *MASSIVE* YTA. \n\nFirst, for withholding crucial information that affects judgement. \n\nSecond, and most importantly, do you have any feelings at all? Normally, I would say don't make an exception on what you've established for everyone else, but this is an *extremely sensitive situation* and I'm absolutely shocked that you don't seem to have an iota of care for your sister's situation or loss. Absolutely an AH if you don't let her bring her child along so she's not completely isolated from the wedding and party, and I don't blame your mother for wanting to stay with her rather than go to your wedding if you're this horrible of a person.", "First and foremost, it's you're wedding. You can decide who can and cannot attend, and what conditions and rules all guests must follow. That includes not allowing any children. This has long been established as acceptable behavior for the bride and groom.\n\nJen cannot expect you to cater to her and her daughter just because the arrangements she made fell through. It sucks, but the world does not revolve around her. If you allow her to bring her daughter, and that privilege was not extended to your other guests with children, it will look bad on you both, because presumably everyone else will have paid a babysitter or other arrangements for their children so they could attend.\n\nAlso, to all the people saying you're in the wrong, I don't see any of THEM stepping up to babysit Jen's daughter? I don't see any of them volunteering any ideas. They need to get off their soapbox unless they're willing to put their money where their mouths are.\n\n~~NTA OP. You're wedding, your rules. A 10 month old will 100% interrupt and disturb your ceremony.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm changing my judgement to YTA. You left out a huuuuge game changing detail about why the fiance could not watch the baby. The dude fucking died. This isn't a situation of a babysitter calling out. Her fiance died, and you conveniently left this detail out. It makes me wonder what other details you're leaving out. The least you can do is accomodate your sister at this point, because she lost her fiance and will now miss her own sister's wedding if you stick to your guns. At this point this isn't about who's in the right, but a matter of doing the right thing.", "INFO: what was Jen\u2019s childcare plan and why did it fall through?", "NTA\n\nYou gave her plenty of notice\u2026 and the wedding is still a few weeks out? I mean I understand not wanting to leave your baby alone with a stranger, but what does she do while at work? Why is that not a viable option?\n\nMy thought (and I could be wrong) is that your sister was hoping you would change your mind and didn\u2019t have a plan to begin with. \n\nYou are not selfish for wanting your boundaries to be respected.\n\nEDITED: OP is in the wrong and knows it. Otherwise, she would have mentioned her sister\u2019s circumstances in the original post for all to se and render judgement.", "NTA   \n\n\nyour wedding, your choice. you didn't do anything disrespectful, you held a boundary, something that pisses a lot of controlling people off lmao", "NTA, its your event, you can make the rules. Sure, its sad that her childcare fell through or something, but it is what it is. Its not the end of the world.", "NTA\n\nIt's increasingly more common to have a child free wedding. This is your wedding. If they can't respect the no child rule, then they are the problem, not you.", "EDIT\nDue to knowing the real reason Jen can\u2019t leave the baby with her partner, I change my vote to YTA\nit\u2019s totally understandable why Jen wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving the baby with anyone. \nMake the exception for her. She needs some happiness in her life right now. \nAnd mom is NTA anymore. She obviously empathizes with Jen at this time. \n\nNTA \nbut I\u2019d go as far to say mom is. \n\nDoes Jen not have a friend, family who can watch the baby? So her original plan fell through, not your problem. \n\nI never understood people who won\u2019t go anywhere without their child. Who wouldn\u2019t want a night out without \nchild care duties?  \n\nYour SS is going to literally sit at your wedding with an infant in her lap! At 10 months, even if this baby is walking, your SS is just going to follow her around while she roams? Sounds like a great night huh? \n\nJen can come to the ceremony, go check on her D, then spend a few hours at the reception. If she wants to leave early she can. \n\nYour moms stance is ridiculous. Why is it so important to cater to Jen? She\u2019d rather skip her one daughters wedding to do what? Sit at home with her other D to make what statement exactly? That she likes Jen better? That her grandchild is more important? That it\u2019s unfair to leave an infant out of a wedding that said infant is never even going to care about?", "NTA. No means no. This is your wedding, everyone else\u2019s opinions literally mean nothing.", "NTA but I always tell people I\u2019m coming given the babysitter shows and there are no issues. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to find a reliable sitter, even weeks out.", "NTA and not just because it's your wedding and your choice, but also because making one exception would bring resentment from all the others who have made arrangments to let their kids home, this is an entitled move from your half sister", "YTA\n\nEDIT: knowing from the replies that the baby's father passed away recently. I change my vote to YTA . It's one of the first family events she goes after loosing him, so letting her go with her daughter is the right thing to do, even if she is the only kid in the party.", "~~NAH - you are free to have a child-free wedding but don't expect everyone to be on board and cater to your wishes. If others don't want to come because of it, that's their right and you have to accept that.~~\n\n~~Making an exception for her is basically telling everyone else with kids that~~ *~~their~~* ~~kids aren't good enough but your sister's is and slapping them in the face. So it should be all or nothing.~~\n\nYTA both for the massive omission and the fact that it makes me question the whole story.", "NAH, well maybe mom. I do personally think that people should consider siblings children different than others. If you are getting married in a church, do they have a quiet room? Ours has a room separated by multipane glass that allows you to let your kids roam and be restless while not disturbing others.\n\nEdit Nope, just saw the part about Jens fiance. OP is an AH", "INFO Did her fianc\u00e9 pass away recently?\n\nETA: I knew something was off. Yes, absolutely YTA. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re trying to justify yourself by saying the only reason she\u2019s not included is that she would need to bring her baby, but she would need to bring her baby *because her fianc\u00e9 died*. Meaning, she\u2019s not included **because her fianc\u00e9 died.**\n\nFor you to say \u201cshe doesn\u2019t get to act all huffy and think the world needs to cater to her\u201d is sick, and your mom is right to be repulsed by the fact you seem to be completely devoid of any basic sympathy and compassion.", "Nta. Child free includes babies and once you make an exception for one you have to make it for others.", "NAH, as always with these wedding posts. You can have, do, invite, at your whim. And everyone else can submit to your decision and attend or not, as they desire. It only becomes an asshole situation when the parties involved don\u2019t respect the decisions and complain about any fallout that results. Maybe it\u2019s my culture but I have never been to any wedding that involved restrictions. Kids, the crazy uncle, the aunt that didn\u2019t have a filter, the cousin that was always in trouble. Plus ones were not limited any conditions either. All were memorable events that included all the human drama that come with these events, and all were celebrations.", "NTA. Rules are rules.  Jen can make other arrangements or not attend.", "Read the title and immediately knew NTA. And now reading the whole thing still NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and its your decision", "ESH, and by everyone I mean you and your mom. \n\nYou're entirely in the right to have a child-free wedding, and you made that expectation super clear, so no issues with that. But the way you talk about Jen's decision like it's her fault she has a kid and plans fell through...it's not a good vibe. Obviously yes, you're within a \"reddit-legalese\" technical right of not being an A H, but is this really the hill you want to die on? Is it really worth damaging your relationship with your sister and potentially other family members just so that you can be right? It seems like there are certainly compromises possible here and you're just trying to save face for your own pride. If others were to complain about it, there are any number of responses: \"It's my wedding, shut up...I made an exception for family with extenuating circumstances...etc\"\n\nYour mother is absolutely adding to this drama and it's incredibly petty for her to insist on not coming because Jen can't. If mom cares so much about Jen attending, she could babysit the kid so at least one of them to attend. Mom's the biggest A H here, but you really need to stop thinking about who's \"right\" and think about what you actually want your wedding and your relationship with your family to be like going forward.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding.  Your rules.  Jen has had enough time to arrange childcare.  If the original plan fell through, she can make another plan.  Surely there is more than 1 babysitter in the world.", "NTA. Your decision is not unreasonable. You've given your sister more than enough time to make arrangements. Her expectations are ridiculous.", "As other's have said you've made the decision to not allow your sister to bring her child to your wedding and this is the result. Its your wedding and if you dont want to accommodate your sister thats your choice- you dont even have to invite her if you don't want her there. You just have to deal with the consequences.  I don't agree with the one rule for all argument, a guest would have to be incredibly petty to think they are more important than such a close family member. If I were you rather than being so rigid, I'd look for a compromise - perhaps she could at least come to the ceremony and sit with the baby at the back. There is a compromise to be had, be the bigger person and find it !", "Edit: YTA. \n\nNever mind initial comment, keeping it below for posterity. \n\n\n\u201c I wouldn\u2019t really call Jen one either tbh, her plans changed and she confirmed with you that your decision was firm.

I mainly just don't agree with the bride and groom being the ultimate rulers of the whole day. She tried to find childcare, she couldn't. She still wants to come. According to the current rules of weddings, yes of course you can forbid children from attending, but it's a bummer. Your sister will miss now. Maybe one day you'll understand her point of view, maybe you never will, maybe this is your sister getting her way on your wedding day. But...meh. You're marrying the love of your life. It'll be perfect no matter what happens, and ya know, the more the merrier.", "Edited, yta for leaving out the part about the accident.

Yeah, you're entitled to not have kids at your wedding, but you *literally* just wrote \n\n>she'd still like to attend my wedding\n\nSo why are you saying \"if she doesn't want to come\" ?????? She *does* want to come but *cannot* unless she can bring the baby. And like, she gets to be disappointed that she can't come to your wedding, and she gets to be disappointed that you'd prefer no baby and no half-sister over having your half-sister there at the cost of her bringing her baby. You're within your rights to have that preference, but she's not an AH for being disappointed about it. \n\nBut really, the fact that you say \"Jen doesn't want to come\" as if it's her decision and not 100% your decision that she's not there is absurd enough to cement my YTA.

She intentionally hid that little tidbit to make Jen and her mom sound unreasonable", "He\u2019s dead.", "Yes. Yes it does. \n\nEspecially for your own fucking family. \n\nIs this your alt account OP?", "It\u2019s classic YTA bait. A tragic death only revealed in the comments? Arguments about child free weddings? It ticks all the boxes!", "it's also a repost. Exact same story about the baby's father dying in a car crash has done the rounds at least twice. Either that or OP keeps having silly arguments with their sister and leaving that part out and putting it in the comments.", "Sorry for the loss of the fiance, but how does that change the no children at the wedding???", "I tried a few minutes back with an edit but got some error message. Just tried again and updated it, thanks", "Most brides don't have compassion when it comes to their wedding.  OP may very well be an asshole, but not for not allowing a baby at the wedding.", "But with the same detail about the fianc\u00e9 recently dying in a car accident, and OP sneaking that info into comments.", "I disagree . Childfree is childfree. When you start making exceptions you have to make them for everyone. You aren\u2019t entitled to attend someone\u2019s wedding, and sitting out is perfectly ok. As long as OP isn\u2019t trying to guilt her sister or force her, there shouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "It seems like a baby sitter would solve the issue.", "Childfree is childfree for a reason. She doesn\u2019t want a baby potentially disrupting her wedding, and that\u2019s ok.", "Absolutely!!", "I couldn't have imagined attending a wedding right after my late husband passed away and yet Jen is still trying to support her sister by going. My brain is just \ud83e\udd2f", "Jen's fianc\u00e9 just died. OP finally admitted it.", "They fell through because her fianc\u00e9 died.", "The \u201carrangements\u201d that fell through were her fianc\u00e9 dying in a car accident.", "Yeah, she replied to my comment herself but she's not editing her original post (yet). Makes her even more YTA", "I fucking knew it.", "And in several follow-up comments\n\n> but since she can't do that now\n\nIs a VERY purposeful omission", "Yeah that\u2019s what I thought.", "No, lol. I shared she\u2019s NTA with the information she provided and you just don\u2019t like it. The fact that\u2019s her BIL is not alive is not relevant to that it\u2019s her wedding day. \n\nAre they going to change every family event and rule and tradition forever to make Jen comfortable? That\u2019s not realistic. If you disagree then move the fuck on.", "How does that change anything? If she can't find someone else to be with the baby for one night then she should stay home. The rule wasn't \"no kids but ones with dead dads from car crashes.\" Yes, the circumstances have changed but the rule was never about anyone else's circumstances. Sorry about his death and all but it has NOTHING to do with OP and her soon-to-be husband not wanting kids at their wedding.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. The entire time I read it it felt like I\u2019d read this exact story before same names and baby age as well", "Yeah, definitely with a dead or divorced sibling spouse and OP only revealing it in comments.", "Honestly, I hope this isn't real", "you absolutely do not need to make\nan exception for anyone else once you allowed the niece. Fuck any friend or\nrelative whose mad because i allowed my very recently widowed sister to bring MY niece to MY wedding.", "It's really telling of what kind of person OP is that they're not willing to budge on this matter considering the circumstances.", "Shit, did they? This is very critical information that would have been useful to know. It definitely affects how I view the situation.", "It\u2019s just stacking here. OP: YTA on top of YTA with some more YTA drizzled on top. \n\nAnd to omit such an important detail regarding why the original plan will no longer work. (Baby\u2019s dad now decreased.) YTA with how you even posted this! \n\nConsidering it\u2019s a family affair, Jen doesn\u2019t have many childcare options available. (You even said so yourself.) And after the death of Jen\u2019s finance, I\u2019m sure Jen has some understandable reservations around leaving her child with someone she might now know well or doesn\u2019t have a relationship with the child. \n\nAND to think Jen\u2019s fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t going to attend the wedding so he could stay back with his child. That\u2019s seemingly so sad, too. \n\nOP: IMO, there might come a time in which you won\u2019t have to worry about your relatives\u2019 children. Because you may find you no longer have ANY relative/familial relationships left. Please reflect on this!!! Your wedding is one day. Family is hopefully for life.", "I know right.", "Holy shit I think you\u2019re right. She just commented again\u2026..", "She doesn\u2019t want a 10 month old at her wedding and that is completely and perfectly ok. If the baby spends hours screaming and crying is she not allowed to be mad at that?", "And guess who was going to stay with the baby. No wonder why OP was hiding it.", "Does having a fiance die count as an extreme enough reasons things fell through and why the mom hates the lack of compassion?", "like the sister can\u2019t step away if the baby fusses? Listen i normally understand rules are rules. I just believe in rallying around my family during tragic times. Maybe the family wedding would give some solace to the distraught sister.", "This is such a huge game changer now. OP is definitely an AH. Conveniently leaving out details and probably embelishing the story to.", "Some do but not everyone. Thats okay however they cant be mad about that person not attending because of it. Which op isnt. She understands."]}
