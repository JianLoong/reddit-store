It\u2019s a super fun gig, but sometimes we deal with some interesting people. Also important information, I wear a bikini top and short pants. \n\nSo the other day at work, a cabana reservation group arrived and I went over to greet them and give them the welcome spiel. Before I could even get through with my first sentence. An adult male maybe in his 40s, shoved his credit card in my bikini top and said \u201cBucket of coors light please!\u201d and all of his buddies were laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world. I turned around and left promptly, completely flabbergasted by that behavior. \n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve dealt with worse, so I started his tab and grabbed him his beers, with the intention of telling him politely to not do that again when I brought them to his cabana. However, as I was approaching his cabana, one of the other guys in his group is URINATING in the mini trashcan inside of their cabana. I am the person that has to take the trash out after they leave. Also, the bathroom is not even 100 feet from their reservation. At this point, I knew that there was no way in hell I was going to be stuck serving them for the next 5 hours.\n\nI could not believe my eyes. I had never seen behavior like this. I put the guy\u2019s credit card down on their table along with their bucket of beer, and walked away despite them calling after me to place more orders. I beelined straight to the manager\u2019s office and told him what happened, and also told him I will no longer be serving that group. \n\nThe manager (29M) went over to the cabana while I waited in his office, and was in there talking to them for about 10 minutes. Once he returned, he informed me that they were sorry for their behavior, but I was rude for walking away as they were trying to order. To reconcile this, I was told to bring the cabana a FREE margarita pitcher. \n\nI respectfully but firmly told my manager absolutely not. When I refused to serve them, he tried to ask the other female servers (again, all of us are quite young) and they all refused as well after I told them what had happened with that cabana. My manager was furious, and he ended up having to serve them himself for the rest of their reservation since all of us were absolutely not going to take care of them. \n\nAt the end of my shift, I was pulled aside and given a write-up for refusing to serve that cabana and I just took the write up because honestly I wasn\u2019t sure if I was in the right or not.

Their behaviour was absolutely *not* going to improve after they started drinking, and there\u2019s no reason you should be made to feel uncomfortable because your manager doesn\u2019t want to push back firmly against people who are being rude.
