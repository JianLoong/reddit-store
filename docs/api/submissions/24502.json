However, as I was approaching his cabana, one of the other guys in his group is URINATING in the mini trashcan inside of their cabana. I am the person that has to take the trash out after they leave.

At this point, I knew that there was no way in hell I was going to be stuck serving them for the next 5 hours.\n\nI could not believe my eyes. I had never seen behavior like this. I put the guy\u2019s credit card down on their table along with their bucket of beer, and walked away despite them calling after me to place more orders. I beelined straight to the manager\u2019s office and told him what happened, and also told him I will no longer be serving that group. \n\nThe manager (29M) went over to the cabana while I waited in his office, and was in there talking to them for about 10 minutes. Once he returned, he informed me that they were sorry for their behavior, but I was rude for walking away as they were trying to order. To reconcile this, I was told to bring the cabana a FREE margarita pitcher. \n\nI respectfully but firmly told my manager absolutely not.

My manager was furious, and he ended up having to serve them himself for the rest of their reservation since all of us were absolutely not going to take care of them. \n\nAt the end of my shift, I was pulled aside and given a write-up for refusing to serve that cabana and I just took the write up because honestly I wasn\u2019t sure if I was in the right or not.
