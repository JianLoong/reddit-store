I (26f) live with my bestfriend (27m) of 10 years. He will be referred to as W from this point on to make it a bit clearer. We have been living together for almost two years and it has been great. We got along and only had a few arguments which I feel is normal, but nothing outrageous, until a few days ago.\n\nA couple months ago W asked me how I felt about having a third roommate. I gave him a clear answer of no. I'm not comfortable with that for a couple reasons such as we only have 1 bathroom and this other roommate would be male. I'm currently in the tiniest bedroom and said 3rd roommate would get the biggest. W understood my point and even offered me to biggest room. Now fast forward to a couple days ago.\n\nW bring up 3rd roommate again but this time its not a discussion. He says \"I talked to 3rd roommate and he seems serious so I dont know when I'll have him move in.\" I ask right away, \"so this isn't an if its a when now?\" W says yes. I was already thinking that how could he do that without discussing it with me first. We both pay bills directly down the middle and I had just as much right to have valid input on these things, but he just made that decision alone. Fine. Financial troubles suck and if this would ease some then I can deal with being a bit uncomfortable. There was also the bonus of having rent and bills split 3 ways so thats a plus.\n\nThe following day I mention to W about moving my stuff upstairs. W begins to explain that whoever moves upstairs is getting charged 100 dollars extra because the space is bigger. The rent is 730, split that is 365, so I say, \"That means I would have to pay basically what I'm paying now?\" W responds with \"no you would have to pay 465.\" I ask W how much would I have to pay if i just stayed in my current room. And W says I would still have to pay the 365. I go to say thats unfair and that they have already said I can move upstairs. W responds with \"I can't change my mind!?\" \n\nW starts to yell at me saying they do everything from washing the dishes, shoveling snow, and taking out the trash and that I just sit on my ass all day. He says that life isnt fair or that \"thats life suck it up\" and that the world doesn't revolve around me. A little context, we both believe that if you make the mess you clean it up. I absolutely never wash the dishes because I do not cook or use the dishes. If I'm not ordering take out I buy paper plates, forks, bowls, spoons etc. because of this exact reason. If I do use a dish, I wash it right away always. When W cooks he uses every single dish he can, as well as getting the kitchen as dirty as humanly possible. W told me to not shovel the snow because of my known back problems. I absolutely do slack on the trash and I admitted that and apologized for that.\n\nI decided to move out in 15 days or less. I don't plan on telling him but I'm not gonna hide it either.
