I'm not just daily making people cry and belittling people. I am well liked and have good friends/relationships. I just REFUSE to put up with bullshit. I'm very direct and to the point always. I feel like people most people meander or never say what they are really thinking. People will sacrifice their own sanity and comfort to not poke the bear. But me, if I am tried I will tell someone exactly what I think about them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most recent situation is with a coworker(39f) and me(23m). I'm not going to specify the type of job. She is a hated or disliked by all the coworkers. I don't let bullshit get to me so I never put up with it and she doesn't try shit with me. I've noticed that once people realize that you won't deal with it they just leave you alone. So I have good experiences with her but I see how she treats other people. She snaps at everyone. If she is doing a task and can't finish it she expects others to help. But she never helps other people. She'll work round other people's mess rather than clean but if you work around her mess she'll snap.  She also will deliberately set people up for failure so she can be mad. She just plays lots of mind games and has everyone else on edge. Can't get into detail because of character limit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently me, her, and another coworker(21f) were working together. Usually she doesn't get on me but this coworker is new and I guess she wanted to assert her dominance already. So she was getting me involved and picking on me. I just had us stop working for a bit and told her that I see that everything she does is a mind game. I'm not going to get into her home life but I know she is an unhappy wife and mother. I just said that she probably doesn't feel in control at home so she tries to be a bully at work. I wasn't even saying this in an aggressive tone. I was just stating observations. I told her \"people acted like this in high school but you're almost 40 and you're still this way.  Were you always like this or did you become a loser as you aged?\" I told her that I think she's weak. I said that I can see the insecurity in everything she does. Keeping this short but I pretty just told her everything I thought about her and she was quiet for the rest of the day. I saw her eyes watery at times. She tried to report me but nothing happened with that.  She told everyone what I said but nobody comes to her side because nobody likes her. I kind of feel like an ass. I know things are rough with her husband. They have phone arguments a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nTo clarify. I only told her this because she kept snapping at me and the new girl. To the point that I thought new girl would quit. She already pushed 6 other people before her into quitting\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not proud. I only feel like TA because she's clearly an unhappy woman. Every other day she has an hour long argument on the phone in the break room and then goes out to snap at every coworker. Honestly feel bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut hey, if that makes me TA, then I was TA in this situation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast Edit\n\nNot sure about the rest. But this is how I've handled every bully in my life. If you let them get you once even a small time. They see the opening and it only continues. She's done this with other coworkers and I'm not letting her do this to me. Getting Rid Of Bullies 101: Dismiss them as harsh as possible right away and don't give an inch. Then they don't come back.

They don't care who they hurt or how disruptive they are. A decent person would realize if they're having a jerk day, or listen if called on it. This type knows and doesn't care. They terrorize from misdirected anger, low self esteem or they just like to spread misery because it's fun. Decent people have rules, they don't and that gives them power. Approach them on their level and it gets their attention.\n\nWas it sad she cried? Was it mean to bring up her home life? Yeah, probably. But how much misery has she caused? If people quit their jobs because of her, how did that affect their lives and families? That's not good, either. I can't believe no one had addressed this with her. My bet is people have tried and it hasn't worked. Sometimes a person needs a wakeup call. Maybe now she sees it from the other side and decides to be nicer. Maybe she realizes how untenable her home situation is and makes a change to make a better life for herself. Maybe she just realizes that sometimes the victims fight back and she doesn't like that.

I'm not just daily making people cry and belittling people. I am well liked and have good friends/relationships. I just REFUSE to put up with bullshit. I'm very direct and to the point always. I feel like people most people meander or never say what they are really thinking. People will sacrifice their own sanity and comfort to not poke the bear. But me, if I am tried I will tell someone exactly what I think about them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most recent situation is with a coworker(39f) and me(23m). I'm not going to specify the type of job. She is a hated or disliked by all the coworkers. I don't let bullshit get to me so I never put up with it and she doesn't try shit with me. I've noticed that once people realize that you won't deal with it they just leave you alone. So I have good experiences with her but I see how she treats other people. She snaps at everyone. If she is doing a task and can't finish it she expects others to help. But she never helps other people. She'll work round other people's mess rather than clean but if you work around her mess she'll snap.  She also will deliberately set people up for failure so she can be mad. She just plays lots of mind games and has everyone else on edge. Can't get into detail because of character limit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently me, her, and another coworker(21f) were working together. Usually she doesn't get on me but this coworker is new and I guess she wanted to assert her dominance already. So she was getting me involved and picking on me. I just had us stop working for a bit and told her that I see that everything she does is a mind game. I'm not going to get into her home life but I know she is an unhappy wife and mother. I just said that she probably doesn't feel in control at home so she tries to be a bully at work. I wasn't even saying this in an aggressive tone. I was just stating observations. I told her \"people acted like this in high school but you're almost 40 and you're still this way.  Were you always like this or did you become a loser as you aged?\" I told her that I think she's weak. I said that I can see the insecurity in everything she does. Keeping this short but I pretty just told her everything I thought about her and she was quiet for the rest of the day. I saw her eyes watery at times. She tried to report me but nothing happened with that.  She told everyone what I said but nobody comes to her side because nobody likes her. I kind of feel like an ass. I know things are rough with her husband. They have phone arguments a lot.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, launching a series of personal attacks at her that include name calling = verbally abusive = YTA", "So you prefer to be the top bully, got it.", "I don\u2019t work in the Silicon Valley.  I work in *Ohio*.  You aren\u2019t allowed to use racist language at work.  Period.  You aren\u2019t allowed to make fun of your co-workers.  Period.  I don\u2019t know what sort of fantasy land OP works in, but none of the behavior she describes as allegedly being \u201cacceptable\u201d would fly at any of the places I\u2019ve ever worked.  A worker like that would have a target on their back, and only if they were the boss\u2019s kid or Steve Jobs-level necessary to the company would they be able to keep their job.", "No they didn't", "But she\u2019s shown a pattern of this behavior with other coworkers. She fucked around and found out. Don\u2019t snap at me folks and they won\u2019t snap back at you\u2026."]}
