He initially complied with them but then found a way to get around by factory resetting the thing. Obviously we weren\u2019t happy, and at this point we deemed our son to be still too immature to not be monitored due to his autism so now there was a zero tolerance policy. Another violation and his switch was gone.\n\nThen he sold it anyway and saved up for a gaming computer, which was initially in his room, but he kept violating our 2 hour rule that our family doctor recommended so we had to cut off the internet after that. He found a way around that too and so we had no choice but to bring it out into the living room where we could monitor him. It was either that or no computer, and he begrudgingly complied.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for a while and eventually we let him have it back in his room, but back out it came when he got a phone at 14 and tried taking it back when we took it away at night so the blue light and radio waves don\u2019t scramble his brain. We also appointed his older sister to keep him in check and multiple times she caught him with burner phones further demonstrating his immaturity and need to be monitored.\n\nAlso, he still has not learned to just ignore his younger brother trying to get a rise out of him and not inappropriately fly off the rails, which is super immature and as such he\u2019s not ready to not be monitored.\n\nNow his hard-earned computer is back out for all to see and he can\u2019t use the computer later than 6pm unless it\u2019s for homework, not even extensions for Khan Academy will be honored because he\u2019s lost that privilege. Privilege, not a right. Act like a child, get treated like a child. No data or midnight wifi for his phone either. I also made him sign a contract that gives us the right to pawn them off should he violate our rules again. Resistance will not be tolerated.\n\nYesterday I woke up to find the computer gone and the router reset yet again. I immediately went to my son\u2019s room and demanded he open the door but he had barricaded it with his dresser. I told him that if he doesn\u2019t open up and allow us to take his computer and sell it for rules violations then we will call the authorities and say our son is acting out of line and get him in check before something bad happens. That\u2019s when he exploded at me and just said that if I did that, he would never forgive me, tell my relatives about it, and piss on my grave when I die, which really hit me hard.\n\nSince then he\u2019s refused to acknowledge that I even exist or eat dinner with us and tell me about his day, and I feel terrible about what I said. At the same time, I still stand by my rules of monitoring him and am wondering what I can do.", "created_utc": 1670442665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfbmkz/aita_for_imposing_rules_and_restrictions_on_my/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He initially complied with them but then found a way to get around by factory resetting the thing. Obviously we weren\u2019t happy, and at this point we deemed our son to be still too immature to not be monitored due to his autism so now there was a zero tolerance policy. Another violation and his switch was gone.\n\nThen he sold it anyway and saved up for a gaming computer, which was initially in his room, but he kept violating our 2 hour rule that our family doctor recommended so we had to cut off the internet after that. He found a way around that too and so we had no choice but to bring it out into the living room where we could monitor him. It was either that or no computer, and he begrudgingly complied.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for a while and eventually we let him have it back in his room, but back out it came when he got a phone at 14 and tried taking it back when we took it away at night so the blue light and radio waves don\u2019t scramble his brain. We also appointed his older sister to keep him in check and multiple times she caught him with burner phones further demonstrating his immaturity and need to be monitored.\n\nAlso, he still has not learned to just ignore his younger brother trying to get a rise out of him and not inappropriately fly off the rails, which is super immature and as such he\u2019s not ready to not be monitored.\n\nNow his hard-earned computer is back out for all to see and he can\u2019t use the computer later than 6pm unless it\u2019s for homework, not even extensions for Khan Academy will be honored because he\u2019s lost that privilege. Privilege, not a right. Act like a child, get treated like a child. No data or midnight wifi for his phone either. I also made him sign a contract that gives us the right to pawn them off should he violate our rules again. Resistance will not be tolerated.\n\nYesterday I woke up to find the computer gone and the router reset yet again. I immediately went to my son\u2019s room and demanded he open the door but he had barricaded it with his dresser. I told him that if he doesn\u2019t open up and allow us to take his computer and sell it for rules violations then we will call the authorities and say our son is acting out of line and get him in check before something bad happens. That\u2019s when he exploded at me and just said that if I did that, he would never forgive me, tell my relatives about it, and piss on my grave when I die, which really hit me hard.\n\nSince then he\u2019s refused to acknowledge that I even exist or eat dinner with us and tell me about his day, and I feel terrible about what I said. At the same time, I still stand by my rules of monitoring him and am wondering what I can do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
