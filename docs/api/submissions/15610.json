And your FIL being a guest in your home and giving you the silent treatment is an AH too, but at least he sided with his own wife, unlike his son.

I put my plate in the oven so it would stay warm and made the grilled cheeses. When I brought my plate and the kids' to the table, my mother in law was very upset.

Like literally walked into the house as a lunch was being served.", "Fourthed and I low-key despise OP\u2019s MIL and her behavior would make me want to be as PA as possible because I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to cater to that level of bad behavior, especially at the expense of my kids.", "I\u2019m glad some people on this damn post have empathy.", "I just think that's a crazy opinion. It's a very common thing that when someone is letting you stay at their house, that you help out a bit by making some meals. I do it all the time, and people are always very appreciative. If that's how you feel about it, I hope you make it abundantly clear when you have guests over.", "Why do you think it\u2019s random? She said her husband is like that too, neurodivergence is often genetic", "Except you're going in circles, because part of what you should or shouldn't do certainly depends on info about her like that.", "It adds additional context to why it's so important that routine be followed. You don't even have to go into detail just my kid is neurodivergent and breaking routine is hard for them even with an explanation as to why to my mother in law ECT. \n\nBasically it makes you look like even less of an AH. Although even neurotypical children function better with routine as well.", "But that's the thing, your actions were (hopefully!) informed by the fact that your daughter isn't typical and would have a much stronger reaction to having a different lunch, yeah? So leaving out that part of the story is going to get you much different reactions than putting that information in. Because it's like...if it's an important part of her routine and will cause her to have a meltdown because she can't easily get herself out of the mindset that she's being punished for something because she was given a different lunch, of course the right thing to do was make her the usual lunch.", "So, I am neurodivergent, and I am not joking when I say that my routine getting fucked up, or something I have been looking forwards to not happening, can easily make the rest of my day (sometimes including the next day) utterly miserable, and something I literally cannot stop thinking about, and it causes a lot of stress as well.\n\nI turn 23 next month, and still have issues dealing with last minute plan changes.", "How are we supposed to judge your actions without an understanding of the factors that went into your decision?", "Well, judging your actions is very simple. You didn\u2019t mean to offend your MIL, but you did. That\u2019s what apologies are made for.", "But your daughter is central to AITA Redditor\u2019s decision. You only did what you did BECAUSE your daughter is on the spectrum. Demanding people not to talk about her condition is likely the main reason the MIL was so hurt because she didn\u2019t understand why you would be so rude.\n\nRefusing to talk to other\u2019s about your daughter\u2019s condition almost feels as if you\u2019re ashamed of it or want to pretend your daughter is neurotypical. She\u2019s not. No one will judge that she\u2019s not neurotypical, but if they at least know about it, they\u2019ll be far more understanding rather than pissed off. \n\nSo, NTA, but you could\u2019ve explained things to everyone far better. And be more open with others - especially relatives - about her condition and the minor quirks she may have. And they\u2019ll love her for that as well as the rest of her.", "That is admirable, but it is relevant - it is a known situation that MIL should, if not understand at least have the grace to accept without comment as being Not About Her. If I'm honest my first reaction was 'sounds like an opportunity to teach the kids a lesson in the importance of displaying adaptability.' neurodivergence changes what our expectations of everyone are. Family can sometimes resist the very concept of neurodivergence and insist that kids are being spoiled when in fact they are simply receiving needed assistance in managing their (emotions, attention, etc.). Sounds like what's happening here.\n\nYou certainly do not owe MIL a apology. It might be good for you and husband to sit her down for a (another, I'm assuming) talk about your kids diagnosis and what that means for how they interact with the world. It seems like she's operating on some misunderstandings.", "Since both of my sons are on different  ends of the spectrum  plus I was a peds nurse and I'm also a foster mom to another 2 kids ( 3 foster girls totsl in my home atm)who are ' special needs' I'd say I can give a good representation  of how I've dealt with situations.  I do not believe in coddling people. I deal with my own anxiety issues and I've realized the only way life gets easier is to know others are NOT going to make my life easier and once I realized that if I do my best to fit in with whatever is going on around me and also help those I'm raising realize that they aren't the only person in this world who has challenges life goes smoother. I'm the parent who could take my kids anywhere but, church and the movie theater and you'd never, ever know they had differences.  Why? Because I raised them to know that every action has a reaction and every choice has consequences.  No one gets a free ride in life. We all work for the things we want or love. You want that cookie?? Ok, we ask for it not assume you are getting it and you never ever just take it. You want the orange shirt? Ok, then you make sure it's clean. You don't like greenbeans? Sorry, you will still eat at least 3 of them at dinner.  I don't feel just because someone isn't typical that's an excuse to act like the world owes you everything nor is it ok to behave like a wild animal. I've seen people let their kids hit them, throw things, break things all because, they * the parents* refuse to parent. They want to coddle or make excuses because, it's easier than being a GOOD parent. I've seen people lose their kids to CPS because , they the parent didn't take their kid to the dentist, Dr or wherever because their kid got upset or anxious.  I've seen parents lose their kids to CPS because they shoved tablets/phones or whatever else in their kids faces rather than deal with the underlying  real issue which is they were too damn lazy to do their job... PARENT and raise their kids up right. Stop it! Kids will learn that they can be good people when people stop putting up so many roadblocks and making them fail. To me failing your child is not teaching them that life doesn't always go the way they want. If you want something work for it.\n\nEta: correct spelling and something that was left out.", "I never said their needs didn't matter. What I said was Life isn't fair. People * in general society* are NOT going to make it easier for you. It's up to you. I'm sorry you don't have a relationship  with your parents. I have a very wonderful  relationship  with all 3 of my own biological  children. I also have other children in my life. My home was always the ' safe place' to be for my middle child's friends. Now, I am a foster parent. Every single one of the people in my life know they are important  to me. However, with that said they know what behavior  is expected in society. They know that they don't see me acting a fool so they can't either. If they are having a tough time that it can be worked through. It's not the end of the world. After all, tomorrow is another day and another chance to start over. So before you try to bash me I successfully  raised 3 young adults who all 3 graduated  from high school . My middle child who is 28 this year is a surgical nurse. And I've started all over again with the 3 young ones I have right now being 7,6 and 4 years old. My biological  children are 29,28 and 26.", "It\u2019s not where I live but I just didn\u2019t give her the chance after I caught her the first time (kiddo was 6 months old and we were there for dinner) Over a decade later & she still complains about me but she knows never to step over my boundaries.", "I absolutely did not. That is a lie. You misread my comment because you assumed I had an issue with autistic people when in fact the people I love most are autistic.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Do you know how I know? There\u2019s no asterisk by the comment like there should be with this EDITED COMMENT.", "[deleted]", "As an autistic person, I can confidently tell you that every kid in a family having the same specific neurosis means it's the parent teaching them to be like that. Good parents of autistic kids focus on introducing flexibility and raising people who can achieve their goals instead of people who are limited by pointless habits they've been trained to prioritize over everything else. \n\nNo one is born with a specific grilled cheese obsession for Sunday lunch.", "Same! I'm 39(f) gonna be 40 this year \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 and I am neurodivergant. However, I wasn't diagnosed with it until 29. My whole life, though (and I do mean my *whole life), I've always needed routines. And I eat basically the same things every week. It destroys me when my routine is messed with.", "My son too (14.)  And I always feel so bad if he thinks he did something wrong and is being punished by a change.", "Get over yourself", "The only insane thing is your comment about chucking the food in the trash and banning them from the house.", "Gaslighting is a form of extreme manipulation used to distort a victims reality and make them question their own judgement. You are not experiencing that because someone on Reddit thinks your opinion on people cooking in your kitchen is extreme.", "These kids are YOUNG, two are young enough to be picky eaters without bringing neurodivergence into the mix. MIL has expressed that she thinks the kids are too picky and it seems like she was trying to prove a point. I\u2019m also autistic. So is my sister. So are my brothers. Your experience is not universal.\n\nEdit: not to mention, OPs daughter was worried she was in trouble, MIL is the one who threw a tantrum about food.", "No need to. I'm not a narcissist.  I admit when I'm wrong. Which I'm guaranteed  to be at least a few time a day. I also know when to ask for help and I love the people in my life fiercely and they know this.", "If you choose to live a small, limited, hostile life, that's on you and you're allowed to do so. OP is still TA for purposely raising her kids that way.", "Hostile? MIL threw the tantrum about food lol"]}
