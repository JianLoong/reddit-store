Now he's angry because you're telling his brothers?\n\nClearly he lied to you about telling his brothers.", "Usually sharing medical information without consent is a massive AH move. But your husband lied and told you he had told his brothers, and for them to get tested. So you were just talking about what you rightfully assumed was shared knowledge, so no harm no foul. \n\nNTA", "NTA.   You didn't know your husband hadn't told him, it was a perfectly normal conversation  based on your expectation that he knew.\n\nYour husband is an AH for not telling his brother, though. While I'm a firm believer in medical privacy, as a brother he should have been willing to share that information just to save his brothers a lot of potential pain in the future.", "NTA he lied to you and got the concecuences of It and now he Is blaming you", "Nta, he told you that his brother already knew- furthering the lie with the reason being so that his brother could get tested. How would you know not to bring it up based on the semi-elaborate lie lol? You weren\u2019t telling anybody his business, you thought he told his own business and you were just commenting on it.", "NTA, your husband said he had told his brothers so of course you would assume talking to your brother in law that he knew about it.\n\nIt's genetic so there's a high probability they might have it as well and it's important they get tested to find out if they're ever thinking about children in the future. Imagine one of the brothers found out through testing the same as you did and comes to inform everyone only to find out you already knew and said nothing, that would potentially cause a huge rift.", "Your hubby lied. He'll get over it. Nta.", "NTA!!!\n\nHe told you he told them. You were acting on that information. HE lied!!! This is NOT a good look for him if he's just going to lie and set you up for this stuff.", "NTA. He told you that he told them. You thought they knew. You didn't even assume they knew. He told you they knew.", "Im concerned your husband does not 100% understand what the doctor told him. Your posts suggests his inversion is on the X chromosome (otherwise the sex of your child would not make a difference) and this has been reported as having serious medical issues in the individual (ie. your brother) according to the medical literature. The doctor would have referred the whole family for counselling/testing and not just left it to an \"oh by the way\" conversation. Are you sure you have the full story?", "His business?? Seriously? He lied and is now turning the table on you? So it's your fault he said he told them and HE LIED TO YOU?!? Are you seriously asking if your the ah for being lied to ? \n\nNo your lying husband is a big red flag who lies and is like I TOLD I'm red HOW DARE YOU TELL THEM IM RED!!! \n\nNta nta nta op tell your husband next time he wants to keep his business away from the family DONT LIE TO YOUR FACE about letting them know...", "NTA? What? I mean yeah initially it should be your husband's place to be the one to tell him. Good thing he told you previously that he had told his brother. You aren't responsible for your husband forgetting his lies", "You had genetic testing done at age 19 because you were worried about infertility?", "NTA - solely because your husband said he had told them already.\n\nIf he hadn't said that to you, you would be TA.", "NTA. Your husband is a liar. He is the only bad guy here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Ultimately it was up to him to tell them as she was not permitted to release  the information herself", "I don't want to seem mean, but did anyone else catch the ick factor of him being 26 and her being 18 when they first got together.
