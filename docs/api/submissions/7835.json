That mom isn't teaching her kid a lesson about money. She's teaching her kid that she can't be relied on when emergencies happen. \n\nThank you for stepping in and handling this in a reasonable manner. You are giving her a chance to get a job and then begin paying towards utilities. \n\nMom is just mad her daughter was able to find someone nice.", "NTA. You know the kid. We don\u2019t. I am assuming that you believe in her and that she didn\u2019t lose the job because she is irresponsible and lazy.", "NTA.\n\nYou're letting a friend crash at your place for free for a bit. It's an awfully nice thing to do, and it's a matter between you and that friend. Your ex has nothing to do with it and she can butt the heck out.", "NTA. Thanks, Dad! You're the BEST!", "NTA. What is the daughter supposed to do with no job and being kicked out of her mothers house? Where could she go? \n\nYou\u2019re doing her a very nice favor and picking her up when she\u2019s down. You made an agreement to go 50/50 on utilities when she gets a job. If the mother can\u2019t do the same for her then that\u2019s on the mother.", "NTA\n\nThanks for teaching this girl that sometimes shit happens and you need help. You told her when she gets a job that she will need to pay half utilities why is that not enough for mom? How old is this girl? And how long has she been without a job?", "NTA this is a fully functioning adult she is talking about and you can do things as you please in your own home!", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re adults. It\u2018s solely a business between you and her!", "NTA.  Her mom is not practicing good parenting.  You're being a supportive parental figure to someone who needs it.  Try not to engage further with your ex.", "NTA - Your house, your rules. And frankly, I think it is fair that once she gets a job, she pays a portion of things.", "NTA because what the heck did the mother expect the daughter to do?? Sleep in the car or go to a shelter?", "NTA, the daughter is 18 and your ex is an ex. So this has nothing to do with them. I don't even understand what's the point of charging someone at such a young age knowing they might struggle.", "NTA, you owe your Ex nothing including a debate on her parenting style. Her daughter is an adult and can live wherever she wants.", "NTA - it\u2019s nice you took her in. 18 is a bit young to be expected to pay rent that quick. \n\nJust one note- she\u2019s 18 and she\u2019s vulnerable and clearly she looks up to you. She may mistake her admiration for more, please don\u2019t cross that line. And I\u2019m not saying you will, but I\u2019ve seen it happen and it almost always ends badly for the younger person. You\u2019re the true adult here. Instead try and teach her as much as you can about being an adult and life skills - budgeting and paying bills, financial advice, adult responsibilities etc.", "NTA.  I would have told her to get the fuck off my property or I would have her removed.", "INFO - Her mother kicked her out and into a possible very dangerous situation. Has the daughter a history of lazyness or not being able to hold a job?", "NTA.\n\n Also the daughter has no obligation to come back to her, so if mom kicked her out, she needs to be prepared to not see her daughter again let alone both living together again. \n\n\nBut there also could be more layers to it. My mom lives with my two sisters together (both way over 18) in a flat after they needed to leave the house as it was sold by the owner. Both need to pay part of the rent as it's too expensive otherwise. Once both have a secure job, all of them will leave the flat as it's too expensive for my mom to live there alone. Would one of them skip out suddenly that would be a really cruel thing. \n\n\nSo if the rent from the daughter is needed and she just don't want to share, that would paint a different picture.\n\n\nEdit: not different enough to kick her out on the streets though", "NTA.  An 18 yo is not a child.  Your ex is wrong to continue to  behave as if she has an active parental role in her daughter's life.  That said, it is no gift to the 18 yo to enable her.  She does have to progress towards independence, and it might be wise to review this arrangement every few months.", "NTA \n\nShe is an adult. You can do literally whatever you want and help whoever you want. The end.\n\nMy only caveat here is be careful. She is a legally aged adult who is pissed at her mom with a lot of free time. You aren\u2019t technically biologically related and things may get weird.", "NTA. She is 18!!! Charging her rent like that is just mean. She isn\u2019t going to be making $40K a year or anything with no degree, etc. you are very kind!", "So her mother essentially made her teenager homeless as a way to teach her a lesson. I also assume she doesn't know the very real dangers for homeless women?\n\nIt is reported that a quarter of homeless people are sexually harassed.\n\n>For example, 92% of a large, racially diverse sample of homeless mothers had experienced severe physical and/or sexual violence at some point in their lives (Browne & Bassuk, 1997). Thirteen percent of another sample of homeless women reported having been raped in the past 12 months, and half of these women were raped at least twice (Wenzel, et al., 2000).\n\nYour ex isn't trying to teach her a lesson, she is sending her to get assaulted and raped.\n\nYTA\n\n[source](https://vawnet.org/material/no-safe-place-sexual-assault-lives-homeless-women)\n\nThe comment about 1/4 was from a random google search and I can't find the website saying that anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm 40 now and still question my decision making. The daughter needs someone like you in her corner cheering her on helping to guide her into adult hood. Mom isn't doing that.

If she isn't also going to school you might encourage that - seriously this is the PERFECT situation for her to go to a community college or trade school - she's still very young, and she'd be able to have a part time job for 1/2 the utility bill with plenty of time for classes and studying.
