It's pretty obvious why she is your ex.", "I have a father figure very similar to your situation, and he did this for me at a time that I really needed it. 4 bedroom house rent free for me. NTA at all, you have a big heart and she will forever be thankful that you gave her that opportunity!", "Nta. None of that is your problem", "NTA \n\nThe mom isn't TA for charging her daughter rent however she was TA on how she handled finding out her daughter was living rent free.\n\nShe should have been better in communicating her issue to you about the situation. Though it also wasn't her place to get involved since her child is an adult and no longer a child. \n\nI'm wondering if this young girl has issues with managing her financies. Or other character defects that played a part in her getting kicked out.\n\nIt's good you are helping her but try not to enable her bad habits (if she has any).", "NTA. You have shown your step daughter that you will help her when she has a problem, like losing her job!  While her mother will kick her out when daughter no longer has money.\n\nYou do need to talk to daughter about \n\n1) whatever house rules you need (keeping the kitchen clean or splitting chores), and \n\n2) job hunting, not letting it slide. Ask her to Set goals like number of applications. \n\n3. Or perhaps offer to house her, for 1/2 utilities, if she wants to get a half time job and go to community college or learn a trade.", "NTA - your house, your rules.", "It's simple. The primary care giver may not be in a financial position to finance another adult living under their roof.", "Aw she's still a child. Thanks for giving her a stable launch pad as she goes through the multi year process of becoming a fully fledged adult\n\nIt's insane to expect every 19 yr old to fully support themselves in the current economy, rent is crazy, food prices have exploded, used car prices have exploded...", "NTA\n\nDoin alright OP. People like you help keep the world from falling apart.", "Nta, your ex has a strong case of nonya... ain't non ya/her business. You two are broken up and her daughter is an adult.", "NTA. What lesson does being homeless teach her? That her family doesn't have her back? That being homeless sucks?", "Ummm. If her daughter is grown-up enough to be paying rent since she was 18, then she is also grown-up enough that your ex is out of the \"teaching her (daughter) a lesson\" business. The only thing the mom would have a say in is where she is providing support to her daughter. Since she's not providing her daughter support for housing, she has no say in where her daughter lives.", "NTA and in the words of Mel Horowitz \u201cYou divorce wives not children.\u201d", " Well I can certainly understand why she's the ex.  Her daughter is 18, not a child.  Her living arrangements now are up to her.  However, you really do want her to learn how to be independent so write a contract stating what she is responsible for i.e utilities and a kick out notice if she fails to keep up her end of the deal.", "NTA, and what exactly was her plan for the kid?  What lesson was she trying to teach?\n\nYou might ask your might-as-well-be-daughter why she got fired.  Did she protest being jerked around by a jerk-ass boss?  Was she late too many times because her mother was supposed to provide transportation but flaked?  Did they eliminate her position?  The answer may be illuminating.", "NTA. Making her daughter homeless is not teaching a lesson. Since she sees daughter as an independent adult, she should applaud daughter\u2019s decision to stay where it makes most financial sense.", "She's over 18. Parent teaching time is in the rearview mirror. NTA.", "Lots of parents collect \"rent\" that they save and end up giving back the kids later on, as a way to practice \"adulting\". Or families too poor not to have share their expenses with their adult kids. \n\nBut this case is abusive parenting 101. \"Rent\" also a perfect control and manipulation tactic. Ex lost her slave and now she's complaining.", "Or she likes having the extra money to blow on whatever .", "It wouldn't be extra money if she breaks even with her expenses.\n\nThe money for rent reimburses her the money she used. Besides that rent is compensation for her living there. So it's not 'extra' no matter how you try to spin it. She's paying for the ability to be in that space along with the expenses her mother incurs.", "Well the daughter left so those increased expenses left but yet she\u2019s bitching out OP for his kindness . Seems to me mom is probably really more concerned that she isn\u2019t getting that \u201crent\u201d anymore than she is about any kind of \u201clesson\u201d. Here\u2019s a lesson for mom: Kid is 18 & mom no longer has any say and should mind her own business. Find a new roommate"]}
