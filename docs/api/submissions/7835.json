That mom isn't teaching her kid a lesson about money. She's teaching her kid that she can't be relied on when emergencies happen. \n\nThank you for stepping in and handling this in a reasonable manner.

It's an awfully nice thing to do, and it's a matter between you and that friend. Your ex has nothing to do with it and she can butt the heck out.", "NTA. Thanks, Dad! You're the BEST!", "NTA. What is the daughter supposed to do with no job and being kicked out of her mothers house? Where could she go? \n\nYou\u2019re doing her a very nice favor and picking her up when she\u2019s down.

It\u2018s solely a business between you and her!", "NTA.  Her mom is not practicing good parenting.  You're being a supportive parental figure to someone who needs it.

And frankly, I think it is fair that once she gets a job, she pays a portion of things.", "NTA because what the heck did the mother expect the daughter to do?? Sleep in the car or go to a shelter?", "NTA, the daughter is 18 and your ex is an ex. So this has nothing to do with them. I don't even understand what's the point of charging someone at such a young age knowing they might struggle.", "NTA, you owe your Ex nothing including a debate on her parenting style. Her daughter is an adult and can live wherever she wants.", "NTA - it\u2019s nice you took her in. 18 is a bit young to be expected to pay rent that quick. \n\nJust one note- she\u2019s 18 and she\u2019s vulnerable and clearly she looks up to you. She may mistake her admiration for more, please don\u2019t cross that line. And I\u2019m not saying you will, but I\u2019ve seen it happen and it almost always ends badly for the younger person. You\u2019re the true adult here. Instead try and teach her as much as you can about being an adult and life skills - budgeting and paying bills, financial advice, adult responsibilities etc.", "NTA.  I would have told her to get the fuck off my property or I would have her removed.", "INFO - Her mother kicked her out and into a possible very dangerous situation. Has the daughter a history of lazyness or not being able to hold a job?", "NTA.\n\n Also the daughter has no obligation to come back to her, so if mom kicked her out, she needs to be prepared to not see her daughter again let alone both living together again. \n\n\nBut there also could be more layers to it. My mom lives with my two sisters together (both way over 18) in a flat after they needed to leave the house as it was sold by the owner. Both need to pay part of the rent as it's too expensive otherwise. Once both have a secure job, all of them will leave the flat as it's too expensive for my mom to live there alone. Would one of them skip out suddenly that would be a really cruel thing. \n\n\nSo if the rent from the daughter is needed and she just don't want to share, that would paint a different picture.\n\n\nEdit: not different enough to kick her out on the streets though", "NTA.  An 18 yo is not a child.  Your ex is wrong to continue to  behave as if she has an active parental role in her daughter's life.  That said, it is no gift to the 18 yo to enable her.  She does have to progress towards independence, and it might be wise to review this arrangement every few months.", "NTA \n\nShe is an adult. You can do literally whatever you want and help whoever you want. The end.\n\nMy only caveat here is be careful. She is a legally aged adult who is pissed at her mom with a lot of free time.

She isn\u2019t going to be making $40K a year or anything with no degree, etc. you are very kind!", "So her mother essentially made her teenager homeless as a way to teach her a lesson.
