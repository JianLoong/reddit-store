I was topless. I always go topless on holiday if local laws allow. I\u2019ve done it since around the age of 14, my mum and sisters did too. I know it\u2019s a contentious issue especially in the US where people can be very prudish but it\u2019s just a totally normal non-sexual thing for me. In Europe it\u2019s very common and there were lots of topless women on the beach that day.\n\n(I'm anticipating certain questions here. No I am not a nudist. No I don't parade around naked at home in front of my kids or their friends. I just sunbathe topless on holidays and in my garden. The kids don't bat an eyelid but if I got any inclination it was a problem for them, I likely wouldn't do it.)\n\nHelen and Graham\u2019s kids appeared unexpectedly and ran up to us. I looked round and Helen and Graham were there too. We greeted them. I gave each of them a kiss on the cheek as I always do when I greet my friends. We stood and chatted while the kids played but Helen seemed quiet. Her girls asked me to play bat and ball with them. I said yes but Helen abruptly said they had to go. Kids were disappointed but Dan suggested meeting later for dinner. Graham accepted.\n\nLater I got a text from Helen to cancel dinner. She was upset with me for not putting a top on when we saw them.

And later her two girls were giggling about (quote) \u201cSarah\u2019s massive wobbly boobs\u201d. She said she didn\u2019t want to see me that night.\n\nI was upset. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d done anything wrong given that we were on a beach where loads of women had their boobs out. I didn\u2019t have a chance to cover up. The first I knew of their presence was when they were up close and had already seen I was topless. I\u2019d have had to walk past them 50 foot up the beach to our towels etc to put on a top. It would have been like shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted.\n\nI replied that I was sorry she was upset and that I'd made her angry. Since getting home I\u2019ve texted her again but have had no response.\n\nDan has seen Graham who said he wasn\u2019t upset about it, but he and Helen had argued afterwards when she accused him of enjoying the view too much.\n\nDan thinks I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We weren\u2019t expecting to see them.

And I get it could be a bit disconcerting, but again, that's for her to address with her kids, not you.\n\nIf she wasn't comfortable then it was on her to ask (not demand) whether you would mind putting a top on, but equally you'd have been totally fine to say no.\n\nAlso - you seem to be worrying that you upset her, when it sounds as though what really upset her was seeing her husband kiss you hello when you were topless. It doesn't sound as though she's worrying about having upset you by her behaviour.  You at least had the grace to say you were sorry she was upset and for your part in that, I can't see anywhere that she's apologised to you for being so rude or for cancelling dinner and making things awkward. You are not the Ah in this scenario. \n\nI'd leave it to her to make the next move.", "NTA.\n\nCouple of things get to me from what's been said here:\n\n\\- Helen has literally picked on you in respect of being topless, yet others on the beach haven't been noticed by her. Plus, you're the one in the wrong?  \n\\- You hadn't expected her coming onto the beach, so weren't to know of her arrival as you had no prior warning.  \n\\- You greeted them in a normal manner (as such), even though you were topless.\n\nIf there's been any argument between Dan and Helen afterwards, that's more on Helen for being the way she was in the first instance when she came over to you on the beach. Plus, if her girls ended up getting a chuckle from other women in a similar state of undress (forgive my wording here, no offence intended) then I can't see any issue on that front.\n\nEDIT: I meant to type Graham instead of Dan.

The good news is that you didn't invest more time in her.", "NTA, sounds like Helen is extremely insecure.", "NTA. You said it was perfectly legal to be topless on that beach, as other women were also topless. If it really bothered her so much, she could have asked you right then and there to put a top on.

If she was so concerned about her family seeing boobs don't go to the beach that allows it.", "I'd personally have done a little wave instead of a kiss in your situation but it sounds like she'd still be upset because she's insecure.

I\u2019d say it would be weird if you had gone out of your way to cover up when they arrived, you were topless because you\u2019re comfortable topless in an area where it was appropriate and others were also doing the same.

Be naked all you want, we'll catch up with you later. \n\nSo to that point,  it's not like the friends had to stay and engage if they felt she was inappropriate.
