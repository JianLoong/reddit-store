{"id": 15022, "submission_id": "12pfn68", "title": "AITA for not covering up my boobs when I saw my friend, her husband and kids on holiday?", "selftext": "Last week I (40F UK) went on holiday to Lanzarote with husband Dan and two kids (14G 10B) Independently our friends Helen and Graham were going to the same resort with their two girls (9, 7) We didn\u2019t make any formal plans to meet but said we might arrange dinner while we were there.\n\nOne day we were on the beach by the edge of the sea, paddling and playing bat and ball. I was topless. I always go topless on holiday if local laws allow. I\u2019ve done it since around the age of 14, my mum and sisters did too. I know it\u2019s a contentious issue especially in the US where people can be very prudish but it\u2019s just a totally normal non-sexual thing for me. In Europe it\u2019s very common and there were lots of topless women on the beach that day.\n\n(I'm anticipating certain questions here. No I am not a nudist. No I don't parade around naked at home in front of my kids or their friends. I just sunbathe topless on holidays and in my garden. The kids don't bat an eyelid but if I got any inclination it was a problem for them, I likely wouldn't do it.)\n\nHelen and Graham\u2019s kids appeared unexpectedly and ran up to us. I looked round and Helen and Graham were there too. We greeted them. I gave each of them a kiss on the cheek as I always do when I greet my friends. We stood and chatted while the kids played but Helen seemed quiet. Her girls asked me to play bat and ball with them. I said yes but Helen abruptly said they had to go. Kids were disappointed but Dan suggested meeting later for dinner. Graham accepted.\n\nLater I got a text from Helen to cancel dinner. She was upset with me for not putting a top on when we saw them. (Quote) \u201cWould it have killed you to put your tits away when we arrived?\u201d She was angry that I\u2019d kissed Graham while topless and that I was going to play bat and ball with her kids with my (quote) \u201cbare boobs swinging around\u201d. And later her two girls were giggling about (quote) \u201cSarah\u2019s massive wobbly boobs\u201d. She said she didn\u2019t want to see me that night.\n\nI was upset. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d done anything wrong given that we were on a beach where loads of women had their boobs out. I didn\u2019t have a chance to cover up. The first I knew of their presence was when they were up close and had already seen I was topless. I\u2019d have had to walk past them 50 foot up the beach to our towels etc to put on a top. It would have been like shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted.\n\nI replied that I was sorry she was upset and that I'd made her angry. Since getting home I\u2019ve texted her again but have had no response.\n\nDan has seen Graham who said he wasn\u2019t upset about it, but he and Helen had argued afterwards when she accused him of enjoying the view too much.\n\nDan thinks I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We weren\u2019t expecting to see them. There were other topless women their kids could giggle at and for Graham to feast his eyes on if that\u2019s what he really was doing (and by the way, neither of us think he was)\n\nBut I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve upset my friend and wonder if I'm an AH. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect this amount of responses. I\u2019m overwhelmed and appreciate all replies, whether NTA or YTA. Thank you all. \n\nCouple of things that keep getting raised/asked. \n\nWhen I kissed Graham, I didn\u2019t pull him into a full hug! \ud83e\udd23 I leaned in from an angle and air kissed his cheek. My boobs didn\u2019t go anywhere near touching him. Apologies if I didn\u2019t clarify this point. \n\nDitto their kids, I didn\u2019t contact them at all. They were mostly interested in seeing my kids, not me. \n\nThe bat and ball game was a beach tennis game. Wooden bats (shaped like table tennis paddles), small rubber ball. Idea is to try and keep a rally going with your opponent. It would have meant a gentle back and forth tapping of the ball. Doubt it would have been too successful with two small kids and I certainly wouldn\u2019t have been leaping around like Serena Williams! \ud83e\udd23\n\nSome are calling it a \u201ctopless beach\u201d. It was just a normal beach not specifically a \u201ctopless\u201d one. In the Canaries, you\u2019re allowed to sunbathe topless on beaches. Most people don\u2019t, but a lot do. \n\nSome have said Helen is jealous or insecure. I really don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. I think she\u2019s gorgeous and doesn\u2019t need to be. I\u2019m certainly no supermodel, I just don\u2019t have any hang ups about my body. She is smaller than me in that department, but I have no idea if that\u2019s an issue for her or not. It really shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nThanks again.", "created_utc": 1681737392, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pfn68/aita_for_not_covering_up_my_boobs_when_i_saw_my/", "score": 7238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I get it could be a bit disconcerting, but again, that's for her to address with her kids, not you.\n\nIf she wasn't comfortable then it was on her to ask (not demand) whether you would mind putting a top on, but equally you'd have been totally fine to say no.\n\nAlso - you seem to be worrying that you upset her, when it sounds as though what really upset her was seeing her husband kiss you hello when you were topless. It doesn't sound as though she's worrying about having upset you by her behaviour.  You at least had the grace to say you were sorry she was upset and for your part in that, I can't see anywhere that she's apologised to you for being so rude or for cancelling dinner and making things awkward.

Plus, you're the one in the wrong?  \n\\- You hadn't expected her coming onto the beach, so weren't to know of her arrival as you had no prior warning.  \n\\- You greeted them in a normal manner (as such), even though you were topless.\n\nIf there's been any argument between Dan and Helen afterwards, that's more on Helen for being the way she was in the first instance when she came over to you on the beach. Plus, if her girls ended up getting a chuckle from other women in a similar state of undress (forgive my wording here, no offence intended) then I can't see any issue on that front.\n\nEDIT: I meant to type Graham instead of Dan.

I was topless. I always go topless on holiday if local laws allow. I\u2019ve done it since around the age of 14, my mum and sisters did too. I know it\u2019s a contentious issue especially in the US where people can be very prudish but it\u2019s just a totally normal non-sexual thing for me. In Europe it\u2019s very common and there were lots of topless women on the beach that day.\n\n(I'm anticipating certain questions here. No I am not a nudist. No I don't parade around naked at home in front of my kids or their friends. I just sunbathe topless on holidays and in my garden. The kids don't bat an eyelid but if I got any inclination it was a problem for them, I likely wouldn't do it.)\n\nHelen and Graham\u2019s kids appeared unexpectedly and ran up to us. I looked round and Helen and Graham were there too. We greeted them. I gave each of them a kiss on the cheek as I always do when I greet my friends. We stood and chatted while the kids played but Helen seemed quiet. Her girls asked me to play bat and ball with them. I said yes but Helen abruptly said they had to go. Kids were disappointed but Dan suggested meeting later for dinner. Graham accepted.\n\nLater I got a text from Helen to cancel dinner. She was upset with me for not putting a top on when we saw them. (Quote) \u201cWould it have killed you to put your tits away when we arrived?\u201d She was angry that I\u2019d kissed Graham while topless and that I was going to play bat and ball with her kids with my (quote) \u201cbare boobs swinging around\u201d. And later her two girls were giggling about (quote) \u201cSarah\u2019s massive wobbly boobs\u201d. She said she didn\u2019t want to see me that night.\n\nI was upset. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d done anything wrong given that we were on a beach where loads of women had their boobs out. I didn\u2019t have a chance to cover up. The first I knew of their presence was when they were up close and had already seen I was topless. I\u2019d have had to walk past them 50 foot up the beach to our towels etc to put on a top. It would have been like shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted.\n\nI replied that I was sorry she was upset and that I'd made her angry. Since getting home I\u2019ve texted her again but have had no response.\n\nDan has seen Graham who said he wasn\u2019t upset about it, but he and Helen had argued afterwards when she accused him of enjoying the view too much.\n\nDan thinks I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We weren\u2019t expecting to see them. There were other topless women their kids could giggle at and for Graham to feast his eyes on if that\u2019s what he really was doing (and by the way, neither of us think he was)\n\nBut I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve upset my friend and wonder if I'm an AH.

I don't know how it is in Spain, but in Greece, all the people going topless on non-nudist beaches are tourists, usually Germans or other northern Europeans. It is definitely not a thing locals just randomly do, but we accept it happens. I would feel uncomfortable having a conversation with someone while they were topless. I don't get why your stuff was 50ft away from you, but if you couldn't get to it there were other things you could do, for example instead of getting up to greet them just turn on your chest on your towel and talk to them (much more common and less awkward), or for that matter pick up your towel and hold it in front of you. Or say hi and if they keep chatting, which they didn't seem to be in a hurry to do, excuse yourself and go get your top. Especially when the kids suggested playing rackets you should have said \"sure, let me grab my top\". There is no way on earth to play rackets and not have your breasts bob around unless you are literally half a foot away from whoever you are playing with. The way you phrased your edit sounds like you think it would be OK to play without a top on and from that I can tell your idea of appropriate is not the same as most people's. I think it's that attitude that put your friend off, rather than jealousy or whatever everyone else is saying. Topless sunbathing is fine but chatting for a long time, kissing people and playing games while topless are not. It's just plain awkward trying to keep your eyes of someone's boobs.\nAnd yes, boobs are natural and shouldn't be sexual, but they are highly sexualised, especially bigger ones. Unless you are breastfeeding, keeping your boobs covered in public is the polite thing to do when you're chatting to someone outside your immidiately family, even at a beach.

If topless sunbathing is popular on the beach where you were, I don't think you are the AH for being seen topless. But there are very much cultural factors at play here. Personally, I would be really weirded out by a topless friend leaning in to kiss my husband. I would also be weirded out by the friend not putting on a top to play with my kids. I might know logically that my friend is simply doing as the locals do but that doesn't mean I am comfortable with it. I went to a party years ago with a group of Europeans. They got drunk, stripped their clothes off and went out on balcony naked. There was nothing sexual going on; they were just comfortable and naked. Part of me admired the confidence but mostly I was just deeply uncomfortable having a conversations with someone naked. I ended up leaving.
