Telling **my dad\n\nMy dad has been dating this woman for about 3 years now. She\u2019s the widow of his former best friend (died about 20 years ago). That former best friend was\u2026far too interested in me for years when I was a kid. My dad knows all of this. \n\nI told my dad I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s happy, but I don\u2019t want anything to do with her. I don\u2019t want those types of reminders in my life. I\u2019m happy to still have a relationship with my dad and we can absolutely still see each other every now and then, but I want nothing to do with his girlfriend.\n\nFor around 3 years now, 90% of the times we talk on the phone, he asks if I\u2019m ready to talk to her. Every single time, I say no. I\u2019ve said a few times to please stop asking, as well. He usually lays off for a couple of months and then starts again.\n\nAccording to him, she swears she didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really care, to be frank. Even if that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t want this woman in my life. It\u2019s nothing against her at this point, but she\u2019s a living, breathing connection to the most awful things from my childhood and I worked so hard to get to a good and healthy point in my life, with great relationships with everyone else, a great job, a place of my own, and I just want to try and have some peace.\n\nI would never tell my dad he had to pick between us. That\u2019s the whole point of this\u2026he deserves to be happy. But so do I. I don\u2019t feel like these are unreasonable boundaries. My dad and I don\u2019t see each other often anyway. We have lunch together a few times a year. That\u2019s it.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? These are the worst memories I have in life and it almost drove me to a point of giving up entirely a few years ago\u2026I\u2019ve since then gotten a lot of therapy and am finally happy, finally having positive things happen in my life. Am I an asshole for not wanting anything to do with this part of my dads life and asking him to just have a relationship between him and I, not involving this other woman? AITA for saying enough is enough, stop asking me this?\n\nUpdate since I first typed this out\u2026.my dad called me, extremely drunk, confessing he never actually believed me about what happened as a kid. He tracked down another girl I was friends with who had the same experience as me and once she confirmed what happened, he wanted to apologize for never believing me. I feel so terribly for that girl\u2026and on top of that, thanks for the awesome nugget of information there. I had no idea he never believed me. He\u2019s been lying to me about that for over 15 years now.\n\n~\n\nEdit: I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone for being so incredibly kind and supportive. I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate that. This has had me in knots for the last couple of years and I\u2019ve felt this odd mixture of pissed off and guilty about the whole thing. \n\nI texted my dad and told him if he wants to have any relationship with me going forward, this needs to stop, period. No more bringing her up. No more bringing up my childhood. Just no more. This entire topic is off limits from now on and that\u2019s more than fair. \n\nHe\u2019s my dad and he has a ton of issues, but I do love  him and care about him. But I spent my childhood worrying for my parents and protecting them, which should never, ever happen to a kid, and I\u2019m finally prioritizing my well being now.

Keep those boundaries. \n\nNTA", "NTA it's not unreasonable to want to remove triggers from your life. (But might be helpful to get therapy for yourself in case these things come back to bite you in other areas of your life - trauma is a shit like that). And I am so sorry for the things that you went through (I empathise on a very personal level for all survivors of abuse).  \n\n\n>he never actually believed me about what happened as a kid. He tracked down another girl I was friends with who had the same experience as me and once she confirmed what happened  \n\n\nJFC I am SO SORRY that it took *another person* to convince your dad you weren't lying, and that he lied to you for so long! :( I know how it feels to not be believed by those closest to you when they hear about abuse happening. It hurts. The betrayal hurts so damn much.  \n\n\nI applaud you for still wanting to have a relationship with your dad, going forward. I couldnt' do it. I had to cut out all those who never believed me and betrayed my trust, for my own sanity. It wasn't until I became a qualified psychotherapist myself in my early 40's that I learned how to deal with my trauma (from when I was in my early teens - that's a hell of a long time to let it go unaddressed, do not recommend!)  \n\n\nGood luck, I wish you all the best.", " \n\nI'm not sure I'll be able to talk to her like normal after confession.", "I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through. What a terrible thing for your father to say\u2026and do, of course. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found peace with it all now. You sound like you have a very healthy grasp on it all.", "Wouldn't he be concerned that he not only touched you, but his wife as well.\n\nHe's pretty much protecting someone who could've been inappropriate with the women in his life.", "She swears she had no idea, but yes now they both believe me (since the other girl confirmed it all as well).", "I never told him about it when I was a kid. I only told him when I was 16 or 17, and by then his friend had been dead for a handful of years. But you\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t deserve our relationship at this point.

Thank you", "Thank you so much. That\u2019s very kind.", "I understand your feelings, and seeing those boundaries is what you need to do to protect yourself from that trauma. Your father sucks. He chooses not to trust you and constantly pushes against your boundaries. I don't blame you for having an affair with him.", "At that point, they became both the enablers and the abusers.\n\nThey want to sacrifice you to make their relationship better.

But the edit explains it for me, it's because he was living a different reality from you so his behavior wasn't making sense.", "i would of never forgiven him for getting with the woman tbh. the fact he didn\u2019t believe his own daughter is shameful\u2026\u2026you should think about going nc.", "You should go NC. You're right, your dad has issues and he's never going to fix them or work on them but he has expected you to deal with your shit (which he secretly thought you were lying about for 15 years!) Your dad, this whole time, has cared more about his dead friend than you and what happened. That's the reality.", "You're of course NTA, and your dad is very much one. \nWithout even adressing the facts he never believed you until someone else confirme , and lied to you all this time, it's because he  kept asking while you kept saying no, and to stop asking. Please start to apply consequences for this, as in X months of no communication each time he asks.", "NTA. \n\nI'm going say to you I wish someone would have said me. It's okay to go low or no contact with him. There is no shame or guilt in that. You are not to blame for this.\n\nYou can love him and care about him and realize he's not good for you. He is actively harming your mental health. While you put him first, he does not do the same for you. Maybe in a few years you will decide to get back in contact or stay no contact. Time and healing will probably give you better perspective.\n\nJust put this on the shelf and get yourself better. For once don't worry about (and protect) his feelings.

He didn't believe you until someone else confirmed they had been subjected to the same thing. Shame on him and for his subsequent lack of support. \n\nYou have a boundary. And as you know, you are absolutely entitled to one of those. You are not telling your father not to have his relationship. What you are asking for is reasonable.

The point is that through probably no fault of her own, she was one of the people associated with severe childhood trauma and the son/daughter doesn't want to  keep being reminded. That's not a punishment.\n\nThe father's recent revelation of not having believed them for 15yrs which also reflects onto her again (& again, perhaps unfairly) makes any sort of connection being established seem vanishingly unlikely."]}
