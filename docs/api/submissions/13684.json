Telling **my dad\n\nMy dad has been dating this woman for about 3 years now. She\u2019s the widow of his former best friend (died about 20 years ago). That former best friend was\u2026far too interested in me for years when I was a kid. My dad knows all of this. \n\nI told my dad I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s happy, but I don\u2019t want anything to do with her. I don\u2019t want those types of reminders in my life. I\u2019m happy to still have a relationship with my dad and we can absolutely still see each other every now and then, but I want nothing to do with his girlfriend.\n\nFor around 3 years now, 90% of the times we talk on the phone, he asks if I\u2019m ready to talk to her. Every single time, I say no. I\u2019ve said a few times to please stop asking, as well. He usually lays off for a couple of months and then starts again.\n\nAccording to him, she swears she didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really care, to be frank. Even if that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t want this woman in my life. It\u2019s nothing against her at this point, but she\u2019s a living, breathing connection to the most awful things from my childhood and I worked so hard to get to a good and healthy point in my life, with great relationships with everyone else, a great job, a place of my own, and I just want to try and have some peace.\n\nI would never tell my dad he had to pick between us. That\u2019s the whole point of this\u2026he deserves to be happy. But so do I. I don\u2019t feel like these are unreasonable boundaries. My dad and I don\u2019t see each other often anyway. We have lunch together a few times a year. That\u2019s it.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? These are the worst memories I have in life and it almost drove me to a point of giving up entirely a few years ago\u2026I\u2019ve since then gotten a lot of therapy and am finally happy, finally having positive things happen in my life. Am I an asshole for not wanting anything to do with this part of my dads life and asking him to just have a relationship between him and I, not involving this other woman? AITA for saying enough is enough, stop asking me this?\n\nUpdate since I first typed this out\u2026.my dad called me, extremely drunk, confessing he never actually believed me about what happened as a kid. He tracked down another girl I was friends with who had the same experience as me and once she confirmed what happened, he wanted to apologize for never believing me. I feel so terribly for that girl\u2026and on top of that, thanks for the awesome nugget of information there. I had no idea he never believed me. He\u2019s been lying to me about that for over 15 years now.", "created_utc": 1680315972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1288dx0/aita_for_telling_me_dad_i_want_nothing_to_do_with/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Poor other kid!\n\nSounds like none of the adults believed any of the kids", "ywnbta\n\ncompletely understandable\n\njesus that last part...", "NTA, but your dad sure is. How rude that he didn\u2019t believe you and it took a third party for it to sink in. It sounds like it wasn\u2019t really the widow\u2019s fault, but you need to wait until YOU are ready to meet her.", "NTA\n\nYou're not required to be around someone who's apart of your trauma. \n\nThe sad part is that your dad doesn't care enough to let you choose. On top of that it took him getting confirmation from someone else to actually believe you.\n\nMaybe stay low contact with him. It'll be better for your health.", "wow that's a lot. But obviously you are NTA. And i'm really sorry that that happend to you. You wouldn't even need a reason for not wanting to talk to her. Maybe you could draw a clear line with your father that you don't want anything to do with her or else you'll go LC/NC. Enforce your boundaries! Also your father is horrible for not believing his own kid and pushing somebody else onto you!", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry you went through that.  And your last paragraph, hugs to you.  You deserve peace from all of this.  Do not feel guilty for taking care of yourself.  Take care.", "I'm very sorry...\n\nNTA, assuredly. But you've just took a big haymaker to the emotional jaw from your dad that I hope you can contact your therapist and talk about, because that's a >15-year paradigm shift for you that you frankly don't fucking deserve.\n\nIt might be the case that you go from where you are--which sounds like low-contact--to straight up no-contact. He's dating the former spouse of *your* former abuser that he didn't even believe abused you this whole time until he confirmed it? Jesus.\n\nYou don't owe him shit, but if you choose to be gracious because it's your dad, and I get that, then you lay it out to him di.rect.ly: \"I will never be okay with your gf because she is a reminder of what I experienced, and if you continue to push it, I will stop all contact with you.\"", "NTA. I'm so sorry. Both for the horrible events and because your father, who was unable to protect you, didn't believe you.\n\nHe had to get drunk to admit that.\n\nI hope he finally stops pushing you.", "NTA. Your boundaries are totally reasonable and you're super kind for considering your dad's happiness while trying to navigate your own trauma. Your dad should be the one centering your feelings here. There is no reason he should not respect your boundaries on this except that he didn't believe you. That makes him an ass. He needs to stop pushing this woman at you. \n\nWhy was he best friends with this serial abuser in the first place? \n\nI'm sorry for all you've been through. I hope you're continuing in therapy and you can set firm boundaries with your dad and enforce them if he doesn't respect them. It is not your job to manage his feelings now that he knows what happened to you was true. You've got to take care of yourself.", "NTA. And fwiw, I am sorry this happened to you and that other girl. Frankly I would be distancing myself from him at this point, given what you now know. \n\nI am glad you are in a good place now. You are a person of worth and you absolutely have the right to associate with anybody you want, and not associate with anyone as well. Be good to yourself :-).", "NTA. \n\nI didn't read the post and I don't have to.", "NTA Your father doesn't deserve someone as awesome as you in his life. His apology also comes far too late and he needs to realise that he's fecked up in more ways that one, and not only owes you a true and genuine apology, but also to the young lady that he harassed for her story too.\n\nLike you said you also deserve happiness and right now I'd strongly recommended that you make yourself priority number one and DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.", "Your dad doesn't sound like a safe or healthy person for you to be in contact with. He didn't believe you, didn't protect you and still continues to push your boundaries about speaking to this woman. Please consider going no contact or at least taking a big break from him.
