Telling **my dad\n\nMy dad has been dating this woman for about 3 years now. She\u2019s the widow of his former best friend (died about 20 years ago). That former best friend was\u2026far too interested in me for years when I was a kid. My dad knows all of this. \n\nI told my dad I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s happy, but I don\u2019t want anything to do with her. I don\u2019t want those types of reminders in my life. I\u2019m happy to still have a relationship with my dad and we can absolutely still see each other every now and then, but I want nothing to do with his girlfriend.\n\nFor around 3 years now, 90% of the times we talk on the phone, he asks if I\u2019m ready to talk to her. Every single time, I say no. I\u2019ve said a few times to please stop asking, as well. He usually lays off for a couple of months and then starts again.\n\nAccording to him, she swears she didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really care, to be frank. Even if that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t want this woman in my life. It\u2019s nothing against her at this point, but she\u2019s a living, breathing connection to the most awful things from my childhood and I worked so hard to get to a good and healthy point in my life, with great relationships with everyone else, a great job, a place of my own, and I just want to try and have some peace.\n\nI would never tell my dad he had to pick between us. That\u2019s the whole point of this\u2026he deserves to be happy. But so do I. I don\u2019t feel like these are unreasonable boundaries. My dad and I don\u2019t see each other often anyway. We have lunch together a few times a year. That\u2019s it.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? These are the worst memories I have in life and it almost drove me to a point of giving up entirely a few years ago\u2026I\u2019ve since then gotten a lot of therapy and am finally happy, finally having positive things happen in my life. Am I an asshole for not wanting anything to do with this part of my dads life and asking him to just have a relationship between him and I, not involving this other woman? AITA for saying enough is enough, stop asking me this?\n\nUpdate since I first typed this out\u2026.my dad called me, extremely drunk, confessing he never actually believed me about what happened as a kid. He tracked down another girl I was friends with who had the same experience as me and once she confirmed what happened, he wanted to apologize for never believing me. I feel so terribly for that girl\u2026and on top of that, thanks for the awesome nugget of information there. I had no idea he never believed me. He\u2019s been lying to me about that for over 15 years now.", "created_utc": 1680315972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1288dx0/aita_for_telling_me_dad_i_want_nothing_to_do_with/", "score": 645, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no reason he should not respect your boundaries on this except that he didn't believe you. That makes him an ass. He needs to stop pushing this woman at you. \n\nWhy was he best friends with this serial abuser in the first place? \n\nI'm sorry for all you've been through. I hope you're continuing in therapy and you can set firm boundaries with your dad and enforce them if he doesn't respect them. It is not your job to manage his feelings now that he knows what happened to you was true. You've got to take care of yourself.", "NTA. And fwiw, I am sorry this happened to you and that other girl. Frankly I would be distancing myself from him at this point, given what you now know. \n\nI am glad you are in a good place now.

Some of it was behind closed doors, some of it in front of my sisters, them having to intervene. At various points in our lives we all went no contact with her, but they both decided eventually to forgive her. I didn't, because I copped the worst of it, and when I went NC she would repeatedly try to get in touch with me, would harass my sisters to give up information about me, literally would come to my work (retail) to get me trapped and force contact (if I saw her coming/in the store I would hide out back until she left. One of my sisters even loaned her a spare key to my Dad's place where I lived so she could let herself in to drop off food for me.
