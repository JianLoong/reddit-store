These lily-white northern \"liberals\" who quote rhetoric about how things should be have no idea how things are. \n\nYes, these depressed inner city neighborhoods are poor, and it's this economic disparity that fosters crime. But that doesn't matter in the moment. Just because the reasons for violence are unfair doesn't make the resulting violence fair.\n\nI know exactly why these depressed areas are dangerous. I empathize with those trapped there. I'm a little old middle-class white guy. If I'm hanging around in these compromised areas looking like I might have something worth taking, those in need aren't gonna ask me to fill out a questionnaire in case I'm one of the \"good ones\".\n\nYour friend probably loves those movies where an angel of a white woman shares her kindness with the poor black folk, and suddenly the qhetto becomes gentrified, and everyone lives the white middle-class dream.\n\nPeople who have never been desperate and hungry have no concept of how that feels and what it can lead to.
