Reasons to not let either mom's or dad's opinion have any weight in your mind:\n\n1. Your dad is always the victim and always right (in his mind); he is toxic; he believes you are beneath him as a human being.\n2. Your mom chose for many years to put up with and cowtow to this toxic, petty, abusive man (1) for appearances sake and (2) because she doesn't feel it's a big deal to give up her self-respect, her autonomy, or her boundaries to keep this man from being upset. And to subject you and your sister to this, too. Even though she freed herself from this self-imposed obligation, she complacently feels you should continue to subject yourself to this. So, apparently - in her world, it's OK for her to free herself from this man, but it's not OK for you to do the same. \n\nIf you think either of their perspectives merit any consideration, then give it its due. Otherwise, put their opinions in the trash where those opinions belong.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad was a crappy father. You are an adult that can make his own decisions. You owe him nothing. \n\nAs for his future wife's kids, what they do is up to them. Hey maybe she was a good parent, unlike your dad.\n\nYou mom spent a couple of decades of her life allowing herself to be steamrollered by this man.

Your mom is clearly still into appeasement, so I think you need to take her advice with a grain of salt.\n\nI don't think you need to be a doormat and play \"happy families\". I bet he really doesn't give a flip, but doesn't want to look bad in front of the new in-laws and his friends. The fact that the fianc\u00e9's kids are attending is irrelevant - presumably she wasn't verbally and emotionally abusive to her kids, so naturally they would want to attend. The same does not apply to you and your sister.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>... and said I'm holding onto small things from childhood\n\nBased on what you posted, these were not \"small things\".

He also says my mom chose me and my sister over him. \n\nI cut off communication after dealing with it for years, and being berated for not being able to be on my own for some time. \n\nAlso we\u2019re completely different personality wise, politically, everything so safe to say we have no relationship. \n\nI got one do not blame you for not going. I wouldn\u2019t either. In my opinion, my dad had the best he was going to have with my mom who loved him through all the emotional mental abuse, and him trying to make a new happy family when he\u2019s never even apologized for what he did to this one, would make damn sure I wouldn\u2019t go. \n\nOf course, my mom and other family members  would say I need to consider his feelings and go, but know you have every right to your feelings. You can forgive (or not) someone without letting them continue to think what they\u2019ve done is ok, without changing. You can be done with that person if you see no change or apology coming, and even if they did. They have to deal with the consequences.", "NTA. Sow, meat Reap.
