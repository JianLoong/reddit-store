I am partially deaf in my left ear and subtitles are on for everything I watch. Never had anyone complain. If I watched a movie with someone and they wouldn\u2019t put on the subtitles then I\u2019d stop watching movies with them too.", "NTA! But also cause I love Subtitles.

I struggle hearing and read subtitles sometimes. But they also annoy me, so I\u2019m gonna catch 22. \n\nYou certainly can\u2019t force your family to watch movies with subtitles. But your family has to except that you\u2019re not gonna watch them without the subtitles. So if they want you to watch the movies with them, they can put on subtitles. Your parents are the spoiled and childish ones", "NTA.\n\nI'm not deaf but I always use subtitles. I miss things by not having them on.", "NTA\n\nI love subtitles lol my partner (he is hard of hearing because of his time in the service) often turns up the tv and we have the subtitles on too. More often than not I\u2019m reading what\u2019s going on, this being a habit that I developed after I started watching tv with him. You honestly don\u2019t notice after you get used to it, which doesn\u2019t take long, your family can learn to be accommodating.", "NTA. \n1) subtitles aren\u2019t annoying \n2) your family lacks empathy.

They\u2019re great.", "It is pretty rich your mother calling you childish and spoilt for quietly leaving instead of putting up with your father\u2019s childish and spoiled behaviour. It would cost so little to watch with subtitles, and their refusal to make any accommodations for your disability is really disappointing. Your mother seems to want to pretend that the existence of hearing aids means that you do not have a disability, and therefore do not deserve any accommodations. Don\u2019t give into her (or your father\u2019s) bullying. NTA.", "Yikes, NTA... I have family members on both sides of this argument so I understand a little of your dad's annoyance, but if it is something with proper subtitle options it should be totally fine.  (I hate when the subtitles clearly don't match the content on screen but in streaming movies etc that's a lot better now than it used to be).  As long as you aren't using the built in TV subtitles, the in app subtitles/language options should be MUCH better.\n\nIf your dad is being an AH about it still ask him if he thinks apartments shouldn't have ramps for people with wheelchairs, or if viagra shouldn't be made for men who can't make THAT work without help.\n\nExplain to him that you are in your own home and are comfortably trying to relax and and enjoy a movie.  If he can't deal with your subtitles then ask that he wears a suit and tie and polished shoes to view movies with the family since that would be uncomfortable for him.", "Haiyaa your parents are TA. I love watching stuff with subtitles because I hate having my stuff super loud. I\u2019m not deaf but I get it and they should\u2019ve respected you. Glad you stuck up for yourself.", "I'm guessing you guys don't watch anime lol. English sub people depend on subtitles to understand.

I'm so sorry.", "NTA\n\nMy family mbers aren't hearing impaired and we usually have subtitles turned on at home because there are often spots in a show where an actor is speaking quietly or quickly and it's difficult to hear, or understand.  I get tired of having to rewind the show because sla family mbers missed something.\n\nBut if your Dad's insistence on having subtitles off clashes with your desire, and need, to have subtitles on, then the two of you aren't compatible as movie watching companions.", "NTA.  My mother and a paternal aunt both had hearing loss and needed hearing aids.  What most people do not understand is that hearing aids do not enable the wearer to hear normally.  My mother always said that when in a restaurant, she could hear a conversation a few tables away but not hear the person across the table.  Even though I am blessed to have good hearing, I almost always have subtitles turned on while watching TV.  Subtitles should not be that big of a deal for OP\u2019s family.  It\u2019s a simple matter in order to accommodate OP.", "A good father would go out of his way to accommodate his daughter's disability\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\n\nOne of my kiddos has slow processing speed (I know, not the same as being deaf) so they often turn on subs. I mostly ignore it, tbh I ignore it even when they are embedded and can't be turned off.\n\n\nMy FIL though,.over christmas, had no less than 5 meltdowns about Kiddo9 who kept turning on subs. \n\n\nIf subs help, then the minor .....intrusion..... On others shouldn't matter. You aren't forcing them to watch a movie filmed in Aslan.", "NTA\n\nI friggin' HATE subtitles. I read very very quickly so I read them way ahead of the dialog. And my brain does this thing where when there are words I have to keep reading them so I just read every subtitle like 3 or 4 times before it moves to the next. I can't watch the movie at all because I can't force myself to stop reading and pay attention to the cinematography or the costumes or anything visual. It ruins the entire experience. \n\nThat said, if I had a family member or a friend who couldn't hear, I would suck it up. Because they can't help that they can't hear. Movies would not be my favorite activity to do with them, but if I invited them to movie night, I would expect subtitles to be on.\n\nMaybe your dad is like me. In that case, family movie night probably won't work for both of you. He needs to be mature and discuss that rather than just making demands. You were not the one acting spoiled and childish here. He was.\n\nOut of curiosity, does your dad know that your hearing aids hurt after a while? If not, you might tell him, and then ask him to explain why he doesn't like subtitles. Maybe he has a brain like mine that can't focus on anything else when there is stuff to read. Maybe you two could come to some kind of understanding.", "NTA your dad is a ducking fick.", "Many modern TV shows and films have rubbish sound balance: \n\nhttps://amp.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/speak-up-how-mumble-acting-is-ruining-tv-and-film-20170201-gu2u5j.html\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that subtitles are becoming so useful for everyone!

You have a legitimate need for subtitles, and he can get over himself for a couple of hours. He needs to learn to compromise in family situations. He is not the center of the universe.
