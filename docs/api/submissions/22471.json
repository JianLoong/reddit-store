{"id": 22471, "submission_id": "151zww6", "title": "AITA for telling my poor friend that he's actually the privileged one now?", "selftext": "One of my very close friends Nathan (29M) and I (28M) met during our first post-college job at a prestigious finance firm, and we immediately bonded over the long work hours, shitty middle management, and general soul-sucking nature of making PowerPoint slides and Excel sheets all day. For the next few years, a lot of our friendship revolved around us talking about work and how much we hated it.\n\nA few years ago, I decided that I just couldn't take the corporate grind anymore, and I quit my job to move into the nonprofit world. While I now certainly make less than I would have at my old job, I'm exponentially happier, healthier, and absolutely love the work that I do. I also still make a very good salary ($80K/year) which I feel is more than enough money for me and my needs. Nathan has been ambitiously climbing the corporate ladder, and recently became a VP at his firm. He makes well over $300K a year.\n\nNathan grew up in a very poor family, and his relatives are still financially unstable and often ask him for money. I, on the other hand, grew up in a comfortable upper-middle class suburb with parents who have always been financially stable. They're not millionaires, but if anything ever happened to me, they could (and would!) help me until I could get back on my feet. Nathan does not have that privilege.\n\nI recently got offered my dream job, where I would be making slightly less money than I am now ($75K/year). Despite the money, I am genuinely giddy about this job prospect, and was pumped to tell my friends. However, when I told Nathan, his response was \"I'm glad you have the financial privilege to take a pay cut.\" Not \"wow AncientMesopotamia, I know you've been really wanting this job for months now and have told me all about how excited you are about it, congratulations!!!!\" or anything along those lines. I'll admit that I snapped back at him and told him that he makes triple the amount of money I do, and that at some point he needs to realize he's now got privileges of his own instead of pointing out mine. The conversation got a bit heated, and we agreed to hang up and cool off before talking it over later.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I should apologize to Nathan for what I said, or if I should stand my ground. I'm feeling angry and a bit defensive, which I realize is exactly the reaction that a spoiled rich kid would have. However, I also do think it was a bit mean of him to say that at that exact moment when I was so excited. And while generational wealth does give privileges that income alone does not, he literally does make over triple the amount of money that I now make, so it seems a tiny bit hypocritical for him to be calling me privileged.\n\nAlso, as a final note, while my parents certainly are well off, they do not support me financially in any way, and have not since I graduated from college 7 years ago.\n\nSo, I leave the judgement to you all - AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - Woah, this really blew up in a way I wasn't expecting. I've spent hours reading as many comments as I can, and I thank each of you for your perspectives - I have really learned a lot about privilege and what it's like to grow up poor from some of your stories. While it is nice of many of you to say that I'm not the asshole, I do think I approached Nathan's situation with a lot of ignorance and potential assholery.\n\nu/Equivalent_Joke_9617 said it best:\"I don\u2019t think it matters who\u2019s \u2018more right\u2019 here. What matters is whether Nathan has been a good friend and one that\u2019s worth keeping. If the answer is yes, a heart-to-heart talk should sort this out.Genuine adult friendships are hard to come by. Don\u2019t let a misunderstanding ruin it!\"\n\nNathan's been my buddy for years, through thick and thin, and so I called him back up to apologize. I mentioned that I really didn't know what his experience had been like, and that I was so proud of him for all he's accomplished, and that I just felt a little hurt and unsupported when he called out my privilege from the get-go instead of being happy for me. It felt like he was minimizing my success, but it turns out he's just been having a tough time at work and didn't respond in the best way to my job news. He apologized too and we had a really nice conversation. I think that since we started our careers at the same place and time that it's easy for us to compare ourselves, and we're both guilty of the competitive comparison game with each other. Anyway, it's all good now and I think we've opened up a good dialogue where I can learn more about my buddy's past and what it's been like for him, and try and support him with some of the mental struggles of coming from poverty. Listen to u/Equivalent_Joke_9617 and have heart-to-hearts with your friends and learn from your mistakes!\n\nAlso Nathan and I will be going to a baseball game next week and he offered to buy the tickets because he's \"loaded\" and I'm a \"non-profit schlub\" (both his words, both said with love).

Who has what job. Who makes more/less money. Who is right or wrong. Who cares. \n\nNathan had a jealous reaction & that upset you. He\u2019s right but he didn\u2019t need to say it. You have the option to make choices he doesn\u2019t because you have a safety net (parents). Doesn\u2019t mean you will ever need it but it\u2019s still there. Definitely makes life a little easier. Nathan believes he does not have a safety net so he\u2019s still grinding away in a potentially miserable & stressful job. Misery loves company so it\u2019s not challenging to understand the jealousy here. You\u2019re happy, he\u2019s not.", "NAH but you both are coming from vastly different money places. You accurately see that generational wealth has build you something he doesn't have. Something he is building right now so hopefully he can pass that security down to his kids. He can't really prioritize work happiness over pay with out cutting into that building he's trying to to do especially as the cost of living keeps rising.", "NTA. We can do all the mental gymnastics we want all day here, but damn, 300k???? C'mon Nathan.", "NTa", "NTA, been in your position almost exactly. It's amazing how quickly the new rich lose perspective and empathy. With the double whammy of not understanding how ridiculous their bitching is when they make $300k + Like what small percentage really make that kind of money. And if it's anything like my experience, it wasn't just one comment", "NTA. No matter what is \u201ctrue/honest\u201d or whatever, that\u2019s still not what a friend says when their friend gives them good news. As far as you\u2019ve written, you didn\u2019t even say anything rude to him but just pointed out that he does have privileges now himself. Which if he thinks he doesn\u2019t then he can eat dirt.", "NAH. He's right, you don't have any financial obligations to anyone other than yourself. If you lost your job, you know you'd have someone around to backstop your fall. He's still grinding at a soul sucking occupation because he doesn't have the opportunity to leave. He has others who depend on him to bail them out, but he has no one to bail him out. He's a little bitter about it.\n\nNone of this makes anyone an asshole, you just didn't understand the position he's in because you've never lived it.", "NAH", "OP, I don\u2019t think you understand the difference between people who start their adult lives with massive student debt and who have nobody to rely upon if shit hits the fan \u2026.and people like you. I\u2019m an attorney, and I get the holier than thou attitude all the time from nonprofit and NGO attorneys. Most of them came from wealthy backgrounds. Unlike them, I had to take a corporate job because I had a lot of student loans at the very high government interest rate of 6.8% (thanks 2008 recession). And more importantly, if I fail, there is literally no place for me to go. I will be homeless. No backup family to take me in, nobody to give me a helping hand, just me. Your buddy is not only dealing with that, but also trying to help out his own struggling extended family. YTA for living in your privileged bubble where you get the luxury of doing what you want and then throwing it in his face for not being as pious as you.", "NTA. What kind of friend says that when their friends tells them they got their dream job.", "It sounds like Nathan resents the fact that you were able to make a decision he wasn\u2019t able to.

He sounds like he just wants you there to take his abuse", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH.  Yes, Nathan should\u2019ve recognized that your new job was important to you and been happy for you as a friend.  However, you don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like being in Nathan\u2019s shoes.  Growing up poor is very traumatic.  This is evident in Nathan-he\u2019s in the top percentage of earners, yet he still has a poverty mindset.  He recognizes that anything can happen and can lose his job and comfortable income in an instant.  Try to be a bit more empathetic when he makes comments about money.", "NTA seven years out of college and you are both independent financially. He is still judging you by your parents income and not your current situations.", "NTA.

If he's a true friend, he'd be happy for you.", "YTA\n\nAnd Nathan is right", "ESH. He got his comment, you for confusing 'wealth' with 'privilege'. Your friend isn't privileged, he wasn't born to a wealthy family or landed a job due to nepotism or cronyism, he worked hard and you know that. His comment was out of line, but yours was just factually wrong and insulting to all he achieved. I think you both need to apologize.", "ESH yes you do have privilege to take a lower paid job bc you do have parents to \u2018stop it all, yeah\u2019 as the song goes. But Nathan was also rude. He\u2019s also,likely going through something, feeling overworked and then his family have their hands out for his money. He\u2019s likely burnt out and wishes he could have a better work/life balance but his background means he\u2019s afraid of being poor again. So he\u2019s stuck. You quit this job so you know yourself,\n\nSo please invite him to catch up and talk and make amends if you value him. I do think you should apologise but I\u2019d like to hope hearing your side he also apologises for speaking his inner voice out loud to you.", "YTA.  You ARE privileged.  Being able to take a pay cut because you know you have a safety net provided by your family is privilege, much moreso than having a high income due to grinding hard.", "NTA\n\nYeah he needs to figure out that just bc you have your own issues, ie financial insecurity/trauma, you don't get to take it out on your friends. You don't just get a pass for being an A. \n\nAnd it's not privilege to do meaningful work. Otherwise we'd say oh look at all those privileged teachers making low salaries but they are so privileged bc they can clearly afford to do meaningful work. \n\nThe guy making 300K+ is not the victim here. He's fully entitled to make as much as he likes but he doesn't get to look down on others for it, even if he's living in survival mode or will always have financial insecurity. It's definitely a thing - my dad has a bit of it - but it's not an excuse to look down on others. It's only how you make your OWN choices.", "I'm just going to throw out there that 300k to support yourself or your immediate family is one thing, and 300k to lift your entire extended family out of poverty is quite another. If Nathan is doing the latter, and from what you wrote it sounds like he is, no he doesn't have the privilege to earn less money right now.\n\nI completely get what you're saying and to some extent these have been Nathan's choices. But I also think you're underestimating the amount of pressure that is on your friend to provide for his family.", "NTA- but I think you could approach this with a lot more compassion and leave with everyone\u2019s pride and feelings intact. While it came across as (and basically was) an attack on you, it sounds like Nathan is under an extreme amount of pressure. His entire family counts on him and he\u2019s working a job that most likely requires all of his time and energy.  While it\u2019s not ok that he put that on you, sometimes friends need a space to vent and it sounds like he needs that. \n\nRather than saying \u2018you hurt my feelings by implying I\u2019m rich when you\u2019re also wealthy\u2019 maybe ask him where these comments are coming from*?  If he doubles down then yeah, you\u2019re allowed to disengage and hope he figures himself out. BUT, if he says \u2018thanks for asking, I\u2019m actually really struggling right now\u2019 then you know it wasn\u2019t solely about you. As someone working full time to ensure his family is ok he\u2019s probably looking at you, someone with a supportive family who won\u2019t lose everything if you take a week long vacation, and spinning out a bit. It\u2019s not your fault, but if he really is someone you want to see do well (again, not your job if you don\u2019t want it to be) then it\u2019s worth seeing if he will talk to you about it.\n\n*I love asking \u2018who are you talking to right now?\u2019 Cause it A) reminds the person to lower their tone if what they\u2019re saying is disrespectful and B) forces them to acknowledge that they\u2019re not mad at  *me* but at a situation I reminded them of", "NTA, but he may not have meant it that way. Plus, it was just one comment. You probably didn't need to start an argument just because he didn't give you the exact response you wanted.", "NTA. Your friend is jealous and scared. You said he hated his job. He grew up poor so it's really hard for him to take the leap and get a less paying job. Because he's scared of loosing it all. Still not your problem but it can make you understand that it's not that he's not happy for you. He just screwed up at that moment because he's too coward to do what you're doing. \n\nCongratulations on your new job!", "NTA. What the duck, Nathan", "ESH.\n\n He made a sly remark about how you can take a pay cut, so you snapped back at him. You both agreed that both parties needed to take a moment to chill and stop being offended before you have another conversation. Keyword here is *both*. You both know you did wrong, just call a brother up and apologize for snapping. If he stands his ground, he's a AH and just cut ties for a bit.", "Slight ESH, if you value this friendship you should talk this out with him and explain that you understand his past circumstances but it was still a rude thing to say to you about your new job", "I'm with Nathan, YTA. Not everyone has the privilege to prioritise a dream role over a comfortable income.", "I don't think either side is NTA here. He is probably stressing from the enormous weight of dealing with the job that he has chosen because it is fiscally rewarding and finds himself jealous that you indeed can chase what you would call a dream because you have financial security through generational wealth. Only somebody wealthy is lucky enough to get to do things like that. He is probably not happy doing what he does, but likes the money. You on the other hand get to do something you love because money isn't an issue. You hit the genetic lottery he did not. Trying to be understanding is the best you can do.", "This sub is truly something else lol. \n\nThere\u2019s another post about a girl calling a man patronizing and condescending for assuming she had help from her parents buying a $1 million home and everybody is saying he\u2019s a misogynistic AH, because he didn\u2019t think she \u201cworked hard for it.\u201d \n\nThis post is about a friend *actually* being condescending about \u201cprivilege\u201d and everyone is calling OP an AH for not \u201cunderstanding how his friend feels.\u201d \n\nWild. \n\nESH btw.", "NTA\n\nWhat he said was pretty rude and spiteful.  He's making 300k.  He's doing extremely well for himself.  If he's giving it all to his poor family, that's his choice and problem, not yours.", "NTA. Cry me a river to all the whiney bastards making $300K a year. The dream is to get that job and invest for 5 solid years so that you can retire out in the countryside.", "ESH but definitely not extreme on your end. \n\nHe should not have said that.he was being an A H by nit being happy for you. \n\nBut your anger toward his privilege is also somewhat misplaced. \n\nMy parents come from poverty. My mums mother was a widow with 8 children and my dad grew up in a village in India where the \"rich\" really owned a chicken and the whole village shared a well. \n\nMy dad ended up making around 200k with his IT job. That's obviously a huge amount. \n\nBut, unbeknownst to most of the world, he paid for the tuition of all my Indian cousins, he gave dowry money for my female cousins and his sister (yes. Dowry is outdated. Yes. He still gave it). He bought a small, 2 bd house for his mother, who cares for his brother with downs syndrome. He paid for my uncle to go to rehab and supported my aunty and their children for the whole year his brother was in rehab. \n\nWhich meant that a large portion was actually not going to him. From an outside perspective,  he is privileged to make what he does *and he is* but I also saw the pressure he endured trying to support his own immediate family + five siblings and his mother, which he wouldn't have been obliged/socialised whatever to do if they had money themselves. Sometimes I had to help my dad with paying rent because things happened in india (ie floods) that he paid to help with.\n\nAnd yes, it was his choice, but that's also somewhat of a privileged perspective to have - because it's sucks watching your elderly widowed mother try desperately to care for her adult disabled child and fear losing him because she cant afford to *live*.\n\nI realised this when I married my husband and his family is fairly wealthy. He never *ever* considered that his parents wouldn't be able to support him financially if something happened, whereas it was something that marred every choice of mine despite how much my dad made on paper. \n\nWhen I finally accepted the truth of that my life absolutely changed and I started taking more risks for my happiness. It doesn't sound like your friend is there yet.\n\nHe is still an ass because he is dragging your happy moment down. It's not the privileged Olympics. But you are acting as though your choice isn't influenced by the fact you have backup (even though you obviously still worked hard for it).", "ESH.  This habit of playing the 'who's got the privilege ' dick wag just needs to stop; it's stupid and divisive and fails to account for a lot of factors.", "Toss up between NAH and ESH, but I\u2019m going with the latter. \n\nFirst off, you worked the job with him. Long, hard hours. You knew the deal. You know he has to work his butt off all week long for his paycheck, its not easy for him just because he stuck with it.\n\nSecondly, it was a little rude for your friend to say he\u2019s \u201cglad you can [afford] a pay cut\u201d. Personally that does read a little backhanded, but at the same time can you see his perspective? He has to grind non stop at his job to make his money, so his old buddy who can afford to quit and work a job he enjoys for less than a third of the original salary is a huge slap to the face! \n\nThirdly, you saying he has privilege is ridiculous. How is he privileged, especially compared to you? You QUIT, didn\u2019t get fired or anything. You CHOSE to leave, willingly giving up your position. I hope you realize this and apologize because he is not privileged, he has made his own life for himself without the safety blanket of a financially secure home. \n\nSo while ESH, you should still apologize for what you said, and hope your friend will do the same.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, the friend should be happy for OP sincerely, and I\u2019m not clear if the comment was snarky or how OP was framing the pay cut.

You've been able to chase your dreams without the pressure of poverty on your back.  It doesn't mean you don't get to be happy but it is hard for Nathan to understand how you aren't scared and flaunting your fearlessness and proceived generational wealth.", "ESH, don't tell your friends how much you make.

Yes, your parents do not support you financially now, but if you needed it, they could support you. If Nathan quit his job tomorrow or was fired, who is going to support him? You also are only supporting yourself at the moment- could you support a wife and a couple of kids on the salary from your dream job? Could you keep up with the rent/mortgage, food, clothing and educational needs of your children on that salary? Or would you feel pressured to stay in a job that you didn't like because you have to support other individuals?\n\n$300K is an unimaginable salary to most people but we do not know how thinly he is spread.

You are also privileged by having grown up in a financially stable upper middle class family and having them to fall back on when times are tough. You didn't have to worry about being kicked out at 18 and worrying about how to pay for college while working or being stuck in a soul crushing job because you have student loans to pay back. You can 'afford' to have a 'low' salary because you have a safety net- a lot of people don't.\n\nThere are many different types of privileges and you and your friend represent two types. You might think that he is unaware of his privileged status now but you are also downplaying your own privileged back ground.

It was rude for him to say that, and I never would... However, I'm in a similar position to him and I can say that making his salary while having no financial cushion in terms of family (at least the first maybe 5-10 years at that income level), you'll still feel like you're living without a safety net. It's not a mindset you quickly leave behind. Ask folks who lived through the Depression or other similar circumstances. Certain kinds of financial duress stick with you. \n\nI grew up dirt poor and struggled financially until well into adulthood. I had relatives who constantly needed support from me if/ when I had the means to help. I still do. Now my husband (grew up lower middle class,\nstill no family safety net whatsoever) and I have an income not quite at your friend's level, but in that general range. We have no kids but we live in a HCOL area so that income level is by no means comfortable. It was okay-ish before inflation but not now. \n\nWe had several family emergencies this year. It feels very scary. Our income is no match for the COL where we are thanks to inflation and these emergencies. \n\nWhen you grow up without a safety net as we did -- you feel it. We hadn't had time to build up a safety net when the economy took a turn, when inflation rose, when the emergencies happened. So do we feel like my husband could switch jobs to one where he loved the work but took a pay cut? No. We are barely getting by as it is. (I am a WGA writer and we are on strike. So, I am desperately seeking work outside my field. But generally speaking it's my husband's income that reliably pays the bills.) \n\nI understand where your friend is coming from. I would never say something rude or unkind as he did. But his current paycheck doesn't erase the poverty he might feel as a result of the way he grew up. It doesn't just disappear because now you make money. It might take years of savings for him to feel safe. He might never depending on the severity of his circumstances. \n\nWe have friends who come from significant generational wealth -- some were gifted homes or down payments in one of the top 3 most expensive housing markets in the country. We cannot even dream of home ownership because we don't make enough to have extra. We don't have any hope of any money coming from somewhere other than paychecks. No inheritance, nothing, \n\nBecause of the needs of family members outside my 2-member immediate household our income always got spread a little thin. Your friend might feel the same way. So, I relate far more to his mindset than yours because I grew up similarly to him. \n\nStill, I wouldn't have spoken like he did. I would have kept that observation to myself. As I do all the time now that I see others with family help getting to buy homes and do vacations abroad while my husband and I struggle on what should be a good income... but just isn't enough to cover the COL where we live beyond just paying the bills. \n\nIf your friendship is valuable, have a calm conversation about the fact that you wanted him to be happy for you and you were hurt by his initial response. But that you also understand that YES it is a privilege to switch jobs and afford to take a pay cut. (We had a friend do that recently. She comes from great wealth.) He was rude to say it, but it's not untrue. You both need to apologize and deal with each other more kindly.", "ESH. You're both being insensitive.

Even if you had a loving family, at the end of the day, you're responsible for YOURSELF first. I've seen alot of families try to raise their kids up for success just to mooch off them(or just straight up mooch), so maybe I'm a bit cynical in this area. It's great if someone wants to share what they have, when it's voluntary. If someone's giving out of guilt of a sense of obligation that's not being grateful or kind. And if someone doesn't give, that doesn't necessarily make them greedy or ungrateful, because it's not their job or responsibility to financially care of their family.\n\nSorry to get on my soapbox here, but I come from a culture where you take care of your family, send them money when they need it, and take in your parents during old age. I've heard alot about sacrifice, seen my mother and grandma scammed out of money from relatives they trusted, and alot of entitlement too. I often get pressured hints dancing around the fact they want me to take my grandma in and live together (something I desperately needed to believe in when I was young in an abusive household), because her 3 children aren't doing it. Most of my sister's paycheck goes to rent while she works 40 hours under the table and has practically dropped out of high school at this point (all the result of my mother's lack of responsibility, parenting, and sacrifice mentality). My brother desperately wants a job to take over her responsibilities and be \"the man of the house\", and his friend, who's barely turning 18, already pays all the bills in his house, takes care of his autistic brother, while his mom is jobless and only calls to use his stuff.\n\nAgain, sorry for getting on my soapbox and the rant, but as someone who's heard alot about sacrifice and taking care of your family (financially and otherwise) it rubs me the wrong way for you to imply that someone is greedy, ungrateful, or automatically dick-ish for not doing so, if you do, great! If you don't, that's your choice to be respected. Something that took me a long time (and still is) to work through is that at the end of the day other people are not our responsibility, not even friends and family. We can't control them, and we don't run their lives, we're responsible for ourselves and our wellbeing first. I've dealt with alot of guilt about not giving my grandma and mom money, of not going over there to help more, of not being grateful for the good things they did, while I can barely get out of bed some days and struggle to even hug my mom sometimes.
