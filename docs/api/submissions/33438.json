Well. I guess this is outside the scope of this community, but she coerced me to give her power of attorney over my life when I turned 18 (it's been rescinded). So overbearing is kind of an understatement. There is also some cult involvement that I had to break out of. I guess I just still hold the feeling that my mom is right, and I am wrong, inherently.

I have cPTSD from my childhood and have been in and out of therapy for years (I'm in my early 40s). \n\nChildhood trauma is really hard to deal with IMO. It takes a lot to unravel it and reset your perceptions and understanding of reality. It can be done and there is definitely hope, but my point is that it's an ongoing journey. I don't believe most of us ever \"heal\" all the way and we have to keep doing the work to be okay. When you're ready, my advice is to get into that mom stuff if only to learn to set some healthy and ironclad boundaries."]}
