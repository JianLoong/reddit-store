Well. I guess this is outside the scope of this community, but she coerced me to give her power of attorney over my life when I turned 18 (it's been rescinded). So overbearing is kind of an understatement. There is also some cult involvement that I had to break out of. I guess I just still hold the feeling that my mom is right, and I am wrong, inherently.

Honeymoon was 80% of that.  \n\n\nMy mom was in real estate before she retired so she is well connected and experienced with home ownership, is why she was involved.

Or did that change at some point?", "Please get therapy, OP.

I have cPTSD from my childhood and have been in and out of therapy for years (I'm in my early 40s). \n\nChildhood trauma is really hard to deal with IMO. It takes a lot to unravel it and reset your perceptions and understanding of reality. It can be done and there is definitely hope, but my point is that it's an ongoing journey. I don't believe most of us ever \"heal\" all the way and we have to keep doing the work to be okay. When you're ready, my advice is to get into that mom stuff if only to learn to set some healthy and ironclad boundaries.", "NAH - But remember -\"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\" Usually, these things you needed were not free to begin with. You usually need to compensate people for their services, and you probably saved a lot of money for what these people provided, even after the \"tip\" you gave them/", "Overall this is an NAH.  You've fallen into the nebulous realm of \"What is a fee and what is a gratuity?\" and are experiencing confusion, as many of us do from time to time.    A gratuity or tip, as the name implies, is theoretically supposed to be a *gift* given in recognition of service.  But at least in the US, if you don't actually tip when you eat dinner, you're dicking over the waiter.  It's totally legal and allowable to stiff your waiter, but it puts you in the \"asshole\" territory.\n\nThe two examples you specify are kind of different and unique.   The lady renting you tables and hall decorations?  She's giving you something for free that you would otherwise have to pay for.  Tossing some cash her way would be an appropriate use of a \"tip.\"  The \"retired contractor\" giving you a visit and a verbal estimate?  Part of his normal cost of doing business and wouldn't normally be compensated even if you don't end up hiring him.\n\nIf she's nagging you about it that is an asshole move on her part.  But just reminding you of conventions around tipping doesn't necessarily bring it up to that level.", "Is it really bait and switch? I was taught it was good manners to offer a token of gratitude when someone does you a favour for free. For the contractor I'd have bought him a nice bottle of scotch and the arts centre I'd have made a donation.\n\nI feel like it's a societal norm to thank ppl you don't really know who provide a free service just to help you out with a material gift. Not worth the service but significant enough to show your appreciation. \n\nWhile the service may be provided for free isn't it normal to thank ppl with a gift?", "NTA, but have you considered not taking her recommendations?\n\nAnd that's not a jab at you, but if it's a reoccurring issue it might be worth saying \"thanks, but we want to look at our options before picking someone\" or \"we actually have a couple people in mind already that we really like so far\".\n\nAt least that's what I would do.", "Maybe time to stop believing the same lie again and again?", "NTA but for dogs sake, stop letting your mom bully you. You are a grown woman. Set. Boundaries.", "NTA and I'd simply say \"thanks for the suggestion, but I'm good.\" I'd rather know exactly what I was paying upfront than get something and be brow beaten into paying an unknown amount later.", "NTA and if your mom thinks they need a suggested donation, she can open her own dang wallet.", "Stop taking your mother's recommendations and the issue will be solved.\n\nNTA", "No, \"Mom, how about you offer them money for their services\" before she can say that to OP.", "LOL YEAH that's my bad I made that comment groggy", "Absolutely deal with any 911 issues with your therapist first, but do go deep on the worst of it. It may not be currently happening now, but it's the roots of the weeds in your life; you'll never move past them and the hurt/trama from them until you work through them.\n\nIf your mom suggests more \"free\" services, you are allowed to tell her no thank you that you're not interested. She'll push back, but just keep repeating it in a neutral-pleasant voice.", "Your mom is abusive. Even if she \"only\" is extremely controlling, that's abuse. I know what it's like to love your abuser, but until you stand up for yourself and demand accountability you will be stuck in that place where you're an oppressed, terrified little kid. \n\nIt's very difficult, and takes years, but her behavior is inexcusable. You should stop excusing it.\n\nThe only reason I'm able to get along with my mom now, after what she did, is that she genuinely and sincerely apologized. \n\nUntil that happened I was caught in the pain and anger and fear, and couldn't let go.\n\nPlease be kinder to yourself.", "You can love someone, but acknowledge that they are toxic to be around and not good for you and your life. You can love her, but set and keep boundaries. You an say no and still love her.
