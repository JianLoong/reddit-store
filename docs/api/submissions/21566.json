Tell your son he's an adult and adults have to contribute to get things. If he wants to act like a child then you'll treat him like one. I would have done the exact same thing in your situation. There's a baseline level of respect required and if he can't do that then he won't get anything from you and might not even be welcomed to stay in the house for free if the behavior continues", "NTA. Unless something has happened while he was at uni that you arent telling us, like arguements or letting him down or something that has caused him to turn cold with you.\nHas anything like that happened? Did he ask for something and you said not my responsibility or something?\n\nIf not then hes just become really bratty for some reason", "If he can't even be bothered to help with little things, I would draft a lease and start charging rent.  If he doesn't want to help out OR pay rent then he needs to find other living arrangements.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but have you tried having a heart-to-heart with him? If his behaviour has changed so much that his basic personality reads differently, I'd say there's something else going on. He could have had difficulties with life at college that you're just not aware of. He's suffering right now and it's spilling over. That's what you're seeing. I'm sure you can mend this with communication, love and understanding, while also setting some house rules. You've got this.", "NTA. All of your requests were reasonable for someone living under your roof; it's not like you asked him for a damn kidney. Keeping a house a home involves everyone living there, and if he's not willing to do his part, he can always live somewhere else for the summer.", "NTA. He's being a selfish brat and he needs to get out of that. Give him chores and if he doesn't do them he doesn't eat.", "NTA. \n\nLeaving the dog in the rain would've been enough for me to kick him out", "NTA. Not exactly sure what\u2019s going on with your son but he is in need of a wake up call. He\u2019s being selfish and entitled. Hopefully this is the slap in the face he needs.", "NTA - Yeah I would give it right back to him. Sorry but this is a tit for tat situation. I need money for trip. Your answer: It's not my trip \\*shoulder shrug\\*. These are simple asks that you are asking. He sounds ungrateful.", "NTA\n\nIf he\u2019s living in your house rent free (which is perfectly fine for a college student), he should at least do the bare minimum to help out.  So I think taking back the money was fair. \n\nHowever if this change in behavior is out of the blue, maybe he has something deeper going on that might be worth exploring.", "NTA \n\nYou've been pushed quite a bit by him to get to this point. I'm sorry you're having to deal with that.", "Not even letting the dog in when it's raining?\n\nHe wasn't like this before and suddenly changed after a year of college? That's so weird.\n\nBoy, I'd do worse than that if he were my son. I'd tell him the next time he pulled one of these stunts, he'd be out on his ear.\n\nNTA. And tell your mother he can move in with her and see how she likes it.", "NTA. He doesn't want to help family, no obligation to help him. Time he learned that you reap what you sow.", "NTA. He\u2019s going through a transactional, hyper-individualistic phase (hopefully phase). Remind him that he is a part of a tribe and community that he benefits from far more than he contributes.", "NTA, Your son is acting like a jerk", "NTA. You're giving him free room and board while he's home. He needs to pull his own weight. Are you paying for his college too? He sounds just awful. You need to sit down and have a long conversation about anything that may have happened to cause him to act this way and let him know it's not acceptable and that if he wants to contiue to act as though he's the only person on the planet, you will treat him as such and withdraw financial support.", "NTA but if this is new behavior like you say then there is definitely something deeper going on here. It sounds like either there is something that is being left out of this story or something happened to your child while they were away. People don't just suddenly become this way for no reason if they weren't this way before.", "Your mother needs to but out.

Ok, malicious compliance is now in effect. No cash for his trip is definite a must. He's 19 so he can get a job to earn his trip cash. Don't cut off his school funds or if you're covering for housing expenses while in college but definitely not trip money or money for extracurricular activities.

You are doing the right thing for you AND him.", "NTA, the grand total of time to close the door, let the dog in, and put the leftovers away is less than it probably took you to type this post. He is an adult and he can make choices to do what he is doing, but he better be ready to face the consequences for these choices. \n\nIf he was so thoughtful before, I\u2019m sure something happened to cause this change. \n\nAlthough, why is your daughter happy with the outcome?", "NTA \u2014WHO RAISED THIS KID?! \ud83d\udc40", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
