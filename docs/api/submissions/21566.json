Be clear about what isn\u2019t acceptable: he is not, ever again, to ignore requests with the welfare of an animal in the home in mind. Kindness to and care for the family pet is non-negotiable for all family members, and you expect an apology and some genuine contrition for leaving an innocent animal in discomfort for no reason.\n\nSecond element: minor requests. He can either do minor tasks like closing doors and putting away leftovers when asked, because he\u2019s part of the family and that\u2019s normal; or he can have an explicit and exacting list of tasks that he *must* perform, without reminders, and a three-strikes policy for failing to do so before he\u2019s going to start paying rent.

Remind him again if something is going on then you can talk about cutting him some slack once he\u2019s told you what it is and you have a plan to get him help with it; but to get that he needs to decide to talk, whether it\u2019s to you or first to a therapist.\n\nGood luck.

You are perfectly entitled to not do any favors for anyone else but you live with the consequences that no one will help you.", "It wouldn\u2019t be because the dog got wet, but because he deliberately did not take a minor step to correct the situation. It\u2019s not like he forgot, which would be unfortunate, but forgivable.", "I read part of this reply very incorrectly...", "But if they did wear pants, how far up the dog would they go? And would they have four legs or two?", "Have you seen the movie? It's a trip.", "Aliens, honey?  Is that you?", "What about alien dogs? Do they wear pants?", "That's awful man I'm so sorry you deserve better", "Yeah deliberately neglecting the dog is the point of no return on this for me too.", "Nobody forced you to go that uni situation. As an adult, it\u2019s your responsibility to work out your life.", "I feel like this is a little different, you were excited and understandably dissapointed when it didnt/couldnt happen, ofcourse your family arent A for being unable or uncomfortable to do it, but you are also not the A for being dissapointed. \n\nOps son however sounds like he just asked and expected", "LMAO definitely possible but personally I was way nicer to my parents after I started getting stoned on a regular basis lolololol", "The son is over 18.  The school wouldn't tell OP anything at all, and they shouldn't.", "I haven't even seen that online. I guess I'm lucky.", "It's an incredibly useful mindset for getting away from abusive people, and out of abusive situations. When someone tries to coerce and control you, they're often filling your head with your perceived debt to them, and tell you about all the things they have (allegedly) done for you (\"We fed you and housed you and clothed you inadequately and resentfully because we had to!\"), and why those things mean that you owe them now. Realizing that you owe them nothing and can just smile, say \"Fuck you and the high horse you rode in on\", and walk away is incredibly, incredibly freeing. Because then you only have to deal with the situation in the here and now, and not with this boulder of perceived debt that's on your shoulders and weighing you down until you think it's not only impossible to escape, but also immoral. \n\nAs for compassion, kindness, and respect, I like to think of that as a thing everyone deserves, and that is freely given instead of owed, because that appeals more to me, personally. We can't always deliver on it - everyone has a bad day sometimes, and gets sometimes snippy and rude, or has a bad interaction with someone. But if it doesn't work out well, it's OK to let it go, and be gracious about it, as long as everyone's trying. And OP's son doesn't seem to be trying all that hard.", "Fair enough, but if it is accompanied by a \"nobody helped me get to where I am today\" attitude, it is pretty gross. Lots of people help us throughout out lives, in ways big and small, visible and hidden. You often get people who claim to be \"self-made\" (e.g. Donald Trump) that espouse this mindset, and it is just totally untrue. \n\nWe all get privileges that aren't afforded to everyone, even if we aren't aware of them. Coming from a rich family, being white, being male etc are all examples, plus tonnes of others. For instance if you grew up in a rural area you likely (here in the UK at least) went to a small local school with a handful of other kids, so benefitted from far more attention from your teacher than someone who grew up in a city, where schools have 30+ kids in a class.", "Yea, I was definitely an awful 19 year old but never an unkind to pets 19 year old. That's kinda monstrous.", "I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t get sick! I can imagine how much it must have shaken him up though, pups and heavy rain/storms do not mix. Hell, I get really bad anxiety from heavy rain and storms, so whenever it\u2019s like that where I am, my dog and I basically hide out together and help each other stay calm (while definitely feeding off the other\u2019s anxiety \ud83d\ude33). Definitely give Jack tons of affection and attention, dogs can perceive not being allowed access to where their person is as rejection. He may have been feeling a bit rejected after that. Sounds like you\u2019ve already been doing stuff to give him that extra love, just wanted to point out that it\u2019s possible he definitely needed it emotionally after that :)\n\nI\u2019m sorry things aren\u2019t going well with your son, like I\u2019m wondering what happened over the year that changed his attitude and behavior towards y\u2019all so much. I know it may feel frustrating to re-enter a living situation where he has less independence/others have authority in a sense, but it doesn\u2019t seem like y\u2019all are pushing for control or going overboard as authority figures. It seems like he isn\u2019t open to any kind of conversation about it and at this point, it has all been pushed so far that communication is hard to do in a healthy way if it does happen. I hope things calm down and start to improve soon, that you and your son are able to start communicating in a healthy way and really get to the root of the issue so it can be fixed/worked on.\n\nGive Jack some love from an internet stranger please!!!", "There are areas where people can have issues with completing things, also where they have a complete lack of empathy. These can overlap but most with executive disfunction issues are actually feeling bad about something they cannot control, not doing the opposite and deciding its irrelevant a defenceless animal is soaked cos they could not be bothered to separate their posterior from the fabric based furniture.", "Yeah that bothered me the most.  We had a dog while I was college aged and I'll admit that I didn't do as much as I should have for her.  But I still checked to make sure she wasn't outside if it was raining and walked her when my dad told me too.  Was I all angsty and dramatic sometimes about the walks?  Probably, but I still did it.  Wonder if the kid is depressed or something.\n\nERA:  I was dealing with depression and an undiagnosed at the time social anxiety problem.  Definitely added to my moodiness.", "NTA. Unless something has happened while he was at uni that you arent telling us, like arguements or letting him down or something that has caused him to turn cold with you. Has anything like that happened? Did he ask for something and you said not my responsibility or something?", "That's where sonny passed the line from \"normal, douchy teen\" behavior for me too. Ignoring an animal's needs isn't just being a jerk, it's tiptoeing close to sociopathic callousness. Being an entitled jerk is one thing. Animal neglect is another.\n\nNTA, OP, but your son needs to start using his words an explaining why he thinks it's OK to ignore the needs of a dependent family member.", "[removed]", "Sure. But parents who were paying for it suddenly pulling it *in this specific economy*  is different than parents who simply CAN\u2019T pay. And he\u2019s not entitled to it but it sure is a commentary on his parents if they stop providing it for petty reasons.", "It is a right just not in America", "Depression doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. It just makes it harder to hide the fact that you are and go through the motions of decency. Failing to take care of your kids is not okay, depression or no. You have to at least get them into the care of a responsible person. It\u2019s your fault they exist and on you to keep them safe.", "No one's making assumptions. Anytime sometime has a big personality change, a doctor/mental health check is warranted. If it's part of the picture, treatment for that will help. Depression also isn't the only possibility.", "I was trying to be a little nice about it when I made my comment, but  that actually IS misogynistic behavior.", "Yes Dog it's been so long", "So if you go outside and I throw a brick at you, it's your fault for going outside?", "Is this supposed to be a joke?", "Is this sarcasm or\u2026.?", "Tbh it feels like something the kid from the post would be saying to their parents. \"Nobody forced you to get the dog if you're not home to take care of it!! As an adult, you should have worked something out!!\" When will people understand the world is not every man for themself?", "Imagine being this heartless and caring so little about your fellow human beings. \n\nImagine if adults were kinder and more helpful towards each other.", "Besides, it feels like you didn't read the end of the story when I did find a way to solve it without my mom's help. But if you're such a dick to people refusing to always help and believe them, I think then you don't have to complain those people start ignoring you and live their own grown up life for themselves", "This she honestly sounds a bit dim for repeatedly endangering herself", "That was my first thought as well.", "My mom thought I was on meth, which was so fucking insulting. She made me take a multi-panel drug test or leave. I left, then she called the police. Came back, smoked like 5 bowls, and took the test. I was too stoned to properly read the instructions so it became an invalid test.", "it\u2019s wonderful that it\u2019s helpful in that scenario, but the comment i was replying to was not about abusive people or situations, it was about people who default to that attitude.", "\u201cNot *every* college student!\u201d is basically the gist of your response.", "Bad bot.
