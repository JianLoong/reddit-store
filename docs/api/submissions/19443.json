The fact that the friend never paid the loans and isn't self aware enough to see that alone could damage the friendship with OP is probably the biggest factor here for me actually.

It's *never* okay though for that to happen without everyone talking it through and agreeing.", "The friend will do the work of ending the friendship if OP doesn't put out anyways.

Iirc it's never been more than about \u20ac50, an amount I could stand to lose if they wouldn't be able to repay, though so far they have always made sure to pay me back as soon as they had money coming in. We've never made it explicit and it's never come up as they've always been good about swiftly repaying, but I've always kept in mind to not loan them any more money if a previous loan wasn't yet repaid.", "So basically she is just getting further into debt by asking for more money.

Instead, if they need an amount of money and I have it and could afford to go without it, I give it to them as a gift *no strings attached* and make that absolutely clear to them, that I expect nothing back from them. If I can\u2019t, I apologize and say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I just can\u2019t afford to give it right now.

Every month, it\u2019s \u201chey, can you spare X amount.\u201d It\u2019s usually small amounts, such as $150-$300. \n\nI\u2019m a pushover, but I said no to a 90 day loan for $1500.

I am dealing with a \\*very\\* similar situation. I have offered to help her learn to budget (something that took me awhile to learn, so I get it) so that she didn't have to keep asking me or anyone else for money. She was not happy that I wouldn't give/loan her money, but I couldn't put myself at financial risk because of her decisions. You're right, being a supportive friend isn't giving her the money and enabling her, it's being willing to help her think of ways out of this habit.

Personally I think a true friend wouldn\u2019t treat their close friend like an ATM", "NTA you did not take her to raise and by now she should be getting herself straightened out.  As long as you are bailing her out she isn\u2019t going to learn.", "NTA!  Don't do it, it never ends well.  I lent money to a friend once (now ex-friend) who kept promising to pay me back and kept stalling, but always had money for new clothes, car, car accessories, etc.\n\nFinally had enough and had to get a lawyer involved.  Luckily it was documented and I had him sign off on the loan at the time I gave him the money.  Once he received the letter from the lawyer he paid up in full, but his reaction indicated that I didn't have to take it this far with threatening to sue.  This is after many years of being patient.

Please don\u2019t lend money to friends or family as it only leads to issues.", "NTA\n\nAs a personal rule, I never lend money to anyone. Thankfully I've never been asked. I don't know if I would keep a friend around who asked to borrow money, at least more than once. \"Sorry, I can't\" is a perfectly good answer that needs no further explaining.

This might be irresponsibility but it might be a genuine condition. Just my two cents. \n\nWhen I loan money to people I never expect to get it back. Money ruins relationships so unless I\u2019m willing to lose that money I don\u2019t loan it out. I would also never loan more money until the first loan was repaid.

Nope. You aren\u2019t even responsible enough to repay the small ones. And her saying that you are judgemental, unsupportive, and you should help in her time of need is a massive manipulation tactic.
