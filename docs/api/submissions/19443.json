Cross class friendships, friends who are like family, etc. However the key is in *this* friendship, there's never been an agreement to that dynamic, and it's never something to assume. The fact that the friend never paid the loans and isn't self aware enough to see that alone could damage the friendship with OP is probably the biggest factor here for me actually. I have given and received gifts and I have given and received loans. I've even had loans become gifts. It's *never* okay though for that to happen without everyone talking it through and agreeing.", "The friend will do the work of ending the friendship if OP doesn't put out anyways.

If anything it'd be reason to discuss some kind of payment plan for the amount still owed. \n\nAlso sounds like not actually much of a friend. \n\nI have one friend who occasionally (maybe 1-2x/y) asks me for a small loan to cover the last week of a particularly rough month. Iirc it's never been more than about \u20ac50, an amount I could stand to lose if they wouldn't be able to repay, though so far they have always made sure to pay me back as soon as they had money coming in. We've never made it explicit and it's never come up as they've always been good about swiftly repaying, but I've always kept in mind to not loan them any more money if a previous loan wasn't yet repaid.", "So basically she is just getting further into debt by asking for more money.
