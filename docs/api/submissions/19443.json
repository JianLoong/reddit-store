The fact that the friend never paid the loans and isn't self aware enough to see that alone could damage the friendship with OP is probably the biggest factor here for me actually.

It's *never* okay though for that to happen without everyone talking it through and agreeing.", "The friend will do the work of ending the friendship if OP doesn't put out anyways.

Iirc it's never been more than about \u20ac50, an amount I could stand to lose if they wouldn't be able to repay, though so far they have always made sure to pay me back as soon as they had money coming in. We've never made it explicit and it's never come up as they've always been good about swiftly repaying, but I've always kept in mind to not loan them any more money if a previous loan wasn't yet repaid.", "So basically she is just getting further into debt by asking for more money.

She would spend all her money on ubering burritos and weed.

She believes that having a savings account is \"hoarding wealth\" and that if you are \"rich\" by that have more money than her, you're a classest and deserve every bad thing that happens to you. Which if you're a billionaire I kinda agree, but not Joe the plumber who worked his ass off for 40 years and saved 1 mil for his retirement (i have no idea how much plumbers make but i know we just dropped $225 for under 1 hour of work fixing a sink).
