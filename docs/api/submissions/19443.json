Few people feel the need to pay things back because it is often final as in borrowing doesn\u2019t really exist, especially in some cultures but in human nature. You must be happy to give it them, borrowing is not something many humans do well. \n\nThat fixes it, if you can be happy to fuel that with no reward, then give her money. \n\nNow instead of asking for it back, you could ask what she will do in return for the money. Giving and receiving are the same thing, if she\u2019s just on the receiving end you are partaking in something which is improper. \n\nGetting her to do something meaningful could be bigger then getting her to do nothing in exchange. \n\nThat might make you feel like the Asshole, but giving and receiving go hand in hand.

As a matter of fact, she's the AH if she tries to manipulate you with the \"unsupportive friend\" bit. You can't let yourself go into financial ruin because of her poor decision making. Even if you give her money not expecting it back, it'll never stop. \n\nI fully understand as my BFF is the exact same way. She outright refuses too prioritize saving money, even with my offers to help her save and invest. She once asked me for money to help get out of a situation. I had to think about it, and the originate possibility of getting repaid (let's face it, if you're borrowing money from someone, it's because you don't know how to save money in the first place). I decided to 'lend' it to her with the full expectation that I would never see it again, so there would be no hard feelings if she didn't pay me back.

It's understandable that you, after not getting paid back after so long, more than once, are finally feeling like enough is enough.   \n\n\nI'll add, though, that it's not surprising that she lashed out defensively. A lot of people react that way when being called out on their unhealthy habits; especially if they get constructive advice about it too. So, hopefully you aren't taking it personally.", "NTA.

You have been enabling her already!  you just casually mentioned she has never returned anything you already lent her in the past!\n Now, that is not acceptable behaviour and she is using you. She is not a good friend and you need to tell her that. This is not how friendships work, that one only takes.\nIt is clear as day that she will not return any money, since she never did in the past.
