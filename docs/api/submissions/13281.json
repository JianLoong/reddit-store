Last year, we decided to move in together. In December he proposed and I was over the moon! One of the things I adore about Marc is that he's an *incredible* chef, so I was pretty excited to spend more time cooking meals together. Unfortunately, that's no longer happening. \n\nI am an athlete and have maintained essentially the same weight since I was a teen. I don't closely track calories, but I am pretty conscientious about what I put into my body and Marc and I try to cook healthy (most of the time!) I don't weigh myself regularly, but I could tell something was wrong when my body started looking much softer late last year. My diet and exercise routine hadn't really changed. I stepped on the scale and nearly cried when I discovered I had gained almost twenty pounds since I last checked in. I immediately took three pregnancy tests. Thankfully, they were negative. \n\nAt first, I thought maybe I had actually just overdone it through the holidays and not noticed. I started skipping breakfast and logging every single thing I ate and was floored when the scale didn't budge. I was so afraid that something was seriously wrong I booked a doctor's appointment. They ran some bloodwork, checked my thyroid, and a number of other things (yet another pregnancy test - yay) but they all came back completely normal. \n\nI was at my breaking point. Instagram had started serving me nonstop \"detox,\" fitness, meal prep, and pharmaceutical weight loss content. It was driving me insane. I decided I was going to eliminate myself as a variable, so I signed up for one of those healthy meal service delivery kits with pre-portioned meals. Marc found the box before I did and went BALLISTIC. He started yelling about how I was being irresponsible with my money, how it's such a waste, terrible for the environment, and how I thought I was \"too good for his cooking.\"\n\nWhile we don't actually pool finances at the moment, we generally run larger purchases and big commitments by each other. I didn't mention the meal service kit because I can easily afford it and, on some level, I knew Marc would be really disappointed that I didn't want to cook with him anymore. I don't want to eat this stuff forever (it's SO bland and boring!) but the weight has finally started falling off.

OP, have you heard of orthorexia?  I think you should look it up and decide if it sounds like you. Eating a healthy diet is obviously important, but the way you talk about your food tracking, weight gain, and meal skipping doesn't sound completely healthy.\n\nObviously this is one post and I could be totally off. But, if you feel like it might apply to you, I encourage you to speak to your doctor.\n\nI don't think anyone is TA here. It seems like you're both still learning to communicate with each other. Tell your fiance how you're feeling and have a calm conversation", "Sigh. Lemme start with this: weighing more than you did as a teen when you\u2019re 27 is completely normal.  You weren\u2019t done developing as a teen.  The idea that you need to maintain the same weight your entire life is unhealthy and unrealistic.\n\nThe other thing I want to say is that temporary measures = temporary weight loss.  If you don\u2019t plan to eat this food forever, you will gain the weight back.  Guaranteed. \n\nThe only thing I will judge on is that meals and finances are two things that are a pretty big part of life together for partners.  Ordering a meal kit service just for you without talking about it with your partner is just not a good move, financially or relationship-wise.  I think you\u2019d have done better to talk with him about some small and sustainable changes you can make together that can be kept up long term.  YTA for not considering him in the decision.", "ESH\n\nBut... have you considered that in your late 20s, your metabolism starts slowing down from the teenage insanity and that's just... being a human and not the end of the world?", "NAH. Welcome to being almost thirty. Hope you like ibuprofen. \n\nCommunicate about it. You both enjoy spending time together and cooking delicious food. You also want to stay skinny. Those don't have to be mutually exclusive.\n\nMy take? As long as you're within a healthy weight range, putting on some weight and eating good food together is the sign of a happy marriage. It becomes very difficult to keep the same weight into your thirties living in the US and you'll start finding wrinkles and grey hair not much later, so don't sweat it.\n\nMake healthy choices, but enjoy life too.", "ESH\n\nIf someone is cooking for you, it\u2019s polite to let them know you\u2019ve made other arrangements for your meals, preferably before they do planning and shopping for the week.\n\nBut screaming at you is highly inappropriate. Makes me wonder why he feels so strongly about it.", "INFO: are there changes your SO can make to his meals to make them healthier? Less butter, more air fryer, etc?", "Call me old fashioned, but if you are invested in a relationship then why the heck aren't you invested in honesty with your partner?    If broaching the topic is that incendiary...then maybe reconsider that whole \"fiance\" thing...\n\nHe is a chef in your words.  \"Chef\" in literal terms means \"chief.\"   Your attribution of expertise sets you up to feel inferior.\n\nJust tell him your dietary needs/wants.  No need to make it personal.\n\nBut...backtracking to the original question.  Yes.  You are the AH for purchasing  meals behind his back before having any conversation about it.  If, as you say, such things get \"ballistic\" then why the Heck are you still in that scenario, never mind planning to (IMO) \"future divorce\" him?", "ESH. Honestly I'd be upset too if my live-in partner decided that they were gonna start eating all their meals separately from me, especially if I was cooking for or with them on a regular basis. Did you ever talk to him about your concerns with his food possibly making you gain weight? It sounds like you blindsided him with this because you knew he wouldn't like it, which isn't great communication. If you don't feel comfortable talking to him about this stuff then you most likely have bigger problems than just the scale.", "\nIt\u2019s normal to gain weight as you age.

Oh, and weight gain, that is genetics and physiology.  Your BMR slows as you age.  Try weighing your food to enforce portion control.", "NTA. But yknow youre contradicting yourself right, or were you being sarcastic when you called him an incredible chef?\n\nHe's wrong for screaming at you but i feel like if cooking and eating together is your big bonding moment then you should have definitely talked to him about it first.\n\nIts normal for our bodies to not be able to stay as fit as we easily did when we were younger. Its part of growing old. Maybe you should have twlked to him first and let him know you wanna lose some weight, and that you want to try different flavor profiles.\n\nIf i was your partner i might be offended and give you a slient treatment but imo shouting at you was too much.", "ESH\n\n> I didn't mention the meal service kit because I can easily afford it and, on some level, I knew Marc would be really disappointed that I didn't want to cook with him anymore.\n\nThis is obviously selfish and cowardly behavior.\n\nWhen you find yourself sneaking around behind your partner\u2019s back because you don\u2019t want to deal with their feelings, it\u2019s probably time to question whether you should be in this relationship.\n\nBut his response sounds a bit extreme.", "YTA. You are putting unreasonable expectations on your body. You should be talking to a nutritionist/ dietician (which one has a degree? I forget but go\nTo that one) and have a professional give oversight to your diet:  a meal kit is just another gimmick diet and you fell for it.\n\nAlso, after four years together, you and your fianc\u00e9e have built a food culture and love language around shared food. You chucked it out the window for a gimmick .\n\nWas it worth it?", "NTA, but\u2026\n\nYou probably should\u2019ve talked with him about it before you started ordering meal kits. Maybe there\u2019s a way he could\u2019ve changed his cooking so you wouldn\u2019t gain weight.", "NTA. At the end of the day, his cooking wasn't meeting your needs. There's some red flags here too:\n\n- No doubt he knew what was happening with your body, but you had to try and hide the meal kit from him. \n\n- He went ballistic and yelled over a delivered box of food? You need to evaluate if you're willing to live like this indefinitely. His response was not reasonable and you should be allowed to make some decisions about YOUR health and YOUR body without being worried about his reaction.", "NTA, and I'm... concerned that he might be intentionally sabotaging you. His anger at losing control over what you eat might indicate something like that.", "NAH \n\nI love to cook so I have used my cooking abilities to make really healthy and relatively low calorie stuff. One of the greatest things about cooking at home is that you can make wonderful tasty food without all the oil and sugar of restaurant dishes.\n\nWhy don't you sit down and discuss changing the recipes the two of you make most nights and save the high calorie stuff for once a week or so.\n\nIn terms of health and long term weight control, it is better to change cooking and eating habits rather than relying solely on \"props\" like delivered food which aren't sustainable for a lifetime. If you get a repertoire of good healthy food, then you are set for a lifetime.", "NTA, the only difference is you're eating Marc's cooking. He's fattening you up.", "Well, it's for sure your decision what you put in your body. But in a normal relationship people discuss these things with each other?! Why have you not asked him to change his recipes or something? \n\nAlso, at one point you say he is an incredible chef and then call his many boring? Doesn't make sense. \n\nLast point, at around 30 the metabolism changes and even if you eating the same, you will gain weight.

I would say NTA, but talk to you SO.", "NTA \n\nSounds like he\u2019s intentionally sabotaging you", "NTA, I\u2019m also an athlete and have been meal prepping because i gained too much and need to drop it by summer. if i had the money and less allergies, i\u2019s totally go that route", "It could very well be that he's been feeding you rich foods on purpose to make you gain weight. Insecure men like their women heavier so that they are not as attractive to other men. That would explain why he went BALLISTIC.\n\nWatch out and see if he tries to sabotage your weight loss program. If so, RED FLAG.\n\nI kept my 20 yr old weight up until my 40's. I had no kids, was very active, and didn't indulge in booze or sugar.

What does this mean then? As soon as you stop the service and go back to your fiance's meals then you'll gain the weight back. If I was in Marc's shoes, someone who cooks all these amazing meals for you, is ENGAGED to you, and just finds a meal delivery service box without context, I'd be pissed too. Should he go ballistic? Probably not, however he is right to be mad.

Marc is not an asshole for being upset you decided to stop participating in one of your couple activities, though he responded way too harshly, lashing out because you hurt his feelings. I\u2019m not gonna call you an asshole either because you have some serious body image issues and need therapy beyond what Reddit can provide, and your actions are due to mental distress and not directly harming anyone other than yourself. But I think you should try to stop fixating on maintaining the same weight as when you were a teenager with a naturally high metabolism and weren\u2019t fully developed, and try to actually enjoy your life.

The way OP talks about food and being an athlete and everything sounds a lot like me when I was living with an eating disorder. I'll put it bluntly, I was not healthy. I was not healthy mentally, I was not healthy physically and I think at times it did affect my relationship with my long time partner in negative ways.

Does she need to inform him every time she decides to eat out too? \n\nYes i agree it would've been better to talk to him first but him going \"ballistic\" over it because of his ego is insane and makes him an asshole.

You should *want* to tell them what's going on with you, whether it's something joyful or something you're struggling with. \n\nIf you just want to live in the same house as someone and occasionally have sex with them but otherwise not really interact with them that's cool, many different relationship styles are valid, but that's not how most people see romantic relationships and it's very far from the default expectation. \n\nOP isn't an asshole for making a major change in what was previously a joint cooking-and-eating routine without talking to her boyfriend beforehand, but it's *really fucking weird*.

I mean, yes, we all gain weight as we age, but OP sounds like they know their own body, exercise and eating habits well enough to be surprised and concerned about their seemingly inexplicable weight gain.

He's the cat you should have enlisted early on. \n\nYou're in the midst of getting ready to get married and share your lives, and your MEALS have to go behind his back? \n\nI mean, not the biggest AH on the team, but kinda an AH move.", "NTA and so many of these comments are absolutely bonkers. \nFirst, there is nothing wrong with wanting to maintain a certain physical appearance/ weight. I am over 35 and I weigh as much right now as I did when I was 19, and Im actually more physically healthy and I overall look better than I did at 19. This is because two years ago i also stood on a scale and was shocked that I gained 20 pounds. It took me about a year to lose it all, and it was not easy. The hardest part was counting calories and macros accurately, and doing a ton of meal prep. The main reason I think I managed it was because it was COVID and I didn't have to go into work. Having a meal kit service would have been so much easier. \n\nSecond, I also get why committing to a meal kit is hard. I love cooking and sharing meals with my partner, it's fun, it's bonding, and all that. But switching to a meal kit isn't a huge life altering decision, honestly in the grand scheme of things it's just not a big deal at all. At most you have slightly inconvenienced him, because now he will have to cook only for himself but again, not a big deal, he can learn to cook smaller portions or eat leftovers or whatever. Which brings me to my last point...\n\nHe went ballistic? Over a meal kit? Really? What kind of an adult loses his mind because of someone else's food choices/dietary preferences? An appropriate reaction might have been to say \"I wish you would have discussed this with me first \" but actually raising his voice at you over a meal kit (he isn't even paying for)? Did you notice how he also made your decision regarding your health all about him with the \"too good for his cooking\" comment? \n\nHave you disagreed with him about things before? Or been in a low/medium stakes situation where you want A and he wants B? Does he frequently respond by raising his voice, trying to shame you, or twisting the situation around to make himself a victim when really there are no victims and it's simply a differece of opinion? Just something to consider.\nGood luck on your weight loss journey! You can do it!\n\nEdit: forgot to add: there is also nothing wrong with accepting our bodies as they naturally change over time. Being able to maintain a young adult weight into adulthood is based on many many factors, it's not possible or practical for  everyone. But for some people it's possible and they make it a priority which is also okay.", "Why is it ESH? What\u2019s wrong with her wanting to eat a meal service?", "I'm glad I found your comment because I'm also wondering if he's tampering with her food. It's weird that this started happening after they moved in together and she refers to him as the chef. Call me paranoid but I'd put a hidden camera in the kitchen just to relieve myself of the anxiety of wondering.", "I think it\u2019s more likely there have been lifestyle changes but they\u2019ve been more of a creep than a cliff.", "Man I totally thought the same thing. The strange situation coupled with his angry response seems way off.", "Overfeeding doesn\u2019t equate to overeating and overeating isn\u2019t the same as consuming calorie-dense meals. You can\u2019t typically overfeed an adult, but many adults overeat. And you can eat a totally normal sized meal that\u2019s too rich for weight maintenance. It\u2019s easy to conflate various eating behaviors and nutritional situations but it\u2019s important to understand them. Dietitians are a wonderful tool that are often covered by insurance as preventive care; OP should start there.", "Bro I'm mid 30s and apart from myself getting my foot/lower leg amputated due to diabetes, I'm perfectly healthy and don't need ibuprofen. If you're taking it daily at that age maybe talk to a doctor?", "It\u2019s ESH because she didn\u2019t communicate any of this anxiety and attempts to change things since last year. That\u2019s not great for their relationship.", "It\u2019s probably just because he cooks with a lot of actual butter. Restaurant food uses more fat than most people do at home cooking. This is why it\u2019s delicious.", "It starts to slow & change with age, and there is a thing called relationship weight.  I was 120 at 18, and I was 135 at 25 years, and I walked everywhere in college. And here's an extra bit too, hangovers are going to be terrible, and your back is going to hurt if you sleep on the couch.  You are reaching midlife, and this is inevitable.", "Weight gain is not inevitable. Losing the ability to maintain weight without being careful about your lifestyle is inevitable.", "The fact that Marc went ballistic and is the meal provider makes me super nervous.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to spend your money however you like. You don\u2019t need his permission to make purchases. \n\nYou avoided telling him about the purchase. Was it because you (correctly) feared an outsized reaction? Does he often blow up when you exercise autonomy?\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t accept partners who insult and berate me. If you don\u2019t either, he shouldn\u2019t get upgraded from fianc\u00e9 to husband.", "My partner ( now ex) was deliberately putting sugar in my tea instead of stevia. He would mix it with alittle stevia so I could see the empty packet and believe it was stevia. I was prediabetic . \nNTA. You look after your health. There are some crazies out there.", "ESH.\n\nFor many people, cooking is a love language. The process of planning a meal together, shopping for ingredients, cooking it together, eating together, even the division of chores for cleaning up ... each of these tasks provide opportunities for conversations, familiar interactions, moments of everyday intimacy. It's all a love language. \n\nGetting a meal kit essentially sends the message you no longer wants to engage in these domestic activities together. \n\nThat said, should BF communicate his frustration and hurt at what could clearly be perceived as his partner pulling away/ putting up an emotional wall in a rational and adult manner? Oh, definitely. Any time \"going ballistic,\" is used to describe a guy expressing his emotions, it's a bad situation.", "YTA for not talking to your fiance before making a purchase like that when you previously talked about those things.", "ESH\n\nHim for blowing up. You, for this:\n\n>> I didn\u2019t mention the meal service kit because (\u2026) I knew Marc would be really disappointed that I didn\u2019t want to cook with him anymore.\n\nCooking, it appears, was your quality time together. A fun activity to do together. You made a decision that you\u2019re not going to participate in quality time anymore (that\u2019s ok) but you didn\u2019t let him know (that\u2019s the AH part).", "NTA\n\nThis is an investment in your relationship and you should tell your fiance so. \n\nIf you are an athlete you are more likely to feel uncomfortable in your body when your weight or shape changes. And if one partner feels bad about themself, this is like never a good thing for a relationship, especially if the thing that got you out of shape is your partners cooking. \n\nYou spotted your problem and are trying to solve it as fast as possible. That means you can't eat his meals for a short time. \n\nIf he cares about your happiness he shouldn't take it personally. \n\nInfo: what body type is your fiance? Is he an athlete too?", "/r/loseit is an important resource as you may not be well informed about how to sustainably eat for a weight you are happy with.\n\nESH though...you should have communicated with the person you *are living with* but his reaction is completely irrational too. There are larger issues going on here.", "Totally. He cooks differently than she used to eat. 27YOs can absolutely weigh the same as 18YOs. I was in better shape in my late 20s-early 30s than as a teen. \n\nWhat kills ya is having children. Love 'em, but they 100% change a woman's body. \n\nAnd turning 40.\n\nBeing 27, not so much. He's using more fat/sugar/calorie-dense food than she's used to.", "She doesn't have body issues. She wants the same body as she had a year ago. And EVERY professional will tell you to look at your caloric intake using a tracking app. that's how you figure out where you got off track.\n\nI think it's pretty simple that the culprit is BF's cooking. If she's not cooking, who knows how much fats he using to cook, or if he's using calorie-dense ingredients as opposed to how she cooked solo. She's too young for her metabolism to slow down since what - December?", "Thank you! OP, NTA. Marc is messing with your food.", "The bland and boring comment is about the mealkit food, not about the food her bf makes", "\"I don't want to eat **this** stuff forever (it's SO bland and boring!) but the weight has finally started falling off.\"\n\nThe meal service is bland, not Marc's food.", "Why can\u2019t she talk to her partner about her concerns and ask him to cook meals with weight loss in mind instead of chasing fad diets and skipping breakfast? Did she talk to him at all about any of this, because it feels like no.", "Because you're supposed to TALK to your life partner.", "What? Why? I\u2018m 45 and I take maybe three a year? Do you hate your kidneys?", "So you're comparing current you, a physically mature adult with responsibilities, full time job, hobbies, interests, commitments, stressors, etc. against teenage you, who was physically still developing, at school, training for athletics, being supported and looked after by parents....\n\nOf course the weight is going to be different.", "I'm afraid this just isn't true. In general, women's bodies get a bit rounder in our late 20s.", "Really!! That much ibuprofen will cause kidney damage."]}
