It's more like a casual step.", "They're called predictive indicators and professionals use them all the time for predicting how criminals act down to how people prefer to shop in grocery stores based on where they live lol", "NTA\n\nBut\n\nYou paint a house purple and you call white with black trim \u201cgaudy \u201c\n\nYou do you, man, but that\u2019s an odd way to describe it.", "... my house is purple so automatically NTA.\n\nSeriously though, it's your house and your choice. My neighborhood is filled with houses that are painted in a bunch of bright colors. My house is light purple, across the street my neighbors have a dark purple house. There's a yellow house, a green house, several blue houses, and even a bright orange house a few blocks down. The variety lifts the whole neighborhood up, makes it feel homey and friendly, and certainly doesn't tank the resale value of anyone's home. And even if it did, who cares? It's your house!", "NTA. Sounds like your dad and bro has some toxic masculinity going on. Their way is the right way and they are trying to prevent you from making a mistake. -_- \n\nYou're a grown adult you can paint the house any color you want. They aint paying for the mortgage.\n\n Your dad and brother sounds like the dudes who think they have to mansplain things to women even though said women is an expert on the subject with books and papers to back her up. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI had an ex similar to them.  It is insufferable living with them cuz everything has to be done their way and only their way is right.", "You\u2019re doing your niece a favor if she doesn\u2019t have to go to a religious school", "NTA it\u2019s literally YOUR house?? They don\u2019t get to be upset over how you want to make your personal space suited to what you want, a purple house is so cool", "There are some neighborhoods, and houses, that call for a bright house color. There's one of the townships on Martha's Vineyard in which these small cottages have the wildest paint combos - it's such a happy place. (Meanwhile, nearby on Nantucket, you have a choice of 3 colors).\n\nI am not a fan of white and grey everywhere and your color scheme made me grin.\n\nNTA", "NTA and I just spent waaaaaay too much time on Google images looking at houses painted this colour! Every one of them looked stunning.", "NTA - Your house, your decor. Whatever you like. \n\nAlso, you are not responsible for your brother's family vacations.

Vacations are still pretty common.", "In case anyone is curious, [this](https://youtu.be/p7YXXieghto) is the shade of purple that OP is painting his house.", "[removed]", "I thought they called the previous owner a dipshit because the previous owners were house flippers.\n\nHouse flipping is a plague and people who do it for a living are fucking terrible. Hence, dipshits.", "I'm pretty sure she warned them, and they doubled down. Also, vacations being common depends very much on where you live. Some countries and some jobs have longer holidays than others.", "The idea that I wouldn't be able to find someone who wants a purple house is REALLY funny.", "I looked at the color she mentioned, and its pretty close to the color of my house. Nor garish at all, it was this color when I bought it, and the whole neighborhood was built in the 70s. Very classic.\n\nBut I did get annoyed at OPs rant at the beginning. I also hate the beige on grey on white trend thats happening, and I think the trend of painting brick will be remembered similarly to the 80s and 90s trend of carpeting over hardwood, but it's a trend because a lot of people like it. There's a way to say \"X is more my taste\" instead of insulting the design you don't like. Seems like OPs entire family is like that.", "Sure, although I just read as OP throwing out words. Didn't assume she actually meant flippers. I'd imagine she never even met them and was throwing abuse at random people.", "Almost as funny as you living somewhere where you don't have enough space for a lawn and garden lmao", "House we lived in most of my childhood was constantly modified.  Started with 3 bedrooms on top floor.   When my younger sisters came along, other sister and I got our own rooms built in the basement.\n\nThe, parents knocked out a wall, gave them a huge bedroom.    Few years later, parents turned rec room into a bedroom and a separate \"piano\" room.  That fucking piano.  \n\nWall between kitchen and dining room was removed at one point, too.\n\n2 different garage/shop expansions, too.\n\nThe sheer amount of manipulation that went into who got teh \"big\" room was insane, btw.", "A lot of flippers ruin old houses, especially when they remove original features. If you have a historic home, it's an absolute headache to restore them after a flip.\n\nConsidering how colorful the neighborhood the house is in, this sounds like the flipper didn't know what they were getting into.", "It\u2019s not the flipper\u2019s aesthetic that OP is reacting to\u2014it\u2019s the grey design trend that took over the US in the past 10 years.  Every new construction home, flipped house, or house prepared for market by a realtor is the same\u2014light grey walls, grey-washed flooring, etc\u2014and everyone\u2019s painting their brick houses white with black accents.  It\u2019s a horrid, soulless trend.  There were three houses built on an empty lot in my neighborhood over the past few years, and they are all the same white-painted brick with black trim.  OP is rejecting HGTV\u2019s aesthetic.", "It was a nice gesture that she asked them. Your house can affect the value of other houses.", "Oh that's fair. I assumed she meant actual flippers because that bullshit is so common these days. Everyone out to make a quick buck, at the expense of someone else. I hate it. Housing is not a commodity. Housing is not an investment. Housing should be a human fucking right.", "Op can change their mind can't they?\n\nPublic school is an option, isn't it?", "are you aware of what the real estate market looks like right now? because a purple house is going to fly off the market the same way as something painted a trendy white with black trim. it's not expensive to repaint a house.", "Oh, I think you missed the point. People in this neighborhood don't do the whole grass lawn thing. They do gardens instead. Flower gardens, veg gardens, pollinator gardens. There's plenty of room, they just choose to use the space differently.", "Why? Also how do you know they don't plan on this being their \"forever home\"?\n\n\"There's more to life\"  -- exactly! There is so much more to life than compliance with bullshit standards that you don't agree with. If you don't like it, don't do it! As long as no one else is being physically harmed (fuck your property values), then you do you and everyone else can stfu. \n\nIt's the colour of a house... why is this even a conversation beyond, \"does it make you happy?\" \"Good.\"", "If the dog is behaved, you would never even know since the seller isn't allowed to be present when buyers are walking through.", "When we were looking to buy I rejected a ton of homes with new kitchens, because the kitchens were clearly put in for \u201dresale value\u201d just before sale instead of being a kitchen made to live in and use. I refused to pay more for a property because someone put in a modern looking kitchen quickly that\u2019s impractical because they didn\u2019t care because they were leaving anyway. Nope. \n\nDoes my house need a new kitchen? Yes, but when we re-do it I\u2019ll get exactly what I want.", "You'd probably like the Candelaria in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia then.\n\nMost houses are colourful and covered in impressive graffiti murals.", "A lot of not Catholic people send their kid to those schools because they don't like the public ones in their area and other private schools are too expensive.", "Lol, back in the 2000s a huge mall opened in my city. \n\nThey made this TV ad of a guy in a beige bathroom, checking the walls, curtains, etc and saying \"beige, beige\" at each.

Then starts checking again \"beige, beige, beige...\" and falls dead.\n\nVoiceover: \"8, 9 and up to 10 out of ten people are dying of boredom\".\n\nIt wasn't that good, but the dude just dropping after being beiged out remains with me to this day.", "You can reject an aesthetic without sounding like a complete jerk, or making character judgements on people based on their taste. I don't see how \"people who like neutral colours are living boring, soulless lives\" is any better than \"people who like vibrant colours are immature children\".", "Nah, you need at least a half-bath in a 2-story house, at least if you ever have company. I\u2019m disabled& walk with a cane, so stairs are not only extremely difficult for me but also dangerous because my left foot is partially paralyzed. Granted, I\u2019m never visiting your house, but can you be certain no one with mobility issues, like aging parents, will?!", "Nice to ask, but if they say no... fuck em! Why is everyone so worried about fuxking property value? Fuck it and focus on enjoying your life in your new home... worry about reselling later.

We did a dragon mural for my son's room, and it really wasn't difficult to do.", "Not so good when you rent, though.  Neighbour had shit hanging from walls and ceiling everywhere.

Boom. Purple = gay. \n\nNot that people who associate purple with being gay are going to make that connection, but it\u2019s there, if you *really* stretch it.\n\nAnd as someone who lives in an HOA neighborhood of beige and greige houses, I *really* wish I could do what my parents did, and get ultra-dark blue siding. It looks amazing.", "No, you can't.\n\nNone of those mean homophobia separately, they aren't going to add together to mean it, either.\n\nEven your example of internet, liking guns, and liking WW2 history means nothing, bud.  that's delusional level thinking when you start tying together random shit and deciding it is a meaningful pattern.\n\nfuck's sake - did OP even say they aren't straight?", "Going to a Catholic school has nothing to do with this. Sounds like a \u201cyou\u201d problem.", "Like I said, not liking purple houses, sending a kid to Catholic school, or thinking somebody needs to grow up aren't predictive indicators of homophobia.\n\nProfessionals look for actual signs of stuff, they don't just decide random things show homophobia.", "Except if I add young and male to that list, they become one of the main predictors of white supremacist terrorism. To the point that we (in Denmark) have charged people matching this characteristic. So it's not out of my ass. Government agencies use these specifically, bud.\n\nGranted, what I mean with this is, the case for OP's father and brother being homophobes, is not completely out of left field. Is it enough for a final judgment? No. But it does mean I'd want evidence of the contrary, if I were to interact with these people in real life, or let them be around kids in my care. Something which could easily be clarified by asking OP's Father and brother: \"how do you feel about gay people?\"", "I think it's fair to agree to disagree. :)"]}
