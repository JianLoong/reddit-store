You can't possibly make it yours because what happens when you want to move in 10 years?\n\nPaint it purple. Sucks about vacation but enjoy that new house.", "NTA. Color is a personal choice. If you are following the local laws and ordinances, then paint away. Your father and brother may have a valid point about resale value but since it\u2019s not their house, they get no vote. As far as your nieces tuition goes, surely they had to know that eventually your support would come to an end when your expenses warranted. Today is that day.", "NTA and WTF are you paying for the tuition for someone else's kid? Leave that to the parents.", "NTA. Especially if its an exterior. Professional painter and daughter to a real estate agent here. I would have two thoughts about purple: if its a deep base or clear base colour, I would do a basecoat of grey over the white before the purple to make sure you get good coverage. Second, worry about colours for re-sale when you are ready to sell your home. Exterior wood should be painted every 5 years or so (depending on wear) so you shoupd have plenty of time to enjoy your house looking the way you want.", "Nta. You house you choose colour and the neighbours don't have problems with this . And for money if they don't run their mouth you will have money to help them so you don't need to feel bad about their vacation.", "NTA, and I'm incredibly jealous of the amazing neighborhood you are living in.", "We're lucky if we get 80 years on this fucking planet, so why should we spend that time worrying about whether other people think our awesome purple house is \"childish\" or not? I think it's really sad that your dad and brother are spending the only precious life they have bound to some arbitrary, ridiculous, and socially fabricated beige existence.\n\n\n\n\nNTA your house sounds awesome!", "NTA.

Also I am a purpleholic and think there should be more purple in the world. Also you nieces educational funds are none of your problems.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA - This is the same color I wanted to paint my little house.  It would have been so cut, like a quaint garden home.  Hubby talked me out of it to put siding on instead, yea it will.last longer but... Good for you to sticking with it!", "NTA. Your house, your money, your choice. \n\nAlso, stop paying for their yearly vacations.", "NTA the house is now your home now so do whatchu want as long as there is no HOA.. But remember to beige it out when you eventually resell, it helps to make it more marketable to more prospective buyers. The basic blank canvas makes it much easier to visualize what you can do to make it yours, loud more personal choices in colors and decor are usually distracting and can be off-putting to potential buyer's.", "NTA, and the audacity of mocking and belittling a person contributing to your kids tuition.\n\nYou better than me bc I would've told your brother to grow t.f and take care of his child's needs on his own.

Correct action by your dad:\n\n\"Son, have you thought about the colour and what it might do to resale value? Have you thought about how you might get sick of such a strong colour yourself? Oh, you have? Okay, great.

If not, seems a little harsh to refuse free!! Labour!! Over an argument, you have to agree that purple isn\u2019t the most conventional colorv that men with the \u201cHGTV resale value\u201d mindset like to see, but then you mentioned them wanting you to save the money to pay for your nieces tuition??? So they can afford vacation??? That\u2019s insane, NTA specifically for that, if their bugging you to pay for tuition for a kid that\u2019s not even yours then your immediately justified for any favors your rejecting, good for you!", "Ya\u2019ll sound like mean, rude, enmeshed, immature assholes really.   \n\n\nPaint your house and be done with it.
