They would paint her house and as payment for their time and effort she would cover education costs for the niece. It's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.

It'll likely be a work in progress for the rest of my husband and my lives. \n\n Not feeling comfortable and at home in my surroundings tanks my mental health.  I need my home to have personal touches.  Our home is a reflection of our family.  This house is so much more than just a house, it's our home.  That's incredibly important to me.
