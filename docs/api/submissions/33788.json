What if Aunt Edna became upset because she wanted to be involved in your kids' lives?  Wouldn't you tell her she *can*; just not with Louie and she can't espouse Trumpism?\n\nIf your brother and parents believe homosexual relationships are wrong, it makes sense they would try to keep their children from being overly exposed to it.  They aren't assholes for believing what they believe and teaching their children what they think is right.  If your parents agree with that position, it makes sense they would support it.\n\nI know this is an unpopular opinion; particularly on Reddit.

If they are there, I\u2019m not. Two exceptions have been a funeral and a major illness, where the person still treats me like shit and my parents still do **nothing** to support me.

You can make them afraid to tell you how they believe.  But in their minds, they will believe what they believe.  OP's brother and parents believe OP's relationship is wrong.  OP can't change that.  The only question is whether OP, or anyone, should be entitled to force OP's brother and parents to live contrary to the way they believe they should live."]}
