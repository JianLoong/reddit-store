His reasoning is that his children (ages 5 - 11) were too young to understand what being gay meant, and that he didn\u2019t want them to see our sinful relationship as \u201cnormal.\u201d He said that if I wanted to spend time with my nieces and nephews, I had to attend family gatherings alone and without my girlfriend. He told me that if I ever showed up with her, he would cut me out of their lives forever. \n\nI asked if there was any room for compromise, because I wanted to be a part of my nieces and nephews lives but would not do so while leaving my partner at home alone during birthdays/holidays/etc. He would not compromise and said the kids would not be allowed around us until they were older (he did not specify how much older). I said if that was the case I would no longer be attending family gatherings, and I\u2019ve stuck to my word. \n\nFast forward, now my parents host multiple Christmas celebrations and birthday parties because of this situation, and often my brother will call or text my parents to make sure my fianc\u00e9e and I are leaving or have left before he leaves the house with his wife and kids to come over for \u201csecond\u201d Christmas, etc. My family (parents, other sibs) say I\u2019m making the choice not to be together because I\u2019m still welcome as long as I show up alone.

My wife and I are about to celebrate 29 years together (I\u2019m a woman), and spent Christmas with my sister, her wife, my elderly mother, and exchanged calls with my brother and his wife, as they were too sick to make it this year. That\u2019s what you deserve. Was it perfect at the beginning? Nope. But my brother actually sat my parents down and lit into them about it almost 30 years ago, and they really turned a corner. Before he died, my dad was a great advocate. So maybe for you it needs to be the opposite. Your family members need to sit your brother down and tell him to knock it off. \n\nFYI, religious people by far are more responsible for child molestation, and lesbians are by far the least likely to harm children of any other group.", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother is. Your relationship is normal and his kids should be exposed to any loving relationship, whether it be homosexual or heterosexual.", "NTA. Just cut your toxic family off.", "NTA.

Personally, I'd make plans to do something special with your GF, but make a stop at the house when the brother's kids are there and tell them that you are in love with a woman, and because of this their father will not allow them to see you ever again. Walk out and never return to these toxic, hate fulled bigots. They may be your relatives, but they are not your family. Anyone who does not accept you as you are without reservations does not love you. You deserve better.", "NTA.  I suppose your brother is a \"good Christian\" while he still acts like a putz and hates people who are different.   This is on him,  not you and I think it's great that you stand up for your partner.", "NTA. But your situation will most likely not change. \n\nYou just need to decide if having your partner attached to your hip even at family functions is worth never being together as a family again. \n\nI won\u2019t say you\u2019re a black sheep but you are the odd man out. Mad props to your parents for doing everything they can to love their kids as equally as possible even if no one else will help them. \n\nTry not to be too hard on them. Them forcing their son over with your gf there is a kin to them forcing her not to be there for him while you\u2019re there. \n\nI hope your brother finds somewhere in his mind to accept your relationship while preserving his own personal family values.", "LOL NTA your brother is a closet case and can't stand to see you and your GF open and happy and not being repressed AH's.

They only want you around on their terms and restrict your lifestyle. This is not a good family and I'd never go around them if I were you.", "NTA. Your family doesn't support your relationship.

My children have only ever seen him with male partners. My children attended his wedding when they were 10 and 7. \u201cThe Uncles,\u201d as we collectively refer to them, attend a weekly dinner at our home and we play board games, watch movies, have bon fires and all sorts of things together. \n\nYour brother is an actual bigot trying to pretend he isn\u2019t by using his kids for cover. My kids understand that families look all sorts of ways. It can easily be argued that, if you want to shield your children from gay relationships because they can\u2019t understand them, that you better be prepared to hide divorce from them too. Isn\u2019t that pretty sinful? How could they possibly understand the concept of step-parents or shared custody? What if they see obese people? Gluttony is a deadly sin, homosexuality isn\u2019t even on that list! How will the children ever understand!?!\n\nYou are NTA. However, you don\u2019t have to sit in a room full of bigots every holiday season either.", "Ask them to EXPLAIN THOROUGHLY WHY it's ok for brother to make DEMANDS about guests in THEIR HOME.

Ask them to EXPLAIN THOROUGHLY what will happen after you and your fianc\u00e9e marry will they BAN their daughter in law? Will they go to your wedding if your brother says no. Ask them to EXPLAIN THOROUGHLY how YOU are causing any rifts. You are not the one making any demands on guest lists to OTHER PEOPLE'S EVENTS. You just are NOT going to have your fianc\u00e9e disrespected. Tell them you will NOT have your FUTURE WIFE disrespected. Tell them you will accept leaving your future wife at home when they will make BROTHER'S WIFE unwelcome. You're NTA. however I really think  you should reconsider how close a relationship with your parents you should have. Will they come to wedding? Will they continue to disrespect your fianc\u00e9e once you get married? If you have children what will their behaviour be? I think brother is their golden child.", "NTA You are not the one making the choice to keep the families separate. That is on your brother. Your parents should be lecturing him and leaving you alone. It's wonderful that you are refusing to allow them to erase your partner.", "NTA. you are not the one issuing the ultimatum, you are not the one making the choice to uphold this ridiculous rule. Your brother chose not to be together when he started threatening to cut contact, and he is the only one continuing to choose not to be together.

Your brother is obviously a bigot and they're pretending that's reasonable. I'd probably cut them all off until they admit there's nothing wrong with your relationship\nYou're NTA", "I agree, it\u2019s the brother - has nothing to do with the children. The two children are too young to realize they are partners and not just friends.", "You should not hope that one of his kids is going to be isolated, shunned, and likely abused.", "I'd like to clap at your comment. It's a perfect solution. The only thing I disagree with would be inflicting the terrible brother and SIL on a gay child. The child doesn't deserve that.", "Gay people are normal people. I hope no one ever mistakes me for \"normal\" people.", "Also, your family needs to stop holding multiple events because of him. He either gets his shit together and shows up or he doesn\u2019t get to go.", "Agree. Can she bring up 'sue' and her saw a movie without a dirty look or further condemnation from brother?  It's not worth it. Christmas eve small gathering with parents and to siblings that say 'well, you can still come, it's your choice'. I'd reply ' not in the form of an ultimatum to cut children from grandparents and siblings from each other. That's a hate ultimatum, not a holiday family gathering of peace and joy.' NTA", "The only thing worthwhile in the comment is the first sentence, NTA, your situation will most likely not change.\n\nYou do not have to decide whether you want your partner attached at the hip and give up being together as a family, because this is not a family, this is a group of people who are genetically related. Family loves unconditionally.\n\nParents enabling a bigot son are not doing a good job, they deserve no props at all.\n\nYou are not being hard on anyone. They have rejected you. Do not go where you and the person you love are not welcome together.", "Brother is probably favourite. And since OP'S gay they think grandkids are off the table.", "If the child is born that way there is nothing a person can do to change them. This may help the parents become more acceptable to gay people and see they are not evil people. God made them that way and there is nothing wrong with them.", "OP's brother was the one who said their relationship isn't \"normal\", I was suggesting one way to teach OP's nibblings the truth.", "In a perfect world love conquers all. \n\n On earth however, you have to work through and sometimes comprise on issues in relationships. \n\nOnly someone that thinks they are better than everyone else walks away thinking they don\u2019t need to change or form a new mindset at all.", "I'm sorry if that seemed like an admonishment. I purposely quoted normal in the second sentence to distinguish the difference. My apologies for not being clear. I fully agree with your statement."]}
