There\u2019s a waitress named Alyssa. \n\nAlyssa is a very attractive woman, and our boss hits on her a lot, and it\u2019s really weird for 2 reasons. First of all, I\u2019m pretty sure she has autism, so his remarks go right over her head. Like once he said \u201cyou look great when you wipe the tables down\u201d and stared at her ass, and she said \u201cthanks\u201d once she said \u201cregisters are closed is there anything else you need me to do?\u201d And he said \u201coh I can think of a few things\u201d and she said \u201coh, it\u2019s not my turn to mop it\u2019s Jessie\u2019s\u201d (another waitress)\n\nThe other reason it\u2019s weird is because Alyssa is married and 24 years old. Our boss is 46. Her husband is a cool guy too. She doesn\u2019t work much anymore but every week or so when she does him and their baby will come in and get dinner. He also picks her up because she doesn\u2019t drive I don\u2019t think, so sometimes while he\u2019s waiting for her getting a beer or something I\u2019ll talk to him. He\u2019s pretty chill, she seems like she\u2019s well taken care of.\n\nSo the lakers were in town lately and often Alyssa will wear a lakers shirt. When there\u2019s a big basketball game she\u2019ll wear a lakers jersey. She\u2019s mentioned her and her husband are big lakers fans. Our boss has season tickets to our local team and gave her 2 tickets to the game. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure he expected to go with her, but she (obviously) brought the tickets home and went with her husband. I\u2019m pretty sure it was\n\nMy boss was complaining about it calling that really rude and inconsiderate, I said \u201cI don\u2019t know she\u2019s a married woman, why would she go to a basketball game with another man?\u201d And he said \u201cI thought it was pretty fucking obvious it was something for me and her not her husband\u201d and I said \u201cso you thought a happily married woman, who is a loyal wife, would go on a date with someone over 20 years older than her?\u201d And I thought he\u2019d laugh with me but he actually got really mad and sent me home.\n\nI\u2019m planning on putting my 2 weeks in. I also plan on telling her husband about the boss\u2019 remarks about her. I\u2019ve only spoken to him twice but he seems like a smart guy and will know what to do.\n\nMaybe this wasn\u2019t my buissness though and I should\u2019ve just not said anything? AITA?\n\nEdit: I would like to mention, I\u2019m 100% positive she has no clue about the boss\u2019 remarks. There are times I\u2019ve tried to ask her about table needs and she just doesn\u2019t understand. Her husband is also well off and this is not a job she needs at all. She has a huge wedding ring and her husband drives a bmw m4, plus she\u2019s only here one half shift a week.\n\n  I have been asking around for the husbands number to try and talk to him about it, but yeah I\u2019ve gotten confirmation from an assistant manager she does in fact have autism. She is a very attractive woman though, I think it\u2019s possible the boss knows she isn\u2019t getting it and just gets a kick out of saying it anyway, and to me that\u2019s even more scummy.", "created_utc": 1677914748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hsy6z/aita_for_defending_my_coworker_after_our_boss/", "score": 2179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also why are you telling her husband but not her? NTA, but there\u2019s some things in this story that don\u2019t jive very well with me.", "NTA- As a parent of a autistic child. THANK YOU SO MUCH for looking out for her.", "NTA but if the manager is not the owner or if its a chain with HR please report what is happening especially that she has a disability and doesn't understand the suggestive nature of what he us saying to her.  That you are worried her lack of understanding could put her in danger with him.", "NTA\n\nIs the manager married? Maybe she needs to know... although, with a creep this obvious, she probably already does. \n\nIs this a chain? Any possibility of reporting him for creating a hostile work environment? Sending you home for defending Alyssa is bullshit... and his whole conversation about his intent was inappropriate, you were just responding logically to it.", "NTA InshaAllah attempt to speak to both the husband and wife after her next shift when he comes to pick her up.", "NTA. Tell her husband! Fuck it, you\u2019re quitting anyway.", "Thank GOD people like you exist, you absolutely did the right thing by speaking up for your colleague, and it\u2019s so remarkably noble of you to be willing to quit your job to defend your values. HUGE NTA", "NTA at all. i would have told the husband the first time i talked to him.", "If you have a corporate office, make a complaint about the hostile work environment your boss has created by complaining about how his sexual harassment isn't working out. He's making you listen to his creepiness, and sent you home when you objected. NTA.", "NTA. But let me correct you on something here. It's not \"werid\" that he's hitting on Alyssa, it's just plain wrong and sexual harrassment for him to do so. If there's someone you can report him to, I would do that immedietly, and also tell her husband. You should have told her husband a long time ago. But I do love that the boss is getting some instant karma everytime he tried to hit on her and ask her out. But if Alyssa isn't careful and you don't do something about this boss who is very angry, he might do something a lot worse than sexual harrassment to Alyssa, something that starts with an \"R\", since he strikes me as a predator. Please protect your coworker to ensure this doesn't happen.", "Oh, she knows exactly what the boss is doing. She acts like she has no clue as a defense mechanism. It's a tactic a lot of women use to deal with sexual harassment. Been there, done that.\n\nYour boss is a sexual harasser. Autism isn't an excuse. NTA for your response to your boss, but YTA when it comes to your treatment of your coworker.", "What idiot gives someone a pair of tickets instead of saying, \"I have one extra, you can have it if you want\"? I would assume that anyone giving away their own tickets is doing so because they can't go. I wouldn't think to ask them.", "NTA, You sound like a kind coworker", "Why jot report him to HR ?", "I feel like just giving two weeks is letting the boss off the hook. I mean I\u2019m on no way giving advice here since I\u2019m not the OP, and I\u2019m also not suggesting that the OP burns things down (figuratively not literally), but idk it feels like this behavior needs to have consequences since it will probably persist again", "this!!!! OP, you and your boss are YTA here. many of your comments and assumptions about this woman are disgusting. talking to your boss was awesome of you, but you have no business talking about this to her husband...no matter how cool he seems to you, you have no idea how people can be behind closed doors. besides it seems like they are well aware and are already handling it beautifully by themselves.", "OP should also report this to HR if there is one and hey, since OP is leaving anyway, should put the company on blast.", "Husband seems like he has money so I\u2019m sure he will tell her as she\u2019s the one that Will need to testify when they sue the boss and the company for sexual harassment.", "If your boss has a boss, I would tell them too.", "OP doesn't want to work in a shit environment where he gets sent home early and looses money, because his boss can't handle the truth...  OP's boss is most likely thinking up ways to assign OP all the worst tasks and otherwise make his life miserable at work.  \n\nWhen OP says he's planning to give his two weeks, I presume that means he's applying for other jobs, so he can quit when he gets one without messing up his own finances.\n\nOP is being smart here.  There's no going back from embarrassing an AH like his boss.", "> Genuinely curious, what makes you think the husband doesn\u2019t know already?\n\n100% valid question, and that's what concerned me. My initial reaction was fuck this guy, destroy him, but in doing so it could completely disrupt Alyssa's life in the process.\n\nSo many variables at play, and with the level of awareness that *should* be happening here, the fact that it's being tolerated is a massive red flag.", "Dude. \"Autistic\" is not the same as \"stupid.\" By all means clue in her husband, but it's more important that you talk to the grown woman *who is the actual person being targeted by a creep.* She's neurodivergent, not a child.", "Literal is best. \u201cWhen Boss gave you the Lakers tickets, he was expecting you to go with him. I know he didn\u2019t tell you that, but he told me.\u201d And she might be surprised because \u201cI never said I liked him!\u201d Reassure her it\u2019s nothing she did or said, that Boss is just a creep. \n\nIs there someone over his head? Can you direct her to go to that person, and just \u201ctell them things he has said to you.\u201d I suspect if she told that person, they would understand how it was inappropriate. Offer to go with her as support, but let her tell her experiences. You can add yours too because you\u2019re a witness to things from when she wasn\u2019t around. Or if she doesn\u2019t want to, say that\u2019s fine too.", "Well, there's those games and games against the Toronto Raptors.", "Ok I get that you're trying to emphasize that she's a bit slow, but her struggling with remembering things does not necessarily mean that she is genuinely oblivious to what the manager is doing. Her reactions are standard creep-dodging 101 when you have a power imbalance like this. \n\nYou talk about her having no clue, but it sounds like she's in an environment where nobody has attempted to interject and address this man's behaviour up until this point, let alone actually asked if she's alright or offered support.", "You\u2019re NTA at all, but I think you\u2019re also infantilizing this woman. She obviously is able to understand people if she\u2019s a waitress. And not having a driver\u2019s? That doesn\u2019t really mean anything. Sometimes people don\u2019t like driving. It can be overwhelming and scary for some. If her husband is ok driving, that\u2019s what works for them.\n\nAs for the \u201cneed\u201d for a job, sometimes people like to work. It\u2019s nice getting out and talking to people. Besides, it\u2019s quite important for a woman to have her own source of income, however small. She wants to be there regardless of her husband\u2019s financial situation. \n\nPlease talk to this woman directly. Her husband isn\u2019t her handler. She deserves to know what\u2019s going on, and she deserves the respect of being told directly and not through her husband.", "I am so sorry that happened to you", "I am so sorry this happened to you.", "He should tell her that the boss was badmouthing her for taking the tickets and going with her husband, tell her the boss clearly expected it to be a \"date\" between the two of them...  and sent OP home for pointing out she was married.  \n\nAnd tell her everyone at the restaurant thinks he has a major crush on her, and are worried how he might escalate things now that he's mad at her.\n\nShe's been there for his other comments, the thing she needs to know is that he's talking bad about her behind her back, and that he's mad at her and she should expect he might try to \"punish\" her or otherwise retaliate in the future.", "I'm in therapy, I'm surviving. Thank you for the regards!", "Nta, as others had said tell the husband and Alyssa, because If she doesn't get it as you said, probably your boss will escalate things to make it more \"obvious\"", "Me too!!! \n\nAt least one time the bus driver came to my defense and kicked a dude off the bus.", "This really strong accented Russian dude with a suitcase who had boarded from the airport stop helped me out one time too. It was awesome. The guy being a creep kept following me as I moved seats away from him multiple times even though I kept calling him out as I did and no one helped me till Russian guy. He escorted me up the stairs to the top of the bus and then blocked the stairs off with his suitcase while yelling at him in Russian and broken English while the bus driver tried to get to a stop where he could kick the creepy guy off.\n\nI was 19 in black baggy sweatpants and a sweatshirt and he kept sitting as close to me as possible and leaning in and staring at my boobs and making awful comments about me (and them.)\n\nWhen I moved the first time I didn\u2019t say anything I just moved across seats. The next stop he move and sat directly next to me. I said \u201chey you\u2019re making me uncomfortable. I\u2019m going to move seats, please don\u2019t follow me.\u201d And I moved again. He did the same thing at the next stop so I loudly called him out and said \u201cyou\u2019ve followed me twice when I have moved seats and i asked you to please leave me alone. I\u2019m moving again, don\u2019t follow me!\u201d And move seats. He moved again for a third time but started talking about how it wasn\u2019t his fault that I was wearing what I was wearing (baggy sweatshirt and sweatpants again guys) and why was I assuming the worst of him. He just wanted to have a friendly conversation and then he started going OFF about how rude I was and getting really aggressive. That was when the Russian guy stood up from the step up level and came down and got me, and led me up. He told the guy not to follow and asked the bus driver (yelled but nicely) to kick him off. The bus driver agreed. But then the guy started trying to follow me up and that\u2019s when the Russian guy stopped at him and started yelling at him and the bus driver made it clear he needed to sit down and be ready to be kicked off when they stopped next. He wasn\u2019t cooperative so they called the cops to meet him.\n\nI wish I could say that was a wild one off story, but it really wasn\u2019t.", "So many of these stories. I'm so sorry. This kind of thing is particularly terrifying because he clearly didn't care that a scene was being made. You honestly don't know what someone like that is capable of I'm glad at least one person got involved."]}
