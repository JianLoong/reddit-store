There\u2019s a waitress named Alyssa. \n\nAlyssa is a very attractive woman, and our boss hits on her a lot, and it\u2019s really weird for 2 reasons. First of all, I\u2019m pretty sure she has autism, so his remarks go right over her head. Like once he said \u201cyou look great when you wipe the tables down\u201d and stared at her ass, and she said \u201cthanks\u201d once she said \u201cregisters are closed is there anything else you need me to do?\u201d And he said \u201coh I can think of a few things\u201d and she said \u201coh, it\u2019s not my turn to mop it\u2019s Jessie\u2019s\u201d (another waitress)\n\nThe other reason it\u2019s weird is because Alyssa is married and 24 years old. Our boss is 46. Her husband is a cool guy too. She doesn\u2019t work much anymore but every week or so when she does him and their baby will come in and get dinner. He also picks her up because she doesn\u2019t drive I don\u2019t think, so sometimes while he\u2019s waiting for her getting a beer or something I\u2019ll talk to him. He\u2019s pretty chill, she seems like she\u2019s well taken care of.\n\nSo the lakers were in town lately and often Alyssa will wear a lakers shirt. When there\u2019s a big basketball game she\u2019ll wear a lakers jersey. She\u2019s mentioned her and her husband are big lakers fans. Our boss has season tickets to our local team and gave her 2 tickets to the game. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure he expected to go with her, but she (obviously) brought the tickets home and went with her husband. I\u2019m pretty sure it was\n\nMy boss was complaining about it calling that really rude and inconsiderate, I said \u201cI don\u2019t know she\u2019s a married woman, why would she go to a basketball game with another man?\u201d And he said \u201cI thought it was pretty fucking obvious it was something for me and her not her husband\u201d and I said \u201cso you thought a happily married woman, who is a loyal wife, would go on a date with someone over 20 years older than her?\u201d And I thought he\u2019d laugh with me but he actually got really mad and sent me home.\n\nI\u2019m planning on putting my 2 weeks in. I also plan on telling her husband about the boss\u2019 remarks about her. I\u2019ve only spoken to him twice but he seems like a smart guy and will know what to do.\n\nMaybe this wasn\u2019t my buissness though and I should\u2019ve just not said anything?

Of course she was going to go with her husband.

(Hostile work environment. It doesn't matter that his remarks go over her head; they are not going over your head. You're also a victim here.) I absolutely agree with telling her husband.\n\nYou may also wish to keep in contact with her and her husband after you leave.

The boss is a total creep and shouldn't be in charge of anyone.", "NTA - but if I were you I\u2019d talk to the waitress and the husband off site and let them know you are concerned about your bosses actions.", "NTA BUT, I'm going to edit this.\n\n> I also plan on telling her husband about the boss\u2019 remarks about her.\n\nThis whole situation is pretty f'd up actually. You could literally ruin her life. She may need this job which is why she tolerates it. Her husband could be a recovering alcoholic, or a man with an extraordinary temper, or something, and this could send him over the edge, who knows.\n\nThis whole situation needs a lot of consideration. I'd start with Alyssa and let her figure it out. She needs a new job, your boss needs to be reported, but with the economy the way it is, maybe she's lucky to even have a job.\n\nThis is a delicate situation.\n\n-----\n\nNTA.

Definitely should not be sending you home for it.\n\nAs for speaking to her husband, i think that's wrong. You should speak directly to your colleague about it. These things might go over her head, but that's no reason not to tell her your concerns. It's then for her to think about if she isn't already aware. She can then go home and discuss with her husband if she wants.", "NTA for sure tell her and her husband", "NTA.\nNot the key issue here but genuinely, if someone gave me two tickets I would assume they were for me and someone of my choosing (my partner / her husband in the story are the obvious choices!). If you wanted to take someone somewhere, why give them two tickets in the expectation they would give one back? Just say \u201cI have a spare ticket for X tonight, would you like to go with me?\u201d. Again, not the issue here but OP\u2019s boss is dumb as well as well as creepy.", "Nta. Or maybe she knows exactly what he's doing and is ignoring him... Kind of like pretending to not understand and making people explain the horrible things they say?\n\nI'd contact HR... Or the owner. \n\nBut the autism thing is gross.", "NTA good on ya. Tell her and her husband about the bosses remarks verbatum so they can know.", "NTA and glad you didn\u2019t decide to talk to her about this. Talking to her husband is definitely the best option as they can decide as a team what step they want to take. Hopefully everything works out for everyone except the boss.", "This is absolutely the correct thing to do. Perverted boss flirts with a taken employee?
