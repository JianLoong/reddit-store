Like once he said \u201cyou look great when you wipe the tables down\u201d and stared at her ass, and she said \u201cthanks\u201d once she said \u201cregisters are closed is there anything else you need me to do?\u201d And he said \u201coh I can think of a few things\u201d and she said \u201coh, it\u2019s not my turn to mop it\u2019s Jessie\u2019s\u201d (another waitress)\n\nThe other reason it\u2019s weird is because Alyssa is married and 24 years old.

He also picks her up because she doesn\u2019t drive I don\u2019t think, so sometimes while he\u2019s waiting for her getting a beer or something I\u2019ll talk to him.

When there\u2019s a big basketball game she\u2019ll wear a lakers jersey. She\u2019s mentioned her and her husband are big lakers fans.

I also plan on telling her husband about the boss\u2019 remarks about her. I\u2019ve only spoken to him twice but he seems like a smart guy and will know what to do.\n\nMaybe this wasn\u2019t my buissness though and I should\u2019ve just not said anything?

She didn't fall into the obvious trap of offering to take her boss(which you know makes no sense) with her. \n\nYour boss for all the obvious reasons of trying to creep on his much younger employee and getting huffy for being called out when it continues to fail. \n\nTALK TO ALYSSA, SHE'S A GODDAMN ADULT AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE OF SOME RELIEF TO HER TO KNOW AT LEAST ONE OF HER COWORKERS IS AWARE OF WTF YOUR MANAGER IS DOING. \n\nShe's cut her shifts down and she brings her husband and kid in as a clear sign she's happy.", "INFO how badly do you need the 2 weeks pay?\n\nBecause I would find somewhere else and tell them that I can start immediately.", "NTA If there is another boss or owner above him, I would file a report of his sexual harassment, it is unacceptable. Definitely let her husband know you have witnessed this.", "Sure, tell the husband.  But tell Alyssa too!  Don\u2019t put her in a situation where she potentially knows LESS than she did before\u2026 which is what could happen if the husband decides that Alyssa doesn\u2019t need to know about what\u2019s going on here and starts making unilateral decisions on her behalf that he doesn\u2019t explain.  Such as telling her she needs to quit without telling her why.\n\nI mean, hopefully the husband is a good guy and will tell her anyway.  But don\u2019t neglect to tell Alyssa.  If it feels awkward to tell her about something she\u2019s been previously oblivious to, telling her with the husband present should help a lot.. and you get to see for yourself if the husband is really a good guy by how he reacts to the information.", "see this was my one issue, OP goes as far as to call the girl possibly autistic just because she doesnt react to the boss. everything OP describes seems like her intentionally ignoring the boss' bullshit to avoid drama. she acts like she doesnt know what he's implying because it's easier than acknowledging it and then trying to discourage it, just act like there is nothing there and nothing will be there.   \n\n\nOP going right into \"she's autistic!\" seems like an issue", "> Her husband could be a recovering alcoholic, or a man with an extraordinary temper, or something, and this could send him over the edge, who knows.\n\nGenuinely curious, what makes you think the husband doesn\u2019t know already? This is something that I think many people would mention to their spouse unless they *truly* weren\u2019t registering that the boss is a creep. But the fact Alyssa\u2019s husband picks her up every single day, sometimes sits at the bar, and occasionally brings their baby along all sounds to me like a husband who\u2019s aware his wife needs/wants her job but also wants to make sure her boss knows she has a man in her life.", "I am pretty sure both of them know already. Alyssa maybe ND, but her bland responses to the boss' sexual harassment sound more like a defense strategy than not understanding what's happening. Add to that that she doesn't take many shifts anymore, and when she does her family comes to the restaurant, and yeah, they know.", "It sounds like this guy is probably trying to take advantage of her and she's not aware", "Yep because having to be present with that stuff is creating a hostile workplace for everyone else who is exposed to his behavior.", "Season ticket holders would probably also generally live in the LA area, or at least in Cali. And even if the season ticket holder lived further away, it's not likely an employee could take a lot of time off to travel to/from a game in the event they were gifted tickets. From this we can assume OP probably lives/works in the LA area.", "The easiest way of dealing with creepy comments and street catcalls is to behave blissfully ignorant. They don't get the icky pleasure of embarrassing you, and you don't have to waste time on a confrontation with an AH. It's possible Alyssa is doing just this.\n\nNTA", "I wondered if she was playing dumb, which is about her only option if she is non-confrontational.", "Both scenarios are possible. Either she is intentionally not addressing his sexual harassment or she does have autism/Asperger\u2019s and she really doesn\u2019t understand the nuance and innuendo in his statements.", "Yeah this seemed most likely to me.", "Yeah, that rubbed me the wrong way too.", "Yes! The number of comments agreeing that her husband needs to be informed/agreeing that she needs to be treated like a child is mind-boggling.\n\n(Not to mention, even if she was on the spectrum, it still doesn't mean she should be treated like a child/ward of her husband)", "Yup. I remember at my first office job after college, my boss sat on my desk and told me how sexy I was. I was about 22; he was in his late 40s. I had to play stupid because I didn\u2019t want to hurt my job so I brushed it off. In future instances, he had shown what a child he was when he didn\u2019t get attention and would take it out verbally on employees with a nasty attitude and would make the entire office feel uncomfortable. Eventually, the owner of the company found out about his behavior, in addition to some racist things he said in the office, and he got fired, so it all worked out.", "The boss gave her Lakers tickets, and she took her husband. The husband at least knows about the inappropriate gifts, he likely has some idea", "I agree that the husband\u2019s behavior suggests he already knows, but I also agree that OP should talk to Alyssa first just in case the husband doesn\u2019t react well.", "I was just coming to say this. She absolutely knows what boss man is doing and implying, she\u2019s just smart enough to not engage with them even a little. She\u2019s grey rocking in the most beautiful way.\n\nGood on you, OP, for saying something to the boss, though. Creepy people get away with this kind of stuff a lot because bystanders don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m sure Alyssa would thank you, too.", "Autistic woman here, I'm unsure cause we don't know Alyssa - It's like if I was put in her position there are so many variables & then fight/flight/dear/autopilot.", "It\u2019s all of his business!!!", "It sounds like the season tickets are for a local team and the Lakers were visiting", "Yuppp. When I was 18 I had crappy gas station job (mom & pop- not corporate, so no HR, etc.) with a creepy older manager. He would hit on me all the time (like blatantly inviting me to his apartment and asking for pics) and inappropriately touch me (hand on lower back when standing next to me, pushing up against me when trying to walk by, etc) and when I finally stood up for myself and told him to stop my hours were cut down from 32-40 hours a week to 6 hours a week. And he knew I was struggling financially. \n\nAt 18, I was very young and just thought men being that way was normal and I didn\u2019t think I had any options but to quit or put up with it. And quitting was hard because it was a small town with not a ton of opportunities. Now that I\u2019m 30 I\u2019m horrified and wish I had looked at my legal options since this was all happening at work and I was experiencing retaliation for not going along with it. \n\nAnyways, I could totally see this woman in OP\u2019s story playing oblivious to not rock the boat in order to keep her employment status safe. The fact that the manager sent OP home out of anger and costing OP lost wages for the day proves that he\u2019s the type that would do the same to her if she spoke out. Honestly, I hope she lawyers up. He\u2019s blatantly harassing her.", "> Nta. Or maybe she knows exactly what he's doing and is ignoring him... Kind of like pretending to not understand and making people explain the horrible things they say?", "I wondered if she was playing dumb, which is her only option if she is non-confrontational.", "Very similar experience here. I bet a lot of woman have a story like this.\n\nOP is NTA", "I agree that the husband\u2019s behavior suggests he already knows,", ">A major point you seem to have missed is her spectrum induced obliviousness to her bosses creepy ways. \n\nAre you sure she's actually on the spectrum, or in any way oblivious? She might very well just put on that act, a lot of women deal with creeps that way. Could be a version of \"grey rock\".", "Op is guessing at the diagnosis. Talk to the actual adult involved rather than treating her like some baby child.", "This is exactly correct. Like if the wife were acting shady, let the husband know. But even if it is incidentally she is doing everything correctly. \n\nMaybe he already knows and this is the approach they agreed upon together. Besides the dude is going to know something is up when his wife came home with Lakers tickets.", "I\u2019m not sure why you are getting downvoted so hard, you\u2019re completely correct. Maybe OP should see if he can find her dad and brothers too just in case\u2026", "Right?!"]}
