There\u2019s a waitress named Alyssa. \n\nAlyssa is a very attractive woman, and our boss hits on her a lot, and it\u2019s really weird for 2 reasons. First of all, I\u2019m pretty sure she has autism, so his remarks go right over her head. Like once he said \u201cyou look great when you wipe the tables down\u201d and stared at her ass, and she said \u201cthanks\u201d once she said \u201cregisters are closed is there anything else you need me to do?\u201d And he said \u201coh I can think of a few things\u201d and she said \u201coh, it\u2019s not my turn to mop it\u2019s Jessie\u2019s\u201d (another waitress)\n\nThe other reason it\u2019s weird is because Alyssa is married and 24 years old. Our boss is 46. Her husband is a cool guy too. She doesn\u2019t work much anymore but every week or so when she does him and their baby will come in and get dinner. He also picks her up because she doesn\u2019t drive I don\u2019t think, so sometimes while he\u2019s waiting for her getting a beer or something I\u2019ll talk to him. He\u2019s pretty chill, she seems like she\u2019s well taken care of.\n\nSo the lakers were in town lately and often Alyssa will wear a lakers shirt. When there\u2019s a big basketball game she\u2019ll wear a lakers jersey. She\u2019s mentioned her and her husband are big lakers fans. Our boss has season tickets to our local team and gave her 2 tickets to the game. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure he expected to go with her, but she (obviously) brought the tickets home and went with her husband. I\u2019m pretty sure it was\n\nMy boss was complaining about it calling that really rude and inconsiderate, I said \u201cI don\u2019t know she\u2019s a married woman, why would she go to a basketball game with another man?\u201d And he said \u201cI thought it was pretty fucking obvious it was something for me and her not her husband\u201d and I said \u201cso you thought a happily married woman, who is a loyal wife, would go on a date with someone over 20 years older than her?\u201d And I thought he\u2019d laugh with me but he actually got really mad and sent me home.\n\nI\u2019m planning on putting my 2 weeks in. I also plan on telling her husband about the boss\u2019 remarks about her. I\u2019ve only spoken to him twice but he seems like a smart guy and will know what to do.\n\nMaybe this wasn\u2019t my buissness though and I should\u2019ve just not said anything? AITA?\n\nEdit: I would like to mention, I\u2019m 100% positive she has no clue about the boss\u2019 remarks. There are times I\u2019ve tried to ask her about table needs and she just doesn\u2019t understand. Her husband is also well off and this is not a job she needs at all. She has a huge wedding ring and her husband drives a bmw m4, plus she\u2019s only here one half shift a week.\n\n  I have been asking around for the husbands number to try and talk to him about it, but yeah I\u2019ve gotten confirmation from an assistant manager she does in fact have autism. She is a very attractive woman though, I think it\u2019s possible the boss knows she isn\u2019t getting it and just gets a kick out of saying it anyway, and to me that\u2019s even more scummy.\n\nUpdate- I got the husbands info and was able to call him and let him know the situation. Turns out he had no clue about this, and she also had no clue (which I suspected) and thanked him for letting him know. I don\u2019t think his wife will ever be returning for work.\n\nI also have an interview at a new restaurant as a line cook on Thursday.
