I was asked 6 weeks ago and her wedding is now 7 months away. \n\nI assumed that the normal expectations would be in place: help plan/attend the bridal showers, bachelorette party, etc. and be part of the wedding day and reception. I expected some time and financial obligation, of course, but the responsibilities are really getting out of hand. Also, the vibe of the wedding has changed and I\u2019m nervous about the repercussions to my career. \n\nI must\n\n\\-Pay for my bridesmaid dress ($475)\n\n\\-Pay for my hair/makeup on the wedding day ($250)\n\n\\-Pay for and host one of the events..bridal shower, honeydew, stock the bar, bachelorette, etc. (Each bridesmaid is responsible for funding and hosting one of the events. (At least $500)\n\n\\-Pay for my part of the out-of-state, week-long bachelorette trip ($675+ food cost+ missing a week of pay at work)\n\n\\-Contribute $100 to their honeymoon fund (she specifically requested $100 donations)\n\n\\-Purchase a gift off their wedding registry (nothing on the registry is below $150)\n\n\\-Cover all other odds and ends costs\u2026wedding day shoes, matching bachelorette trip outfits/accessories, etc. \n\nFinancially, being a part of this wedding is going to cost well over $2,000. Again, I expected to be spending money and I\u2019m not cheap. But this seems a bit excessive. \n\nThe other issue I have is the vibe of the wedding. Before, it was a typical, traditional wedding. Now, it\u2019s become heavily centered around alcohol and guns. I don\u2019t just mean that it\u2019s an open bar. But the actual theme of the wedding is now \u201cShots, Shots, and Vows.\u201d No, I can\u2019t make this up.\n\nThe bridesmaid photos are going to be the bridesmaids taking shots. The groomsmen photos will have the groomsmen holding guns. During the ceremony, the officiant will say \u201cDoes anybody object?\u201d and all the groomsmen will pull out their guns to jokingly \u201cthreaten\u201d anybody who objects. When the bridesmaids and groomsmen enter the reception, we must run down an aisle lined with shots and take as many of them as possible. \n\nI am not a prude by any means, nor do I have an issue with alcohol. However, I am very cautious of what I post online. I work for the public school system as a teacher and like to keep things professional. I know the pictures will end up online on social media, and I\u2019d prefer not to be pictured taking shots and chugging alcohol. Also, with the climate of school shootings and other traumatic events, I think the idea of guns is in poor taste.\n\nI feel bad to back out after making a commitment. I love my friend and am honored to stand by her on the most important day of her life. I know I need to make a decision soon as she would need time to fill my spot. Am I selfish for worrying about my own finances on her big day? Or for worrying about my public image? I don\u2019t want to lose a friend over this.

Wow.. I wouldn't even want to attend that wedding as a guest!! Does she seriously think taking shots and then pulling out guns (even as a 'joke') is a good idea?!", "NTA. This sounds like the demands of a very entitled and privileged person making demands that are unreasonable for others. \n\nYou don't have to give a reason why, but if you do, the price would be enough. Mentioning the discomfort about the theme and activities might make this bride to be into a bridezilla and threaten your friendship.", "NTA\n\nThat kind of financial expectation alone is way out of line plus your feelings about the wedding are valid.\n\nBut tell her soon, don't dither. \n\nAlso I would advise not to say it's purely about the money because then if she says she'll pay for a lot of it, you are then left having to say you're also not comfortable with the theme of the wedding. That just makes it messier.\n\nUnfortunately you may lose our damage the friendship no matter how you tell her but sometimes that can't be avoided, sad though it is.", "well, that sounds like one of the stupidest weddings ever, and the expectations are outright ludicrous. I think your $2000 estimate is on the low side.  Get out of it now! just say you are not able to fulfil all the obligations (your reasons are none of her business).", "Each bridesmaid is supposed to plan and fund a separate party? Wtf is this!!!\n\nThis is a tacky cash grab wedding situation. I'd be embarrassed to be involved frankly.", "NTA - just....wow.  Please feel free to back out of being a bridesmaid.  You can always blame it on the financial commitment because $2000 is a lot of money to come up with out of nowhere.  I probably wouldn't comment on the theme, just let her know that you're honored to have been asked, and you are so excited for her.  You've gone through your budget and simply cannot afford the expenses that go along with the wedding, and have to back out as a bridesmaid, and you'll be there as a guest.", "NTA. What the actual fuck? I'd back out of that & not even attend! What kind of person thinks getting a bunch of people drunk & giving them guns is a good idea? I'd back out of being a bridesmaid just because of the ridiculous cost, regardless of the theme. Someone expecting that much from their wedding party is bound to also be an unpleasant bride, as well. Run away!\n\nI'm pretty non confrontational, so I'd probably say that I had a cousin getting married that weekend, so I have to go to the family event, but I might actually work up the guts to tell her the real reason; idk.", "NTA.\n\nOh... My Goods. Your friend group is... unhinged. Is everyone really okay with this?! I'm not a teacher and even I'd feel this would be detrimental to my career...\nDo what you must to keep your career safe within reason, and imo backing out of this wedding is within reason.", "Why are you friends with these nutters", "It's 7 MONTHS away.

Girl, whew, I wanted to run from the room I am currently nap trapped in more and more the further I read. The instinct to flee is strong with this one. I would respectfully request demotion to wedding invitee and offer $500 to the honeymoon fund if money was no issue. If money was an issue I would say that my financial circumstances had changed and I deeply apologize but I must drop out. It wouldn\u2019t even be a lie irl for me right now, OT has been cut.", ">*When the bridesmaids and groomsmen enter the reception, we must run down an aisle lined with shots and take as many of them as possible.*\n\nPlease tell me none of the guns are going to be loaded. Because sloshed guests + loaded guns is a recipe for absolute *disaster*.\n\nThat said, NTA. Yes, it's true that it's the bride and groom's special day, but your finances have long-term consequences, and you need to keep that in mind. (I haven't attended many weddings; is it normal for the couple to demand donations for their honeymoon...?)\n\nIf you backed out on short notice, like the day before the wedding, that would be a different story, but if you did it now, that should give her enough time to make arrangements for your absence. You could just attend the wedding as a normal guest, so you wouldn't be expected to pay as much, and you can still be there in support of your friend.", "I look forward to this wedding making the news due to an accidental shooting. NTA", "NTA - there's still a lot of time to the wedding and you made the commitment relatively recently. The wedding quite frankly sounds cringe and a lot of the things they are asking you to do is not normal bridesmaids requests. Better to do it now rather than later. \n\nThat being said, there's no predicting how your friend will react. She could be totally fine and understand. She could lose it and say she never wants to speak to you again. People get crazy over weddings. \n\nSo even though you definitely won't be TA, you should be prepared for uncertainty over how the bride will take it.", "NTA. Much too much money, too many demands, and an appalling theme.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be there...and that is a lot of money that can be quite a stretch for people. A week long's trip?!! A cash gift AND an item gift? Goodness. Yeah, I would back out.", "YWNBTA, IMO. That's a hefty time/financial commitment... Like you said, it seems excessive. That's in addition to being uncomfortable with the changing tone of the wedding. If you backed out, YWNBTA, but you should probably be prepared to lose a friend. She'd undoubtedly be hurt.", "Some people barely spend 2k on their own wedding. Do you honestly see yourself continuing this friendship either way? Keep the money and bow out politely.", "NTA, it's 7 months out so it's not like you backing out is disruptive to the wedding plans so honestly even if you didn't have a good reason it wouldn't be that big of a deal, but tack on to that that she expects you to pay over two *grand* for the privilege of being a bridesmaid? A few hundred for the bachelorette party is one thing, but $2k is fucking obscene.\n\nAlso the gun thing seems like a legitimate concern, both for your image concerns and because I have to question how seriously they take gun safety if part of the ceremony is going to be a bunch of drunk groomsmen brandishing firearms at the guests. I'm pro-gun but this isn't pro-gun shit this is gun-nut weirdo shit.", "Even ignoring the uh... questionable.... taste, NTA. $2k plus a week's worth of personal time? That's ridiculously unreasonable to ask of anyone, even if they can afford it.\n\nNow if we do account for the taste in the theme - I wouldn't be within 100 miles of this train wreck.", "NTA\n\nwhy do women put their friends thru so much for their wedding? The excessive spending, the crazy \u201crequirements\u201d having to pay 100 for honeymoon and 150 for a gift? Like why do so many women treat this day like they can do whatever they fuck they want and request everything from their friends that they desire? \n\nI\u2019ve been a groomsmen in about 8 weddings and outside of the tux and the bachelor party I\u2019ve never been \u201cexpected\u201d to spend crazy amounts of money and fulfill this childish, entitled demands from my friend. \n\nALL OF THIS for a ceremony for a wedding that has a 50/50 chance of not ending in divorce anyway", "NTA. First of all the financial obligations are reason enough to drop out, but if you feel uncomfortable with all the other stuff as well and have the fear of getting fired from your school top it all. If she is a real friend she understands, if she doesn't she isn't worth the financial obligations anyway, and not a real friend you want to be a bridesmaid too. \n\nIn the end, you might have to deal with a friendship ending and be willing to risk this as a potential outcome - if you really don't want to be involved in all those things and are willing to risk it then drop out asap. so she can find someone else.", "NTA. This sounds like the perfect wedding for Mickey and Mallory (*Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in NBK*). \n\nIm guessing there\u2019s no point in mentioning that weddings are meant to be a joyous and celebratory occasions, and that the presence of guns along with threatening \u201cjokes\u201d could make some guests feel uneasy or unsafe. \n\nSo stick with the financial aspect and be firm that you\u2019re stepping down. I just hope you don\u2019t get threatened with a \u201cjoke\u201d gun.", "Good lord nta. Are Americans OK? This sounds horrible.\n\nIt was sweet she asked, but that's an expensive sounding time just leading up to the big day. And I don't blame you for wanting to back out. I'm uncomfortable just reading what's gonna happen at this wedding.\n\nTell her you're flattered she wanted you beside her on her big day, but financially you can't do it. And, assuming you still like this bonkers sounding friend enough to even go as a guest, you'd still love to be there as a guest to support their union. If not, just drop out entirely and be prepared for the probable backlash.\n\nThough honestly, they sound like crazy people and you could probably have a better time elsewhere with better sounding people.", "Wtf is a \u201choneydew\u201d? Can\u2019t people just get married like normal anymore or what", "NTA this sounds like a lot", "NTA. This sounds way over the top. Get out now.", "NTA you are giving her plenty of time to find a new person.  Shocked at how much  stuff she expects from you. in my day we bought our dress and shoes and that's it", "DEFINITELY NTA\n\n$2000 is a lot of money!! That is literally my mortgage payment and car payment. . . . .combined!! I wouldn't just back out of the wedding, I would talk to your friend and tell her that money is tight and you can't afford $2000. I'm a fan of giving people the benefit of a doubt. Your friend might be more than willing to work with you, especially with the rising cost of food, gas, and energy.\n\nAlso, I would bring up the concern with your social media. I've seen people get fired over things that were put on facebook. Requesting that no pictures get posted of you drinking alcohol isn't a big ask. In my family, we have always been huge supporters of the 2A, but I also realize that a lot of people do not like guns and feel uncomfortable being around them. Even if it was my \"special day,\" I wouldn't force my beliefs on a friend and force them to be around something that they feel uncomfortable with. \n\nSo no, you're not TAH, but it would be kinda rude of you to back out without communicating your concerns with your friend. If she is unwilling to work with you, then I think it's fine if you were to back out of the wedding party.", "No yWNBTA. That is a a ridiculous amount for a bridesmaid to pay, wow. you should just tell her honestly after looking at your financials it\u2019s looking like you cannot afford it. Apologize and hope she understands.", "NTA. \n\nGuns are not a prop or a theme. Responsible gun owners take firearms seriously. They do not wave unloaded guns around at a wedding. Unloaded guns should be treated with care in case a bullet was missed. A gun is not a joke or for play. \n\nEven if they used toy guns, this whole idea is cringey.\n\nAnd running in taking shots? Is this a wedding or a keg party? Yikes.", "NTA. This is insane. I wouldn't go to the be wedding either, honestly. It sounds like a shit show. The level of entitlement + crazy is over the top. ( I'm looking forward to hearing how embarrassed she'll be when she looks back on this in 10 years).", "Girl, RUN.\n\n(Also, wtf is a honeydew?)", "NTA. YOu have every right to ruin about your finances -- because this is YOUR life. She can choose her wedding and you can choose to be part of it and how you are part of it or not.", "$2000 dollars to be a bridesmaid? Automatic NTA and these bridzillas need to slow their roll.", "NTA\n\nThis is absurd. The \"requirements\" are ridiculous. Expecting people to be able to pony up $2k, plus the time involved, strikes me as incredibly self-centered. You're not selfish at all. It is not selfish to not want to go into debt (for example) or risk your career for someone's wedding. Your career is long-term; a wedding is one day.\n\nI'm also all for having fun at weddings, and by no means demand everything be traditional, but the idea of having people pull guns out as a f\\*cking JOKE? I'd say do they have an idea how traumatized people will be, but I'm sure they don't care. I'd be very upset and find nothing funny about it.\n\nI also think you are completely correct to worry about any social media repercussions. If I were a teacher, I'd be horrified, honestly. \n\nPlease, do not feel guilty about bowing out. The easiest thing is likely to simply say you can't afford the money, and do it ASAP so she has plenty of time to find someone to take your spot. Don't let them railroad you into any more specifics if you don't feel comfortable giving them.\n\nI know you say you don't want to lose a friend, but don't compromise yourself here. If she's a real friend, she'll accept your reasoning and that will be that. If she doesn't, then I think you're better off without her.", "NTA - it\u2019s going to cost much more than the 2,000 you listed because you didn\u2019t include your wages that you are going to be out of.  \n\nVery irresponsible to think people have that kind of money to just blow with nothing to show for the expense.  Only one obtaining anything from this is the bride.\n\nAs a teacher, in states, they have a clause in the contract that if they see anything they deem improper that you can be fired.  Is it all worth it for you?\nIf not, recuse yourself and do not feel guilty.", "NTA. Bail out now. I wouldn't even attend the ceremony. Pulling guns out if anyone objects as a joke? I'm NAL but I'm thinking that at least would be reckless endangerment.  There's also the possibility (if you're in the US and depending on the state), there could be legal ccl holders or an off duty cop in attendance that may decide to pull out their own gun. Stupid idea.", "NTA on any front.\n\nSeven months is more than enough time to adjust wedding plans. If cost were the only issue, I would suggest speaking with her, letting her know that this is not doable in your budget, and see if you could come up with a compromise. Just the fact that there is a minimum on wedding gifts though makes me think that this might be for naught. \n\nGenerally, if it were a wedding theme that I thought was cringey/dumb, I would probably suck it up and participate if it were for someone that I was close enough to be considered part of the wedding party. However, guns and alcohol don't mix, and this theme is literally \"guns, alcohol, and vows\". I also highly doubt any publicly available venue would allow this. I could theoretically see an event in which toy cap guns (like western themed) or water guns or something like that could be a good time (for people who are more fun than me), but it would have to be EXTREMELY clear that no real weapons, even unloaded, are allowed. Even then, all it would take is one drunk asshole to think it's funny to bring a real piece into the wedding.\n\nEdit: I will say the only place I think you're being kind of paranoid about is the social media aspect but nowhere near enough to call you the asshole because you are well within your rights to deem it too risky. You can definitely adjust privacy settings on social media and keep a situational awareness at the party regarding pictures being taken (you don't have to do keg stands, but fuck anybody that makes a fuss about you doing a group shot at a wedding).", "NTA- um what! Why so many events they need hosting. WOW. back out now why you still have some savings.", "NTA. The expenses would be enough for you to back out\u2014I hate it when I agree to do something for a friend and then get hit with all kinds of unexpected terms. But of much greater concern, and any responsible gun owner would say this, is that aiming guns at people, even in jest is a dangerously stupid thing to do. You don't want to be anywhere near this\u2014not even as an attendee. You should probably let her know that your reason is both the expense and the presence of guns, as I think it likely that one of her sane relatives\u2014if she has any\u2014is going to step up and squash the \"shots, shots, and vows\" idea.", "\u2018Run down an aisle lined with shots & take as many of them as possible\u2019 wtf have I just read?!

I was asked 6 weeks ago and her wedding is now 7 months away. \n\nI assumed that the normal expectations would be in place: help plan/attend the bridal showers, bachelorette party, etc. and be part of the wedding day and reception. I expected some time and financial obligation, of course, but the responsibilities are really getting out of hand. Also, the vibe of the wedding has changed and I\u2019m nervous about the repercussions to my career. \n\nI must\n\n\\-Pay for my bridesmaid dress ($475)\n\n\\-Pay for my hair/makeup on the wedding day ($250)\n\n\\-Pay for and host one of the events..bridal shower, honeydew, stock the bar, bachelorette, etc. (Each bridesmaid is responsible for funding and hosting one of the events. (At least $500)\n\n\\-Pay for my part of the out-of-state, week-long bachelorette trip ($675+ food cost+ missing a week of pay at work)\n\n\\-Contribute $100 to their honeymoon fund (she specifically requested $100 donations)\n\n\\-Purchase a gift off their wedding registry (nothing on the registry is below $150)\n\n\\-Cover all other odds and ends costs\u2026wedding day shoes, matching bachelorette trip outfits/accessories, etc. \n\nFinancially, being a part of this wedding is going to cost well over $2,000. Again, I expected to be spending money and I\u2019m not cheap. But this seems a bit excessive. \n\nThe other issue I have is the vibe of the wedding. Before, it was a typical, traditional wedding. Now, it\u2019s become heavily centered around alcohol and guns. I don\u2019t just mean that it\u2019s an open bar. But the actual theme of the wedding is now \u201cShots, Shots, and Vows.\u201d No, I can\u2019t make this up.\n\nThe bridesmaid photos are going to be the bridesmaids taking shots. The groomsmen photos will have the groomsmen holding guns. During the ceremony, the officiant will say \u201cDoes anybody object?\u201d and all the groomsmen will pull out their guns to jokingly \u201cthreaten\u201d anybody who objects.

Do not get into the details, your other obligations don\u2019t allow you to do it.  If she asks more, tell her you don\u2019t want to get into the details, but you wanted to give her time to find someone else.  You\u2019ve grown away from this person, but you\u2019re only starting to realize it now!", "Seriously, having to go to one party more than the wedding is the absolute max in my world.

OP Don\u2019t you dare give a gift. Certainly not $500! This person is unapologetically completely taking advantage of the people supposedly closest to her in such a despicable way. I wouldn\u2019t go or send a gift. If you want to go solely to see if any drunken groomsmen shoot themselves trying to do a Congo line then pay the cost of your plate and not a penny more. These people are horrible and don\u2019t deserve it.", "How many accidental gun deaths come from what people thought were unloaded guns?  The first thing responsible gun owners learn is NEVER to point a gun at anyone in jest.", "Sometimes people request cash donations for the honeymoon or a house downpayment but it is in lieu of gifts.

Also tacky to state the amount that is to be donated.", ">Please tell me none of the guns are going to be loaded.\n\nRule one of gun safety is \"the gun is always loaded\".

The bride is 24! How many 24 year olds are financially secure enough absent help from parents to throw away what I\u2019m assuming will be closer to $4-5k on someone else\u2019s stupid wedding?", "Yes, people can\u2019t really see sense around weddings. My advice was to offer $500 if money was no issue (compared to like $4k we\u2019re looking at on that expenses list, it\u2019s a steal), and if it was an issue to just say it\u2019s the money thing.

Deep cringey shudder.", "Few women do, it\u2019s just those are the ones you hear about because it plays into the Bridezilla trope and people love to hate on women\n\nAlso, if the bride is acting this way, 95% of the time the groom is complicit.", "No, no we're not. Not because of this wedding (most Americans would agree it's an insane idea) but just... everything else.", "It\u2019s like a man\u2019s groom shower. Except he gets things to help with his honey-do-this and honey-do-that lists.", "I mean, it's downright dangerous with the gun aspect, so judge away, I say. Plus, the booze part ALSO sounds dangerous if the wedding party has to do potentially 10+ shots before the reception.\n\nI think this is the right time to be judgmental because the entire idea sounds potentially dangerous.", "I grew up with gun-loving rednecks.  I was taught to respect guns and not use them as toys or props.  \n\nThese aren't responsible gun people.   They're fools.", "10/10", "[removed]", "This sounds like a really upsetting sequel to that Steve Martin movie.", "This wedding sounds tacky as hell.  I wouldn't even touch it with a ten foot pole and attend as a guest, let alone be in the wedding party.

This wedding for a year stuff is getting out of hand.", "My sister had to switch to a simple bachelorette due to Covid, we just went out for dinner, but the original plan had been a weekend trip to tour some wineries. BUT she had already made it clear she was paying her own way and that if you couldn\u2019t make it for whatever reason, that was fine. She also didn\u2019t want any other activities we were forced to pay for.

He probably knows some shit.", "Requesting ur bridesmaids to get you a gift off the registry AND donate to your honeymoon is not only uncouth but unhinged. My bridesmaids will be spending enough time/money by participating, gifts are not needed or expected. \n\nBut on the more reasonable end, I've donated to serval honeymoon funds in lieu of a gift. A wedding I'm going to this summer actually has no gift registry just options on honeyfund ranging from $20 to $150 (honeyfund is a website where your guests can't contribute to specific parts of ur honeymoon, flight, hotel, drinks, excursions, ect)", "Donate to the honeymoon _and_ buy  gift of min. $150 value. No. A donation to the honeymoon _is_ a gift and people should get to choose how much they give. \n\nThis absolutely sounds like a 1) a cash grab from the bride, and 2) a 'one up' wedding that's all about outdoing whatever else the bride has seen on tiktok, not a celebration of love and commitment.", "AND a gift from the registry??", "I feel like there\u2019s zero chance that all of those guns are unloaded.", "And who may or may not be very drunk.", "I feel ya, but I\u2019m working on the assumption that the wilder ideas are coming from the groom, and the bride is someone long term in OP\u2019s life that she really values.

I was just trying to give benefit of the doubt.", "The greediness is just as much if not more on the bride. I\u2019m sure the groom doesn\u2019t care about dresses, hair and makeup, week long destination bachelorette parties and I\u2019d be shocked if he knew what half the pre wedding events listed even are beyond a shower.
