Plus - it also gives \"a reward\" to parent, seeing their kid's progress.   \nI teached my both sons to read, when they were on the pre-school level.

I excelled as a student but always was bored and felt held back. I primarily want to allow my kid(s) to learn as much and as fast as they want, while ensuring a minimum in all subjects. \n\nTo me, your calculations don\u2019t account for a lot of logistics and the effects of large classes. Divide your instruction time by 35 students, and subtract all the time to go from class to class and break up fights. I don\u2019t plan to use that to calculate some false low number so I only need to interact for an hour, but no kid gets 6-8 hours of actual instruction per day in public school. \n\nAdd in I\u2019m in Florida, so the new king of bad public school systems. \n\nAdd in I LOVE learning enough that I would be a teacher if that wouldn\u2019t probably suck, and I \u2026 test well, we will just say.

Ask your daughter about her struggles and how you can assist her.  She already feels like a failure beating it into her won\u2019t help.

She can also enroll him into online school with an actual teacher instead of teaching him herself and you can offer to help with homework and tutoring.", ">she gets mad at me when I try to teach him though.\n\nWhat exactly is she mad about?\n\nI would reframe what you are doing to yourself as reading to him, and exploring numbers. Start by embedding concepts, try to make it fun and have him laughing (yes, laughing will help him learn). Make him feel good about learning, don't focus on what he can't do. \n\nIf she has any issues with any of the following, then the situation is truly bad:\n\nReading and spelling:\n\nRead to him, running your finger smoothly under the words as you read them. Keep your finger movement fluid, you don't want to train his eye to stop at each word, but you do want to connect the words on the page with the sounds you are making. The phonics will then teach themselves, and his spelling will improve with exposure to the written word. \n\nMath:\n\nYou want to get the big picture across: math is how we model the world. We use integers to count, and do all sorts of things. We have operations that allow us to calculate  (+ - / x).\n\nMath give us power. We can use numbers and equations to model single objects, groups, measures (length, weight). It doesn't matter whether we are talking about slices of pizza or cups of water, the math works. Numbers have a magnitude, and we can show them on a number line. You can use a number line to ground harder concepts like fractions and negative numbers.\n\nGet him to show you on a number line what happens for fun fantasy situations where you would add and subtract, multiply and divide.\n\nMessage me privately if you like.", "Have you asked your daughter about her educational philosophy?

Schools have guidance counselors, on-staff nurses, physical education- if your child ends up having any speech-related issues or physical issues, public schools often are able to supply free service for speech therapy and sometimes physical therapy.
