As he's been getting older, other people have started to call him \"Mike\", but I don't like it, so I try to correct people whenever I can. For the record, I've asked Michael about this, and he said he doesn't really care.\n\nI went to a parent-teacher conference the recently, and the teacher kept referring to him as \"Mike,\" even after I'd corrected him at the beginning of the meeting. I was complaining to my partner about it, who didn't think it was a big deal, but I wasn't happy that my wishes were basically being ignored. My partner then said it was ridiculous to insist on Michael never going by a nickname his entire life, and that it's a losing battle. I said it would be nice to have some support from him on this, and he looked at me like I was crazy... I told him I wasn't going to back down on this, and that if he were more open to correcting people too, then it would be more likely to stick.\n\nHe said I'm being overdramatic, and that I can't control what other people do. I got upset with him, and we agreed to stop talking about it and collect our thoughts before discussing it again at a later point so things wouldn't escalate into a fight. \n\nSome of my friends also think I'm being a controlling AH, while others are saying that my partner is being really unsupportive. I understand that my partner thinks this is a trivial thing, but in some ways that upsets me even more, as I would hope he would be able to see that this is something that matters to me and would be willing to have my back.

At least around here, that's common practice. The teacher asks the kids at the beginning of the year, and they usually use that name. \n\nAlthough he told you he \"doesn't really care\" could he actually like Mike, but is afraid to tell you so?

As he's been getting older, other people have started to call him \"Mike\", but I don't like it, so I try to correct people whenever I can. For the record, I've asked Michael about this, and he said he doesn't really care.\n\nI went to a parent-teacher conference the recently, and the teacher kept referring to him as \"Mike,\" even after I'd corrected him at the beginning of the meeting. I was complaining to my partner about it, who didn't think it was a big deal, but I wasn't happy that my wishes were basically being ignored. My partner then said it was ridiculous to insist on Michael never going by a nickname his entire life, and that it's a losing battle. I said it would be nice to have some support from him on this, and he looked at me like I was crazy... I told him I wasn't going to back down on this, and that if he were more open to correcting people too, then it would be more likely to stick.\n\nHe said I'm being overdramatic, and that I can't control what other people do. I got upset with him, and we agreed to stop talking about it and collect our thoughts before discussing it again at a later point so things wouldn't escalate into a fight. \n\nSome of my friends also think I'm being a controlling AH, while others are saying that my partner is being really unsupportive. I understand that my partner thinks this is a trivial thing, but in some ways that upsets me even more, as I would hope he would be able to see that this is something that matters to me and would be willing to have my back. AITA for insisting that my son not be called by a nickname?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Mike said himself he doesn't care. It is his name that people refer to when referencing him. I get you made and him and gave him the name, but he is now a separate person from you who can make his own choices on a nickname. You are throwing some serious narcissistic red flags here. \nTDLR it's Mike's name, not yours.", "YTA but l have a genuine question. If at some point your son decides he wants to be called \"Mike\", will you respect that? Or will you continue with \"Michael\" because that's what you prefer?", "OP if Mike doesn't mind then all is OK in the world.", "YTA. \n\nMike doesn't care. It's his name, and his opinion that matters.  \n\nHonestly if you really wanted your kid to only go by his given name and never a nickname, why on earth did you go with Michael? That's one of the most commonly nicknamed names out there.", "Your son is old enough to decide what he is called. If he doesn\u2019t care, why do you? It\u2019s not your name. YTA let it go", "You are the only one insisting that he can only be called by his full name. If he, himself, was the one behind the sentiment I would understand. My husbands name is Michael NEVER EVER mike, but that\u2019s HIS rule. Not his moms, make sense?", "Mike wants to be called Mike. That's why people are calling him that at school. He tells you he doesn't care because he knows you've got a chip on your shoulder about it and he doesn't want the confrontation, but he doesn't want to completely agree with you ever. This is a really dumb hill to die on tbh, maybe you need a hobby or something.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  Stop embarrassing your son.", "YTA- Your son is old enough to decide if he does or does not want to be called by a nickname. If he does not have an issue with it neither should you, it\u2019s his name.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide that. In what world did you think he would not end up being called Mike?", "YTA. Your husband \"looked at you like you were crazy\" because you're acting crazy. Please get some help.", "YTA. Just wait til he brings a gf home who calls him \"Mikey.\" Also, your friends who are saying your husband is being un supportive. You might want to be careful with their advice. Egging on a fight over *this* really sounds more like biased opinionated perspectives than level-headed neutral rational.", "YTA what matters is what your son feels about it. It\u2019s a common name and you should have considered that this would happen and you wouldn\u2019t have any control over it. Is this really worth starting fights over?", "YTA. I don't usually say this because I'm histrionic af and have no room to talk, but yes, you *are* being overdramatic.", "If Mike doesn\u2019t care. Why are you getting so worked up over it? Why are you so upset?\n\nYou really need to let this go. Are you still going to correct people when he\u2019s an adult? \n\nYTA", "YTA you don't actually get to decide if your son goes by a nickname. He does. My grandma did that shit to my uncle. She's been dead over 10 years and we still make fun of her for how entitled it was. Do you want that to be you?", "YTA, OP. He's out of the womb and operating in the world. He's going to be exposed to ideas you do not like, people you don't approve of, have interests you wish he wouldn't, love people you have issues with, and so forth. Oh, and he's going to do a lot of this in a sphere you can't even see or know about. Boo hoo for you, I'm betting that will be hard. \n\nYou really need to let this go. If Mikey boy had responded that he very much cared to be called Michael, you'd have half a leg to stand on (but it would still largely be up to him to express his preferences, and THEN you'd back him up if need be), but he didn't and you're upside down in a hole you insist on digging ever deeper. \n\nIt's weirdly controlling, to try to determine how other people address your son. \n\nI hope he decides to call himself Mikki or something like that, just to spite you.", "My grandma didn't like nicknames, she gave my mom and her siblings names that couldn't really be shortened (Ruth, Laura, Martha, John) Martha still went by Marty sometimes. My mom also didn't like nicknames. My and my brother address Laura and John. \nI, however, hated NOT having the options, so my kids all have names that can be shortened to some degree: Elizabeth (only goes by Ellie and refuses to acknowledge her full name) Gregory (goes by Greg or Gregory interchangeably) Jacob (goes by Jacob, though a few of his friends call him Jake) and Brenna (Brenna, B, Bear) \nAs parents, My husband and I discussed if we wanted our kids to go by nicknames when we named them. If you don't like nicknames, you should have gone with a different name. YTA", "YTA. Your son doesn\u2019t care.

Mike is a different name and even though it's a common nickname doesn't mean you agree to change it. However, I don't think others calling him Mike is malicious or AH behavior either. \n\nI just saw an interview with Matthew McConaughey where his mother would correct people (when he was a boy) who called him Matt. I totally see your side of this.", ">My partner then said it was ridiculous to insist on Michael never going by a nickname his entire life, and that it's a losing battle.\n\nSo this is not true. I like my full name and I can't stand the common nicknames for my name so I always make it that clear when someone tries to use one with me.\n\nThat said, while I was the one objecting to being called a nickname in this case your son doesn't seem to care. It should really be his decision. That said, NAH.", "NTA.  My daughter is Elizabeth NOT Beth or Liz or Lizzie etc!!!", "Yeah your kid is old enough to know his own name.  If he was young enough to not know his name yet, you\u2019d have a leg to stand on.\nHe is 8 - if he does not care he does not care and you certainly can\u2019t stop other kids calling him Mike, Mikey or any other thing.", "Oh, I'm sure OP will give it the old college try though.", "To be honest, he probably prefers Mike but doesn\u2019t want to tell his mom!", "Once you give your kids a name, they can do what they like with it.

Will she be going into his classrooms, job, dates...? Lol.", "I\u2019d add that I grew up with a VERY common name when I was a kid - my last name is lower in the alphabet, and I often was asked by teachers if a nickname was OK - there are 2 common ones for my name - I was good with one and not the other, and from Kindergarten on, I was very direct about that. Your son, like me, gets to choose - not a teacher and not you.", "I think this is a very important point in regards to the teacher, so thanks for making it. Teachers always (at least should always) ask children what they go by. I\u2019d guess the teacher calls him Mike because he calls himself Mike as do his classmates.", "Yeah, unless there are several Michaels in class/workplace and people call them Mike vs Michael to differentiate, it's very likely that he'll be called Mike for the rest of his life.", "I like the word \"nicknameable\". \ud83d\ude42", "*it's Michael*", "Why does it matter so much though.... like WHY", ">So this is not true. \n\nYes, it is. You are not Michael. Michael has already stated that he doesn't care.", "But WHY? Let your daughter decide... its HER name not yours.", "Probably all through college.", "Totally agree.", "Especially if the teacher is using a nickname. They always ask on the first day and write down preferred name (Mike, michael, mikey, etc). And they are pretty great at keeping up with yhe preference, specifically in elementary school (8 years old), when they likely only see one class all day every week", "Possibly. This sort of thing really can get out of hand.", "Then post college, OP will be correcting whomever she encounters."]}
