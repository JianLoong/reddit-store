As he's been getting older, other people have started to call him \"Mike\", but I don't like it, so I try to correct people whenever I can. For the record, I've asked Michael about this, and he said he doesn't really care.\n\nI went to a parent-teacher conference the recently, and the teacher kept referring to him as \"Mike,\" even after I'd corrected him at the beginning of the meeting. I was complaining to my partner about it, who didn't think it was a big deal, but I wasn't happy that my wishes were basically being ignored. My partner then said it was ridiculous to insist on Michael never going by a nickname his entire life, and that it's a losing battle. I said it would be nice to have some support from him on this, and he looked at me like I was crazy... I told him I wasn't going to back down on this, and that if he were more open to correcting people too, then it would be more likely to stick.\n\nHe said I'm being overdramatic, and that I can't control what other people do. I got upset with him, and we agreed to stop talking about it and collect our thoughts before discussing it again at a later point so things wouldn't escalate into a fight. \n\nSome of my friends also think I'm being a controlling AH, while others are saying that my partner is being really unsupportive. I understand that my partner thinks this is a trivial thing, but in some ways that upsets me even more, as I would hope he would be able to see that this is something that matters to me and would be willing to have my back.

At least around here, that's common practice. The teacher asks the kids at the beginning of the year, and they usually use that name. \n\nAlthough he told you he \"doesn't really care\" could he actually like Mike, but is afraid to tell you so?

As he's been getting older, other people have started to call him \"Mike\", but I don't like it, so I try to correct people whenever I can. For the record, I've asked Michael about this, and he said he doesn't really care.\n\nI went to a parent-teacher conference the recently, and the teacher kept referring to him as \"Mike,\" even after I'd corrected him at the beginning of the meeting. I was complaining to my partner about it, who didn't think it was a big deal, but I wasn't happy that my wishes were basically being ignored. My partner then said it was ridiculous to insist on Michael never going by a nickname his entire life, and that it's a losing battle. I said it would be nice to have some support from him on this, and he looked at me like I was crazy... I told him I wasn't going to back down on this, and that if he were more open to correcting people too, then it would be more likely to stick.\n\nHe said I'm being overdramatic, and that I can't control what other people do. I got upset with him, and we agreed to stop talking about it and collect our thoughts before discussing it again at a later point so things wouldn't escalate into a fight. \n\nSome of my friends also think I'm being a controlling AH, while others are saying that my partner is being really unsupportive. I understand that my partner thinks this is a trivial thing, but in some ways that upsets me even more, as I would hope he would be able to see that this is something that matters to me and would be willing to have my back. AITA for insisting that my son not be called by a nickname?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
