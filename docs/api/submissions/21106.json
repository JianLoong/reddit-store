I have always been close with my siblings, so my sisters will be maids and my brother is officiating. At the start of planning FH asked if I was going to ask his sister to be a maid, and I said no. He was fine with it. Since the start of us dating they haven\u2019t seemed close, and would only see each other for holidays and occasional family dinners.\n\r\nFHs sister and I don\u2019t have a relationship, and at the start of my relationship with FH she was mean and dismissive of me.

I added everything hoping that it would just make everyone happy. \n\r\nWe are 3 mos away from the wedding now. FHs father writes him a long text saying that he\u2019s having trouble sleeping, has terrible headaches, and gets physically ill every time he thinks/talks about our wedding because FHs sister isn\u2019t a bridesmaid. FH tells me that he\u2019s made a mistake and now wants his sister to be a bridesmaid.\n\r\nI said no, and politely explained to FH that I feel like your maids should be your ride-or-die people. I have two best friends (15+ yrs), my 2 sisters, and another best friend of 5 yrs. All of whom  I feel like love, and support me and us. I told him that since his sister and I don\u2019t have a close relationship I didn\u2019t feel right having her as a bridesmaid.\n\r\nI tried to compromise and tell FH that his sister can stand on his side with the groomsmen, do a reading during the ceremony, or anything else really. He believes this will send the wrong message and basically make the whole wedding think that I don\u2019t like her. \n\r\nHe thinks I\u2019m making a huge mistake and that the people I have up there with me might not be around forever, but his sister will be.

You've already compromised, they want more. They'll just keep moving the goal post and you'll never make them happy, even if you do every single thing they want, at the cost of your happiness on YOUR wedding day.

Three months to go is a little late to be changing people around and then having to ask one of the bridesmaids to step down.\nMore worrying, though, is that your husband has said he will opt not to do something to help you or your parents in the future in retaliation for not including his sister. This is how your marriage is starting off. He is literally blackmailing you. It doesn\u2019t sound like he is your ride or die person.\nNTA", "NTA. Your fh is not standing up for you.  This will not get better. What will happen with his family if yall decide to have kids?  It seems as if his family will always come first.  He has already threatened not to help your family in the future if you dont bow down to him and his families demands. \n\nYall can try couples counseling but I think you need to put on the brakes to this marriage for awhile.   Its easier to step back now then it will be if yall are married", "Nta. Your fiance sounds like a dick. Also, his dad losing sleep and getting sick when he thinks about his daughter not being in your wedding is soo over dramatic and weird. I wouldn't want any part in that family.", "NTA. your F doesn't seem very supportive.\n\nINFO: Is he bending over backwards to accommodate anything, or just expecting you to do that, and if so, does he have a history of that?", "ESH\n\nI will probably get downvoted for this and that's fine.\n\nI think everyone is making too much out of the significance of bridesmaids. I think your FIL is acting crazy about it, like if his daughter isn't one of your bridesmaids, the world will end. I think you are drawing a hard line here, like if your SIL stands on your side of the aisle versus your husband's, the world will end.\n\nWhat I would really be concerned about? That would be the super creepy revenge statements your future husband made at the end of your posts. Might want to reconsider whether you want to marry him... much more concerning than who stands up there in an ugly bridesmaid dress...\n\nBut as for bridesmaids... if this were a normal family I would have no problem adding another bridesmaid even if it were someone I was not particularly close to, simply because it was my future husband's sister. Whether or not you are besties, if you and your husband do not divorce, she will be in your life for 50-60 years. To me, that's worth keeping the peace to have her stand up there on your side of the aisle for half an hour of the ceremony. And it's worth keeping the peace with your in laws.\n\nIn this case, as I said before, you have MUCH bigger problems--your creepy fianc\u00e9 who thinks in terms of how he will get revenge on you any time you don't do exactly as he wants you to. YIKES. RED FLAGS!!", "NTA. It's your wedding, not theirs. You've conceded enough to them as it is. You're right that your bridesmaids should be your ride-or-die people. No one is entitled to be in anyone's wedding party.\nStand your ground. If you cave now, it'll never stop.", "NTA - It's your wedding, not theirs. Put your foot down and say no, and if your FH is so set on having his sister there she can be one of his groomsmen.\n\nYour bridesmaids are your ride-or-die friends, and they are the ones that will still be there even if the marriage blows up. Pick your own support group and leave SIL out of it.", "NTA. Don't let FH or FFIL let you think otherwise. They cannot dictate to you who to have as Bridesmaids...it is YOUR decision and your decision alone.\n\nAlso tell FMIL it's YOUR Wedding and only you and your FH will decide on what the day will look like and who will be invited.\n\nYou need to start setting boundaries as soon as possible, things will only get worse the longer you leave it.", "So your marrying someone spineless, who won't stand up for you to his family? Not a good idea. Stand up for yourself! NTA", "NTA - are you absolutely sure you want to be in this family? It sounds like you will forever be the only one who compromises \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA.

This man is saying his sister, who hasn't bothered to treat you with any respect, will be there for you *over* *your own sisters and friends*, who love you, and then he's going on to say he will hold you not having his sister in your bridal party over your head *for the rest of your life.*  And doing the emotionally manipulative \"if you loved me, you would...\" dance.\n\nAll this aside from his controlling, manipulative (wonder how he got that way!) parents.\n\nIf you marry this man, especially under these circumstances, you will never again have a moment's peace.  If you don't do exactly what his parents want, they'll have literal tantrums over it.  If you don't do exactly what he wants, he will manipulate you and retaliate against you for it.\n\nOP, this is not normal behavior from someone who should love you.  He should be standing up for you against his sister's disrespect and his parents' unreasonable demands, not demanding you give in to them.  But you're lucky: they're doing you the extraordinary favor of showing you their true colors while it is still easy for you to get away from them.  Take this opportunity!  It will be so much harder to get away when you have to go through a whole divorce and splitting up of assets, especially if children are in the mix.  Even if you lose every penny you put out for this wedding, it will be cheaper in the long run for you to walk away now.\n\nNTA.\n\n(Edited for judgment)", "Been married 14 years.

Think long and hard about this.", "And yet, he\u2019s showing you how he\u2019ll respond to pressure and stress, something that will happen a lot because life is life. I thought my ex husband would get better at communication, would learn how to handle stress better, be kinder - nope.\n\nDo you want kids? Imagine how he\u2019ll be with his mom and dad\u2019s demands while you have a newborn.\n\nHe\u2019s NOT on your team, he\u2019s on THEIR team. Please consider finding better", "His threat was neither sweet nor understanding. That\u2019s a really terrible thing to say to your future spouse.", "Um, seriously?!  The entire family sounds like a bunch of narcissistic control freaks!  Who wants to be in the wedding of someone they don't know or respect *this* badly?  Why would FFIL be having migraines and not sleeping over his daughter not being in the wedding of someone she hardly knows?  Why would OP's fiance, who presumably loves her, threaten to hold this over her head *for the rest of her life?*  And what's up with that BS about his sister--who insults her--being there for OP over her own friends and family?!\n\nIf this was a normal family, maybe compromise (like she hasn't compromised enough?) would smooth things over.  But this isn't a normal family!  She shouldn't give in--she should flee for the hills!", "Oh. I thought we just said fianc\u00e9 for that. I was so confused lol. Thanks!"]}
