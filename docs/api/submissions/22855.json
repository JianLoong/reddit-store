I had to fight a laugh and be like \"lady he's deaf, he never heard you, he wasn't ignoring you on purpose.\" \n\nSo she turns around beet-red, and screams into the parking lot \"I'M SORRY\" and I had to tell her again, without laughing, that he was deaf and obviously couldn't hear her from across the parking lot.....", "I love stories like this.
