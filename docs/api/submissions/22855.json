I didn\u2019t call it mean to do what OP did, only that it was in OP\u2019s power to not let it get this far, and that it was understandable from OP POV, to be frustrated, and make the lazy entitled girl to actually come over before acknowledging her.it\u2019s like calling BS if I said they didn\u2019t win a race when they finished dead last."]}
