I had to fight a laugh and be like \"lady he's deaf, he never heard you, he wasn't ignoring you on purpose.\" \n\nSo she turns around beet-red, and screams into the parking lot \"I'M SORRY\" and I had to tell her again, without laughing, that he was deaf and obviously couldn't hear her from across the parking lot.....", "I love stories like this.

Then the teacher was absent for 2 weeks for sensitivity training. \n\nBeing a class full o 7th graders, we all thought it was hilarious. \n\nFor my part I had a similar incident with TSA. My perception was I'm packing up my stuff that I can't move to a packing table due to a wrist injury. It's crowded  AF and noisy so everything is kinda blending together. If you've seen the charlie brown cartoons, the teachers' \"Mwom Mwom Mwom Mwom mowm\" is actually pretty close to how I perceive someone talking in that sort of environment since I'm not presently a candidate for hearing aids for reasons I don't understand (something something mix of loss types and low pain threshold? Plus a bunch of other medical jargonese). I had HoH stamped on my boarding pass and the TSA body scanner people did a decent job of facing me so I could lip read and waving at me to let me know when I could leave the scanner. \n\nI get an additional scan because the brace on my wrist tripped an alarm, that goes well, too. \n\nOff I go to pick up luggage. I can't use the packing table because that'd require 2 functional hands to carry my shit over so I bring as much over to the end as possible and am packing up as quickly as I can with one functional arm. The \"Mwom Mwom\"ing \ngets louder. I assume since I've disclosed my disability everyone around me knows they need to wave at me to get my attention since I'm HoH and have PTSD, so I assume they're talking to someone else. \n\nIt gets more insistant. Meanwhile I'm just frantically trying to get my computer to cooperate for me and get into my bag so I can quit being an obstruction because it is *packed*. Again, I assume I told everyone repeatedly I'm HoH and can't hear if I can't see their face so it's not for me. \n\nSuddenly, someone grabs my upper arm and spins me around forcefully. I am very glad in retrospect that I am a dumpy 30something white woman in a business suit and not someone younger or racialized because I nearly shoved the person before I saw the TSA print on their front and if I'd had different demographics I'm pretty sure the agent would've tested to see if my nose was stronger than the tile floor. \n\n\"Are you DEAF?! Move your stuff! Use the packing table!\"\n\n\"Sort of. 40%. And I can't.\" I hold up my braced arm with my obviously bruised and swollen fingers sticking out of the brace like purple and blue mottled sausages. \n\nShe continued to be an ass interrogating me about how I could understand her now (because I lip read) and why I didn't have assistance (because frankly I find it easier to navigate on my own and because I hate waiting around for the airline staff to arrive so if I think I can manage on my own I prefer to, not that it's any of your business), why I'm not wearing hearing aids (not a candidate, not that it's any of your business), why I didn't disclose sooner (I did to your colleagues, it's on my boarding pass, *and* I couldn't hear you) and telling me my disability is no excuse it's my job to obey a lawful order (if I can, sure. It's not willful disobedience, it's that I couldn't hear and even if I could I can't physically obey. Now, if you want to help me move my stuff I'm happy to get out of the way, but I can't lift a tray with this hand. Doctor's orders.).\n\nSo then she stood over me barking at me to hurry up as I packed up and got myself scarce. At least until another passenger had the balls to tell her to back off and offered me help. \n\nI did file a complaint because while my hearing loss isn't obvious, my injury sure as hell was AND she had no right to continue to interrogate me about the nature of my disability after I disclosed it. \n\nAs an afterthought: if you're HoH, avoid Atlanta's airport. It's neither the first nor the last time I've had issues getting proper accommodations there. I've never not had issues there. \n\nO'Hare, OTOH, despite being a miserable rat warren of an airport, is actually pretty good, and so are both Newark and La Guardia.

Like, as the civilian traveler here I shouldn't be the one actively de-escalating someone who's looking for a fight.

No, not at all. \n\nDid the person who started this thread agree with OP that OP\u2019s method of dealing with Lily was the more appropriate method in this case? Yes, totally.\n\nWas I only pointing out that this was the meaning behind the first message in this thread, and thus downvoting it and challenging it\u2019s validity was unnecessary? Yes, because the actual message agreed with the majority.\n\nWas the second part of my message a generalization saying that sometimes it\u2019s okay to act in a bad way to prove a point? Yes, I wasn\u2019t being specific, I was making a general point.\n\nDo I think OP was completely in the right? Totally and 100%.\n\nAm I also hard of hearing? Yes. It\u2019s actually a genetic problem in my family. Nana, mother, myself, and my niece. \n\nDo I wish I didn\u2019t have to explain this whole thing? Yes. Very much so. Why can\u2019t people take the phrase \u201cdeliciously evil\u201d and interpret it as the clearly positive compliment it is? You don\u2019t call something delicious if you\u2019re against it. Sometimes being a little evil is fun. Evil here is being used hyperbolically. I\u2019m not talking about evil like murdering children, I\u2019m talking about evil, like when someone says \u201ccan I go to the bathroom\u201d and you reply \u201cI don\u2019t know, *can* you?\u201d Because \u2018can\u2019 is grammatically incorrect and they should have used the word \u2018may\u2019 and so you\u2019re being a little evil to them.

The teacher needs to be more authoritative and discipline Lily appropriately for her poor behavior. Her entitled behavior is unacceptable and inexcusable in any setting, and should not be tolerated.

I\u2019m saying what she did was **fun**, the kind of thing we would all love to do to someone screaming at us from across a room.

And someone took umbrage with that. Why? It\u2019s technically true. OP *could* have been nicer. Doesn\u2019t mean they *should* have been. Neither I nor the person I spoke up to defend are saying that. It\u2019s just a technicality. OP admits freely that they *could* hear Lily, and did in fact choose to ignore her until she came stomping over to confront OP directly. At which point OP took out their hearing aids and slipped them on and shamed Lily to hell. It is so delicious, such just deserts, just absolutely the most amazingly sly response to such an utter bint. \u2026but it\u2019s anything but being *nice*, and I 100% *support* it. \n\nBut I at least can *admit* it. If you have yourself fooled into thinking OP was being *nice*, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your mind. But, and please excuse the hyperbole (see definition above) to me that was the most wonderfully sly marvellous beautiful delicious piece of evil I\u2019ve had the joy of reading about in a long while.
