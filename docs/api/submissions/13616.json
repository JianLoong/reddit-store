My aunts, uncles, and two cousins, Lily (19) and Jackson (22), were there. I always got along well with Lily growing up. Jackson, on the other hand, is one of the worst people I've ever had the misfortune of knowing. He is the eldest cousin and the biggest bully.\n\nJackson would take any opportunity to hurt us as kids. His sister and I were his main targets, but our youngest cousins soon became targets too. Someone was injured and crying at every event he attended. No matter what he did or how badly he hurt someone, his parents would never discipline him. I used to cry in the bathroom at every family gathering because of him.\n\nLast Christmas, we had dinner at my grandmother's house. I was seated next to Jackson. He scrolled through Lily's Instagram and rated every girl on her feed throughout the meal. He was judging his sister's friends as if they were cuts of meat. It took everything I had to keep from going insane from what he was saying. I was disgusted.\n\nI finally snapped yesterday. We were all seated and talking. My aunts and uncles were all questioning Jackson's job and studies. He and Lily are both engineering students, and he would make jabs at her as he responded, saying things like, \"Lily would never be able to do something like that. She's an idiot.\" Then they brought up his recent birthday party. I was the only one who didn't show up.\n\nMy aunt asked me why I didn't attend. I didn't want to start anything, so I made up an excuse about being swamped with schoolwork. He then took a jab at Lily again, saying, \"Even if Lily studied that hard, she'd never finish anything worth submitting.\" This was my last straw. I simply turned to him and said something along the lines of, \u201cYou know what? I didn't attend your party because I don't like you. I never have, and if you keep up your disgusting attitude, it'll only be a matter of time before everyone else feels the same way.\u201d\n\nThe silence in the room became awkward. I couldn't tell if Jackson was sad, angry, or both. He didn't say anything. My aunt was livid and told me that what I said was inappropriate and that I should apologize. I just said I'd do it when he apologizes to each of us cousins, especially his sister, for inflicting years of torment on all of us. I left because everyone started arguing.\n\nWhen I left, I was embarrassed yet proud of myself, but now I'm not so sure. My aunt called my mom and told her what had happened. My mom is furious. She told me that I could have simply held my tongue or approached the situation in a less aggressive manner. My dad said that my bitterness ruined what should have been a pleasant evening for my grandmother. I feel so bad now. The words were spoken before I could even think about them. Everybody is waiting for me to apologize now. Should I apologize? I don't know what to feel.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680240099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127b4qw/aita_for_telling_my_18f_cousin_22m_that_i_dont/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Is Jackson the oldest boy? Some sort of heir apparent?) But they sure did a good job building a bully. Good for you for drawing a line in the sand.\n\nNTA\n\nPS You didn't \"ruin grandmother's evening\", don't worry, old people are tough", "Everyone else is trying to keep that boat stable while he rocks the heck out of it.

If your uncle and aunt don't see it as an issue, evacuate lily asap", "NTA\u2026.all of the adults in that room owe every one of you girls an apology. They allowed that shit to bully you all for years. Most of them did it I\u2019m sure out of wanting to keep the peace but didn\u2019t realize at what cost. If anything I would write all of them a letter for handling the years of pain that way. Something like \u201cIt was never my intent to make the family uncomfortable. However, it always hurt us girls that another family member was allowed to do psychological damage at will while no adult protected us. So as I sat there listening to him disrespect girls one after another and treat my cousin who I love dearly like she is worthless again out came many years of frustration. Again, I do apologize for handling myself in that way. However, I need every adult to sit and think about the awful amount of pain that was allowed to be given onto us girls. This may be hard to hear and I get that but until now nobody was allowed a voice other than Jackson until it screamed at you to hear it.\u201d", "NTA Personally I would've snapped and said the same thing. People need to be told they suck sometimes to know they need to do better. It's beyond me that they would let him bully her like that without saying anything. Good on you for defending them and letting him knows he's the AH.", "Definitively NTA\nJeeez i wish i could see his face when you told him.\nBtw you did good i'm proud of you", "NTA, but your parents, aunts, uncles, and Jackson sure are. You have nothing to apologize for. Everyone else who allowed Jackson to openly insult his sister, torment his cousins, and have let this sexist, golden child bullshit to continue for as long as it has need to apologize.", "Well this is a trainwreck of a family mess, and an inevitability. NTA for saying it, something like this was inevitable, and his parents are horrible if the issues have been so consistent", "I\u2019m not one to say if you were or were not the AH. But I will say I don\u2019t blame you one bit. Why is his actions overlooked? Why is he allowed to, in-front of his own parents, call his sister stupid? Why is he being coddled? \n\nI think it\u2019s good someone called him the kind of jerk he is at least once. Sometimes being a bit of an AH is necessary when you\u2019re dealing with an AH. I wouldn\u2019t apologize. And I\u2019ll say it here, I\u2019m proud of you. Just try not to make outbursts a normal thing.", "NTA. \n\nI'm sure Lily is grateful you stood up for her. It's sad that she doesn't get that kind of support from your family when they're hearing these comments made by him. \n\nHim rating the girls was also absolutely vile too. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Good for you for speaking up. It\u2019s not your job to keep the peace", "NTA.\n\n[don't rock the boat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/77w8lf/dont_rock_the_boat/)", "This. Maybe check in with your grandma but don\u2019t apologize. Stand your ground", "If Lily isn\u2019t mad (I\u2019m assuming not since you stood up for her), then the only person you may want to consider apologizing to is your grandmother. You definitely don\u2019t owe Jackson an apology, and you don\u2019t owe the parents an apology because they raised this monster.\n\nWhat you did may have been the wake up call Jackson needed. Hopefully, he\u2019s thinking about his choices in life now.", "So no one has spoken to your cousin about the bullying and gone straight in on you for daring to bring it up. That's because they have probably noticed his behaviour, and its too hard to change it now. It's much easier to get you to pretend to accept it and keep the peace. NTA. Hold your ground and, if you can, stop attending events he's at. Maybe your cousins (the non bullying kind) can go out together or \"join forces\" at events so you all have each others backs.", "Your mom is furious because she failed to protect you as a child and wants to blame you instead of taking accountability of her actions.", "NTA I had a big smile on my face reading this I was like. Ooo I can't wait till the bit she tears him down and I wasn't disappointed.\nYou know what that little MF got something nasty to say about everyone else and it's about time he got it back.\nSounds like his parents are just as stupid as him.\nThe grands in the family will be loving it, Ooo party like this hasnt been this exciting for a while they love the drama \ud83d\ude02\n\nDie on your hill girl, stick to your guns, double down on the fact his a massive arse hole and makes everyone miserable.", "Could be wrong here but if you're an only child with no siblings, it sounds like the family is really happy about having a boy, and have thus far let him do anything. NAH. I dont think you should apologize, but its doubtful your parents or relatives are going to come around.
