{"id": 22825, "submission_id": "155soi4", "title": "AITAH for telling my husband to get job?", "selftext": "My husband \"works\" for his mom's \"roofing business\". I put quotes because he doesn't actually *work*, and it's only a roofing business in name because they don't get any business, or at least it's so infrequently that you might as well say they don't. I'm talking maybe 1 job every six or so months. And he's not even the one doing the work, he just does the estimate and writes the contract. \n\nMy husband spends, without any exaggeration, 99% of his time playing video games on his PC. I'm talking 14+hrs per day, almost every day.\n\nBut- he is so entitled that he thinks that even if they do get a job, *he* shouldn't have to do *anything.* Any time he actually has something to do, he complains about it *endlessly*. He is supposed to be an estimator, meaning he needs to go out and access the roof, take pictures, discuss issues with the homeowners, and then take that information and write a contract. But he will do anything to get out of doing any of that, and whine about how he's \"part owner\" and shouldn't have to work so hard.\nHe will literally pay the crew more than their agreed upon rate to get out of doing things for them (like supply runs).\n\nThis all came to a head about 2 months ago when I blew up at him for making me responsible for everything - I'm the only one making an income, so I'm paying the mortgage and all the bills, buying all the food, etc. And I work a stressful job that has quotas, which if you do not hit every month, you are terminated. And my mental health is already extremely poor so, all this is really, *really* hard on me. *And my husband knows this*.\n\nHe had offered to start acting like a \"househusband\" and take on the duties of the home, such as cooking, cleaning, etc. I agreed that he could do this *and* roofing instead of getting a regular job, but only if he would actually commit to it. \n\nHe did not. He will not do any chores at all until I specifically ask him to, and then it's moaning and groaning the entire time. He thinks that doing one thing per day is more than enough, so if he does a load of dishes, he won't do anything else that day, and he'll expect me to praise him. \n\nSo, we got into a fight. He agreed to work harder around the house as well as look for a job.\n\nWell, it's been two months since then and he has not looked for a job. He will do the absolute bare minimum in a day. Like, he'll pull up his resume and look at it. He'll pull up Indeed or LinkedIn and pretend to browse jobs. He had the audacity to ask me to *help him do this*, like he's not a grown man in his 30s.\n\nSo, I told him he has to get a job. And that's how I now answer any question he asks me- \"get a job\". \"What can I do for you?\" \"Get a job.\" \"What do you want for dinner?\" \"Get a job.\"\n\n\nTl;dr: my husband is unemployed and has been for years. He also basically refuses to do work around the house. I answer every question he now asks with \"get a job\".

He said he wanted to apply to medical school and needed time to study for MCATs shadow doctors etc.  He applied for two cycles, fails.  Then he starts dating a girl.  He wanted to Mary her within a few months of dating.  We told him get a job first before you marry.  He refuses and gets married to this girl.  \nThen he says he wants to apply for Dental school instead.  Again he needed time to study for DATs.  He applies for two cycles and fails.  \nHe then decides he wanted children.  We tell him plz get a job first before having children.  He has a son now, no job.  Wife is taking care of child so also no job.  \nHe decides he wanted to do MBA program.  Instead of applying to a good well known program he does online no name school.  After he graduates, covid hits.  No jobs no internships.  They have second child.  \nAfter several years things are opening up and he starts applying for jobs.  But his wife decides she wants to go to nursing school.  She applies and gets in but has to move to different city.  He puts job search on hold because he wants to move to new city first.  We tell him get a job before moving.  He says no.  \nWhen he gets to new city he wanted to buy a house.  We tell him get a job first.  He says no.  They try to buy a house and no bank would loan him money.  I had to co-sign for him to get a house.  Now that he has a house he says he needs to remodel the home because it\u2019s not to his liking and it has to be his touch to make it to his liking.  He\u2019s not a contractor, he takes over 6 months remodeling.  Can\u2019t apply for job while busy remodeling.  Wife starts school. Now there are two kids to take care of so he cannot go to work.  He stays home to take care of two kids while his wife is in school.  \nWe\u2019ve sent him job opportunities, introduced him to friends who have connections in the MBA world.  He said no, he will only take a job that is 100% remote work so he can be at home taking care of kids and pay more than 100k per year.
