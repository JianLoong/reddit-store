Okay, so you won $200 for the original bet (did you get that money?).\n\nAnd to be nice, you bought everyone $200 in scratchies. Mainly just because you're lovely.\n\nAnd sore loser's not-ticket won $1000...? Just to make sure I have it all right.\n\nImo, main point is he said he didn't want it, acted like a baby so screw him - keep the money and buy him a drink in a week's time when he gets over it. \nI mean, that's really the bottom line. \n\nThe only other things I would say are - (cause tbh, I might not keep it, myself, depends on the person) - if this is going to be years of \"you stole 1000 from me\" from him, then maybe it's easier to give it to him. (Yes, you shouldn't have to do that. But at this point, you'd also be questioning why be friends with the guy in the first place - it's just that I've known people who would see it that way).\n\nOr split it 50/50, but that probably wouldn't be enough either. So... If he's a good guy deep down and just has a stupid competitive streak, but ultimately he's a redeemable character, I'd probably forgive his stupidity and just give it to him. If he's a real friend, but just a knob at the same time, then I'd forgive and give. Cause, it's no loss to me - it was meant to be his ticket anyway. \n\nBut you're certainly not obligated. The scratchie was a present, that he refused multiple times. So learn for the next time - hold onto it and don't scratch it in front of the person.

They pressured you into doing something you didn't want to do (the weigh in), you expressed fear of retaliation from the sore loser which did happen so you bought consolation prizes (tickets) to temper their reactions to your win. And after all of that, they are now giving you shit for not forcing sore loser to keep his gift even though you've offered twice AND they are hounding you to give them money? Friends don't do that to friends. This group sounds awful.", "NTA give him what you offered originally and give another scratch ticket! See if he has learned his lesson.", "Don't feel like you owe people things. You already went above and beyond. Let assholes be assholes and treat them accordingly.", "NTA Good grief, people can be greedy idiots \ud83d\ude44 You owe Mr Sore Loser nothing. Not even a moments consideration. I can't tell if you actually won the weight loss competition, but YOU bought scratchits. You GAVE them to your friends and kept the one refused. It's yours. You tried twice, fuck him. It's your money and no one's business what you do with it. Tell them you paid off a bill with the money and there isn't any left to loan. Besides that, people who borrow \"free\" money are unlikely to repay it.", "NTA. Fuck them right in the ear.", "NTA - The peanut gallery that is your friend group are ignoring the fact that sore loser voluntarily gave up all ownership interest in the ticket, because he valued his tantrum more than he valued the ticket. You offered multiple times, he refused multiple times. Do your friends even understand consent and decision making at all?", "NTA. Lose those friends.", "100% NTA", "NTA.

Technically.", "NTA. \n\nYeah, OP need to sit down with all but sore loser and talk to them about his behavior. He either needs to grow up or be out of your friend group.

Just wanted to see if others had a point.\n\nAs far as telling the \"No balls\" girl to fuck off? That would be a poor life choice. She can be frightening if she thinks something needs doing for your own good. The irritating part is that she's usually right. Better to acquiesce than make a scene in my experience.", "Oh, no.

I was playing 21 and made a $2 bet, then I would bet the $4 if I won I took the $5 chip and put it in my pocket, proceeding with the remaining 3 $1 chips.  My ex saw me winning and started doing the same thing.  Pretty quickly the entire table started doing it.  The dealer got pissed and was pulled and the new dealer chirped 'Hi everyone...when we play, we want you to leave your chips on the table'.  Pretty much everyone at the table got up and moved to another table.  At the end of the night we had won enough to pay for our move and then some.  While driving back to Placerville we looked at each other and said 'we are NEVER doing that again'.  That was the last time we gambled in Tahoe knowing how easy it is to get addicted to gambling.", "There's an [asian?] superstition if you get *too* lucky all at once, then it's very unlucky (as in fatally unlucky).", "Archer for the win!!", "You paid for it =yours,  even more do after he refused twice.

I never win, so it also reinforces my strategy of never gambling.", "Friend? Fuck that guy.", "No way anyone should coddle a grownup who behaves that way. At the most, buy him another ticket and let him try again.", "I came here to say the exact same thing. These people are not happy for you they're trying to get you to give it away to the guy who not only refused the ticket twice, but said fuck you for trying to give him one. \n\nThen after you decide to keep the money, which is yours to keep, they start asking to borrow money.
