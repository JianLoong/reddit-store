You\u2019ve given him something almost as valuable as $1,000. You\u2019ve given him a lesson in instant karma, and the quantifiable price of being a sore loser.

I suggest blocking their numbers.", "Keep them, You bought the ticket, he refused it twice and you won. Those are your money.", "NTA. Okay, so you won $200 for the original bet (did you get that money?).\n\nAnd to be nice, you bought everyone $200 in scratchies. Mainly just because you're lovely.\n\nAnd sore loser's not-ticket won $1000...? Just to make sure I have it all right.\n\nImo, main point is he said he didn't want it, acted like a baby so screw him - keep the money and buy him a drink in a week's time when he gets over it. \nI mean, that's really the bottom line. \n\nThe only other things I would say are - (cause tbh, I might not keep it, myself, depends on the person) - if this is going to be years of \"you stole 1000 from me\" from him, then maybe it's easier to give it to him. (Yes, you shouldn't have to do that. But at this point, you'd also be questioning why be friends with the guy in the first place - it's just that I've known people who would see it that way).\n\nOr split it 50/50, but that probably wouldn't be enough either. So... If he's a good guy deep down and just has a stupid competitive streak, but ultimately he's a redeemable character, I'd probably forgive his stupidity and just give it to him. If he's a real friend, but just a knob at the same time, then I'd forgive and give. Cause, it's no loss to me - it was meant to be his ticket anyway. \n\nBut you're certainly not obligated. The scratchie was a present, that he refused multiple times. So learn for the next time - hold onto it and don't scratch it in front of the person. That's the lesson I'd take from it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
