Okay, so you won $200 for the original bet (did you get that money?).\n\nAnd to be nice, you bought everyone $200 in scratchies. Mainly just because you're lovely.\n\nAnd sore loser's not-ticket won $1000...? Just to make sure I have it all right.\n\nImo, main point is he said he didn't want it, acted like a baby so screw him - keep the money and buy him a drink in a week's time when he gets over it. \nI mean, that's really the bottom line. \n\nThe only other things I would say are - (cause tbh, I might not keep it, myself, depends on the person) - if this is going to be years of \"you stole 1000 from me\" from him, then maybe it's easier to give it to him. (Yes, you shouldn't have to do that. But at this point, you'd also be questioning why be friends with the guy in the first place - it's just that I've known people who would see it that way).\n\nOr split it 50/50, but that probably wouldn't be enough either. So... If he's a good guy deep down and just has a stupid competitive streak, but ultimately he's a redeemable character, I'd probably forgive his stupidity and just give it to him. If he's a real friend, but just a knob at the same time, then I'd forgive and give. Cause, it's no loss to me - it was meant to be his ticket anyway. \n\nBut you're certainly not obligated. The scratchie was a present, that he refused multiple times. So learn for the next time - hold onto it and don't scratch it in front of the person.

You didn't deliberately do anything to upset your friend, and in fact, you went out of your way to soften the blow to him when he lost the bet, but he had to act like a big baby. I know people like this - they get all butt-hurt over some game or something & everyone goes overboard coddling them until they come around & then it feels like ***they're*** doing ***you*** a big favor, as if you apologized & they're magnanimous for deigning to accept. But, no, you're NTA, you did nothing to cause him to be upset.", "NTA fuck him.", "YTA for buying scratch tickets.", "NTA and here's a fun idea, donate the 1k$ to a charity of your choosing (if possible a tax-deductible donation). That would add another level of sulking. Also, this would probably keep the other friends happy (don't mention the deductible part).", "That doesn't sound very logical. That advice could lead to OP losing a lot of money.", "Tell me you\u2019re a gambling addict without telling me you are a gambling addict.", "Get some clothes that fit and look absolutely amazing the next time you see him.", "Come to the UK - no taxes on lottery winnings; I can't remember the exact reasoning, but it's something to do with luck. I.e., you're taxed on skills (which presumably you can market) but not on luck, which is entirely random.", "NTA-\n\nI'm a firm believer in if you put good out in the world, then good comes back to visit you. \n\nYou tried to stay out of the comp, spent $200 on scratch cards so you wouldn't profit off of your friends AND offered the card to sore loser twice. Your friends sound like enablers.", "Even more reason to not loan/give it out. Sounds like shady friends", "You can usually deduct gambling losses against winnings, so hopefully you have some dud scatchoff tickets that you didn't toss.", "What country are you in??", "[Ants!](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KRFpQuRF7YQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)", "I'd just play the lottery lol. NTA you offered twice before scratching it, it's his loss. Your friend needs to grow up.", "You might need different friends\u2026", "And don't lend any money. You won't get it back, because, \"oh, you just won a 1,000\"\n\nIn the mind of the borrower you don't need the money back since you won, you don't need it and therefore, shouldn't have to pay you back.\n\nRemind them that you got everyone a ticket. As to the guy who's now crying. Tough luck. You offered him the ticket twice and he said No both times. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add, and next time don't scream out your winnings.", "Just go out and buy another $20 ticket. When he says something just give him the new ticket. You used the old one so you got him an unused ticket like you did for everyone else. NTA", "LMAO I can tell you from professional experience that the Archer quote is also correct.", "Luck isn't logical.", "It's just hindsight bias, don't feel bad :)", "The baloney is that they advertise it at the full amount.  Lotteries operate in partnership with the state, and the taxes are automatically withheld.  Your partner won $7k, which would have been fantastic if that is what you had expected.", "In the UK you pay tax on the stake, not the winnings - so they get a small amount of tax of each ticket sold, rather than a lump sum off a few winners.", "LANAAAAAAAA!", "Right? Dude was offered the ticket *twice* and declined it. Why should it be offered a third time because it's worth money?", "\n\nEveryone knows what the stakes are for getting one so it's the same for turning it down", "Sounds like shadow marketing by the casino industry.", "Because it doesn't exist.", "No, they would be fine on this system with the sore loser guy. OP bought the scratchcard, OP scratched it, so OP's share is 100%", "Its silly. He was thrilled with $7k but its the principle of it i guess lol", "^(danger zone!!)", "We'd, I mean, they'd NEVER do \\*that\\*...", "\"Sandwich short of a picnic...\"", "Or you could just go for the classic; Wanker!", "\"their lift doesn't stop at the top floor anymore!\"", "A few fries short of a happy meal.", "Not the sharpest Christian in the Bible (thank you Easy A)."]}
