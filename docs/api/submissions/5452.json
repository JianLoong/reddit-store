It was probably one of the few times in her memory when someone didn't see the disability first and treat her differently for it. Her parents are allowed to be upset as protecting their child is their life, which any disability makes harder.  \nIt's sad that they felt they needed to part ways over this, but no one should feel bad for their roles.", "NTA. Adults said this to me all the time in the context of growing. Her parents are definitely oversensitive when even the kid gets the joke.", "As a parent, I would\u2019ve lost my crap on you IF my daughter was hurt or upset by the comment. But A) she\u2019s 5, and B) thought it was hilarious. They overreacted. NTA.", "What? That's hilarious and I don't see how it would be offensive even if it was intentional.\nNTA.", "NTA. A simple faux pas. I work with many disabled people, and this is exactly the sort of joke they would make and howl at. You have apologised.  I don't know what they want from you. Clearly it is a very sensitive issue for them and undoubtedly hard for them to deal with.  Perhaps give them time.  Hopefully they will come around.", "HAH. Omfg no. NTA. But wow that\u2019s funny. That kid is gonna grow up with a good sense of humour if she\u2019s already laughing about it like this.", ">We finally got together recently and I'm pretty sure the friendship is over because ***I put my foot in my mouth***.\n\nI was going to vote no until I reread that insensitive sentence and it flipped my vote to YTA.\n\nBased on how easily OP let that comment slip in, I\u2019m sensing this wasn\u2019t the first time he said something insensitive.\n\nedited grammatical error.", "I don't think he meant it as joke, which makes this even more unfortunate and WAY funnier", "He genuinely meant she got taller and that makes it funnier for me lol", "It wasn\u2019t even a joke. It was literally OP commenting on how much the child had grown since he last saw her. Shame on the parents for getting so twisted about it.", "I bought a house. At closing we found out the guy was going to school to be an undertaker. My stupid self goes \"wow, that's kind of a dying career.\" (meaning, lost art that not many get into....)\n\nMy husband didn't divorce me and they still sold me the house.", "Mom brain. It\u2019s real. You called the child the correct name, that\u2019s a win!\n\n Please stop beating yourself up over this! I\u2019m hoping your relatives will get over it and you just caught them at a sensitive or stressful day. \n\nI\u2019d send a card or flowers if you\u2019re really worried, but I\u2019m betting this will blow over in time.\n\nETA- I wonder if they\u2019re trying to keep her from making self deprecating comments about herself, it\u2019s something I myself had to watch when I noticed mine would put themselves down because they heard mom doing itto herself. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not so much your comment but their fears for her confidence and ability to fit in. You could address the underlying fear, whatever it is, in your apology.", "They're not doing their kid any favors. That was hilarious and a wonderful reaction.  The fact she howled with laughter says it all.  Sounds like you're good people to have around a kid with disabilities.  Sorry her parents can't see that.", "Another reason to switch to metric. NTA", "The double meaning is what makes it so funny.", "And I get that I do but this little girl is 5 so probably doesn\u2019t really understand yet but I can\u2019t imagine how many unwanted comments these parents have got since she was born. \nMy grandad was a thalidomide baby and was born with one hand and the amount of comments he got was atrocious and just because people said them out of either not understanding or putting there foot in the there mouth it wasn\u2019t really any different to those who said it to be nasty because eventually they all just blurred together and it was just one more person commenting on something he had absolutely no control over.", "A man bought our old couch and when I opened the door I noticed that he was missing an arm. He was wearing a shirt that said \u201cLMAO- laughed my arm off.\u201d That\u2019s the attitude that will make life better when you\u2019re dealing with a missing limb.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/HelloInternet/comments/czcf7u/canadian_measurement_flowchart/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"]}
