Currently I(31f) and Evan's girlfriend \"Cassie\" (30f) are both pregnant and due about a week apart. Cassie is having a little girl and we are having twin boys. Throughout the pregnancy (currently 30 weeks) we have tried to be very supportive.  (This is our second pregnancy so we know it can be really hard).  We have got them a crib. Picked up and delivered it for them. We went through our daughters clothes and gave them clothes, toys, and baby necessity. I text them about once a week to see how they are doing. Through all of this the only time they respond to us is of they want something (the crib, clothes, frozen meals for post delibery... ) I am very frustrated and my husband sees this. So he told his friend he needs to at least occasionally respond to our texts. His friend FLIPPED OUT that life is busy and he just doesnt have time. He is working full time and dealing with pregnancy and ..... I am furious. Both my husband and I work full time, dealing with a twin pregnancy,  have a toddler... yet we are putting in an effort to be supportive friends and help them and they can't bother to take rent seconds and even respond back to a text unless they need/want something. I have had enough and told my husband he can still be friends with Evan but I am done and I refuse to give/help him with any more baby stuff. So AITAH?

They are taking advantage of your kindness and only seeing you in terms of what they can get. No matter how stressful life gets, friends should be there for each other in equal amounts, otherwise it\u2019s not a healthy friendship. Congratulations on your new babes!", "NTA. You have a toddler and are pregnant while working and yall can take the time to text. It takes no time at all to text back or ask how someone is. They only seem to reach out when they want something. Now that they have a crib and clothes you no longer need to do anything else. I wouldn't go to the baby shower or do anything else. If you husband wants to still be his friend fine, but you should not be made to do so after doing all that you have and then had it thrown back in your face.", "NAH stop sending them texts. Friendship \nshouldn\u2019t be one sided. Are they helping or dropping of meals for you? Save your energy for your own children.", "I go with NAH I can understand your frustration and you have more on the plate then them yes, but do you remember your first pregnancy and struggles you had them saying you are used to pregnancy is probably overstating it but at least, for me our second pregnancy was an easier ride then the first(besides my wife had heavier morningsickness in the first trimester).\n\nYou just get a better routine and that might be what they struggle with,they aren't entitled to have you as free helper but maybe this viewpoint helps", "This is tough because while you and hubby are being very generous, it's entirely possible that you two are being overbearing based on your previous pregnancy experience and the support you wish you had. \n\nThey definitely could have been a little more clear with how involved they want you two or the space they need right now.\n\nI think you all likely have valid feelings here and you all need to back off each other, enjoy the last bit of your third trimester and come back together when babies are here and everyone is a bit more settled.\n\nNAH", "Thing is, when friends don't behave like friends, you get to put them on pause. NTA. Stop seeking them out. Let them figure out their own crap. And stop making ALL the effort. Make none. They'll notice. Trust me. They will either reciprocate or accept the distance. But, we have all had to teach people we care about how we expect to be treated. All you want is mutual consideration and respect. Those aren't hard to give.\n\nNTA. No way. One sided friendship is a huge chore. (Being pregnant doesn't actually make a person a PITA. They have to choose that for themselves, after all.)", "NTA. Your attitude is justified.

Not one person doing all the giving.", "NTA. That are users. How much support do they need? Just kiss this friendship good-bye.", "NAH.\n\nI think you and your husband are doing what you think is best to help support them during what is a stressful and draining time.  Did you offer up the items, or are they asking for them?  \n\nI would also feel a certain type of way if the only acknowledgement was regarding the actual items being given to them, so I do understand the feeling of frustration.  I just also could see the other party not feeling the need to respond to every \"check-in\" text without knowing the full context.  It could be draining on it's own right depending on the personalities.\n\nI'd still lean more to having you and your husband's back though.  Ultimately texts aren't very hard to respond to if you actually want to.  Anyone can make time for a quick reply, regardless of how hectic life is.  It's one of the most worn out fucking excuses adults make... we are all tired, stressed, busy etc.. a text doesn't take much.", "NTA take a step back.", "ESH \n\nYou are trying to be kind but everyone handles things differently, and what might seem manageable to you, may not be for them. It could be that you\u2019re being overbearing, or unintentionally inserting yourself into their already extremely stressful lives. \n\nHaving said that, it\u2019s rude for them to be asking things of you and accepting gifts without any kind of reciprocity. If a friend of mine was going above and beyond to support me I\u2019d be making the effort to be just as kind and supportive back.", "NAH. Everyone is stressed, everyone is tired, no one is on their best behavior. Delivery is weeks away and everyone is having a hard time. Everyone needs to just take a step back and realize what the problem is and that it will be resolved very soon, and it isnt worth losing a long time friendship over. Its fine to take a break but everyone will be better off if they can just knuckle down and get through this time. Good luck to you all.", "NTA. They are. And are using you. You did the right thing. Go LC with them. Don't make any more effort in being friends with them. This kind of stress can't be good for your pregnancy.", "ESH\n\nOn one hand they could show some appreciation, on the other hand expecting/demanding a response makes this seem a bit transactional.  \n\nThis is your second pregnancy, their first.  I don't know what their current situation is, financial, mental, family support, etc.  I don't think you know either.  You being able to handle your situation does mean they're able to at the moment.\n\nThey've also been friends for 20 years, and outside of this pregnancy has he shown similar behavior?  If not, maybe cut them some slack.", "NTA\n\nCut off this friendship. They are moochers.", "We all have a limit and you are at yours.  NTA", "NTA. Being busy is no excuse for bad manners.  If you go out of your way for them, the least they can do is log on and say thank you. Stop helping, let them do for themselves", "Nope , NTA... Give them space..  don't call/ text, anything unless they reach out to you...  & no more financial/ gift help", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
