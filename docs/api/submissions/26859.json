Throughout the pregnancy (currently 30 weeks) we have tried to be very supportive.  (This is our second pregnancy so we know it can be really hard).  We have got them a crib. Picked up and delivered it for them. We went through our daughters clothes and gave them clothes, toys, and baby necessity. I text them about once a week to see how they are doing. Through all of this the only time they respond to us is of they want something (the crib, clothes, frozen meals for post delibery... ) I am very frustrated and my husband sees this. So he told his friend he needs to at least occasionally respond to our texts. His friend FLIPPED OUT that life is busy and he just doesnt have time. He is working full time and dealing with pregnancy and ..... I am furious. Both my husband and I work full time, dealing with a twin pregnancy,  have a toddler... yet we are putting in an effort to be supportive friends and help them and they can't bother to take rent seconds and even respond back to a text unless they need/want something.

Now that they have a crib and clothes you no longer need to do anything else. I wouldn't go to the baby shower or do anything else.

Friendship \nshouldn\u2019t be one sided. Are they helping or dropping of meals for you? Save your energy for your own children.", "I go with NAH I can understand your frustration and you have more on the plate then them yes, but do you remember your first pregnancy and struggles you had them saying you are used to pregnancy is probably overstating it but at least, for me our second pregnancy was an easier ride then the first(besides my wife had heavier morningsickness in the first trimester).\n\nYou just get a better routine and that might be what they struggle with,they aren't entitled to have you as free helper but maybe this viewpoint helps", "This is tough because while you and hubby are being very generous, it's entirely possible that you two are being overbearing based on your previous pregnancy experience and the support you wish you had. \n\nThey definitely could have been a little more clear with how involved they want you two or the space they need right now.\n\nI think you all likely have valid feelings here and you all need to back off each other, enjoy the last bit of your third trimester and come back together when babies are here and everyone is a bit more settled.\n\nNAH", "Thing is, when friends don't behave like friends, you get to put them on pause. NTA. Stop seeking them out. Let them figure out their own crap. And stop making ALL the effort. Make none. They'll notice. Trust me. They will either reciprocate or accept the distance. But, we have all had to teach people we care about how we expect to be treated. All you want is mutual consideration and respect. Those aren't hard to give.\n\nNTA. No way.

Did you offer up the items, or are they asking for them?  \n\nI would also feel a certain type of way if the only acknowledgement was regarding the actual items being given to them, so I do understand the feeling of frustration.

It could be draining on it's own right depending on the personalities.\n\nI'd still lean more to having you and your husband's back though.  Ultimately texts aren't very hard to respond to if you actually want to.  Anyone can make time for a quick reply, regardless of how hectic life is.

If a friend of mine was going above and beyond to support me I\u2019d be making the effort to be just as kind and supportive back.", "NAH. Everyone is stressed, everyone is tired, no one is on their best behavior. Delivery is weeks away and everyone is having a hard time. Everyone needs to just take a step back and realize what the problem is and that it will be resolved very soon, and it isnt worth losing a long time friendship over. Its fine to take a break but everyone will be better off if they can just knuckle down and get through this time. Good luck to you all.", "NTA. They are. And are using you. You did the right thing.

I don't know what their current situation is, financial, mental, family support, etc.  I don't think you know either.  You being able to handle your situation does mean they're able to at the moment.\n\nThey've also been friends for 20 years, and outside of this pregnancy has he shown similar behavior?

They might have other support structures, and god knows what going on that isn't your business, and it's their right to not have it be your business.\n\nI know it's not your intention but you easily can come across as patronizing and annoying and even harassing with the behavior you described.", "No if it seemed like I wanted to imply that,sorry for  the clumsy writing as it's my secondary language.\n\nYou are better prepared as most are because you know the struggles from experience,you have more at your hands but also better tools to handle it then a \"firsttimer\".\n\nTake some distance take a breather from them and reevaluate the whole situation,they most likely struggle with the hiccups we all had when getting confronted by this major change in lifestyle,even if it seems frustrating to you while you juggle even more.\n\nAnyway best wishes to you and your growing  family", "I would nix the post-delivery dinners too at this point, after all it will be post-delivery (or close!) for you too and you'll have more to recover from!", "Well then I'd probably lean more that you're NTA.  It's a bad look when someone is always open to take what you have to give (in any capacity, emotionally, physical gifts etc) but then ghost when it's anything else.\n\nRelationships are complicated though, and if your husband and Evan are lifetime friends and he still flipped his lid... maybe there's more going on behind the scenes in their life than you're aware of.", "They ASKED FOR a whole fucking crib and YOU OFFERED MORE???

That being said, never responding at all except when they want something is more than a little ungracious. I think it's good that your husband stuck up for you and approached them about it. Their response was unfortunate and clearly over the top.\n\nI'm sorry it's not working out. Maybe they'll come around once they settle into life with their newborn and apologize. In the meantime, it sounds like it's best to keep contact to a minimum and not offer any more help.", "NAH.

No one ever has to respond to your texts.  If you don't feel the friendship is reciprocal, then just quit contacting them and quit responding.  You have been through pregnancy before.
