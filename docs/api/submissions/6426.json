We both make money, but I make much more than him, so although we never explicitly talked about it, I knew that I was going to be the one financially in charge in our relationship, and from the beginning I was fine with it. So for the past years I have taken care of most of our expenses, including rent.\n\nA few months ago my partner decided that he wanted his daughter (18F) from a past relationship to come to live with us, so that he can spend more time with her. If I\u2019m being honest I wasn\u2019t so happy about this decision, but I accepted it and I supported my partner because I understand that this is important for him.\n\nThe problem is that he was supposed to be in complete charge of all of his daughters expenses, but since he doesn\u2019t make much money he is always asking me to lend him money, but he never pays me back. I have been feeling very uncomfortable with this situation because I don\u2019t want to be financially responsible for another person right now, but I haven\u2019t said anything because I don\u2019t know how to address this situation with my partner and because I feel like I\u2019m being selfish.\n\nNow, recently my partner has been giving signs that he wants his other child (16M) to come live with us as well. And I definitely don\u2019t want this to happen because I already know that I will also have to pay for his stuff.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m being really selfish, so I can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d anytime he asks me for money for his kids, but I don\u2019t want to help financially in any way, I want him to be the only one in charge of his kids expenses, but that also means that his kids will have to limit themselves to many things due to lack of money. And deep down I know that if I don't help he wont be able to take good care of his kids.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672793121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102ozql/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_partner_with_his/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are his kids, not yours. It is completely unreasonable to expect you to support them on top of you already footing most of the bills. I would make this my hill to die on. Protecting yourself from being taken advantage of is not being selfish.", "NTA for how you feel but you will be the AH if you don\u2019t address this immediately.\n\nYou must sit your partner down and explain to him that HIS children are HIS financial responsibility and you don\u2019t want to carry this burden and that he can\u2019t expect it of you. The longer you delay having this conversation, the worse this situation will become. \n\nHe has NO right to expect this of you no matter how much you make. These are his children. You\u2019re not responsible for providing for them.", "NTA but when he officially asks for the other child to move in is the perfect opportunity for you to open up the conversation.\n\nAsk him what his plan is to financially support both children, if he doesn\u2019t have one in the moment tell him you won\u2019t consider it until he has an in depth plan with on how he\u2019s going to support both of his kids. Let him know that you\u2019ve been the one mainly financially supporting his daughter even though he said he was going to do it and you are not in a place where you can continue to financially support both (nor should it be your responsibility to). Let him know that you want to see him step up and take care of his kids or at least have his daughter contribute if she is capable of getting some kind of job because you aren\u2019t going to do it anymore.\n\nHe is taking advantage of you and it\u2019s not okay. \n\nUnless either of his children are risking homelessness by not living with him this is not your responsibility and you need to make that clear. He can still be an involved dad without having the kids live with you. Encourage him to set aside some time every month to spend a day off with each kid, invite them over for dinner 1-2x a week.", "NTA. Unfortunately you\u2019re just going to have to talk about it, because it\u2019s not the terms you agreed to. Problems in relationships don\u2019t go away by not talking about them, and if you don\u2019t say something now his other kid is going to turn into another financial responsibility you never asked for. If he reacts poorly, maybe it\u2019s time for you to step back and take a look at the bigger long term picture", ">And deep down I know that if I don't help he wont be able to take good care of his kids.\n\nAs long as you can feed, clothe and put a roof over a child's head, you are taking care of that child.  Buying them everything they want is spoiling them.  You need to talk to your partner and explain that you're not comfortable with the children moving in and you will not be the one who is financially responsible for them.  NTA.", "You need to stop feeling bad about it. These are not your kids so not your financial responsibility. Your partner knew before he invited them in that he could not and still can't afford to financially take care of 2 other people( he's not even paying for his own rent), so inviting a second one in sounds like HE is comfortable letting you foot the bill.\n\nIf you don't like this arrangement,  be vocal about it and stop giving him money. If you don't stop giving, he will not stop asking or expecting money from you. You should not be his ATM if you don't want to.\n\nNtA. \n\nBut be prepared for a fight, nasty names and him calling you selfish and heartless. He will fight with you to get your money.", "You two need to talk. I think you should take some time and really think if you want to be with someone who has kids.", "NTA.  Your partner is using you to play daddy dearest.  Wake up and draw the line!", "**He is manipulating you into supporting his kids financially.** His tactics have already worked with one child. They will work with the second child unless you **learn to say no.**\n\nSay no. Say no. Say no.\n\nNTA.", "NTA as you are already paying most of the expenses like rent. Best advice is to have a good long talk with him about financial expectations and if necessary, every time he asks for a loan, make him sign a document with a payment plan.", "His children are not your responsibility, and it sounds like he's mooching off of you. Beware. **NTA**", "NTA. Use the discussion about the son moving in to talk about the financial issues in general.  That is, \"I have concerns about your son moving in because I feel I will end up paying the bill,\" and when your partner undoubtedly says \"No, I'll take care of everything, I promise,\" you say \"That's what you said about your daughter and yet I'm constantly giving you money to cover her expenses. Do you have an actual financial plan to cover both of them, or are you just hoping it will somehow work out?\" Keep the focus on HIM and his obligations as a father, NOT about you somehow denying a better life for the kids.", "INFO. Can the kids find part time jobs?\n\nWhat expenses do you mean?  Food, or extras?  \n\nThe kids need to work for extras and I feel your pain for the other but it\u2019s better than the kids not being fed.", "Yeah you gotta talk to your husband. That\u2019s just a no brainer. If you\u2019re not saying anything then you\u2019re giving him money when he asks and just quietly getting mad about it, that\u2019s a recipe for a really stupid disaster that will end up blowing up in front of the kids - and they didn\u2019t do anything.", "NTA but you definitely need to address it and ASAP! Need to explain your feelings and that he needs to figure out how to support his children on his own as you have enough of your own financial responsibility. You can\u2019t keep lending money to him that you never get back. Talk about it politely but firmly. \n\nInfo: what\u2019s the former/current home situation for these children?", "NTA \\~ Assuming the best intentions all around, your partner is not a mind reader. I urge you to tell them how you feel. In relationships, you don\u2019t want to harbor resentment.", "NTA you aren\u2019t responsible for his children and you should probably leave this situation now before he brings home that 16 year old. I think if you end up financially covering his children you will end up resenting him or them. I\u2019m also concerned this is so important to him right now because he\u2019s comfortable with you supporting him and his bills and most importantly the financials for his children. You don\u2019t need to feel bad about his poor decisions.", "NTA.  His indifference to his indebtedness and willingness to incur more, to your detriment, is telling.  It seems like separate households with separate finances would be best.  Otherwise he is going to ride that gravy train for all its worth.", "NTA. But you're going to have to do the difficult thing and have the difficult conversation. Any time there is a dramatic financial shift in a household you have to sit down, talk it out, draw up a new budget and then stick to it. Which means allotting a certain amount of monies for him to tap to help his children. He will have to learn how to make that amount enough", "NTA - But if you can't have a hard/truthful conversation with him NOW, then resentment will build and eventually you'll feel he's been planning this all along to slowly take advantage of you.   He has already tested the waters with the first kid - you've paid up without complaint, so now he wants to add another.  You have to stop it, because he won't. \n\nYou need to tell him that you know it's important to him and you've tried to be emotionally supportive; but his financial needs for them are taking a toll and you have to put an end to it before you resent him for it.  If you live together, then either he needs to move out to a place where the kids can be with him or figure out on his own how to provide for the kids without you contributing.  Remind him you never signed up to support his kids...period.", "NTA\n\nyou need to have a serious talk now.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair of him to expect you to pay for his children if you two agreed his first kid could live there on the condition he\u2019d take care of them financially. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that he wants to spend more time with them, but not at your financial expense. (Unless you were fine with it, but you\u2019re clearly not since you\u2019re here asking).\n\nYou\u2019re not being selfish here. They\u2019re not your kids. You\u2019ve said the kids both have stable moms they live with. So it\u2019s not a situation where if you don\u2019t take them in, they\u2019d be on the streets.\n\nYou just need to be honest with him. Your job is not to financially support his kids.", "NTA. His kids, his responsibility. It's very callous of him to do this, specially knowing how you feel about the whole situation.", "NTA, however you never should\u2019ve agreed to let the first kid move in knowing that you have a problem with it since he can\u2019t afford it.  And now he\u2019s asking about the 2nd kid and he thinks you\u2019re ok with it because you said yes to the first and probably thinks he and his children are a package deal.  Lastly ask yourself if you\u2019d expect the same if the roles were reversed?  That will help you make a decision.", "Find yourself a nice little place, just for you that he can pop over and visit you and leave him to look after his kids and all the expenses involved. He already knows he can freeload off of you, borrow money to never repay and move his kids into your home without even making sure that you were okay with it. Now he wants to add another child into the mix, when will it stop?", "NTA \n\nHowever, you need to discuss this with your partner. How you are feeling and your expectations. You agreed to cover expenses for the 2 of you, but his kids are above what you are willing to do. You don\u2019t want to be the ATM for him and his kids.", "ESH\nTalk about it with him. You're adults in an adult relationship, you need to be having talks about money regularly especially when you are living together. You can't expect him to know your boundaries if you aren't vocalizing them.", "Now I understand why ppl cheat in a relationship. You\u2019re not getting any of your needs (security, affirmation) met. \n\nAsk urself what would you do if you were a man?\n\nSaid no and split, if you felt used.\n\nThe feelings you\u2019re having aren\u2019t going to go away!", "ESH.  What were you thinking?  He couldn\u2019t cover his expenses before, but, magically you think he will be able to cover his kids expenses too?   You need to sit down with him and have the budget come to Jesus meeting.  Go thru each line item with him.  Include funds coming in, and how they are going out.  As a couple, problem solve this, because you taking care of finances has allowed him to stick his head in the sand like an ostrich.", "NTA\n\nHowever, those children didn't do anything to you, and I'm assuming they have an unstable situation at home, so it would be best if you shared a little bit with your husband. I'm assuming money isn't tight.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
