And there is also no \"high road\" when you force your child to be around people who think there's something wrong with them or their parents--that's actually an AH move there. Why are you tolerating this hate and racism?

Your baby will be mexican and she will not stop her comments just because it\u2019s half your husbands DNA.

His mother will be racist to your child and your kid should never have to be exposed to that.", "My baby was 8 weeks early and was in the NICU for 38 days. Visitors were allowed and were allowed to hold the baby.

As a preterm mum I know how hard it is. Stay strong and enjoy your little miracle. Oh, and NTA in any way at all. Glad you and your husband have cut her off, she is completely out of line.", "I don't see any reason why that idiot should be allowed any where near your family.  Both your immediate family  and the one you're building with hubby.\n\nAlso, congrats on the little one", "Lol, while I appreciate your sentiments, you posted your life on a public forum so I will share my observations.

FAFO.", "NTA. I'd tell her you sent the baby to Mexico to make her more comfortable.", "NTA - my MIL insisted on waiting outside the room with my FIL and two teenage stepsons the entire time I was in labor so that she could immediately see the baby. At one point she walked right in while I was on my hands and knees, butt hanging out and having a huge contraction. I was more a little PO'ed. Then even after that she kept wandering into the room whenever she felt like it until it was time to push and the nurses wouldn't let anyone in. I just wanted a few minutes with my husband and baby alone, as well as a bit of time to recover from pushing that kid out before having anyone else there wanting to hold the child I spent 9 miserable months growing. \nThe birth of a child is your moment, even more than your wedding day. It's emotional, exhausting and the first time you will meet one of the most important people in your life. That is YOUR time so it doesn't matter why you do or don't want someone there (but you are more than justified in why you didn't want her there), it's your choice. Period. \nFor the record, I knew I was going to be induced for my second child but I didn't tell anyone and told the hospital that they weren't allowed to tell anyone I was there if they called so that I had total control of who met the baby and when. I upset some people but I don't regret it for a second because I was able to have the time I wanted and needed with the people I wanted to share those moments with before introducing my baby to anyone else.", "Nta. Im spiteful. I would have asked how she expects to see the baby if ya'll go back to Mexico (then let her think you all are moving to get away from her).

Bonus points if you learn to insult her in it. \n\nAlso \"go back to Mexico\" should always be responded to with \"go back to Europe.\" Turnabout is fair play! \n\nThe non-nuclear option is, don't let her near the baby without a written apology in which she specifically articulates 1) what she did wrong 2) why it was wrong 3) what she will do to make amends and 4) how she will behave differently in future.

I'll take the bait today. I work in health care. My MIL is a retired L&D nurse of 30 plus years. I don't doubt *your* story is true. Your baby was also not nearly as preterm. I'm sure you also didn't sit around the dinner table talking about who was going to be in the delivery room to deliver your preemie because it's not allowed especially not now during immediate post COVID. You don't sit around talking about a premature delivery period because premature labor is a life threatening emergency that happens suddenly and unexpectedly. \n\nIf OP got pregnant on the very *first* of this year, she would not be due until *late* September. Minimum. Again, this is assuming she got pregnant on the very first of this year and realized she was pregnant mid to late January. \n\nIf her usage of English is just as shitty as this story, and what she means is she *realized* she was pregnant at the beginning of this year, she admits she was trying. This means she would have been checking frequently and would have concieved early to mid December. Even if she means she *realized* she was pregnant at the very beginning of this year and not concieved, again, that's why I'm saying that baby is 10 weeks premature *minimum.* In reality, it's even more than that. Much more.\n\nI'm tired and I'm old. I do not feel like giving a further bullet point breakdown of why OP's story is horseshit, but for those of us who actually do this line of work, it's obvious that this story is horseshit.\n\nI realize that 90-95% of posts on this site are creative writing exercises. It's still irritating when a story is *so* obviously a creative exercise and rage bait, especially when it deals with a field you have knowlege and education in and are passionate about. If you're gonna fake your shit, at least put some thought and care into this. \n\nI read my MIL this story and she snorted and laughed at how absurdly fake it is. Nobody would give a rats ass about thier racist MIL when thier baby is on deaths door step and they sure as shit wouldn't casually sit around a table deciding who gets to witness the birth of a baby that has a high probability of dying when they wouldn't even be allowed in the room in the first place *and* they certainly wouldn't have *time* to do that even if they had the emotional intelligence of a brick and wanted to do that. \n\nAnd then wondering if they are the asshole about thier stupid MIL drama when they've got a baby dancing with death in the hospital. Nobody would give a fuck about anybody or anything except that baby unless they are obtuse or a monster. They certainly wouldn't be posting here.\n\nThe tone of the post and the comments of OP are off, the facts are off, the entire fucking post is off.\n\nI could rant and rave further on this but I'm just done. Reddit doesn't care about facts or truth or even just basic science. We just wanna yell about made up racist MIL's because it feels good to be on the correct side of today's outrage bait and wave our little justice pitchforks around.\n\nIt's fake, it's BS and OP needs to work on thier science knowledge and writing skills before they attempt another BS post because they are bored and have nothing better to do with thier time.", "It is certainly an ethnicity.
