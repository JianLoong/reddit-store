After all, your child will have that \"Mexican blood\" as well and comments like that can severely screw up people/young children.", "Mil is a racist biatch.", "NTA.

From the moment she refused to shake your parents\u2019 hands, your husband should have drawn the line.\n\nShe needs to formally apologize to you & your family and behave like a decent person.

If you were having a kidney stone and not a baby would she want to be in the delivery room? Probably not.", "NTA for your decision. Stick to your guns about that. Your mom is supportive of you and you'll need that during delivery and postpartum.\n\nYou definitely could have handled the announcement part with more tact. It isn't so much that your racist MIL deserves tact. She will take more than a clue by four to rethink her attitude. Ideally, the message should have come in private from her son, not from you. \n\nIf you give her justifiable grounds to be offended, she'll get as much leverage out of that as she can.

Congratulations.

Giving birth is real intimate/stressful/tiring as you know now. Why would/should you allow someone who has not been supportive of your family let alone the baby being conceived. At the end of the day you need to be in a warm and comfortable place filled with support while you give birth and overall your decision on what feels right to you. You followed your instinct and I feel you made a good decision. Maybe she\u2019ll learn from this and stop being the way she is. Anyways, congratulations on the new addition to your family. Hope the best to you and yours.", "NTA. Why on earth would you want a racist jackass present when you're at your most vulnerable? The last thing you need is her pre-gaming the celebratory champagne and being buzzed enough to make more hateful remarks when your child is born.\n\nNow is the time to make sure your husband is on the same page. MIL is on her very last chance. If she ever again makes a disparaging/racist/bigoted comment about your, your parents', or *your child's* Mexican heritage, she's out of your child's life. Your kid deserves better than a life of being subtly cut down by Racist Grandma.", "Would you allow a stranger who acted like that around your child?

You do not need to justify who you do and don't want there.   The only people with a \\*right\\* to be there are you, the doctor, and any nurses required.

Not deliberately exposing the baby to racism is your obligation as a parent.

She didn't seem to care at all about the baby, judging from what you said she did, but now she's demanding that she sees the baby as soon as possible? Is she serious? Giving birth is already stressful enough, don't feel guilty at all.", "NTA - you hold your boundaries.

Will she hate your child if they look ethnically Mexican? Try to whiten them up somehow?

This country is a land of immigrants and her being uncomfortable doesn\u2019t change that.
