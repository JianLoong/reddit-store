I don't like knowing I'm being used by ppl who said they wished I was their son.\n\nMy senior also thought that though I acted immaturely, this could count as harassment from her husband as her husband contacted me, an apprentice instead of going to her, our senior coordinator. She highly suspects that he did this ON BEHALF of my friend, as she's not one to hide behind her man. (Thinking about it too, he contacted me at midnight on a Friday. Looking back on these texts, he was probably drunk and I was too emotional to see it at the time). We're going to do a meeting with the coordinator on Monday and try to correct this situation.
