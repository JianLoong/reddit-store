I know I'm by no means huge, but I am clumsy and lumbering, so I can understand if she was more startled then intended. I guess what's normal to you and me isn't as universal as I thought haha.

So I crossed a boundary I didn't see. I was just happy to see her and I wanted to get her attention since she didn'tnotice me as she passed by. It doesn't help that her husband was using an angle grinder, so if I talked in my normal voice she wouldn't hear me, so I thought (in my stupidity) if I had to raise my voice anyways, let's do it playfully. Thus leading to the \"boo\" in question.", "It really doesn\u2019t matter what you think- I don\u2019t mean offense here, far from it. There\u2019s all sorts of weird triggers that bring people back. The associations our brains make between things is remarkably hard to predict and frequently don\u2019t make sense to others.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what it is, or even if that\u2019s what happened, It could just be as simple as she really doesn\u2019t like being scared.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything mean on purpose, but startling people triggers some of the most primal parts of our brain. And that part is dominated purely by a need to survive. For some, it\u2019s a source of adrenaline and fun. For others,  it\u2019s pure terror and dread. \n\nThis is also why the guy reacted the way he did, the startle response is extremely powerful\u2026 and his brain learned to deal with and control the sudden fear with anger and violence. It\u2019s pure instinct- and while his response was *extreme*\u2026 that loss of control is unsettling to many.", "An over active startle response is a pretty common PTSD symptom. I have PTSD and I would have jumped out of my chair.\n\nYou were trying to startle her. That's the actual point of yelling \"boo!\" at someone. But for some people a startle equates to eminent danger. \n\nYou should just be thankful you haven't gone through anything that would give you the empathy to understand that. In that moment she felt in danger, at her place of work.\n\nThe husband contacted you to tell you not to do it again because now she *doesn't feel safe at work* and she was worrying that it would keep happening. If she wasn't afraid that it would keep happening why would her husband have done that? You made an old lady feel scared to go to work.\n\nYou owe her an apology.

My grandkids love creeping in saying boo..", "My mum has been paraplegic since she was 40 and I was 16. Throughout my 20s, my mum, her carers and I had a game of scaring each other. I use to hide under my mum's bed, my mum had one of them hide under her covers at night so when I went to check on her just after they were meant to have left, the jumped out at me and it has even gone as far as hiding in bushes in the garden. It was alot of fun for all of us and it all depends on the people. I had them all at my wedding 10 years ago and though most of them don't work for my mum any more, I am still close to most of them.", "I would try to speak to her again and apologize. You misread the situation, you learn from it and will not do it again.\nTell her that you had no intention in disrespecting her, and that it is actually the opposite.

It's just not good to equate apples to oranges.\n\nYou are not taking that poor man's situation as seriously as it should be taken. I agree with you, I was out of line and I will repent to her on Monday for scaring her. That being said, A prank is not a felony offense like breaking and entering and you seem to be taking his reality really lightly by not seeing that.

My own therapist was bawling her eyes out while she wrote my own PTSD diagnosis while I sat uncomfortably after all my life experiences wore her down. \n\nI've never had a startle response as a PTSD trigger so yes, I'm ignorant to a hyper startle response but you are not the only type of PTSD out there and it definitely stings when people decide their pain means mine doesn't exist.", "Well, the shop is sectioned off. It's a weird set up. There's a women's center and men's center divided by a tarp while we get it renovated. I would never play around near power tools. We're just a poor community center so everyone in the building gets to hear it lmao", "I am not taking something that happened a decade ago lightly. I didn\u2019t then and I don\u2019t now. \n\n\nAnd the B&E is irrelevant to this situation. What matters is that his startle response was triggered and so was hers, that\u2019s the similarity. Its unconscious. It wasn\u2019t something he could control. And it wasn\u2019t something she could control either. She was in \u201cfight, flight or freeze\u201d mode, at least for a moment. My friend was heavily weight to fight. Looks like she\u2019s weighted to freeze (like most people.)\n\nThat same loss of control happened to your coworker. It\u2019s an instinctual response that most animals (even animals without a brain,) have. Her response wasn\u2019t conditioned the same as his, but it was still triggered. \n\nWhich is why it\u2019s a mildly assholish move to scare people casually. I get if you both come around a corner, or something. But you saw it coming and chose to scare her. \n\nshe\u2019s an old lady, and probably won\u2019t have the same repose. But that fear lingered. Which is probably why she played along- in her position, she couldn\u2019t have fought you off. Playing along long enough to gtfo is a common tactic in a world where men attack women for simple rejection. \n\nAnd i should also probably clarify that the reason you want to keep your distance for a while is to protect your job. If it comes down to them or you- and it probably will- HR will take the course that\u2019s best for the company.\n\n\n(And just to clarify, the charge if they had pressed charges would have been a petty misdemeanor the only law he was breaking was low-level trespass. The friends reaction would have been a shoe-in for self defense. The entire thing was caused by a bunch of idiots too immature to respect boundaries. No felonies were ever committed.)", "My friend made a passing boo at her mum, she got startled and fell down and hit her head. It wasn't bad in the end but could have ended way worse.\n\nYou don't know how people react to it and that should be the indicator that it might be a bad idea to do it.\n\nEdit: past trauma isn't the only reason it's a bad idea. You never know how healthy the heart of the people you scare are.", "About 12 years ago a teenage boy jumped out in front of me on the pavement waving his arms and making woo sounds. I had a brief panic attack, screamed  and leapt away. He was very surprised and apologised profusely.  The reality is that two weeks previously I had been physically attacked in the street by a man high on drugs who tried to strangle me. \n\nLots of people have anxiety, ptsd and panic attacks. You don't know what issues someone else may be dealing with.  You should never assume its going to be a joke for them just because it's a joke for you.\n\nYTA", "Imagine if her husband heard her scream in fright and it caused him to hurt himself on his work? Please consider others around you in your actions.", "And in the future I will. I would never intentionally harm him or his wife.\n\nBut I garuntee he wouldn't have heard it. It's 1stly in  different area of the center so we get the beautiful construction sounds and they hear nothing and \n\n2ndly there's noise all the time. It's a community center. There's children screaming, people fighting with their ex's, people laughing and people playing music and teenage boys hammering away at sheet metal while playing death metal music in the men's section while we're open. That's why he had to confront he AFTER they both left. He didn't hear any of it."]}
