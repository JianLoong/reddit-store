My dad was rocked by the loss of mom and my mom's family were a great comfort to him during that time. They were also very good to me. He always made sure they had a solid place in my life.

I always kind of picked up on it but as I have grown older I can see where it all comes from. She is jealous that she's not my only mom, that my mom is still important to me and that I have family that connect me to a person I love and respect as much as my living parents despite never having known her.

My dad was so happy and he took some photos of me wearing it. But I remember my stepmom looking so close to tears that whole day after the present was given. When my dad commented after that I looked so much like my mom in her first photo with it, I noticed she had a reaction.\n\nI have tried to reassure her and I have continued to love her throughout this.\n\nNow I'm getting married and this is where I wonder about how I'm dealing with this. I always wear my mom's necklace now and plan to for my wedding. My dad gave my fiance my mom's ring to propose with. He also gave me a small flower pin she wore to her wedding. I asked my stepmom if I could have some stuff of her's to wear and she was so excited and eager, until she learned that I was also going to wear stuff representing my mom. She told me she didn't think it was fair to wear stuff from both of us. Then she asked me why she wasn't enough and what had she done wrong. I told her I wanted to represent both my mom's.

You'll be making the Mother of the Bride speech, sitting in the MoB chair. You'll be *there*. But the person who died so I could exist is still important to me, and she *won't* be there. So yeah, I'll be wearing her stuff. It's not a \"first place/second place\" thing to me, I love you both. People can love two sisters, I love my two moms. She was my first mom, you're my last mom. \n\nAnd if that doesn't work, then *she* doesn't love *you* enough to take the role she's being offered in your wedding, so maybe it's time to reconsider that offer. \n\nYou're definitely NTA.", "NTA your mom should seek therapy, because it\u2018s her problem feeling second best, not you wanting to honour both your mothers on your big day", "Oh man. This sucks. \n\nI very much assumed when I started reading that this was an ex situation. \n\n I'm delighted to hear that your dad kept your mom's family in your life. It's a wonderful connection to have. \n\nI feel some sympathy for your step mom. I think it's very common to compete with a dead person and it's impossible to win. My sympathy ends there though. It's so common that therapy could sort it right out. You love your Stepmom. It's clear. She should have taken the time when you were young to work through her feelings, not stomp them down. \n\nI don't believe you ever pitted them against each other. You love both. And it's wonderful. So many people barely get to love one mom. NTA and I hope your sm can figure this out.", "NTA - it sounds like stepmom cares, but she\u2019s really holding onto some idea - I don\u2019t know what - that makes her somehow not good enough. I think she ought to go sort that out in counseling. Maybe encourage her to go along with you or something.", "NTA. You have a lot on you emotionally, and you are doing a fantastic job of ensuring the important people in your life are represented on this important day. Your mother did not leave you voluntarily and certainly would have wanted to be there for your wedding. For as long as you can remember, your stepmom has always filled the role of a mother, but she needs to understand you have feelings for your biological mother.\n\nIt's unfair to everyone, you, your father, and your mother's family, to pretend your mother never existed and wasn't important to appease your stepmother. Your stepmother will presumably be sitting in the front row and will take on all the duties of the mother of the bride. There will probably be pictures of her helping you get ready. While I understand your stepmother does not want to share the woman she considers her daughter on her wedding day, she also needs to realize that wearing a few pieces of jewelry in memory of a special woman does not take away from your relationship or the importance she has played in your life.\n\nYour stepmother has got to stop seeing your love for your mother as competition for your feelings for her.", "NTA, at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour stepmom just has her own issues. If she insists on being upset at you being completely reasonable and reassuring, that is entirely her issue.

But she needs therapy for that, you\u2019ve done nothing to cause those feelings", "NTA. Stepmom is jealous of a dead person and wants to live in an alternate reality in which your birth mother doesn't exist, which is absurd.", "NTA. Your wedding day is not about her. If you want to wear something in remembrance if your mom, the woman who birthed you (and unfortunately died doing so), that is what you should do. I wore something of my mom\u2019s on my wedding day & also something of my grandmother\u2019s. Did that take anything away from my mom? No it did not. It just added to the sentiment of the love of my family. My cousin walked part way down the aisle with her dad & then was joined by her stepdad. If *added* something, it didn\u2019t take anything away.\n\nWeddings are about the couple & family, and you (you & your stepmom) wouldn\u2019t be a family if it weren\u2019t for your biological mom.

Your birth mother will forever be a symbol of love and your strong bond to her side if the family reassures you that she was a good person. Your stepmom is the woman who has raised you and help build the woman you are today and that love cannot be compared. She will be the one to see all the milestones, go wedding dress shopping, go nuts when you make her a grandparent etc. She will forever get to see and do things your birth mother never got and thats ok. You heart is big enough for the both of them. \n\nTell her you want something of her as well as your birth mother as she deserves equal recognition as you have equal love for both.", "NTA. I agre with others, stepmom should have sought out therapy from day 1.

I cannot really call either of you an AH, though your stepmom is veering close. \n\nI\u2019m going to go with NAH - only because I want to take a page out of your book and afford your stepmom some grace. But she needs to get over her jealousy. \n\nShe\u2019s not mom number 2. There\u2019s no numbers here. You nailed it when you said you were lucky to have two moms. One doesn\u2019t have to disappear for the other to be important.", "NTA: If anything, she should be honoring the woman who gave life to her daughter, who undoubtedly would have absolutely raised her herself if she could have.\n\nYour mother essentially provided SM with everything she ever wanted. To hold resentment toward her is absurd and SMs issue alone to confront in therapy. \n\nHer lack of objectivity about this and the fact she\u2019s guilting you about your wedding tells me she\u2019s held this resentment for decades and it\u2019s very likely shown up before now. If you\u2019re not in therapy, I suggest you explore it. \n\nThe fact you\u2019re questioning whether or not YTA is telling of the eggshells she\u2019s likely forced others to walk historically. Even if it was subtle, and you may not have noticed it at the time, it causes damage. \n\nINFO: Where is Dad on this? Has he had a frank discussion w/SM re: your wedding being off limits for her jealousy of your deceased mother? It\u2019s time to pull him in if not, I\u2019d be beside myself if this happened to my child.", "NTA. \n\n\"Could have given her this one day\" - no. It's your wedding. It is your day.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you have ever treated your step-mother as second best. You see her as your mother - she raised you. You also see your biological mother as your mother - she birthed you and intended to raise you. You are loved by both and you have love for both. Wanting to wear something that represents two of the most important women to you on your wedding day is beautiful. It is not a competition.", "Nta. She needs to talk to a professional, she's jealous of a dead woman and that's very sad.", "I find it interesting that other than the birthday incident this has never been a problem before now apparently?", "NTA-Her continued jealousy of your first mother is not yours to manage.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your step mom has issues that are her problem to deal with.  \n\nFrom what you write, you've never slighted her. Nor have you diminished her real contribution to your growing up. What you've done is expanded the definition of a \"real\" mom to include two people: the one who gave life to you and the one who raised you.  That's as it should be.", "NTA- she needs to learn how to deal with her feelings of jealousy of a person who is not around anymore. This is totally on her. You want her to be a part of her day and she is choosing to deal with it in a very immature way. You call her mom, you treat her as your mom, and she is the mom that is physically there to see you get married.

I said some distance.\n\nMy mother is my one and only mother but she, just like OP's stepmother, had an idea of the relationship she wanted to have with me, but that wasn't what I wanted. I wanted a mother, not for her to be my BFF. It is a lot to deal with because you always feel like you're disappointing them and that you're doing something wrong. There's always some type of emotional blackmail when she doesn't get her way and it's exhausting to deal with.", "Yeah I feel like most blended families need therapy of some sort. She was put in a complex situation when she married your dad that required nuance and skills that most people don\u2019t have to deal with.", "But I mean if they haven\u2019t had previous relationship problems", "NTA She needs to first understand that it was never a race or competition. You love your mom and you love your stepmom. You don't compare them. It is just whatbit is. Two moms. Instead of focusing so much on being number 1 she should focus on just being your mom and nothing else. There are no number it shouldn't be any. She raised you and by that she is your morher. Bunch of parents adopts children and they love them just the same as they would a baby with their dna. Connection you have is all you need. And your heart is big enough to have them both inside.", "NTA\n\nShe gets to see you and got to raise you...she is def the luckiest of the 2 of them.\n\nYour step mum needs counselling...it really sounds like you are close and bonded to each other. This is all her and some time in counselling will help her see that.", "NTA\n\nI also feel sorry for your stepmom. Feeling like you're in constant competition with a dead person cannot be good for you and of course it's a battle you cannot win. She really needs to get professional help. There's nothing you can do about the way she's feeling and it puts unfair expectations on you. You shouldn't have to choose. It's great that you're surrounded by so much love and that you get to have something that represents your biological mom. I hope the mom who raised you can come round to see that the love for your biological mother does not minimize the love you have for her.", "NTA. You sound like you have a good dad, how does he put up with this woman? You should not have to reassure her. Her feelings are toxic and disgusting.", "Nta and let her know she's the only one who thinks that and if she doesn't want to share fine but that won't change what you're going to wear.", "NTA. Your live mom has some issues she needs to deal with, but that's really not your problem. I hope you have peace and love and light in your life, and that your live mom does too.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't her day to have.", "1. OP said that was when she, aged 13, really first noticed it and how bad it was - not that it hadn\u2019t happened since. ETA: it may have happened pre age 13 too but OP was too young to appreciate what she was seeing. There\u2019s a word limit so I find it interesting you seem to assume OP could include everything, every incident bug and small, in it - so if she didn\u2019t they didn\u2019t happen.  \n\n2.
