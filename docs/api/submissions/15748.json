So I might be TA here. \n\nI'm (37F) currently going through a divorce. My husband and I split up a year and a half ago, and it was a painful, hard experience. I'm pretty much over it now, and have come out the other side, ready to move on. \n\nMy mom is very family oriented and loves having photos of family in the house. Her sitting room is full of framed photos of the family. She did have a photo of me and my husband on our wedding day, but after we split, she took it down after I asked her to. Since then, she didn't really have a recent picture of me up (I honestly didn't care  about this).\n\nHowever, when I went over today, she had put up a new pic of me. It was from my wedding day, but is a close up image of just my face, so you wouldn't know it was a wedding photo unless someone told you. However, I instantly recognised it as a picture from my wedding (which was nearly 10 years ago, so not even a recent pic!). \n\nI asked mom to take it down and replace it with a different picture. I said I didn't want to see a pic of me on my wedding day every time I went over. She said that it was a lovely picture of me, it didn't look like a wedding photo, and that I looked so nice on that day, it's a shame to waste the photo. She also said that ultimately its her house, and she can put up any photos she wants, and this is a pic that she likes. \n\nI still dislike it. Am I being an oversensitive asshole who just needs to get over myself?", "created_utc": 1682529274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zqqn1/aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_remove_a_photo_of_me/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This could easily be resolved by just giving her a nice pic of you.", "Info:  would she be willing to replace the photo if you gave her a different pic of yourself?", "YTA. She wants a picture of you and removed anything that showed it was a wedding picture. Instead of being upset with her why don't you select a picture of yourself, print it to the correct size, and the next time you are over replace the picture.", "NAH - You have specific feelings about your wedding, but your mom also wants a good picture of you.  Clearly, she tried to accommodate your feelings so she has done nothing wrong.  You, on the other hand, realize where that picture came from so I can understand why it bothers you.  IMHO - This is a case where you should try and work with her.  Maybe leave it up until you get another good picture.  Maybe, you just swallow your feelings, given the fact that you are the only one that knows where the picture originated.", "Every day I come to Reddit and surpsrised how much conflict there are betwen families for such normal things. \n\nNot sure what is so hard about.\n\n\" Mom I would like for you to hang another picture of me because this one is making me uncomfortable'\n\n\" Ok Hunny, let me know what picture you would like\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are people difficult. \n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nI see a lot of people commenting to gift her a picture of you that you like better. I think I can one up that with this suggestion: plan a photo shoot with you and your mom together, or go out and do something both of you love together and take pictures of the two of you that she can put up, that way you two create a new memory together that's much better than some random picture of you that's just a meaningless replacement. Make it something meaningful that has a lasting memory behind it too.", "NAH.\n\nI get you not wanting to see a wedding picture after going through a painful divorce. \n\nI also see how she might think that careful cropping, so it doesn't look like a wedding photo makes it OK for everyone BUT YOU.\n\nThe best solution? Go get a photo taken and gift it to your mom. Problem solved!", "NTA - Its very reasonable that you wouldnt want your mom to display that picture. Perhaps gift her another picture. \n\nI agree thats its her house and she can display what she wants, but her knowing it upsets you and still keeping up makes her a bit of an AH", "Just print a picture you both like and bring it over", "nah. Your mom does have the right to put whatever pics she wants up, but she should realize you would no where the pic is from and choose another. If she doesn't want to comply, the best you can do  is just to tell her you won't be coming over to her house as long as the pic is up there.", "NAH. Both of you are right. I completely understand not wanting a picture of your wedding, especially since we don\u2019t know the reasons of your split and this may not bring back positive memories. But your mom\u2019s coming from a good place -give her a new picture of you, or even make sure to come nicely dressed next time you go over to take a picture with her to put in a frame", "YTA.\n\n\"I still dislike it. Am I being an oversensitive asshole who just needs to get over myself?\"  \n    \nYes. This exactly. You're being an oversensitive asshole that needs to get over yourself.  It sounds like your mom already tried to meet you half-way by putting up a picture that noone would even know was from your wedding day.  Putting a picture up of a loved on in her own house means the picture is for her, not for you.\n\n\"I'm pretty much over it now, and have come out the other side, ready to move on.\" \n\nMake a choice. Is this true or not?", "Step up. Hire a professional photographer to take some great portraits of you, frame them, and replace the one you don't like. Take initiative.", "NAH and I am sorry people are being complete dicks on here to you. \n\nGet a new photo taken so your Mum can replace the one she has. If she really loves that first photo of you then maybe she can move it to somewhere you won't see it as much.\n\nYou are understandably sensitive about anything to do with your marriage right now, and hopefully that will ease but it takes time. \n\nYour Mum can support you with this by moving some photos around surely?", "Soft YTA because it is her house and her pictures but might I suggest you and your mum go and get a photo session done, just the two of you and make some nice, happy memories for her to frame instead?", "NTA\n\nIf your mom uses an image you find traumatic as a display piece, that makes your Mom a bad mother and an AH.", "NTA, it\u2019s a picture of you on a day you don\u2019t want to think about.

I'd  tell her I would stop visiting if she didn't remove it.", "NAH.  I\u2019d have another talk with her.   You may end up coming over less if it bothers you this much, and I doubt either of you want that. Maybe you can give her another photo in its place?", "YTA. You are in fact being an oversensitive asshole who needs to get over themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: This is a mess of your own making. You know these types of pictures are important to your mother and yet she now has nothing to put up. She's clearly doing and trying her best. You can't either   \nA) get over yourself for your mother who in your own words is loving, kind, and supportive or   \nB) give her a nice new picture. \n\nInstead you're having some sort of pity fit at this woman who means so much to you and you mean so much to.", "NTA, you would be if you threatened to cut her off or something but not for expressing your feelings. No reason she can\u2019t choose another picture for the living room and put that one up in her bedroom, where she can enjoy it and you won\u2019t be upset.", "Nta I think it's reasonable to ask for her to take down the photo, there must be so many photos she can choose from.", "NAH. I don't think anyone is an asshole here. You mom already did you a solid and took down the other pic on your behalf. She's right it's her house and she can do what she wants. If it was a pic including your ex I would think she was being an ass, but her reasoning is solid. I think you are being oversensitive, but not enough to be considered an asshole.", "Sorry that your marriage didn\u2019t work out but YTA.   It\u2019s your Mom\u2019s home and she obliged you and took down the wedding photo. Now you want her to take down a photo of just you?  It\u2019s her home, her choice. \n\nBut, maybe if you had another nice recent photo done she would replace it with that one?", "NTA since it's clearly still a little raw. BUT I also think you should provide some photos for her to use instead. With Mother's Day coming up, it could be a nice gift for her and maybe healing for you.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that you wouldn't be able to tell it's a wedding photo doesn't make it any less a wedding photo!\n\nI'd say take a nice picture with your mom to replace it!", "Taking a selfie and sending it to the 1 hr. Print shop would\u2019ve been quicker than writing this post. \nNAH but just be proactive and solve the issue.", "Soft YTA. Have a friend take a few nice pictures of you, print them out and take it your mom's. She just wants to have a nice picture of  you and probably is the only one she has printed out.", "NTA - It\u2019s very reasonable that you don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded. Maybe try to have a conversation with her, that you don\u2019t say you won\u2019t ever be comfortable with it or she should throw it away, but it\u2019s still too raw. And maybe she\u2019ll do it if you bring another picture along", "YTA. It's her fucking house. Your issues about your divorce are your own.", "SOFT yta. \n\nHave a portrait done and frame it for her for Mother's Day.", "Yta she took the objectionable part out.  You don't have to look at it every day.  \n\nThe obvious solution to me is to have a nice photo shoot done and gift her a current picture of you", "NTA. If I were you I\u2019d bring a preferred pic over and swap it out for her. No joke.", "YTA\n\nMainly bc it is only a big deal bc you are choosing to make it so. It's just not worth it.", "NTA. Perfectly reasonable request.", "NTA\nIt's not unreasonable to ask someone to remove something that makes you uncomfortable or reminds you of something upsetting from an area you frequent. However, she is also allowed to say no but it is a bit of dick move on her part.\nIf she really wants it in her house, ask her to put it somewhere you don't go often (ie her bedroom, spare room, office). A peace offering might be to take some nice photos you have good memories of and get them printed and framed nicely for her to have in place of that photo.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
