So I might be TA here. \n\nI'm (37F) currently going through a divorce. My husband and I split up a year and a half ago, and it was a painful, hard experience. I'm pretty much over it now, and have come out the other side, ready to move on. \n\nMy mom is very family oriented and loves having photos of family in the house. Her sitting room is full of framed photos of the family. She did have a photo of me and my husband on our wedding day, but after we split, she took it down after I asked her to. Since then, she didn't really have a recent picture of me up (I honestly didn't care  about this).\n\nHowever, when I went over today, she had put up a new pic of me. It was from my wedding day, but is a close up image of just my face, so you wouldn't know it was a wedding photo unless someone told you. However, I instantly recognised it as a picture from my wedding (which was nearly 10 years ago, so not even a recent pic!). \n\nI asked mom to take it down and replace it with a different picture. I said I didn't want to see a pic of me on my wedding day every time I went over. She said that it was a lovely picture of me, it didn't look like a wedding photo, and that I looked so nice on that day, it's a shame to waste the photo. She also said that ultimately its her house, and she can put up any photos she wants, and this is a pic that she likes. \n\nI still dislike it. Am I being an oversensitive asshole who just needs to get over myself?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all. Seems the comments seem to be pretty 50/50 over whether I'm being an AH or not. I'm more than willing to admit that I might be in the wrong here. \n\nUltimately I agree that it is her house and she can do what she wants, and if she wants to keep the pic then I can live with it. It's not that big of a deal. I think it just threw me today since I wasn't expecting to see the picture when I went over. I'm not massively traumatised by seeing the photo, but I just look so damn happy on that picture - looking at it just makes me a bit sad. The end of my marriage was sudden and traumatic, and took a lot of processing. I am pretty much over it, but thinking about it does still make me a bit sad. \n\nGifting a new photo might be an idea, but I don't think I'd have them done professionally. It's just not me, and my mum would assume I had had a personality transplant! I do have some nice recent casual pics I could suggest for her perhaps. \n\nAfter posting this, I reflected on whether there might be another reason why it bothers me, and I think the fact that the picture is so old and I don't really look like that any more might be something that irks me a bit. I'm a decade older and look it and a lot greyer and heavier than I was back then! It feels like it's not really a pic of me.\n\nAnyway, thanks all. I am reading and taking on board all your comments.\n\nEDIT 2: Just to add as well (since a lot of people have brought it up) the photo isn't one that was taken by the professional photographer. It was one my mom took herself before the ceremony.", "created_utc": 1682529274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zqqn1/aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_remove_a_photo_of_me/", "score": 797, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact it doesn\u2019t \u201clook like\u201d a wedding photo doesn\u2019t negate the fact it is one, and I completely understand why it would hurt to see it. Offer a replacement photograph of yourself to replace it, or take some photos with you mum to update her collection", "NTA it stings. Why she can't understand that I do not know.\n\nYou could say yes, it is your house. But it is my picture. I don't like seeing it because of the pain associated with that day.\n\nYou may leave it up......but I won't be over while it is up.", "NTA. Is your mom always so passive aggressive? Is this literally the only photo of you to which she had access? If she can crop your wedding photo, she can sure as hell pull one off of social media and print it out.", "This is a case where I\u2019m not really sure anyone did anything wrong here\u2026. You asked her if she\u2019d take it down, and when she declined you didn\u2019t push your agenda or freak out. Maybe I missed something, but my verdict is no one sucks here.", "simply NAH.", "NAH- go get a photo taken of yourself and give it to her. She just wants a nice picture of you. It\u2019s completely understandable that you don\u2019t want a wedding photo on display. I took a hammer to mine- it was very satisfying!", "My lovely, late mother used to frame the most horrendous photos from my schooldays - think awkward pre-teen, gappy teeth, double chin, awful hair - and in the end I...hid them.\n\nShe didn't like the pics I liked of me either though. 'Why are you smiling like that?' so I couldn't win. So many things I wish I'd done include sending her decent pics.", "Give her a photo she can use", "NAH.\n\n\nYou DO need to provide your mom with a good photo of yourself that BOTH of you are okay with.  Honestly, I don't know why this hasn't occurred to you yet.", "NTA. There's literally no other picture your mom can use? Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean you should. Yes she has the right to put up that picture but it seems bizarre to stand ground on that right when it upsets someone you love. You also have the right to no longer visit her because of it but that's childish too- it's a picture. And it's 10 yrs ago! Its extra weird to insist on having an old photo that upsets you rather than a drama free, recent picture. \n\nMother's day is coming up, maybe get a photographer for a family photo shoot as a gift to get some more recent professional pictures? I got my mom this one year, it was like $50 for 30 min and it was so wonderful. Everyone loved it, especially my siblings with little kids. Everyone got great non wedding pictures (we all got married within 4 yrs so a ton of our family photos were just wedding). My mom now gets a photographer whenever we all get together if she can find one. I swear she switches out framed photos for new ones the day after we leave, she gets so excited.", "NTA . The desire to hang up a photo of a family member should not be more important than the feelings of the ACTUAL FAMILY MEMBER. My mom would never do this to me, if fact she asked if I was ok with a pic of me from my honeymoon with my ex husband being on display. It was just of me, and we had an amicable split, so the pic is still there. But if it bothered me, she would have taken it down, no hesitation. Your mom is being weird about this!", "NTA. Like dude you don\u2019t want to have reminders of your wedding and she\u2019s going out of her way to show you them. Tell her To use a new pic or you won\u2019t go there anymore", "NTA but context is everything. she just wants a nice photo of you. give her one of you or get new ones taken. its a solution that fits everyone just fine. this just seems well blown out of proportion. very simple fix", "NAH. Your mom doesn\u2019t have malicious intention, and I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t want to hurt you. Tell her it\u2019s painful to remember your wedding every time you see that photo, because even if it\u2019s not apparent to strangers-you remember that moment every time you see it. I would take a nice new photo for yourself and gift it to her a peace offering.", "NAH, you weren\u2019t an asshole for asking, she\u2019s not an asshole for saying no. It sounds like she already made the photo as inoffensive as possible, but I understand how seeing pictures from a previous marriage can make you feel weird. \n\nBut, if you do keep insisting my judgement would shift.", "NAH. It would be a really cute idea to get some nice photos taken or take one yourself with a nice frame to replace it. \n\nThat way you both win and it\u2019s a thoughtful gift which might reconcile some of this.", "NTA, but you should probably help your mom find a new picture of you to put up.", "NTA. Maybe use this as an opportunity to get some new family photos done with your mom and other family members. Then she can have some more recent and appropriate photos of you.", "This is easy to fix. 1. You told your mom you dont like that picture. She does. 2. Stop going over....when she calls and asks why arent you coming over just say you have the right to have any picture you want and i have the right not to look at that picture due to the bad memories. As long as its up i wont be coming over. If you want me over then remove the picture before i get there.", "NTA BUT if you don't want the picture there give her an alternative to put up", "I\u2019m going with NTA because of the bad memories you\u2019ll have every time you see the photo. Perhaps you can get a nice one printed for her to replace it with? \n\nMy grandmother has a terrible photo of me that I absolutely hate frames in her home. Ok, whatever, but she actually had an oil painting made from print and gifted it to my mother. My mom also hates the painting and OG photo.", "NTA about the pic, but it\u2019s weird to me that you resist doing one decent current pic and framing it for your mom as a gift.", "I vote NAH. As written, the mom isn't against changing photos. I think other posts have the right idea that OP can provide a new photo to replace it. \n\nAlternatively, give the okay for mom to put the photo anywhere else, such as her own bedroom, where it can be Out of Sight, Out of Mind for the OP.", "Here for reads. I have this issue myself. Hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. Empathy for you, I relate to this. Best of wishes for all involved.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t go over until it\u2019s removed.  After all it\u2019s your moms house.  She can choose what is more important.", "NTA but you dont get to choose what your mom decides to remember. Or what she hangs in her house.\n\nMy daughter has a photo of me,her and her dad in her room. I dont mind it because that's her childhood to remember. Our love didnt last but it was real at one time.", "NTA. Just don\u2019t go over there very often she\u2019ll start to get the hint.", "NTA and what a petty thing to pull the whole \u201cit\u2019s my house I can do what I want\u201d stuff over. Sometimes this sub is only focused on what\u2019s technically true/correct and commenters forget to have empathy. Like yes it\u2019s her house and she\u2019s within her rights to have the picture up, but why she\u2019d prioritize filling a spot on her wall over your feelings is beyond me. \n\nIn general I think people should have a say in what goes on with pictures of themselves, particularly if it\u2019s a photo of *only* you. The wedding day + you being older and looking different now aspects are totally valid reasons for you to be uncomfortable, but they\u2019re almost irrelevant to me tbh. Whatever the reason, if you tell your mom you\u2019re not comfortable with her displaying a picture of you, that should matter to her.", "NTA. I find it suspicious that she put up a photo of you, in either the midst or aftermath of your divorce (a traumatic thing to go through) of you on your wedding day from ten years ago.", "Yep- your the ass, get over it and allow her to enjoy your picture, she obviously loved the picture,  so what does it hurt?", " NAH a friend of mine is having this fight with her mother over old pics before her transition.\n\nThere\u2019s no ill intent here, it\u2019s reasonable you\u2019d get upset at images that bring bad memories. \nAnd bad memories is not the point of displaying pictures.\n\nI feel your mom should replace the image with one you both like. Especially if she cares about how that image makes you uncomfortable.\n\nAs a child of divorce I know my parents wouldn\u2019t  take kindly to displaying wedding pics of each other when they visit.", "Nobody is the AH. I think everyone has said all the suggestions about getting her a new photo or what-not, but I would offer this: photos are a memory captured. You mentioned in your edit that maybe it bothers you because it is a decade ago - that it doesn\u2019t feel like you anymore. Consider this: do you have pictures of you when you when you were a child? What about at a funeral? What about before an important life event? Are you the same person now as you were in those photos? Probably not. The joy in your face in that photo can be considered a bittersweet memory of a past self (like the picture of you at a loved ones funeral). Your life has changed and altered, but this will always be a part of you. You have the opportunity to make better memories, and offer your mother those photos, but if she chooses to keep the photo up, it\u2019s only because she likes seeing you that happy. It\u2019s a memory capture of when you had true joy.", "Nta, but gently toward mom. I bet she would LOVE a new pic just for her.", "For everyone who suggests having a new photo taken- that does not guarantee the mother will remove the wedding photo. Picture frames are cheap and plentiful.", "You should gift her a photo shoot w the 2 of you with a local photographer. Everyone wins!", "NTA it's perfectly ok to ask not to see a picture that hurts you every times you go see her, she can find a picture from an other day", "Leave it out ffs \ud83e\udd23", "I'm going to withhold judgement, but I will say that there is a relatively simple solution.\n\nProvide her with an equally nice portrait of yourself as you are now to hang instead of the wedding photo.\n\nI saw that you aren't usually one for professional photos, but I think it would be appropriate given the photo you aim to replace was professionally taken and edited. Even just finding a friend or acquaintance with a decent camera and some editing skills, and paying them for their help, would be good. If you can do it soon it would make a lovely mother's day gift.", "From a person whose mother never put up my pics, abused and neglected me even when I loved her blindly.\nI legit just started crying. Just wow.", "Tbh NAH but like also slight E S H if that makes sense? Like I get the feeling you're talking about, it may not be something other people realize to be your wedding picture but you see it. I have pics like that from when I was at my lowest mentally - one specific my mom really loves which to me is so wild because I had literally just been forced to move back home with them because I was completely unable to take care of myself. So seeing pictures like that, is a cruel reminder of the pain associated with that time period?\n\nBut your mom is also not an ahole bc she doesn't see the photo as a reminder of your wedding, but as a beautiful pic of you. She means no harm and wants to show off her child. The E S H part is that she won't remove it even tho you have explained it, but also I get that to her it might seem irrational as it's not an obvious wedding picture. Like she is not present inside your head and in your lived experience, so she can't fully understand where you're coming from. \n\nSo either you have to stand your ground and somehow make her remove it, which is where your part of the E S H comes into play imo - or you have to just ignore it as best as you can, and if there are a lot of pictures, maybe you can move it to the back so it won't be so in your face? Like come up with some compromise in a way?\n\nBut also one day you may be able to see those pictures without feeling the freshness of your divorce. Because right now it is still quite fresh, even if you are starting to get back up. So allow yourself time and try compromise with your mom as it doesn't sound like there are any bad intentions, hence why I land on NAH as my final vote.", "NAH but definitely get some recent photos printed for her (by an actual printer who can photo print them; not just on printer paper).", "NTA. I think people saying you are, are insensitive.", "Schedule a photo session for you and your mom together! Mother\u2019s Day gift idea! \nNTA", "NTA.  Late entry, but your mother is being extremely insensitive.  Just don't go to her house anymore.  Tell her you will meet her in a restaurant or park, but not her house and tell her why.", "I'd have to say a soft YTA. Totally understand the position you are coming from but at the end of the day it's your mom's house so she can do what she likes. Maybe do some kind of nice night out with your mom and get some photos taken even just on your phone of the two of ye that she could put up.", "Why not have a photo session of just you and your mom (and sisters if you have them) or you could gift your mom a nice photo of you in a nice frame.", "NTA - it might be a lovely picture of you for your mum, and for anyone else, but for you it is your wedding day, and so is charged with the emotions from the end of the marriage - who'd want that? Surely your mum can see that it might hurt you sometimes when you see it? She's not the NTA either, but it's a bit insensitive", "Find a local photographer, get some photos printed give them to your mum as a gift\n\nCheckmate.", "Yes your being overly sensitive but not the Ahole. Why don\u2019t you suggest to your mom that you take a pic together and that be the pic to put up. Moms are stubborn when it comes to family stuff in their own house. Good luck with that!", "You are definitely NTA. Regardless of your reason, your mother should respect your discomfort and support you. \n\nThe suggestions from others that you provide your own picture are preposterous, imo. If this was one of my children, I would like to think that I would have taken your request for the wedding photo being taken down to mean no pictures from that day. Your mom might be well meaning, but she seems to have missed the mark here.", "Ffs YTA.", "You don't like the photo? Take a new one, frame it, and give it to her.", "NTA, it might be a nice picture but it gives you pain. I think your mom should be sympathetic toward that.", "NAH - Neither of you are assholes. She has the right to put up whatever she wants in her house, you have the right to not like seeing a certain photo. It does seem like even before she put up the photo, she considered your feelings, by cropping your ex husband out of the photograph. A child's wedding is a big day for parents, so she probably has some sentimental feelings over the picture of you.", "I know you said it's just not you, but I truly think you deserve a full service galmour shoot day. It's a great way to move on for a ton of reasons, and then you have these lovely pictures of you for yourself to look at in 20/40/60 years\n\nDo a mother daughter one! Then you'll have them of her as well. You don't want to have to look at old wedding photos for a nice dressy shot of your mother.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps, as an alternative, you could have someone take pictures of you and your mom, so she could have a new one to display?", "As someone who also went through a sudden and traumatic separation (divorce papers filed, waiting on courts), my mom not taking down my wedding photos/removing them from the digital picture frames was TORTURE. Yeah, you can be totally fine and have processed it but having those photos in your face is a gut punch. Hell, the other photos from my wedding that don't involve my ex or I STILL being up in her house hurts. It's all memories of a guy who, after 9 years together, told me he never loved me at all and did some other really traumatic stuff to me. NTA.", "NAH. I think it was fair for you to ask but it\u2019s also fair for her to respond the way she did. Sometimes no one is an asshole and it\u2019s just an uncomfortable situation.", "I find it a bit insensitive to put up a picture taken on your wedding day and refusing to take it down although it causes you distress. She shouldn\u2019t value having the picture up more than your feelings. Gift her a new picture hopefully she\u2019ll take it down", "ESH.. seems like it was innocent enough and that your mother loves you and photos.

It\u2019s her house, but it\u2019s a picture of you\u2026I would think she would want a picture that you\u2019re happy with, not one that maybe brings up painful memories, or, like you said, just doesn\u2019t seem like a reflection of you are anymore. I hope that she also reflects a bit and the two of you are able to agree on a newer photo.", "NTA\n\nYou expressed your discomfort with good reason.

A classmate of mine did that for her 16th birthday party.", "Go with mom and get some pictures taken together", "Parents love photos as gifts. OP could go and do a special photoshoot and take new photos. That way everyone wins. Their mom gets a new updated photo and OP gets the wedding photo removed. \n\nIt doesn't have to be a professional photo shoot (although that would be nice for mom and likely good for confidence for OP). You can go and have a friend take a couple nice photos out and about.", "I agree, but it doesn't make OP TA.", "Great solution.  Another great idea is to get a professional shot of you and mom together.  Add Dad if he's around.  That should please her.", "I was gonna suggest this. I say NAH. You asked and she said no.

People can change a lot in 10 years and OP says they have some, why choose a photo that is so old, when it\u2019s also slightly upsetting. I got some new photos for my family to display of me, they had junior photos of my highschool band photos and I just hated myself and everything at that time, looking at it in every fridge is kinda off putting, I gave them new photos of me, and even a few with me and my partner and now I get to see photos of myself in a place I\u2019m happy at, not some old sad photos.", "Probably the only somewhat recent professional picture.\n\nThere's a lot of work that goes into that and that shows.", "Naa it is massively tone deaf of OPs mom. May be nobody else will realise its OPs wedding photo but that doesn't change the fact that OP knows!

It's not a recent photo or a photo of something that is a particularly happy memory at this point post divorce. \n\nI can understand why she thought it might be OK to use a photo from the wedding that wasn't obviously weddingish, but now she knows it upsets OP why would she want her daughter to feel pain every time she visits just for the sake of a photo?", "Could be either way tbh", "I agree. I can\u2019t imagine keeping a photo up that my kids found hurtful or traumatic. This is such a bizarre hill to die on as a parent, surely there are a lot of happy and lovely photos that could be substituted here.

That definitely trumps the whole failed marriage reminder thing.", "This is where I am. If someone asked me to not use a 10 yr old picture from their wedding after a divorce, I would take it down even if you couldn't tell it was a wedding picture. Why? Because I care enough about them to hang their picture on my wall!!!! \n\nI get that professional pictures are special but then hire someone for $50 to get new pictures. If you don't have nice pictures of your children to hang from the past 10 years then I don't want to hear about how important pictures are. I cringe when a house is filled with only really old / outdated photos of people (which I don't know about ops mom, she may have new photos around as well but that also makes it more frustrating to have an old one of op).", "OP never asked not to have pictures of herself on the wall. There are likely several others (like first Day of school or the like) it's just the wedding photo she wanted taken down.\n\nHer mum probably took that as please take down pictures of my ex. Which she did.", "It's not the only person it matters to though, is it? A parent seeing their child getting married, \"all grown up\", means something to the parent too. A parent who has also seemingly gone out of their way, without being asked, to remove both the ex husband and any imagery of the wedding. At that point, you're dictating what someone does in their house, when they've already tried accommodating you.", "Which is fine, but now OP has explained more clearly that all photos of her from the wedding are upsetting to her why would she want to carry on hurting her daughter?", "This. It\u2019s probably the last time OP had photos done that were not head shots for work.", "I think she's just frustrated that she went through all that trouble and it wasn't appreciated. Chances are she already took it down."]}
