So I might be TA here. \n\nI'm (37F) currently going through a divorce. My husband and I split up a year and a half ago, and it was a painful, hard experience. I'm pretty much over it now, and have come out the other side, ready to move on. \n\nMy mom is very family oriented and loves having photos of family in the house. Her sitting room is full of framed photos of the family. She did have a photo of me and my husband on our wedding day, but after we split, she took it down after I asked her to. Since then, she didn't really have a recent picture of me up (I honestly didn't care  about this).\n\nHowever, when I went over today, she had put up a new pic of me. It was from my wedding day, but is a close up image of just my face, so you wouldn't know it was a wedding photo unless someone told you. However, I instantly recognised it as a picture from my wedding (which was nearly 10 years ago, so not even a recent pic!). \n\nI asked mom to take it down and replace it with a different picture. I said I didn't want to see a pic of me on my wedding day every time I went over. She said that it was a lovely picture of me, it didn't look like a wedding photo, and that I looked so nice on that day, it's a shame to waste the photo. She also said that ultimately its her house, and she can put up any photos she wants, and this is a pic that she likes. \n\nI still dislike it. Am I being an oversensitive asshole who just needs to get over myself?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all. Seems the comments seem to be pretty 50/50 over whether I'm being an AH or not. I'm more than willing to admit that I might be in the wrong here. \n\nUltimately I agree that it is her house and she can do what she wants, and if she wants to keep the pic then I can live with it. It's not that big of a deal. I think it just threw me today since I wasn't expecting to see the picture when I went over. I'm not massively traumatised by seeing the photo, but I just look so damn happy on that picture - looking at it just makes me a bit sad. The end of my marriage was sudden and traumatic, and took a lot of processing. I am pretty much over it, but thinking about it does still make me a bit sad. \n\nGifting a new photo might be an idea, but I don't think I'd have them done professionally. It's just not me, and my mum would assume I had had a personality transplant! I do have some nice recent casual pics I could suggest for her perhaps. \n\nAfter posting this, I reflected on whether there might be another reason why it bothers me, and I think the fact that the picture is so old and I don't really look like that any more might be something that irks me a bit. I'm a decade older and look it and a lot greyer and heavier than I was back then! It feels like it's not really a pic of me.\n\nAnyway, thanks all. I am reading and taking on board all your comments.\n\nEDIT 2: Just to add as well (since a lot of people have brought it up) the photo isn't one that was taken by the professional photographer. It was one my mom took herself before the ceremony.", "created_utc": 1682529274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zqqn1/aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_remove_a_photo_of_me/", "score": 3062, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact it doesn\u2019t \u201clook like\u201d a wedding photo doesn\u2019t negate the fact it is one, and I completely understand why it would hurt to see it. Offer a replacement photograph of yourself to replace it, or take some photos with you mum to update her collection", "NTA it stings. Why she can't understand that I do not know.\n\nYou could say yes, it is your house. But it is my picture. I don't like seeing it because of the pain associated with that day.\n\nYou may leave it up......but I won't be over while it is up.", "NTA. Is your mom always so passive aggressive? Is this literally the only photo of you to which she had access? If she can crop your wedding photo, she can sure as hell pull one off of social media and print it out.", "This is a case where I\u2019m not really sure anyone did anything wrong here\u2026. You asked her if she\u2019d take it down, and when she declined you didn\u2019t push your agenda or freak out. Maybe I missed something, but my verdict is no one sucks here.", "simply NAH.", "NAH- go get a photo taken of yourself and give it to her. She just wants a nice picture of you. It\u2019s completely understandable that you don\u2019t want a wedding photo on display. I took a hammer to mine- it was very satisfying!", "My lovely, late mother used to frame the most horrendous photos from my schooldays - think awkward pre-teen, gappy teeth, double chin, awful hair - and in the end I...hid them.\n\nShe didn't like the pics I liked of me either though. 'Why are you smiling like that?' so I couldn't win. So many things I wish I'd done include sending her decent pics.", "Give her a photo she can use", "NAH.\n\n\nYou DO need to provide your mom with a good photo of yourself that BOTH of you are okay with.  Honestly, I don't know why this hasn't occurred to you yet.", "NTA. There's literally no other picture your mom can use? Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean you should. Yes she has the right to put up that picture but it seems bizarre to stand ground on that right when it upsets someone you love. You also have the right to no longer visit her because of it but that's childish too- it's a picture. And it's 10 yrs ago! Its extra weird to insist on having an old photo that upsets you rather than a drama free, recent picture. \n\nMother's day is coming up, maybe get a photographer for a family photo shoot as a gift to get some more recent professional pictures? I got my mom this one year, it was like $50 for 30 min and it was so wonderful. Everyone loved it, especially my siblings with little kids. Everyone got great non wedding pictures (we all got married within 4 yrs so a ton of our family photos were just wedding). My mom now gets a photographer whenever we all get together if she can find one. I swear she switches out framed photos for new ones the day after we leave, she gets so excited.", "NTA . The desire to hang up a photo of a family member should not be more important than the feelings of the ACTUAL FAMILY MEMBER. My mom would never do this to me, if fact she asked if I was ok with a pic of me from my honeymoon with my ex husband being on display. It was just of me, and we had an amicable split, so the pic is still there. But if it bothered me, she would have taken it down, no hesitation. Your mom is being weird about this!", "NTA. Like dude you don\u2019t want to have reminders of your wedding and she\u2019s going out of her way to show you them. Tell her To use a new pic or you won\u2019t go there anymore", "NTA but context is everything. she just wants a nice photo of you. give her one of you or get new ones taken. its a solution that fits everyone just fine. this just seems well blown out of proportion. very simple fix", "NAH. Your mom doesn\u2019t have malicious intention, and I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t want to hurt you. Tell her it\u2019s painful to remember your wedding every time you see that photo, because even if it\u2019s not apparent to strangers-you remember that moment every time you see it. I would take a nice new photo for yourself and gift it to her a peace offering.", "NAH, you weren\u2019t an asshole for asking, she\u2019s not an asshole for saying no. It sounds like she already made the photo as inoffensive as possible, but I understand how seeing pictures from a previous marriage can make you feel weird. \n\nBut, if you do keep insisting my judgement would shift.", "NAH. It would be a really cute idea to get some nice photos taken or take one yourself with a nice frame to replace it. \n\nThat way you both win and it\u2019s a thoughtful gift which might reconcile some of this.", "NTA, but you should probably help your mom find a new picture of you to put up.", "NTA. Maybe use this as an opportunity to get some new family photos done with your mom and other family members. Then she can have some more recent and appropriate photos of you.", "This is easy to fix. 1. You told your mom you dont like that picture. She does. 2. Stop going over....when she calls and asks why arent you coming over just say you have the right to have any picture you want and i have the right not to look at that picture due to the bad memories. As long as its up i wont be coming over. If you want me over then remove the picture before i get there.", "NTA BUT if you don't want the picture there give her an alternative to put up", "I\u2019m going with NTA because of the bad memories you\u2019ll have every time you see the photo. Perhaps you can get a nice one printed for her to replace it with? \n\nMy grandmother has a terrible photo of me that I absolutely hate frames in her home. Ok, whatever, but she actually had an oil painting made from print and gifted it to my mother. My mom also hates the painting and OG photo.", "NTA about the pic, but it\u2019s weird to me that you resist doing one decent current pic and framing it for your mom as a gift.", "I vote NAH. As written, the mom isn't against changing photos. I think other posts have the right idea that OP can provide a new photo to replace it. \n\nAlternatively, give the okay for mom to put the photo anywhere else, such as her own bedroom, where it can be Out of Sight, Out of Mind for the OP.", "Here for reads. I have this issue myself. Hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. Empathy for you, I relate to this. Best of wishes for all involved.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t go over until it\u2019s removed.  After all it\u2019s your moms house.  She can choose what is more important.", "NTA but you dont get to choose what your mom decides to remember. Or what she hangs in her house.\n\nMy daughter has a photo of me,her and her dad in her room. I dont mind it because that's her childhood to remember. Our love didnt last but it was real at one time.", "NTA. Just don\u2019t go over there very often she\u2019ll start to get the hint.", "NTA and what a petty thing to pull the whole \u201cit\u2019s my house I can do what I want\u201d stuff over. Sometimes this sub is only focused on what\u2019s technically true/correct and commenters forget to have empathy. Like yes it\u2019s her house and she\u2019s within her rights to have the picture up, but why she\u2019d prioritize filling a spot on her wall over your feelings is beyond me. \n\nIn general I think people should have a say in what goes on with pictures of themselves, particularly if it\u2019s a photo of *only* you. The wedding day + you being older and looking different now aspects are totally valid reasons for you to be uncomfortable, but they\u2019re almost irrelevant to me tbh. Whatever the reason, if you tell your mom you\u2019re not comfortable with her displaying a picture of you, that should matter to her.", "NTA. I find it suspicious that she put up a photo of you, in either the midst or aftermath of your divorce (a traumatic thing to go through) of you on your wedding day from ten years ago.", "Yep- your the ass, get over it and allow her to enjoy your picture, she obviously loved the picture,  so what does it hurt?", " NAH a friend of mine is having this fight with her mother over old pics before her transition.\n\nThere\u2019s no ill intent here, it\u2019s reasonable you\u2019d get upset at images that bring bad memories. \nAnd bad memories is not the point of displaying pictures.\n\nI feel your mom should replace the image with one you both like. Especially if she cares about how that image makes you uncomfortable.\n\nAs a child of divorce I know my parents wouldn\u2019t  take kindly to displaying wedding pics of each other when they visit.", "Nobody is the AH. I think everyone has said all the suggestions about getting her a new photo or what-not, but I would offer this: photos are a memory captured. You mentioned in your edit that maybe it bothers you because it is a decade ago - that it doesn\u2019t feel like you anymore. Consider this: do you have pictures of you when you when you were a child? What about at a funeral? What about before an important life event? Are you the same person now as you were in those photos? Probably not. The joy in your face in that photo can be considered a bittersweet memory of a past self (like the picture of you at a loved ones funeral). Your life has changed and altered, but this will always be a part of you. You have the opportunity to make better memories, and offer your mother those photos, but if she chooses to keep the photo up, it\u2019s only because she likes seeing you that happy. It\u2019s a memory capture of when you had true joy.", "Nta, but gently toward mom. I bet she would LOVE a new pic just for her.", "For everyone who suggests having a new photo taken- that does not guarantee the mother will remove the wedding photo. Picture frames are cheap and plentiful.", "You should gift her a photo shoot w the 2 of you with a local photographer. Everyone wins!", "NTA it's perfectly ok to ask not to see a picture that hurts you every times you go see her, she can find a picture from an other day", "Leave it out ffs \ud83e\udd23", "I'm going to withhold judgement, but I will say that there is a relatively simple solution.\n\nProvide her with an equally nice portrait of yourself as you are now to hang instead of the wedding photo.\n\nI saw that you aren't usually one for professional photos, but I think it would be appropriate given the photo you aim to replace was professionally taken and edited. Even just finding a friend or acquaintance with a decent camera and some editing skills, and paying them for their help, would be good. If you can do it soon it would make a lovely mother's day gift.", "From a person whose mother never put up my pics, abused and neglected me even when I loved her blindly.\nI legit just started crying. Just wow.", "Tbh NAH but like also slight E S H if that makes sense? Like I get the feeling you're talking about, it may not be something other people realize to be your wedding picture but you see it. I have pics like that from when I was at my lowest mentally - one specific my mom really loves which to me is so wild because I had literally just been forced to move back home with them because I was completely unable to take care of myself. So seeing pictures like that, is a cruel reminder of the pain associated with that time period?\n\nBut your mom is also not an ahole bc she doesn't see the photo as a reminder of your wedding, but as a beautiful pic of you. She means no harm and wants to show off her child. The E S H part is that she won't remove it even tho you have explained it, but also I get that to her it might seem irrational as it's not an obvious wedding picture. Like she is not present inside your head and in your lived experience, so she can't fully understand where you're coming from. \n\nSo either you have to stand your ground and somehow make her remove it, which is where your part of the E S H comes into play imo - or you have to just ignore it as best as you can, and if there are a lot of pictures, maybe you can move it to the back so it won't be so in your face? Like come up with some compromise in a way?\n\nBut also one day you may be able to see those pictures without feeling the freshness of your divorce. Because right now it is still quite fresh, even if you are starting to get back up. So allow yourself time and try compromise with your mom as it doesn't sound like there are any bad intentions, hence why I land on NAH as my final vote.", "NAH but definitely get some recent photos printed for her (by an actual printer who can photo print them; not just on printer paper).", "NTA.

Totally understand the position you are coming from but at the end of the day it's your mom's house so she can do what she likes.

Good luck with that!", "You are definitely NTA. Regardless of your reason, your mother should respect your discomfort and support you. \n\nThe suggestions from others that you provide your own picture are preposterous, imo.

She has the right to put up whatever she wants in her house, you have the right to not like seeing a certain photo. It does seem like even before she put up the photo, she considered your feelings, by cropping your ex husband out of the photograph. A child's wedding is a big day for parents, so she probably has some sentimental feelings over the picture of you.", "I know you said it's just not you, but I truly think you deserve a full service galmour shoot day.

Then you'll have them of her as well. You don't want to have to look at old wedding photos for a nice dressy shot of your mother.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps, as an alternative, you could have someone take pictures of you and your mom, so she could have a new one to display?", "As someone who also went through a sudden and traumatic separation (divorce papers filed, waiting on courts), my mom not taking down my wedding photos/removing them from the digital picture frames was TORTURE. Yeah, you can be totally fine and have processed it but having those photos in your face is a gut punch. Hell, the other photos from my wedding that don't involve my ex or I STILL being up in her house hurts.

I can\u2019t imagine keeping a photo up that my kids found hurtful or traumatic. This is such a bizarre hill to die on as a parent, surely there are a lot of happy and lovely photos that could be substituted here.

That definitely trumps the whole failed marriage reminder thing.", "This is where I am.

If you don't have nice pictures of your children to hang from the past 10 years then I don't want to hear about how important pictures are. I cringe when a house is filled with only really old / outdated photos of people (which I don't know about ops mom, she may have new photos around as well but that also makes it more frustrating to have an old one of op).", "OP never asked not to have pictures of herself on the wall.

At that point, you're dictating what someone does in their house, when they've already tried accommodating you.", "Which is fine, but now OP has explained more clearly that all photos of her from the wedding are upsetting to her why would she want to carry on hurting her daughter?", "This. It\u2019s probably the last time OP had photos done that were not head shots for work.", "I think she's just frustrated that she went through all that trouble and it wasn't appreciated. Chances are she already took it down.", "This would have been N A H if she had just accepted your explanation that you don't want any wedding photos displayed.

By the time we get to where we are, 10 years is a lot of lived life.\n\nMy suggestion, have someone....it can be a friend, family member...anyone, take a picture of you and your Mom TOGETHER for her to have.

If she is such a wonderful mom, why would she really want you to constantly see a photo that causes you pain? Does she understand how much it bothers you?", "NTA. I think there is plenty kf room for compromise, and you have acknowledged this, but NTA because ultimately your mom is putting her desire for a nice photo over your very real feelings about your life and your marriage during a difficult time. She should be more supportive and dismay this \"favorite photo\" elsewhere where you won't see it. \n\nShe should have suggested doing photos together, or you could do that as well.

For one of her milestone birthdays, we set up a professional photographer for the whole family, and gave her individual photos.

I can see both sides, and it seems like you didn\u2019t push it too much so it\u2019s not a huge thing. \n\nI think another reason it may bother you a bit is that you are not the person in that picture anymore. Changes in looks aside, emotionally/psychologically you are not her. We change all the time as we grow, age, learn, and experience different things. That picture represents who you used to be, before experiencing the end of a marriage. The person that day doesn\u2019t know what you now know. It could also bother you on a deeper level of any unaddressed feelings that can come with the ending of a marriage. Regret, shame, anger, betrayal are the usuals. If those aren\u2019t fully addressed, seeing that photo could trigger a re-emerging of those feelings. Give yourself some time, and check in with yourself. You may need to work through a few emotions that linger.", "NAH\n\nI understand why your mom wants a photo of you.  But at the same time the photo she has chosen seems quite traumatising to you.\n\nI see you've had some good suggestions.  Best one is a new, recent photo (doesn't have to be professional).  Especially if you don't mind having your photo taken.  You might have friends that have taken candid shots on their phones that might be suitable.\n\nIf your mom insists on keeping this picture up, if it was me, I would find myself not visiting often at her house - doesn't mean you can't have over to yours or meet at other places.\n\nYou need time to heal from the divorce and it's a very raw wound right now.", "No one is the A here I feel like. You\u2019re having some (sorry for wording it this way but) big feelings, which you\u2019re entitled to, but your mom took that photo, she probably treasures it.

It was a photo taken by her mom of OP when she's not in her wedding dress. So it's probably a really happy memory for the mom of being with her daughter getting ready on top of being a nice photo of OP. I agree she should swap it but it makes sense that's it's sentimental.", "My thought too!", "Yessss. I feel like it would be similar to having a photo where someone looks great but they were struggling with an eating disorder at the time.", "Yeah I totally get OP\u2019s perspective too but from the mom\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s possible this is the only photo she has of OP that isn\u2019t 15+ years old (college graduation) or would have to be printed from social media.", "Haha, it's so true. For Christmas a few years ago, I had gotten my wife a cute photo I had taken of our daughter that she had never seen before.

I understand your feelings because I had a similar situation with my own parents. I get it because it's their house and I have no say in what they put up on their walls, but it also made me a bit sad/on the verge of a panic attack because I was with my ex for over a decade and the way we ended was awful. I basically packed my entire life in two suitcases and fled to where he couldn't find me because either I was literally going to have another stroke (I've had four, three of which were before I turned 24) or he was going unalive me by pulling the trigger of his weapon that he used to point at my head.
