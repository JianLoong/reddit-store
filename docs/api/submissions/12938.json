We walked past Victoria's secret and my friend, who I'll call Emily, asked why I wasn't wearing a bra. I told her I don't like to wear them. She thinks that because I am a woman I should always be wearing a bra. I told her once again I'm comfortable without wearing it. She asked me if I was trying to be funny or really want to be a whore. I told her that I didn't tell her off for doing or wearing things I don't like so she shouldn't do that to me. She said that if I wanted to be a disgusting asshole than I could find my own way home.\n\nI ended up getting an Uber home and texting Emily that I will wear whatever I want whenever I want and that she could fuck off.

Because seriously. One VS bras aren't exactly made for larger Busta esp if you got an odd band size. Two they are super expensive.\n\nAlso. Wearing a bra or not doesn't make a person a whore. Regardless if it's worn or not.\n\nApparently I am one cause I'm braless 90 percent of the time! I even went braless at work! It doesn't matter! As long as my nips ain't visible I don't give a damn. I wore a tank top then my employee uniform (smock cause I'm a housekeeper) you can't tell! And I'm busty.\n\nWould Emily give you shit if you wore a binder? Or corset? Cause I can speak of experience that wearing a bra with a corset (full body corset not a underwire kind or one without breast cups) hurts like shit after a while.\n\nShould you have said fuck off? May not. But she shouldn't have called you a whore for not wearing a piece of clothing.\n\nAlso next time she starts up ask if a little girl should wear a bra since apparently it's a intro to whorehood if you don't wear one. Or what about the girls who don't have breasts yet/or had to have them removed or are small enough to go without a bra without it being noticable (like A cup etc) are they entering whorehood? No. Because we wear them for various reasons and have the right to say screw the discomfort. \n\nYou ain't wrong she is.
