I told her that I didn't tell her off for doing or wearing things I don't like so she shouldn't do that to me. She said that if I wanted to be a disgusting asshole than I could find my own way home.\n\nI ended up getting an Uber home and texting Emily that I will wear whatever I want whenever I want and that she could fuck off.

May not.

Or what about the girls who don't have breasts yet/or had to have them removed or are small enough to go without a bra without it being noticable (like A cup etc) are they entering whorehood? No. Because we wear them for various reasons and have the right to say screw the discomfort. \n\nYou ain't wrong she is.

I\u2019m 40, busty (no kids so they stayed out) and SHOULD wear a bra but stopped. Because bras suck. I can also confirm it has not made me a whore. But it has made me more comfortable.

You weren\u2019t going out of your way to dress inappropriately.", "ESH. You\u2019re out in public and need to dress appropriately and like a respectable adult. Period. She could have handled it differently and if she knew you don\u2019t wear them could have not invited you at all, which would have been more ideal. Knowing how you dress and choose to behave in public, there was no reason for her to invite you but she did and then once you were there she made a big deal of it and suggested you find another way home. This entire story sounds fictional or at least has a lot left out but I\u2019ll play along and vote on it as is which is everyone is the AH here. If you were my friend, I would have gone in public with you exactly one time and then never again. For the record, I am a woman and not what I would call prudish by any standard.", "NTA.

It took me another year to be able to comfortably wear any sort of bra. Anyone who said anything got told to mind their business. What you choose to wear is up to you, as long as it covers the important bits and is appropriate for the setting. Whatever reason you have for deciding to not wear a bra is valid and your decision. You were right to tell her to F off. Ask your friends if they would like to be called a whore because they don\u2019t want to wear a bra?", "NTA, darlin I haven\u2019t worn a daily bra in years. I only wear them for specific things like work, weddings, etc. \nnot wearing a bra doesn\u2019t automatically make you anything other than comfortable.", "NTA but as  you age, they will remain in better condition if you wear one.

You only have to wear a bra at your work IF they require it. And even then there's likely exceptions, example I can get away with a camisole style top that has like a built in shelf with a blouse over that. Can't see nips and boots are  supported enough for me. It's more about your own physical comfort. Only other time I think a bra is necessary is if your wearing a tank top with a really low cut arm pit and half your boob is hanging out/visible then a sports bra is probably recommended IF you are out in public.", "I mean, NTA, but your definition of \"friends\" and mine seem to differ wildly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She asked me if I was trying to be funny or really want to be a whore.

Gotta say often AITA post titles are not the actual issue but a) Emily has some strong feelings and thats weird  b) bras arent mandatory to wear c( if your nipples are showing or something is looking indecent definitely consider one. So NTA for not wearing a bra but def evaluate based on every situation what to wear or not wear (ie at work).\n\nAlso find new friends, cause WTF", "NTA. I don't like the feeling of a bra either against my chest, and to this day I haven't found one that fit just right or made me feel like it was crushing my chest. I can't stand tight clothes especially around my chest, it will drive me up the wall all-day and I'll be picking at it all day. It's my choice and it's your choice to not wear one, it doesn't make you W. It's women that wear revealing shirts and have the tightest bra on as possible that give off that W vibe. Emily doesn't sound like a friend I'd have around, cut her and whatever other toxic so called friends out of your life and don't bother giving them that attention. Meaning block there numbers and all of there social media from yours.

My body, which looks and functions exactly like it's supposed to, is something I'm supposed to be ashamed of if there is not an extra layer of fabric between *my nipples and my shirt*?

Point is, I would never tell anyone to wear a bra.\n\nSince you mentioned that it feels as \"if they are squishing\" your breasts, you should definitely go to be fitted for a bra (for when you need/want one).

What more should I expect? \n\nThen I went to A Bra Shoppe where I got an actual fitting. I'm a G cup. I also found out I, and most women, are wearing bras way too high in the back, and our bust is too low in the front. We are all geeked up in our bras! We are upping band size when we should be going up cup sizes, but good luck finding a G cup at Target! \n\nNo more sore boobs. No more shoulder/neck headaches.

Ofc I think that anyone who feels more comfortable without one shouldn't wear one.\n\nAgree OP defo NTA\n\nPeople really care about all the wrong things- like policing other people's clothes.

If you\u2019re always in a bra, those tissues are free to get very weak. I read this 25 years ago when I was in my late teens and took it to heart. I wear a bra only when absolutely necessary (exercise or weddings etc) now I\u2019m 42 and my boobs are not nearly as low as my peers.
