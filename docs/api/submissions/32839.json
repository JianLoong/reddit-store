Our neighbors next door are a middle aged couple with at least two teenage/twenties kids and all four of them have a car.  They've lived next door to us for about four years and over the years we've had little interaction.  They do not park in their garage cause its full of boxes and prefer to park only one car in their driveway, leaving three more for the street.  \n\nIn the past, the only time I've spoken to them about parking was when I was out walking my dog and when someone else left the street parking space in front of my house the \"dad\" was hustling to move the car out of his driveway to take the street spot for himself.  I reminded him that we also have three cars and that it would be nice if he could share the parking.  Then we had no issues for at least a year or two as it seemed that their two kids moved out and my niece moved into her own place.\n\nEarlier this year, the \"mom\" decided to park her car on the street in front of her own house for the better part of the year and both kids returned with one of them only staying during the day and moving his car regularly but the other parked her car in front of my house for more than four months.  Having company in town and a storage box for a garage cleanout made parking tight with all of the other cars in the neighborhood, so I asked the HOA if they could do a courtesy reminder for the neighbors about the city ordinance requiring cars to move at least 1/10th of a mile every 72 hours.  I was told they could do nothing and that I needed to report parking issues to the city.  And so I did.\n\nSeveral more months go by and the two cars are still there, so in October I knocked on the neighbors' door and asked if they could please move one of their cars as it would be nice to park in front of my own house for a change.  They agreed and moved another car into the driveway and pulled their 3rd car in front of their own house.  I parked in front of mine and thought we were good.  Nope.\n\nEarlier this week, I guess the report I made in July/August finally got to the top of the parking authority's list and they left a warning on the neighbor's car that had returned to the street in front of my house where she had previously parked for most of the year.  Rather than read the warning and take her own behavior into consideration, this young woman decided to write a note to \"K@ren\" (word was scratched out and the title \"companors\" (sic) was written instead.  Her note:\n\n\"I moved my car, I am injured and have health issues that require parking close.

I don\u2019t think it got towed but she screamed at me about public parking. Ma\u2019am I thought it was abandoned.

Clearly, you feel entitled to the spot.", "ESH\n\nIt's public parking. It's not YOUR parking. It's a public street. You don't own it.\n\nTheir response is ridiculous. A restraining order because someone files a report about you parking illegaly?", "ESH\n\nIt is public parking, not designated (or else there would be recourse, if the parking places were actually assigned and someone parked in the spot assigned to another). The spot in front of your house is not \"your spot\" in the sense of it belonging to you or anyone else. It would be different if the parking was actually illegal, for example parking to block/partially block a driveway. OP seems to be way too invested in where other people are parking.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors are certainly not helping matters, and overreacting (restraining order? not likely to be granted, but threatening to seek one is rather over the top). They do have other options that would be less annoying to other neighbors, but other than not physically moving their car(s) as required by city ordinance, it does not appear that they are doing anything wrong with the parking on the street.", "Well ita public parking you can't so shit about it", "ESH. Sure, it\u2019s out of compliance, but is she making it so other people can\u2019t park? Is the street parking competitive? Why does it bother you so much where someone else parks?\n\nBut also.. these are your neighbors. Why make it more difficult by starting things like this? Minding your own business or maybe a civil discussion or note with her before going to the city is likely way more effective. Who wants to live by crappy neighbors?
