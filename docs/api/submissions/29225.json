I paid for everything, 3 course meal, snacks, wine etc. I spent roughly \u00a3150 per person on this evening.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nLast week my friend and her boyfriend of 1 year decided to have a bbq party at their place and they invited me. They told us to bring whatever they wanted to put on the grill. Later they changed their plans and said that they would buy the food we wanted, that we could just send the money later. I thought it was quite stingy as the amount they would spend on us wouldnt be more than \u00a315 each, ten times less than i did on them. However, i assumed that they were just short on money and I didnt mention anything.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nNow, day before the party they ask me to send them \u00a340. I was not expecting to be spending that much this evening for just a burger.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nTurns out, they had bought an entire dinner with dessert, starters and main meal without letting me or anybody else know. They also included decorations in this. We would still have to bring our own drinks as this was not included though...\r  \nNot only that, they just split the bill equally on everyone even though they, at the end of the night, would have so much left over.\r  \nThey even said that whatever is left they will just serve at their mothers birthday party a week later, which i was not invited to.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI was hesitant to bring this up before the party as I did not want to ruin the mood. However, i asked how they had split this money and that it did not seem quite fair, that it was quite a bit more than i was expecting to spend on this evening.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI then get a very angry message from my friends boyfriend, telling me that im being rude for questioning them. That im not a real friend for accusing them of lying about the bill (which i did not). I was also quite annoyed that the boyfriend, rather than my friend, was the one to tell me off.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI just told them that its fine, but in the future could we please agree on a budget before so that this doesnt happen again.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe day after the party, i get a text (again from the boyfriend) saying that they would like some space away from me. That questioning them about the money was very rude and they need some time to think about weither or not they want to be my friend anymore.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI felt very frustrated with this, especially considdering how much more i (and other people) spent have on them. Also because the boyfriend is the one saying all of this rather than my friend of 10+ years.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSo, i did lose it a bit and told them that theyre freeloaders. That theyre asking me to pay for their groceries, for the moms birthday party and for more than my share of this bbq. That, if they had any decency, wouldve paid for the bbq themselves considdering how often theyre treated by everyone else. Especially considdering its not even a 3rd of the amount i spent on them last time.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSo, AITA for going of on them like this and calling them freeloaders?", "created_utc": 1697712174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bg65c/aita_for_calling_my_friends_freeloaders/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Find friends that can pull their own weight financially.", "NTA.\n\nYour response was warranted.\n\nHowever, you have come to expect your friends to treat you the same as you treat them, especially in monetary terms. This isn't a bad thing. But when you volunteered to spend 150$ per person for an event, it should be noted that they didn't ask for it. You could have gone for a tighter budget. I realise this happened before the whole incident. But to be honest, you have shitty friends.\n\nI'm also wondering if anyone else brought this up, as the increase from 15$ to 40$ isn't negligible. \n\nLikewise, your friends' boyfriend is an ass. I'd have understood if your friend had come to speak with you, assuming you were close friends, since you knew each other for almost 10 years. But I feel like your friend avoided the confrontation by sending in their boyfriend. This assuming that your friend is in the known about their boyfriend's actions.\n\nThey have taken advantage of you and maybe others too. Ideally the leftover food should be divided by those present who paid for it. Not for some other unrelated event that you are not even a part of. Because, ultimately, you did pay for that food. \n\nIt may seem like a small thing, but this is how people tend to take advantage of you, today it could be for food, tomorrow it can be for other things. All because you trusted them to reciprocate in your time of need.\n\nHope your other friends realise what assholes this couple are and call them out on it.", "Nta and well rid", "NTA\n\nWhat an actual heck.\n\nNever in my life I was invited to a party where I have to pay for myself.\nI've been to many, with very varying budgets.

Nobody forced them to throw a party they cannot afford. And, btw, it has nothing to do with how much you spend on your parties.", "NTA.

You just called it as it is.\n\nBudget expectations should be discussed in future.

Also, it's so odd that they would say that you are accusing them of lying about the bill when you didn't mention anything of that sort.

Why would you donate money to people who want space?", "Look, I would very much like to give you N T A , but I feel you are in the wrong for constantly comparing your party to theirs. Your party and budget were all your decisions, the same as the invitation list. Nobody forced you to feed these people and I think it is kind of distasteful to keep the score like this. \n\nThat being said, they're honestly quite the AH for having such a big \"entry fee\" of sorts and not informing the guests about it beforehand. Some would maybe decline the invitation in such a case, which they should have the right to do. Also broadcasting about the leftovers being used at another party was lame considering the guest paid a big part of it at least. \n\nSo ESH I guess", "ESH - you may be wondering why but hear me out.\n\nThey suck, not because of asking for everyone to pay, but because the day before they raised it from 15 to an additional 45. That doesn\u2019t give anyone time to back out as needed. \n\nThe boyfriend in particular sucks because he\u2019s doing the communicating. I would definitely talk to your friend before throwing the relationship away if you care about it. If all communication is through the boyfriend your friend may be completely clueless about it. \n\nYTA because you *did* question about the money. Your choices are either to go and pay or to not go. Do I agree that they should have asked for money? No, but you decided to pay it. The \u201cwhy\u201d didn\u2019t matter. You either pay or you don\u2019t, but don\u2019t question everything as if it doesn\u2019t look worth it. \n\nYTA for your response after as well, you called them freeloaders after you got upset and revealed your true feelings which I\u2019m sure were apparent before you said it. No one likes to feel that they aren\u2019t doing their fair share (even if it\u2019s true) and yelling at them for it after the fact isn\u2019t worth it. At that point you should have just accepted that you don\u2019t want to be friends either and let them go. \n\nI will add, you called them freeloaders after only talking to the boyfriend. That\u2019s pretty harsh considering you didn\u2019t even clarify through your friend and a bit odd that you didn\u2019t reach out by phone call to see if she was ok.", "Look regardless of how you felt this was a reflection of how much is expected to be spent and in particular what you spent on your guests at your party, this wasn\u2019t your party and they are charging people 40 pounds each and if you don\u2019t like it then don\u2019t go and definitely don\u2019t keep banging on about how superior you and your party were.", "Info:\n\nHow did they respond to being called out?", "NTA. that bf is a freeloader. i would not associate with that firend as long as that AH is around", "Sent the money before the party already unfortunately.

Said this through text and did not get a response.

In the case of this, nothing. Saying \u201chey, this is a lot of food after we paid for it\u201d isn\u2019t productive because the food it purchased but talking to them about how you feel after being asked for money twice? Totally ok! \n\nAs a note, OP did not talk about how the additional cost hurt their budget or was out of reach. THAT would change the conversation. OP said how much they spend and how it wasn\u2019t a reach and that they just couldn\u2019t imagine spending that much \u201cfor burgers without drinks\u201d.\n\nHurting someone\u2019s feelings because you are upset with no real thing you want changes isn\u2019t ok. Having an honest conversation that results in hurt feelings and ends with a \u201cnext step\u201d or communication change is totally ok. In this case OP now knows that they don\u2019t pay. They\u2019ve been friends for 10 years and this has never come up? I doubt it.
