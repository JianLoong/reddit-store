{"id": 32742, "submission_id": "18f60mh", "title": "AITA for telling my cousins they didn't belong at my grandmother's funeral", "selftext": "My dad\u2019s side of our family is quite complicated. He doesn\u2019t speak to his brother anymore (they were about 20 y/o when they stopped talking), so I had never met my uncle and all of his children before the funeral.\n\nMy grandmother was a sweet little angel and my family (dad, mom and my sister) loved spending time with her. We went out with her every sunday evening to a restaurant and we loved spending evenings and christmas with her. My dad was the only one of my grandmother\u2019s children to take care of her and to spend time with her.\n\nMy grandmother passed away about 2 weeks ago, she was 95 years old and her health was impeccable, but in her last week of life, she had to go to the hospital and that\u2019s where she passed. My 4 cousins (I had never met them before the funeral), all of them are adults, never went to spend time with my grandmother, so I\u2019d say that hadn\u2019t seen her in more than 15 years (so they were children the last time they saw her). They never visited her in the hospital to say goodbye either while my family was there every single day to be with her and keep her company.\n\nNow comes her funeral. I didn\u2019t think they would show up. When they arrived, I didn\u2019t know who they were, so I thought they were coming to give us their condolences. But, at my horrible surprise, they came and stood beside me to accept other people\u2019s condolences. Something in me switched and I became enraged. I was mourning so my emotions were all over the place but I don\u2019t want to use that as an excuse because I think my feelings were somewhat understandable.\n\nIn my head, they didn\u2019t deserve to receive condolences because they never made any effort to see her all these years. If my family hadn\u2019t been there, my sweet grandma would have spent all of those christmas nights alone.\n\nWhen they started crying and telling people how hard it was and how sad they were, that\u2019s when i had to say something. I turned towards them and told them that the line was for family only, and that they didn\u2019t belong here. They told me they were family and that it was their grandmother too. I responded saying that family is supposed to be there for eachother, and they never were.\n\nAs to not ruin the funeral, I didn\u2019t scream, I told them while no one was listening, but now that all the emotions I was feeling in that moment passed, I just keep on wondering if I\u2019m the asshole in the situation\u2026 So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : to answer some questions, here's some clarification : \n\nMy father contacted each one of them to tell them that she was in the hospital and didn't have much time left if they wanted to come and say goodbye.\n\nWhen they were young, they had the chance to know her and they saw her quite frequently. They are now all over 30, so i just wanted to say that they had so many years to get in touch with her and to visit her. So, it wasn't because they couldn't, it was because they didn't make an effort. My dad's brother still spoke to my grandmother and they were quite close, so it's not because they couldn't.\n\nI just wanted to clarify that there were no falling out with my dad's brother and my grandmother. So they still saw each other occasionaly. Although, I know for a fact that my cousins never went to see her, because my grandma kept telling us how they missed them and hadn't seen them in so long.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702222195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f60mh/aita_for_telling_my_cousins_they_didnt_belong_at/", "score": 1407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here it is from a similar situation, from the other side.\n\nMy father endured a lot of physical and emotional abuse from his parents.  As Grandma got older, his siblings treasured and cared for her, because it wasn't them she had abused.  My father tried his best, but he was poor and they were not and-sorry Dad-she was just never going to love him.  Not my dad's fault.\n\nWe, his kids, were equally disliked.  So when it came time we were adults-of course we never went to see her!  She was awful to him and awful to us-the difference between our relationships with her and my cousins, uncles, etc, were night and day.\n\nBut of course when someone is like that, they don't go around telling people.  My cousins didn't know.  Of course we weren't close-why would we be? \n\nDid we still go to her funeral?  Of course! That's just what you do out of respect-even if she was abusive and hateful, she still gave my dad life.  Additionally, our extended family would've been upset and mad that we didn't even bother to show up because she was so sweet and loving with them-and yes, just like you, OP, some of them were mad we were there at all.  It didn't make a difference-no matter what we did, we couldn't please the extended family.\n\nNone of us were rude at the funeral or did anything hateful; and yeah, some of us did cry.  We cried because this woman should never have been so cruel or abusive, and in turn, her hatred formed my father into the person he became, and there was no chance now for resolution.  That's something to cry over.\n\nTLDR: You don't know your cousins at all.  You don't have a right or ownership over grief and you admitted you wouldn't know anything about their relationship with your grandmother.  It wasn't your business and was a hateful and unneccessary thing for you to do.", "You did ruin the funeral. You ruined the funeral for them, so therefore it is ruined. Period. So, yes, you ruined your grandmother's funeral. \n\nWould your grandmother have wanted you to do that? I doubt it. \n\nYou're convinced they were not there, but you don't know that. You don't know if there were letters exchanged. And you don't know how those few meetings with her impacted them. I only met one of my uncles once. He lived 1600 miles away and I was 13. But the one time he stayed with my grandpa for three days and I met him for the first time, was one of the most fondest memories of my childhood. And yes, I was sad when he passed. I'm actually tearing up writing this. \n\nSo you don't know.", "First, I'm sorry for your loss. Hopefully, you were able to make memories that you'll carry with you and cherish forever. \n\nBut, YTA.\n\n>As to not ruin the funeral,\n\nYou did, though. You told grieving family members that they didn't deserve to grieve. That will be what they remember from the funeral.\n\nYou don't know their circumstances, and you don't mention if they are physically close to where she was hospitalized. \n\nEveryone grieves different, and everyone's family interactions are different. Just because theirs were different from yours doesn't mean they are sad and grieving.", "YTA\n\nWhether or not you accept their relationship with your grandma, they are family, and you need to know how often they may or may not have contacted, called, sent cards, or whatever. Are you assuming they didn't see her at the hospital, or are you just assuming that because no one broadcast it?\n\nRegardless, gatekeeping a funeral is unacceptable, unless the guests are truly toxic, horrible people. You just don't believe your cousins \"deserve\" to have people tell them \"sorry for your loss\" and that's super petty.", "Soft YTA because you're grieving. Sorry for your loss.\n\nBut from experience, it's possible they were in touch with your grandmother & she didn't feel able to disclose that to avoid trouble.\n\nYou don't know what the truth is re the history of your cousins interactions with your grandmother. \n\nIt's also possible to grieve for the absence of something. They may be grieving because they didn't get to have the relationship they would have liked to have with her & that chance is now lost forever.\n\nI hope you can take comfort from the fact you got the chance to be there for your grandmother & she knew how much you loved her.", "YTA - I get it. I have cousins who didn\u2019t spend as much time with my grandmother as some of the rest of us. But you don\u2019t get to gate keep the grief of others. Additionally, if there was a falling out with the uncle and the kids were kept away they\u2019re probably feeling a lot of regret that they missed that time. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to like it. You may not think they deserved to be considered family. But they were still her family and you tried making it about you and your feelings.", "Um YTA. Just because they didn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t really) have a relationship with her, doesn\u2019t mean they cannot or shouldn\u2019t grieve for her. It\u2019s sad that they never got the chance to know her, which was outside of their control. Ffs.", "I remember my dad once complaining that my cousin never went over to see my grandmother, but he was the favorite son, while my grandmother treated my aunt poorly and did the same to her kids. She was far harsher on the women of the family than the men. If I had no relationship with my aunt and cousins, my only knowledge of my grandmother would be with the woman who was loving and generous with me. \n\nYou have no clue what their relationship with her was like or their circumstances for visiting her were. YTA.", "YTA.  First off, I'm sorry for your loss.  You're entitled to grieve your grandma.  But you're not entitled to police who else grieves for her.\n\nI promise you that families are complicated, that there are perspectives you aren't seeing, and that nothing is ever so simple as \"angel grandma, devil cousins.\"  Show them some grace, you may not know the whole picture here.", "YTA.  They are family, and they have a right to be there, and to grieve how they see fit.", "YTA. You admit you hadn't seen them in years, to the point where you didn't even recognize them. So you have no idea what their side of the story is. At the least, you don't have a right to be gatekeeping who should be at the funeral or who should be grieving or who should not. And, in public was not the place to be having that conversation, if at all.\n\nBut, face it - by being the one who made the scene, you were the one who ruined the funeral, because you were the one who took all the family's dirty laundry and aired it in front of *everyone* who came to the funeral. And, all the explanations and edits aside, that is all it comes down to.", "Yes, I\u2019m sorry. YTA\n\nIrrespective of how they interacted with your grandma (who sounds like a lovely person!) they are, in fact, related to her. So you can\u2019t gatekeep their grief any more than they should do the same for yours.", "YTA.  No matter what happened you can\u2019t gatekeep who gets to grieve.", "YTA. You don't get \"grief tokens\" based on how much time you spent with the deceased and you don't get to tell someone else how to react to a loss.", "Info: your title says you told them they did not belong at the funeral, but the body of the post makes it seem like you just felt they didn't belong in the recieving line. Which was it?", "Do you think your grandma would have wanted them at her funeral? Seems you're making this about your feelings instead of her", "YTA you don't have the right to act in that way in that situation", "Hate to say this but YTA.  While you get to treasure the memories you had with her, they are left grieving the moments they will never have to chance to get.  You also grieve the the missed opportunities, it doesn\u2019t make their pain and grief any less real than yours.", "yta and extended family who were briefed about the confrontation agree on that fact. you centered your own feelings and started a confrontation at a funeral. yikes.\n\nwhat do you lose from their grieving? why are petty thoughts in your mind while you're supposedly grieving/celebrating Gma? what were you hoping to gain from confronting your cousins?\n\nyou're coming off like, \"I've earned my grief,\" and that your cousins (and lots of other family members), who were physically unpresent, didn't. was spending time with Gma was such a chore?", "So I was in a fairly similar situation with my dad and his sister, except they still have an ok relationship.  My aunt and her family live 12 hours away by car.  They used to visit once or twice a year when their kids (10ish years older than me) were kids.  When I was in middle school my cousins started having kids and then my aunt and uncle would bring their grandkids, again once or twice a year but their kids (my first cousins) stopped coming unless it was for something big, like a milestone birthday for my grandma or my wedding.  As they got older, the grandkids stopped coming too.  I looked at my sister after my grandma\u2019s 95th birthday and said the next time we saw them would be Grandma\u2019s funeral.  My sister and I watched Grandma deteriorate and were with her for every holiday.  The cousins couldn\u2019t even bother to FaceTime to tell her goodbye.  We spoke at her funeral and supported our dad as best we could.  My cousins and their kids sobbed loudly but couldn\u2019t share one recent memory with Grandma.  It was ridiculous and their behavior was out of pocket.  We didn\u2019t say anything though because we didn\u2019t want to make things harder on my dad.  My deepest sympathies on the loss of your grandma.", "My dad had a great relationship with his mother, but I never had a great relationship with my dad. We saw her a few times a year when I was very young but that stopped a couple years after my parents divorced and my dad lost interest in his kids. I would have loved to know my grandma but my dad always kept me at arms length and seemed like he didn\u2019t really want me to come around, and I very much hate being where I\u2019m not wanted. I don\u2019t know how my cousins perceived my absence over the years, but I went to my grandma\u2019s funeral and was genuinely heartbroken that I would never be able to know her. If one of my cousins had treated me the way you treated your cousins it would have been pretty devastating for me. YTA. You don\u2019t know people\u2019s stories and feelings.", "INFO: did they even know she was in the hospital?", "ESH. Because your father and his brother stopped talking when they were 20 your grandmother and your uncle\u2019s children were denied a proper relationship. Are you sure they were never in touch with their grandmother? Maybe your grandmother kept that under her hat, so it\u2019s not too upset your father? Granted, once your cousins became adults they could have reached out, but seriously, look at how immature you are. Did you really expect them to reach out when when it was clear they were not welcome as part of the family for all these years. You had an opportunity here to heal the family, and you simply chose to make it worse. Shame on you.", "YTA-It's not a grief competition jfc", "Yta for making the funeral all about you. You don't have a right to police your grandmothers funeral. It was not the time or place to act out the way you did. Maybe your cousins didn't visit often. Doesn't mean they didn't love your grandma or grieve for her", "You ruined your owns grandma funeral. Hope it was worth it.", "Your edit doesn\u2019t make things any better.  You\u2019re still ignoring the fact that you don\u2019t know their circumstances.  Maybe they couldn\u2019t afford to visit her often?  Maybe they called her several times a week?  Wrote letters?  But even if they didn\u2019t, they\u2019re still family and they still get to grieve.  My grandpa just passed and even though I have no contact with that family I was still sad and grieved for a few days.  You\u2019re a major AH in this OP and you need to apologize to them because you ruined the funeral.", "You don\u2019t know what happened in their life between your grandma and her other kids,  her and the other grandkids. \n\nShe was still their parent, and grandparent.  They have the right to grieve at her funeral if they aren\u2019t there to  hurt anyone.\n YTA.", "YTA\n\nThis resonates with me, because I was, more or less, in the same position as your cousins.\n\nI hadn\u2019t seen my lovely aunt in many years, mainly because of my own bad health - I couldn\u2019t walk - and then not being able to take the day it took to visit her as I was mum\u2019s carer as she didn\u2019t have use of her hands, slight dementia and was in a wheelchair. We talked occasionally on the phone.\n\nMy aunt was amazing to us when I was much younger and I wanted to pay my respects when she died, so I felt that I had to pay my respects.\n\nWe managed to get there, (very expensive wheelchair taxi journey)and some of her relatives in the other side of the family asked who we were -  they vaguely remembered us, but there was definitely a vibe of \u201cwhy did you bother to show up now?\u201d Because I couldn\u2019t walk, you turnips!\n\nYou know what. F them. I was at the funeral for her, not them.\n\nI would have visited her if I could, but life got in the way.

Just because you feel hurt that they were not present for your grandmother doesn\u2019t make them not family. \nAsk yourself, would my grandma have liked this? \nI can almost bet that she most certainly wouldn\u2019t want her grandchildren being rude at her funeral. \nI know you\u2019re hurting but telling your cousins that they are shit won\u2019t help you with your grief. \nHope you find peace in your heart through this hardship.", "YTA, a huge one.

Maybe they were just self-absorbed, clueless idiots.  Nonetheless, they showed-up, to pay their respects, and when one gives condolences, one gives them to the family.  Not individual members of the family.  \n\n\nIf your grandmother missed your cousins and wanted to see them, she'd likely want them at her funeral, no?  Instead, you were jealous and vindictive, and lashed out at them, regarding an issue that should've remained between them and your grandmother, *not* them and yourself.  If it was up to anyone to judge them for their absence, it was up to *her*.  Not you.", "Losing someone you love is hard. \nYTA & a huge one at that.

I bawled my eyes out in my car after leaving my dad\u2019s house the day after he died. Why? Because everyone was so concerned about my half-brother\u2019s feelings no one noticed I was drowning in grief as well.  Even at my father\u2019s celebration of life my half-brothers and I were 3 separate people grieving a different man.

He doesn\u2019t speak to his brother anymore (they were about 20 y/o when they stopped talking), so I had never met my uncle and all of his children before the funeral.\r  \n\r  \nMy grandmother was a sweet little angel and my family (dad, mom and my sister) loved spending time with her. We went out with her every sunday evening to a restaurant and we loved spending evenings and christmas with her. My dad was the only one of my grandmother\u2019s children to take care of her and to spend time with her. \r  \n\r  \nMy grandmother passed away about 2 weeks ago, she was 95 years old and her health was impeccable, but in her last week of life, she had to go to the hospital and that\u2019s where she passed. My 4 cousins (I had never met them before the funeral), all of them are adults, never went to spend time with my grandmother, so I\u2019d say that hadn\u2019t seen her in more than 15 years (so they were children the last time they saw her). They never visited her in the hospital to say goodbye either while my family was there every single day to be with her and keep her company. \r  \n\r  \nNow comes her funeral. I didn\u2019t think they would show up. When they arrived, I didn\u2019t know who they were, so I thought they were coming to give us their condolences. But, at my horrible surprise, they came and stood beside me to accept other people\u2019s condolences. Something in me switched and I became enraged. I was mourning so my emotions were all over the place but I don\u2019t want to use that as an excuse because I think my feelings were somewhat understandable.\r  \n\r  \nIn my head, they didn\u2019t deserve to receive condolences because they never made any effort to see her all these years. If my family hadn\u2019t been there, my sweet grandma would have spent all of those christmas nights alone. \r  \n\r  \nWhen they started crying and telling people how hard it was and how sad they were, that\u2019s when i had to say something. I turned towards them and told them that the line was for family only, and that they didn\u2019t belong here. They told me they were family and that it was their grandmother too. I responded saying that family is supposed to be there for eachother, and they never were. \r  \n\r  \nAs to not ruin the funeral, I didn\u2019t scream, I told them while no one was listening, but now that all the emotions I was feeling in that moment passed, I just keep on wondering if I\u2019m the asshole in the situation\u2026 So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But you tried to start a fight at a funeral, so yes, yta here.", "YTA. They stood there and cried and you made them feel worse. If you're questioning your decision here you already know the answer. Seeing as funerals are actually for the living if you want to have any relationship with these people for the next 50ish years I would apologize, maybe that's even a way to start talking with them. You don't have to keep someone else's grudge.", "YTA. First off, I am so sorry for your loss. My thoughts go out to you, as do my prayers if you want them to (i know some people don\u2019t like having others pray for them). However, you don\u2019t know 100% what your cousins\u2019 relationship with their grandmother was. As children they were prevented from seeing her, and that\u2019s going to change the dynamic. Even if they didn\u2019t know her as adults, they knew her as children and probably loved her. They are family, whether you like it or not, and they deserve to grieve just as you do. \n\nI understand your anger. Someone you love died, and it\u2019s a natural reaction to lash out at people sometimes. But that doesn\u2019t make it right or okay. You owe your cousins an apology.", "Families are complicated.

She did a lot of what I feel is performative grieving for my mother and while it irritated me, it wasn't my place to say anything. Partly because my mom wouldn't have wanted to, and partly because I dont get to dictate her grief. Her relationship with my mom isn't my relationship with her. Your cousins relationship isn't your relationship and the fact is, your grandmother would probably not want something like that happening at her funeral.

We had driven through a blizzard from Maryland to Connecticut to be there.  I later realized that she was confusing me with my mother.  It was very strange having this old woman shaking her finger at me obviously very pissed off.\n\nMy point is that we are not privy to the history of various relationships.  Even if there has not been contact for decades, the person could be grieving the separation itself.  Hope of reconciliation is no longer possible and the permanence of death is a lot to handle.\n\nSoft YTA.", "I\u2019m not sure this isn\u2019t a short story creative writing exercise.

In all honesty you don't know their relationship with your grandma. Maybe they did call her or visit her, just outside of your awareness or less frequently than your grandma would've preferred. You didn't even know who they were, how can you presume to know how they were feeling or what their relationships with your grandma were? This may have been an opportunity for some family reconciliation, but you nipped that right in the bud. She's their grandma, they had every right to attend the funeral and stand in line for condolences, you had no right to tell them to leave.", "My grandmother passed away with me and one of my aunts with her. She had 12 kids. 42 grandkids. Some of her kids she had not seen or heard from in years. Some of her grandkids she had not seen since they were babies. My grandmother was a smart lady and knew who loved her and who would show up to see what they could get. She left me in charge with a list of who had gave her what during her life. Each person was to get only what they had gave her back. That aunt that was with me got the most, my mom the next most and so on. 90% didn't get anything at all. They did the most crying at the funeral funny enough.", "Sorry, but yes, YTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide what relatives are worthy of being there. It\u2019s really that simple.", "Soft YTA, the funeral wasn\u2019t the place to to voice it but understand the bitterness you feel because I felt it at my own grandmother\u2019s funeral. One cousin was in town at least once every month but never bothered to stop by to say hi. A different cousin used her as a babysitter for her sick kids (she died not long after that because she caught what the kids had). Then there was the one who literally lived next door. My aunt who lived with her has health issues of her own and often had week long hospital stays. I didn\u2019t mind staying with my grandmother despite her (at the time) living 30 mins or so away. What bothered me was I had to since family that lived right next to her couldn\u2019t be bothered to do so themselves.\n                         \nAt the funeral they talked about how much they loved her and were going to miss her. The worst one at the moment was my one of my grandmother\u2019s own sisters. She didn\u2019t visit my grandma while she was in the hospital or hospice, she instead went shopping with her sister in law. At the funeral she came in crying with a rose she wanted to place in the casket then got upset it was closed and that the funeral was short. That is what my grandmother wanted however. She didn\u2019t want people staring at her and she didn\u2019t want a long and drawn out funeral. Something her sister complained about.\n\nSo I do understand feeling bitter, angry, and almost protective of your grandmother\u2019s memory, but once more the funeral wasn\u2019t the place to voice that. Even if your cousins weren\u2019t as close they could likely still be sad about her death and are mourning her. Also maybe not, but a different time and place should have been chosen to voice that, if at all. It\u2019s been 9 years since my grandmother died and I still haven\u2019t mentioned how bitter I felt to anyone other than my own parents and siblings.", "I\u2019m so glad that my family welcomed me back when my grandmother died.

YTA.", "The cousins didn't make an effort to visit your grandma at all, so you're NTA, OP. I had one cousin who was in the military and he wasn't able to visit my father when he was about to pass from cancer, but he still wanted to be there. My other cousin, who's a girl, was never there. Never visited my family and never paid any mind to what was going on. My aunt and uncle, on the other hand, did visit. It was still a hit to the heart when my cousin wanted condolences for my father when she never truly cared much for my dad and I'm glad we didn't have a funeral for him. I get where you're coming from, OP. Your cousins are the AHs.", "Ehhh how do you know? They could have visited her when you weren\u2019t around? Did your grandmother specifically tell you they didn\u2019t visit or did you just assume they didn\u2019t visit because they weren\u2019t there visiting when you were? Also it\u2019s still their family they can be upset someone died and yes they should have condolences because that\u2019s a family memenber of theirs. You don\u2019t know everything that happened behind closed doors so I feel like this was not the time to have that conversation.", "Yta\u2026yikes why are you trying to gate keep at a funeral?

I still went to her funeral, and no one on that side of the family tried to keep me away.", "Where are you getting that grandma was abusive?", "To make it worse, OP saw that they were sad and grieving and got mad about it and just had to say something to ruin their day even further.  OP is a major AH in this.", "This is the perfect response. Even with OP\u2019s edit, we don\u2019t truly know the circumstances of the cousins\u2019 relationship(s) to grandma.

That was some stranger\u2019s funeral", "were they actually grieving? seems more to me they were just attention seeking.", "Sorry, this isn't a soft YTA, it's a Massive YTA. OP doesn't know what's going on at all.  OP has no right to tell them how they  shouldn't be able to grieve. She ruined her grandmas funeral by starting drama over a situation she has no idea what was going on or the situation with the cousins and made an ass of themselves by trying to dictate/ gatekeep who can or had The right to grieve.", "Adding to this, it\u2019s entirely possible the cousins did have a relationship with their grandmother, and OP just didn\u2019t know about it because of the estrangement between OP\u2019s dad and uncle.", "Hi! I completly understand where you're coming from. I just wanted to say that when they were young, they had the chance to know her and they saw her quite frequently. They are now all over 30, so i just wanted to say that they had so many years to get in touch with her and to visit her. So, it wasn't because they couldn't, it was because they didn't make an effort. My dad's brother still spoke to my grandmother and they were quite close, so it's not because they couldn't. But I completely accept your response, thank you.", "Excellent question. Did anyone even contact them?", "Plus did they even know she was in the hospital?", "Yeah for a min i thought i was the only one on OPs side.", "OP has literally zero idea of the relationship her cousins had with Grandma, she admits as much; she guestimates 14 years because grandma would sometimes complain she hadn't seen them in a while, but offers no proof, and ignores that other means of communication - letters, phonecalls, etc. - could have been incredibly frequent and still left the grandmother with 'haven't SEEN them' as a take-away, especially as older adults *often* have difficulties with remembering when they last talked to someone", "Yeah in this case op.", "They aren\u2019t. This comment is about their own family and just an example that op might have had no idea what was actually going on.", "The comment does not say Grandma was abusive.

Sometimes the truth is somewhere in the middle and the two parties just can't see that they have perspectives, but the truth is the truth.

I just wanted to clarify that there were no falling out with my dad's brother and my grandmother. So they still saw each other occasionaly. Although, I know for a fact that my cousins never went to see her, because she kept telling us how they missed them and hadn't seen them in so long.", "Just because you aren't aware of it, doesn't mean they didn't make an effort. As for the funeral maybe they wish they had spent more time with her. You don't get to gatekeep how other people grieve.", "I wonder how your sweet little angel grandmother would have felt about you making a scene at her funeral in a bid to play grief Olympics with your cousins. The point is that she loved them and they loved her and they had as much right to be there to mourn their loss - in whatever capacity that may have meant for them. I get that you\u2019re hurting deeply, but that doesn\u2019t give you carte blanche to hurt others and cause more strife. Make no mistake: you absolutely ruined her funeral.", "My condolences on your loss. Everyone grieves in their own way. Apparently your way to grieve is to dictate who is allowed to show grief or closeness to your grandmother. Your grief is being expressed by putting a fence around family members who spent their last days with your grandmother, as opposed to family members who spent their earlier days with her. This is your grief.\n\nHowever, your other family members are entitled to their grief too. So your older cousins haven't physically seen your grandmother in her later years. Has that taken away the importance of the time they spent with her, or her importance as an influential relative in their upbringing? People go to funerals to celebrate and grieve a person's life\u2014the entirety of it. They don't just pay attention to the last few years of a life. It's excellent that you, and your family, were there for your grandmother at the end. But you'll understand as you get older that a lifetime spans multiple decades, with multiple relationships, with multiple mini-lives during these decades. I didn't get to see my grandmother much regularly either, not like my cousins got to. I didn't live in the same state as they did with my gran. But I talked on the phone with her regularly, which even my own family didn't know about until after she died. You never know what a person's relationships are. This is why YTA.", "I support you. Your grandmother was well aware of who had always been there for her. You have a right to your opinion and you were not dictating how someone grieves.

My mom comes from a rather small family. She\u2019s the middle of three, but only her older sibling has kids, so there are only four of us in my generation. My aunt (who married into the family, mind you), used to complain all the time that my grandma never talked to her about her own kids, but always talked about me (I\u2019m an only child). Well, we only ever heard about the other three kids. \n\nThe difference? My mom and I understood that we would always hear about them (WHY would we hear about what we already know?), but my aunt was VERY jealous about grandma never talking to her about her OWN kids!", "now you are guessing and guessing wrong. OP said that they never visited the grandma. Read the post again.", "So what you are saying is your grandma loved them and would have been happy they showed up to mourn her.", "Sometimes old people exaggerate how nobody ever visits, because they're lonely. It's very reasonable. If you visited every week and the cousins every month, she might feel as though she hasn't seen them in so long, but they feel a strong attachment.", "Before my grandmother died she once told my mother she hadn't seen her for such a long time - my mum had gone to the car but to my nan it had been months", "Not visiting as often as you doesn't mean they didn't.", "My mother is 80 and recovering from surgery.

I lived in a different state and had obligations that made travel difficult. But I spoke to them by phone and sent cards and letters. They still said they wished they saw me more often. Because they did! I did too! But seeing someone isn\u2019t the only way to connect with them. They have memories of your grandmother. They loved her and they mourn her.

She would legit forget that we had just talked.", "Yes, my grandma does this. She will say she has not heard from or seen me when I had seen or talked to her recently. I got a text once from a family member cursing me out for not contacting my grandma recently, when I had just called her less than a week before and talked to her for over an hour and a couple weeks prior to that I was at her house for hours. \n\nI don't blame my grandma because I think somehow time measures differently, or she just forgets when something happens. She also tells me when I see her that so and so hasn't been around or talked to her in forever. I think most of my family knows now that this is just something that happens.", "This sounds like a golden child/scapegoat situation with the brothers.\n\nYou do not know the minutiae of the relationships enough to understand the disparity in them. Talk to your uncle and ask what his view is because you want to understand. And then you freaking listen for the sake of receiving information, NOT for the sake of forming responses. \n\nIt is entirely possible that your perspective is missing some missing reasons, and you only got your dad's idea of what happened. So, be prepared to hear things you do not like, vary from what you've been told, or are surprising. \n\nBut hold your words back until you can pricess the new knowledge. The cousins absolutely did deserve to be there and you should own up to them that YTA.", "A few points to make here but YTA!

My grandma was my bestie. My dad, on the other hand, was not particularly close with his parents and they lived an hour away. We saw them maybe twice a year for the holidays, and that was it. I always enjoyed spending time with them, but we just didn't have a close bond. I was still legitimately sad when my grandpa died.

I have first and second cousins I havent seen in years because they live far away. My grandma was their grandma too! Your grandmother was still their family.  Get over yourself!

If this was in the US, I can say that the social norm at a funeral is for family to be in the receiving line, so maybe that's all they were doing. Or they could have been attention seeking and just putting on a show, but because you don't really know anything about their relationship with her you can't assume that.

That was something private between each one of them and her. \n\nYou need to acknowledge how wrong it was of you to try to publicly shame them at their grandmother\u2019s funeral. \n\nYou need to tell them that it would have made her happy that they came despite any distance there may have been between them (because that is most likely true). \n\nThey probably will never be interested in a relationship with you now, but asking if they may want any pictures you may find of her and of her and them or some type of memento of your grandmothers to remember her by. \n\nPick out things that just scream your grandma, like for instance my grandmother would wear the most outlandish costume jewelry. \n\nShe even wore a necklace she made with stickers and paper clips.

I am not exactly sure why that is. \n\nMy guess is that they are afraid of admitting that what they did was wrong will make others judge and think badly of them.

They are literally her grandchildren. They \"qualify\" to stand in a receiving line and they don't need to be kicked out by someone who admits they know absolutely nothing about them. You also won't say how far they live from your grandmother. Sounds like you live up the street and it was not difficult for you to get to see her. I have cousins who didn't get to know my grandmother as well as I did because they lived far away and just never had as close a relationship. They cried at her funeral. They wished things had been different. In my wildest dreams i couldn't have imagined shoving their noses in it in that moment.\n\nYou don't know who they are, what else has been going on in their lives, what their finances are, what their health/mental health is like, what other obligations they have, whether they kept in touch in some other way, what their encounters were like with her as kids (which likely are meaningful to them even if you, a stranger, doesn't think they put in the hours to...attend a funeral as her grandchildren?) What would your grandmother think of how you treated her other grandkids that based on all you've said she also loved? Would she be like \"Hell yeah, they came to mourn me and pay tribute and OP disciplined them and showed them their place in the pecking order. What a celebration of my life!\" Doubtful\n\nCan't tell how old you are but i can tell you're not very.  I'm guessing your actions will come back to you in the future when someone behaves poorly toward you based on a pile of assumptions and judgements  YTA", "I am in your families situation. As a child I was closer to my grandmother on my maternal side. She lived 5 hours from me and my family would frequently go down there, but my parents can be really difficult and basically hate each other's families. My mom's side hates my dad and my dad's family, and vice versa, so I grew up disconnected from my entire mom's side (6-7 siblings all with kids) and my dad's side is small, he has two siblings only one has kids, which I didn't really see them often either.\n\nMy paternal grandmother turned me against my maternal family, saying they're nasty people, they turned my mom away when I was a newborn etc. i kept my distance when they tried to come back (mom's side). My maternal grandmother is now sick in a home and after 10+ years I went to visit her for the sake of my mother and seeing her after all these years now I'm 31, bmit brought back a flood of memories from my childhood, a ton of sadness, I couldn't keep my heart cold. Watching her cry at seeing me, saying how much I remind her of my mom, how God has given her a miracle that I was there, it was a sign for her. She never held malice and going through my stages of life as a tren, young adult and still young adult but more mature, I realize the way I think has changed, become less hard, less angsty for lack of better words.\n\nI've wrestled with ostracizing myself for this or forgiving myself and allowing me to accept happiness and family with open arms rather than continue down the path of closed doors. \n\nI think soft YTA but I'm not in much of a position to judge this.", "You are definitely NTA. If they actually cared, there would have been some kind of contact. The simple truth is that they did not care.", "It\u2019s not about attending it\u2019s about jumping in the line to receive condolences for someone they never bothered to visit. THAT should be reserved for the close family. Them talking about how much they\u2019ll miss her is pretending they spent a ton of time with her when per OP, they\u2019ve hardly seen her in years. OP is NTA, the shitty family members are.", "I'd like to join you guys here.", "Nope. They knew she wasn\u2019t well and was dying, it wasn\u2019t hard for them to show up at least once. The edit says they were informed about her condition. They didn\u2019t even bother to speak with her on the phone.", "Nope, the edit clarifies that. They knew she wasn\u2019t well and didn\u2019t even bother to speak to her on the phone.", "Sounds Ike you are projecting here. You don't know them and have no idea how they were feeling.", "or we don't police others grief.", "You have no idea what their relationship was like.  If they lived far away they might\u2019ve not been able to afford to make it.  It\u2019s easier to believe that they\u2019re sad than to believe that they were faking.", "You are not the gatekeeper of the family.", "My grandma once told me she hadn't seen my cousin in months, and I was like \"grandma he called me from yours last week and I spoke to both of you.\"\n\nI think some old people experience the passing of time very differently to the rest of us, plus they get forgetful.\n\n>she was saying she was all alone while I heard my little cousins screaming on the background\n\nThis is hilarious though.", "I help care for my elderly aunt and when I showed up on Thursday night she said she didn't know I was coming because I hadn't talked to her all week. I'd slept at her house Sunday night and talked to her twice on Monday, twice on Tuesday, and once each on Wednesday and Thursday. No idea what she's telling other family members about me.", "My attempt at translating:\n\n\u201cExactly, I (22yo) live with my grandma, my cousins (23 and 19) live across the street and visit her often and call her all the time and still she always says that we almost never visit and it surprises us.

Saying she shouldn't sit with the family. \nMy mom got her to sit in the front row while the family was in a separate section to the right. I sat with my mom and BFFs mom during the service. \nI haven't spoken to my BFFs mom since the funeral 5 years ago.", "The cousins were her grandchildren, they were her closest relatives, they have as much of right as OP to stand.", "Yeah... there's a *big* difference between just going to a funeral service and going to stand in the receiving line.\n\nIf what you've said is true, OP, then NTA.", "And OP neglected to tell us how far away they live (guessing Op doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019ve never met them)", "Wait, if there was no falling out between grandma and uncle, what makes you think the cousins were estranged from her? They probably were very much a part of her life, you just didn't see it. You were very misinformed and ruined your grandma's funeral because of it.", "I hadn't seen my grandmother in 10 years when she passed but I did talk with her on the phone.  I drove 22 hours in 2021 to her funeral.  My family welcomed my presence.  They didn't gatekeep grief", "I have a question. \n\nDid your grandmother ever ask your uncle to give her your cousins' contact information? \n\nMy thoughts are that if there was no falling out between your grandmother and your uncle, and your uncle and your grandmother still saw each other occasionally, then did your grandmother ever say to your uncle, \"Hey, son, it's been awhile since I've seen your children. Could you please give them my phone number and tell them to call me? Or give me their contact information so that I can call them.\"?\n\nI get that (according to you) your uncle's kids never reached out to your grandmother, and that they didn't ever visit her, but relationships work both ways. Your grandmother could have reached out to your cousins and initiated a relationship with them, instead of sitting on her ass and expecting them to come to her.", "Linda, yo vivo con mi abuela, como las tres comidas con ella, vemos pel\u00edculas los fines de semana y a\u00fan as\u00ed cuando vienen mis primos les dice que nunca me ve por la Universidad y que me extra\u00f1a. Porque para los abuelos el tiempo con nosotros nunca es suficiente.

I know the impact these people had on her life and I'd love to know she impacted them too and that she's missed by more than just immediate family and the few friends she is seeing regularly at the end.\n\nId love nothing more than a packed room celebrating her and telling us all stories about her that we've never heard. My greatest worry is that this won't happen and it'll just be us kids grieving.", "Sorry the rest is in Spanish but as you can see the translator I use is not very good\n\nQue OP no lo viera pasar, no significa que no pas\u00f3. Que ella nunca los haya visto llamarlos, no significa que ellos nunca llamaron. Que ellos nunca hayan ido al hospital no significa que no les preocupaba, o que no le hayan preguntado a su pap\u00e1. La pandemia dejo muy malas experiencias sobre hospitales a la poblaci\u00f3n mundial.", "Thank you! I just wrote a comment that was probably a little too wordy to get my point across but I think NTA too, because this is just wild to me that they think they\u2019re allowed in the receiving line when they had no relation besides blood to the grandma whatsoever.", "Speaking on the phone and physically visiting are 2 different things. Also as others have said maybe they did talk to her on the phone and OP just didn't know. If she was only in there for a week as well maybe they thought they had time to call her.
