If not, I would say that whilst your request is definitely fair and appropriate, your phrasing was as rude as her telling you things rather than requesting.", "NTA.  You can be a good niece and love your aunt and still set the expectation for respect.  Is that how she talks to her friends?  Stand that ground!", "NTA but you are being a bit petty. How difficult would it be to say \"Aunt, it would mean a lot to me if you asked me instead of demanded of me that we do certain activities. It feels disrespectful, and I hope you don't intend it that way.\" \n\nStill setting a boundary for yourself without putting her on the defensive.", "In reddit-world, it's fine.\n\nIn the real world, it seems antagonistic, if she was otherwise being pleasant, then I don't see what the harm would be in being pleasant back.\n\nOn reddit, any small mistake, you can say whatever you like back to someone, no problem.\n\nIn the real world, each party of a conversation/disagreement should be making the effort to be polite and pleasant.\n\nI'm going ESH, but you'll otherwise get all N T As.", "NTA Your family won\u2019t pay a bit of attention to a diplomatic request to respect your time and boundaries.

You couldn't have told her that you would be grateful if she could ask rather than assume, and be understanding of your independence, whilst still being courteous and respectful?", "ESH. I certainly understand your frustration but you get more bees with honey than vinegar.

Your aunt's explosive reaction suggests it wasn't about bluntness,though. It sounds to me that she reacted to the change in the power dynamic.", "What are these comments? I think your response was fine. She has no right to make demands of a 28-year-old adult like that\n\nNTA", "NTA you are right you ate 28 and not at her back and call. Using having helped you is throwing it in your face and very manipulative.", "NTA OP.  Your aunt seems to like stomping on your boundaries, so your attitude is warranted.", "NTA. Even if you hadn't had the prior discussions, which you did, family needs to adjust to the fact that you are an adult.\n\nMy version of this fight with my mother was to just keep asking her how old I was and when she responded that she wouldn't be spoken to that way I informed her that the same was true for me.

Perhaps that\u2019s worth the energy of actually discussing with her before snapping at her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t choose to parent you, she had to pick up the burden so you could survive. It\u2019s not if any of us are born parents or nurturers, we have to learn it. So ask your therapist how to have a conversation about boundaries with her.", "NTA. Your aunt sounds like a narcissist. This is the same type of shit my mom would do. People telling you to \"handle it better\" or \"phrase it nicely \" don't know what it's like to be raised by a narcissist (check out the sub for sad but relatable stories like these). Those same comments are the coddling behaviors narcissists expect from everyone. \n\nNTA NTA NTA", "YTA for the way you handled it. You had this realization from therapy and you should have talked to your aunt about it not make a childish remark like you did. It's OK to have boundaries but you need to have adult conversations about them.\nYou should also realize that even if she phrases it as a command you can still treat as a question and say no. I don't think her way if communicating is that uncommon, especially in a child/parent like situation.", "You are NTA in any way here, your aunt is crossing your boundries and assuming a victim role when called out on it, which is a form of maipulation. Good for you for setting and enforcing your boundaries!", "People with unreasonable expectations and a lack of boundaries will not respond positively to boundaries you put into place. Hang in there. She will either come to respect them or not.", "NTA but might be better to have explained how you felt before going for the bluntness. In saying that though, I would have done exactly the same so should probably take my own advice!\n\nIt's hard to transition out of those adult child mindsets", "I don\u2019t understand why you are hung up on her asking. I know people who do this too; I just say no if I don\u2019t want to go. Eg \u201cYou are driving me to the airport tomorrow\u201d. Me: \u201cAm I? You forgot to ask me if I\u2019m available and unfortunately I can\u2019t\u201d\n\nThis approach avoids a power struggle, isn\u2019t rude/treat the other person as if they are your child and still draws a boundary where needed. \n\nIsn\u2019t a boundary needed every time?

With that in mind, you need to discuss this face to face, not when a demand has been issued to you by text and your blood is up. \n\nShe needs to hear that although you\u2019re very grateful for everything she did for you, you aren\u2019t a child anymore, you aren\u2019t able to be available at short notice, and that you have other demands on your time that can\u2019t always be shifted.\n\nThere is no guarantee she will take it well. It sounds like she perceives you owe her a debt for what she did (\u201cingrate\u201d). Be clear to her - you were a child who didn\u2019t ask for her help (though you\u2019ll always be grateful for it) - what she gave you was a gift, not a loan with interest. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, despite the history, you may need to let her know you\u2019ll be pulling back from your relationship with her until she is able to respect your position. \n\nYou are not her property and you are not her servant.

But I\u2019m 28 years old and I do not appreciate being summoned like a child. If you\u2019d like me to be involved in something, *ask*.

She doesn't seem to perceive you as an equal adult, to be treated with respect, am I right?  I guess that she see you as a child, ready to fall in with her demands.\n\nIf you actually want he to respect you, you may need to take a different approach, as the blunt approach does not work for her.\n\nI would suggest that for the next 3 to 4 weeks, whenever she co-opts you to something, say no.  Not *just* no, but something along the lines of \"No, I will not be able to meet you at noon.  I am working / I made plans already\". \nOr \"No, I cannot take that day off at short notice, I need x days notice\" - what you want to convey here is (1) you have your own plans and your commitments to other people, and (2) you cannot drop things at last minute.   Start with getting this established. \n\nSecondly.  Try modelling for your aunt the behavior you would like her to use.
