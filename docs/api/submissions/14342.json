Maybe Saturday instead?  Miss you!\"  (or whatever is \"you.\").", "Eh, could you have handled it better? Probably. Started with a conversation about \"I like spending time with you, but I'm not a child you can just schedule things for anymore. If you want us to do something together, you're always more than welcome to ask, but I need you to stop assuming you can just tell me what to do and when.\"\n\nBut considering how she reacted, it might or might not have helped all that much, so I'll go with NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't accept this behaviour from anyone. When people tell me what I am doing, I tell them to get lost. She's not making plans with you like a sane person would, but is making demands of you.", "NTA my response, perhaps a tiny bit more tactful, is usually 'are you asking me, or telling me?'", "INFO Have you ever addressed this with your Aunt in a more constructive matter?  If not, I would say that whilst your request is definitely fair and appropriate, your phrasing was as rude as her telling you things rather than requesting.", "NTA.  You can be a good niece and love your aunt and still set the expectation for respect.  Is that how she talks to her friends?  Stand that ground!", "NTA but you are being a bit petty. How difficult would it be to say \"Aunt, it would mean a lot to me if you asked me instead of demanded of me that we do certain activities. It feels disrespectful, and I hope you don't intend it that way.\" \n\nStill setting a boundary for yourself without putting her on the defensive.", "In reddit-world, it's fine.\n\nIn the real world, it seems antagonistic, if she was otherwise being pleasant, then I don't see what the harm would be in being pleasant back.\n\nOn reddit, any small mistake, you can say whatever you like back to someone, no problem.\n\nIn the real world, each party of a conversation/disagreement should be making the effort to be polite and pleasant.\n\nI'm going ESH, but you'll otherwise get all N T As.", "NTA Your family won\u2019t pay a bit of attention to a diplomatic request to respect your time and boundaries. Don\u2019t back down.", "INFO are the shoe shipping and auction to buy things for you?  Because if so yes she should phrase better, but I think your reply could have been more measured", "YTA for how you handled it, but not for your desire for her to respect your independence.\n\nShe has gone above and beyond for you, way way way above and beyond. That doesn't give her rights to run your life or schedule but it should earn her some respect and courtesy in how you talk to her.\n\nWere you for some reason incapable of politely explaining that sometimes you have other plans, and whilst you enjoy spending time with her, you can't always do so every time she wants???? You couldn't have told her that you would be grateful if she could ask rather than assume, and be understanding of your independence, whilst still being courteous and respectful?", "ESH. I certainly understand your frustration but you get more bees with honey than vinegar. Now that said, what is manifesting as a boundaries issue is more because your aunt doesn\u2019t emotionally realize you aren\u2019t the same vulnerable child she gladly helped out. \n\nDon\u2019t yell or scream or blame game.
