But also as someone who has had similar experiences in my own family, I really want to share some stuff you are free to consider or not.\n\nI understand the whole treat with the same level of regard/respect being given thing. You don't want to waste your time and energy on someone who isn't going to respect you. Understandable. \n\nBut, applied to people in your life that you either want to keep around or have to keep around (such as someone you're dependent on for housing or just can't go NC with for whatever reason) this kind of thing can easily devolve into tit for tat nastiness that just never gets resolved or better. I think it would be important to decide what kind of relationship you ultimately want to maintain or not maintain with her and act accordingly. \n\nEx: if you want to be on good terms and have her in your life it would serve you to be the bigger person and communicate your boundaries and needs in a way that's going to help get her on-board rather than rile her. I'm not saying to coddle or use kid-gloves with her. Just know that, regardless of whether it's right or wrong, if you want to be received it may take a little time and effort. I'm not saying she's right or justified for her response (I agree that she's trampling all over your boundaries). Just that you may have to swallow a little pride and instead of responding in a snippy way (Which I absolutely understand doing and I have done many times myself), make yourself take a breath and fall back on a well-rehearsed script. Like, \"I need you to talk to me before making plans that involve me.\" I think it would also be a good idea to let her know your expectations, like, \" I have asked you X times to respect this boundary, and I will do Y if you continue.\" It's about defusing the situation, but not conceding your needs. It's not possible to completely avoid it if a person is petty or especially sensitive, but try to avoid giving them ammo against you (re:snippy). Make your language as plain and neutral as possible in your script. It's about communicating in a constructive way the contract terms in that relationship.\n\nAnd say, she keeps doing it, and your X was that you were going to stop taking her calls? Follow through. Maybe at some point there'll be a break through and she'll get that she's got to clean up her act, or down the line you get to a point where you want to see if she's learned her lesson. But follow through.\n\nAll that said, it's true that you're an adult. You literally don't have to even respond to her any more at all if you don't want to. If she's someone very toxic, for all I know it could be a great idea to go NC for a while. It's within your rights to tell her you need time away, or that you'll talk to her again in a month, or that you are straight up done! It's your call. Just try to think about what you need in the short term and the long term. Situations with highly-charged emotions or personal motives can be live wires that need time, space, and effort to get to the right solution if it's a relationship you want to maintain. \n\nSource: I have similar relationships with several family members.

You\u2019re sitting here talking about wanting to be treated like an adult while responding like a petulant child to everyone telling you that you could have handled it better.\n\nAnd yeah, rescheduling actually *does* enforce your boundary of needing to be asked for your time and not having it demanded of you. I\u2019ve set that same boundary exactly that way with family members, friends, and even clients by responding to things with \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m free on X, Y, and Z. Let me know which works best for you.\u201d", "Oh, aren\u2019t you cute in your total misinterpretation of what I said. \n\nI said you could reschedule. You can also simply say that doesn\u2019t work for me. \n\nAnd if you think it doesn\u2019t reinforce boundaries, then you need knew people in your life. \n\nNever once though, did I say you have to to do it. I said you could use a combination of rescheduling and just saying \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d", "I think OP has combined two issues and is approaching them both at a combined 11, but she\u2019s only verbalizing one and it\u2019s coming off strong. \n\nIssue 1) She tells me I have to do stuff, never asks.  Threat level - annoying. Solution, state a boundary, calmly, that you\u2019d like to be asked before plans are made, and remind/reinforce when necessary. \n\nIssue 2) She pressured me to miss work and other plans for family events she deems necessary. Threat level - medium high. Solution, politely but firmly say no, no is a complete sentence, gray rock until boundary is maintained. EXCEPT OP didn\u2019t address this. They essentially said \u201cask me nicely when you demand I made myself uncomfortable at your whim\u201d. \n\nThe way she commands OP isn\u2019t the problem, the underlying issue is her still viewing OP as a kid that needs maternal guidance. Address THAT. Sure, you can come at someone full throttle and match their energy, while simultaneously ignoring the real issue, but there\u2019s a reason all the JustNo folks don\u2019t recommend it. Not saying Aunt is a Narc, but hurt people act just like hurt animals, and they lash out. Assuming OP actually likes Aunt and wants her in their life, then it behooves them to approach the person on the level they are and not be disappointed at where you wish they were. It just\u2026makes life easier. And life is long.", "Indeed. Gen X Started pushing that boundary. We were raised by our TV so we had less tolerance for I am adult, obey me crap.", "From the introduction, it seems that your aunt genuinely cares about you, and you attacked your aunt over semantics and insinuated that she's rude to you and doesn't respect. You owe her an apology, and you should phrase your demands in a less antagonizing way.", "Please take your generalizations elsewhere. It's bullshit, especially when looking at a specific situation. You really think that prior to \"gen X\", no kid told their parent to shove their \"do as I say, not as I do philosophy\"?", "I think it was a lot more common with x and later, yes. Because generations prior had a lot more emphasis on family and obedience", "I'm a mid period boomer (so shoot me) and this 'authority' stuff really started to disappear with the early boomers, i.e. when they were growing up in the 50s and 60s.  A lot of it was to do with it being the post WW2 generation, when all sorts of things changed.\n\nThough I'm sure there were families where it carried on and still does today.", "YTA\u2026she seems to have your best intentions at heart. That\u2019s just her way of asking, you could still say no or that you have plans. I\u2019m sorry, but if someone contacts me and says we\u2019re going shoe shopping\u2026I\u2019m there. Calm down, there are much bigger problems in the world.", "NTA.", "NTA. You can appreciate all that she did for you, and still want to be treated with respect. You are an adult, and the relationship needs to evolve.", "Holy crap, are we related? Lol. NTA. Had the same conversation with my own mum. Lost her shit the fist few  times told her No is a complete sentence. The only way she learned to respect boundaries is people constantly having to enforce them. Keep at it", "If you are available, then drop the passive aggressive correcting. Added your rudeness on top of her rudeness isn\u2019t going to fix anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re not available, just say so. \u201cSorry, aunt. I\u2019m not available to go shoe shopping today.\u201d If you want to attempt it train her to ask that her than dictate, you can add \u201cI appreciate all you do, so please call me to ask about my availability in the future.\u201d\n\nBut your current approach is just as rude as her, and frankly she HAS done a lot for you, which she was in no way obligated to do, by your own account. She\u2019s entitled to a little grace from you. Because of that, YTA", "I'd look at the DEAR MAN, a technique for setting boundaries.", "OP I think she needs you to break it down for her if you want her to understand and not flip out. I mean either way she's in the wrong here, but if you want to have a positive relationship with her despite her bad attitude, you have to speak \"her language.\"\n\nEx: Hey Aunt I really appreciate that you want to involve me in these plans and that you are so caring to think of me, but the way you phrase these plans bothers me. I do want to spend time with you but sometimes I have my own plans and I would really appreciate it if, going forward, you could include me in the earlier stages so that I can discuss my availability with you prior to you making plans and then telling me when and where I am needed. I understand you are probably used to seeing me as a child since you were so heavily involved in my upbringing, which I am very grateful for, but I'm almost 30 now and it's no longer appropriate to make plans for me instead of *with* me. I'm sorry I upset you last time we spoke about this. That wasn't my intention. I just want to improve our communication and make sure that the plans you make are things I can actually attend.", "Yeah, OP\u2019s responses make me think they still have a lot of work to do in therapy.", "Just because your aunt did things which a parent should have done does not give her rights over your time or boundaries. In the same way a good parent would not be entitled to make these same demands of you.\n\nDo you think she is open to a conversation? That you appreciate everything she has done for you but she needs to treat you as an adult. That making plans with another adult involves asking and agreement. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Changing how people communicate is tough, but keep it up!", "NTA - I was reading that thinking oh she must be a teenager and then you drop the I\u2019m 28 years old bomb. What the literal fuck? Time to move out and move on.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult. You\u2019re aunt should respectfully ask you if you want to go/do something.", "Cut her off and out of your life.  NTAH.  I wouldn't tolerate anyone, even family telling me to 'never fucking mind'.", "Yes, where\u2019s this aunty? Id like to adopt her. \ud83e\udd23", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Could explain her reaction, if she\u2019s trying to help with that response.", "Maybe sit her down and explain it\u2019s inconsiderate to assume you can do something without asking first. Ask her if she would want someone to do that to her and how she would feel.", "The thing you\u2019re missing here is you can\u2019t make anyone do anything\u2026 you can either politely ask her to \u201cplease rephrase things because the way you\u2019re doing it is feeling like an order and I am not a child to be ordered around anymore.\u201d Or the like\u2026 OR you could simply just respond to her as though she\u2019s asking/inviting you every single time. \u201cOh I can\u2019t do 6pm for shopping today! Maybe we can schedule for tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThe choice is up to you, but one comes with the fact that you need to implement natural consequences to her crossing your boundaries and be ready to go no contact if she continues to cross them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "As I suspected, no wonder she flipped. Act like an adult if you want to be treated like one. Why didn\u2019t you take the books if they\u2019re important? She assumed you didn\u2019t want kiddy books leaving them behind. Or, does she clean your apartment when doing your laundry? I highly doubt she threw out your \u201cart inspiration\u201d books after you communicated their importance, just to ruin your day! Not to help you, or create space\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t know why she\u2019d be doing your laundry and have access to throw your precious jeans away. They probably looked like garbage to her.\n\nNot very mature to be holding a grudge over jeans and books at 28. Like a teenager screaming I\u2019m an adult without handling responsibilities of being one. I\u2019m with your aunt, you come across ungrateful to a woman who loves you like a mother. My hunch is that she was shocked by your request and it\u2019s not something previously communicated. I\u2019m an adult does not translate to ask, instead of tell me where to be.\n\nSounds like you\u2019ve crossed your aunt\u2019s boundary, respect.\n\nYTA", "I feel like saying \u201cif you phrase that as a request then sure\u201d doesn\u2019t achieve the goal: what do you say if you actually can\u2019t make it?\n\nHer phrasing it as a request doesn\u2019t help in that scenario. I do think that you need to say something adjusted like \u201cif you want me to do something with you, you\u2019ll need to ask me in advance so I can let you know if that works for me, sometimes it won\u2019t and if you don\u2019t ask first, the answer is always going to be no\u201d.", "NTA. Sure, you could have phrased it differently, but setting that boundary? Completely fine.\n\nI saw a bunch of comments arguing about what a \"boundary\" is. \nIn literally the simplest form, boundaries are a recipe that uses what an individual defines as an acceptable or unacceptable interaction to create their reaction to the situation.\n\nOP had defined being ordered around as an Unacceptable Interaction. If someone orders them around, they'll React by asking that person to rephrase the way they said it so it's not a demand.\n\nIf the other person sees OP's Reaction as an Unacceptable Interaction, they might React like OP's aunt.\n\nIf they see it as an Acceptable Interaction, they'll rephrase and learn that ordering around OP is an Unacceptable Interaction, and that Asking is more Acceptable when it comes to interacting with OP. \n\nIt's not about controlling or telling other people what to do. Its about both parties being aware of the others standards of Acceptable and Unacceptable Interaction so that they can work together within the boundaries, if they can.", "No judgements either way.\n\nI firsthand know some people do great with soft requests and others won't get the point unless it's blunt as can be.\n\nYou know your aunt better than we do.", "NTA\n\nContinue to handle thing bluntly until they understand that you are an adult who can make her own decisions and choices.", "NTA. Enough said.", "NTA, but also you got a reaction that\u2019s clearly not what you wanted so perhaps a softer approach could have worked. That\u2019s the disconnect between therapy/therapists and the real world. \n\nYour could reply: Thanks for thinking of me/thanks for the invite, I\u2019ll get back to you this afternoon if I can make it. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to accept the premise of the statement (we are going) to reply in a way that recognises your boundaries (it\u2019s a request, I\u2019m free to accept or decline as I see fit). \n\nIt could quite literally just be the way she phrases things, and correcting that isn\u2019t that important as everyone is different. The important bit is how you internalise those as commands rather than the request it is, and you are free to (as an adult) accept or decline those.", "I would tell her that anything given as an edict gets an automatic NO, this needs to be the hard boundary regardless of your availability. If she asks/requests, she'll get a well thought out answer, which could still be no if you have plans/other priorities.\n\nBe prepared to walk out or hang up as needed to enforce your boundaries. This is not going to be solved quickly but it never will if you don't keep your boundaries."]}
