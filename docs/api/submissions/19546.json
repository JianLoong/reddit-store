But how was parading around in front of them with your ass hanging out \"calling them out\"? \n\nFirst of all, you literally DIDN'T call them out, which would have required that you actually use your words like an adult and tell them that you overheard them and were really bothered by them discussing your body like that; and secondly . . . you basically demeaned and objectified YOURSELF by stripping down and showing them exactly what they were only talking/speculating about.  You literally were like, \"You're going to talk about my body and objectify me? I'll show you! I'll take off my pants and objectify MYSELF for you!\" \n\nThis whole thing seems very childish, but more importantly, completely self-defeating.", "Eh.... ESH\n\nThey shouldn't be talking about your body. \n\nBut if you did want to call them out, instead of parading your blue booty around and giving them a show, you could have yelled into the room During their conversation, \n\n\"yeah my ass Does look great in that blue number but I don't see why it's any of your business\" \n\nor \n\n\"hang on I'm feeling left out, I gotta call my girlfriends so we can talk about Your hairy asses\"\n\nCalling them out is different from giving them a peek of your 'perfect ass' or whatever....", "YTA OP. And if you think your little stunt means they won\u2019t talk about you like that again, you are absolutely wrong. They\u2019ll just make sure you aren\u2019t in the house, if that. Coz honestly if I were talking about another woman\u2019s man like that and he heard and did this, that would be a \u201ccome on\u201d, not a put off. \ud83d\ude44", "YTA - what point were you trying to make? This seems odd and petty.", "YTA first yes what they said was gross but then you basically rewarded them by prancing around in a thong. I\u2019d be super pissed if a friend was walking around basically bottomless in front of my husband and super disrespectful.", "YTA. This is weird and kinda trashy. You could\u2019ve called them out directly or said something sly but now you\u2019re just giving them a reward for their shitty comments. I\u2019m all for female empowerment as a female myself and I\u2019m sure you felt great but this wasn\u2019t a good way to handle it that\u2019s so weird", "LOL yikes YTA", "Flaunt it in front of another woman\u2019s man? Where is the revenge? You gave a free show. YTA.  Now you appear to be bragging. Dave had to tell his wife before she found out elsewhere. The point could have been made wearing the thong over a pair of shorts. Nothing wrong having a nice asset. Yours wasn\u2019t a topic that should have came up. This is more about you vs the wife. Should she be upset? I think so.", "This seems like a kink post instead of something that actually happened lmao. Who in their right mind would \u201ccall someone out\u201d for talking about their body by showing the exact body part they were talking about ??", "ESH and not surprised Dave's wife was pissed about it. Surprised he told her though.", "NTA. I am sure Dave sees lots of asses every time they go to the beach. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest though, it feels more like a \u201cthank you for tbe compliment, here\u2019s a small reward\u201d than anything else.", "I can\u2019t even begin to wrap my head around why you thought this was a good idea????

Super disrespectful.\n\nYour stunt was petty.", "YTA, you disrespected Dave's wife by parading around with your butt hanging out. It was attention seeking at her expense. Aside from that, as far as I can tell you wanted him to look. If voyeurism is your kink find people who want to participate in it.", "lmaoooo YTA. Just fucking admit you wanna cheat with Dave or that you're an attention seeking floozy", "YTA\n\nYou over hear nice comments about your bottom, say it bothers you being objectified, and then proceed to purposely show it off. I just can't get the dots to connect. \n\nMaybe because I'm vain and just love overhearing nice comments about me.

If any of my friends, drunk or otherwise, ever said anything like that I\u2019d find it extremely offputting and firmly squash it, but that\u2019s just me.", "ESH. You basically rewarded Dave by showing him what your husband joked about him seeing. I also can\u2019t believe Dave went home and told his wife he saw your ass lol. You all sound a bit nuts.", "Whole thing is weird. They gave you a compliment and you felt like you had to make some point about it? What point were you making?", "NTA that\u2019s funny as hell, she can\u2019t get mad at you when he commented on your ass first.", "Lol. Everyone is the asshole\ud83e\udd23 What a ridiculous situation\ud83d\ude02 I feel like you appreciated the comment. Then, when your husband added to it, you decided to show off. Busted by Dave\u2019s wife\ud83e\udd23 YTA", "NTA it\u2019s not like you were leading him on. You were deliberately making him uncomfortable for objectifying you\u2026 which had made you uncomfortable. I say bravo, cleverly done.", "NTA. I thought it was funny, but Dave has a big mouth.", "NTA - This is hilarious, both my wife and I say you played this perfectly. You made them uncomfortable and got an apology. No harm done. Dave\u2019s wife needs to chill and Dave should remember that what happens at poker night (and the day after) stays at poker night. Unless of course Dave didn\u2019t tell her the full story and she now thinks you\u2019re parading around in front of her man. Either way, your house, your body.

Nice one.", "NTA, this is hilarious. Well played!", "NTA and it sounds like you and your husband have a nice trusting rship and he has decent friends too.

Maybe talked to your husband that morning about how inappropriate their comments were. But your husband also could have like, I dunno, told his buddy to stfu because his behavior, drunk or not, was unnecessary. Also. Does buddy's wife expect him to pluck his eyes out whenever they're at the pool or beach, where women wear bikinis?

They are going to think that you approved of their comments because it looks like you are showing off your \u201cperfect ass\u201d to them. It\u2019s such a strange strategy.
