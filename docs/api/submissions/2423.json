Unbeknownst to me my grandparents had called the cops to breakup the fight. While I was gone the police had a talk with my sister who told them that \u201cI beat her on a regular basis and she is scared to be in the house when I\u2019m there\u201d which is obviously a complete lie, I have never put a hand on her with the intention of hurting her. The cop then pressed charges on me without my side of the story, if I was at home when she told him this I would\u2019ve been arrested on the spot, thankfully I wasn\u2019t arrested at all, but I had to have a hearing and thankfully it didn\u2019t go any farther than that. Now fast forward to the present, I had another fight with my sister over my girlfriend. My sister was upset because I was \u201cputting my girlfriend before my own family\u201d aka, her. To which I responded by telling her i haven\u2019t thought of her as family since the day she tried to put me in prison, now everybody is calling me an asshole for it, even my own girlfriend.

Id be side eyeing your girl real hard right now too, like excuse tf outta you miss thing you find that accceptable for a person to do. Yh be cutting that shit off very quickly.

With being sibling and all there has been roughhousing that resulted in someone getting hurt\nEdit: all of which being unintentional", "Yeah but her brother was probably already not in the best mental health situation. I recommend getting your girlfriend therapy since she has guilt over something that wasn\u2019t in her control.\n\nBut you are not an AH. I also recommend going NC with your sister.

No one needs toxic people in their lives, and sometimes family members are the toxic ones.", "NTA\n\nFamily is more than DNA. It's loyalty, love, respect, support. It's *not* making potentially life-destroying false accusations.\n\nAs for your gf, since she thinks you should be nice to your sister despite what she did and said because *family* must always come first, listen and put your family first. Oh, that's right. She's not your sister anymore. Funny how that works.", "Honestly her pulling this really pisses me off.

I thought the same thing about the sister. Women who make false claims of abuse absolutely infuriate me. It makes life so much harder for actual people being victimized and abused.

Your gf should be on your side.", "You know who also gravely/fatally hurt themselves? People falsely accused of serious crimes. You know who else? People who are forced to deal with horrible family. And who else? People who are forced to give up their own agency and self preservation because \u201cfamily\u201d. The list goes on. It\u2019s unfortunate the situation she and her brother went through. But your sister is not the same as her brother. Your sister is very entitled and disrespectful. Forgiveness does not mean you don\u2019t have a change in opinion of her. It also doesn\u2019t mean she gets to reestablish a familial role in your life. Your GF needs therapy, not say in your family business/drama.", "Well as someone who's brother used to beat the shit out of her on a regular basis, you go ahead and think of that liar as no longer your family.\n\n\nI've also lost a best friend who was an absolute brother to me to suicide, and another brother to a parental divorce and then drug overdose.\n\n\nThe one who beat me (and worse) is still alive.\n\n\nBut he is not my brother.\n\n\nMy only brother now is my little brother.\n\n\nWhat your sister did belittled victims everywhere. It takes away from the small nugget of belief we have, and sows doubt and distrust in those who should be helping us escape those situations, encouraging them to ignore distress calls and call them \"civil disputes\" until it's too late.", "Who cares! Tell her what your sister did and then go NC with your sister. If your GF doesn\u2019t care I would seriously evaluate the relationship.

Im 35 now i still get nightmares, i scream cry  because i still wake feeling like tyson used me for practice an the physical ramifications of 18yrs of being someones punching bag has left me disabled. This mans life would of been over if the lie was beilved, i can't wont an will never understand how anyone could put another in such a vile postion", "My brother has hit me, I've hit him.
