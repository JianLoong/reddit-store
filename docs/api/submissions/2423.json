I recommend getting your girlfriend therapy since she has guilt over something that wasn\u2019t in her control.\n\nBut you are not an AH. I also recommend going NC with your sister.

And who else? People who are forced to give up their own agency and self preservation because \u201cfamily\u201d. The list goes on. It\u2019s unfortunate the situation she and her brother went through. But your sister is not the same as her brother. Your sister is very entitled and disrespectful. Forgiveness does not mean you don\u2019t have a change in opinion of her. It also doesn\u2019t mean she gets to reestablish a familial role in your life. Your GF needs therapy, not say in your family business/drama.", "Well as someone who's brother used to beat the shit out of her on a regular basis, you go ahead and think of that liar as no longer your family.\n\n\nI've also lost a best friend who was an absolute brother to me to suicide, and another brother to a parental divorce and then drug overdose.\n\n\nThe one who beat me (and worse) is still alive.\n\n\nBut he is not my brother.\n\n\nMy only brother now is my little brother.\n\n\nWhat your sister did belittled victims everywhere.

Tell her what your sister did and then go NC with your sister. If your GF doesn\u2019t care I would seriously evaluate the relationship.

Im 35 now i still get nightmares, i scream cry  because i still wake feeling like tyson used me for practice an the physical ramifications of 18yrs of being someones punching bag has left me disabled. This mans life would of been over if the lie was beilved, i can't wont an will never understand how anyone could put another in such a vile postion", "My brother has hit me, I've hit him.

You didnt 'intend' to hurt her, means you did.  Police wouldnt have pressed charges without some evidence.

You said you never put your hands on her with the intention of hurting her so it sounds like you were actually hitting your sister and maybe deserved the cops called on you", "Keeping your sister around can cause more damage to your relationships.  And if you have kids and they see how she treats people and begin to think that's OK. Well you have to pick up the pieces.

Honestly you should\u2019ve pressed charges on her for lying.", "NTA, that\u2019s not family.", "NTA I have always believed family are those closest to you through love and caring. being related by blood means absolutely nothing at all. I agree that her actions removed her from your family and she will have to live with the consequences. Has she ever publicly apologised for her actions? Has she ever tried to make it up to you? Was she even charged with making a false statement? How do the people attacking you justify this?", "NTA. I'm a familial abuse and domestic abuse survivor. Lying about abuse is never never never ok.

She lied about you hitting her, that could've ended you up in jail. Family doesn't do that. I'd kick her to the curb and stay far away from her. Who says she won't lie about you hitting or sexually abusing her next?", "NTA. My sister did the same thing to me. Difference was, we were in our 40\u2019s. Haven\u2019t spoken to her since. I could have lost my job, my house, everything. She did not give a shit. Fuck her!", "NTA and I\u2019d cut contact with your sister as well.", "Why are you still close enough to your sister to engage in arguments with her?", "NTA. what was a sibling squabble got way out of hand. Your sister lied and ought to have known the consequences of that lie. Domestic violence is always taken seriously by law enforcement. She then left you to deal with the court hearings, and all the fallout from her lie. She hasn't acted like a sister. She doesn't get to claim family relations only when it suits her.", "You said you have forgiven each other but clearly you have not.", "Lying to the fuzz is pretty serious. Obvi NTA.", "NTA\nYour sister wasted police resources, made genuine victims be disbelieved because of liers like her, tried to put you in prison and now complains you're putting someone ahead of family?? Your sister sounds toxic AF. I'd go NC with her immediately. \n\nAnd your GF needs to have a wakeup call. Family interaction isn't positive when your family member is toxic and a danger to you (as your sister has shown herself to be). She's seeing this strictly through a lense of what she experienced. But her experience isn't yours. Your GF needs to figure out what empathy is, because not everyone else's life is like hers.", "I\u2019m suspicious as to weather or not your telling the truth", "NTA being honest now will pave the way forward.", "Agree... My family been 'DEAD' since they tried to sabotage my marriage and life.\nEven after I become a widow they still 'Dead' and some of them literally death and I didn't even care.", "He said grandparents called the police because the yelling, no because there was physical assault. Also, when you have siblings you normally have friendly or playful wrestlings with them, sometimes you end up hurting them without wanting, that's probably what he meant. Also, yes, the police can press charges in someone without proves and just the testimony and other things, there's not need of visual proves, or sometimes even the testimony is enough, it depends of the country or state.", "Yall never just fuck around with your Siblings. Wrestling, full contact sports or sword fighting? Like yall just don't have those memories? Hit your Siblings doesn't always mean in a fight", "If someone knowingly lied to the cops to get me arrested, I would absolutely NOT go near them. Not even for a family meal.

Sit her down and have a talk because you may not view your family (aka your sister) the way she wants you to view it. This really needs to be discussed.", "I haven\u2019t seen or contacted my sibling in 15 years because of them accusing me of things that never happened. I stay away from these people.", "My siblings and I used to beat the shit out of each other, we never called the cops tho and we cool now", "Idt she sided with the sister but it is definitely something to watch out for OP", "I just want to know how your parents ever let your sister go through with it and for it to go as far as a court summons."]}
