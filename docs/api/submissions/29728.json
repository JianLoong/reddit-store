Do you KNOW how many kids OD on meds that are left out every year!? What you SHOULD do is call him and tell him you're in the ambulance on the way to the ER with one of the kids who has OD'd on the Tylenol he left out. See if he still thinks you're micromanaging him. But that will likely just piss him off more when he realizes it's a false alarm. It would almost be worth it, though, to say \"Now, do you understand? That OMG feeling you just had? What if that had been real? Because one of these days, it's GOING to be real, and this is going to be a REAL phone call, either from me, the police, or the ER, telling you that one of the kids has OD'd.\" \n\nDo you know what they do for kids that OD on Tylenol? First of all, if they've JUST taken it, we TRY to get them to throw it up. If that doesn't work, we give them a SHIT TON of activated charcoal to try to neutralize as much of it as we can, and then we RACE our butts to the ER where the EXTREMELY frightened child has to have their stomach pumped. I am then REQUIRED BY LAW to report you to the Child Welfare Office for NEGLIGENCE and CHILD ABUSE and CHILD ENDANGERMENT. I don't have a choice. It is the LAW. Social Services shows up at your home and starts an investigation on HOW in the HELL a CHILD got an ENTIRE BOTTLE of Tylenol down their gullet. \n\nMeanwhile, back at the hospital, we are evaluating this child's condition, and putting them in a \"Priority Number\" on what is called \"UNOS\". It stands for The United Network for Organ Sharing. Because your child now needs a new liver, and depending on how much got into their system, they could very well need new kidneys as well, but the kidneys aren't going to matter if we can't get this child a liver. You cannot LIVE without a functioning liver. We can buy you a SMALL measure of time, and I mean a VERY small measure of time, but not much. \n\nSo, while you're being investigated for child abuse/neglect, your child is laying in the hospital, frightened, and alone because you can't be with them because you're dealing with Social Services. And GOD FORBID this child should pass...Lord God....it does happen. Now your charges are upgraded depending on the State you live in to account for this child's death. I'm telling you this because these are the things that not necessarily YOU need to think about because clearly YOU are aware. But your HUSBAND needs to get his head out of his arse, and understand what is in his future. \n\nNow, if it was me, I would go out and get a lockbox. They are relatively cheap. You can get them at any Sports and/or Outdoorsy store. Tractor Supply type stores will have them, Sports stores will have them, Home and Garden type stores with have them. Amazon. You can get them on Amazon pretty cheaply. But get yourself a lockbox and LOCK THAT STUFF UP. If he's going to continue to act like a child, TREAT him like one. Put ALL the household medication in the lockbox. He needs Tylenol? He can ask you for it. He needs an aspirin? He can ask you for it. He needs Motrin? He can ask you for it. Motrin is not AS bad of an OD med, but it's STILL harmful if OD'd on for kids. ASA (aspirin) is a blood thinner, and you definitely don't want them OD'ing on that. They could bleed out internally. LOCK IT UP. He can keep his meds at work if he so chooses or he can RESPECTFUALLY request them from you, the keeper of the keys. DO NOT give him the keys. You will just have a wide open box.\n\nI'm sorry to be so graphic, but parents who ignore their kid's needs and let them get intentionally hurt make me REALLY angry, and I can't TELL you how often we see it. If this post can stop that for just ONE child...then I'm happy. I hope that this helps you, and helps your children. Good luck to you, Miss.", "My husband had this problem too. Not just with Tylenol but everything.\n\nThen I started locking everything up and the key was on the car keys. \n\nHe lost his mind when he couldn't get some NyQuil while I was away. \n\nSo I told him that he's too irresponsible to handle medicine since he leaves it everywhere with the lids off. So once he grows up, he too can have a key for the locked cupboard. Until then, none of the children in the house get access to the special cupboard. \n\nHe pulled his head out of his ass pretty quickly.", "Tell him micromanaging him would be you following him around telling him how to do things.  So he would never have the chance to leave the bottle there in the first place. \n\nSince you are trying to correct his behaviour and that doesn\u2019t seem to be working, I would offer to micromanage him so he can see the difference and if that\u2019s what he needs in order to actually make the house safe for the kids.  \n\nEither that or you can put things in time out so that he either had to earn them back. Or he has to ask you for them as he obviously isn\u2019t responsible enough to handle taking medication on his own. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Search him up some emergency videos due to children taking medications they grab in their own homes. \"Nagging?\" Are you serious dude? This is literally a life or death scenario. YES, IT'S THAT SERIOUS. Ffs, this isn't a time to pout or accuse the mature one (you) of dramatics.", "NTA\n\nNagging someone about the \"correct\" way to load the dishwasher is one thing.  Telling someone off for leaving medicine the kids can reached in an open bottle is being a responsible parent.", "NTA. He should have concern for the safety of his own children, not expect you to clean up after him. And fwiw, when I worked for CPS not keeping medications locked away was grounds for removal of children (from foster families and from bio-families).", "Tylonel OD's can cause permanent liver damage. NTA.", "NTA and I find it alarming he doesn't even care if his children poison themselves because of his inability to put a cap back on the pills. I'm a petty AH so I would get a lock box for all meds that way you control it and can supervise since he can't be a grownup and do it himself.", "NTA. If medicine is left out, throw it away. Seriously. Every time. If he can't take proper precautions, he shouldn't have it. You're not his mommy.", "I remember when I had family staying with me, and they would leave alcohol out. (I don\u2019t drink) \n\nOne time it was vodka in a glass, kids thought it was water, thankfully I grabbed it before they drank it. I was done with reminding them, and banned alcohol. They were not happy. But I told them they either play by my rules, or they leave. I didn\u2019t care if they went out and drank. But no alcohol in my house because I couldn\u2019t trust them to put it somewhere the kids couldn\u2019t get it \n\n\nNTA, it\u2019s dangerous and could cost you your kids lives.", "Your husband is behaving like an ass. He's putting your kids in danger but he's angry at you?\n\nI hope he has a lot of good points, because ugh.", "I really appreciate the reality check from everyone. Him being in the home taking medication is something that just started recently. When I noticed him being careless initially, I purchased one of those weekly pill organizers. To help him manage it better. I fill them for him weekly and put all of the medications up in a very high and hidden place. I figured it would be easier for him to manage when he is in a rush and not leave 5 pill bottles laying around. It has helped, but tonight he asked for Tylenol. I told him where to find it and he left in a hurry and left it in the edge of the counter open. I became angry, and I believe rightfully so.\n\n I purchase a lock box that will be here tomorrow. I do take my children\u2019s safety very seriously. And again I appreciate the harsh reality check. Thank you all.", "NTA.\n\nI'm seconding the person who said to get a lock box and make him have to ask you every time he wants any medication. \n\nHe wants to act like a child, he will be treated as such.", "NTA. That\u2019s so incredibly dangerous and the gaslighting is so incredibly immature. One of these days you may not be the first to notice and it only takes once for a kid to get really hurt.", "NTA - that shit is toxic to little kids", "NTA. Bullshit say nothing. How about he grows the hell up and acts responsible.", "I mean. You are nagging him-bc he's an irresponsible ah. Lock up the meds where he can't get then without your supervision.

What a self-absorbed A-H.", "NTA. So much NTA. \n\nOn a totally unrelated note, did you know that divorced mothers do less housework than married mothers? It's like having one less child to clean up after, apparently!", "Fill a bottle with tic tacs pour them out by the child and scream real loud he might learn then", "I mean you wouldn't have to micromanage him if he could manage being a responsible parent. NTA, but your husband is a huge one", "NTA. That sounds exhausting. He has no right to be upset with you when his actions put your kids in danger.", "I fervently hope that he never finds out how it will feel when his child is rushed to the ER specifically because he was careless.\n\nWhat happens when it isn't Tylenol, but rather diabetes medication.
