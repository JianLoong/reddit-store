Do you KNOW how many kids OD on meds that are left out every year!? What you SHOULD do is call him and tell him you're in the ambulance on the way to the ER with one of the kids who has OD'd on the Tylenol he left out. See if he still thinks you're micromanaging him. But that will likely just piss him off more when he realizes it's a false alarm. It would almost be worth it, though, to say \"Now, do you understand? That OMG feeling you just had? What if that had been real? Because one of these days, it's GOING to be real, and this is going to be a REAL phone call, either from me, the police, or the ER, telling you that one of the kids has OD'd.\" \n\nDo you know what they do for kids that OD on Tylenol? First of all, if they've JUST taken it, we TRY to get them to throw it up. If that doesn't work, we give them a SHIT TON of activated charcoal to try to neutralize as much of it as we can, and then we RACE our butts to the ER where the EXTREMELY frightened child has to have their stomach pumped. I am then REQUIRED BY LAW to report you to the Child Welfare Office for NEGLIGENCE and CHILD ABUSE and CHILD ENDANGERMENT. I don't have a choice. It is the LAW. Social Services shows up at your home and starts an investigation on HOW in the HELL a CHILD got an ENTIRE BOTTLE of Tylenol down their gullet. \n\nMeanwhile, back at the hospital, we are evaluating this child's condition, and putting them in a \"Priority Number\" on what is called \"UNOS\". It stands for The United Network for Organ Sharing. Because your child now needs a new liver, and depending on how much got into their system, they could very well need new kidneys as well, but the kidneys aren't going to matter if we can't get this child a liver. You cannot LIVE without a functioning liver. We can buy you a SMALL measure of time, and I mean a VERY small measure of time, but not much. \n\nSo, while you're being investigated for child abuse/neglect, your child is laying in the hospital, frightened, and alone because you can't be with them because you're dealing with Social Services. And GOD FORBID this child should pass...Lord God....it does happen. Now your charges are upgraded depending on the State you live in to account for this child's death. I'm telling you this because these are the things that not necessarily YOU need to think about because clearly YOU are aware. But your HUSBAND needs to get his head out of his arse, and understand what is in his future. \n\nNow, if it was me, I would go out and get a lockbox. They are relatively cheap. You can get them at any Sports and/or Outdoorsy store. Tractor Supply type stores will have them, Sports stores will have them, Home and Garden type stores with have them. Amazon. You can get them on Amazon pretty cheaply. But get yourself a lockbox and LOCK THAT STUFF UP. If he's going to continue to act like a child, TREAT him like one. Put ALL the household medication in the lockbox. He needs Tylenol? He can ask you for it. He needs an aspirin? He can ask you for it. He needs Motrin? He can ask you for it. Motrin is not AS bad of an OD med, but it's STILL harmful if OD'd on for kids. ASA (aspirin) is a blood thinner, and you definitely don't want them OD'ing on that. They could bleed out internally. LOCK IT UP. He can keep his meds at work if he so chooses or he can RESPECTFUALLY request them from you, the keeper of the keys. DO NOT give him the keys. You will just have a wide open box.\n\nI'm sorry to be so graphic, but parents who ignore their kid's needs and let them get intentionally hurt make me REALLY angry, and I can't TELL you how often we see it. If this post can stop that for just ONE child...then I'm happy. I hope that this helps you, and helps your children. Good luck to you, Miss.", "My husband had this problem too. Not just with Tylenol but everything.\n\nThen I started locking everything up and the key was on the car keys. \n\nHe lost his mind when he couldn't get some NyQuil while I was away. \n\nSo I told him that he's too irresponsible to handle medicine since he leaves it everywhere with the lids off. So once he grows up, he too can have a key for the locked cupboard. Until then, none of the children in the house get access to the special cupboard. \n\nHe pulled his head out of his ass pretty quickly.", "Tell him micromanaging him would be you following him around telling him how to do things.  So he would never have the chance to leave the bottle there in the first place. \n\nSince you are trying to correct his behaviour and that doesn\u2019t seem to be working, I would offer to micromanage him so he can see the difference and if that\u2019s what he needs in order to actually make the house safe for the kids.  \n\nEither that or you can put things in time out so that he either had to earn them back.

I figured it would be easier for him to manage when he is in a rush and not leave 5 pill bottles laying around. It has helped, but tonight he asked for Tylenol. I told him where to find it and he left in a hurry and left it in the edge of the counter open. I became angry, and I believe rightfully so.\n\n I purchase a lock box that will be here tomorrow.

We always seemed to drop off and pick up at the same time.  We both picked our kids up one evening, said goodnight and went home to make dinner. We\u2019d talked about what we were making.  The next day she wasn\u2019t there with her child. Wasn\u2019t there the next day. Or the next. I finally asked if her child was ok \u2026 meaning sick\u2026 when I saw the teachers all huddled together crying at pickup time.  \n\nThe mom had gone home that evening and started making dinner. Her purse was somewhere her child could reach up and grab, and she managed to open some type of medication bottle. It was never said publicly what kind of medication it was.  The child ate everything in the bottle. By the time her mom finished cooking that one thing in the kitchen and went to look for her she\u2019d been lying there for an undetermined period of time.  She had very little brain function left. \n\nI used to see the woman and her very small but grown daughter from time to time.

I also learnt after my first transplant that if you weight under 52kg (which isn\u2019t uncommon for smaller adults/teenagers etc) then you should be taking half the dose that\u2019s recommended for adults on the boxes. \n\nThe doctors still don\u2019t know what caused my first acute liver failure (my liver was beyond testing for most causes- but it wasn\u2019t drink or drugs as people tend to assume when they hear a 19 year old had a transplant.). However, I was lying in ICU having just been transferred to a transplant centre and apparently the surgeons had to come round and send my family away to talk to me to see if I\u2019d tried to overdose and if I\u2019d ruin another liver on purpose. I have no idea what I said to them, I don\u2019t remember any of it, but in my delirium (another symptom of liver failure) I must have said the right things for them to be convinced. Obviously they wouldn\u2019t hold anything like that against a child who just got into their parents meds, but there is a limited supply of livers and you can\u2019t guarantee one would become available in time. \n\nLiver transplant is ROUGH to recover from- my doctors said one of the biggest surgeries the human body can go through- and for a child who doesn\u2019t understand what happened and why they hurt so much, can\u2019t walk, have to take medication for life when they were healthy just a few days before it would most likely be incredibly traumatic. Most children who have transplants have had conditions for years and been prepared for the possibility of having a transplant for years before it happens; they still struggle and they\u2019re at a point where they\u2019ve become incredibly unwell and getting a transplant is like getting their life back again. Having it all happen in a matter of days (2 in my case) and most likely not realising what\u2019s happening the whole time is something that kids can sometimes be really resilient with, and sometimes it\u2019s just too much to understand for a long time. I\u2019m not a parent, but I know I\u2019d do anything to make sure my kid don\u2019t have to go through the whole process, especially if it just meant putting the cap back on the medication bottle and pushing it further back on the counter so the kids can\u2019t reach it.
