That means to engage with your managers to ensure you have the right support and resources for you and your team to do your jobs to the best of your ability. If you're getting so much work that it can't be completed by the required deadlines, then you are not getting the right support and resources. \n\nIn turn, that affects how you manage your team. If you're putting your team under constant pressure to achieve impossible targets, you're going to lose your team. If your team doesn't see you sticking up for them, you're going to lose your team. If your team believes you're siding with the people putting them under ridiculous pressure, you're going to lose your team. \n\nYou seem to have an attitude that you, and your team, just have to accept your boss treating you poorly just because \"he's the BOSS\". That's not how it works. If your boss is setting unrealistic targets or speaking to your team in an unprofessional manner, it's your job to address that with him. \n\nYour problem seems to be that you have the idea that you should kowtow and fear the person above you, while receiving the same treatment from those below you, so you can't understand how someone who reports to you has the backbone to speak back to someone above you. Your boss is a person just like you and I. If he's in the wrong, tell him. \n\nDon't threaten your subordinates with losing their job just because they got tired of waiting for you to do your job.", "YTA. You obviously have no idea what you are doing and you are the one that should get fired", "YTA. It doesn't sound like she's being rude, it sounds like she has boundaries. You have no right to tell her she doesn't get to have boundaries. I guess now she will be speaking up to you more instead of speaking up WITH you to the boss.\n\nAlso, check your biases. Women in the workplace are often stereotyped as difficult or outspoken for voicing the same reasonable concerns men do all the time.", "YTA stand up for the people you manage and tell your boss his passive-aggressive behavior is creating a toxic atmosphere.", "YTA.

Your team will eventually gain trust in you and they will be less likely to feel the need to level-skip you, knowing they can rely on your judgement and action to keep their working life manageable and productive.\n\nUnjustified: If you are certain this person is addressing things either unreasonably or via inappropriate means, you need to sit down with them and have a sensible discussion around your expectations of them. Ultimatums achieve nothing and display emotional immaturity. \n\nSometimes these situations feel a bit beyond us as team leaders, that\u2019s ok, we have HR teams and upper management for a reason, reach out and ask them for advice, make sure you explain the situation accurately and without bias to ensure they can also fairly assess it. \n\nYou\u2019re stressed and overwhelmed, but in this case, you\u2019re still the AH, but at least it\u2019s a lesson learned for future, I recommend investing time building trust from your team to ensure that behaviour questioning your decisions does not escalate, managing a team that doesn\u2019t have faith in your is a miserable experience.", "YTA Get your head out of your boss's ass.", "Yta.

Are they solving the overwork problem? \n\nBecause if the excuse is that there is not enough money to pay them or train them or there aren't enough good candidates, then labour has the power. They should organize and contemplate striking. The company needs to turn down contracts and take on work within their means if they don't have the money to pay enough workers for the current workload. Or people will quit and quality will suffer through lack of institutional memory, and hiring and training costs money.

Performance critiques should always be reserved for the immediate supervisor.  Otherwise this guy is just the proverbial fifth wheel and a waste of space.
