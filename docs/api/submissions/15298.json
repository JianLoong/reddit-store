She is nothing but trouble that you don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford. Fuck her.", "YTA: So an assertive woman makes you look bad? Good. You\u2019re clearly misogynistic because most men stereotype assertive women as \u201cmouthy.\u201d She\u2019s just making expectations clear and setting reasonable boundaries. Your boss does suck. Sack up and support your team.", "Ngl you're coming off as a shit boss and a misogynist.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve stated several times that the workload and the demeanor of your boss aren\u2019t exactly appropriate or fair. You\u2019ve stated that your boss has been passive aggressive, and also rude. Your employee has openly stated her frustration about your boss in front of everyone. \n\nYou have two problems. First is that you have an asshat for a boss. Second is that your employee doesn\u2019t trust you to handle the situation, so she handles it for you. \n\nYou need to address the concerns with your boss, and work with your employee to utilize the proper chain of command *after* the issue with your boss has been remedied. If you continue to toe the line, make flagrant threats of termination, and be a general pushover with no control, I can guarantee you\u2019ll be fired eventually too. Your role is to act as an in between for your boss and your employees. You need to have a few tough conversations, and it starts with apologizing to your employee and having a conversation with your boss about his or her expectations and attitude towards their subordinates.", "YtA... you shouldn't have talked to her like that.... you should have taken her to the side and told her to bring complaints to you and you will do your best to solve issues and that her talking to the big boss like that risks both of your jobs... clarify that you won't be able to resolve all issues but you will do your best to make sure that her work load along with everyone on the teams is fair and reasonable... being a new manager isn't easy because people tend to lean 1 of 2 ways either they over compensate and are dicks or they try to be buddy buddy with everyone and don't do a good job... the best managers walk a very fine line between the 2... remain in charge but show them you care and aren't the bad guy... I would also point out that it's not in the teams best interest to be over worked as they will grow to hate their jobs and it doesn't look good if not only is the team unhappy but they aren't able to meet deadlines so it really is in everyone's interest for you to insure that the workload is fair", "As a manager, OP should be the one advocating for their team. The fact that their coworker feels the need to do it themselves suggests that either OP isn't doing that, or OP's predecessor didn't do that. I suspect some combination of both.\n\nI don't think the idea of a sit-down between the three of them is a good idea though. In order for that to work, OP would have to have some skills as a mediator, and would have to have the trust of the other two parties. Neither of these seem to be the case.\n\nOP needs to learn how to manage a team (the company has failed here by hiring someone with no management experience, and not providing training and support), they need to get their team to trust them. Ideally they should be pushing back against their boss, if the work assignments are unreasonable, but at the very least they should be a buffer, taking the blame when things don't get done. \n\nMiddle management sucks. You have plenty of responsibility, but no real control (and often very little training). And certain types of people make up for that feeling of powerlessness by being petty tyrants and bullies.", "Also, I will point out, that the other co-workers are mad, because the outspoken woman is actually saying all the things they want to say to the boss and that OP is not conveying and they don't want her fired.", "As a manager, wholeheartedly agree with this. YTA, OP. Do better.", "also sounds like a case of a man thinking a woman is being bossy just because she is authoritative. OP never said the boss is mad just that OP wants her to submit", "Boss gets passive aggressive but also doesn\u2019t hold the deadline. God save me from bosses like this.", "This!", "It\u2019s gonna take more than a class to grow a spine to handle the employee and the boss with respect and make an actual change.", "Honestly, if OP's overriding concern is how it reflects on him, rather than on addressing what it signifies - an unsustainable workload, a toxic management culture, and a team that can't trust him as their manager to step up for them when they need him - then he really shouldn't be a manager at all.", "Also the first few sentences hint at misogyny frankly. Maybe experience has made me bitter, but outspoken men RARELY get called \"loud mouths\" and threatened with their jobs for having opinions and speaking up on shit that's not okay.", "Well I mean, it does reflect badly on him because a woman \u201cunder his watch\u201d has to do his job for him lmao", "This. YTA", "Probably because he's bothered she's a woman, if she were a man dude would be framing it to be about how he's being overshadowed because they are stepping into his role and he feels it's rude to make him look like the incompetent leader he is. But because it's a woman \"she's a loudmouth\".", "Absolutely.", "Right?? Men RARELY get called \"loud mouths\" and threatened with their jobs for having opinions and speaking up on shit that's not okay.", "She's literally older than him.", "Why should she show professionalism when her boss isn\u2019t?", "Just because someone he rank doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right. You can\u2019t just treat your subordinates like shit and expect them to respect you", "I think this is the best clue as to who is in the right here", "Ita!", "Bingo", "100%", "That is true. But just bc you try to clap back doesn't mean you're right or know better on how the place is supposed to operate.\n\nBest course of action is to tell the place to kick rocks if they can't treat you properly.", "It OP won\u2019t be the manager these people need them someone else has to be.", "Yeah me too."]}
