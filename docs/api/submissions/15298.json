And then where will you be?", "YTA - She's defending herself from a bad boss, because you aren't. You think the boss deserves respect simply for being the boss, but that is garbage, except for perhaps in the military.\n\nIn the everyday world, the boss gets the respect that they earn. And you honestly DON'T get it, or you'd be addressing the real problem, which is the boss, not your workers.\n\nThey have every right to complain if one of their leaders (you) is too complacent or lazy to stand up for them, and their big boss knows it, empowering him to make extreme demands.\n\nYou tell her she doesn't need to speak up, when your actions make it clear that is she doesn't do it, no one will, because her supervisor is more interested in being a toady than taking care of her team.", "YTA op you do know a full group of workers will quit if they don't like management and don't like how they are treated. \n\nMy husband worked at a place where  the bad boss treated middle man like shit.they were sexist and didn't care about her. She actually got married and all the restaurant was invited but and I'm pretty sure this is the tipping point he refused to close the place down for the wedding (everyone was pretty much invited to it as they knew each other and worked together for years). The manager had all her people there but due to issues the groom didn't get his best man in fear of getting fired by the big boss.  That was the tipping point it only takes one. Manager was tired of it and how she was treated and found a new job.big boss just hired a shit person who a month before she left she gave a few months ahead of time as she ran the place even though she was manager she did everything  so she could help train the guy he would bootlick like craZy the big boss while she tried to help him. No one liked him and they all followed the manager. The place went down hill and every member of server staff leaving with her made it so the new  manager was not doing well and getting treated like shit by owners because of it. They lost everyone and the manager left afterwards because he couldn't handle it. \n\nIf you do not treat your people good and work for them as they are your team and you are supposed to be their mouth to the big boss than you might end up fucked and out of workers.", "You're not a leader, nor a manager. You're a pushover and a yes-man. YTA", "So I have been a manager, a trainer, and a team lead at various points. Your comment is correct.\n\nHow situations like this should be handled:\nEmployees go to their manager with their work related issues. The manager discusses the issues, wither explains why things are one way or trying to solve the issue. This means, at times, going to bat for your team and speaking up to your boss.\n\nIn this situation it's clear they have too much work and are struggling, he essentially just stood up infront of his team and said he didn't care- i.e. killing the moral of his team.\nIn the end, his employee shouldn't HAVE HAD to speak up, even though she has that right because he's her manager not her mother. \n\nI digress, there is a right way and a wrong way to manage. Not to bring sex into this, but as a woman it's common to see men un lateral positions try to controle and dictate rather than collaborate and lead.\nWhile I am by no means an expert, my teams emwere constantly on top in our metrics so I was doing something right \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This ^ OP isn\u2019t even licking the boot.

That feels decidedly like standing up for them", "OP, You need to be on a management forum. You are getting bad judgements and bad advice. You are right.  She needs to talk to you.  You need to maintain the \"chain of command\".  That said, in public, is not the time to have this conversation.\n\nYou need to set the ground rules with your team on behavior in a dept meeting or 1-1, and then critique their performance 1-1 immediately (not at reviews)...\"you handled that well\", \"that wasn't the best approach, that ruins team cohesion\" ... \n\nThreatening their livlyhood in public can be warranted sometimes when someone is melting down, but mostly ... not.\n\nGet on a management sub (suggestions anyone?) ... and get advice from execs like myself who've managed 100s of folk.

I don\u2019t think you actually understand the role of a manager.", "You obviously have no idea how to manage up.

She's literally the only one doing their job", "Except we don\u2019t know if she was actually unprofessional, because OP refuses to give specifics on what she\u2019s saying and how she\u2019s saying it", "Agree and it\u2019s obviously not even close.", "LMAO, nice try.  47 year old professional woman here, and the employee\u2019s behaviour isn\u2019t uncommon at all, especially when they have a bad manager that isn\u2019t doing their job.  And it\u2019s absolutely applauded \u2026 when men do it.  Then they\u2019re assertive, leadership material, and frequently get promoted into the bad manager\u2019s position, either when he gets fired for incompetence or manages to schmooze his way into a higher role.

Not a good combo.\n\nOP needs to grow a spine.", "That's a fair assessment about the sit-down idea. Having no one experience myself, that's what I would do if I was put into the same position as OP to try to resolve any conflict that may be arising between the parties, but I can see how that could end up backfiring instead.\n\nAlso, very much agree that they need to push back against their director more instead of being a pushover. I thought I read in the original post that OP requests extensions from the boss, but on a second read that's never stated. He just provides the extension after realizing the team was unable to complete the work assigned it seems.\n\nIf you're struggling in your role, then maybe ask for help from another manager of one of the other 2 teams. Ask them for advise on what you should do moving forward if you think you're out of your depth in the new role (at least, that's what I would do). Its going to take some time to get a handle on things, and you've gotten off to a rocky start, but it's still early days. Take this as a learning experience OP and become a better manager because of it.", "sounds like op needs to speak up to his boss more", "100%", "No, no. What he said is that *his* boss hands out extensions like candy. He never made any indication that he was actively pushing for them.

That's not pushing for shit.", "I agree with you that he handled this terribly, but we\u2019re responding to the question of \u201cam I the asshole?\u201d not \u201cam I a good manager?\u201d People can say whatever the hell they want to say and they can also deal with the consequences. IMO OP is one of those managers that would (and have) throw their team under the bus in the name of bootlicking. He\u2019s definitely the asshole AND needs a better management style.", "Do not listen, she most likely a shit manager as well", "Whole heartedly agree!", "This. Also, document everything.

She needs to go to you with her complaints. You need to provide consideration for them and explain what you will or won\u2019t bring up to the boss in a private 1:1, and incorporate what you can into a team meeting.\n\nWhat she is doing is not kosher.

They constantly feel the need to flex their power/authority over people in many ways that are excessive or inappropriate.\n\n2. They get frustrated with how autonomous the general western worker is (and how we really hate micromanagers) and so they start to replace people on their teams with more Indian visa holders since the new employees will respond more appropriately to an authoritarian management style.", "Yep this!!!", "It\u2019s not appropriate to have a go at your grand boss in a meeting no matter your gender.
