We went over his future step mom (Korean) and dads (black) house for dinner. She made us delicious mouthwatering Korean barbecue. I was super thankful and on our way to the car I asked him , \u201cyou have to give me her number so she can tell me how she made that meal.\u201d Without missing a beat he said \u201cWell at least she didn\u2019t cook her dog.\u201d I froze in shock of what he said. Cameron never talked that way before so I wasn\u2019t expecting it. I slowly turned around and said, \u201cif you EVER say racist stuff like that again I will breakup with you.\u201d He said it was a joke and apologized. Cameron said this at the peak of of the Stop Asian Hate movement so not only was it racist it was extremely tone deaf. I decided to give him another chance because I knew my family liked him a lot. I shouldn\u2019t have but he was also my first relationship. Approaching our 2 years together he kept making ignorant and racist comments. I was fed up and broke up with him because of this and many other reasons. I didn\u2019t tell him why because I was tired of arguing. Here\u2019s where I might be the assholr. After the break up it bothered me that I never told his step mom or dad about what he said. I got her number after the dinner party so I texted her. I told her what he said and even added that his dad might not be like that but Cameron is like that. She never answered so I thought that was that. Then all of sudden I got an email from him on my student email since I blocked him everywhere. He accused me trying to break up his dad relationship and can\u2019t picture getting back  with me in the future. He said I was an asshole for telling her the racist stuff he\u2019s said about her to me. Cameron also said I almost ruined their relationship since she didn\u2019t know how racist he actually was. I said his own words caused that and I was just trying to warn her what type of family she\u2019s marring into. He then said he apologized but I shouldn\u2019t have tattled on him. I said whatever and I can never picture myself with a racist. I told my mom what I did and she laughed but then told me I should\u2019ve kept it to myself. I told her I don\u2019t like covering for racists but I think I might\u2019ve overstepped. I still think about it often and wonder if I was wrong to do what I did.
