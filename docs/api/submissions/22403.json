{"id": 22403, "submission_id": "151cqtm", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I hate her and will be putting her in a nursing home to rot?", "selftext": "I come from an extremely traditional Indian family where women are seen less inferior than men. I\u2019m the oldest daughter, so my mother has always resented me for being born as a female and \u201cruining\u201d her life since she had hoped for a boy. I\u2019m 20 now, but my mother finally got her wish a few years ago and gave birth to my now 8 year old brother. However, she treats me terribly compared to him. And I know that comparing myself to a 8 year old is bad, but ever since I was a child she\u2019s always told me how useless I am and how I should just leave home and get married or run away with some man so she never has to see me again. I\u2019ve always tolerated what she says because of filial piety but yesterday she really started getting on my nerves. I had just gotten home from work when she started to yell at me for never helping her with anything (She always likes to exaggerate as when in reality I do everything at her beck and call) and how she wishes for me to move out already (I\u2019m on summer vacation from college and don\u2019t have a place of my own). She was complaining about how she had to clean the house on her own while I was working. I don\u2019t understand, because it was her that used to scream at me for being jobless and not helping her pay bills. Now that I have a job it becomes my fault for not being at home to help her clean and cook. I tried to reason with her, but she got angrier and then began to tell me how unloved I am in this family and how she\u2019s never loved me. I was tired from working, and already sick of her attitude so I ended up lashing out at her for the first time in my life and told her that I hate her and have never seen her as my mother. I also said that she will end up in a nursing home considering how she\u2019s already so old and my younger brother is incapable of taking care of her at his age. She so got angry she kicked me out, so now I\u2019m staying at my cousin\u2019s house. However, my cousin\u2019s family is telling me I was in the wrong and that I should be gentle with my mother since she is the one who raised me (even if it was without love). I see posts like this on tiktok a lot and really wanted outsider opinions on my situation.

She can very well depend on him to fend for her. :) Br clear about it. Look for moving out soon you will be happier.", "NTA. I'm actually at a loss for words. One thing is very clear and that is you will never make her happy. Focus on your own happiness instead. This is no way for a mother should treat her child.", "NTA . She wanted you to move out and you did \n\nBtw how are using tiktok in India lol , i thought it's banned", ">  Make sure your money goes into bank accounts that are in your name only and your family can't access.\n\nThis is very important. Far too many times parents financially abuse their children. OP do not give your mom any of your money, ever. She'll shout and scream and stamp her feet, she'll make up sob stories, she'll recruit other family members as minions and send them after you, she'll cite fictitious laws and threaten to sue you. Hold firm.", "This - if she idolizes your brother so very much, then he can deal with her. Go live your own life.", "NTA. I\u2019m Middle Eastern so I understand everything about filial piety. I do believe that one should always be patient with their parents and care for them.\n\nHowever, no one can tolerate verbal abuse for ever. You were lashing out against not just out of anger but because you need to mentally to take care of yourself.\n\nYou need to move out. Either live with family who can be supportive or try to live on your own. Visit your mum on a limited basis.\n\nIf you can\u2019t move out the try to limit your presence at home by either getting more work or studies or finding hobbies you enjoy. Anything to get of the house more.\n\nSearch grey-rocking. Learn how to not emotionally respond to your mother. \n\nI really wish the strength to go through this.", "NTA but also not doing yourself any favors. The society you live in has a lot of unfair expectations of you. Your mother has alwayss lived in those expectations and has decided to put all of the blaim on you, instead of that society. Its easier to rage at you then change her world. You have a job, you have school. You need to focus on your goals. What you need to do to get yourself stable and safe. And then go from there. Everything else and everyone else is static noise to distract you. Also, no child chose to be born. No child OWES their parents life or for anything that went into raising them to adulthood.", "NTA\nShe uses you to be her verbal punching bag.

I'm Venezuelan, and hear the same things from my mother. Besides it is expected of me to take care of my mother when she is older. I think is hard and it comes with a lot of hard work but we have to focus on ourselves. Maybe in the future and at distance from her you can decide if you WANT to help her.

Go far away from the evil witch and start to heal. Maybe see a therapist. NTA", "just because she raised you, doesn't mean you owe her anything. she clearly was not a mother to you in any way that mattered, and I'm sick of the fact that we live in 2023 and *still* have this 'daughters are inferior' bullshit mentality. NTA. live your life and don't give her the satisfaction of even worrying about her.", "NTA and my heart breaks for you.\n\nI witnessed this kind of behavior (not verbally but the preferences were clear) when I lived overseas, with my exes relatives. I don't understand how someone could raise a cute child like that, when it is their responsibility for having it.", "NTA/ She may have brought you into this world, but that doesn't mean you have to spend your life indebted to her. Take this as your entry into freedom - take it from someone whose mother said she wished she'd miscarried because I moved halfway across the country for university: this is a blessing in disguise. Don't look back, find a place to live where you won't be guilted into returning, make something of your life.", "NTA\n\nTake that with a grain of salt since I come from the far off and weird white people nation of Canada where filial piety is held in low regard by the current generation and we toss our parents into the streets the moments we're able. All joking aside, your mother treats you like a slave, she dumps all her issues and aggression on you because she's not emotionally mature enough to handle it herself, and the fact that she raised you is not an excuse for that when she's made it quite blatantly clear that she feels she was wasting her time. You don't owe her gentleness, and if she so desperately wants you out of the house than you'd be doing yourself a favour in obliging that demand and cutting her out of your life firmly.", "NTA\n\nDo your best to move out....even out of the country.", "NTA\n\nRather than putting her in a nursing home, don't do anything at all. Leave her flounder on her own and go live your life without her.

You're worth more than your ovedience and gender. Best of luck.", "NTA  I cannot imagine how much this must impact your self esteem.  Take care of yourself.

That can, for instance, be up to your brother, or the state. It need not be yours to worry about.\n\nIn other words, you need not \\*even\\* put her in an old age home.\n\nI'm not saying you have to do any of this, just trying to expand your mind.
