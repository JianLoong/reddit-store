I\u2019m the oldest daughter, so my mother has always resented me for being born as a female and \u201cruining\u201d her life since she had hoped for a boy. I\u2019m 20 now, but my mother finally got her wish a few years ago and gave birth to my now 8 year old brother. However, she treats me terribly compared to him. And I know that comparing myself to a 8 year old is bad, but ever since I was a child she\u2019s always told me how useless I am and how I should just leave home and get married or run away with some man so she never has to see me again. I\u2019ve always tolerated what she says because of filial piety but yesterday she really started getting on my nerves. I had just gotten home from work when she started to yell at me for never helping her with anything (She always likes to exaggerate as when in reality I do everything at her beck and call) and how she wishes for me to move out already (I\u2019m on summer vacation from college and don\u2019t have a place of my own). She was complaining about how she had to clean the house on her own while I was working. I don\u2019t understand, because it was her that used to scream at me for being jobless and not helping her pay bills. Now that I have a job it becomes my fault for not being at home to help her clean and cook. I tried to reason with her, but she got angrier and then began to tell me how unloved I am in this family and how she\u2019s never loved me. I was tired from working, and already sick of her attitude so I ended up lashing out at her for the first time in my life and told her that I hate her and have never seen her as my mother. I also said that she will end up in a nursing home considering how she\u2019s already so old and my younger brother is incapable of taking care of her at his age. She so got angry she kicked me out, so now I\u2019m staying at my cousin\u2019s house. However, my cousin\u2019s family is telling me I was in the wrong and that I should be gentle with my mother since she is the one who raised me (even if it was without love).

She wants your life to take a nosedive so you can be as unhappy and miserable as she is, because of her jealousy. \nGo out and live your best life. Be happy, have incredible determination and drive to do and be what makes YOU thrive. \nIF you can arrange off campus housing year round so you can move, do it.

It is a valid question.  Don\u2019t get angry.  I can tell you that the calmer you can stay as she is ranting and raving, the more angry and confused she will be, and when she calls family to complain about you, you can honestly say that you didn\u2019t engage in yelling and shouting, you just asked the question, do you want this or this.

And what your mother has done all your life is abuse you. It may not have been physically but it is just as damaging. Put and end to the cycle of abuse and if that means ending your relationship with your mother than so be it.

I\u2019m thinking your dad and her in laws may have berated her for having a daughter (which is technically dads fault because of chromosomes) and her upbringing.", "NTA, the mother is someone you will never make happy, and thats not your fault. Growing up and be told your worthless is a horrible childhood in my opinion. Im glad u finally stood up for yourself. It will be difficult to break away from her, but that might be best for you. Get away from the toxic family, make your own (even with friends) and be happy.", "NTA and also r/raisedbynarcissists\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve gone through that. If you can find a way to move away from your family and go low or even no-contact, you will find yourself feeling more free than you ever thought you could. \n\nGood luck to you", "NTA just because she raised you doesn\u2019t mean you owe her the earth, she treats you like shit.", "NTA. You are living in an abusive home. If you can afford to, get out as soon as possible. Traditions also include a mother treating their child with some semblance of love.   \nI am sorry you are going through this.", "NTA it will never get better. You need to move out and go No Contact with your sexist, toxic family. I'm sorry they put you through a life of misery. Really piss them off and find a nice guy of a different Race lol\nYou don't owe them anything", "It's really sad how those extreme levels of sexism are kept going by women like your mom, and not just by men. Really goes to show that different individuals are good or bad regardless of gender, even in settings where one gender is the favored one.\n\nAnyway, NTA. Your mom is abusive and you deserve better.", "NTA so doing the legal bare minimum of taking responsibility for your own actions deserves kindness does it?  So when will I start recieving a check for not robbing banks?  Your mother made it clear she doesn't view you as her child through her actions, so No she does not deserve for you to be gentle or kind to her.  Treat Others as You Wish to Be Treated goes BOTH WAYS the way your mother treated you throughout your life is how she WISHES TO BE TREATED.", "Start saving now.  Nursing homes cost about $5000 a month where I live, and I live in a low cost of living area.  So start saving up now!!!", "NTA.  As soon as you're able, leave.  Your perfect little brother will surely give her everything she ever needed and wanted.\n\nYou can live your life on your terms, without her venom.", "NTA just came to reiterate that you are a good person with a good heart who deserves good things, such as moving away from your family and determining the course of your own life, for starters. There was never anything wrong with you\u2014the failure is your mother. She failed to advocate for you, a helpless infant at the time, and she continued to fail you as you grew. She reflected her traumas and her hateful thinking onto you. You still grew up to be a kind and compassionate adult, which is not to her credit and is in fact despite her.\n\nI get that none of the terrible things she did to you are from a neutral experience\u2014she had to have been traumatized by similar hatefulness to become this way, but when she started traumatizing you, you were a helpless infant and child. She could have chosen to be kinder to you, or to try to heal herself. Not easily, but she could have chosen. She was your parent; your mother, who should nurture, protect and love you. Now you are grown, she is just a peer. She forfeits her right to your respect through verbally abusing you and mentally torturing you. The reason you have never met her standards is NOT that you are lacking. The reason is that she decided long ago that you will never meet her standards, hence them changing from \u2018auggh get a job and contribute to this family!\u2019 To, \u2018auggh you work too much and never help me!\u2019\n\nI know we live in very different parts of the world culturally and legally, but if you are able please get away from this toxic woman. If you have the kind of job where you can ask to transfer to a different location, for sure initiate that. Ask if there are any resources in your area to help you relocate. See if you have a girl cousin or friend who wants to try moving to the next town with you. Ask a former teacher maybe if there are resources in your area to help young women pay for college/housing. You deserve a life out from under this woman\u2019s hateful influence and I know you can make it happen. It may take a bit, but as others have said the first step is to find out how to get and keep your wages separate from the household finances and where only you will have access, if that isn\u2019t already the case and if it\u2019s possible where you are. Good luck, I\u2019m pulling for you and proud of you!  Sincerely, a lady old enough to be your mom.", "There's no fault *attached* to being a girl. I know you mean well but your comment reinforces that toxic patriarchal crap.", "Most of these options aren't available in India.", "The fuck are you on about? What exactly did op\u2019s mother sacrifice? Her \u201cperfect\u201d life of having a son first?? Her mother straight up told her she\u2019s not loved in the family and you\u2019re trying to defend that? Oh sure, her mother may have \u201craised\u201d her (from what I\u2019ve read out of spite). Congrats, op\u2019s mom did the bare necessity for having a child, keeping them alive. To me it really sounds like you\u2019re op\u2019s mother just trying to make yourself feel better.", "Oh cry me a river and sail down it. She did the bare minimum as a parent.", "third this", "This! I would honestly cut contact with her if I were you, but it is your choice.\n\nHonestly? If she hates you so much and loves your brother that much more, she can let him decide where she goes. If he also turns against her for being a horrible woman? Well, she made that bed and will have to lie in it.", "Go for a J-1 visa, a lot of jobs in the US, most include transportation."]}
