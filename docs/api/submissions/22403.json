{"id": 22403, "submission_id": "151cqtm", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I hate her and will be putting her in a nursing home to rot?", "selftext": "I come from an extremely traditional Indian family where women are seen less inferior than men. I\u2019m the oldest daughter, so my mother has always resented me for being born as a female and \u201cruining\u201d her life since she had hoped for a boy. I\u2019m 20 now, but my mother finally got her wish a few years ago and gave birth to my now 8 year old brother. However, she treats me terribly compared to him. And I know that comparing myself to a 8 year old is bad, but ever since I was a child she\u2019s always told me how useless I am and how I should just leave home and get married or run away with some man so she never has to see me again. I\u2019ve always tolerated what she says because of filial piety but yesterday she really started getting on my nerves. I had just gotten home from work when she started to yell at me for never helping her with anything (She always likes to exaggerate as when in reality I do everything at her beck and call) and how she wishes for me to move out already (I\u2019m on summer vacation from college and don\u2019t have a place of my own). She was complaining about how she had to clean the house on her own while I was working. I don\u2019t understand, because it was her that used to scream at me for being jobless and not helping her pay bills. Now that I have a job it becomes my fault for not being at home to help her clean and cook. I tried to reason with her, but she got angrier and then began to tell me how unloved I am in this family and how she\u2019s never loved me. I was tired from working, and already sick of her attitude so I ended up lashing out at her for the first time in my life and told her that I hate her and have never seen her as my mother. I also said that she will end up in a nursing home considering how she\u2019s already so old and my younger brother is incapable of taking care of her at his age. She so got angry she kicked me out, so now I\u2019m staying at my cousin\u2019s house. However, my cousin\u2019s family is telling me I was in the wrong and that I should be gentle with my mother since she is the one who raised me (even if it was without love). I see posts like this on tiktok a lot and really wanted outsider opinions on my situation.

You didn't choose to be born and require food, shelter, etc. from your parents. You owe them nothing in return for them choosing to have you and then raising you.", "NTA OP. But first, you are not useless, you never were. Her behavior is a projection of her feelings towards herself and she is just using you as a scapegoat. I am sorry you have a mother like that but I can hear your inner  strength from the words you wrote. One day you will be able to leave this behind and have your own family and you will realize how awesome you were always.", "NTA - so sorry to hear that you have been living with such toxicity.  Your mother's behaviour towards you is despicable.", "NTA - she got exactly what she deserved, even if it was overdue. \n\nFilial piety gets people, especially women, killed. Period.", "NTA your mom sounds terrible and rotting in a nursing home is a small penance for what she has put you through for your entire life. You owe nothing to your mom, she decided to have a child and owed it to you to raise and support you. She should never have had a child in the first place.", "I will never understand cultures which insist that this person or that person deserves unconditional respect and our unconditional obedience and we are awful people by holding them accountable for their shitty actions.  Life just doesn't work that way.\n\nYou need to acknowledge that you are a good person with a good heart and are deserving of good things and your mom is not a good person and does not have a good heart.  Your life would be better off if you moved out and cut contact with your mom.  Don't even say anything to her.  Just stop talking to her.  Ignore her.  Make sure your money goes into bank accounts that are in your name only and your family can't access.  Look for places you can move to and just do it.  In the mean time start packing up your most important possessions and storing them at a friends place until you are ready to move.\n\nNTA", "No. Maybe not the best choice of words, but I don't feel you ATA. Best of luck to you honey though. Finish your studies & show her how smart & great you truly are.

Unfortunately, trails and vapours of that same toxic culture have seeped into your cousin's house too.\n\nI'm from Malaysia, and I mostly disavow traditional Asian culture. I pick and choose a mix of Western freedom, and incorporate some good Eastern principles that help, while also following my Christian heritage. However, I am of course well aware that traditional Asian households that fully ignore Western ideals can make life REALLY miserable for daughters - and I've heard of it, seen it, and tried to help girls whose own parents made them feel rejected just for being a daughter.\n\nYou're no AH. I say, you are NTA. Definitely, conclusively and fully NTA. However, allow me to commend you that you are a strong, brave and courageous young lady who dares to speak her mind. Now that you are no longer silent, do not ever fall silent again! Stride forth and speak without fear! Your future will be bright, as long as you have the courage to walk towards it with confidence.", "NTA- but you once you gain financial independence you can have the adult conversation about your treatment as a child. You can point out to your family, that you offered an nursing home over letting her die on the street. A nursing home will give her the level of love and support she has given to you, nothing more, nothing less.", "NTA\n\n\"Putting\" her in a nursing home is more than you need to do.

Normally I would say otherwise but damn.", "Girl , I know how this feels , I'm an Indian too but don't listen to your mother or your cousin's mother. It's not your fault you are a girl. If I was you , I would definitely report her for mental abuse or at least move out of the house. Because never stay somewhere where you are not valued .", "Oh, honey. NTA. A human can only take so much abuse before they crack in one direction or another. Please do whatever you can to get yourself living elsewhere and don't worry about what happens to your mother after that. If your cousins or other extended family tell you to go back home and take care of her, tell them to go do it themselves. They're not the ones who were raised by her abuse. It sounds like you and your mother are both victims of a long and complex tradition of misogyny and you have an opportunity to break the chain and you should be proud of yourself.

Far too many times parents financially abuse their children. OP do not give your mom any of your money, ever.
