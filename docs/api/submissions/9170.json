Except for one issue\u2014her camera roll. \n\nFor background, she dated a guy for four years in high school and the first half of college. She broke up with him last year, and has dated other people since then, leading up to me. She never really talks about him, unless telling a past story about her friend group (which he was a part of until he suddenly up and left). According to her, the reason they broke up is she realized they were on two different levels of maturity (when I mean she\u2019s intelligent I mean she\u2019s well known around campus and every professor adores her, and we go to a Big 12 university). She also got life threateningly sick and, while he was worried for her, she knew he wouldn\u2019t be responsible enough to take care of her in the future (progressive heart disease). They ended on good terms, but don\u2019t talk anymore because he is kind of an introverted guy according to her.\n\nThe part I get upset about is every time she opens her camera roll to show me a past picture she scrolls past photos or videos of him and her.

These photos and videos of him and her aren\u2019t romantic, they\u2019re high school shenanigans and usually involve her other friends, but I still can\u2019t help but feel jealous.\n\nToday she showed me a photo of her friends in 2018, telling me a funny story. He\u2019s in the photo. I said \u201cyou have a lot of pictures with him\u201d in an annoyed tone, and she said \u201cwell yeah, he grew up with me and my friends. We were kids together. It\u2019s like a look back into my childhood.\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t like those pictures, and she offered to remove them and put them on a drive. I told her that wasn\u2019t enough. She told me they were precious memories she shared with her friends and she wasn\u2019t going to delete them just because he was in a couple. I kinda raised my voice and told her she should go back to him if the memories were \u201cprecious\u201d. She got up and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to him, but I also don\u2019t want to be with someone who is emotionally insecure, I have enough to deal with\u201d and then left.\n\nI\u2019ve debated on texting her and apologizing.

Solving your immaturity issues and your jealousy is your job, not hers. She shouldn't have to get rid of pictures because you don't know how to manage your emotions.\n\nAnd then what you said to her about going back to him was manipulative and disgusting.\n\nI hope she sees this as the red flag it absolutely is.", "YTA.

People were people before they met you. This may be shocking, but your parents also had a different life before you were born. Your presence in someone\u2019s life doesn\u2019t mean you get to dictate how they remember what it was like before you. It\u2019s not like they are racy pictures.

It's okay to have and hold onto memories through photos.", "YTA and erasing the photos won\u2019t erase the past and even if it could why would you want to?

She\u2019s your girlfriend. You want her to get rid of past memories with her friends just because someone who she used to date is in them? If the pics were of just them being romantic, maybe it would be different. You are VERY emotionally insecure. You don\u2019t see yourself as good of a person as your perception of him is and you\u2019re threatened by group photos of someone you\u2019ve never met from 4 years ago. Yikes. Go grovel and hope she takes you back, but I\u2019m lowkey hoping she finds someone more secure if she\u2019s as amazing as you describe.", "YTA. She offered to put them on another drive and that wasn\u2019t good enough. Immature.\n\nTelling someone to change something important to them for your emotional insecurities. Immature.\n\nChill dude. You\u2019re not a bad person. I get jealous too.", "yes YTA, Old photos of her childhood and all her friends? You are free to not like them which would mean asking her not to show you old pictures anymore if they have her ex in them. But it's not fair to want her to delete all her old photos just because she isn't with that guy anymore. I am old so I don't have thousands of digital photos of my exes but I do have some old physical photos and I would never throw them away. Those are part of my life. Her having old pictures doesn't mean she wants to go back to the other guy.\n\nYelling at her was out of line. You are acting immature and insecure, in my opinion. You should apologize and work on your issues to not be so threatened by the fact she lived a life for many years before she met you.", "YTA, she offered to move them to a separate disk and that wasn\u2019t even enough for you?  Definitely insecure and immature.", "YTA- why would she delete photos with friends?", "YTA you are getting jealous over pictures of the past and a guy she isn't with anymore get over it and realize that she isn't with him anymore", "YTA.
