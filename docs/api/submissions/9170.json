{"id": 9170, "submission_id": "10u1ai6", "title": "AITA for yelling at my gf due to her camera roll?", "selftext": "UPDATE: I texted her this morning and I apologized for crossing a line. She said while she accepted the apology, the relationship wouldn\u2019t be continuing any further. She said a lack of self-awareness and emotional maturity is not something she can overlook when dating someone. So I guess I\u2019m single now.\n\nMe (23M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together for four months now. She\u2019s great. Beautiful, crazy intelligent, and has the best personality. Genuinely my dream girl. Except for one issue\u2014her camera roll. \n\nFor background, she dated a guy for four years in high school and the first half of college. She broke up with him last year, and has dated other people since then, leading up to me. She never really talks about him, unless telling a past story about her friend group (which he was a part of until he suddenly up and left). According to her, the reason they broke up is she realized they were on two different levels of maturity (when I mean she\u2019s intelligent I mean she\u2019s well known around campus and every professor adores her, and we go to a Big 12 university). She also got life threateningly sick and, while he was worried for her, she knew he wouldn\u2019t be responsible enough to take care of her in the future (progressive heart disease). They ended on good terms, but don\u2019t talk anymore because he is kind of an introverted guy according to her.\n\nThe part I get upset about is every time she opens her camera roll to show me a past picture she scrolls past photos or videos of him and her. I\u2019ve brought this up to her before, and she always laughs and says it\u2019s because she\u2019s too lazy to go through 30k photos (she hasn\u2019t deleted pictures since 2015). These photos and videos of him and her aren\u2019t romantic, they\u2019re high school shenanigans and usually involve her other friends, but I still can\u2019t help but feel jealous.\n\nToday she showed me a photo of her friends in 2018, telling me a funny story. He\u2019s in the photo. I said \u201cyou have a lot of pictures with him\u201d in an annoyed tone, and she said \u201cwell yeah, he grew up with me and my friends. We were kids together. It\u2019s like a look back into my childhood.\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t like those pictures, and she offered to remove them and put them on a drive. I told her that wasn\u2019t enough. She told me they were precious memories she shared with her friends and she wasn\u2019t going to delete them just because he was in a couple. I kinda raised my voice and told her she should go back to him if the memories were \u201cprecious\u201d. She got up and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to him, but I also don\u2019t want to be with someone who is emotionally insecure, I have enough to deal with\u201d and then left.\n\nI\u2019ve debated on texting her and apologizing.

She\u2019s your girlfriend. You want her to get rid of past memories with her friends just because someone who she used to date is in them? If the pics were of just them being romantic, maybe it would be different. You are VERY emotionally insecure. You don\u2019t see yourself as good of a person as your perception of him is and you\u2019re threatened by group photos of someone you\u2019ve never met from 4 years ago. Yikes.

You are free to not like them which would mean asking her not to show you old pictures anymore if they have her ex in them. But it's not fair to want her to delete all her old photos just because she isn't with that guy anymore. I am old so I don't have thousands of digital photos of my exes but I do have some old physical photos and I would never throw them away. Those are part of my life. Her having old pictures doesn't mean she wants to go back to the other guy.\n\nYelling at her was out of line. You are acting immature and insecure, in my opinion.

But you\u2019re fucking that reality up, despite her right to a \u201cpast life\u201d and her very reasonable explanation.", "YTA-did you forget that she was a whole entire person separate from you and had a life before she met you?", "YTA... Insecure about somebody having a life before you and hating the fact they look back on it fondly.", "You\u2019re an idiot. YTA.", " I don\u2019t think he\u2019s realised he\u2019s been dumped.", "YTA. They are from her past. Don't ask her to delete her past.", "YTA-Those could of been the best moments or her childhood. I only wish I had that many photos. Apologies. Should be clear her feelings for you. She's just sentimental.", "YTA. You wanted an intelligent mature woman who is coming to terms with having a progressive heart disease to eradicate her past for someone she has been with for a whole four months.  She offered to save them on a hard drive so you would not see them and that was not enough for you. \n\n She left her long term boyfriend because she felt he would not be responsible enough. With the level in childish insecurity that you displayed what makes you think you two are still a couple.", "YTA.\n\nIts funny to be racist?", "\nExactly, YTA OP.  It is selfish and controlling on your part. This insecure behavior is going to drive her away soon or later. I\u2019m glad that she responded the way she did and I hope you don\u2019t wear her down like my ex did to me. \n\nMy ex made me do this. I deleted hundreds, maybe a thousand pictures from years of high school and the first couple years of college. There have been many times over the years  that I wish I could look back at photos of hangout and trips that just so happened to have him in them.\n\nI wish the relationship ended when that red flag was waving.\n\nEdit: I thought I\u2019d add these comments that my ex (25m) told me (19f) at the time:\n\n- \u201cI don\u2019t get why you even want photos like those\u201d \n- \u201ctrust me, you won\u2019t care about those hs photos\u201d \n- \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense for you to want photos of your ex-boyfriend.\u201d\n- \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense why you need these photos so much\u201d \n- \u201cit seems weird that you are so attached to those photos.\u201d \n\nI have literally never once missed those photos because I wanted to lust over my ex-bf. Not once.\n\nAlso, OP in my experience, my ex didn\u2019t delete*his* photos and cheated on me with an ex. So this seems like it could be projection.", "I can't believe he managed to write all of that out and not realize that himself.", "Yep.\n\nI still have photos of my ex on my computer. I don\u2019t look back through them but there\u2019s also nothing pressing to make me delete them. He was a major part of my life for 3 years.\n\nI\u2019ve now been with my husband for nearly 11 years and not once has he ever given a single fuck. Not even when the relationship was brand new. Not even through our rough patches.\n\nWhy? Because he knows that I\u2019m his and he\u2019s mine and that\u2019s all there is to it.", "If OP wanted her back, he should be begging on his knees, and also truly understanding why he's wrong. She's too smart to fall for fake apologies.", "Not even for someone she knows for ages. Those are her memories, her life.", "I think he already is.", "Hey, she is fond of her past memories which clearly means she wants her old boyfriend back. Just like how I want to return to high-school because I liked some of my teachers and date whoever it was I was dating them because the cafeteria made these awesome cookies. Because you can't be fond of memories without wanting everything in your life to return to how it was then.", "She dumped the last boyfriend because she thought he was too immature. This boyfriend just outed himself as the same.\n\nYTA", "She told him she doesn\u2019t want to be with him before she left. That\u2019s her dumping him.", "Poor thing has a ways to go before guys her age mature.", "YTA and she's definitely your ex gf now", "i wouldn't delete my entire camera roll of high school memories for someone i'd been dating for 4 months, either.  plus she had a life threatening illness, not to sound morbid, but if anything happened to her, her friends and family would be glad to have those pictures.  YTA", "This has to be fake, right? Nobody is this foolish? \n\nJIC it's not. YTA. For all the reasons she said. If she takes you back, which I'm not sure she should, maybe think about the fact that she's with you and not him and stop obsessing over nonsense. If she wanted to be with him, she would be. Instead, she's trying to share her cherished memories with YOU. For some reason, because it's clearly not because you care about them and want to know more about her. \n\nYou need to grow up, fast, or this will be over before it's even really begun. The only saving grace here is that you're young, 23 and 21 is still very early. But as a heads up, yeah. This is really gross behavior and NO woman wants to deal with it. Or you, if you keep it up. That's on you, not them.", "YTA. This is her history. You may not like it but you have to accept her past. Get over yourself and accept that she dated somebody else before she met you.\n\nIf I had to guess you are probably scared of a break up or anything. While this is somewhat normal you should accept her and her past.", "YTA Well, here we have someone else not on the same maturity level as her.  Come on dude, she dated him. It did happen.  You're jealous of pictures.  I guarantee eventually she is going to end up with a guy who doesn't care she has pictures of you in her camera roll.", "So this massively intelligent woman left a guy that was a huge part of her whole childhood because of maturity issues. And then you act like this. I bet you don't have a girlfriend anymore dude.", "YTA. You have to take responsibility for your own emotions....not yell at other people to get them to do what you want so you can feel ok. \n\nTrying to regulate your emotions by controlling other people is an abusive response, and as a person of privilege, you have a responsibility to keep such behavior in check. \n\nBut you didn't. So YTA.", "YTA it\u2019s group photos it\u2019s not like she\u2019s looking at other guys and at least they\u2019re not naked or nsfw photos", "YTA. She left the ex because he wasn\u2019t mature enough for her. You\u2019re making him look steady as a rock.", "She truly is smart. YTA.", "YTA, and just proved to your perfect (ex) girlfriend that you are not emotionally mature enough for her.", "YTA. You can't delete one's past. Grow up and accept her as she is, with her history.", "YTA. Geez. Jealous of her past? You sound controlling. They\u2019re just photos. You do sound emotionally insecure.", "You are a flaming AH. \n\nYour insecurity and lack of maturity doesn't translate to permission to control another person and their childhood memories. \n\nGet over yourself. You're afraid of losing this girl to the guy *she left* and your unreasonable response to her pictures will see her leaving your ass. Not to go back to the guy in the pictures, but to whomever isn't an insecure chump.", "YTA she's right you're immature and insecure. Work on yourself before you try a relationship with anyone.", "YTA. She doesn't love the guy anymore, she's with you now (although she probably won't be anymore unless you apologize to her in person). Does she refer to him constantly when you're together especially fondly? No? Then you have nothing to worry about, that's just your anxiety and insecurity talking. Get off Reddit and go to her to say sorry before it's too late.", "YTA She's too good for you and now she knows it.", "YTA. My mother in law has one of those digital picture frames in her house. And it has thousands and thousands of pictures. There\u2019s like 2 or 3 that have my husbands ex girlfriend in family pictures with his grandparents or like old Christmas pics. One day one popped up when I was there and my mother in law freaked out apologizing, saying she would try to find it on her laptop and delete it. I told her not to bother or worry, the picture wasn\u2019t about them it was about that memory of the entire family together and she just happened to be in it. I\u2019m married to him and very close to the family I\u2019m not worried at all about a couple pictures. And it\u2019s one of the last ones with his grandparents. Grow up. Your the one with her those pictures hold memories deeper than him and her being in it together.", "Grow up. Dont screw this up.. So she had a life before you.  You also had a life before her  You are going to mess this up.  Don't be jealous over pictures.", "YTA   and this girl is WWWWAAAYYYY out of your league.  You are WAY to possessive and controlling and apparently you showed her your true colors.  You'll need more than an apology to repair the damage you've done.  Does your college offer any sort of mental health resources?  You need to figure out why you are so obsessed with her ex, OWN your own emotional health problem, sincerely apologize, and promise that it won't happen again.", "I\u2019m super impressed with your (ex?) girlfriend\u2019s response about not wanting to be with someone emotionally insecure. \n\nI wish all young women her age had such empowerment when responding to controlling assholes like you. \n\nYTA - stop dating until you can learn to be a non-controlling, insecure asshole.", "YTA. The insecurity is strong in this one", "You want someone to erase all these photos from their past for a 4 month relationship? LOL please don't apologise, she might take you back out of pity. \n\nYTA", "YTA and way too jealous. He was important for many years and probably still is. It's normal. Instead of being jealous offer to back up those photos for her and put them on a thumb drive so she can always have them but also have space on her phone.", "YTA", "You blew it with this girl you clearly like a lot, over innocent pics. Probably wasn't your best string of decisions. YTA", "When someone has a high school sweetheart you can\u2019t just delete every pic with them.

YTA", "\"I am jealous about non-romantic pictures of an ex on a camera with thousands of undeleted pictures. AITA?\"\n\nI think you already know the answer to that question, fam.\n\nYTA. You gonna lose your \"dream\" partner because the idea of her reminiscing about past friendships/relationships is too much for you to handle. You get how insane that sounds, right?", "Yta. She didn't live in a bubble before she met you. She's not displaying them on the mantle. She has them in HER phone. \nShe's with you, but won't be for long if you keep it up.", "YTA. It is perfectly normal to have some pictures of your exes. My mom has loads of photo albums from when she was younger and was travelling and living with her ex. Having them on a drive should be a perfectly acceptable compromise. \nYou seem extremely possessive and insecure. Demanding her to erase her memories especially when you\u2019ve only been together for 4 months is very controlling.", "Dude. Get therapy. These levels of jealousy are something that you need to work on--you can't expect other people to fix things for you. \n\n>I kinda raised my voice and told her she should go back to him\n\nHopefully she sees this as the red flag that it is and listens to it. YTA.", "YTA. How immature was her ex, if you\u2019re the upgrade?", "Sorry dude YTA. If she had an album dedicated to romantic pictures of them together that would be one thing as it's a sign she hasn't moved on. But her having a pictures of her childhood that include him because he was also there that's not something to get jealous of. Maybe be jealous of her apparently happy childhood. But romantically jealous. That's a bit much all things considered.", "YTA\n\nHow insecure are you?  If you are that insecure you need to find yourself a girl who's never had a boyfriend or been friends with a boy, or had a crush on a boy band member.\n\nHe is her ex. He is her ex for a reason. He's history. You have no right to expect her to destroy all her photos and videos just because you are insecure. He was a member of her friends group, so yes he's going to be in pictures.", "YTA. These are her memories, what right do you have to try to erase that??", "I've said it once I'll say it a thousand times. The number before you is infinitely less important than the number after you lol.\n\nIn all seriousness unless you date a deaf blind mute who has been locked in a room by themselves their whole lives they are going to have at the bare minimum looked at another human and fantasized. Grow up Yta", "She broke up with him for being immature\n\nYou then proceed to be immature.\n\nGood job, I can tell you thought that one through.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019ve been here before. My girlfriend was very adamant that I had no photos with any of my exes in them, even if they weren\u2019t romantic or they were some of the only photos with my late cat I grew up with. I now call her my ex girlfriend and it\u2019s the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. YTA, she shouldn\u2019t be carrying your insecurities.", "YTA jesus christ dude, get a grip", "YTA you have issues and big insecurities that was her friend before he was her boyfriend", "YTA\n\nThose are her memories of things she wants to look back on and remember.  It has NOTHING to do with you.  You do need to get more secure, being an asshole because you're afraid she's going to leave you is setting yourself up that she'll leave you. Grow up and start making your own memories with her.", "I\u2019d understand deleting photos of only them two. But demanding deleting the group photos is harsh.", "Very clearly YTA. \nWhy is putting all those pictures in a drive not enough for you?\nWhat about the memories in her brain? You want to delete that too? Apologize to her before it is too late.", "YTA. I sincerely hope your gf follows through with what she said. You need to work on your insecurities, it's ruining/ruined your relationship", "YTA", "YTA your gf needs a new bf since your maturity level is not the same level as hers", "I'd be curious if OP has any photos of any of his ex's saved anywhere.  I can understand not wanting to have her constantly pulling up photos of her ex all the time, but deleting them seems completely unnecessary.  Just saved them away somewhere.", "YTA - and she is not your girlfriend anymore lol", "YTA. And insecure. One you dont yell at people, grow up. Two, her childhood memories ARE precious to her and should be cherished. Hes a part of her childhood. That's it. Your being insecure and jealous of a photo. Keep this up and you wont be a part of her future.", "YTA. \n\nGod I hope she dumps you.", "YTA. And super insecure. You really expect someone to just delete their whole life up until they met you? Sounds like you\u2019re not mature enough for her either", "YTA \n\n>(she hasn\u2019t deleted pictures since 2015)\n\n>30k photos\n\n>he grew up with me and my friends.\n\nYou want her to sort through thousands of images and strategically remove photos of childhood memories because you feel insecure?", "YTA.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Who expects someone to delete all their photos just because their in a new relationship?  She already gave you a perfectly good compromise by suggesting to put those photos with him in a separate flash drive, which is already more than she should need to.  You yourself said they weren't romantic in nature, and some predated them even dating.  It's not like they were nudes or sex videos, I could understand if you were uncomfortable about her keeping those after a relationship ended.\n\n\nYou are too jealous. She's right, you are too emotionally immature if you can't handle occasionally seeing an old photo of a friend that she dated for a while.", "Ew yta.", "Good for her to call you out on your insecurity and not dealing with it anymore. I\u2019m hoping she keeps this up and not take you back. You\u2019re obviously not ready for a relationship.\n\nYTA", "YTA, grow up. She had a life before you and those photos are apart of that life.

Man I don\u2019t want to be a guys guy or whatever, but please grow a set of balls, just a little bit of self respect and manhood would go a long way. A tiny bit of confidence my man.

It's not like they were romantic photos of just the two of them together.

You don't get to erase those things.\n\nWhen we were 24 and had been together a bit over a year, the man I went on to marry told me some brief anecdote, as he sometimes did, about his relationship with his ex before me, who was also an online acquaintance of mine as we ran in the same online circles.  He then put on a facial expression I will never forget, and apologized to me, saying he needs to stop \"bringing her up so much.\"  He thought he was being unfair to me.\n\nI stopped him.  I told him I disagreed.  He was 24 years old and he'd been with her for 4 years of his life, so a pretty high percentage of it, certainly a high percentage of his *remembered* life.  I told him that a lot of who he was as a partner that I liked so much, he'd learned and refined while with her.  That while I didn't really approve of what ultimately lead to their breakup, I did not think she was any kind of terrible person and I had no issues with her and she was in no way going to be a forbidden topic so long as there are no insulting comparisons involved - and there never had been.  I told him that while I did not and would not pry, I also did not expect him to hide away his life experiences, especially such formative ones, and pretend they never happened.  That these were things which inform, well, as I said above, who he is and who he wants to be.  And I *liked* that person.\n\nIf anything he was being unfair to *himself* by thinking he needed to lock all of that away and never think on it or bring it up, and feeling unnecessarily guilty over it.  And this kind of thing has a way of becoming self-reinforcing.  That way lies self-sabotage.\n\nI asked him not to do that to himself for my sake, in my name, as I would *not* appreciate that.  *That's* what I would find offensive.\n\nHe listened.  He believed that I meant what I said.  And he relaxed and let go of the guilt over still sometimes thinking about her.  Of *course* he still thought about her sometimes, it hadn't all been that long ago and she'd been a big part of a large chunk of his life.  She naturally comes up *far* less often these days, hardly at all.  Because, well, time passes.  And now the bulk of his learning and growing as an adult and as a partner has been together with me.  She's just not as big a part, but it still doesn't mean that the time he spent with her doesn't matter.\n\n\nYou wanted her to erase from her photos and her memory a childhood friend and longterm partner?  Someone with whom she shared formative experiences?  Someone whom she learned and grew with?  And from whom she eventually moved on when they were no longer in the same place in life, because they'd matured differently?

No doubt she knows her worth and won\u2019t put up with shit!", "I like her...\n\nShe amicably ended things with her previous BF because she saw he wasn't mature enough, specially considering her heart condition.\n\nThen OP showed himself to a insecure and immature child, and she ended things with him as well.\n\nI'm happy for her.", "Whahhhh??? I mean, the guy is here and asking. Let's support him being better. He needs to not date till getting his shush together but, he's young. Be better than those you chide.", "yea I just feel bad for him. i mean looking at the greater picture he jealous because he loves her and see a future with her, maybe if he improve his own maturity she will take him back down the line.", "For example, lot of people on the spectrum like me, often don't understand sarcasm or some types of sarcasm, especially deadpan can be hard to some. Sometimes it may be obvious to me but sometimes I would've never realized. :)\n\nAlso if growing in an environment lacking in sarcasm, that doesn't help for recognizing it. The /s really helps in some cases lol. Also, that usually if it's sarcasm the other comments show it to be true. :D Then to add language barriers, recognizing sarcasm in a non-native language is not always easy either.\n\n*I reckon you knew people have these sort of difficulties but I've seen many people lately wondering why people don't get it (not sure if serious or not) so decided to give a take on it if it would help someone*.\n\nHave a nice day :)", "My Ex Husband was jealous of pictures of two of my exs.\n\nOne ex was gay and dead.\n\nOne ex was just dead.\n\nLiterally my EX Husband had no reason to be jealous of these people.  Like I can't even fathom how he was mad about me having pictures of two dead people in my home. \n\n  \nMy EX husband threw away boxes and boxes of old school paper printed photos of people I loved either as friends or dated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's my EX Husband for a reason.\n\n  \nYou're a tremendous giant asshole.", "I like this girl. She knows what she wants and doesn\u2019t settle for any bullshit", "I am so proud of your ex gf. That is so hard to do and really really shows her emotional maturity. Try to take this as a learning experience and become more self aware and emotionally mature. For instance, if you feel those feelings of jealousy, instead of lashing out, just express your feelings honestly and look for a solution together. Good luck in the future!", "YTA. and reading your update, good for her", "You\u2019re single now? I love that for your ex. YTA", "Sorry she is right, you are jealous, which can make a beautiful person become ugly on many levels", "I\u2019m afraid I must agree with the masses on this one. Nothing in what you\u2019ve described indicates any type of infidelity, but rather that you may feel threatened by the bond and memories they shared. \n\nIf she were sneaking out at night to be with him, and had no believable explanation, that would be one thing. If she were consistently breaking off plans with you to be with him, I could understand your concern. But they\u2019re just pictures\u2014 ones which remind her of her golden past, and perhaps even a piece of herself.\n\nIf you feel threatened by that, I feel she did absolutely the right thing by breaking up with you. \n\nMy humble suggestion for you would be to do some real soul searching to find out why something as benign as past photos of her with another guy bother you so much. Do this before jumping into another romantic relationship, if your goal is to become more \u201cemotionally mature.\u201d\n\nGood luck.\n\n#YTA", "YTA!\n\nGrow up - sooner versus later.", "Women aren't Barbies to be kept pristine in a box until you decide to take it out and play.  I'm sorry you lost your perfect little trophy, but you never had her for who she is because you never bothered to find out who that is. You never allowed her to share her past with you and that is what made her.", "YTA\nI was with you until she offered to put them on a drive to store them and you said it wasn't good enough. This is her past. Don't expect her to delete her past.\n\nYou're emotionally insecure.", "YTA. You're not mature enough for a relationship if this is bothering you so much. Let her go.", "I hope OP has learned a valuable lesson about boundaries and jealousy from this experience.", "YTA.  I would have broken up with OP too.  Been seeing her for four months and wants her to delete years of her life.  Rather than taking your insecurity out on people, work on yourself and learn from this experience.", "I don't think she's your gf anymore. At least I hope not. You sound exhausting. YTA.", "Heaven forbid he get together with someone who has a child. What will he make them do with the child?", "That's horrid :( Have you been able to get any copies of those photos back from your friends who you shared the trip with? I really recommend reaching out even if you haven't been in touch for a few years, asking if they can send you pictures from the time - I'm sure people will be happy to forward you pictures of happy memories you shared.", "The poor dear is an immaturity magnet. So sad.", "He\u2019s gonna take that as a sign that he has no blame and she ran away watch \ud83d\ude44", "It's okay, EX-GF has a good head on her shoulders and is mentally strong. She dumped him.", "Which was the right thing to do.", "I read that and I don\u2019t even know her and I\u2019m proud of her! That is awesome that she\u2019s that emotionally mature and aware.", "I\u2019m in awe of her self-assurance/confidence/whatever at 21. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have recognized this for the red flag that it is when I was 21. Probably not even when I was 31.", "I just got here, read the update, knew it was gonna be good, read through it and cackled. I hope she finds this and has a good laugh too. Cheers to her, love her \ud83e\udd42", "Well said! I can\u2019t even imagine trying to pick up on sarcasm in a different language \ud83d\ude2c", "Omg, she sounds AMAZING.\n\nMan,  you screwed up.  Pathetic really.", "YTA for sure. These are group photos of all of her high school friends. I saw your update. I hope you will work on your insecurities for future relationships.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou really going to need to work on that jealousy it is not attractive all. Woman like a confident man and right now your insecurities about pictures that are NOT EVEN ROMANTIC will end up killing your relationship(s)  \n\n\nEDIT  \n\n\nI see she dumped you. You are right in one thing...she is very intelligent. She realized there was no point in going further with someone who is acting in this manner.   \n\n\nAlso you TEXTED an apology....how LAME.", "She\u2019s right for breaking up with you. Don\u2019t wallow in self-pity, work on improving yourself and being secure both by yourself and in relationships.", "YTA. She is better off without you. Grow up a bit and good luck with your next relationship.", "Well, hopefully this was a teachable moment.\nThis was about your insecurity and immaturity, and hopefully you can learn from it.\nFind ways to build confidence, maybe even seek therapy, and you should be OK.", "sorry OP, there might still be a chance if you can improve on your own maturity, also kind of feel bad for you even though it was one mistake.", "Devil\u2019s Advocate here: are you valid for having feelings, despite them being right or wrong? Yes, you\u2019re valid for feeling a way. Did you communicate and handle said feelings properly? Definitely not. \n\nFor everyone here belittling OP for being insecure, most people are. But there\u2019s also a big difference between toxic insecurity and jealousy, and harmless insecurity and jealousy. \n\nHarmless: \u201cHey, scrolling through hundreds of photos of a past lover every time you tell a story makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019m srry, I realize that\u2019s silly, but what if you just put them in a special album so we don\u2019t have to go through them every day?\u201d \n\nHer willingness to put them all on a drive was huge\u2014 out of sight out of mind, everyone wins. But to ask her to completely *erase* these memories from her life is TOXIC behavior; it\u2019s not healthy nor harmless. It\u2019s controlling and definitely makes YTA.\n\nThere are certain sensitivities that wouldn\u2019t kill us to acknowledge with new love. I have my photos, gifts, etc., in a special place i.e. I wouldn\u2019t try to share them with my partner with every story I told.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t love scrolling through all those pics either, despite how \u201cstupid\u201d I was for feeling that way; after all, we are human at the end of the day. I also believe you could be the most secure person in the world (whatever that is), yet still feel weird when having to see or think of your loved one with someone else. It sounds like OP endured this on a consistent basis and that\u2019s why bashing him for his insecurities seems harsh. \n\nN T A had you communicated your feelings in an honest, vulnerable, and healthy way. Unfortunately you chose the toxic controlling route and it cost you a lot more than deleted photos.", "I agree a bit tbh, I\u2019ll be uncomfortable if someone I\u2019m dating had so many photos with their ex saved on their phone especially if they went through the photos so much. But I feel like 4 months is not long enough into the relationship to tell her to delete the photos, and I would only  ask her to delete the group ones.", "LMAO as soon as I read that I was damn...she is SMART!!", "I aspire to be this girl at 21 for the rest of my life."]}
