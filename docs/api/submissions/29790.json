I'm not on the meds anymore, but the side effects are pretty terrible. The side effects and healing process from the procedure are at their worst yesterday and today. I'm not supposed to do anything strenuous including hiking, kicking, jumping, or running for two weeks. \n\nMy in-laws came into town for a week and we haven't seen them in 9 months. My spouse booked a reservation for a tour at a national park a few months ago, not knowing I would be undergoing this medical treatment.\n\nI didn't really want to go but my spouse insisted I should come along and that all the activities would be something I could do. The activities discussed were a \"quick stop for pictures at National Park A, sightsee around town, go to hotel and spend the night, check out of hotel, tour at National Park B, go home.\n\nOn the 3 hour car ride to the town with the national park, my spouse suddenly decided to stop by an additional national park to hike. This is a national park we hiked at previously last year. I was not feeling well. They went to hike while I waited in the car. I was annoyed but it wasn't a big deal. After we got to the hotel, we didn't end up sightseeing in the town. \n\nToday, after checking out of the hotel, we went on the tour. It involved hiking 3 miles downhill mostly. I wasn't aware that the tour would be this strenuous. I tried to insist we do the easier tour which was half as long and mostly flat, but my spouse wasn't having it. I was mostly fine but in pain towards the end. To my surprise, my spouse suddenly decides to go on another hike at the national park from yesterday. It's a 4 mile hike. I'm in too much pain from the 3 mile hike I wasn't supposed to do in the first place today. I say I don't think it's fair to ditch me in the car alone like this. They all leave anyway.\n\nI'm currently alone in the car by myself and shocked I have signal. I'm pissed and I don't think I plan on talking to them the rest of the day. I'm tempted to just take the car and drive off.. I feel like it's extremely selfish to ditch me here at a park only a couple hours away from home which we've all been to before, not just yesterday, but previously when I was able to hike.\n\nWIBTA for starting an argument when they get back?\n\nEdited for clarification.\n\n\nUpdate: I didn't yell, but I did send a terse text message. I'm definitely upset. I was under the impression this trip would be something I could physically handle. Had I known all everyone wanted to do is hike, I would have stayed home like I wanted to in the first place. I plan on having words with my spouse in private later.

If going to the national parks was so important to him, the sensible thing would have been to leave you home. If spending time with both you and his parents was important to him, he could have made other plans.
