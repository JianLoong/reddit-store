My father was in Air force at that time. He married again 2 years after her death to a gem of a woman (mum). I did not know she was not my birth mom; the reason is that she treats me as her own son, I always felt the love and affection my real mother could have given me, my father was posted at a variety of place hence I became a military BRAT (BORN RAISED AND TRANSFERRED). She loves me more than anything. I soon became brother to my sister who is 6 years younger than me. Due to my affection for my mum my paternal family felt jealous and one time during a vacation when i was with my paternal family, they told me everything about my mother's death and my father remarrying (for purpose of causing a rift).\n\nI cried for hours that day, but it only raised the respect i had for my mum because how well she raised me and never let me feel that i am not her son. I told all this to my mother who went LC with her in-laws because they tried to break a mother-son bond. My father also resented and rebuked them for this but kept in touch.\n\nThe said incident is a year back when i was (16 years) old. My birth mother left some property for me before she passed (she was the second child of her parents) which i would inherit when i am 21. I came to know about this as my birth mothers' brother (my uncle) kept in touch with us (my father and mum were always nice to him, and my uncle and mum are sworn brother and sister). The said property is worth a lot, as my birth mother parents were rich and sort of politically involved.\n\nMy paternal family came to know about this and my father's brother (Bad Uncle -BG) showed at our doorstep demanding half of it. His reasoning is that my paternal grandparent property would be equally dived between the two so why should I get more money while my cousin (his son) won't get anything.\n\nThis soon caused a huge argument as my father wanted me to have a good future and not wanted me to worry about college and buying a home in future. This inheritance would let me do that. My mum told my BG and others that \"in no uncertain terms they would tolerate his shit. BG thought mum convinced me and my dad to refuse and he exploded.\n\nMy grandparents and other relatives took BG's side, as they all hated my birthmother and mum, in argument they called my mother a c\\*\\*t and a Gold-digger. This is where i think i was a asshole , I could not take it and said all nasty abuses a teenager could say and told him he is a greedy son of b\\*\\*\\*h.\n\nHe left stunned and later all of them called and texted to tell me i was a blood traitor and the A-hole for standing up for my mum who is not even related by blood. My only reply was relation is not by blood but by care and affection.\n\nAm i the A-hole reddit.", "created_utc": 1698414584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hnzok/aita_by_standing_up_for_the_women_who_raised_me/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the greedy family members are from your dad\u2019s side. Meaning they have no legal standing to claim any of it. They never had a right to it.
