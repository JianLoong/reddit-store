Jeremy and Violet would praise William\u2019s accomplishments while ignoring or undermining Juliana\u2019s. Juliana was frequently blamed and punished over William\u2019s poor behavior. Jeremy and Violet told Juliana that she would be out and on her own at 18 while William was always welcome and supported in their home. Juliana was able to live with me and my husband Louis, Juliana basically lived at our house since she was a teenager anyway.\n\nJuliana and William are both 28 now. My nephew has been in and out of jail since he was 19 because he cannot handle being told no or being denied what he wants. William\u2019s been kicked out by every family member who was willing to take him in, so now his go-to home is with his parents. Jeremy and Violet are dead broke. They planned to retire years ago, yet are still working and struggling with payments because of how much money they\u2019ve spent trying to bail William out and buy him what he wants. Juliana is by no means rich, but she is living comfortably and independently. \n\nJeremy and Violet are now reaching out to Juliana through other family members. They claim they want to talk with Juliana because \u201cwe miss her\u201d and \u201cbarely get to see her.\u201d But it\u2019s blatantly obvious that they\u2019re looking for financial help because at the rate Jeremy and Violet are going, they\u2019re going to be forced to downgrade their housing. Louis and Violet\u2019s great-grandparents built that house. It has a lot of sentimental value in their family and most of their other family members have said they would never forgive Jeremy and Violet if they lost the house.\n\nJuliana came to me and Louis because she felt like a selfish person for not wanting to take from her own savings to help her parents. And that several of the people have tried to guilt-trip her because her parents could have just given her up for adoption but instead provided for her for 18 years. We told Juliana that she doesn\u2019t owe Jeremy and Violet for providing for her because it was their choice to become parents and providing for her was their own responsibility. Juliana\u2019s hard-earned money is her own and she doesn\u2019t owe it to anyone else.\n\nNow Jeremy, Violet, and several of the people they used to contact Juliana have reached out to me and Louis and called us assholes. They said we have encouraged our niece to be unsympathetic to others and not help family in need. And that Jeremy and Violet are already suffering enough consequences because of William and losing the house on top of it would be a punishment for the entire family. Me and Louis feel what we said was true, because family is a two-way street and both sides need to be supported by one another. Even if Jeremy and Violet went above and beyond for Juliana the way they did with William, that would still be their choice and responsibility as parents and they aren\u2019t owed by their children.

She of course doesn't have to do this, but it would be nice to see how many of them pony up.", "NTA. If your family built the house, I'm assuming the only reason it has a mortgage is because Jeremy and Violet had to take on debt for William.

The race is run, it's far too late to switch loyalties to the one they abused then neglected.\n\nIf their home is such a big deal to the family as a whole, then the family as a whole can pitch in to keep it in the family.

We let her move in with us because we just moved and we had the extra space for her. \n\nA few months after she was living with us her dad had a stroke and couldn't work. She selflessly gave him $500 because she's just like that and she never expected It back. He gave her about $100 back anyway. \n\nShe recently had a bad break up with my brother so she was moving out (we weren't making her, she was just uncomfortable around him) and since she didn't have anywhere to stay she asked her dad if she could stay at his house for a few days. He declined but she still needed some money for tampons bc her job messed up her first paycheck and she's been broke. He gave her $20 and proceeded to tell her that she now owes him $40 (apparently he gave her $20)  like last month. She stayed with a friend last night and we've been calling every night.

I suppose if they set up a contract with a lawyer over the ownership of the house which would partly be given to her over the course of payments (make sure to keep proof of payment) it could be discussed.\n\nOtherwise, going to a super market and buying some smaller things may be fine so as long as they are grateful as they demand the same, but there is a limit to this and they would have to stop beeing so garessive in there approach to get her to caugh up money... which would be a hell of a nice action in my opinion.\n\nOtherwise those who want her to pay can do so themselves.\n\nOP i would not call you out for this but i am not on the same page either.", "A disgusting thing for them to say and even to think about.
