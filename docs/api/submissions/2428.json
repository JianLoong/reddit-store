Jeremy and Violet would praise William\u2019s accomplishments while ignoring or undermining Juliana\u2019s. Juliana was frequently blamed and punished over William\u2019s poor behavior. Jeremy and Violet told Juliana that she would be out and on her own at 18 while William was always welcome and supported in their home. Juliana was able to live with me and my husband Louis, Juliana basically lived at our house since she was a teenager anyway.\n\nJuliana and William are both 28 now. My nephew has been in and out of jail since he was 19 because he cannot handle being told no or being denied what he wants. William\u2019s been kicked out by every family member who was willing to take him in, so now his go-to home is with his parents. Jeremy and Violet are dead broke. They planned to retire years ago, yet are still working and struggling with payments because of how much money they\u2019ve spent trying to bail William out and buy him what he wants. Juliana is by no means rich, but she is living comfortably and independently. \n\nJeremy and Violet are now reaching out to Juliana through other family members. They claim they want to talk with Juliana because \u201cwe miss her\u201d and \u201cbarely get to see her.\u201d But it\u2019s blatantly obvious that they\u2019re looking for financial help because at the rate Jeremy and Violet are going, they\u2019re going to be forced to downgrade their housing. Louis and Violet\u2019s great-grandparents built that house. It has a lot of sentimental value in their family and most of their other family members have said they would never forgive Jeremy and Violet if they lost the house.\n\nJuliana came to me and Louis because she felt like a selfish person for not wanting to take from her own savings to help her parents. And that several of the people have tried to guilt-trip her because her parents could have just given her up for adoption but instead provided for her for 18 years. We told Juliana that she doesn\u2019t owe Jeremy and Violet for providing for her because it was their choice to become parents and providing for her was their own responsibility. Juliana\u2019s hard-earned money is her own and she doesn\u2019t owe it to anyone else.\n\nNow Jeremy, Violet, and several of the people they used to contact Juliana have reached out to me and Louis and called us assholes. They said we have encouraged our niece to be unsympathetic to others and not help family in need. And that Jeremy and Violet are already suffering enough consequences because of William and losing the house on top of it would be a punishment for the entire family. Me and Louis feel what we said was true, because family is a two-way street and both sides need to be supported by one another. Even if Jeremy and Violet went above and beyond for Juliana the way they did with William, that would still be their choice and responsibility as parents and they aren\u2019t owed by their children.
