{"id": 2428, "submission_id": "ywhct5", "title": "AITA For encouraging my niece to not help her struggling parents and let them lose their house?", "selftext": "My brother-in-law Jeremy and sister-in-law Violet did only the bare, law-required minimum in raising my niece Juliana yet spoiled my nephew William. Jeremy and Violet would praise William\u2019s accomplishments while ignoring or undermining Juliana\u2019s. Juliana was frequently blamed and punished over William\u2019s poor behavior. Jeremy and Violet told Juliana that she would be out and on her own at 18 while William was always welcome and supported in their home. Juliana was able to live with me and my husband Louis, Juliana basically lived at our house since she was a teenager anyway.\n\nJuliana and William are both 28 now. My nephew has been in and out of jail since he was 19 because he cannot handle being told no or being denied what he wants. William\u2019s been kicked out by every family member who was willing to take him in, so now his go-to home is with his parents. Jeremy and Violet are dead broke. They planned to retire years ago, yet are still working and struggling with payments because of how much money they\u2019ve spent trying to bail William out and buy him what he wants. Juliana is by no means rich, but she is living comfortably and independently. \n\nJeremy and Violet are now reaching out to Juliana through other family members. They claim they want to talk with Juliana because \u201cwe miss her\u201d and \u201cbarely get to see her.\u201d But it\u2019s blatantly obvious that they\u2019re looking for financial help because at the rate Jeremy and Violet are going, they\u2019re going to be forced to downgrade their housing. Louis and Violet\u2019s great-grandparents built that house. It has a lot of sentimental value in their family and most of their other family members have said they would never forgive Jeremy and Violet if they lost the house.\n\nJuliana came to me and Louis because she felt like a selfish person for not wanting to take from her own savings to help her parents. And that several of the people have tried to guilt-trip her because her parents could have just given her up for adoption but instead provided for her for 18 years. We told Juliana that she doesn\u2019t owe Jeremy and Violet for providing for her because it was their choice to become parents and providing for her was their own responsibility. Juliana\u2019s hard-earned money is her own and she doesn\u2019t owe it to anyone else.\n\nNow Jeremy, Violet, and several of the people they used to contact Juliana have reached out to me and Louis and called us assholes. They said we have encouraged our niece to be unsympathetic to others and not help family in need. And that Jeremy and Violet are already suffering enough consequences because of William and losing the house on top of it would be a punishment for the entire family. Me and Louis feel what we said was true, because family is a two-way street and both sides need to be supported by one another. Even if Jeremy and Violet went above and beyond for Juliana the way they did with William, that would still be their choice and responsibility as parents and they aren\u2019t owed by their children.

Perhaps all of the people reaching out to tell you that it was wrong to support your niece should open up their own wallets to give these people the money to save their home.", "NTA! Nothing you\u2019ve said is incorrect family is a 2 way street. \n\nTell the people harassing you and Juliana to support her parents then. They\u2019re family too so they can reach into their entitled pockets and fork over some money.", "*\"several of the people have tried to guilt-trip her because her parents could have just given her up for adoption but instead provided for her for 18 years.\"*\n\nWait, what?  That's fucked up, why would someone say that to her? I hope that poor girl has some healthy emotional support. \n\nEveryone sounds awful, NTA", "NTA, you guys did the right thing and hopefully Juliana listens to you.  Tough love sometimes is the right call when dealing with hard situations for people to learn and grow.  It\u2019s time for Jeremy and Violet to face the consequences of their actions for how they treated their kids.", "NTA - If they wanted financial help from their kid they shouldn't have burned the bridge with her. If those family members think she is soOoO selfish for not sending money they should put their money where their selfish mouths are. In fact, you should do a pretend fundraiser \"Julianna will match every dollar the rest of the family donates\". She of course doesn't have to do this, but it would be nice to see how many of them pony up.", "NTA. If your family built the house, I'm assuming the only reason it has a mortgage is because Jeremy and Violet had to take on debt for William. Tell them to transfer the title of the house to Juliana and/or you, and Juliana and/or you will take over the mortgage (this way, the house stays in the family). Seems like a fair trade for a bunch of jackasses.", "NTA. Thank you for telling Juliana exactly what she needed to hear. Maybe tell her that she should ask the people bothering her what they've done to help her parents, since her parents have never done anything to help her and they're the ones *soooo* worried about them.", "NTA. They backed the wrong horse and it drained them dry. The race is run, it's far too late to switch loyalties to the one they abused then neglected.\n\nIf their home is such a big deal to the family as a whole, then the family as a whole can pitch in to keep it in the family. Jeremy and Violet made their choices, the consequences followed.", "NTA who are doing this poor girl a FAVOR. If she helps now she will be constantly contacted first for help in the future. You are giving her an outside opinion and she\u2019s almost 30 so you definitely aren\u2019t teaching her to be unsympathetic, your helping her understand what she already knows", "NTA, the parents treated her badly, so karma ig", "NTA - wow... This poor girl! Thank goodness she had you guys. And no, she owes them nothing.", "NTA, but Juliana may need to feel like the hero in a desperate attempt to have some acknowledgement from these awful people. Sadly, it'll just open the door for more mistreatment. She'll have to live with her decision, though, so I hope you've let her know you'll love her no matter what she chooses.", "NTA. Seems like everyone else should close their mouths and open their wallets.", "NTA \n\nIf Juliana were to help out J & V there would be no end to their begging and they, in the end, would still criticize her for abandoning them when she finally stops subsidizing them.  \n\nYou gave J good advice and did a good thing, not an asshole thing.\n\nThey made their bed and now it's nighty night.", "NTA\n\nJeremy and Violet made their choices and are now dealing with the consequences. A deadbeat son has drained their savings, and they ruined their relationship with their daughter. \n\nIf I were Juliana, I'd tell them all to go to hell.", "NTA. These people seem to care a hell of a lot more about a house than Juliana. They don\u2019t want a house neglected\u2026where was their sympathy and concern when a child was being neglected? \n\nJuliana should protect herself from these so-called \u201csupportive\u201d family members.
