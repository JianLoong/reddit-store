This Christmas, his family (Mom, dad, sister and nephew) came to visit him from his birth country (Spain) for the first time in years. I was excited because I never had a chance to meet them in person.\n\nThey arrived a few days before Christmas, he went to pick them up at the airport while I was working, so when I came home they were already there. The meeting didn't go as well as I would wish, because the little nephew as soon as he saw me started doing the eye stretching thing. He was immediately reprimanded by his mom and grandparents, but the following days he made a lot of racist jokes in Spanish like \"What do you call someone who doesn't take a shower, in Chinese? Shin-Shan-PU (without shampoo)\" and he was barely reprimanded for that.\n\nBesides that, Christmas went great, and the next day we woke up very late. The nephew started saying that he wanted Chinese Food for lunch, so my BF's parents asked me if I could make it, I said sure, I was glad to do it. I cooked something my parents would do in a special occasion like these, and served the table in a very traditional way, with chopsticks and everything. Then I called everybody to the table, and instantly saw their disappointed faces.\n\nThe nephew said \"What's this?\" to which I said \"Chinese food\" he grunted and said \"No is not\" and started to throw a fit. His mom calmed him down, then BF's parents told me \"This isn't what we were expecting\" I asked \"What did you expect?\" and they replied \"You know, something like what they serve at restaurants\". I tried to explain to them that this is something actual Chinese people eat, but wouldn't listen. They dressed up and went outside to eat at a restaurant.\n\nMy BF stayed at home, but then called me stupid, he said \"You knew exactly what they meant by Chinese food, I'm trying to make YOU look good in front of them, but you're not helping me by playing dumb\". I asked him to explain himself better but just shouted \"When people say Chinese food the last thing they expect is white rice, get a f\\*ing clue\" and locked himself in our bedroom.\n\nSince that incident, they started to speak to me as a toddler, over explaining everything they asked me to do, and stopped correcting the nephew's racist behavior. I tried to tell my BF to tell them to stop, but he said \"This is you're making, now they think you're brainless\" This continued till they left yesterday.\n\nMy BF and I now barely talk, and I wonder if it's really my fault and I should have known better.\n\nEdit: Lots of you are calling my BF racist, but before this he didn't show any racism towards me, I know sometimes he is rude to some people, but he never before was this rude to me, the only thing I might think of is he motivating me to improve my Spanish while he never did an effort to learn Chinese for me, but I understand that Chinese is hard. Just want to make it clear that he is not a cartoon racist villain.\n\nEdit 2: For those asking what the food was, it was some combination of Dim Sum and hu\u01d2gu\u014d that my dad likes to make. My dad likes to cook, but he is no good following recipes, so he does it in his particular style, and of course I was limited by the ingredients I had in that exact moment, but I did my best. Oh and for the \\*White\\* rice thing, yeah, I included white rice, I know many Americanized or Westernized Chinese restaurants doesn't serve white rice.", "created_utc": 1672269941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxolf2/aita_for_cooking_my_bfs_family_chinese_food/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck OP. \n\n\nThey\u2019re the assholes for expecting you to make an americanized version of your native cuisine when they simply asked for Chinese food.

Every family has a few assholes but if you\u2019re dating one of them (evidenced by his inability to stand up for you or side w you) you need to get out for your own good.

Because it's not going to get better. \nAnd I get steamed rice whenever I go to a Chinese restaurant, I've never been a fan of fried rice. Reminds me too much of pegao.", "if anyone is dumb here, it\u2019s certainly not you. the white rice comment alone\u2026 every american chinese restaurant serves white rice. like, what?\n\nNTA and DTMFA", "NTA. Don\u2019t let him or his racist family treat you like that. He is showing his true self. Believe it. \n\nBesides, how someone treats others is a good indicator of what kind of person they are. I once turned a blind eye to that kind of behavior, bad move.", "NTA. Your boyfriend and his family are. Please break up with him.", "Woah wtf. His family is super rude and racist and your boyfriend acts like a child. NTA", "NTA  - what planet is your bf from where white rice isn't one of the FIRST things that comes to mind as Chinese food?", "NTA", "OP, your boyfriend is definitely racist. He just hides it in front of you. The person he is showing you now is who he really is. \n\nWhen discussing more recent world events with a friend I said something along the lines of \"I can't believe how many people are making racist and homophobic remarks in public lately. People I've known my whole life are changing\" and she responded \"no, they've always said those things. Just not in front you because you'd call them out.\" They'd even make jokes like \"okay, *my name* is gone, we don't have to be so PC anymore\". It's disappointing to find out that people you care about suck. \n\nCall his shit out, OP. Call out his family's shit. Racism thrives when left unchecked. NTA", "NTA. Honey, you\u2019ve likely dealt with racism throughout your life and so it is slightly normalised. But it is not, ever, to be accepted from someone who claims to love you. \n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet he\u2019s been dreading this meeting because he knows they are not accepting of other cultures and is blaming you, not them, for it not going well. But it is NOT your fault. You were welcoming and accepting and cooked them a meal that was special to you. \n\nHe needs an ultimatum to either support you fully or leave. You deserve better than that treatment.", "NTA.  Your bf and his family treated you horribly. You deserve so much better.", "YEOOOOOOOOO DON'T PISS ME OFFF. NTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DTMFA!!!!", "NTA -- he is racist though. Just because he wasn't racist to your face at the start doesn't mean he isn't racist. He is enabling his family's racism and treating you very poorly. He doesn't have to be cartoon racist to be toxic.  \n\n\nRemember assholes aren't assholes to everyone, otherwise they wouldn't get anywhere in life. They pick and choose their victims. Looks like he is comfortable enough to drop the mask. This is just a peek. Stick around and it will get MUCH worse.", "NTA. Their behaviour is outrageous, and honestly, you should just dump the BF now because he will never respect you or be on your side. And his family are beyond rude.", "NTA.  I do want to point out something though.  You are saying he isn't racist, but from what you've written, he did not step in once to tell his nephew to knock it off.  He /allowed/ it.  That may not be 'in your face' racism, but it is /definitely/ racism.", "NTA. He\u2019s merely a long term bf now. You can part ways with ease. Do NOT marry this man! His family are part of that package, and you do not need that. He let them treat you like a maid and like trash, and he blamed their snotty behaviour on YOU. They\u2019re just rude and racist. That was entirely their own doing, not to mention wrong.", "NTA I would recommend you look seriously at your boyfriend's behavior and decide if this low behavior is really what you want to settle for.", "nta. kick his ass out!! what a rude loser.", "NTA this family is racist and he did nothing to stand up for you. He\u2019s blaming you because he agrees with their racism. He wanted to prove you were \u201cone of the good ones\u201d. He wanted a nice token Chinese girl to wait on his family and make them look good. The idea that they would turn around and ask you to cook for them on the drop of a dime with no preparation and then immediately dismiss you and your work because it wasn\u2019t faux Chinese food - this is rage inducing.", "OP. \n\nHe allowed his family to use racial slurs and insults against you. Multiple times. For how many days???\n\nHe\u2019s not the one. Really. This is horrific. \n\nNTA", "NTA - your bf has shown you who he truly is. (Hint: he\u2019s racist)", "NTA but do yourself a favor and remove this jerk and his racist family from your life. Seriously. You deserve better, especially after making what is surely a delicious meal.", "NTA. You are not in any way at fault. Your BF called you stupid amongst a whole lot of other vile things? And his entire family are openly racist to you and he has done nothing to stop it? You absolutely need to get rid of his ass. Like, yesterday. He and his family are awful human beings. This makes me so mad, especially because he's twisted things so you think you are at fault.", "He is not a cartoon villain, but sometimes the most hurtful racism can be letting micro-aggressions slide, not defending you. He has the opportunity to show his family what Chinese food from China is, be proud of you, and tell his nephew they could go out later and look at the differences and tell the story for Chinese coming to America. But I'm willing to bet, despite wanting you to learn Spanish, he might not know much of this Chinese history. \nI'm sorry, but he is exhibiting racist behavior- we all have assumptions we need corrected and the sign of  a good person is whether he is willing to correct a hurtful behavior towards you. And he is not demonstrating that, and even doubling down, and I would take that very seriously.", "NTA\n\nI would have been tempted to talk to them like toddlers for being surprised that they were served authentic Chinese food when they ask a Chinese person to make it. You COULD have asked what they meant, but shouldn\u2019t have to. They should have clarified. Sounds like the type of folks that are upset when authentic Mexican restaurants do not serve Tex-Mex. \n\nI am in the US. It is not exactly a secret that most ethic food in the US is bastardized versions of the real thing. Every single \u201cChinese\u201d restaurant I have ever been in served white rice. You could upgrade it to fried rice if you wanted. \n\nI would have kicked his family for being so disrespectful in your house. Might want to kick out your BF too. That is not even remotely okay. \n\nI am sorry you had that experience.", "When I get Chinese food, I get white rice with whatever I get. All of the Chinese restaurants near me serve entrees with a choice of fried rice or white rice. \n\nNTA your boyfriend is racist. Even a little racist is still racist. His family is racist, although some of them might just be ignorant that westernized Chinese restaurants aren\u2019t always authentic Chinese cuisine, it\u2019s westernized to fit the people they serve. It\u2019s like asking for Mexican food and expecting tacos. Some people genuinely don\u2019t know that\u2019s not what people eat regularly. \n\nWhen offered traditional food from another culture that I haven\u2019t tried, I at least try it. I at least try food any host offers me, unless it\u2019s something I know for a fact I won\u2019t like. (Basically ketchup and Brussel sprouts.) They didn\u2019t even try it, and that is rude even if you were the same race.", "Ok. Your boyfriend expected a Chinese person to make bastardized Chinese food. He allowed his family to make racist comments, and he called you dumb and said this was your fault? \n\nI have always had white rice with Chinese food. But I go to higher end more traditional Chinese places. \n\nYou need a new bf. He is T A. You are NTA.", "I would serve bf an eviction notice via text, SM, email and verbally. Then I'd give his family 30 min to pack up their shit and leave before calling the cops on them for trespassing.", "I know my kids eat the f out of the white rice when we order Chinese. My husband also follows a large number of Asian YouTube cooking videos...so we make it at home also.", "People who only go to Panda Express and therefore choose fried rice and noodles.\n\nI mean, it's not even a side dish. Rice may as well be a plate, that's how essential it is to Chinese food.", "I think most people swap the white rice out for noodles or fried rice when they\u2019re ordering takeout. You have to ask specifically for it at our local place because so few people want white rice with their meals.", "Yeah, the rest was super racist and awful. This part was just stupid though. \n\nI live in the US. In the Midwest. In Indiana. In a rural suburb. Cornfields and rednecks and people who legitimately say things like \"don't be thinkin just cause you be gettin up good you gotta go to the high falutten places like Applebee's all the time now, ya hear\". *\n\nI can't get Chinese delivered to my house, but my take out sure as hell always has white rice. In Podunk.\n\n(Actual statement from an uncle two years ago)", "Wait till they learn that's Japanese lol", "Seriously??!!! Good to know I'm not the only one.", "Well being Spain isn't considered Latino at all...like calling British American or Australian. Just cuz they speak the same root language doesn't make them the same.", "\u2620\ufe0f", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Restaurant food isn\u2019t real (insert country here) food. They asked a Chinese woman to make Chinese food. She made Chinese food they got mad bc it wasn\u2019t the over salted crap they serve in restaurants.\n\nEdit to say: OP I\u2019d eat your food in a heartbeat. I\u2019ve had the real thing.

Please don't get sucked into that \"redeemable jerk\" trope where the girl stays with a dude who is a complete rude asshole to everyone because \"but he's always nice to me!\" That's always bad news, trust me. \n\nNTA but you deserve better than this.

From the SUPER Americanized to the \"if nobody at the table speaks Cantonese or Mandarin, you're not getting food\"... All automatically came with white rice.", "It\u2019s my preference as well but it took a few tries before someone told me to request it.", "We have this local place called Chino Bandido and it's Mexican/Asian fusion food and my god it is so good.", "Similarly westernized as US \"chinese\" food.
