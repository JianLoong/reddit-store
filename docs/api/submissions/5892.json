This Christmas, his family (Mom, dad, sister and nephew) came to visit him from his birth country (Spain) for the first time in years. I was excited because I never had a chance to meet them in person.\n\nThey arrived a few days before Christmas, he went to pick them up at the airport while I was working, so when I came home they were already there. The meeting didn't go as well as I would wish, because the little nephew as soon as he saw me started doing the eye stretching thing. He was immediately reprimanded by his mom and grandparents, but the following days he made a lot of racist jokes in Spanish like \"What do you call someone who doesn't take a shower, in Chinese? Shin-Shan-PU (without shampoo)\" and he was barely reprimanded for that.\n\nBesides that, Christmas went great, and the next day we woke up very late. The nephew started saying that he wanted Chinese Food for lunch, so my BF's parents asked me if I could make it, I said sure, I was glad to do it. I cooked something my parents would do in a special occasion like these, and served the table in a very traditional way, with chopsticks and everything. Then I called everybody to the table, and instantly saw their disappointed faces.\n\nThe nephew said \"What's this?\" to which I said \"Chinese food\" he grunted and said \"No is not\" and started to throw a fit. His mom calmed him down, then BF's parents told me \"This isn't what we were expecting\" I asked \"What did you expect?\" and they replied \"You know, something like what they serve at restaurants\". I tried to explain to them that this is something actual Chinese people eat, but wouldn't listen. They dressed up and went outside to eat at a restaurant.\n\nMy BF stayed at home, but then called me stupid, he said \"You knew exactly what they meant by Chinese food, I'm trying to make YOU look good in front of them, but you're not helping me by playing dumb\". I asked him to explain himself better but just shouted \"When people say Chinese food the last thing they expect is white rice, get a f\\*ing clue\" and locked himself in our bedroom.\n\nSince that incident, they started to speak to me as a toddler, over explaining everything they asked me to do, and stopped correcting the nephew's racist behavior. I tried to tell my BF to tell them to stop, but he said \"This is you're making, now they think you're brainless\" This continued till they left yesterday.\n\nMy BF and I now barely talk, and I wonder if it's really my fault and I should have known better.\n\nEdit: Lots of you are calling my BF racist, but before this he didn't show any racism towards me, I know sometimes he is rude to some people, but he never before was this rude to me, the only thing I might think of is he motivating me to improve my Spanish while he never did an effort to learn Chinese for me, but I understand that Chinese is hard. Just want to make it clear that he is not a cartoon racist villain.\n\nEdit 2: For those asking what the food was, it was some combination of Dim Sum and hu\u01d2gu\u014d that my dad likes to make. My dad likes to cook, but he is no good following recipes, so he does it in his particular style, and of course I was limited by the ingredients I had in that exact moment, but I did my best. Oh and for the \\*White\\* rice thing, yeah, I included white rice, I know many Americanized or Westernized Chinese restaurants doesn't serve white rice.", "created_utc": 1672269941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxolf2/aita_for_cooking_my_bfs_family_chinese_food/", "score": 817, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even Chinese takeaways in the UK serve white rice, and they obviously aren't authentic, so what the hell were they expecting instead of rice??", "NTA.   Please dump this guy. Why didn't he defend you when the family is racist?  It is because he is used to it.  It is the norm to him.  Kick him out of your place and find someone better.  Why are you not angry?  He is disrespectful and his family sounds terrible.   As an Asian woman,  you know who he is by his family.   Why waste time with this dude?", "I don\u2019t understand their why white rice comment.

It\u2019s not innate! \n\nHaving lived with your boyfriend he should understand that when you cook Chinese food you cook REAL Chinese food. Surely his family would also expect this.

Honey, dump this dude.", "Dump your boyfriend immediately.

There is a guy out there who want gaslight you and treat YOU like you\u2019re dumb just because his family is too stupid to know what Chinese food is. Do not subject yourself to this level of racism your whole life. Do you really want to expose your family to this level of racism?? Would you want these people to be present for every milestone for the rest of your life? Would you want your future kids to be exposed to people this disgustingly racist? You deserve better than this.", "NTA but girl. As a fellow POC please tell your boyfriend to fuck off. You\u2019ve been with your partner for three years. Surely you have cooked Chinese food in that time? How could he have expected anything different than what you made? And beyond that, him allowing his family to be racist towards you means that he either doesn\u2019t care or he secretly agrees. Neither is okay. \n\nPlease put yourself first and leave him. If you want kids his family is going to say the same nasty shit to them that they say to you.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is racist. Don\u2019t let this become your life.

There are better men out there.", "So NTA. You\u2019re Chinese, you made food. If they wanted restaurant style food, they should go to a restaurant. Just get out. The whole family is racist including your bf. He might be nice and his behavior might not be obviously racist, the fact that he didn\u2019t stop his family from being bullies means he agrees with them subconsciously.

This was shocking to me........ Thats like saying I want proper Italian food and not expecting pasta?\n\nEVERY single Chinese restaurant that I have eaten at serves white rice, this is UK, USA, Jamaica, Germany and in fact when you order meat dishes they usually AUTOMATICALLY bring white rice.\n\nYou need to rethink this relationship it is grotesque how his family treated you.\n\nNTA", "Just dump him already.

Every American-style Chinese restaurant I've been to *did* have white rice.", "Seeing lots of red flags here. NTA. Your boyfriend clearly does not advocate for you. If he really cared, he could have talked to his family instead about how diverse chinese food is. Instead, he berated you. Doesn\u2019t matter whether or not he\u2019s been racist to you before. He\u2019s rude and this will not be the last time he\u2019ll verbally attack you.\n\nAnd the fact that his nephew acts like a spoiled little racist without being reprimanded hard enough?

It just shows how little your boyfriend and his family respects you.\n\nA respectful response would have been to stay and eat what you\u2019ve been served. You were the host!
