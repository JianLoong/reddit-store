Her father & I recently agreed to let her go to a friend 'Haleys' (also 13) birthday party & sleepover. It was to be 8 girls supervised by Haley's dad 'Ken', his 20y/o daughter 'Lise' and Ken's girlfriend 'Moira'. I know and trust Ken, and his daughter Lise. Lise and Haley are good girls. He has mostly raised them alone but he's a good and responsible man, so I agreed. Moira I don't know AS well. I've met her about 10 times, and she's only been Ken's partner about a year. But Haley is a dear friend to Ana and the core friend group was going, so I said yes.\n\nIt was an all day affair, with the girls being dropped off Saturday morning, spending the day together, then sleeping over and coming home on Sunday. That was the plan. Except at about 7:00 PM Saturday, I got a frantic call from Haley asking me to come get her. While I was still on the phone with her, my husband got a call from Ken saying we needed to come get her and the party was cancelled.\n\nIt was very confusing, but we jumped in the car and drove quick to Ken's house (same town). Some of the girls were out on the lawn, and all looked upset. Ken was out there with them, and another set of parents had already arrived. Ana ran up to us looking like she'd been crying, and Ken came up to us to explain. \n\nTurns out, Moira had accidentally taken Haley's medication before supper instead of her own, and started acting off. It culminated in her snapping at some of the girls, starting to shout and swear, and then she started babbling, screaming, running around before accusing them of being out to hurt her and locked herself in the bathroom. She had apparently called some of the girls including Ana 'little bitches who'd get what was coming to them'. Someone called the cops (I'm not sure who) and they were apparently en route. \n\nI like Ken, and I really like Haley. But when I heard the story, I saw red. I had husband put Ana in the car & told Ken (not very kindly) that he shouldn't have someone acting like this around his children & told him that if Ana was too badly affected I'd likely press charges. He seemed very embarrassed and sorry, and we left in a hurry. We passed the cops on our way home.\n\nWas I too hard on Ken? And WIBTA if I pressed charges against Moira for endangering the kids? I understand it was an accident and that illness is difficult, I have a condition I medicate as well. But this wasn't safe and could've gone terribly. I do not know what Haley's or Moira's conditions are. Thanks for any input\n\nEDIT!!: You've made good points and since it happened on the weekend I've had time to calm down. I definitely won't be pressing any charges, and will likely approach Ken to apologize for snapping. Please disregard my WIBTA question, I am no longer considering contacting police\n\nEdit 2: someone suggested I share this thread with the other parents who were considering involving police. We have a group chat that we were using to discuss. I've just sent this thread into the group chat & encouraged all the parents to hear yous out.

She took the wrong pills. \n\nSaying Ken \"shouldn't\" have that behavior around the kids. It seems as if he knows that as shown by him cancelling the party and getting the girls outside away from the drama.\n\nSaying they endangered the kids is a stretch. Do you consider making smores over a fire pit endangering? That could go terribly wrong too.\n\nIf you understand what illness is like and how hard it could be, why not give some grace and ask if there's anything you can do to help.", "YWBTA\n\nMoira didn't endanger children in the description you gave, and the police are already involved.\n\nKen did the right thing. It's now a family matter, and they don't need you exaggerating events or adding drama. Moira is the one that is sick, Haley had her birthday party ruined, and Ken is dealing with a shitshow. But you want to add to his nightmare with some trumped up charges.\n\nWow\n\nHow about being a supportive friend and offering to take Ana and Haley to do something fun. Or drop off a casserole. Be part of the solution.", "Info: press charges against WHAT? What is the crime here?", "YTA.  Press charges for what?  You don\u2019t seem to be disputing that Moira took the medication by accident, and frankly, it sounds like *she* felt more threatened by the girls in her altered state than the reverse.", "YWBTA  No crime was committed. There's nothing to press charges for. It sounds like a weird situation, but Ken called and said the party was cancelled and asked you to come get her right away, so he did the right thing under the circumstances and did not let things continue.", "While it was a terrible situation, I am leaning YTA if you press charges. Ultimately everything was okay, and Ken reacted quickly and seemed to work to get the girls to someplace safe (out of the home and away from Moira). He took the incident seriously by immediately calling parents. With the police en route, you\u2019d assume that appropriate action would be taken if needed legally. The only necessary step would be potentially requesting Moira support any cost associated with Ana talking with a therapist if this incident sticks with her.\n\nHopefully Moira gets the help she needs! And your daughter never has to see her again.", "YWBTA\n\nThere was no crime here. You're just upset.\n\n> Turns out, Moira had accidentally taken Haley's medication before supper instead of her own, and started acting off. It culminated in her snapping at some of the girls, starting to shout and swear, and then she started babbling, screaming, running around before accusing them of being out to hurt her and locked herself in the bathroom.\n\nWhat the hell medication **_was_** this??", "YTA if you were to push forward. \n\nFirst, I doubt there is anything to press charges on.\n\nSecond, you said you consider Ken to be responsible,  and he just showed you he is. He took care of the girls, defused the situation, informed the parents and ended the sleepover. There isn't much more he could do or could have done. \n\nThird, he was upfront about the situation, didn't try to minimise or brush it off. Explained context. The guy sounds solid. This adds more to point 2 in a way.", "YTA. It's hard to know whether this was really an accident or Moira has a problem, but Ken immediately cancelled the party, removed the girls from the home, and called their parents to pick them up.  I don't see how you have any charges to press against him?\n\nIn addition, consider Haley, whose party was ruined and who must be absolutely mortified by this whole thing.  For her sake, can you not escalate this?", "You know, I honestly *don't know* if YTA for being angry at Ken. If it's a genuine accident, then I feel bad for M H and K most of all. But I think you're probably overreacting. I'm sure this was a disturbing experience to your kid, but I think \"endangering\" is a stretch - if M was running around **with a knife** before accusing them - then yeah, no question, child endangerment. This just sounds like a woman got ill and yelled a lot before taking herself out of the kids environment, and at no point was Ken himself incapacitated. Ana is a kid, and you should be putting your effort into comforting and reassuring her, not venting to Ken or to Reddit.\n\nRight now, I would imagine Moira is mortified beyond belief. I don't see how pressing charges helps you, or them, or anyone. What is the benefit to *anyone*!? So YWBTA for that, and I'm tending towards YTA for focusing on your anger instead of your child. You've only given a single sentence about how she is and that's that \"she'd been crying before you picked her up\".\n\nSo YTA for misplaced priorities.", "Yeah - YWBTA.\n\nInstead, make lemonade.  Turn this into a learning opportunity for the girls about the dangers of taking other people\u2019s medicine.  They are getting to the age where kids will have illegal drugs at parties, or they may be offered things like ritalin to help them concentrate for a big test.  They need to understand the dangers of taking medicine that is not prescribed for them.", "YWBTA your making a mountain out of a molehill. Did your daughter get hurt? Did any of the kids get hurt or were they physically in danger? Because you said the lady locked herself in the bathroom so at most it's an eyesore of an event and you don't associate with then moving forward. If you were to press charges you would be laughed out of court and it would do nothing but waste money.", "YTA You went into a bad situation and decided to try and make it worse, for no good reason. \n\nHow is pressing charges, that likely won't go anywhere because nothing happened, going to resolve the lady who took the wrong medication?  I'm sure she's embarrassed enough as it is.", "YTA. Medication mix-ups can have serious side-effects, so it doesn't sound like Ken is making it up to protect Moira. He also did everything in his power to protect the kids. So what I'm hearing is you saying you want to press charges against someone for an accident that didn't really culminate in anything except a few unfortunate words and a cancelled party?", "Was it really an accident? Or, was the girlfriend using someone else\u2019s RX recreationally?\n\nAlso, pretty sure there is nothing for you to press charges on here. The cops were there. If they determined anything illegal was happening. They would have chosen to make an arrest, or not.", "That's a horrible situation.\n\nBut I'm not sure how pressing charges would help. As rough as that experience must have been, your child is going to be okay. Putting a mentally ill woman through our deeply flawed legal system probably wouldn't help rehabilitate her in any way, nor will it benefit your daughter at all. You would just be punishing Moira.\n\nI think you should just not allow your daughter to go to Haley's house anymore and call it a day. Getting the legal system involved seems vindictive and unhelpful.", "INFO:  what did the cops do after they left?  Did anyone get arrested?  If they didn't arrest her, then there are probably no charges to press.  Remember, it wasn't intentional.  It was a mistake.  Of course it wasn't safe but not 1 person could have known what the outcome would have been.   Also, medication bottles almost all look alike.  You know this.  It was a lapse in judgement.  Give them a break.  You yourself said they are good people.  You yourself said that Ken was very embarrassed and sorry.  What more do you want from them.  Offer support and check in with them to see if everything is alright because, and I quote, \"*I like Ken, and I really like Haley\".*  So be there for them.", "NTA for being upset. If the meds are capable of changing someone\u2019s state of mind or behavior, or if Moira has a condition that requires such meds, then YWBTA for trying to press charges. \n\nSounds like Moira is already having a tough time. I know you want to protect your kid, but this sounds like an embarrassing accident for Moira. Imagine being in her position.", "YTA- if anything, Ken is awesome for immediately removing the kids from the situation.", "nta because she could of really hurt someone. ywbta if you press charges. still kind of confused how the gf took the daughters meds", "Ywbta, Moira missed her meds and had an episode. Ken was responsible and decided the kids should leave. No issues here.", "You sound like you\u2019re reasonable at heart. I\u2019m here after your edit. I\u2019m glad things have calmed down. I agree YWBTA if you pressed charges. I\u2019d apologize. He was already trying to handle the situation the best he could. All 3 are probably extremely embarrassed.", "I really hate when parents excuse mean shitty behavior as being a mama bear. You acted like a jerk and should apologize, and don\u2019t use your kid as an excuse to treat people poorly. Your kid wasn\u2019t in any danger and should not be actually traumatized by this events, so the mana bear shit isn\u2019t justified. You\u2019re ignorant about mental illness and should educate yourself.", "YTA if you pressed charges. As scary as the situation sounds, it was an accident and your daughter is scared, but not harmed. Ken acted responsibly, calling parents to pick up their kids so he could handle the situation. In addition, overreacting and getting your daughter's best friend's dad in trouble might make your daughter less inclined to call you for help in the future. \n\nA reasonable response would be to say that you don't want your daughter to go to sleepovers at Haley's in the future as long as Moira is there. I think it's also be reasonable to be made at Moira and Ken! But being mad at someone, or disappointed by them, doesn't mean that it's a legal matter. \n\nIf you want to rebuild bridges while still making your boundaries clear, I'd offer to host Haley for a sleepover at your place. Give her and Ana some good memories and a bit of a do-over, just on a smaller, quieter scale.", "YWBTA for sure. Mistakes happen. If you take a medication that was prescribed for someone else, who knows what could happen.\n\nSo you'd sue them why? Money money money.\n\nEdit: Nobody got hurt, so no idea why you'd be chasing money here. Oh I know...so you could strike it rich with a payday.", "What was the medication? That seems like a serious side effect if the explanation is actually true. Maybe she has some honest mental health problems and snapped. I wouldn't press charges but maybe not offer for your child to stay at that house anymore.  \nIt'll become more obvious as time goes on", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t know all the facts and making assumptions is always dangerous\n\nKen acted responsibly by seeing that something was wrong and immediately trying to remove all the girls from the situation\n\nTherefore there is no crime and I think you\u2019d be wasting your time trying to get the police involved", "I want to say one thing but considering it was a mix up(should have been reading names on bottles but whatever)..if this is fhe 1st time its ever happened that you know of altogether YTA for pressing charges considering if the medication caused her to do that especially if she's never acted out like that before.", "YTA if you press charges, not that you would likely be able to anyway. It\u2019s a parent you know well and call a good man. He alerted you ASAP, was honest about the entire situation, and waited outside with the girls. It\u2019s not like he and/or the gf were doing drugs recreationally. It\u2019s reasonable to not let your daughter go over there or be around the gf for a while (or ever). Anything beyond that is unnecessary.", "YWBTA.\n\nWhat happened was an accident that everyone is already mortified about. I\u2019m pretty sure that they would have done anything they could to avoid being embarrassed to this point and having to call the police and have all the little ones panicked. I\u2019m also pretty sure they handled the situation the best they could and that they made sure your daughter and others would be safe, whatever the state of Moira. An appropriate reaction would be to refuse to have your daughter go there at any point now and require that Moira doesn\u2019t get close to your kid, for some time or forever. She probably has a strong treatment, but if you never noticed anything bizarre after meeting her 10 times, on treatment she\u2019s pretty normal.\n\nWhat\u2019s important now is how your daughter feels about it and how you can help reduce the size of any trauma she might have by talking it out with her and if it becomes necessary in the future, get her the help she needs. The world is a scary place and traumatic experiences/stories can happen everywhere unfortunately. I personally don\u2019t see any point in pressing charges, except breaking the friendship for your daughter. It was an accidents, and even though it looked frightening  and she insulted the kids, that\u2019s all that happened. Not nearly enough for any case.", "YTA\n\nYou can't decide to press charges against someone. That's up to the DA. You could file a police report for whatever crime you think happened, but I'm not sure what law you think is broken when an adult has an unexpected mental health crisis in front of teenagers and another adult promptly takes steps to ensure their safety and tell their parents what happened. Your reaction here is really unkind. I'm trying to imagine someone I care about having this kind of breakdown and then someone getting angry at *me* because they think it's something my family somehow wanted or chose.", "Since you've already stated that you've figured out how you want to proceed, I just wanted to add something (hopefully helpful) about your daughter. I haven't read all the comments, so I'm sorry if someone else has mentioned this or if you're already taking care of the situation.\n\nAna has every right to never want to go back there. She's only 13, and that can be a frightening experience. Just make sure to have a full discussion with her about what happened and how it happened and that she fully understands. It's a scary experience, but it shouldn't define Moira, Ken, or Haley and the relationship that she had with them.\n\nDefinitely wouldn't let my kid have any more sleepovers, but mainly due to the negligence of the situation. Anyone who regularly takes meds that lives in a house with someone else who takes meds should know to double-check the labels. Ultimately, this is something that could have happened at any time, but unfortunately happened with this sleepover taking place.\n\nI hope the kids involved, your daughter included, recover well from the situation! It sounds frightening, frustrating, exhausting, embarrassing, and overall upsetting.", "Info what charges are your pressing? Have you talked to like the DA?", "I have a lot of respect for your edit. Great job listening and being willing to apologize to Ken. That is certainly the right thing to do. \n\nBut please remember 13 is really hard. I\u2019m guessing Haley could really, really use a friend like Ana, especially after what happened. This was probably super hard on her. Please use this to teach Ana compassion about mental illness and invite Haley over to have a mini birthday re-do with a friend.", "YWBTA if you pressed charges. It was an accident and no harm was done. You have a right of being upset and perhaps you'll never send your daughter there again, but that's it.", "NTA, you were in mama bear mode.  I think you should meet up with Ken at some point and talk about everything.  I think this was a terrible accident, and I'd ensure they have taken steps to prevent another one in the future.\n\nMedication reactions happen and they can be scary AF.  I've seen them and unfortunately had my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Yes, you would be TA if you went through with calling the cops.", "What charges do you think you could press? It sounds like an uncomfortable and scary situation for the girls, but no crime was committed.", "YWBTAH if you press charges. You yourself said Ken is a responsible adult and he proved it by the way he handled the situation. Seeing that no one was physically harmed there likely wouldn't be anything to charge Moira with anyway. Assuming she has a legitimate condition that would bring on this behavior if not properly medicated, Moira is probably mortified over what happened.", "YTA. Why jump to pressing charges? This seems like the standard American knee jerk reaction. Your daughter is at the perfect age to learn why we 1) don't take pills prescribed for another 2) read labels before taking anything. Traveling to any major city will teach your daughter that people's unpredictable actions make a person uncomfortable. It's all about how you handle those situations. Not freaking press charges because you feel like you've lost control of her experiences. It sounds like the dad did the right thing. Address her trauma, help her understand and not blame. Learn and grow like adults should do.", "YTA. I actually would be checking on Ken and Haley. You owe him an apology.", "Traditionally you don't press charges, you file a complaint then depending on the jurisdiction the police or prosecutor charges the person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA but YTA at the same time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Ken's girlfriend accidently took Ken's daughter medication? First of all why isn't Moira looking at the container and reading the label that has Hailey's name on it.\n\nAt most people were yelling, that's not a crime. Moira is at fault for not reading the label to make sure it was her medicine, she could of poisoned herself.\n\nNo one assaulted anyone from what you said.\n\nYour parental instincts kicked in.\n\nI am not going to blame a 13 year old (Hailey) but people need to make sure what medicine they take.\n\nMoira should of looked at the label. If Hailey isn't responsible enough to make sure others don't take her medicine, why isn't Ken watching out?\n\nWhat if the other girls in the party confused Hailey's medicine as candy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst thing that happened there is Moira. I am assuming she is in her 30s or older.", "Lol, fake. Please inform us of what specific medicine would cause such outbursts? Preparation H?", "Wait but how did she accidentally take the wrong medication? If it\u2019s prescription medication they taken regularly, they should know where it is and what it looks like.", "NAH\n\nThis was indeed an unhappy event but no one meant for it to happen. Focus first on calming your child and maybe explaining consequences of taking the wrong meds. Try and look on it as a learning experience.\n\nTalk to Ken calmly and ask how this happened.  I would m.j pt press charges since the police already know and also, how does this help anyone?\n\nCalm yourself down. Yes, you were scared for your child but Ken did the right things. Easy does it.", "Lol, press charges?! You\u2019re out of your mind. YWBTA.", "NTA in either context. If the RX medications in question can have that bad of reaction, it is the adults responsibility to verify meds before you are distributing them, whether to yourself or others. And if Miora is on meds, then she should also be verifying what meds she is taking before she is taking them.... \n\nThis really doesn't seem like an accident.", "I think you need to make sure your daughter understands what happened and Moira\u2019s words and actions should be looked at as an illness and not to be taken personally.  If the girls come to terms with it all, who knows, maybe their empathy will mold them into an awesome health care worker. Ken felt bad. It was just a bad situation.  If a cat knocked over a candle at a sleepover and scared the girls with the fire, would you press charges?  Yes, this is worse because if this was my daughter, no one has ever spoken to her like that.  Up until two years ago, the kid thought \u201cstupid\u201d was the S word.  I\u2019m sure she would be upset about it for a while. Talking and processing helps. Her best friend maybe never even heard such harsh words before as Moira may have sense when lucid. And she\u2019s dealing with it and needs a friend.\n\nEveryone is upset. Take some time to cool off. And take your cues from the kids. De-escalate for them as they are learning the rules of life from you.", "I\u2019m not sure I buy the excuse that Moira was acting strange because she took a 13yo girl\u2019s medication.
