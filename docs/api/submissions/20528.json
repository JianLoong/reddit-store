I was asked to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and of course accepted because I love her and wanted to help celebrate her big day. During the months leading up to the wedding I bought several items for the wedding itself and paid for my portion of a bachelorette trip which was a joint trip with the groom and his groomsmen and a few added friends. The weekend of the trip came and we loaded up the car and set off to our destination. The whole rumor started that I attempted to sleep with one of the grooms friends on the trip, which was not true and had no logical basis. The rumor was started by another bridesmaid who was upset that me and the guy she was currently talking to used to have a relationship years ago and when he found out that I was on the trip he started asking her questions concerning me and my life at the present time. I have not spoken to this guy since we cut off contact 2 years ago. So she saw me conversing with one of the grooms friends at the bar we had gone to the first night of the trip. She took it upon herself to start saying that she saw me and this friend of the grooms who was married sneak off to the bathroom to hookup. This of course did not happen but with  this girl being a friend of the brides much longer than me the bride took her side and asked me to leave the bachelorette trip the next morning, in total I was on the trip for less than 24 hours. The trip was booked for 5 days. Later after the trip about a week before the wedding I texted the bride a question about the dress and was met with a long text about how I was no longer apart of the bridal party and would not be able to attend the wedding due to the rumors. She informed me that her whole family and the grooms family was uncomfortable with my being apart of the event due to the rumor and since the friend that I allegedly slept with was a long time friend of the grooms family he would not be uninvited. So am I the asshole for asking the bride to be reimbursed for the rest of the trip I was not allowed to stay for and the other charges I incurred for the sole purpose of being in her wedding?", "created_utc": 1687683003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ih9sd/aita_for_asking_for_my_money_back_after_getting/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is very disgustingly sexist, if you two HAD done something, why is it only you they\u2019re uncomfortable with? Are you both single? If so, it\u2019s really none of their business anyway. \n\nIf you or him aren\u2019t I can see a problem arising but honestly, again, it takes two to tango. The fact they are villianising the woman and the guy isn\u2019t even sticking up for what actually happened is disgusting. \n\nYou won\u2019t get your money back though. They\u2019re awful, through and through.", "Where was this groom's friend that you supposedly slept with and why didn't he say anything? \n\nAnyway, you can ask for your money back but just take the loss and delete these people from your life if everything you said is true. \n\nNTA", "NTA. These are shit friends", "NTA. \n\nThe only reason you agreed to the cost, was because you were originally intended to be part of said wedding. Since your \"friend\" don't want you in said wedding anymore and believes someone else, then she should not have any problems with paying you back. \n\nIf anything, she and her family are AH for not believing you.", "Absolutely NTA. What is wrong w the bride? While i understand that she might not want drama in her wedding, this is a rumour as a product of jealousy, and clearly untrue. \n\nAnd what about the groomsman why isn't he speaking up?", "Nta is your friend the morality police? My biggest question here is even if it were true what concern is it of the brides? You're best off out of there, get them venmos sent and use the cash to go do something for you. It all sounds very controlling and immature to me", "NTA! What did the bloke, you allegedly slept with, say? Or is he so precious that no one wanted to ask.... What an appaling double standard.... They definitely are not your friends and I would go full scorched earth \ud83e\udd23 I would ask for my money back, cry how my reputation has been ruined and other Gloria Swanson worthy handwringing. I would not really give a shit but sometimes it's fun not just let people get away with appaling behaviour.", "Honestly, I don't know how so many people go on these trips, get in some argument and get asked to leave, and then actually do. Once you're on the trip, you're much too close to the day to get any money back for most of the things you've already paid for, so I'd be finding the most scandalous clothes I could, and going to every thing I have to with the group like Diana in the revenge dress. Does Jenny wanna go over there, but she has to stick with the group? No worries, Jenny, I'll do it in front of your and you can die envious. Is everyone stuck going out to do a walking tour on a rainy day? That's fine, I've got a spa trip booked. Enjoy your soggy hair!", "Did the married guy get kicked out of the grooms party?

The bride can split the costs with the bridesmaid she should have dumped, the rumor-spreader.  You should demand reimbursement, an apology from the bride, her family, and the bridesmaid.  The bridesmaid should tell everybody exactly why she lied or pay you a large sum in damages.  And dump the bride as a friend.  She's awful.", "The groomsman is married. So he'd have cheated if they actually hooked up. But I guess OP is the horrible home wrecker, groomsman could hardly be blamed for succumbing to her womanly charms.\n\nI agree OP wouldn't get the money back even if she asked. I dunno what legal ground you'd have to get a refund. It would probably even give the bride and groom more ammunition against OP with mutual friends by telling them OP is demanding money off of them.", "No, he didn't.  The OP said he's still a groomsman because he's been friends with the groom's family for years. But, because of the rumors, one of them needed to be kicked out of the wedding party. \n\nThat situation is bs. If you need to kick someone out of the wedding party, make it the alleged cheater. That would be the same dude who didn't defend the OP.  \n\nNTA.  I'd demand the money back. If they refuse, consider small claims court. I'd love to see the on Judge Judy !"]}
