I have not spoken to this guy since we cut off contact 2 years ago. So she saw me conversing with one of the grooms friends at the bar we had gone to the first night of the trip.

So he'd have cheated if they actually hooked up. But I guess OP is the horrible home wrecker, groomsman could hardly be blamed for succumbing to her womanly charms.\n\nI agree OP wouldn't get the money back even if she asked. I dunno what legal ground you'd have to get a refund. It would probably even give the bride and groom more ammunition against OP with mutual friends by telling them OP is demanding money off of them.", "No, he didn't.  The OP said he's still a groomsman because he's been friends with the groom's family for years.

They believe this rumour but haven't told his wife?\n\n\nI 100% wouldn't do this (*but I'd be very tempted*) But I wonder what would happen if you reached out to this guy's wife, and said, \"I just thought you should be aware, your husband is a groomsmen in an upcoming wedding where Bridesmaid B circulated a **very false** rumour that me and your husband slept together on the bachelor trip. To be clear, I had a short conversation with your husband at the bar we were all having introductory drinks. I also spoke to all the other groomsmen. That is the extent of my interaction with the bachelor party before I was accused of having an affair. I wanted to give you a heads up, because I don't know why this bridesmaid fixated on your husband and started such a malicious rumour, but if I were you, I'd want to know what everyone was saying and believing about my marriage behind my back. The bride and bridesmaids believed it to be true to the extent they banned me from the wedding while sending me this text saying they are covering for your husband. To be clear, nothing inappropriate took place. I am sorry your marriage is being slandered to such an extent behind your back and I wish I could tell you why. I just thought you should know.\" \n\nThis would either force this Bridesmaid to double-down on the lie, looking increasingly shady as the groom's side vouch nothing happened. Or to immediately come clean facing the reality of this man wanting to know why she's lying on his marriage. There's also the possibility this man is a known serial cheater, and this makes you look worse.  NTA", "NTA at all but I doubt you\u2019ll get any money back. If you still have his number I\u2019d let your ex know exactly what kinds of lying manipulative woman the other bridesmaid is though!", "NTA These folks are not your friends. They sound awful.

That may get them to return the money. And, I mean this in the nicest way, tell them all to screw off.", "NTA. \n\nBe prepared for the next step though. I'd try and find a legal aid lawyer to see if you have legal recourse in a small claims court or something because the bride is absolutely 100% not going to give you your money back even though she should.", "Do you have small claims courts where you are?

Now think of when you heard a salacious rumor about someone you didn't really like or knew -you probably loved it and didn't even stop to think whether it was true or not because who cares??\n\nI'd keep it civil with the bride and avoid burning bridges, but she isn't your friend and probably feels like she doesn't owe you anything", "NTA", "Nta and if she say no , sue", "lol sorry meant to phrase that in an emphatic rhetorical way but it does seem like a sincere question\n\nfull agree about Judge Judy lmao", "How did it unfold when OP was forced out of the trip the next morning?

First off, a 5 day bachelor/ bachelorette trip.is already an over-the-top ask.  You paid for it.  The whole thing is ridiculous.  Speak to the bride in person, tell her again your side.

NTA, get your $ back.", "Nope NTA at all. Consider yourself lucky for getting rid of this friend now.

You wouldnt be the AH for asking for reimbursement", "NTA but what a fucked up situation that the jealous bridesmaid created and she hasn\u2019t been held accountable of anything. If she\u2019s capable of making up this rumour now, it sounds like it\u2019s part of her character and something nobody should be surprised over. And yet they believe her with no evidence.

Surely he\u2019d be denying it too as it could potentially ruin his marriage?  The bride is kicking OP out of the wedding based on an unsubstantiated rumor, and not bothered to check it out with the other person the rumor affects too?

When I was 15 years old, I was almost SA\u2019d by a man in his mid 20\u2019s at a family lake house. My uncle brought his girlfriend, who brought her 3 (adult) sons and their significant others. This man busted in on me when I was in the bathroom rinsing off in the shower. He was sitting on the toilet being creepy and I was trying to get him to leave, while also in shock. All of a sudden my cousin (same uncles daughter, 14y older than me) and the dude\u2019s girlfriend bust in. They start screaming *at me* calling me a whore, and all sorts of other inappropriate things I won\u2019t repeat. \n\nThe only thing I could think to do was run to where my grandparents were sleeping in the main house and wake them up (hyperventilating in tears). By the time my parents (had been sleeping in a different cabin) woke up the next morning the rumors were already flying. Another uncles flavor of the month ran around from cabin to cabin making everything worse. \n\nYou know what the adult man said?! I was blackout drunk and I don\u2019t remember anything. That was a totally acceptable answer for everyone from him. The only people who cared about the teenaged girl who had *just turned 15*, were my parents and grandparents. Its been 17 years and I still haven\u2019t spoken to my older cousin for what she did to me that night. For the record a 15 year old sober girl, who is just trying to spend time with her cousin, is NOT trying to take advantage of a 24-25 year old man who is there with his girlfriend. \n\nNTA It\u2019s mind blowing that women still have to deal with this shit!\n\nEdit to add: If I hadn\u2019t woken my elderly grandparents up at 1am that night and told them everything (while having a breakdown), nobody would have believed me when I told them what had happened come morning. My parents would have yes, but all those adults with my uncle and his girlfriend were already going around doing damage control with the whole family. Making up alternate stories to protect this spoiled ADULT man. My grandparents were the ones who put a stop to it. I was so afraid of this man that I wouldn\u2019t leave the main house all day long, until that group finally left. Absolutely disgusting and left a scar for sure.", "You won\u2019t get the money back, but I would go the wedding anyway.  Dress up in a clown suit and wander around the cocktail hour.  Stay near the photographer.", "Seriously, this is some of the most misogynist bull I've read in a long time.", "We\u2019ve been friends for a long time. You know me and should know this rumor isn\u2019t true. The fact that you\u2019re not actively trying to help me shows your true colors.", "She can chase after the girl who lied to get her money back.", "Have they actually asked the person who was allegedly with out hooking up if it actually happened?", "I like this. I like it a lot.", "I think this is a great idea.  This will put pressure where pressure for the truth is due.", "This perspective right here is something that needs to be said in many situations! Wow I\u2019ve never thought of it like this but you\u2019re kinda right. Even if it\u2019s not a don\u2019t really like OP it\u2019s a don\u2019t care enough to believe them or listen to their side or stand up to others for them. \n\nAlso I would like to add that in wedding situations it seems brides are always so worried about family opinions on things so much. So much f-img stress when that day isn\u2019t about them ugh", "Because the story isn't true. I really don't mind fiction on AITA but this one is lazy. \n\nHow does she know who started the rumor and why? The man she is accused of having slept with would tell everyone it didn't happen.", "like as long as you\u2019re not hitting on my actual husband,,", "This is the response I was looking for. Pretty sure none of these people are mature enough for marriage.", "How would you know that OP was leaving something out if you weren\u2019t directly involved?", "Yes this! HE is the married one and nobody blamed him. Even if something did happen, he is the one who took vows!! \n\nI also agree it is not right what happened to OP, but I don\u00b4t see legally how she could have a claim to get her money back. The bride and others are clearly all assholes and I think OP is just going to have to cut them off and move on. \n\nAlthough it would be tempting to do something petty involving the bridesmaids dress, I mean OP owns it so it is hers to destroy. I wouldn\u00b4t go to the wedding with it though because that is just giving the bride and the assholes more attention.", "I'm sorry this happened to you. Its amazing this kind of crap still goes on. I'd cut that cousin out forever. She'd be dead to me.", "She is also going to wreck someone's marriage by spreading this false rumour.", "I\u2019d go one step further and sue them for the cost spent plus extra for defamation.  Might not be successful but would definitely prove a point.", "This, why should the liar get away scots free! She needs some consequences.", " \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02", "I'd probably accept you're not getting the money back though and never speak to them again", ". Even when I was 20 and drunk id still notice if two of my friends went missing for an extended period of time.", " I'd probably accept you're not getting the money back though and never speak to them again,,,", "There\u2019s definitely no loss here as to if the bride is a friend anymore, but hell yeah get money back.", " Take their disgusting asses to the mat.", " I hope you get your money back and meet better friends in the future.", "She is also going to wreck someone's marriage by spreading this false rumour.", "True. You have to weigh up the pros and cons, but if everyone already believes you're a homewrecker, you can't cause any further damage to your reputation. Might as well be \"messy\" to force the truth to the surface, therefore clearing your name.", "Gather all your documentation and receipts and take the bride to small claims court.", " If you want to open the door to more vitriol from the bride,,", ">I 100% wouldn't do this (*but I'd be very tempted*) But I wonder what would happen if\n\nI say this in my comment. But also, if everyone believed your husband had cheated on you, to the point of ostracising the affair partner, you honestly wouldn't want to know? Would you prefer for all your friends to work together to hide it from you while smiling in your face?", "When she finds out the false rumour by herself and believes it, then it would be much worse for her marriage. The false rumours are being spread about her marriage, and she has the right to know about that.", "Nah fuck that, kick out the rumor spreading cow..", "Absolutely NTA. What is the fault of the bride? While I understand that he doesn't want drama in his marriage, this is a rumor as a product of jealousy and patently untrue.", "I would sue both the bride and the bridesmaid who started the rumor.", " I was asked to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and of course accepted because I love her and wanted to help celebrate her big day,,", "The rumor was started by another bridesmaid who was upset that me and the guy she was currently talking to used to have a relationship years ago,,,", "Thank you so much. It was super traumatizing, especially because it happened at a place surrounded by my family where I should have been the most safe. She has been dead since that day. It definitely opened my eyes about staying safe as a woman. \n\nYears later (when I was finally comfortable) I told the uncle who\u2019s lake house it was what really happened that night, and he was rightfully horrified. I don\u2019t think he really understood what had happened. His kids were super young and he had gone to bed with them. When my grandparents passed, my dad cut his brother out along with that cousin. There was no longer any reason to keep the peace. I would have felt (unfairly) guilty if it had just been because of me, but that uncle did some messed up things over the years too. He stole a lot of money and valuables from my gram while she was dying (but still alive). Like father like daughter I suppose. \n\nIt just makes me upset that women are still getting blamed and torn down for things, especially when it\u2019s by other women. Rumors (even far fetched ones) are soo damaging. This is how spoiled men who have never heard \u201cno\u201d before get away with terrible shit. It\u2019s not right and I really feel for OP. This isn\u2019t just about being uninvited to an event by her friends. This is about people actually believing OP is a home wrecking harlot, all because she dared to have a simple conversation with a married man. I would care less about the wedding/money, and more about the character assassination happening here.", "Dress up in a clown suit and wander around the cocktail hour.", "The wife has a right to know that people are gossiping about her and \"protecting\" her husband so she can choose for herself whether or not to nuke these relationships too. If nothing else it will make these horrible peoples' wedding WAY awkward and I'm petty like that. The relationships aren't salvageable, I say WRITE THAT TEXT!", "No, I don't engage in gossip and rumors, and I am not interested in hearing lies from scorned friends.", "Works for me !", "I think this is a great idea. I would probably accept that you are not getting a refund and not talk to them again", "Yes, isn\u2019t this slander?", "I want to point out the bride doesn't believe this is gossip and rumours. She 100% believes OP slept with her husband's married friend. She 100% believes her male friend used her joint bachelorette & bachelor celebration to cheat. And she plans to smile and greet her friends wife, knowing about this affair and saying nothing. With friends like that, who needs enemies??", "I think just the threat of suing would get her at least part of it back. A subpoena at the altar would be a special addition to the wedding.", "Lol @ you thinking the bride believes the rumor.", "I like your way of thinking.", "My biggest question here is what will brides think if this is true? You're the best out there, send them Venmo and use the cash to do something for you. It all sounds very controlling and immature to me", "I hope you get your money back and meet better friends in the future.", "If she didn\u2019t, why would she kick OP out of the wedding?"]}
