I have not spoken to this guy since we cut off contact 2 years ago. So she saw me conversing with one of the grooms friends at the bar we had gone to the first night of the trip. She took it upon herself to start saying that she saw me and this friend of the grooms who was married sneak off to the bathroom to hookup.

So he'd have cheated if they actually hooked up. But I guess OP is the horrible home wrecker, groomsman could hardly be blamed for succumbing to her womanly charms.\n\nI agree OP wouldn't get the money back even if she asked. I dunno what legal ground you'd have to get a refund. It would probably even give the bride and groom more ammunition against OP with mutual friends by telling them OP is demanding money off of them.", "No, he didn't.  The OP said he's still a groomsman because he's been friends with the groom's family for years.

They believe this rumour but haven't told his wife?\n\n\nI 100% wouldn't do this (*but I'd be very tempted*) But I wonder what would happen if you reached out to this guy's wife, and said, \"I just thought you should be aware, your husband is a groomsmen in an upcoming wedding where Bridesmaid B circulated a **very false** rumour that me and your husband slept together on the bachelor trip. To be clear, I had a short conversation with your husband at the bar we were all having introductory drinks. I also spoke to all the other groomsmen. That is the extent of my interaction with the bachelor party before I was accused of having an affair. I wanted to give you a heads up, because I don't know why this bridesmaid fixated on your husband and started such a malicious rumour, but if I were you, I'd want to know what everyone was saying and believing about my marriage behind my back. The bride and bridesmaids believed it to be true to the extent they banned me from the wedding while sending me this text saying they are covering for your husband. To be clear, nothing inappropriate took place. I am sorry your marriage is being slandered to such an extent behind your back and I wish I could tell you why. I just thought you should know.\" \n\nThis would either force this Bridesmaid to double-down on the lie, looking increasingly shady as the groom's side vouch nothing happened. Or to immediately come clean facing the reality of this man wanting to know why she's lying on his marriage. There's also the possibility this man is a known serial cheater, and this makes you look worse.  NTA", "NTA at all but I doubt you\u2019ll get any money back. If you still have his number I\u2019d let your ex know exactly what kinds of lying manipulative woman the other bridesmaid is though!", "NTA These folks are not your friends. They sound awful. Also why did she wait for you to ask a question to tell you.

That may get them to return the money. And, I mean this in the nicest way, tell them all to screw off.", "NTA. \n\nBe prepared for the next step though. I'd try and find a legal aid lawyer to see if you have legal recourse in a small claims court or something because the bride is absolutely 100% not going to give you your money back even though she should.", "Do you have small claims courts where you are?

Now think of when you heard a salacious rumor about someone you didn't really like or knew -you probably loved it and didn't even stop to think whether it was true or not because who cares??\n\nI'd keep it civil with the bride and avoid burning bridges, but she isn't your friend and probably feels like she doesn't owe you anything", "NTA", "Nta and if she say no , sue", "lol sorry meant to phrase that in an emphatic rhetorical way but it does seem like a sincere question\n\nfull agree about Judge Judy lmao", "How did it unfold when OP was forced out of the trip the next morning?
