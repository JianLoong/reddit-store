{"id": 8721, "submission_id": "10pfw1i", "title": "AITA for telling my fiancee that if he wants to cling onto his sister so much, he can marry her instead?", "selftext": "Backstory: Fiancee (33M) and I (34F) proposed 3 weeks ago and are planning on getting married in a few months, we met 3 years ago, hit it off, and now are planning a future. Fiancee had a horrible childhood, and sister was the only one to raise him. She practically views his sister as his role model, and is his best friend. I'm not sure how I think, but he says that his will to live was because of his sister, and how his whole life was only to begin with his sister\". Sister is currently in medical school overseas, hasn't seen him in person for over 5 years and came to visit for a week. Here's where the problem starts:\n\nOn the day of the arrival, Fiancee jolts up 3 hours ahead of her arrival, and has a big bash of gifts for his sister, and i'm talking 2 times the amount of gifts he bought me the 3 years we were together. He continuously asks me every 5 mins if he looks good, and how nervous he is after seeing sister for over 5 years. I keep assuring him he's fine. When sister finally arrived, he ran up to her and hugged her, crying his eyes out, something he had never shown me as an emotion. Sister was a great person in general, and gave us both big expensive gifts for our engagement. We went home that day chilling.\n\nThe next few days were ***hell***, all the things we did needed ***sister, and without sister we did nothing.*** \"Oh, you want to go skating, let me ask sister if it's okay.\" Sister was the one assuring us that the two of us should spend time together without her, as it's not fair for me, but my fiance insisted we do it together, since there's not a lot of time left.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday, when my sister was currently wrapping up something for school upstairs and we were watching a movie. Fiancee requested that the three of us watch a movie in the theater. I got pissed, I got up, screamed off at him saying \"if you want to cling onto your darn sister so much and do everything we should be doing alone together, go marry her instead\" and ranting on and on how we barely spend anytime to ourselves and how he's so persistent on spending time with her and not me. He started pleading for forgiveness, and tried justifying that he just wanted to spend time with someone he's never seen for over 5 years, and he's sorry for making me feel like that. I got mad, did not hear the rest of it, and left the house to my mom, not wanting to talk to him anymore.\n\nNow i'm getting tons of messages from him saying that he's sorry and he'll try to make alone time without his sister. From what I heard from his friends, he clinged onto his sister the whole time, crying on how guilty he feels. Sister reached out to me as well saying that she's sorry for making it seem like my needs were neglected, and she's willing to leave and go back so we can sort things out. I feel guilty as hell, but my needs were neglected the whole time.

You can go a whole week without being the center of the universe, I promise.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t give him a WEEK for his sister he hasn\u2019t seen in FIVE YEARS? Of course he\u2019s going to shower her in gifts, it\u2019s five years worth of gifts to the person who raised him. Of course he wants to spend time with her. You really can\u2019t give him a week of spending time with her? Again. You can\u2019t give her a WEEK?

How selfish can you get?\n\nWould I be correct in guessing that you are an only child?", "YTA. He hasn\u2019t seen her in 5 years and wants to spend as much time together for the time she is visiting, 1 week. Not 1 month or 1 year, 1 WEEK! Totally understandable.", "YTA. You sound extremely insecure. She's probably the most important person in his life, and you're mad he wants to spend time with her after not seeing her for FIVE FREAKING YEARS. Dude.", "Oh, buddy, YTA. His sister, who he hasn't seen for 5 years but is incredibly close with, comes to visit for a WEEK, and you are upset he's not doing activities alone with you? Then, instead of admitting to yourself that you're jealous (perfectly natural) and maybe calmly telling him that you're a bit jealous or calmly reminding yourself that it's just for a week, you freak out and scream at him? That's stage-5 clinger behavior, my friend, and throws up all sorts of red flags about you. It sounds like you would both benefit from some individual and couple's counseling, especially before you get married. Apologize to your fianc\u00e9 and learn to do better.", "YTA \n\n\nYou see him every day for 3 years. She's here for one week after not seeing her for 5 years. He should be spending every possible minute with her.

Go apologize for being selfish", "YTA. 33? REALLY.", "YTA, and I can't believe you have have the nerve to ask this question. You're incredibly immature, and I hope you apologize profusely to both your fianc\u00e9 and his sister for your terrible and inappropriate behavior, and insist that she stay and work to make the rest of her visit as pleasant as it should have been all along for the family member who practically raised your fianc\u00e9 through a difficult childhood. Yikes.", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t give him one week to spend time with his sister?  A sister he had not seen and been able to spend time with in 5 years!", "Poor man, he had a terrible childhood only to get into an abusive relationship. YTA and I hope he realizes it and leaves you.", "YTA  - he hasn\u2019t seen his sister in 5 years and wants to do stuff with her while she visits, seriously!?!?\n\nYou seem overly jealous, his sister is going away in a couple of days, you can\u2019t appreciate that he wants to spend time with the person who raised him, you\u2019re definitely the AH here.", "YTA. He hasn\u2019t seem his sister in 5 years. You seem jealous of the attention that he is giving her. If you want such attention from him, you should let him know. Actually, this should have been established before you decided to get married in order to see if your needs were met before committing to marriage.", "YTA Op, and you clearly aren\u2019t mature enough to get married. He hasn\u2019t seen his sister in 5 years and is excited to spend a week with her. Your \u201cneeds\u201d and let\u2019s be real it was your fragile ego couldn\u2019t handle not being the centre of attention for 7 days. I honestly hope he dumps you because you are horrible and don\u2019t deserve him, as you have the maturity of a child.", "YTA. He needs to leave you and be with someone that doesn\u2019t need to be center of attention.", "YTA it's 1 week and he hasn't seen her in 5 years wtf is wrong with you", "Yeah not surprising YTA. She\u2019s only around for a short amount of time of course your fiance would want to spend as much time with her as possible. You were so out of line and it\u2019s a miracle they apologized to you instead of demanding the apology", "YTA.  He hasn't seen his sister who raised him in 5 years and you're jealous that he wants to spend time with her and make a fuss of her? I hope he wakes up to the sort of person you are.", "YTA. He loves his sister. He hasn\u2019t seen her in years. Are you so needy that you can\u2019t sacrifice a day or two and allow him that?", "YTA, extremely insecure, selfish, attachment issues, see a therapist. You\u2019ve manipulated both these individuals who are lovely but the sounds of it. \nThey haven\u2019t seen each other in  years, they made it through and succeeded in life when they didn\u2019t have a childhood due to abuse. He wanted to spend time with his sister, had the courtesy of inviting you along when he really didn\u2019t have to on his reunion with his sister, you spent every waking minute with him, but you couldn\u2019t bare sharing his attention? \nYou should want to be spending time with the person who raised your partner not be jealous of them\u2026 you\u2019ve been in his life 3 years, she saved his life , protected him, taught him life skills and supported him be the person he is today, of course he\u2019s going to get emotional and want to spend time with her \nHe needs to leave you and be with someone who\u2019s supportive and secure in themselves.", "There are no words to describe how much you\u2019re an a-hole. I hope he leaves you honestly, you don\u2019t deserve him. YTA", "YTA. **It's his sister he hasn't seen in 5 years**. Of course they spend the entire time she visits together when she's only back for a single week. It was in fact fair for sister to monopolize 100% of his time while he's visiting, and you should have been an adult in their 30s about it.  \n\nHe shouldn't have apologized, you need therapy to be threatened by a man's family visiting for a single week, and you should reconsider any long-term relationships with the blatant lack of maturity to handle a NORMAL GOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS.", "Omg you're insufferable,  I hope your fiance see this. I hope he finds someone that he deserves,  you are not it. YTA and clingy is not a good look and I'm referring to you", "YTA. \nYou sound like you just blew a fuse at him after letting it boil over instead of addressing it early on.\nI can see he likely has missed his sister and wanted to do as much with her as possible while she was there with you two. I do think you should apologise to him for the way you went off and address that you have felt like your relationship was pushed aside.\n\nEdit: you\u2019re going to have to remember your future husband is part of your life but you don\u2019t get to take each others entire time up and doing things with others is actually fun as a couple.", "YTA how insecure can you be to get jealous of his sister that he hasn't seen in 5 years. I hope you are not this needy and controlling the rest of the time.", "YTA- you are childish and clingy. He hasn\u2019t seen her for 5 YEARS, she is there for a week, and he is trying to get the most of the time she has there. You want to complain because you aren\u2019t the center or attention? You\u2019re comparing gifts and his emotions when he saw her\u2026 it sounds like you are petty and jealous, honestly.", "YTA You are acting selfish and immature.  He hasn't seen his sister for 5 years and she's a guest, when you have guests you are suppose to spend time with them.  It's crazy that you are jealous of his sister, is he not allowed to have relationships with people other than you? You're not ready for marriage.", "Ew you're the worst! You know his history and you're still so self-centered that you can stand his attention being on his sister while she's visiting. I feel sorry for your fiance. YTA", "YTA\n\nFrom their reaction of falling all over themselves to appease your ego and stop ***your*** verbal and emotional abuse, they quickly fell back into survival mode.  I hope your fiancee quickly realizes he's chosen his mother figure in an attempt to prove to himself one can be treated horribly and still be loved. \n\nHe needs to run away like his tampon string is on fire.", "YTA\n\nIf his sister was living closer to him and he saw her more than a few times a year, I would completely agree with you. But she is visiting for a week after he hasn't seen her for 5 years. Can you really not understand that your fiance might want to spend as much time with his sister as possible?", "YTA. He hasn't seen her FOR FIVE YEARS. He's looking to include her in pretty normal activities for the short time she's there. This visit is a big deal for him and it's sad you got inappropriately jealous instead of super happy for him. Chill out.", "You really can't let someone else be the (co-)center of your partner's attention for ONE week?! And that person is his best friend/closest relative/person who raised him?! The fact that it's been 5 years since he's seen her is the cherry on top of the reasons why you are an AH. \n\nYour codependency isn't cute and neither is the temper tantrum you threw.  If I were your fianc\u00e9e, I would be rethinking this relationship.\n\nIf it wasn't clear, YTA, and you should prob get a grip or go to therapy or something.", "YTA, I'm sorry. You are in for a long road ahead if you expect to dominate your future husband's time for the remainder of your lives.", "YTA, and a big one at that.\n\nHis sister is the closest thing to him, someone he hasn't seen within the past 5 years, someone who based on your response, is a great person.\n\n>his will to live was because of his sister, and how his whole life was only to begin with his sister\n\nDon't break the bond between two close people, you'll be the asshole for it.  we need to work on some boundaries here, as he deserves to spend time with his sister as much as you do with distant family members.\n\n>Now i'm getting tons of messages from him saying that he's sorry and he'll try to make alone time without his sister. From what I heard from his friends, he clinged onto his sister the whole time, crying on how guilty he feels. Sister reached out to me as well saying that she's sorry for making it seem like my needs were neglected, and she's willing to leave and go back so we can sort things out. I feel guilty as hell, but my needs were neglected the whole time. AITA?\n\nSERIOUSLY?? BLESS THOSE TWO, THEY DESERVE THE WORLD. \n\nYTA, and I hope your fiancee notices everything you're showing with this one week interaction.", "YTA - \n\nShe sounds like an amazing person. Not only did she overcome a shitty childhood that forced her to take care of her sibling but she made it all the way to medical school. She also supported your guy after you threw a tantrum and even reached out to you. She could have absolutely turned him against you in this situation but she didn\u2019t. \n\nYou sound incredibly jealous and of course TA. If she lived closer and this was a weekly thing I could empathize but she was only there for a week.", "YTA\n\nHe hasn\u2019t seen his sister in YEARS and finally gets to see how and you make the entire visit about you and your feelings? That\u2019s BS. You are also a horrible host. You should be the one asking for their forgiveness.", "YTA he hasn\u2019t seen his sister in 5 years and you call him clingy? Hopefully he\u2019ll come to his senses and dump you", "Holy shit, dude, **YTA** \\- this poor guy had a terrible childhood, she raised him and is of course very important to him, they haven't met in five years, and you can't even suck it up for ONE *WEEK*?! Get over yourself, you big baby, and have some compassion for the man whom you claim to love. I hope the wedding never happens, and he finds someone worthy. I don't care how you end up.", "You aren't mature enough for marriage. YTA\n\nEdit: Ive just looked at your ages. You aren't mature enough to get married.", "YTA- Please see a therapist.", "YTA and extremely insecure. You couldn't spend a week without all attention on you and its pathetic. He hadn't seen his sister who he basically views as a parental figure for 5 years and you shame him for being excited for it? You're a desperate excuse for a fiance and if he has any sense he'll kick you to the curb.", "She was there for a week? And you acted like this after\u2026a week? YTA.", "Yta. It was one week after 5 years.", "Are you a kid? Are you really that jealous of his sister? A person who he hasn't seen in 5 years, who raised him and you're demanding his time and Are basically jealous of her. Grow up. YTA", "YTA. She's visiting--she's not moving in. You can stop being so clingy for a few days/weeks. It's not your whole life. \n\nThat being said, you should make sure it won't be your whole life. That would be horrible if it was every day for the next 50 years.", "YTA and you sound exhausting, entitled, and creepily jealous. Couldn\u2019t go a week without being the center of attention huh? Sad. I hope this opens his eyes to you.", "Super YTA, come on a week without being the center of his universe for a woman who practically raised your BF made you jealous... those are some hard insecurities you got right there, not to mention the poor guy even went with your rant and apologized and you didn't even listened to him, both the guy and the sister are angels for tolerating your bs, sorry but after not seeing a dear relative for five years, what's wrong with a few days of his wanting to spend time with his sister, the sister didn't even do anything wrong for you to not want to spend time with her and the bf didn't leave you aside, he just included his sister in plans.", "YTA. A huge one. He hasn't seen his sister in person for 5 whole years, she's there for only one short week, and you're throwing a tantrum because he wants to spend as much time as possible with her during that extremely short period? What are you, 5? That is extremely selfish and I hope your fianc\u00e9 is re-evaluating your entire relationship at this point. They're only getting 7 days together and you've nearly bullied her into leaving early. You're not even trying to understand how important she is to him because you're too busy turning this into a competition about who he loves more. Unbelievable.", "Wow.. YTA.", "YTA. Calm yourself down.", "YTA. He seems like a nice gentleman, I hope he finds a nice lady to marry.", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s his family. For a time, she was his ONLY family. It\u2019s normal and healthy for us to depend on lots of people. \n\nYou are not supposed to be the center of his universe- you are one planet of many. His sister is not a threat to you. The fact that he wanted to catch up with her doesn\u2019t mean that he wanted to ignore you. Him getting gifts for the sibling he hasn\u2019t seen in 5 years doesn\u2019t mean that the gifts he\u2019s given you over the last 3 mean nothing. \n\nYou and his sister and both important people in his life and you play very different roles in supporting and loving him. \n\nThis black and white thinking will not benefit you in the long run. It will damage your relationships.", "wow i'm speechless, i think your fianc\u00e9 should marry everyone but you i really hope he realizes soon that things won't end well with you. please seek help YTA!", "YTA she came to see him for ONE WEEK after not seeing him for FIVE YEARS and you're upset because he wanted to spend time with her while she's here? You sound unreasonable and unpleasant.", "YTA \nIts such a short time and you expect him not to be excited, hug her etc???\n\nThat's his guardian, the person that took care of him for so long and you expect him to just fistbump her or something?\n\nOf course he's going to do a bunch of things with her, give her presents, watch movies, and more.\n\nIt was a WEEK.\n\nDid you not understand how special that was for him OP?", "I\u2019m having a very hard time believing you\u2019re 33.  You think his sister is cool but it\u2019s HELL if you can\u2019t pull him away from her for an hours long thing like a movie without her?  She\u2019s there for 7 days. One week, and you can\u2019t let this week be about her?  She even brought you both big expensive gifts.  What you did was manipulative, childish, and insanely codependent.  You are not the main character, but YTA!", "This post will get deleted soon . \ud83d\ude02", "WOW YTA, you just said she was who raised him and he is incredibly close to her (and considering what they went through at younger ages together that is completely understandable) and you couldn\u2019t just look at the big picture for a little bit and understand that he is excited to share this time with both of you? Maybe he just wants you to get to know and love her as much as he does? The fact that you lost your head at him and they BOTH apologized and validated how you feel and offered to accommodate your incredibly bratty attitude is astounding and I would go back begging for forgiveness for such childish behaviour. Do you always only consider your own needs/wants in your relationship?", "YTA. She's only back for a week and you can't handle sacrificing some alone time so he can get the most out of the time she's here? When she hasn't been back in 5 years and who knows when she'll be back again?", "YTA. It's been five years since he ha last saw his MOTHER FIGURE. And you couldn't take a week without him giving you attention? He wants to spend as much time as possible with someone he doesn't see often.\n\nYou could have calmly asked for a moment between you both or talked a bit how you miss spending time with just him.\n\n>I feel guilty as hell, but my needs were neglected the whole time. \n\nGuess what, your needs aren't as important as your fianc\u00e9's. And he needed this week with his sister.", "YTA he hasn't seen her in 5 years! They only have a short amount of time together so of course he wants to include her in everything. Alone time? You guys had 3 years of alone time. You owe both of them an apology. You are selfish, heartless, and very insecure. This woman raised him, kept him alive, you both should be excited to spend time with her, without her he wouldn't be here.", "YTA. I, too, had a horrible childhood, where my sister was my only protectorate. I spoke to my sister five times a day as an adult, and when she passed suddenly, I felt like I couldn't breathe for at least a year. It literally felt like someone removed one of my lungs. You clearly are selfish and immature, as you don't see that this is someone who both loves him and wants him to be happy. He hasn't seen her in five years, yet you act like a baby because he wants to cherish every minute with her.\n\nI hope to God that he realizes that you are one giant marinara flag and breaks it off with you. How self-centered and bratty you are.", "It\u2019s a week and he hasn\u2019t seen his sister in 5 years of course he wants to spend time with her. Sounds like you\u2019re the clingy one", "YTA and hopefully your fianc\u00e9 sees that before becoming your husband. He could do so much better.", "He's seeing his sister for the first time in 5 years, is understandably excited and you're getting petty and jealous about that? \nGrow up. \n\nHe's allowed to be happy to see her after so long and you have no right to try to cut down the amount of time they spend together.  \nAlso, she is going to be your sister in law. Did it ever occur to you that he might be trying to have a good relationship build up between you and her? She's going to be family, and you acting like you think she's going to steal him away is going to serious damage how she perceives you.", "YTA your jealous and petty behaviour towards him caring for someone other than you is a huge red flag and I really hope he realises that before it\u2019s too late", "YTA.  He hasn't seen her in FIVE YEARS and only gets one week with her before she leaves, yet you're worrying about how much time he's spending with YOU during that week?  \n\nSomeone in this story absolutely has a clinging issue, but it's not your fiance.", "YTA - his sister was there for 7 days. Of COURSE everything would revolve around her. They have 5 years to make up for.  You weren\u2019t left alone, you weren\u2019t excluded. You just weren\u2019t the centre of attention for a single week.", "YTA cannot believe you still have a fianc\u00e9 after the hissy fit you threw. He hasn\u2019t seen his sister in 5 years, she was like a mother to him, he feels like he owes her his life and you can\u2019t put your jealousy aside for 7 days? I hope he rethinks the relationship and walks away. FYI if I was him I would have shown you the door.", "YTA, big time. His sister, who he hasn't seen in 5 years, who raised him and gave him a will to live, came to visit for a week. That's not a lot of time, so of course he's going to want to spend as much time with her as possible. The fact that your fiance even wanted to include you shows he still cares about you. Unfortunately it doesn't look like you care about him at all", "Yta you need therapy", "YTA, holy shit lady, she was there for a week. A week. He hasn't seen her in 5 years. Frankly, I consider it rude as hell that you expected to go off and do things without her when she was only there for a WEEK.\n\nYou sound bitter, possessive, and jealous. Your poor fiance.", "mmmmm \u2026 YTA I can understand wanting to spend some alone time with your fianc\u00e9 but do understand he hasn\u2019t seen his sister in over 5 years, she\u2019s only staying for a week  and she\u2019s been quite compliant and kind. On the other hand it\u2019s YOU who has a problem with needing to be the center of attention. I feel as though this could\u2019ve been avoided if you SIMPLY SAT DOWN WITH YOUR FIANC\u00c9 AND TALKED IT OUT. simply a \u201chey I feel neglected and I want some attention too, I understand you missed you sister but I want to do activities  with you too. Could we set aside some time for us to bond?\u201d But no OP you decided to rage and take it out on your fianc\u00e9 and his sister, like a kid having a tantrum. Do better\u2026", "YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. Your jealousy over your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister is palpable. I suggest you dump this vitriol and not revisit it as it could permanently taint your relationship with both your fianc\u00e9 and his sister.", "YTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t seen his sister in 5 years.  For whatever reason, she raised him.  Naturally, he will want to cherish the time he has with her because he has no idea when he will see her again.  It sounds like his sister wants to get along with you too since you will become her brother-in-law.  Let him have this one week.  There are 51 other weeks for you two to enjoy each other.", "YTA. You have a lot of maturing to do before you are ready for marriage.", "YTA - you sound very insecure, admittedly your partner also sounds like he has some unresolved trauma resulting in insecure relationships. But he's not yelling and screaming at anyone for trying to spend time with family.", "Wow this went in a whole other direction than I originally thought. \n\nYTA in the biggest way I can imagine. Your poor fianc\u00e9.", "YTA,\n\nI mean he obviously has some stuff he needs to work out from his shitty past. But being as the sister is very well adjusted and even tried to encourage him to loosen his grip, I think you should have been a little more patient for company's sake. His poor sister did not deserve that drama. It could have been something you guys talked about after she left.", "YTA for the following reasons:\n\n1. They haven't seen each other for 5 years.... longer than you have been DATING! Of course he wants to spend every waking hour with her.\n\n2. She sounds amazing and you are being the biggest brat of epic proportions. If anything, you should encourage THEM to spend more time together. That he wants to include YOU means he wants you to get to know each other.\n\n3.

I can't imagine you three are all together 24 hours/day. Do you get your bedroom alone together in the morning and at night? Do you still get to talk to him? I reckon yes.\n\nI'm concerned about how quickly your attitudes soured over SIL, starting before she even got there. Instead of being happy seeing fiance happy, you've given into jealousy and possessiveness. And I grant that it must hurt to see him be so emotional and thrilled about seeing her when it seems he isn't the same with just you, but the circumstances are so different: She gave him life and finally went to take care of herself and her career for half a decade, which is a severing of a deeply important relationship and a big change for them both, while (respectfully) you are a relatively new addition, and similarly important to your fiance, but you've also been there every day for 3 years. \n\n behavior is normal, yours is not. He probably still wants to marry you, nothing has changed forever, and SIL is not replacing you.

There is no way you can actually love him with how unbelievably self absorbed you are. If you did you would have made sure they got to spend as much time as humanly possible before she had to leave.

If you\u2019re going to stick around, you probably owe both of them an apology.\n\nAlso, why are you comparing your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 to his relationship with his sister? That\u2019s kind of strange.", "YTA it's been 5 years since he got to see his sister. Yeah, he will want to do things with her. Don't you want to get to know someone so important to your fiance? This should be a big red flag for him. You always like me me me?", "I hope he changes his mind about marrying you because you sound insecure and selfish as hell.", "YTA.

Grow up.", "\"I feel guilty as hell\"\n\nAnd... doesn't that feeling tell you something?\n\nThis sort of self-centered, clingy, attention-seeking behavior is not becoming of a man of your age.

Get help.", "You're not an asshole but give the dude a break.", "YTA \n\nYou're clingy and overly needy but just plain jealous!\n\nDude he hasn't seen his sister in person for 5 years.... FIVE years.  This person raised him. And you can't contain yourself so he can spend time with her. And after that long apart, you think he's not going to be overly excited and want to spend what time he can before she leaves again.\n\nWorst part is your jealousy and insecurities are making them feel guilty for doing nothing wrong. You need to grow up and get some therapy.", "YTA You sound very immature and self-centered. You couldn't share your fianc\u00e9 for one freaking week? How selfish and immature. One week out of your life you couldn't make someone else a priority in your life. It is too bad your BF is apologizing. You should be the one apologizing for being a self-centered AH.", "I don't think AH quite describes what an insanely awful person you are.\n\nYour man clearly has a lot of respect for his sister.  His sister clearly made so many selfless sacrifices to raise him when nobody else would.  As stated, she saves his life.

To say that to someone's face is appalling.  \n\nBro, maybe there's a reason why he doesn't give you that many gifts.  The fact that you keep track of how much he's spending on any given person compared to you -- gross.  \n\nThe fact that all it takes is ONE WEEK for you to turn into a cruel, vindicative AH is so telling os what is in store for him.  You two have the rest of your lives together, but you can't go just a few days with him wanting to be with someone other than you.\n\nYou're not ready for a relationship.  You aren't mature enough, you aren't emotionally stable enough, and you aren't compassionate enough.

I understand feeling jealous especially since you hadn\u2019t met her before, these types of emotions towards you SO siblings can be common but you should have reflected on these emotions. This shows your emotional immaturity. You need to self reflect on why YOU feel insecure about your husband\u2019s sister.

So much so!!", "YTA and not ready to be married.", "YTA!!! \n\nThis man had all of his emotional needs fullfilled by his sister to the point where he started to view her as a mother figure.

Most partners would say: how much time do you need with her? \n\nWhat happened here was you and he did not communicate well before she came. Then you blew up because you were jealous. His sister knows how much he clings to her. Before she leaves, you need an adult sitdown to hash this out. He needs to hear that he now has two people on his side.

I really really hope your fianc\u00e9 rethinks this relationship because this is the most overreaction I have seen in a while.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nBackstory: Fiancee (33M) and I (34M) proposed 3 weeks ago and are planning on getting married in a few months, we met 3 years ago, hit it off, and now are planning a future. Fiancee had a horrible childhood, and sister was the only one to raise him. She practically views his sister as his role model, and is his best friend. I'm not sure how I think, but he says that his will to live was because of his sister, and how his whole life was only to begin with his sister\". Sister is currently in medical school overseas, hasn't seen him in person for over 5 years and came to visit for a week. Here's where the problem starts:\n\nOn the day of the arrival, Fiancee jolts up 3 hours ahead of her arrival, and has a big bash of gifts for his sister, and i'm talking 2 times the amount of gifts he bought me the 3 years we were together. He continuously asks me every 5 mins if he looks good, and how nervous he is after seeing sister for over 5 years. I keep assuring him he's fine. When sister finally arrived, he ran up to her and hugged her, crying his eyes out, something he had never shown me as an emotion. Sister was a great person in general, and gave us both big expensive gifts for our engagement. We went home that day chilling.\n\nThe next few days were ***hell***, all the things we did needed ***sister, and without sister we did nothing.*** \"Oh, you want to go skating, let me ask sister if it's okay.\" Sister was the one assuring us that the two of us should spend time together without her, as it's not fair for me, but my fiance insisted we do it together, since there's not a lot of time left.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday, when my sister was currently wrapping up something for school upstairs and we were watching a movie. Fiancee requested that the three of us watch a movie in the theater. I got pissed, I got up, screamed off at him saying \"if you want to cling onto your darn sister so much and do everything we should be doing alone together, go marry her instead\" and ranting on and on how we barely spend anytime to ourselves and how he's so persistent on spending time with her and not me. He started pleading for forgiveness, and tried justifying that he just wanted to spend time with someone he's never seen for over 5 years, and he's sorry for making me feel like that. I got mad, did not hear the rest of it, and left the house to my mom, not wanting to talk to him anymore.\n\nNow i'm getting tons of messages from him saying that he's sorry and he'll try to make alone time without his sister. From what I heard from his friends, he clinged onto his sister the whole time, crying on how guilty he feels. Sister reached out to me as well saying that she's sorry for making it seem like my needs were neglected, and she's willing to leave and go back so we can sort things out. I feel guilty as hell, but my needs were neglected the whole time. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why? What\u2019s the competition? The real question I have is why were YOU there the whole time? Why didn\u2019t the siblings get some one on one time? It\u2019s so sad to read that he\u2019s falling over himself to apologize to your cold ass because he has abandonment issues that you are well aware of and currently exploiting.
