He had his own life when he was pretty young. He married young and our family (parents and I) barely kept in contact with him. There were no disagreements, fights etc. He didn't cut us off, but never made any attempts to keep in contact and always rejected any invitations for family meals etc. He only hinted a few times that his wife didn't like our family too much. The only time we saw his kid in person was out at a shopping mall by chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo over the past few years, my mum's health has worsened, requiring surgery and extra care. I got my folks to move in myself and my wife as it would be easier on them, along with getting professional care services in the daytime. I've always updated my brother from time to time about the situation but he has never visited in person and has only sent the odd fruit basket here and there.\n\n  \nRecently, I shared with my parents that we were looking to sell our current house to finance an upgrade to a bigger house in a better area. My dad stopped me and said there was no need to as they were able to finance that as they were selling off some properties they had (my parents were not wealthy. They were middle class folks who bought some properties while they were dirt cheap). My parents spoke abit about their plans and said that my brother would be receiving half too.  \n\n\nI honestly got pissed off and questioned their decision given his utter lack of existence in the past 20 years. My parents said that at the end of the day, he is still their son and it is only fair to do so. I said that by giving him half, I'm put at a disadvantage to him given what I had done over the past few years. I told them that I didn't care about about his half of the inheritance and asked them to consider donating his half away.   \n\n\nI found it extremely insulting to be at the end of the day, valued the same as my brother. One could say value goes beyond monetary items but I feel that action speaks louder than words. My wife chided me for being so confrontational about it, but idk man, this feels ridiculous.

Allowing them to give him equal $ makes you feel like the care you provide them (and stress it causes you) is meaningless, so why are you bothering? Like I said, no win situation. I would suggest taking a deep breath, let your parents do what they want with their $. Think of it as a donation to a charity or a hobby you don't care about. And see about setting up an appt with a therapist to help with the stress and eventually, the effects of their passing. If you can manage it, call your brother and have a blunt, but polite, conversation about how his distance is affecting you/them and that you'd appreciate more of his involvement since you are all also his family. Don't mention the $, it's not the real problem and will only provide cover for him to squeak out of changing his behavior. If you're very, very lucky, he just hasn't realized how severe things have been or how much you're shouldering, responsibility-wise. But honesty, it is unlikely this conversation will go well, or anything will change. This is why I recommend therapy.
