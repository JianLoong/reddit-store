He had his own life when he was pretty young. He married young and our family (parents and I) barely kept in contact with him. There were no disagreements, fights etc. He didn't cut us off, but never made any attempts to keep in contact and always rejected any invitations for family meals etc. He only hinted a few times that his wife didn't like our family too much. The only time we saw his kid in person was out at a shopping mall by chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo over the past few years, my mum's health has worsened, requiring surgery and extra care. I got my folks to move in myself and my wife as it would be easier on them, along with getting professional care services in the daytime. I've always updated my brother from time to time about the situation but he has never visited in person and has only sent the odd fruit basket here and there.\n\n  \nRecently, I shared with my parents that we were looking to sell our current house to finance an upgrade to a bigger house in a better area. My dad stopped me and said there was no need to as they were able to finance that as they were selling off some properties they had (my parents were not wealthy. They were middle class folks who bought some properties while they were dirt cheap). My parents spoke abit about their plans and said that my brother would be receiving half too.  \n\n\nI honestly got pissed off and questioned their decision given his utter lack of existence in the past 20 years. My parents said that at the end of the day, he is still their son and it is only fair to do so. I said that by giving him half, I'm put at a disadvantage to him given what I had done over the past few years. I told them that I didn't care about about his half of the inheritance and asked them to consider donating his half away.   \n\n\nI found it extremely insulting to be at the end of the day, valued the same as my brother. One could say value goes beyond monetary items but I feel that action speaks louder than words. My wife chided me for being so confrontational about it, but idk man, this feels ridiculous.

Allowing them to give him equal $ makes you feel like the care you provide them (and stress it causes you) is meaningless, so why are you bothering? Like I said, no win situation. I would suggest taking a deep breath, let your parents do what they want with their $. Think of it as a donation to a charity or a hobby you don't care about.

He had no curfew, he had no real wants or needs. He was seen as the saint while literally all the shit he did was blamed on me. I see op's brother's potential side in all of this because it sounds very similar to my family situation in the vaguest of senses.  He goes on expensive vacations with my mother, yet she has literally never offered anything remotely similar to us.  When you spend your whole life gutted and neglected, your spouse, friends, and even kids see how you're better off without those painful reminders of what your neglectful childhood actually was and how you scraped by tooth and nail all on your own while the other sibling was literally treated wholly different. \n\nI am leaning Op isn NTA, but that's only because he was left out of the loop and *something* happened to their brother they aren't aware of or just never really noticed.", "I disagree. You're always free to tell people how you feel about something.

The excuses he uses are ridiculous but he still makes an effort to reply.", "I don't know man, what if OP stops doing anything for his parents and goes NC too?\n\nAt the end of the day he will get the same as his brother so why burden himself?\n\nI feel like he has a point, he was their for his parents all this time so he deserves a little more. Not saying that the brother shouldn't get anything but half is too much.\n\nYou might say, as a child he needs to take care of his parents and don't expect anything in return but what about his brother? He didn't do anything for the past 20 years yet he gets the same.", "Honestly I would also be resentful of someone behaving like that. The brother obviously has his reasons to be the way he is. He is within his human right to be however he likes as long as he doesn't hurt anyone in the process (in this case he doesn't tho I'm sure it feels like he does).\n\nBut there's the universal principle, treat others how you want to be treated. I hope that brother is at least aware of the consequences of his actions and doesn't expect to receive help from his family if he ever needs it. And we can only guess what his own child will grow to be like.\n\nNAH\n\nSorry, I feel compelled to add that one of my grandmothers was like that, she was completely non-contact all the first 20 years of my life, until her death. I often wondered if she was alive or maybe she died before I was even born, and I didn't ask my parents because if she was alive, I didn't want to know that. I only learnt the answer when she died.

Like, I get what you\u2019re saying, but OP suggested that his parents donate the brother\u2019s portion.

It\u2019s basically a direct retelling of the prodigal son parable.", "Whoa I don\u2019t like that sentiment :( giving care deserves a reward?

You've had a heavy burden being your parents' caretaker and I respect the hell out of you for it.\n\nIt's very possible that your parents are hurting deeply about their estrangement from your brother. When they make excuses for him not showing up, I'd guess it's because it hurts them. They'd rather latch onto a weak excuse rather than believe that one of their sons wants nothing to do with them.\n\nFor them, emotionally, making the inheritance unequal would be like setting that relationship balance in stone. It would be admitting that their relationship with him will never recover. I think it would be very hard as a parent to come to terms with that.\n\nSo, maybe I'm projecting because I love and miss my parents, one of whom is in the hospital right now. But please don't take their unwillingness to accept their estrangement from your brother as devaluing all the years of time and effort and love you've spent caring for them. I'm sure that they know and are grateful for what you've done for them, and their feelings about their relationship with your brother are entirely separate from that.\n\nBest of luck to all of you.", "I'm like your sibling.

That\u2019s money and time that isn\u2019t going to OP\u2019s family because he and his wife are footing the bill and doing all the work. \n\nI think OP needs to stop fronting the costs.  Parents can sell off one property and start kicking down for the cost of larger accommodations and general living expenses. THEN the remaining property can be split evenly.

My mother is like this, and I put it down to the fact that my love isn\u2019t enough for her and because it\u2019s always been given it\u2019s almost the norm.

During the past 20 years, has he not enjoyed the love and care of his parents, appropriate gifts at appropriate occasions, wedding gifts etc. that the brother by the virtue of his absence has not received? Why should suddenly the ongoing love OP has received from his parents all this time count for nothing just because there's a bigger lump sum payment on the horizon?", "Ahh I see! Understood", "but one of the children *took on* this responsibility while the other didnt\n\nthat should certainly be acknowledged", "NTA - I understand you as you describe your brother being absent from your lifes and not helping at all. I was shocked hearing that your parents met their grandson by chance at a mall.  Of course its their money, but I believe that the one who does not help at all doesn't deserve to be paid. Would it be ok for you if the money went into a trust for your nephew?", "I don't think your brother should be cut out of this but if you have been putting in more time and effort to help your parents, you ought to receive a larger share.  For example, when my mother died, she left five shares to four children - my sister received two shares, because she had put in so much effort to care for my mother in the last few difficult years of her life and was made the executor of her will.  That seemed fair to me.", "NTA OP", "Yta and you are not entitled to any inheritance, and the way you phrase it you only took care of them in hopes of getting everything.", "NAH", "NAH. I would feel the same way. You should have a discussion and say it felt like they have not acknowledged the help and support you went out of your way to give. It feels like they're placing you equally, when brother hasn't supported them but you have - and it feels like that devalues your love and service to them as if it makes no difference (and therefore is not valued) in their eyes. I certainly could not respect a sibling who did that, or consider us \"family\" in any meaningful way. \n\nBut at the end of the day, ultimately it is their choice. Knowing this and sensing you feel like you put a lot of energy into caring for them, does it change the way you see the future?

Your value is not determined by money, and it\u2019s really two dimensional of you to think that a dollar amount is placed on the worth of yourself or your brother. Furthermore, why are you expecting some sort of pay out for being a good daughter or expecting your brother to be given less because you think you\u2019re better than him? Just back up a step and realize that your parents loved equally and that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not about material worth.", "NTA.

And in some ways I can understand that.  Pretending like \"Oh he's just busy\" and keeping the inheritance 50-50 is just to keep up their denial because facing the truth is just too painful. \n\nOP you now need to do what is in your best interests and what is best for your mental health.  Your brother has made it very clear he doesn't care, so stop messaging him. Stop giving updates, stop asking for help.  If your parents want to be in touch with him, then let them.

You don't need anyone here to validate your hurt and frustration. However, your parents are entitled to bequeath an equal inheritance to their other child. Have you asked to be compensated as a caretaker? Of course you do this out of love but perhaps framing it that way will allow your parents to get past their mental hurdle of keeping things equal. It is a common tactic and gives a justifiable \"excuse\" in these situations. Regardless, you coming to peace about this will bring you peace and prevent resentment toward the other parties to this situation, which ultimately hurts you the most.", "YTA \n\nTheir money, their property, their choice.

Thats a typical parent response to not turn their back on a child even if said child behaved like your brother.  Your brother's behavior was not nice but your parents are operating on the principle of 2 wrongs dont make a right.

If they are so set on leaving something to your brother, they first need to calculate the value of the caretaking provided by you. That comes right off the top of the pot.
