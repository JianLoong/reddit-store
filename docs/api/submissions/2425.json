He had his own life when he was pretty young. He married young and our family (parents and I) barely kept in contact with him. There were no disagreements, fights etc. He didn't cut us off, but never made any attempts to keep in contact and always rejected any invitations for family meals etc. He only hinted a few times that his wife didn't like our family too much. The only time we saw his kid in person was out at a shopping mall by chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo over the past few years, my mum's health has worsened, requiring surgery and extra care. I got my folks to move in myself and my wife as it would be easier on them, along with getting professional care services in the daytime. I've always updated my brother from time to time about the situation but he has never visited in person and has only sent the odd fruit basket here and there.\n\n  \nRecently, I shared with my parents that we were looking to sell our current house to finance an upgrade to a bigger house in a better area. My dad stopped me and said there was no need to as they were able to finance that as they were selling off some properties they had (my parents were not wealthy. They were middle class folks who bought some properties while they were dirt cheap). My parents spoke abit about their plans and said that my brother would be receiving half too.  \n\n\nI honestly got pissed off and questioned their decision given his utter lack of existence in the past 20 years. My parents said that at the end of the day, he is still their son and it is only fair to do so. I said that by giving him half, I'm put at a disadvantage to him given what I had done over the past few years. I told them that I didn't care about about his half of the inheritance and asked them to consider donating his half away.   \n\n\nI found it extremely insulting to be at the end of the day, valued the same as my brother. One could say value goes beyond monetary items but I feel that action speaks louder than words. My wife chided me for being so confrontational about it, but idk man, this feels ridiculous.

Understandable feeling. \nParents can do and should do whatever they want with their $, and OP needs to realize that as parents it rarely matters what your child does, or doesn\u2019t do, we will always look out for and help and try to do right by them. \nOPs wife gets a shout out for calling husband out in his behavior! You have a good woman there! \n\nHad this been an issue of you wanting it all then without a doubt I\u2019d tell you to stfu and stop being an Ah.

Day to day needs, time off work when sick,, housesitting, helping move, etc. But at the end of the day, it is my mom's money (limited not wealthy).

You didn't make the investments and it's not up to you to decide how your parents should settle their estate. Also, frankly, it seems as if what you're actually saying is that you only maintained a relationship with your parents so they would leave you money. I'm not assuming that's true but you're making a good case for your parents to think that about you.", "It sounds like you\u2019re more interested in punishing your brother for not being around. You only care that you \u201cget more than him\u201d not how much you get. It speaks to your state of mind that you\u2019d be happier if he got nothing while you got the same amount. If it were about money, I could see asking for a 60/40 split or something, but it\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about punishing him. \n\nYour parents clearly do not feel the same resentment towards their son.

Inheritance generally should go on a 50/50 split situations like this without playing favorites based on who was closer to whom. \n\nI can't imagine how your parents must have felt hearing you essentially demand payment retroactively for being involved in their life...on top of all the free money they're already giving you.", "NTA. i get what your saying but honestly it's not your place to decide. it's nice that your worried about your parents feelings but you need to mind your business.", "YTA.

How fucking dare you spit in the face of your parents who were giving you money so you wouldn\u2019t struggle. Why would you put this stress on them!?", "NAH. That is their son and it's their money and therefore it's their right to do whatever they want to with it. Good parents never stop loving their child and wanting to take care of them. I understand why you feel the way you feel, but you're not actually entitled to the full inheritance. It has nothing to do with your \"value\". Your parents love both of their children. I'm sure they cherish their memories with you and love you for everything you have done. I understand that your brother doesn't deserve it, and I understand why that upsets you, but you can't actually get mad at your parents over this.", "YTA. It isn\u2019t your money to decide what to do with and you shouldn\u2019t do nice things just so that you come out ahead.

It's your parents' money and they can do whatever they want with it. \n\nIt sounds like you moved your parents in in the hopes of getting everything from them.

I probably would be resentful too, but regardless, it\u2019s their decision, their money and still their son sorry.
