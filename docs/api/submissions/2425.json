He had his own life when he was pretty young. He married young and our family (parents and I) barely kept in contact with him. There were no disagreements, fights etc. He didn't cut us off, but never made any attempts to keep in contact and always rejected any invitations for family meals etc. He only hinted a few times that his wife didn't like our family too much. The only time we saw his kid in person was out at a shopping mall by chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo over the past few years, my mum's health has worsened, requiring surgery and extra care. I got my folks to move in myself and my wife as it would be easier on them, along with getting professional care services in the daytime. I've always updated my brother from time to time about the situation but he has never visited in person and has only sent the odd fruit basket here and there.\n\n  \nRecently, I shared with my parents that we were looking to sell our current house to finance an upgrade to a bigger house in a better area. My dad stopped me and said there was no need to as they were able to finance that as they were selling off some properties they had (my parents were not wealthy. They were middle class folks who bought some properties while they were dirt cheap). My parents spoke abit about their plans and said that my brother would be receiving half too.  \n\n\nI honestly got pissed off and questioned their decision given his utter lack of existence in the past 20 years. My parents said that at the end of the day, he is still their son and it is only fair to do so. I said that by giving him half, I'm put at a disadvantage to him given what I had done over the past few years. I told them that I didn't care about about his half of the inheritance and asked them to consider donating his half away.   \n\n\nI found it extremely insulting to be at the end of the day, valued the same as my brother. One could say value goes beyond monetary items but I feel that action speaks louder than words. My wife chided me for being so confrontational about it, but idk man, this feels ridiculous.

NTA, while it is their money, they seem to be ignoring all your efforts and contributions. And it seems like you are more upset about that implication given how they are splitting things. Perhaps they don't realize how it is making you feel (under valued and under appreciated) or why.", "It's a parental gift, not a job.  If he's on the clock, he should've said that years ago.", "To OP, it's about him helping them a lot, the other son not wanting to see them at all, and the parents want to treat them the same. Telling OP he's done nothing to deserve any recognition. That he's the same. Nothing he did matters.\n\nIs that accurate? Hopefully nope. But expecting OP not to feel stung is unrealistic. Next up he'll probably distance himself a bit, or potentially a lot. And then the parents will be mystified why they're losing both kids.", "Yes and no.\n\nOf course looking after family this way isn't exactly a 'job'. However, if one of my sister spent a number of years looking after my parents while I didn't even talk to them, I would absolutely expect her to get a larger inheritance.\n\nFamily are the people who show up for you, who care for you.\n\nIt's up to the parents who they want to will their estate to, of course - but I would agree with OP that Brother hasn't acted like family in a long time, and it's a bit of a slap in the face to someone who *has* to be told they are 'equally worthy of being considered family' (which is cleraly how OP is interpreting this).", "He can be pissed if he wants, but it\u2019s vindictive to argue that the brother should get nothing and have his half donated. He doesn\u2019t even care if he gets more, so long as the brother gets less. That\u2019s not about being treated equally, it\u2019s about punishing the brother. That makes him an asshole."]}
