He\u2019s a genuine guy, lots of fun, and has brought a great group of friends together over the years who all support each other, adventure together, and feel like family. \n\nWe love him, but a few of us have noticed that he\u2019s consistently a jerk to his pregnant wife and it\u2019s getting hard to watch. She works full time just like him but handles absolutely everything at home with their toddler and seems totally exhausted and miserable.\n\nA few nights ago, I was at their house for a bit before he and I went to grab a beer. When he got home (from another friends house, not from work), his wife wanted to give their kid the iPad so she could visit with us. He said no that this was his only chance to see him that day and he didn\u2019t want his kid\u2019s nose in a screen. But then he basically ignored them completely until we left, leaving her to keep the kid occupied. His wife asked him to put kiddo to bed before we left (she\u2019d been with him alone all day), and he flat out refused, acted like she was rude for even asking him and said that he \u201chad a friend here.\u201d She looked so hurt and just quietly took their son into his bedroom while my friend grabbed his coat and happily asked me \u201cready to go?\u201d\n\nI told him he should put his son to bed and I\u2019d wait. He looked at me like \u201cdude.\u201d Like I wasn\u2019t helping him get out of it.\n\nI\u2019m not one to invade privacy or get involved in friend\u2019s family lives, but it seems like he\u2019s genuinely unaware of what an AH he\u2019s being and I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s doing real damage to his marriage and doesn\u2019t see it.\n\nWould I be the AH to confront him about it?", "created_utc": 1700428838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17z7ang/aitah_for_wanting_to_tell_my_friend_hes_a_jerk_to/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're friends and friends call each other out on their crap. And clearly the rest of your friends also wanna say something as well. Dude is acting like he's 21 with no kids instead of a married man with a toddler and a child on the way. It's nice of you guys to wanna stand up for her because she's clearly struggling and tired. I would tell him \"I'm your friend and I'm not trying to criticize you and tear you down but your wife is pregnant and needs help. They're your children too and you should be helping her. She's exhausted and she's pregnant. Being in a marriage means y'all are a team and you should be splitting the housework and child care evenly.\" That's the nice way of saying it. You could go my route as well and say it bluntly too lol", "NTA. Real friends call each other out on their crap. And i agree, your friend needs to know that he's doing damage to his marriage. I'd straight up start by asking, \" Why do you treat your wife like that?\"\" And see what he says. It could be he's fully aware but doesnt care about his wife and divorce. But if you're not close to this friend, be prepared that he may take offense and stop contact.", "Your friend is not a genuine or supportive person if that\u2019s how he treats his wife. He\u2019s literally being two faced. Why would you even want to be friends with him? However he treats you is a front if that\u2019s how he acts towards the people closest to\nhim-his wife and kid. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, makes you wonder how does he treat her when no one is around. Are you sure it wouldn\u2019t have an impact on her if you speak out? Will he make her life more difficult if you do? Do you have absolutely no concerns for her well-being with him or might you be better off asking her how she would feel if you brought it up with him? Just a thought, and something to consider before you do speak to him.", "NTA. I would confront him about it, and if he's not open to hearing it and doesn't change that person wouldn't remain my friend. You said at the beginning he's a good guy, but good guys don't treat their wives like that. Maybe he just needs a wakeup call, and sadly some men won't listen till another man confronts them about it.", "NTA. It's important to communicate with our friends, especially when their actions may be causing harm to their loved ones. Confronting your friend about his behavior could potentially open his eyes to the impact he's having on his wife and their relationship.", "NTA.\n\nIf he\u2019s happy to treat his wife like this in front of other people, how does he treat her behind closed doors? \n\nMaybe hearing what an asshole he is from one of his friends is the wake up call he needs.", "NTA but tread lightly if this discussion goes bad, it's probably the end of your friendship.", "NTA. If you notice it, please speak up for the slim chance it may cause him to respect in his actions a bit but also so his wife hears that others notice this and it isn't okay.", "Thanks, everyone. These responses are helpful. Interestingly, I didn\u2019t ID my gender in the OP, but I am a woman with a male best friend. I\u2019m queer and feel like I have an individual friendship with both him and his wife, so yeah, I could speak to either of them.", "NTA\n\nYour instincts to speak up are good; he needs to hear more from people like you.\n\nI want to suggest you tread carefully to gauge how he handles your feedback/questions. His treatment of her could be about what you saw; it could be even darker than that.\n\nIt's nice for his wife if she gets to hear someone stand up for her. Is your wife or someone else in the friend group close enough to his wife to be able to reach out to her - find out how she is doing/what help she may need?\n\nThank you for speaking up and helping someone in need.", "NTA do you know when feminists say men get away with treating women like shit because Other men let them and look the other way? Well this is what's happening here. This is your moment to not be one of those men who let their friends be shit people. Talk to him. And if you can, tell the wife she has a place she needs to go to if she needs to leave. If he talks to her like crap and treats her like crap in front of other poeple, chances are he's worse in private too.", "Hot dang NTA but tread lightly. \n\nThis sounds like his values are more in line with the 1950\u2019s . If his whole belief system is that patriarchal he\u2019s got to see a problem with that first. And if his wife isn\u2019t setting boundaries and setting expectations he\u2019s not likely going to voluntarily make his life harder. \n\n\nAnd if he tells you to get bent\u2026 potentially the one person who sees the issue will be gone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
