Long story short things got heated and my parents suggested I move out of my grandparents back home because of the toxic environment that was being produced in their home. \n\nI had to move into a room with my brother which I didn\u2019t mind because my parents said it would be temporary and if I kept my space clean I could move into the other room when my oldest sisters kids moved in with her( another story for another time). Now the kids have been gone for 6 months  and their reasoning is that I keep my side of the room unorganized and therefore do not need my own room or space\n\nFor context I\u2019m 23, a full time nursing student with a part time job as well. I Can admit things do get messy sometimes especially when I have tests or work overtime to get more money. But I always clean up \n\nMy brother is 20. I love him with all my heart but he\u2019s the epitome of a spiraling middle child. He\u2019s either quit or gotten fired from every job. Flunked out of college multiple semesters. And basically smokes and plays video games all day. He\u2019s also mean and nasty to everyone in the house and also refuses to do any chores which are also left for me to do on top of my already busy schedule. \n\nNo matter how much I reorganize my room his side always looks like a tornado hit it with dirty weed smelling clothes everywhere. I\u2019ve even come home to his things all over my bed. My mom has never really made him do anything or expected him to do anything. She still won\u2019t move me out of the room. My scrubs and school uniforms even smell like weed sometimes because of my brother. \n\nI know this seems minor but accelerated nursing programs are HIGHLY stressful and I have nowhere to do my work and I\u2019m constantly fighting with my brother for simple things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that I\u2019m working so hard and he\u2019s doing nothing and we both get the same treatment. I decided I can\u2019t take it anymore and while things are sometimes tense with my grandparents they said I\u2019m welcome to come back and I would have my own space and a desk and be closer to school as well.
