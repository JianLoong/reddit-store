My family are excited about I decided to do a small gender reveal over the Easter weekend. I had this planned for Saturday, so a few days before, I asked a small local business if she could please make 12 cupcakes with pink and blue icing on top, and pink icing in the middle. She agreed and said they would be ready to collect Friday evening\n\nthe plan was to pick the cakes up friday, invite friends and family over saturday and give some guests a cupcake which would reveal the gender. i only invited a few guests as my apartment is fairly small, and i didnt want to do a large gender reveal anyway, just something cute and fun, plus, everyone loves cupcakes \n\nSo friday evening came, the small business owner (Claire) gave me her address to collect the cakes from, said they would cost \u00a325 and they are ready to collect whenever. i drove to her apartment and knocked on the door. she greeted me there with the box of cupcakes and they looked amazing. they were exactly how i imagined them and thanked her for them. she gave me the box, but just as she did, her large pet dog came running up to me, barking, and jumped at me, knocking the box of cupcakes all over the floor\n\nClaire apologised and shut the dog inside he was still barking and jumping at the door. She said it\u2019s because he gets excited when people come and visit, but he wouldn\u2019t have hurt me as he\u2019s friendly. At this point i didn\u2019t know the damage to the cupcakes as the box landed upside down, i picked it up and the cakes were ruined. the icing had smashed all over the box and some cakes had spilled out onto the ground\n\nClaire looked horrified as i understand she spent a few hours making them for me, she apologised and said she could remake them for free, but they wouldn\u2019t be ready until Sunday. I said unfortunately im expecting my guests tomorrow and sunday is no good, as i already had other plans. i explained i wouldn\u2019t be paying for these cupcakes as they were inedible and ruined by her dog. We agreed payment upon receiving the goods, and since i never received them, i wouldn\u2019t be paying\n\nShe said that I should still pay as she had to buy ingredients for the cakes and the costs of eggs has gone up meaning she would be out of pocket. i said if she had control of her dog, then they wouldn\u2019t of been dropped and im sorry but again, i wouldnt be paying\n\ni got in my car and left without the cupcakes. i still had guests attend on saturday, i announced the gender in person, rather than with some cupcakes but it was still nice spending time with my friends and family. my family were all happy, but my sister in law said i should of still paid for the cupcakes as she accepted it was her fault, and offered to remake them for me\n\ni personally don\u2019t think i should of had to pay for them, but now im feeling slightly guilty as i understand it\u2019s a small business and a loss of profit would affect her a lot harder than a larger business\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681222159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12il0pe/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_gender_reveal/", "score": 2167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to act like a professional. Having a wild, uncontrollable dog jumping all over your customers and knocking your product out of their hands as they're trying to pick it up is not acting like a professional. This has nothing to do with the cost of eggs. She knows her dog doesn't behave and therefore should crate it or lock it in another room when she is meeting customers.\n\nNo way should you pay a dime for those cupcakes you couldn't use. If she could have remade them for you that day and delivered them to your house, sure. But you had no use for them a week later. Her fault so she eats the cost.", "NTA - she should be a responsible dog owner and have her dog kept elsewhere when guests are coming - especially since she openly admitted that he \"gets excited\" like that with new people.", "NTA. She should have put the dog away knowing he \u201cgets excited\u201d when people visit. Small business or not it\u2019s just common sense.", "NTA why on earth would you need to pay for something you didn\u2019t receive? I know it would be nice to help out Claire a little bit if you guys were friends but if this is just some lady then no", "NTA Next time, she'll learn to lock him in a back room when she's making a sale. \"Don't worry, he's friendly\" needs to stop being an excuse. There's absolutely no reason for you to have paid for cupcakes you didn't receive, and which were ruined by her dog.", "NTA you didn't get what you paid for.\n\nAlso, I'm a massive dog lover but wouldn't be happy paying for professional baking if I thought a dog was hanging around the kitchen.", "NTA. Her dog ruined the cupcakes she made for you. That's sad for her, because it means she can't get paid for them. You don't need to pay her for cupcakes you didn't receive because her dog destroyed them.", "NTA\n\nIt's a shame and it sucks for her, but she should be locking her dog up when handing over delicate goods to customers, especially since she admitted she knows he gets excited when people visit! Hopefully she learns the lesson for the future.", "NTA\n\nYou did not receive the agreed upon goods due to no fault of yours. You didn\u2019t even get that upset it seems. Just like a \u201coh man. This sucks for both of us. Neither one of us gets what we want out of this transaction.\u201d vibe. \n\nAlso, not having her dog secured while conduct business is bad enough, but while conducting business concerning the production of food\u2026 that\u2019s bad.", "NTA. If she knows her dog gets excited she should\u2019ve put it away.", "NTA you didn\u2019t get the goods that you wanted, due to her. If my large, excitable dogs destroyed someone\u2019s property I would pay for it, this is no different. It\u2019s unfortunate for the both of you, but this is why obedience training is so important, especially if someone is operating a business out of their home.", "She\u2019s out of pocket and lost the cost of ingredients BECAUSE HER DOG RUINED THEM. Her offer to remake them for the day after your event is not a solution that works for you and was not what you agreed to. NTA.", "NTA - Despite making the cupcakes, she failed to deliver the cupcakes.\n\nShe needs to take this as a lesson to better control her dog.", "NTA. Clare needs to keep the dog & the cupcakes seperate.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for cupcakes and got nothing. It's her dog's fault so she eats the cost.", "NTA\n\nSorry that happened! And I feel a little bad for her too, but maybe this will be a good lesson to put the dog away when customers are coming by", "NTA. I\u2019m honestly quite shocked that she would ask you to pay for cupcakes that her dog clearly ruined when you declined her offer of the second batch. If she had made you the second batch for Sunday, would she have charged you twice? Reviews are important for small business owners, she should have her dog put away when customers come over and her failure to do so means she was unable to do her job properly.", "NTA, you agreed for them by a certain time and it was her fault they weren't available. If anything I'd say she's an asshole for trying to still get you to pay.", "NTA because it was her dog. She is the owner so it's her responsibility to keep the dog under control.", "NTA and people asking you to pay are entitled looney birds. Just saying. Some people are deathly afraid of dogs, for that reason alone it should've been locked up while doing business. Or the baker should've placed the box in the client's vehicle.", "NTA. She should have been watching the dog. If you had dropped them without interference from the dog, that would be a different story.", "NTA. \nI bake and believe this was just plain unprofessional. \nI would have offered to redecorate them on the spot and delivered them to you to ensure they didn\u2019t get damaged again. This was her fault for having her dog out. \n\nNever in the history of baking from home have I allowed my pets to be present when I\u2019m in the process of making desserts or handing them over. \n1 it\u2019s unsanitary, and 2 my customers didn\u2019t come to pick up with the expectation of my dogs greeting them or barking at them. Many people do not like dogs, the last thing you want is to make your customer feel unsafe.", "NTA. She should have put her dog away when expecting a customer over for pick up of goods. It honestly annoys me so much when people get large excitable dogs, but have no idea how to control or curb the behaviour. This was entirely on her, and I hope the personal expense out of pocket will serve as a lesson to her if she wants her business to thrive.", "NTA at all. I\u2019m shocked she even asked for payment after that.", "NTA at all. It's her fault the cupcakes were ruined, so she had to just eat the cost.", "NTA. As the owner of an excitable dog, she should know to take precautions. Honestly, this could have been worse. What if the dog had knocked YOU over or you were terribly afraid of dogs?", "NTA Absolutely do not pay for them. She should have had better control of the dog but because she didn't she allowed him to ruin the cupcakes. They're hers now so is the cost of making them ingredients and all. I'm sorry your gender reveal was ruined. However congratulations.", "NTA-Even if you paid beforehand, a damaged product would warrant a refund. You were right in not paying, especially for a product you can not use. I would have done the same, small business or not you need to be professional and having their dog loose while a customer is there to retrieve their product is a no. It was nice of her to suggest remaking the batch for free but you were on a time schedule and they just wouldn\u2019t be ready when you needed. But it\u2019s gone and passed and hopefully in the future she will put her dog up as to not ruin business.", "NTA. The attempted guilt trip makes no sense. She insists that you pay for the ruined cupcakes or else she'll be out of pocket. She also offers to make another batch for free, which would mean she's out the same amount as she would lose by you not paying for the first batch.\n\nHer dog. Her fault. Her loss.", "NTA. I have 4 dogs, 2 large, and I always step outside when receiving items so I don't have to worry about them causing an issue. She should have closed the door or put the dog up, knowing it gets excited and jumps on people. It's poor etiquette to let a dog jump on someone no matter what the situation is. Especially when food is involved, you shouldn't have animals around. That's why they aren't allowed in restaurants and food stores unless they are service dogs who are trained.", "NTA. You didn't receive the product so no money was transferred. It's unreasonable to expect you to pay just because she made a mistake, thats the risk with any business.", "NTA. This whole situation was the seller\u2019s fault, so she should eat the cost. You shouldn\u2019t pay for anything because you didn\u2019t get anything.", "No you are NTA.\n\nHer dog's behaviour caused the accident, and if she knows it's an excitable dog she should have restrained him ahead of time.\n\nIt sucks that she's lost the payment but as a business owner she should have insurance against accidents but also most sensible business owners build in the cost of damage or spoilage or other reasons for not being able to sell their products into their financial model.", "NTA. It\u2019s Claire\u2019s responsibility to get control of her dogs, especially she know her dog had this issue. Frankly I don\u2019t think they\u2019re entitled to any payment at all.", "NTA. I once sent the wrong coin to someone who purchased from me. What did I do about my mistake? I apologized and immediately sent the correct coin. I also sent a full refund for the correct coin as soon as I got the mistake back in hand. Buyer was blown away, but I insisted. My small business, my mistake, I should be the one to eat it lol.", "NTA. Everyone is making some good points. I'm also confused about why she couldn't make you replacement cupcakes in time? I bake all the time, and 12 cupcakes isn't really that time consuming. Even if I had to go back to the store and get more ingredients, or miss a few hours of sleep, if my dog had destroyed someone's cupcakes, I would have at least replaced them by Saturday morning.", "NTA and given that she offered to remake them for free, she knew she was at fault. Remaking them would have required more time and money spent on ingredients, so I really don't see how it makes a difference.", "NTA \n\nAs a business owner that is something you accept as coming out of your own pocket rather than the customers. Next time she should have the dog locked in the bedroom for pick up.", "NTA. Dog owners should know how to control their dogs specially if they know that they are easily excitable or keep them away from strangers who may not know that the said dog is excitable. End of.", "NTA. The baker\u2019s dog ruined the cupcakes so she is at fault here. If she knows he gets excited when there are visitors and even jumps on people she should have put him in another room before answering the door.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t get cupcakes. You didn\u2019t even get replacement cupcakes. Even if you paid in advance, then got the cupcakes but were ruined by the dog, good business practice is refund the money and remake them for free. Plus her dog should\u2019ve been in a different room or she should\u2019ve came outside to meet you. This was avoidable and she didn\u2019t take precaution.", "NTA. She did not secure her known-to-be-overly-friendly-with-strangers dog and is entirely responsible for the cakes being ruined, so she is not providing you with the goods and services she has agreed upon in your engagement, therefore you are not obligated to uphold your side of the engagement - payment - either. It is the exact same situation as of they had dropped off her kitchen counter - she cannot expect you to pay for them for something that is her fault. It is a loss she has to take.", "Nta if she knows her dog gets excited then she can open the door a little bit say hey I got to put my dog away real quick", "NTA they were only on the floor because of her dog.", "NTA\nThe product was ruined due to her failure to keep her dog under control.", "NTA you would have been expected to check and make sure the order was correct before you paid for them, the dog ruined them before you paid for them, it\u2019s not your fault that she failed to control her dog", "NTA - through literally only her own negligence, the cupcakes were ruined. You did nothing at all that caused this. It sucks but if you run a business without accounting for breakage (ie any unplanned loss of materials, product, or income) then you\u2019re not running a very good business. This is breakage, and she needs to eat the loss.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks....but she owns the dog and she knows the dog\n\nIf the dog is crazy around strangers, the dog should have been put up when the doorbell rang", "NTA.\n\nShe knew her dog would be excited and should have taken the proper precautions to ensure the dog was in a room and unable to jump at clients.\n\nThe dog ruined them. If it were a professional bakery the price would have been comped. Her business is no different.\n\nThis is on her, not you.\n\nYou do not have to pay for product that was ruined when recieing.", "NTA. My husband has owned several businesses, some of them small, and this is clear-cut the fault of the business owner. The business owner created an environment that put her product at risk (an excited dog plus transaction exchange at her residence which houses the excited dog) and her lack of preparation (not making sure the dog was restrained or in another room when a new customer comes over) is 100% at fault for this. Sucks that she is out money but her lack of preparation doesn't translate into a liability or obligation on your part. You didn't get the product, you don't pay for any part of it, period. Don't feel bad at ALL. This is a good learning moment for her and I hope she takes it and corrects things going forward.", "NTA\n\nShe knows, that her dog gets excited and should have taken that into account.  \nIt's not your fault, that the cupcakes were damaged, simple as that.", " NTA. She knew her dog was a problem and should have dealt with it before opening the door", "NTA\n\nShe learned the hard way not to let dogs crowd the front door.", "NTA at all! \n\nClaire knows how excited her dog can get.  She should\u2019ve taken measures to make sure there was no contact when you went to pick up the cupcakes.", "NTA. Dog people need to understand that their pet \"just getting excited sometimes\" can have actual consequences.", "NTA! They got ruined by HER dog!!!! In HER apartment. Let this be a lesson to her that she needs to keep her Dog locked up when customers are arriving. It was unprofessional of her to do that. Btw, I really hate it when dog owners claim \u201che\u2019s just so friendly\u201d when the dog is clearly invading one person space and in their face. I don\u2019t give a hoot how \u201cfriendly\u201d you think your Dog is, did you ever stop to consider that maybe your fellow human doesn\u2019t want the k9 that close?", "NTA. It was her dog that destroyed the cupcakes.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t receive the product because her own (poorly trained) dog ruined them.", "NTA and in my area at least you can\u2019t get your kitchen certified to legally sell food items if you have a pet in your home. That aside it is her job as a pet owner who knows that her dog gets excited to keep control of her animal, if that means keeping them kennels so be it. Her negligence is what cost her money not you.", "NTA - the baker has some nerve trying to charge you for the cupcakes after her dog ruined them", "NTA.  Her dog ruined the cupcakes, so she is responsible for costs, not you.  If you had dropped them etc, different story.", "NTA. If she knew her dog gets excited when people come, logical action would be to lock it away... it's common sense.", "NTA,\n\nA dog being friendly is not the same as being trained. It doesn't matter if he is friendly or not, jumping on strangers isn't friendly at all.  \nShe has a good lesson now to keep the dog away from potentiel clients if she can't control the dog.  \n\n\nit also doesn't help her business if she has her dog being like that and she wants to work in the food industry, it screams unprofessional IMHO.", "NTA. if she can\u2019t control her dog she shouldn\u2019t have people pick things up from her home\u2026", "NTA\n\nHer dog ruined the transaction before it was complete, and you did not take the cupcakes.", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks, but she was unable to deliver the product as specified, when specified...  Why should you have paid?  Hopefully this is a lesson for her about keeping pets away from business interactions... It could have cost her a lot more if it was a bigger order.", "Nta\n\nPaying for her petneglect? The nerve.", "NTA.  She needs to keep the dog out of the bakery area so accidents won't happen again.  It's a shame, but you paid for a product but did not get the product.", "NTA - The vendor destroyed the product, you have no responsibility to pay her for anything.", "NTA - Feel really sorry for the cake maker but she has learned a valuable lesson with her dog as could have been a far bigger cake", "NTA. She didn't control her dog and it damaged her product. You shouldn't have to pay for her negligence.", "NTA and congratulations. The lady should have anticipated behaviour of her ill trained dog, and dealt with you and the cake elsewhere.", "Tell SIL where to send the money\n\nNTA", "NTA. /Her/ dog ruined them. It'd be different if you tripped down the stairs yourself or something, then it'd be on you. But /her/ dog jumped and knocked them down. She should have put the dog up, we have to.\n\nHer fault, she eats the cost. You didn't get the cupcakes for the event you commissioned them for.\n\nCongrats on the baby!", "Nta\n\nThe cupcakes were ruined by her dog, as the dogs owner, that makes it her responsibility to make you whole. The options would either be a refund or remaking them, a remake would be too late, so that leaves refund.", "NTA. You were there to pay for complete, ready cupcakes. You were delivered smashed cupcakes. It's a  \u00a325 lesson for her. Put the dog up before inviting people in.", "NTA Claire should have offered to remake them for free for when you needed them or accept she wasn\u2019t going to get paid as she should have controlled her dog better/she was responsible for the damaged goods", "NTA at all, you are completely right", "NTA. Would you expect to still have to pay for a beer if the bartender spilled the entire thing on the ground before passing it to you?", "NTA. Her dog. Her apartment. Her fault.", "NTA. She tried to guilt you for her error in not restraining her animal. None of which is your fault or responsibility.", "No. The destruction was her fault, and she couldn't replace them in time for the event.", "NTA just like you said you technically didn\u2019t receive the product.", "NTA \n\n\nShe would have been out of pocket if she had to remake them all anyway. You didn't receive the goods, and if she knew her animal was excitable, it should have been put away. She was unprofessional.", "NTA. It's actually really boils down to the major flaw in the thing your SIL said\n\n>my sister in law said i should of still paid for the cupcakes as she accepted it was her fault, and offered to remake them for me\n\nShe offered to remake the cupcakes for free which means she was willing to rebuy and spend the extra time to fix you up a new order- all unpaid. There is literally no logic in being upset. Instead of not paying for a whole new service, you're just not paying for the original service and not subjecting her to the labor and cost of an additional one. \n\n>She said that I should still pay as she had to buy ingredients for the cakes and the costs of eggs has gone up meaning she would be out of pocket.\n\nSame logic can be applied to what she said. If she was willing to buy it all again for free, then there is literally no difference in not paying.", "NTA. I own a small side business myself (not an MLM but a food pop up FWIW). I can't stand the attitude that a small business can do no wrong simply because they aren't a commercial chain or big box and \"need our support.\" If you suck at your business, I have no problem Yelping that. I don't care if you're running it out of your garage. YOU NEED TO STEP UP YOUR GAME. Period.\n\nMom and pop businesses aren't infallible and quality of goods and services should still count for something.", "NTA - If her dog had knocked the cupcakes over before you got there, the result would have been the same and she wouldn't have asked you for ingredients.  \n\nIt was totally her fault, and maybe she will consider this the next time she has people pick up their orders at her home and make sure her dog is crated or shut in a room during the handoff.", "If you were in a store and about to pay but this happened- would you still pay? I wouldn\u2019t.", "You're a nicer person than me for even considering that you might be the asshole here.", "NTA they were ruined by her dog and remaking them to not have them available by the event day is pointless. She has some nerve still expecting payment.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re a kid at an ice cream shop who walked outside and promptly dropped the cone, the whole scenario was entirely of her making and under her control to ensure it did not happen. \n\nI\u2019m a hobby baker and I\u2019m well aware that it\u2019s a big cost to make cakes and similar, but this is just silly on her behalf. \n\nI\u2019m also a dog owner and cake/business aside, being all \u201coh he\u2019s just friendly\u201d is *not* good practice. Same flavour of person who lets their dog off lead at the park and then cheerfully shouts from too far away to do anything that their dog is friendly - cool for them, what if the other dog is not?", "NTA. And honestly with a dog running rampant in the home I wouldn't have ordered from her at all.\n\nI'm not against pets, I'm not against home businesses but when food is concerned they should be VERY well separated.", "Imagine you order a cake from a professional bakery.  As they are handing you the cake, their fellow employee bumps it and it falls to the ground.

If the woman is charging people for her cupcakes, she needs to be professional about it.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not only did the dog she's responsible for ruin the product she had baked, but it also \\* jumped up on a pregnant lady \\*. She needs to train that dog yesterday. She's lucky the only casualties in this scenario were a few cupcakes and a few eggs out-of-pocket.", "NTA, only massive corporations get away with ripping people off the way she was trying to do to you. I mean accidents happen but expecting you to pay for it was just icing on the cake", "Nta, obviously.  Terrible idea to have someone pick them up from your house if you have any pets.", "NTA. Her excuse that she would be out of pocket for ingredients doesn't hold water if she offered to make another set for free. Was she just not going to use eggs in that batch?", "I don\u2019t tend to think it\u2019s great to buy from home bakers if they have animals anyways. You never know how clean they really are. And as someone with pets I know how much fur floats around spaces too. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey were ruined due to her negligence.  Not yours.  You shouldn't have to pay for them.", "From the title and the beginning, I was prepared to vote another way, thinking you ordered the cupcakes and expected someone else to pay or them to be free, but you\u2019re totally in the clear here. Accidents happen, she can write it off as a business expense but you paying full price for those ruined cupcakes (ruined by the small business owners carelessness about their dog, knowing the pup likes to greet and jump on people), that\u2019s just ludicrous. She should not make a profit on her mistake if they were ruined, and as they were gender reveal cupcakes, I\u2019m sure any messing up of the icing and such would ruin the reveal. Hard NTA.", "NTA: It was her dog that caused it. If for whatever reason you brought a dog in, then you should pay but that wasn\u2019t the case.", "NTA -and honestly she should have put her large untrained dog behind a closed door before a pregnant woman came over anyways. Claire is lucky he knocked the cupcakes down and not you.", "Hmm, yeah if someone handed me my order, then spiked it into the ground I wouldn't pay them. Don't see why their dog friend would be any different. NTA", "Absolutely NTA. If she can\u2019t control her pets then she shouldn\u2019t be running a business out of her pets home. It\u2019s ridiculous she even asked for payment tbh.", "NTA. She knows how her dog is, she could've put the dog up before answering the door.", "NTA I have a small dog who also (we are working on it) likes to jump on people when they come in. I would hate for someone to trip and fall bc of the little goober. So if I know people are coming over w their hands full, I put him in a crate or I hold him. \n\nShe should have considered this.", "NTA", "NTA cake maker should've put her dog outside until you had left with the cakes you ordered, not a box of mess!.. If you had dropped them outside then sure that's on you, if  order a Pizza and as they hand it to me, it falls on the floor,  you're damn sure that I'm not paying for it! Or a staff member knocks it out my hand!..", "NTA -- Her dog, her inability to control the dog that crashed into you while you were still on her property. \n\nHer offering to remake them doesn't matter -- it was a party item and too late. Also, she would have been out of the ingredients cost either way, if she remade them. \n\nIf you feel like being super-generous and smoothing this over, you could pay her half the cost of the smashed cupcakes. But you don't owe her anything.", "no, you are not the asshole. \n\nif a person is going to run a business, then it needs to be professional. even if it's a side, home business. \n\nthe dog was just being a dog. no big deal. the owner should've locked him up before opening the door. this is completely on her, not you. don't feel guilty.", "Nta, the business owner is out some money but has also learned a valuable lesson about doing business at home.", "NTA. \n\nI can see an argument to pay. You did receive them. But then again, the person who destroyed them could then be sued for their value. Since that\u2019s the same person you\u2019d be paying, she\u2019d just needs to hand the money back to you. \n\nNot a fun or comfortable situation for either of you but she needs to be responsible for her dog\u2019s behavior. Dogs behavior is owner\u2019s responsibility.", "Absolutely NTA. She'll learn to have her dog secured in the future. (Truthfully the loose dog brings about other concerns but that is for another sub \ud83d\ude43)", "NTA. Honestly the baker is very fortunate that her dog only ruined a small order.

My family are excited about I decided to do a small gender reveal over the Easter weekend. I had this planned for Saturday, so a few days before, I asked a small local business if she could please make 12 cupcakes with pink and blue icing on top, and pink icing in the middle. She agreed and said they would be ready to collect Friday evening\n\nthe plan was to pick the cakes up friday, invite friends and family over saturday and give some guests a cupcake which would reveal the gender. i only invited a few guests as my apartment is fairly small, and i didnt want to do a large gender reveal anyway, just something cute and fun, plus, everyone loves cupcakes \n\nSo friday evening came, the small business owner (Claire) gave me her address to collect the cakes from, said they would cost \u00a325 and they are ready to collect whenever. i drove to her apartment and knocked on the door. she greeted me there with the box of cupcakes and they looked amazing. they were exactly how i imagined them and thanked her for them. she gave me the box, but just as she did, her large pet dog came running up to me, barking, and jumped at me, knocking the box of cupcakes all over the floor\n\nClaire apologised and shut the dog inside he was still barking and jumping at the door. She said it\u2019s because he gets excited when people come and visit, but he wouldn\u2019t have hurt me as he\u2019s friendly. At this point i didn\u2019t know the damage to the cupcakes as the box landed upside down, i picked it up and the cakes were ruined. the icing had smashed all over the box and some cakes had spilled out onto the ground\n\nClaire looked horrified as i understand she spent a few hours making them for me, she apologised and said she could remake them for free, but they wouldn\u2019t be ready until Sunday. I said unfortunately im expecting my guests tomorrow and sunday is no good, as i already had other plans. i explained i wouldn\u2019t be paying for these cupcakes as they were inedible and ruined by her dog. We agreed payment upon receiving the goods, and since i never received them, i wouldn\u2019t be paying\n\nShe said that I should still pay as she had to buy ingredients for the cakes and the costs of eggs has gone up meaning she would be out of pocket. i said if she had control of her dog, then they wouldn\u2019t of been dropped and im sorry but again, i wouldnt be paying\n\ni got in my car and left without the cupcakes. i still had guests attend on saturday, i announced the gender in person, rather than with some cupcakes but it was still nice spending time with my friends and family. my family were all happy, but my sister in law said i should of still paid for the cupcakes as she accepted it was her fault, and offered to remake them for me\n\ni personally don\u2019t think i should of had to pay for them, but now im feeling slightly guilty as i understand it\u2019s a small business and a loss of profit would affect her a lot harder than a larger business\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
