{"id": 33994, "submission_id": "18txvnu", "title": "AITA for throwing an obese friend's unsolicited weight loss advice back at him because he kept pestering my wife about her weight?", "selftext": "**ETA** _Because some people are making assumptions  here saying I try to control my wife and she needs my permission to do everything. No. I do not tell her what to and not to do. She can do whatever she wants without asking me first. She's been really hard on herself these days not eating her favourite meals or eating very little which is why I told her to loosen up a bit and eat whatever she wanted that day. If she had choosen to still not eat too much that day, it's up to her._\n\n**ETA 2** _Our son is 7 months old now and the doctor said my wife is allowed to start working out to lose some weight. Sorry for not being precise. I guess it's because English is not my first language. When we say someone just gave birth it could mean yesterday or even last year._\n\nThrowaway because I don't want this on my main account. My wife just gave birth to our son. The pregnancy was difficult and her weight fluctuated a lot. She's been trying to lose some weight and is on a very strict diet. It's not easy for her and a very sensitive issue to talk about. I'm very supportive of her and we always go running together every morning\n\nYesterday we were over at my cousin's for lunch. And I told my wife she could eat everything she wanted for the day as a reward for having worked out so hard these past few weeks. It's okay to have a cheat day once in a while. A friend 'Tommy', who himself is obese, started asking my wife questions about her weight.\n\nHe went \"I thought you're on a diet?\" She explained to him that today's her cheat day and tried to change the subject but he kept pestering her. He went on and started lecturing her on how she needs to be more discipline if she wants to lose weight. I tried to tell him to stop but he kept going, telling her what to and not to eat, just like his wife, who has now lost a lot of weight after giving birth to their third son and looks beautiful as ever.\n\nI could see my wife's face had turned red and she excused herself to the bathroom. After she left, Tommy kept giving his unsolicited advice to me on how I should keep reminding her to take care of herself etc which really upset me. At one point he said \"She needs to start eating less if she wants to reach her weight goal.\"\n\nI lost it and snapped \"Well, can you?\", looking him up and down. He looked stunned but went silence for the rest of the day. My cousin said I was being too harsh because Tommy just wanted to help and 'share' his wife's weight loss journey with us. Others told me I was fat-shaming Tommy.

But even w/o them it's obvious he was sticking up for his wife and THAT almost made me cry because it really sucks to be bullied about your weight. Weight is an extremely loaded issue because it's affected by some many factors and absolutely no one but those who live in the same house (and often not even them) know the details of the weight-loss journey. No one should EVER give unsolicited weight-loss advice. \"Tommy\" is a vicious, entitled AH who needed to be put in his place. As others have said, there's far too many men out there who give unsolicited advice/make unwanted comments about women's \"attractiveness\" and how the man thinks the woman should improve, when the woman is already ranking substantially higher on the \"attractiveness scale\" than the guy. Honestly, when it comes to other people's weight, just STFU!", "INFO When did she give birth and is she breastfeeding?", "NTA - for defending your wife. Tommy was out of line. \n\nI will say though I am a little irked by you giving your wife permission to eat whatever she wants. Kind of seems like she has a lot of people telling her what she can and cant do", "NTA if you are not pushing your wife to diet and exercise.  But her diet sounds unhealthy and possibly verging into eating disorder,  especially right after having a baby.  And you are enabling it. \n Advise her to consult her doctor.  She isn't doing this in a sustainable way.", "ESH  except your wife.  Food is necesaary an not a reward for you to allow.  You and Tommy are both assholes.  Your cousin didn't tell you both to STFU so your cousin sucks too.", "NTA. Unsolicited advice is rarely appreciated.", "NTA. Your wife has just carried a baby for 9 months, she\u2019s allowed a cheat day. You were right to say something as your friend wasn\u2019t helping, he was being vile.", "NTA & verdict confirmed re your edits.\n\nTommy had no right whatsoever to comment on your wife's weight or her diet.\n\nGood on you for shutting that down.", "NTA for what you said to your friend, but more conceringly...\n\nINFO: How long ago did your wife have the baby? Is she currently breastfeeding? Is her interest in losing the weight being managed and discussed with her doctors or possibly a nutritionist?\n\nBecause these are all extremely important factors. Most women do absolutely gain weight during pregnancy, but a large volume of that outside of the baby and the sac and placenta is things like new tissue in the milk ducts and extra blood. It can take months for the excess blood to eventually lower, and the new breast tissue weight will never go away technically (as in the new development of that area, even though the size will reduce).\n\nAnd additionally - if she's within twelve months of giving birth AND breastfeeding, her calorie requirements are actually higher than at any point during her pregnancy. Women typically need up to 400 additional calories from their normal diet by the end of pregnancy..when breastfeeding it can be upwards of 800-1000 extra calories on top of a normal diet. And eating less/being on a diet during that time will mean depletion of her actual body requirements and risk potential nourishment issues for the baby.\n\nSo this needs WAY more information as to your wife's situation - because you both may need to worry less about her weight at the moment than it seems she is doing so or your encouragement (though it doesn't seem like you're super encouraging it which is good).", "No judgement here, just some concern over a person who recently gave birth being on a strict diet, running every morning and being so concerned/worried about her weight.

I would say it was after babies first birthday my waist finally made an appearance. Sometimes its not so much about the weight as it is the shape.\n\nThat was stupid, rude man. You rightly stood up for your wife. \n\nHowever, you and your wife need to stop focussing on her weight.
