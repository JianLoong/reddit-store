I plan events for a living and the wedding is in a year and a half. When my friend, Dee, and her fianc\u00e9, Ray, asked me to coordinate, I set up a dinner with the bride, groom and their parents. Dee, Ray and I had been discussing the potential budget for what they had envisioned. Dee\u2019s parents are putting up 1/3 of the money and Dee and Ray are putting up another 1/3. Rays mother said she couldn\u2019t afford to help with the wedding and Dee\u2019s father assured everyone that his father (Dee\u2019s grandfather) stated he wanted to help with whatever other expenses were needed. I informed everyone that my job was the please the bride and groom and I would not under any circumstances go against their wishes or make a decision without their consent. At the time everyone seemed to be on the same page. Fast forward 6 months to last week. Dee and I settled on centerpieces for the table settings. I was at the store picking up material when I ran into Rays mother. We started chatted and I showed her the centerpiece idea (a lot of what we\u2019re doing is DIY to cut cost). MIL made a face and said she didn\u2019t like that and had her own ideas for what we could do. I told her I didn\u2019t quite care. If she wanted to tell Dee her ideas and Dee tells me she\u2019d like to change the centerpieces I\u2019d do what I needed to do, otherwise I needed to go. A few days later I got a call from Ray saying I was out of line and if his mother wanted a certain kind of centerpiece than I should have brought that to Dee not told his mother I didn\u2019t care about her wants for the wedding. I asked Ray what Dee had to say and he said she couldn\u2019t talk right now but he was sure she agreed. I\u2019ve known Dee since we were 12 and she\u2019s never had a problem telling me when I am wrong. Dee\u2019s mother called me and said I was being a bit of an asshole. Dee won\u2019t answer my calls and I keep getting a call from an unknown number who I am assuming is Rays mother. I think I did exactly what I would\u2019ve wanted someone else to do especially knowing my mother likes to butt in where she has no say. But maybe I could\u2019ve said it nicer? AITA?\nEdit: I work in event planning not wedding planning. I am not getting paid to do this. I was asked by my friend. \u201cBeing tact\u201d is not apart of my job. The company/person who pays for the event gets an opinion and that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve had one instance like this in my professional life and I handled it the same way. I\u2019ve been told trying to be polite can sometimes come off as being a doormat or that person may think they can get away with bullying me into the idea. Just for the people who keep mentioning I need to be more professional in my job\nUpdate: spoke to Dee this morning. She\u2019s not upset with me at all. She specially asked me to be the coordinator because she knew I\u2019d be blunt with anyone about what the plans are. She spoke to Ray and apparently his mother and her opinions has been a longstanding argument. She had not gotten back to me because she\u2019d been questioning a lot of other issues steaming from the same problem. I told her I can step down or have a one on one with the MIL to apologize for my tone and reiterate my purpose", "created_utc": 1696303890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yhe1x/aita_for_telling_my_friends_mil_i_dont_care_what/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you told her you didn\u2019t care.\n\nSomething like \u201cI\u2019m sure you can appreciate, Dee and Ray are the only ones who can change the plan - but I am sure if you tell them your ideas, they will incorporate them if they like them! But as I said at the beginning, I won\u2019t be doing anything which goes against their wishes or that they haven\u2019t explicitly asked for. I know you\u2019ll understand\u201d", "I'd say mostly NTA  and now poor Dee is hammered by everyone everywhere and has no clue what she did want as opposed to now what everyone else wants.", "NTA.\n\nYou were right to tell that beeach of a MIL where to get off, and posters who speak of \"tact\" are professional doormats who cave to bullies like this MIL. Tact doesn't work on a bully.\n\nIf I were you, I would get out of this gig, because even Dee is terrified of standing up to the gang. Her groom is a mama's boy, so she has no foundation in planning the wedding anymore and MIL and mama's boy have taken over.\n\nYou will be miserable if you try to pursue this job. Everyone's an AH except you.", " NTA. And this is why I refuse to go into wedding planning. Some people just can\u2019t accept that you are working with the bride and groom and NOT every Tom, Dick and Harry that is involved. I would have the exact same response as you.\n\nTbh Dee is a bit of the AH here, if she wanted her MIL to have an opinion she should have told you and most definitely should have spoken to you about the issue and not everyone else. Maybe she isn\u2019t the friend you thought?  Or is being influenced by her future husband and in laws?", "Slightly ESH.\n\nYeah, you could've just said \"You'll have to talk to Dee about that. Right now, this is what she's chosen and I don't want to go against her\". But MIL shouldn't be trying to make decisions without consulting Ray and Dee, especially when she's not paying for anything.", "Definite NTA\n\nBut you won't be in event planning very long without learning the phrase: \"Wow! That's a fascinating idea!  I'm sure that \\[insert name here\\] would love to hear all about it! They're the boss, haha!\"", "Soft YTA. You did the right thing. Your client is Dee, not her MIL. The only reason I am saying YTA is how you said it. Maybe asking if she had discussed the idea with Dee and asking what Dee\u2019s thought were. Or suggesting another group meeting to see if there were changes since your last meeting. Saying you don\u2019t care about her wants is tacky and rude. She isn\u2019t your client but should still be spoken to nicely.", "NTA. You were clear from the beginning. Its literally your job to be the bad guy to interference like MIL is doing. What you could have done was listened to her (or ignored her) and say \"I'll let the coupl know you have thoughts on the centerpieces\" and leave.\n\nGroup chat with everyone in. Clear up the situation. Inform them what went down and say in no uncertain terms will you be going behind the couples back to make changes to things they have already decided on. \n\nRemind them of the conversation from a few months back where you specified to everyone that you will only be doing what the bride and groom decide together and if they keep making demands remond them that RAYS PARENTS aren't paying for anything.", "If Dee isn't answering your calls, I'd be concerned about that.\n\nIf she carries on ghosting you, pull out of organising the wedding for her. It's not worth the shit being hurled your way, friend or otherwise.\n\nNTA", "I've  seen this situation before. NTA. May I suggest in future that you agree on a password with the bride. That way, when people other than your client call to make changes saying they were approved, you can say you will make those changes if the contracted client gives the password approval. This approach has lessoned the headaches of my friend in her business.", "If Dee won't answer the phone, you can't plan a wedding for her. I suggest emailing her and stepping down. If she wants to continue with your services, she can contact you but I think this friendship is probably over. While I understand why you told MiL you didn't care, if you plan events for a living, you surely know that tact is key.\n\nESH - you for not being more tactful, Dee for not talking to you and ignoring your calls.", "YTA, not for your stance, but for how you said it. You'd think that working with clients, you'd have learnt to be more careful about your phrasing. There are very polite ways to disagree with someone and now you've created an issue where there might not have been one.", "Always hard to judge a human interaction based on a description, but it sounds like YTA. How hard is it to just say \"as we discussed when I started working on this, I'm doing what Dee wants, so you'll need to talk to her about that\"?", "Soft YTA. You set a boundary in the beginning, which was a good one. But when you started showing things to her, it was not your place. It's up to your client to tell her in laws about her plans if/when she chooses to. Forget that she's a friend for a second. You do NOT share details about a client or their event without the client giving the ok prior to it. Not only that, but by doing it, you opened a door for an opinion. Then you reacted rudely. Don't tell her if you don't want an opinion. The fact that your friend isn't  answering is telling. You have caused turmoil that she now has to deal with. \nMy best friend is currently planning her wedding. My SO and I offered his family hunt camp as the venue, and admittedly it is very rustic. There's no electricity without a generator or running water. The driveway is 1.5 miles long, and is barely wide enough for a truck, with a steep hill on one side and a drop off on the other. But it's 1400 acres of beautiful land, and a private lake, with a cabin and event tents we are offering 100% free. When her mother visited it, she insulted it up and down, even calling it a junkyard, because there was a load of firewood that hadn't been stacked. It wasn't my job to shut her down. It was my job to support my friend and help her with the stress of planning. That's your job here too.", "YtA  for being dismissive to a clients parent", "YTA\n\nThe problem is using the term \"I don't care what you think.\u201d You could have said to the MIL ..have you thought of bringing your suggestions to Dee? Or you could have said...I am obligated to follow through on the bride's wishes. It's the \"I don't care about your opinion\" that comes off as too blunt. \n\nHaving said that, a big part of your job is being diplomatic which is not easy at times under stress and shared budgets.", "YTA\n\nBeing tactful IS your job here. You were very clear up front about who made the decisions. So, no, you don't change things on MIL's say. But, by being a jerk to MIL, you've caused everyone a bunch of stress. \n\nYou could have deflected this a bunch of ways. \"Oh! You're very creative! I'll confirm what Dee wants!\"\n\nWhat it seems like happened is that you got your feelings hurt and made this about you, creating a problem for the bride. It's. Not. About. You.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A few days later I got a call from Ray saying I was out of line and if his mother wanted a certain kind of centerpiece than I should have brought that to Dee not told his mother I didn\u2019t care about her wants for the wedding.\" .. Sit them all down, and tell the facts: MIL is trying to make you change the wedding, and the groom told you to do that over Dee's wishes. And tell them to solve it between themselves, and your agreement with THEM is you work for Dee - If they want to change that, they have to have DEE tell you that. Or dont sit them down, send them ALL a message. And if they don't like that, they can find someone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I\u2019ve had one instance like this in my professional life and I handled it the same way. \" ..

So I'm firmly NTA. \n\nI will say, it does seem like your people skills need some work if you work in event planning but can't spot a person who will cause trouble like MIL.
