I\u2019m sorry for the pain this must cause.", "NTA\n\nThe key point is here that you are justified, with him acting weird and super defensive and refusing any compromise. Too many red flags, you have to find a way to talk it out imo", "So many red flags here between both of you.  \n\nWhat's the \"past relationship problems\" you noted on?  I'm guessing you cheated before, people who have cheated often have a heightened paranoia of their partner doing the same to them.\n\nHe's friends with a past hookup, it's possible their relationship evolved out of a hookup and into a true friendship, but given their past and her current employment field I wouldn't bet on that. \n\nLet's say he does show you the conversation and by some chance it happens to be strictly platonic, then what?  You've already made yourself look like an insanely jealous ass and it would have been for nothing.\n\nWhat if it is a platonic relationship, but a very close friendship, are you going to be able to handle them being friends? \n\nThe two of you have a lot to sort out and it's gonna take a lot of work and commitment to make it work", "What relationship?

I believe you are right when you say he is projecting a lot of things he is saying & doing onto you.", "NTA but if he called me \"crazy\" I'd just leave him tbh. Two years isn't worth the suspicion and drama, especially because he doesn't want to make the relationship public after that long. Big red flags here.", "Regardless of whos the ah here (and you are NTA) its time to pack up and ditch him. Hes hiding your relationship, messages his fwb and gets defensive when confronted", "ESH He's all over social media, but there are no pics of you? It sounds like he doesn't want anyone to know you are dating. Maybe you are on the side in his world?", "First, is he private or is he hiding the relationship you have? There's a difference. Not wanting to blast things online is not a big deal. Or not wanting to tell parents yet until it reaches a certain phase. But secrecy is weird. Figure that out.\n\nBeing uncomfortable with this is normal. But so far you don't have any evidence he crossed a line and he might not have.\n\nAsking for the things you did is both normal and invasive at the same time. I get where it comes from and why you're uncomfortable. But the reaction of a guilty person **and** an innocent person is probably going to be pretty similar to it. \"No, you're nuts if you think I'm going to let you invade my privacy like that.\"\n\nDemanding them like you did is just guaranteed to start a fight unless your SO is spineless. That's where I might say YTA.\n\nNobody has 0 confidants. He's going to talk to someone about relationship troubles. He could be upset you talked to a lot of people and it got around more than that you talked to someone. And we're back to guilty and innocent look the same. If I talked to someone about relationship problems that's not a chat I want to share with the relationship trouble. If I was up to no good that's also not one I'd want to share. You can't tell innocent and guilty apart here.\n\nI can't judge what he is without info. I can say you had an asshole moment in your approach. But if you said \"Hey, you know what, if that's a friend you have we're not going to work out\" I wouldn't think you're TA either.\n\nIt's complicated.", "NTA, they always call us crazy when we call them out on their bullshit", "I agree with all of this and can confirm from sad experience that when your partner becomes secretive and then hostile when you push the issue, there's almost certainly some kind of cheating going on or about to start.  OP just needs to ask herself what a caring boyfriend would have done in this situation.  They would have been open, reassuring and willing to change their behaviour to show that they had nothing to hide. This guy is doing none of those things.", "Tbh I never post anything on Instagram or any other social net about my private life. At all. I find it more healthy. But I don't hide it either. Secret conversation that he is hiding is more disturbing in my opinion.", "No, no one has cheated in this relationship(as far as I know). The problems in our relationship were caused by moving into a new country one year ago, and his difficulty of finding a job for many months while I was working full time. But I know that he cheated in previous relationships.", ">pen pals\n\nWe live together bro since the third month we got together", "Yes... a few months ago he suspected me that I was hiding my phone when he came into the room, and hiding different messages. Then he confronted me. I immediately just gave him my phone, as I didn't have anything to hide, but he didn't want to look through it. Now I think that was another projection..", "All you need to know really is your last sentence. If he put in some effort to build trust id maybe consider that he changed, but hes being shady again", "OP, I think your gut is right about this. Seems very sus overall"]}
