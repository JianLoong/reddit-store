She looked really disappointed by my answer though.\n\nTold me that I gave her a 'weird' answer and should have said her boobs or her ass like a 'normal' guy, and that choosing her muscles made her feel 'masculine'. Was I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE : Just talked to her half an hour ago. I told her that I find her whole body attractive, including her boobs and butt. She said she was worried she's not curvy enough so I told her that that's not the case at all. She was also caught off guard because she didn't think a guy would find muscles on a girl sexy, so I reassured her that I meant what I said and also told her that her dedication to weight-lifting is also attractive.
