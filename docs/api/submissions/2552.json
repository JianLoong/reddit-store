I'm single and can admit I have a bit of anxiety about Sky as I had a complicated pregnancy.\n\nI was getting the baby bag ready so we could all go for a walk and Friend1 (25f) was holding Sky. When I came back in the room, Friend2 (20f) was dangling Sky upside down, holding her by her waist and hips. I freaked out and yelled \"wtf are you doing\" or something similar, can't remember exactly.\n\nFriend2 took a few seconds to put Sky the right way up and I told her that it was dangerous and could have hurt her. I will admit, I don't know if this is true or not, but I've never held Sky upside down because it seems like the sort of thing that could easily injure a baby. And I worry that she could have wriggled and been hurt.\n\nIt was really awkward after that and I didn't know if I should have apologised for yelling out of shock.

But just for your peace of mind: at six months old, a baby can be held securely around the middle/hips and tipped upside down to amuse it.   So long as it\u2019s done gently and the baby isn\u2019t dropped or shaken or otherwise treated with violence, it\u2019s not dangerous.   Your baby is not hurt, she will be okay.  You don\u2019t need to take her to a doctor or anything.", "Man, I turn all my nieces and nephews upside down at 6 months. They love it! Obviously you have to be careful\u2014holding by the hips/waist/thighs, smooth controlled movements, not for too long, pay attention to their reaction. But vestibular play is a lot of fun! NAH", "Nah. \n\nBabies are pretty tough and some even love being held upside down. All my cousins loved being flipped- they would giggle and make a game of it. \n\nIt seems like your a first mom - it\u2019s okay to be anxious.", "NTA - I think I'm picturing what they were doing, and while that's fun times at 1+, a 6 mo old doesn't have the muscle development for that type of play. In my mind kiddo is held around legs/hips/lower back and, kinda bends backwards while adult leans forward. Sometimes belly raspberries occur?", "NTA\n\nDon't do that with babies, particularly not with other peoples's babies.", "NAH. While I don't think you're an asshole as it was an involuntary reaction, I do think you overreacted. Regardless of what I think it is your child and ultimately it is your say what kind of play they engage in depending on what you deem safe.\n\nI would ask that you reflect on why you think this is unsafe though. Babies can be dropped, or wriggle out of your arms in any position. As long as whoever is holding them upside down is holding them in a secure manner and not for too long why not let them have fun?", "NAH \u2014 You just went into maternal instincts and friend stopped right away. \n\nMaybe just message your friend and explain that you didn\u2019t mean to shout, and it was just in the moment. Maybe she meant it in a fun way\u2014oddly enough, some people do that. As someone else said, they can risk that with their own kid.", "NTA. Your reaction was completely normal.", "NTA - You were just worried about your baby", "Oh you are NTA \n\nBut it is not a bad thing holding a baby upside down. It actually helps their inner ear and balance. We are recommended to do it where im from, but of course its only if the baby likes it. But I do it to my baby (8 months) and he absolutely loves it. \nBut I get why its a little scary and I would never do it to someone elses child, unless i knew they were ok with it.", "Nta, holding a baby upside down is fine, i do it with my nibling all the time bc she thinks its fun, but i'd never do it if i didn't know the parents were okay with it and since they didn't check with you then they are TA.", "NTA, I'm not sure if it hurts the baby or not is even relevant. Don't do that to a baby that isn't yours unless the parents are OK with it. If she saw you doing that to the baby, then sure, MAYBE do it with a parent around. Asking always clears things up as well.\n\n\nIf I walk in the room and don't feel comfortable with how someone is playing with my kid, I'd do the same thing.", "Yeah your friends doesn't understand age. A 6 month old still has the soft spot on their head. I don't think encouraging extra blood flow to their head by hanging upside down is a good idea. NTA but also maybe just mention the age thing to your friend. Before I had kids, I had an incorrect understanding of what you can do with kids at certain ages. It's a learning process but also with a baby, yikes. I bet that was really scary for you, esp with the complications of your pregnancy.", "NAH. \n\nIt was just your maternal reaction, maybe explain to her you didn't mean it like that but it was just your natural  reaction", "NTA they can do that with there own baby but you should never risk someone else\u2019s baby for \u201cfun\u201d accidents can and do happen", "NTA bc first tome mom and they scared you. But I will tell you it doesn\u2019t hurt them. When my little was a baby we took her to the chiropractor (specializes in babies and she was amazing!!!). Anyway...at the first appt she told me she was going to dangle the baby upside down. Said it takes a long time for their bodies to get used to normal life and that hanging them upside down is the most gentle way to adjust them. Baby did amazing. Didn\u2019t phase her in the least bc she spent all those months upside down in the belly.", "NTA who in their right mind would think that was ok to do to a 6month old baby!!!", "NTA, but you were a bit dramatic, but I understand as it was a shock to you", "My daughter loved being held upside down by her ankles. When older she loved to be swung side to side upside down. Maybe a little older than 6 months, but I am not sure. She'd laugh and laugh.", "NAH. Despite your friend not being around babies I feel like it\u2019s common knowledge not to hold a 6 month old baby upside down. I\u2019m picturing this happening and I couldn\u2019t imagine myself reacting any differently than you did, if not even worse", "Nta....but the stuff my brother did to his baby girl as an infant and even now lol its not for the faint of heart lol yeah we did crazy stuff with baby at that age....most babies giggle and drool..but your baby your rules.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sure if actually hanging a baby that young upside down is harmful or not, but wriggling like you said could've caused her to slip and get hurt.", "It's your baby, but there's nothing wrong with what they did and I'd actually think it's probably beneficial as long as they didn't do it roughly, making sure kids get lots of sensory input, including vestibular, is important for development.", "NTA because baby I guess, but I'm a baby dangler, a 6 month old baby can be roughed around some and be just fine though... I got yelled at because I palmed a newborn's head once hahaha, for context my wife calls me Lenny on account i \"don't understand how strong\" I am, she thought I was gonna pop the baby. You should dangle your baby, babies love weird stuff, unless she looks uncomfortable then your g2g", "NTA.      \n\n\nThat's a fun way to play with a toddler, but 6 month old babies could be hurt like that.  They really don't have the muscle tone for serious roughhousing.", "Hmmm NAH.  First time Mum is allowed to be nervous about stuff, allowed to overreact.  Friends probably understood.  Friend is doing pretty normal thing with baby, probably didn't think anything of it.  Apologize and explain that you're just anxious like most new parents.  At six months being held by the waist shouldn't cause any issues, nor is being tipped upside down or 'flown' around or anything else so long as you're sensible.  This is literally how I used to get all my cousins to like me when they were babies.  Given that the youngest of them are now 12 trying to pick them up is getting impractical though!", "NTA Don't let this person near your baby again.", "Wouldn\u2019t that be NAH then?", "Yeah, also this kind of play can be good to \"calibrate\" the brain, helps the kid develop a better sense of balance and spatial awareness. My parents couldn't play with me like that due to health reasons (mine) and probably due to that i had to have physiotherapy as a young child to learn stuff like balance and not falling on my face every few steps (my balance and spatial awareness is still kinda bad, i have good and bad days)\n\nBut the friend is an AH not to ask if this kind of play is okay", "> Babies can be dropped, or wriggle out of your arms in any position.\n\nSo why risk it with a baby that's not yours?", "I just want to point out that the soft spot isn't going to be affected by hanging upside down. Being dropped would be a problem, but the blood flow thing isn't. My back soft spot never hardened, and it never stopped me from hanging from the monkeybars.", "I played with all of my nieces and nephews this way. You\u2019re not swinging them around like a toy, just dipping them backwards or carefully flipping them over. They really enjoy it!", "Why isn't it OK?  Obviously you need to be careful to avoid shaking the head and neck, but a quick Google isn't telling me anything against a baby simply being upside down for a little while.", "It actually is ok. They are still adjusting to life outside of your belly where they spent a lot of time upside down.", "It\u2019s actually perfectly safe as long as you don\u2019t drop them.", "What do you think is wrong with it?", "I think horseplay limits for fragile infants should probably be agreed upfront with the parents.", "No because if the mom says don\u2019t do it you shouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nLike if the mom isn\u2019t comfortable giving their baby French fries, you don\u2019t do it.", "They didn't do anything dangerous or wrong. OP is just overprotective, which is normal with the first kid", "Because it's not her baby.", "Well sure, but they couldn\u2019t have known that *before* she said it. It wasn\u2019t harmful or malicious, just her preference.", "So are you allowed to do anything with someone else's baby?  Jiggle it gently on your knee?  Play peek-a-boo?\n\nOr is it just turning upside-down, and if so why?"]}
