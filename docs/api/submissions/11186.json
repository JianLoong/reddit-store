I will be deployed in 2 weeks, and I suggested she move in with my mom and sisters while I'm deployed. She said no. I come from a culture where living with family even as adults is very normal. I told her this would save us money and she would get help with the baby, and it would make me more comfortable knowing she wouldn't be all alone while I'm gone. Again, she said no. Her reason is that my family is very invasive with our business and wants a chance to raise our baby without my family telling her how to parent. (We come from different cultures, so she does a lot of things differently than my family would have and they let her know how they would do things.) she isn't loud, blunt or outgoing, or social like my family, and I know often they overwhelm her. My sisters and mom have also crossed her boundaries a few times with the baby, but my wife was able to communicate how that made her feel, and they've stopped since. \n    I then asked her if she was working while I was deployed, and she said that wasn't the agreement. (I volunteered to deploy, and she supported my decision, but in exchange, she got to stay home with the baby that year and not work. I agreed since my income would be able to support our lifestyle) I got mad at her and told her my mom was a single mom who worked full time and took care of 3 kids. If my mom can do it, she could  too. She's not the only military mom to work and take care of a kid. I told her that if she wasn't going to move in with my family so I could save on rent, she should then work to help contribute to the income. \n My wife is now angry at me and haven't spoken to me since. My family think I'm in the right. My mom said being a stay at home mom is lazy when shes capable of working. However, my best friend told me I needed to apologize, and if I made a promise that she didn't have to work, then I needed to honor it.

There\u2019s a reason the divorce rate is so astronomical fo active military. Think about the actions that would support your wife and family.", "YTA. Your friend is right.\n\nFirst of all I don't agree with your reasoning. I think if your mother could sustain a family on one income, so can you.\n\nI also think it is unrealistic and borderline cruel to expect someone to decide on, much less make and implement, a major change in their lifestyle (where they move or whether they work) a week after having a first baby. That's already a change in lifestyle.\n\nAnd while I don't see anything wrong with you wanting to revisit your old agreement, verbal abuse is an unacceptable way of trying to change an agreement. Your wife said no. Deal with it without insulting her.", "YTA. We literally get extra pay for rent and groceries. She has support as our community has some of the most supportive people! She has so many resources to help her. You\u2019ll be gone voluntarily, she can do what she wants during that time as long as it doesn\u2019t disrespect the marriage. If my husband tried to pull this on me I\u2019d be livid.", "YTA", "So...you know all the reasons why your wife doesn't want to live with your family and agreed she didn't have to work, all of which are very valid, and promised that she wouldn't have to work, and yet expect her to do the exact opposite?\n\nYTA, if you come home from deployment to an empty house and divorce papers I wouldn't be surprised.", "YTA - I ger your perspective but there are a lot of things you're not seeing from her side. Of course your family sees your side. You're going to be gone and she's going to have to deal with the exhaustion of dealing with a newborn and also the exhaustion of dealing with your family. You acknowledge that your family intrudes on her all the time. That's not an emotionally healthy situation for your wife or your baby. She doesn't want to raise your baby with your family their way where she's outnumbered and they have very different ideas of how things should be. She wants to raise your baby in the way that she thinks is ideal for the family you formed with her..\n\nThese choices have long-term consequences beyond saving money. Your wife working and leaving the newborn who's not able to communicate what's happening to it  can permanently affect the child's attachment pattern, intelligence, emotional regulation, and psychological health. Lots of people work with newborns. Your mom worked and was a single parent -that doesn't mean that's what your wife wants to do or that it's ideal for your baby. Plus it sounds like that's not the deal you made with your wife when you volunteered to deploy. \n\nYour whole message comes across like you trust your family to care for your baby and your finances but you don't trust your wife. You need to make some allowances for her to do what she perceives is best for her and you and the baby because she is charged with staying here and raising your child while you're deployed - and both your situation and hers are extremely challenging. You sound anxious about the whole situation, which is understandable, but you need to have some empathy for your wife and what she needs to do to cope with the situation.", "YTA. Suddenly forcing her to work when your infant is only 1 week old just sounds like another manipulation to get your mother to raise your infant because then you\u2019d need childcare. \u201cIf I\u2019m not going to save on rent then contribute to the income\u201d. You\u2019ll end up spending on daycare.", "YTA. Dude I get it, you don\u2019t want to be deployed and worried about your family. But. Your wife is clearly uncomfortable with your family and how they like to push boundaries. She has had to push back a few times and probably sees your home as a save space to retreat back to. Also, don\u2019t compare your wife to your mother, that\u2019s not fair and I would have hit the roof if you said to me what you said to her.", "YTA\n\n\n\"I will not take care of my child for an extented period of time because I want to do something else.

I mean, she is selfish for not giving up absolutly everything I demand, so I can do what ever the fuck I want.\"\n\n\n\nDude... think about it. Your wife is NOT a single mother. YOU have responsiblities. You made a deal with your wife- no child care responsiblity for her no fincial responsiblity. Now you call her lazy as you got what you wanted. Of course your mommy doesn't think yhou need to stand by your word. \n\n\nDoes you word means nothing to you?\n\n\nYou call her lazy. Would it be okay for her to call you a liar and a dead beat? I mean.. you did lie. And you also try to put most of the responsiblity on your wife- child care and finacially. Just imagin her talking about you and judging you just HALF as harshly as you do. \n\n\n\nDo you aspire to be like your own father? Or maybe, you aim a little higher?\n\n\nAnd don't think you fool anyone. Step one would be her working or moving in. Then there would either be child care costs or free child care avaliable- so she could work. \n\n\nYou want her to give your mom the child and support herself and your child and be free of everything while having the claim to being a father.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, if she's the one pushing a baby out of her body, she needs time to properly heal, so going to work a couple weeks after giving birth is a bad idea.\n\nSecondly, you agreed to her staying home with the baby for a year because you volunteered to deploy. You don't get to change the terms of your agreement because she doesn't want to live with your family.  \n\n> if she wasn't going to move in with my family so I could save on rent,\n\nThis right here, this is exactly why you're an asshole.

You stay on this path and you will be paying alimony and child support which will be more expensive then your so called rent savings.", "YTA - Big time. You made an agreement then went back on it. Being a stay at home parent to a newborn IS a full time job and it sounds like she would be in an unhealthy mental/emotional situation if she lived with your family.

Yes, mothers can raise children while having a job. But your baby is just one week old, for fuck's sake! In any half-decent country one of the parents (95% of times the mother) stay at home with the kid for 1.5-2 years in the least.

To have to live with pushy in-laws is difficult enough, let alone for someone learning how to be a new mother.  And even had you not made the promise, far better she lives by herself to figure it out, especially if there's a chance of your mom pulling the whole \"my house, my rules\" card. You do NOT need a civil war over how your child should be raised.", "You want her to live like a single mum? Well keep up the good work and she just might YTA", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou made an agreement and now you're going back on it.    Children are better off if they can be with their parents, especially from newborn to (typically) at least three years old.  \n\n\nYou're also the ah for trying to force your wife to live with your mom.  Without you there as a buffer your family would just run roughshod over her, and she knows it.  That's why she doesn't want to do that.  \n\n\nHONOR your agreement.  It will be the best thing for your baby.", "YTA. 100%.", "YTA\n\nI hope she finds the resources to leave you, because you come across as beginning stages of financial abuse. \n\nYour wife had a baby A WEEK ago, and you're demanding she either moves to live with your family or you round about way told her you'll cut her off any income. Because that's how it sounded to me.", "YTA 100%! Your family needs to butt out! She doesn\u2019t need to conform to your culture, she has her own. You made a promise, if you don\u2019t plan to honor it than don\u2019t deploy.", "YTA, incredibly so. You had an agreement that she could be SAHM, which is absolutely a full time job, and now are trying to go back on it. You're pressuring her to live with people who make her uncomfortable and try to get in the way of her parenting. Calling her lazy? She deserves better.", "YTA. You make promise, you keep it. And please, don\u2019t compare your wife to your mother. That\u2019s another AH move.", "YTA. She just had a baby. You are supposed to ask HER what you can do to help, not tell her what to do. \n\nShe's following your a$s around for you to live your dream career, so you better tell her how thankful you are that she is doing that. \n\nYou better set boundaries with YOUR FAMILY because they better not give her any advice or judgement. She needs care and compliments. \n\nYou better not be spending any money on your deployment either. \n\nFrom: an active duty spouse, my husband has 24 years in and counting.", "YTA, is this REALLY how you wanna leave things with your wife before deployment? You made a promise, you don\u2019t get to just go back on your word now. Also, your family sounds toxic, your mom probably isn\u2019t the person you should be listening to in this matter. Your wife is a week postpartum and it sounds like she\u2019s already facing criticism from your family, and they are known to cross boundaries. Do you really think that stopped? Because I imagine that if your wife is left alone with them while you\u2019re deployed they\u2019re going to cross boundaries every chance they get since she\u2019ll be in a vulnerable position. If you can afford for your wife to be a SAHM for the time being, let her so she has time to bond with the baby, she\u2019ll basically be all the baby has since you won\u2019t be there and she shouldn\u2019t have the stress of being a working single mom when that isn\u2019t necessary.", "YTA. You made an agreement, you stick to it. You word is your word. Surely they teach you this in the military. Why are you even here?", "YTA. You're on the fast track to divorce. Grow a spine, tell your family to stay in their lane and support your wife who *just gave birth a week ago* jfc.", "Thousand percent YTA. \nYour wife spent 9 mo the CARRYING your child and then pushed him/her out of her. \nAnd now you want to leave her alone with the child AND you want her to work? \nIn the military they literally double your pay when you get married so that you can take care of your family. \n\nAlso you can\u2019t force your wife to stay with your family. The fact that your mom sided with you proves a point. Your mom doesn\u2019t care for your wife\u2019s wellbeing. Besides PP is a sensitive time. Your wife needs to spend time recovering and taking care of the baby. \n\nApologize immediately.", "Careful. If you continue down this path you might come home to the locks changed and your shit on the front lawn. That\u2019s what I would do to you. YTA", "YTA and your going back on your word", "YTA. Your marriage is between you and your wife. The rest of your family has no business injecting themselves into the midst of your marital financial dispute. You also shouldn't be enlisting your family's help to pressure your wife; that's a punk-ass move. Show some respect to your wife and keep your financial matters between you and her.", "The baby is literally a WEEK old and already your mom and sister have crossed boundaries multiple times? I don't blame your wife in the slightest.   \n\n\nYTA - you married your wife and chose to have a child with her. That is the family whose back you need to have now. Your family will not take this well at all because it's likely you have never meaningfully stood up to them. And PLEASE stop unfavourably comparing your wife to your mother.", "Yes, YTA, and you are wayyyyyy too attached to your mom. She may have stopped overtly trampling your wife's boundaries, but she's clearly still trying to influence you and your view of your wife. Your wife and child need to be your top priority now, not mommy.\n\nAnd PS, there is NOTHING lazy about staying at home with a baby full-time. It is a 24/7 job.\n\nHonor your agreement with your wife, and help her make sure that she has a network in place that will *actually* support her. Wishing you a safe deployment.", "YTA and I seriously question why this poor woman chose to procreate with you. Not only do you try to throw her to the woolfs aka you mom and sis, who ALWAYS cross her boundaries, you alsa went back on your word that she can be stay at home mom for the next year or so.", "YTA big time. You volunteered for a deployment right after your wife gives birth and now you're expecting her to go right back to work? Or move into your family's home? Even if they got along do you know how incredibly invasive it is to have family there 24/7 when trying to raise a newborn? It's one thing for them to come help or to live nearby but it's another to be there the entire time. Plus you're going back on your promise. \nIt's not lazy or easy to be a SAHM especially when your partner is deployed. Get over yourself and go apologize to your wife.", "YTA you made an agreement then changed your mind and shamed her when she didn\u2019t give in to your demands. Also you all need yo cut the SAHM is lazy thing. It\u2019s 24/7 on with little to no breaks since you\u2019ll be gone, no income, no sick days and apparently dealing with you and your family being AH; it\u2019s a lot of work, be grateful she\u2019s willing to raise your child together so you can work. Also she\u2019s a week post partum, support her, don\u2019t pick stupid fights", "SHE HAD A BABY 1 WEEK AGO! ONE! O.N.E. And you\u2019re already on her case to WORK?!! What in the fuck is wrong with you?!\n\n\nYou admit you have a boundary pushing, intrusive family that are already questioning how your wife is raising HER baby. And yet you want her to LIVE WITH THEM?!\n\n\nYou are the suckiest and worst and biggest asshole of husbands, without a doubt do not pass go the worst. \n\n\nDon\u2019t be shocked that when you come home, she isn\u2019t there waiting. YTA and need a fucking wake up call", "YTA and everyone here has told you the many, MANY reasons why. \n\nBut I'm going to add one more. Your wife had a baby \"about a week ago\". She's still bleeding heavily, whilst internal organs shift back into position, dealing with leaking boobs and sleep deprivation all whilst bonding with a brand new life and you choose NOW to start this shit??\n\nThe very fact that your wife has chosen to do this alone rather than with the \"support\" of your overbearing family tells me everything I need to know about them. Your family is controlling so stop running to mommy every time your wife does something you don't like.\n\nAlso \"lazy\" being at home with a week old baby? You know fucking nothing and just regurgitate bullshit your mom feeds you. Grow up.", "Dude. Seriously. Knock it off before she serves you with divorce papers. \n\n>I volunteered to deploy, and she supported my decision, but in exchange, she got to stay home with the baby that year and not work. I agreed since my income would be able to support our lifestyle\n\nShe's one week after giving birth, two weeks from you leaving her alone and you've turned into a raving idiot. Stick to your agreement. Shut up about her moving in with your intrusive family. Stop taking advice from your family and knock off the insults about her being lazy.  YTA.", "YTA \n>Her reason is that my family is very invasive with our business and wants a chance to raise our baby without my family telling her how to parent. \n\nTHAT is a good reason for her to not want to live with your family.  \n\n>I volunteered to deploy, and she supported my decision, but in exchange, she got to stay home with the baby that year and not work. I agreed since my income would be able to support our lifestyle\n\nYOU changed the deal, not her.  What right do you have to get mad at her.  She also just gave birth, it's going to be a while before she can work.  Maybe your mom did the same, and that's really sad.  That doesn't mean your wife needs to as well.  \n\nIf you didn't want your wife to be alone, maybe you shouldn't have agreed to a deployment that means you miss the first year of your baby's life.\n\nYou are TA.  And maybe, you should make decisions about how to be a good husband and father instead of letting your mom tell you how to do it.", "YTA. You made a promise and you need to honor it. And I don't even know your family but I can totally see why your wife wouldn't want them rolling over her as she raises her child. \n\nMaybe once you and your family start to respect her boundaries, your wife will want to start some part-time work, and might let your family do childcare doing that time.", "YTA, I see a Jody in your future.", "YTA. You're a liar and a bully. If I were your wife, I'd file for divorce today and have you served the evening before you leave for a year.\n\nYou don't deserve to call yourself a father or a husband. You're just a manipulative liar.", "YTA and sound incredibly controlling.  Do you like and care about your wife?  Because you don't sound to give 2 shits about her only what your mum wants and money.", "YTA. Big time. Let\u2019s set aside the fact that YOU changed the deal after everything was set and ready to go. \n\nI have to ask, what kind of job your wife is supposed to be working while you\u2019re gone that\u2019ll pay for daycare and be financially beneficial to your family? Because your family watching the baby while she works some minimum wage part time job not only is against the deal you agreed to, it also puts her back to square one with your family raising your baby the way they want. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll save on rent\u201d I have to ask for clarification so\nINFO: Are you in a branch of the US military? Because if you are that \u201cmoney\u201d you\u2019re saving is to house your family that the military pays for.", "YTA\n\nAny doctor with common sense wouldn't clear a woman to go back to work ONLY A WEEK after she just had YOUR child. There's a reason maternity leave is a thing. \n\nAlso how are you a grown ass man that runs to mommy the second your wife calls you out on your bullshit but she's the one with a problem.  You made an agreement, so stick to it. If you think you can force your wife to move in with your overbearing family, you're in for a rude awakening. \n\nI suggest you listen to your friend because if you keep listening to mommy, you're gonna be divorced.", "YTA- you agreed she wouldn't work but clearly in your head the condition was that she'd move in with *your* family.\nYou say they're not invasive and respect her boundaries but then you all sit down and agree that your wife is being lazy for not doing what you all want her to do...\n\nTalk about ganging up on a poor woman who's only had a baby *about a week ago* (????? You don't even know how many days old your baby is)\nIn your wife's shoes I'd move in with my own family, ideally permanently.", "OMG YTA!! \n\nIf your wife has already had her boundaries crossed by your family, can you imagine how much harder it would be to defend herself whilst living with them, and without your support?! She\u2019s right to say no to living with them.\n\nSecondly, your mother shouldn\u2019t be giving her opinion on being a SAHM. Why did you involve her?! She doesn\u2019t get a vote on this. It\u2019s between yourself and your wife. \n\nDon\u2019t blame this on being a \u201ccultural thing\u201d. OP is a mama\u2019s boy who still likes getting her approval.", "YTA. Your mother\u2019s opinions about being a SAHM are irrelevant, and highlight perfectly why she does not want to live with your family. Your wife gave birth a week ago. You should be using the next two weeks to do everything possible to ease into this new phase the way she wants, not the way you want. She is the one who is going to be at home taking care of the baby, so she gets to decide the best way to do it. And she decided it\u2019s NOT with your family. You had an agreement - you don\u2019t get to renege on it because mommy wants you to.", "YTA. I would be filing for divorce while you were away if I were her.", "The wife had the baby last week and you want her back at work. YTA or more likely this is a fake Karma Farmer.", "Of course you went and told your family everything right after the disagreement with your wife! Marriage is between 2 people.\n\nWhen telling your family about it did you mention the part you both agreed to something and then you changed your mind? Or the bit where you think she should just do what you want because \u201cmy over whelming family who trample boundaries and get in her business are just fab people to live with because they save me money.\u201d Apologise please and you may have a wife long term. YTA", "YTA what in the fuck\n She just pushed a baby out of her vagina a week ago and now you want her to go back to work when you PROMISED she could stay home w the baby? What - and I cannot stress this enough- the fuck is wrong w you??\n\nYou are dropping  your responsibilities as a father by pushing for your wife moving in with your meddling family and now you also want her to work just *checks notes* bc mommy dearest raised three kids on her own? Bro, what do you even bring to the table as a father and as a husband then? She'd be better off by hitting you w the big D (divorce, although to be honest, you deserve a dick slapped against your face) and collecting child support. You don't seem to care about your wife or baby, why are you even married in the first place? Why did you bring a baby to this whole mess? Just to comply w the poster of a family man that your culture expects? Bro. Bro.\n\nI want to assume that you remember what it was like to have a single mother working her ass off to feed, clothe and basically raise three kids. I assume that your oldest sibling took care of a few of the parenting roles bc your mom couldn't bc she was working to provide. Why on earth would you want your baby, your own flesh and blood to go through that? Wtf is wrong w you??\n\nI'm aware the army is desperate to fill their quotas lately, but you are a disgrace. Be better, do better. \n\nAnd YTA again just in case I wasn't clear enough.", "YTA. You\u2019re falling into the classic pre-deployment trap of sabotaging your home life. You\u2019re starting drama with your postpartum wife because that\u2019s easier than directly confronting all of your emotions and insecurities. \n\nEnjoy coming home to a divorce! Maybe she\u2019ll find a man who actually wants to be a partner with *her* when shit gets rough, rather than with his mommy.

Where are Reddit awards when you need them. Isn\u2019t not every day pure gold like this comes out!", "Isn't it funny that she is the lazy one while he doesn't want to take physically or financial responsiblity for his child? \n\n\n\"My mom- a single mother- could do it. So my wife, who has me, can do it too. Because why should I be responsible for anything? She is just lazy\" lol", "This right here all of this lol. I say he can say bye bye to married life and start paying child support", "Exactly this!! What an AH.

I would be livid if my husband pulled this shit.", "This one made me giggle", "And let's be fair, maternity leave in this country is worse than a joke.", "He wants her to live the single mom life so... maybe this would be a solution.", "I wouldn't wait that long. He'd be getting served the evening before he left if it was me", "Ohhhhhh I like your answer", "That's a good point. It doesn't help having a martyr for a mom, either. It all feeds into making his wife the target for his negative emotions. Sad.", "Yeah, like\u2026 one week postpartum! Her stitches haven\u2019t even dissolved yet! Lazy cannot be a word applied to her right now!", "Pay child support to his mom, as wife took the fuck off since he wants his mom to raise the kid anyway.", "The pre-deployment relationship self-sabotage is more common than you\u2019d think. So much so that chaplains and counselors will often try to warn couples beforehand. \n\nThe key difference here is those of us who aren\u2019t complete idiots try to tamp down that instinct to start fights and create emotional distance. Op has instead opted to embrace it and try to completely nuke his newborn\u2019s family unit."]}
