OP is already burnt out and malnourished. Planning and cooking healthy meals from these ingredients is a lot more time and labor-intensive than eating ramen. Of course, she could save herself money and energy by dropping the boyfriend but that\u2019s her decision as well.", "Indeed, I know this. I have a small farm and sustain myself with this and help out people in my area, but who will cook?  Potatoes are great, nutritious. I used Ramen as an example. BF is obviously picky. Guarantee he will find nothing appealing but what he wants.", "I've never seen Mac and cheese anywhere but the states.  It is a totally American thing to eat, boxed Mac and cheese lol as well as a lot of the other processed crap there.", "Their loans might be private, not federal.", "Good. Dude is a selfish jerk. He wants takeout then he should have made his work deadlines and he should go get a second job", "Sorry I have to disagree \ud83d\udcaf. She is sitting at work hungry. She is borrowing money from her parents for THEIR food and he is wanting takeout? A relationship IMHO is about MUTUAL respect. He isn\u2019t showing that he cares about anyone but himself.", "While this is fair, we also don't have a picture of how much OP is working. If she has even one day off, a couple hours of food prep could cook all of these in a big stew for the whole week. You can certainly still make these things work if money is a bigger concern, and big batch food prep would lessen any stress of having to prepare anything else throughout the week, along with reducing the financial strain of buying junk food.", "Exactly. Ramen isn\u2019t for me. I would rather but 20pounds of potatoes and work wonders with them. I used Ramen as an example. I could be off base, but I don\u2019t think BF is an \u201ceasy\u201d keeper.", "They might have done a big grocery shop at the start of the month...  especially as she said last month they had to borrow money for food, so they would have presumably been eager to buy stuff as soon as they got their last paychecks...   still, yes, unclear!", "My brother's church in Miami does the same. I'm in London, and the borough where I live has foodbanks. Please explore these options, OP.", "You are spot on! He needs to help pick up the slack.", "Have you looked into it recently? Some of the reasoning for the cancellation, payments pauses, the waivers, etc were because federal loan companies were actively lying to borrowers about the income based program.", "I understand why -- private loans and all that -- but it bites.", "I have- I looked at the application and did an online calculator. With my income, it would step from 400 to 800 over time. \n\nUnfortunately it doesn't take dependents and other responsibilities into account.", "Public loans too. I dont have any private loans- I just make too much to qualify for anything but not enough to not be paycheck to paycheck.", "I see. Just wanted to make sure since those companies have been lying through their teeth for years. I think some calculation changes might be taking effect next year. I can't remember if it's January or March when it happens. I think it's undergrad loans only though", "I already consolidated so I did not think I was eligible to do that again. I'll have to look into that with my time off the end of Dec.", "Hmm, I wouldn't know the answer to that, sorry. I hope you can get some relief, though! Navient is trash \ud83d\ude29", "BF needs a part-time job to make up the deficit.  May I suggest the fast food industry?", "Omg NTA!!!! I\u2019d be livid. I\u2019ve lived very cheaply for years\u2026.yes it sucks but it can be done. What I never did was buy takeout. You need to be careful and maximize nutrition/$", "NTA, but you should NOT be going hungry while your bf is getting takeout.  How selfish.  Especially when you\u2019re the one covering most of the bills. \n\nLook into loan delay/deferral programs immediately.   And maybe look into dropping this fella.   He seems to have no clue.", "NTA and you should go back home if you can. He's not ready to live on his own. It's crazy that you are sitting there hungry to pay the bills because of him and he's sitting there eating money.", "Dump this joke and move out. \n\nYou can survive easily on your own without his dead weight.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  This is... so wrong.  He's being very selfish here.  You're doing all the sacrificing, and for what?  So he can get a burger?  Might need to rethink if you want this to continue.  Because if you allow it... it will.  And it'll get worse.", "When two people are struggling together, they need to both be pulling in the same direction, or it will be that much more of a struggle. If you're in survival mode and not both pulling in the same direction, it becomes an impossible situation. Your bf needs to wake up or get out.", "NTA and you may need to rethink this relationship. He is very inconsiderate and irresponsible", "Boyfriend can pay 100% of the rent from his paycheck, and you can cover the rest. If he does not like it, you have a hard choice to make. No mater what, NTA! I wish you the best, and also, see if you can find a food bank, as you should NOT be starving yourself considering you are the one that has paid for the roof over your head, I mean, if he were to leave tomorrow, you would still be covering the rent. He is making you starve!", "Your bf is bit delusional thinking 170 can last 4 weeks.  If he still doesn't stick to the budget especially when he is short on income, you really need to evaluate if it's worth going on with someone who doesn't even grasp what you are sacrificing.  Can you move back to your parents for a bit just to save up?? Just you, not your bf.", "Definitely NOT the Ahole", "Sounds like Boyf is really not that great at planning or anticipating (appreciating) consequences\u2026..might be time to reflect on whether that attitude is something you are willing to tolerate. NTA", "NTA- please just get out of this relationship. He\u2019s perfectly okay with you starving, literally starving, because he\u2019s too lazy to cook food at home? \nReally think about that. Because of HIS demotion, you\u2019re both struggling, you\u2019re starving and he\u2019s\u2026 ordering takeout. \n\nHe\u2019s not worthy of you.", "NTA\n\nI've been in your shoes and it sucks ass.  Having a partner who doesn't seem to care makes it even worse.  You guys need to seriously sit down and have a discussion about your finances and how you guys can lower your bills.  The biggest expense seems to be your rent.  Finding a cheaper place to live might be in your best interests.  If you can't, I know it's a rediculously shitty though, but student loans can be placed into forbearance so that you don't have to pay them.  That sucks because they'll still gather interest during the period.  But if it's either that or starving, I'd rather have the debt.  I hope you guys can figure this out and come to an agreement that works.", "I'm wondering why he cannot do an extra gig to cover his side of the expenses?\nHis student loans are not your to worry.\nSit down with him and decide on a fixed money you would both put into house expenses.\nIf he diesn't have it, he can ask his parents for help.\n\nI'm all for: our money, but if \"our money\" means I get to starve because he needs to chill out, then no thanks.\n\nYou should also meal prep for work. A pasta with oil, salt and pepper and a couple of boiked eggs don't cost so much. No need to starve.\n\nSet your priorities straight. Talk with him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You need to sit down and have a conversation with him about having some foresight. Don\u2019t be afraid of the characterization of the \u201ccontrolling girlfriend\u201d either. You\u2019re supporting him right now because he was irresponsible with his time and planning. It seems nothing has changed. If you\u2019re paying for almost everything, all shared expenses, where is the rest of the 40% of his salary going that you\u2019re now food insecure? Is this relationship worth hauling dead weight and starving yourself when he can\u2019t even think two steps ahead of himself?", "NTA. OP, you're going to have to leave this guy to be able to get by. His inability to hit deadlines is what got you in this position in the first place and now he's prioritizing his desire to eat takeout while you drink coffee all day just to be able to stay afloat. This is not a partner and he's going to pull you down with him if you stay.", "NTA If you are asking for money from family, and he is buying takeout, time for counseling or rethink your situation.  You are supporting him and going hungry.  Either he makes up the difference by getting a 2nd job or leave", "NTA \nYour boyfriend needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into reality. Which means fairly splitting your household expenses, because right now he isn't pulling his weight and isn't even willing to budget to get the two of you through the month.\n\nYou shouldn't be paying almost everything and then having to go hungry while he spends what little food budget you have for the month on take out food for himself.", "NTA all I have for you is sympathy and I hope things will get better soon. Hopefully you two can talk and you can explain to him in a way where he truly understands how dire it is.", "NTA \n\nWhy are you sticking with this guy? You're literally his meal ticket right now and he doesn't care about the budget or your needs.\n\nI urge you to walk away from this asap.", "NTA \n\nAnd you may want to rethink this relationship. His demotion for missing deadlines and not sticking to the budget sounds like he is really unreliable and immature. You sound like you could make it on your own or with a roommate. You deserve so much better than him", "NTA. So your boyfriend is literally stealing food out of your mouth and you feel guilty about it?   \nSounds like he\u2019s manipulating you a lot. Would you also feel guilty and controlling if you told him not to kick puppies?", "NTA but you should really consider if you would be better off losing the bf lol.\n\nIt seems like you're the only one stressed out about money because you're paying the lion's share (or all) of your shared expenses. \n\nSorry, not impressed by the bf.", "NTA (1) Where were you living before you moved in together?\n(2) Were you financially making it when you were apart?\n(3) How long is your lease?\n \nI don't think you get demoted after one missed deadline. Wonder if he knew it was coming because you know he would have had warnings. So did he sign a lease with you and bind your finances together knowing he would need help to survive?\n\nAlso, do you want to continue with this relationship with this guy? If not what are the penalties for breaking your lease? Do your parents know the full truth of your struggle? Can you live with them till you get yourself sorted?", "NTA.  Your boyfriend needs to get on the financial train and stop wasting money that isn't there.", "So, he got demoted for cause, is relying on you financially and doesn\u2019t know how to live within a budget. He doesn\u2019t really sound like a keeper imho.", "NTA. Some of the math is not mathing here, and you should strongly consider separating your finances from your boyfriend\u2019s.", "NTA AT ALL! Immediately split the money, take your half and use it wisely, he can blow his on takeout and figure out the rest later. You\u2019re starving yourself to make it last, he\u2019s literally taking food out of your mouth on a whim because he\u2019s lazy & impatient, which is why he got demoted in the first place.", "NTA. Get out.", "NTA.  But there are many red flags here. First, your boyfriend got demoted for missing deadlines.  So, he wasn't producing at work, and his work and his salary were impacted by that.  Second, he seems in denial about the financial situation that he put you both in, and to the sacrifices you're making for you both as a couple.  He doesn't seem bothered by how things are, or worried or even embarrassed.   I see a lot of heavy lifting here OP, and it's all being done by you.  What does BF bring to your relationship other than stress and financial ruin?", "Nta but you two definitely need to sit down and talk about this financial situation. My wife and I cooked at home for years, we also didn't have a dishwasher so doing both cooking and dishes by hand it burnt us out really bad until eventually we found ourselves eating out even though we knew we couldn't afford it and we had food at home that spoiled because of this. We've calmed down and gotten past this but it definitely put a huge unnecessary financial strain on us, especially my wife. Also I'll agree with a lot of people it sounds like your bf isn't prioritizing. If I knew for a fact that I could make ten dollars last us a week I'd do that over some chow mein. Also if my wife didn't get anything special like candy while I got a coffee, she hates coffee and tea and only drinks hot chocolate when it's freezing outside, then I wouldn't get anything cuz it's not fair. If this is how this relationship is going to be then you definitely need to take a step back and reevaluate it. Either way best of luck to you both", "NTA. It should be easy to understand: 170 Dollars for 4 weeks. That excludes take-out. Period. Your boyfriend is an idiot.", "I guess he won't be eating for the rest of the month.  If he can't budget properly, you have more problems on your hand...he's draining you mentally and financially.  NTA", "This guy does not sound like good life partner material. You are not the a******.", "Please take care of yourself. This whole situation sounds awful.\nNTA.", "NTA. Your bf needs to get a second job so he can start contributing more", "NTA - but he is. When someone shows you who they are, listen. Sounds like he isn\u2019t responsible at work or at home and doesn\u2019t respect your input or feelings. Red flags everywhere. Run\u2026", "NTA. I know that this was a one time thing, but if your boyfriend keeps this up, this is gunna turn into years of living paycheck to paycheck and asking others to help. If you don\u2019t have food to cover your bills and literal food there\u2019s no reason to eat out. I remember the days when I only had 20 bucks in my account so I had to live off Mac and cheese, ramen, rice, beans for a couple months at a time.", "NTA\n\nYou all need to reexamine your budget agreement and if he still can't see the dire situation that you all are currently in, he needs to find other living arrangements.\n\nYour health both mental and physical are at stake.", "[removed]", "The arsehole is the economic system.", "42.50? Only ramen? You can buy 7 lbs of 93/7 ground beef for 35 bucks where I am from. Get yourself some eggs and noodles. Now you got two 1/4  a day or spaghetti and meat. You can get tamato sauce under a $1. I honestly would go with bread and have a breakfast burger w/egg and a burger for dinner every day.", "$42.50/week can buy you some decent food but it absolutely does not allow for extras or takeout.\n\nI could buy pasta, rice, potatoes, frozen veggies, beans, etc etc with that amount - enough to eat good tasting nutritious meals for the week - but there is zero wiggle room and the boyfriend sucks.", "Also if OPs bf is in school still, universities often have a free store where they could get some pantry food from. That isn't always available but hopefully you will be able to find something to make this work and de stress a bit.", "Something has to be off with their budget here.  Two educated employeed people sharing a place with no kids shouldn\u2019t have this much trouble paying the bills.", ">Your partner is not being unreasonable for wanting one take away in however many months - what on earth is the point in life if you can't hav\n\nHe wouldn't be ta if he just wanted it, but he's 100% TA for ordering it when they have less than $150 to feed the both of them for a month. I've been that poor before, and as much as it sucks, sometimes you have to go without luxuries like takeout to make sure you have enough money for food *at all* next week, and BF isn't just making that choice for himself.

Some of us are screwed if we took out loans before the laws changed", "Totally fair, I agree. The boyfriend is absolutely TA and OP really should be nagging him about spending money on takeaway they can't afford. Even the at-home mac n' cheese was presented as a valid option.", "Ugh. I am so sorry. Loans got so predatory that there are many people in your position.
