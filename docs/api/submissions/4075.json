You're paying for everything, what is he bringing to the table, other than covering his own bills and stressing you out?\n\nHe got demoted for missing deadlines and it is seriously affecting your household.  Has he looked for a better job?  Has he looked for a second job?  If he wants to live as you were before, doing things like ordering take out, he needs to bring in more money, and a lot of people pick up a part time gig to do that.  If he's not willing to step up and be a responsible partner, you made need to make some tough decisions about this relationship.", "WTF - you are supporting him and he is supporting himself?\n\nWhat are you doing tied to this child?\n\nRUN, RUN FASTER JUST RUN", "NTA, the only reason you\u2019re in this situation is because he fucked up at work. And after all that he still can\u2019t be responsible with the money you have. Why are YOU making all the sacrifices to make up HIS slack?\n\nIs this long term partner material? Someone you can rely on?", ">I'll use 90% of my salary for our rent, utilities, gas and my student loans. Boyfriend will use 60% of his salary for his own loans and study fees.\n\nINFO: Is this dude not paying rent?", "NTA. You realize you're supporting him right? You're paying most of the bills and he's spending money on food just for himself. Please examine your situation and adjust you guys financial contributions.", "NTA. Keep in mind that the number one reason for divorce in multiple countries is financial issues. I would think long and hard about continuing this relationship since it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re on the same page", "NTA\u2026 but you really need to reconsider if you want to be in a relationship with someone that does not hold the same value for money that you do. Believe me when I say that money is one the biggest issues in married couples and it never ends well", "NTA !!! U are hungry at work getting by coffee, and he just blows your last money on takeaway. Sit him down face to face, and explain the food budget problem. He NEEDS to be controlled. You MUST control all the money now and every purchase. If he can't follow a budget, you need to take his card and take over his account. He must accept being controlled financially since he brought u both in this situation, and u cannot be starving at work.\n\nThere's a lot of great Cooking on a budget tutorials on YT it's always about buying cheap stuff in bulk once a week like potatoes, rice, pasta, lentils, legumes, canned stuff, vegetable sauces etc then cooking up a storm of different meals for a whole week and freezing them in tupperware (so that u have a proper lunch every day at work and he can always heat something up if he works from home). Hell, even buying frozen ready dinners all week like stirfries or chillis or gulash is so much cheaper and healthier than takeaway.\n\nAlso has he been tested for ADHD or executive dysfunction? If he misses deadlines at work like that and needs to be controlled for every purchase, maybe he has a bigger problem than just being dumb and not knowing how to adult..Wishing you the best and hoping he can learn to follow a budget.", "NTA\n\nI was you three months ago. BF went on disability but didn\u2019t fill out the paperwork to actually receive disability payments. Late on rent, worried about how we were going to feed our pets and relying on food at work to get me through. I couldn\u2019t sleep due to the anxiety from not having money. What did I do? I broke up with him. Our financial stability was less important than takeout to him even though he knew how stressed I was. I am happier now than I ever was with him. I\u2019ve recovered financially, I\u2019m doing better at work, even my dog is happier because I have money to spoil him now. Let go of the dead weight and focus on yourself.", "Nta", "I also wonder how it came to the demotion. You don't get this for just one missed deadlined. He must missed several. He ssems like the guy \"i don't care\" and who does whatever he wants without thinking about consequences. Like he is hungry, so he orders take-out. He doesn't give it a second thought about money? His behaviour seems so immature and selfish. He doesn't care that his action also affects OP.", "Agreed", "Beans, lentils, rice, carrots, cucumbers, and things like this are usually very affordable. Don't need to succumb to the ramen /s.", "42.50 a week doesn't have to be Ramen, a low sustenance poor value for your money \"food\". Ramen? That's ridiculous.  42.50 can also be big bags of rice, beans, lentils, quinoa, cous cous, potatoes and carrots.  It can be used to buy a lot of flour, salt and yeast to make bread, using tap water which is free. With basic cheap ingredients you can make tons of things.  Food education is seriously lacking here.", "Yes I agree, try a local church. I work at a church and we give out food cards to those in need in the community.", "Who said he wasn't working? He was demoted, i.e., he still works at the same place he used to, but is getting paid less than he was.", "Dude is taking food out of OP's mouth and you're going to call her controlling?  Come on.  It's hardly \"anal-retentive\" to not want to starve because you ran out of money.", "They\u2019re \u2018splitting finances\u2019 by him contributing towards his own personal expenses, and OP paying for both of them so they have somewhere to live and have warm water. OP\u2019s boyfriend can start thinking about takeout when he starts paying towards the rent.", ">90% of yours on big bills, 60% of his...  does he feel like the other 40% is \"his money\" to do with as he wills?\n\nMy interpretation of that, in conjunction with \"The rest will go for groceries,\" was that his other 40% and her other 10% are supposed to go to groceries, but I admit I am also curious.", "I was also wondering why he only pays 60%. Unless the remaining 40 is for food? Seems to me there's a more equitable split.", "Even just a container of rice!\n\nI may or may not have had a can of Vienna sausages for breakfast...", "That's not what a relationship is, that's not a partnership. Do that and you might as well call it quits.", "There are also videos on YouTube that help with your limited food budget on what you should be purchasing.  It's helped me on occasions.   Also try the food pantries.  \n\nNTA  It WILL get better, just hang in there, both of you.", "If that is actually what it said I Seriously need the coffee I am about to drink.", "I thought about that too, but then the other line about only having $170 for the month... that can't be 10% of her income and 40% of his..\n\nThere are certainly a lot of questions here.  The only certain thing is that buying takeout is irresponsible at best.", "BF\u2019s 60% goes to his personal debt, not the household. \n\nOP this guy needs to start contributing to rent. Doesn\u2019t have to be 50/50. You are taking care of his needs and he\u2019s taking care of his needs. You are being taken advantage of in this setup. \n\nPlease remember that you\u2019re struggling because he was irresponsible at work, he can seek other/additional work instead of you paying for most expenses. NTA but bf is a massive entitled AH", " I work at a church and we give out food cards to those in need in the community.", "How? I still have 5+ years left.", "With the transfer of Great Lakes to Nelnet, I'm not certain how things are shaking up currently with regards to transferring loans to them, specifically. But the direct loan consolidation offered by the federal govt lets you choose the servicer for your consolidated loans, and you can select however many loans you want to consolidate.\n\nGreat Lakes still has the information page available [here](https://mygreatlakes.org/educate/consolidation/apply.html)\n\nEdit for clarity, basically what I did was select only my Navient loan for consolidation, and selected Great Lakes as the servicer (because they service all my other fed loans, as well, and have been the least shitty loan servicer I've ever worked with, lol). Great Lakes took over the loan, and I no longer had to pay monthly on it."]}
