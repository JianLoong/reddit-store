You are not controlling, he screwed up. There are no nicer words for it. He got demoted, putting you both in this position. He needs to understand that actions have consequences.

If he wants a treat he can pay for it himself AFTER he's covered the important bills. He needs to contribute equally and if he can't afford to he needs to get more hours or get a new job.

The fact that you're struggling financially is a direct result of him performing poorly at work. He should be doing everything he can to rectify this issue, not making it worse.

Anyone who would put you in that kind of distress is not the one you should be spending your life with. Where would he be without you to help regulate his spending? You deserve a lot better. Also, please do not rely on office coffee to keep your hunger at bay. A 26-year-old woman needs fuel to get through the workday. Please consider visiting local food banks or applying for government assistance. Hunger can make you more emotional and can affect your decision-making abilities.", "Nta.
