Your vision is good his isn\u2019t. NTA.", "NTA\nYou two definitely need to have a chat about finances because either your bf is completely unaware how tight things really are (and thay you aren't even eating at work), he's hoping your parents will keep bailing you out whenever ye need ot or he has secret money he's keeping from you and doesn't feel he has anything to worry about. This is an unacceptable situation and you shouldn't be going without good while he orders take aways. I would be considering a move back in with your parents if that's possible, or finding cheaper/ more shared accommodation as this is not a sustainable.", "NTA. Your bf is a dud.", "NTA. Break up with this deadbeat wtf.", "NTA. Find a food bank. Don\u2019t be shy. Please don\u2019t be hungry as you may not do your own work properly. If your parents can afford to help, let them help you. Maybe move back home?  Get side hustles? My son does tiny basic jobs online - like format an Xcel worksheet for someone and can get paid $20 for 15 minutes work. Sell some stuff online. Get a roommate or start dog sitting/walking. Make the budgeting/hustling a game you play together. My hubby works coupons until my eyes roll. You are young. You are a team. Things will get better.  Let\u2019s go!", "NTA. You're in survival mode and that AH boyfriend of yours doesn't give two shits about the very serious predicament you're in (one he apparently got you two in due to negligence to meet his job's deadlines).\n\nI would seriously consider making him pay more out of pocket. There is no reason for him to have that much leftover to spend on takeout when cooking could be cheaper. I would really reconsider the relationship with someone who is okay letting you go without as long as they're full.", "NTA. You don't have a budget problem you have a boyfriend problem. He is irresponsible and not a good partner. \n\nDump him. Move back in with your parents if needed until you can find a place you can afford on your own. But wake up and smell the manure. He's not worth sticking around for.\n\n28 and he can't stick to deadlines enough to avoid demotion? Can't stick to a budget of such meager money that any takeout will lead to starvation? He ain't the one hun.\n\nDump him and dump him now.", "YTA To yourself.\n\nYour BF screwed up. Seriously. He got demoted because he missed deadlines. He literally failed to do his work on the expected timeline. But he had you to fall back on.\n\nHonestly, if I think you guys need to shift finances around. Maybe the answer is he covers at least as much of the rent as his salary with cover after his loans payments. Maybe the answer is- you are both responsible 50/50 and he has to get a second job. \n\nMaybe the answer is that he has to figure out how to make up some of the difference in your paychecks- he makes the trips to the food pantry, he starts looking for a less expensive apartment for the two of you, he finds a second job. Heck, he needs to ask his family for money. (Why should you be the only one having to go hat in hand to your family?)\n\nBut you also need to be honest with him. Sit him down and make it clear that we have $150ish now to get thru 4 weeks. That is approximately $5 day for food for the two of us and that when he called to say that he was going to spend $20 on food, you were hungry at work because the two of you can't afford food.\n\nAnd part of that is the two of you having an honest budget discussion. Setting a budget for the month. This is what we have to spend each week. Maybe acknowledging that you need to shift to a cash budget. \n\nFor the week- we have these jars of money to spend. This jar with $35 is all the money we have for food for the week. If we take money out of it- you will see the money leaving. And you have to put in a receipt to show how every penny is spent. So neither of you can just spend money.", "ESH. You\u2019re being a bit controlling considering y\u2019all split finances, AND your boyfriend sounds like an idiot. You guys both really need to have a talk with someone smarter and more emotionally distanced from y\u2019all\u2019s situation. Boyfriend needs to hear just how stupid he is (from someone who doesn\u2019t love him), and you need to hear how anal-retentive you sound (also from someone who doesn\u2019t love you.)", "I think op you need to have a talk with your boyfriend  cause it doesn't seem  you are on the same page : you try to get food home an cook and he apparently  orders take out with little  care while you are starving yourself. \n\nIf that's  the case  the he  needs  to get another job as it's  HIS SALARY that was cut. If he continues  like this then either break up  or he needs a second  job as your 50% is covered  from your salary.\n\n\nOr he agrees that the rules apply to both and both take food cooked  home/sandwiches at work  and eat   home no takeout. \n\nIt s  as simple as that. \n\nDO NOT MAKE YOURSELF SICK BY NOT EATING OP.\n\n\nYou will have difficulties  doing your job among other things.\nChange your home to a more affordable one if necessary  (always assuming  bf puts the SAME effort  in saving as you do).\n\nNta  he is in this case. You need to have a serious discussion  with him  NOW .\n\nEta even if you take  toastbread =butter toast with butter  and eat pasta at home it's  still better than no meal. I suggest  this as here the 20-30 slices of butter toast cost about  1-1,30 and butter 2 and can cover you for a week  or so. Get a package of cheese (feta 1,60) and sprinkle a bit over the butter  to change the taste a bit  so you don't  get bored. See the offers of ready meals frozen and buy a few the 2 can eat for about 3 etc. Hope this helps.  All the best", "I love that you called the OP love.\n\nMy heart breaks for you. You cannot take the situation seriously and allow your BF come along and torpedo everything. There's lots of advice on this post, which includes deferring your loans until January (Thanks, u/JadedSlayer\\`) and/or jettisoning your BF (thanks u/Manager-Limp). Please read through everything and decide the best course of action. \n\nBut PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, do not sit at work hungry.

My husband lived on rice, pasta and dried beans for a good while before we got together. Definitely not healthy and he lost a lot of weight, but he was too proud to ask for help then.
