Red flag on GFs part though - I get having feelings hurt, but once you explained she should\u2019ve backed off.", "NTA. And I think your girlfriend's behaviour is very inconsiderate.\n\nDon't budge on this. Do not feel pressurised into letting your GF spend time with your daughter. If your GF cannot understand this then she clearly isn't the right one for you.", "There is actually research on eyerolling.

Ok I\u2019ve met your kid now you can move me into your house?  You should put the brakes on hard with anyone that doesn\u2019t take your lead on your kid.  Keep standing up for yourself.

The eyeroll and dismissive attitude are a huge red flag.", "NTA.\n\nGreat job here, dad.\n\nThe reason why it's always recommended that parents wait before introducing their children to new people are for the following reasons:\n\n1. Making sure the relationship is going to stick. Don't bring your child around a myriad of 'girlfriends'. If you're not seeing a future with this person, your kid doesn't need to meet them. Keep that under wraps.\n2. Kids get attached easily, so making sure that the relationship is going to stick is paramount before you introduce them.\n3. You having the time to gauge whether the person you're with is mature and genuine enough to understand that the kid will always come first because you are the only parent they have to rely on.\n4. To give you time to acclimate to the new person's ways. I think you need to see someone in all four seasons (or at least a year) and in a myriad of circumstances for you to adequately assess whether this person's character is one that you want around your child.\n5. You should want to make sure the relationship is a healthy one for you and your daughter, by extension. You are going to be your daughter's best example of how a healthy relationship functions and you need time on the books with the person to understand if the relationship is healthy or not.\n\nOP, you say that you started dating this person 'in the spring'. By my estimation, spring starts March/April. Summer has just started, so we're talking less than 6 months here. When the conversation is brought up, this girlfriend is basically demanding to meet her now when the two of you haven't even achieved one item on this list.

You don't have to introduce anyone to your daughter until you're (both you and daughter) ready. There's a lot of research on when to introduce partners to children and that also takes into account the age of the child.

This whole situation sounds young. Absolutely protect your kid dad.", "NTA - I dated for a year+, multiple women, after my separation and through my divorce with my daughter's mom.

My daughter doesn't remember a time without her in her life.

Not all but most. \n\nI would sit her down and explain that introducing your child to every random person in your life is not good for the child's stability and it is you being a good parent.

We grew up knowing our parents have friends, what's the big deal with it nowadays? Why exclude your potential partner? What's one more adult? Are your kids Hogwarts hopefuls and read minds so they'll magically know it's your possible partner? Do they try to fit any adult in your life as a parental figure? Going to a park with your kids and your adult friends to keep you company while they play does not and should not automatically mean to your kids they should attach to a random person as a parental figure.

Not that she has revealed herself, believe her.", "It\u2019s completely normal to wait at least 6 months, but it\u2019s a very individual decision and not one to be taken lightly. And Father\u2019s Day would have been a terrible idea. That\u2019s a special day for just the two of you and likely will be for a long time. The introduction should be much more casual than that.\n\nAnd I second the people who are pointing out that eye-rolling is a terrible reaction to any boundary in a relationship.", "It is also rude that yiur GF thought taking over Father's day w/ your daughter was the time to do it.\n\nAs a child of divirce and someone who dated divorced people w/ children: don't introduce your kid to your GF early on and after you do, make sure you still have 1:1 time w/ your kid.\n\nAnyone that presses you to meet the child too quickly is either pressing for commitment or is jealous of you kid. Either way, they don't have your kid's best interest in mind.", "People keep saying 6 months, but a year is ok too. Especially at your age, the women you will be dating will be less mature than you because you had to grow up fast. Many of them will want to play house, you need to wait and observe for a while to make sure they respect your boundaries, are responsible themselves, and don\u2019t play games.", "You're doing things right!  Seriously.  You're right, kids that(and for many years) age bond fast and have no understanding of the complexity of adult relationships.", "Oh cringe, definitely not introducing my kid to anyone after just 3 months.", "100%, still in the honeymoon phase of a relationship"]}
