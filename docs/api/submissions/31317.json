I ended up with the name Dorothy Lark but I never liked Dorothy or any of the nicknames so I have been Lark or since I was in kindy.

Emily is a little too timeless for her over the really old school style.\n\nI do think my history with my original name is playing a role with this. My sister knows I do not like old fashioned names. We used to bicker about it over the years because she'd say I was lucky to have my old name and I would tell her I didn't like old fashioned names.\n\nMy sister was really pushing for me to give Ethel's name all the praise and then the topic kind of turned from that to I should really learn to appreciate old fashioned names and has two years of legally having a weird name not made me realize I was lucky to be born with the name I was given. It built up over time because she ignored me when I asked her to drop it so I lost my temper around Halloween when my family travelled out to see me. My sister brought it up three times that first day and the second time on the second day I snapped and told her she cannot make me like old fashioned names so just drop the fucking topic and name her kids what she wants and leave me alone.\n\nMy sister went on a little rant about me being rude and hurtful and how my hatred for old fashioned names will hurt all her kids because they will all have older names.

NTA given your history with your own name. \n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with old fashion names personally. So long as a parent picks a name their child can comfortably live with for the first few years of their life, that's the important thing. Then when the child is old enough, they should get to change it if they so desire. \n\nBest suggestion I have if your sister keeps poking this bear, is to treat the name like a gifted shirt. \n\nShirts can look nice and fit very well for some time. Sometimes they grow INTO one. But most of the time, people grow out of a shirt, and that's okay. And you can always change the shirt out later if it doesn't fit right for whatever reason. Maybe it's too small. Too big. Reminds you of an ex you can't stand. A band you've fallen out of love with. The fabric is no longer comfortable. There's many reasons to change a shirt. \n\nAnd sometimes a shirt can be repurposed. Shirt for a band you adore but it's too small to wear anymore? Frame it and hang it on the wall. Shirt gets stained but still pretty decent shape? Housework shirt. Shirt gets a hole in an odd place that can't be repaired? Turn the shirt into a pillow. \n\nNames should be treated like gifted shirts. You can wear a name forever because you grew into it and love it, or you can change it out when it no longer fits. You can repurpose a name you had for something new (like a pet or pokemon or gifting your dead name to someone who would wear it proudly). \n\nIf your sister keeps insisting on you complimenting the names, just settle on a neutral compliment like you would if someone asks if their shirt looks nice on them, then walk away. \n\nYou don't need the added stress.", "NTA, your sister is trying very hard to gaslight you about your name vs the (terrible) name she gave her kid.
