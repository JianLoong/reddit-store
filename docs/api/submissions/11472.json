She said she was hungry and suggested we go out to eat. I said I was done driving for the day, but I have plenty of food in the house. She looked in my fridge and said \"You don't have any food. Let's go out to eat.\"\n\nI told her she was welcome to go out to eat, but I was staying home because I was tired. I had to go straight from work to the airport to pick her up, and I was done for the day. She said \"but you don't have any food.\" I said I have pasta, rice, veggies, shrimp, tofu, french fries and all kinds of stuff. I have a ton of food and can make dinner.\n\nShe said all that has to be cooked and she's too hungry to wait. I said the food at restaurants also has to be cooked, and also I have yogurt, applesauce, hummus and salsa if she needs a snack. She said that wasn't food because it's cold. I told her she can borrow my car and go where she likes, but don't say there's no food, because there is. She said she wasn't going to go by herself, so I said fine, I'll make dinner.\n\nShe complained that she was hungry and suggested we order takeout because there was no food. I overreacted a little and said \"quit being a fucking liar. There is food. You don't want it, but it is here. If you want takeout, order it.\"\n\nShe accused me of gaslighting her and said condiments aren't food. I said I was done talking to her for the night. I said I would make her a plate and she could eat it or not and if she doesn't want it to put a cover over it and put it in the fridge, but don't talk to me the rest of the night. I ate in my room. When I went out to clean the kitchen she had left her plate on the counter where it would have spoiled overnight.\n\nI woke her up and asked her why she did that, and she said it was because I called her a liar and cursed at her. I called our mom and said to get her a hotel room because I changed my mind about her staying with me. I dropped my sister off at the hotel and she flipped me off. I feel bad because I'm supposed to be an example to her and shouldn't have cursed at her. Maybe I overreacted because I was tired and my actions caused everything to snowball out of control.", "created_utc": 1677945396, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i2q97/aita_for_calling_my_sister_an_expletive_liar/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was going to say you kinda suck for cursing at her, but if she\u2019s old enough to stay at a hotel alone then she can handle that. But your sister\u2026 wow. Cold food is still food. Pasta, shrimp, French fries, those aren\u2019t condiments. And she\u2019s just soooo hungry but then goes to bed without eating because you didn\u2019t do what she wanted. She deserves the cursing for misuse of gaslighting. It isn\u2019t gaslighting if you state the truth and someone doesn\u2019t want to hear it. You had food! It was truth!

She purposefully put your mother out to make you feel bad and want to cave by burdening someone else. Hence the hotel room.

Be an example by not enabling terrible behavior as you are doing.", "INFO: How old is your sister?", "NTA. \n\nIs she a literal child?", "NTA.  And all of those suggestions sounded delicious!

I hope she recognises them.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA Your sister sounds spoiled and entitled. All kinds of food in your house and it's not good enough for her?

Btw, shrimp is my favorite condiment.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a major AH here.  She could just have said \"I really want take out tonight\" and been done with it.  Instead, she lied and argued with you about the food you had available and then accused **you** of gaslighting her, to try to get her way.\n\nIf your sister is an adult, she should know how to **communicate** like one.  Not try to be manipulative and lie to get her way.\n\nYou did the right thing dropping your sister off at a hotel.

That's worse if she's very young, but I don't need to actually ask ages, because it sucks no matter what.\n\nShe's obviously an AH, and you were correct that she was lying. But (even though she's your sister and crashing with you), at that point you needed to not take responsibility for her. She could eat or not, order takeout for herself or not, and that's it. You even offered to let her drive herself to a restaurant, ffs.\n\nYou were an AH mostly to your mom.\n\nHowever, don't pick your sister up from the airport anymore or let her stay with you, as she's apparently an ungrateful brat.", "CLICK BAIT DON'T COMMENT", "Proud of you OP.

As the host it is your responsibility to make your guest comfortable. That means providing a meal, or takeout, or going to a restaurant.  Asking her to cook for herself was not acceptable.

It can be one or the other depending on how it is used. \n\nIn Turkey yogurt is incorporated in almost all meals and is used mostly as a condiment (aka yogurt is added to or in dips, doughs, drinks, spreads, etc...) Also Greek yogurt can be a replacement for sour cream without much difference and I consider sour cream a condiment. \n\nMost of the stuff wasn\u2019t condiments though.", "Welcome Home Sis"]}
