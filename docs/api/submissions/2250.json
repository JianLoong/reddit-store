My husband has one childhood friend that was coming from out of state to attend. I\u2019ve met him a bunch but only his girlfriend of three years a few times because of the distance. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy. \n\nFlash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him. \n\nI was pissed since I made an exception for him and I didn\u2019t want anyone random at my wedding. I had one of my bridesmaid go to him and tell him he could stay but can his date please go back to the hotel this is a private event. \n\nHe said ok and didn\u2019t make a fuss but he left with her and didn\u2019t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night. \n\nMy husband found out about it the next day and we got in an argument. He\u2019s mad because his friend traveled and I kick him out without talking to him. I didn\u2019t kick him out just his date. \n\nNow it\u2019s a few weeks later my husband still brings it up from time to time and his friend hasn\u2019t been answering his texts.

Sure, but the post also doesn't specify whether or not he knew you were restricting the +1s so it's possible he didn't even know you were wanting to limit the number of people in attendance to just people you knew. Even if he did know you were limiting +1s, at the end of the day you gave him one and he used it.

My husband has one childhood friend that was coming from out of state to attend. I\u2019ve met him a bunch but only his girlfriend of three years a few times because of the distance. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy. \n\nFlash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him. \n\nI was pissed since I made an exception for him and I didn\u2019t want anyone random at my wedding. I had one of my bridesmaid go to him and tell him he could stay but can his date please go back to the hotel this is a private event. \n\nHe said ok and didn\u2019t make a fuss but he left with her and didn\u2019t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night. \n\nMy husband found out about it the next day and we got in an argument. He\u2019s mad because his friend traveled and I kick him out without talking to him. I didn\u2019t kick him out just his date. \n\nNow it\u2019s a few weeks later my husband still brings it up from time to time and his friend hasn\u2019t been answering his texts. I kind of feel bad but it was my wedding and I didn\u2019t want any strangers there.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why create drama? Why?", "YTA", "Why are you so controlling? God help that poor man. Yes it was your wedding but it was his too. That was his best friend and he's trying to make it a pleasant day for everyone that he invited. You had to go full bridezilla and I will not be surprised if within 5 years y'all are divorced. Rule number one in life is don't sweat the small s***. Rule number two? Everything is small s***. \n\n\nYou had one person show up to your wedding that you didn't personally invite but honestly, I admire the guy for doing what he did because if I invited someone to my wedding and I paid for them to eat at the reception and they didn't show up, I'd be kind of pissed.

No ring, no bring is such a ridiculously stupid rule, especially when it comes to long term couples. Then you went to the effort to remove someone from your wedding who had traveled there.

FIRST. A GF of 3 years should not be listed on an invite as \u201cand guest\u201d aka +1, that\u2019s offensive and rude. She should be addressed by name on the envelope. If a named guest cannot attend then they/the other invitee should revise the RSVP and ask the couple how to handle. However it sounds like the guy might\u2019ve asked the groom and the groom OKed the rando +1 in lieu of the named guest ex-GF. In which case OP is TA. \n\nSECOND. If OP insisted on rudely and offensively addressing a 3 year GF as a +1 rather than by name as etiquette demands, then the named invitee was perfectly within his rights to invite any rando because that\u2019s literally what the invite says. \n\nSo either way YTA OP.", "This marriage will not last.\n\nMajor YTA what kind of person are you?", "OP is the kind of person that no one actually likes, but they have some reason they have to put up with her.

While directly talking to her husband about it, she didn't tell him \"I'm going to ask her to leave, because I don't know her.\" It was more effort for her to avoid telling the husband, then to give him the heads up.

Yes I met the love of my life but their thoughtfulness toward people travelling alone, feeling anxious etc means other people still rave about that wedding as excellent hospitality.\n\nI have had to decline multiple weddings before out of town with no plus one while single because I\u2019m disabled and often I simply cannot travel without help to lift a case, drive (medically barred) or help me through the day. Weddings are often exhausting, inaccessible and never have enough seats. Having someone who can go get drinks while I sit etc is often the difference between attending safely or not at all. It always so embarrassing having to ask if I could have someone pick me up or drop me off because I was disabled and thus the couple debate if plus ones were valid as carers or just couple privilege. I used to point out their elderly relatives might find it helpful too and people tend to self regulate but nope, not once did a couple budge on it. They still expected a gift for my declining the invite though\u2026\n\nThere are many reasons plus ones can be important beyond just couples and while budgets and preferences play a part, hosts should think more broadly.
