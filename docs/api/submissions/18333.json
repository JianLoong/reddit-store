I\u2019ve been to many interfaith weddings where most Hindu-Americans and the non-Hindus don\u2019t understand Sanskrit so the priest translates what they\u2019re doing. The non-Hindu family has never had an issue with it. I agree with your husband, it\u2019s suspicious that they\u2019re objecting to hearing Hebrew because why would they care unless they\u2019re anti-Semitic? They\u2019re trying to erase an important cultural element from your brother\u2019s wedding that he\u2019s specified is important to him. I think he needs to have some convos with his fianc\u00e9e about her family but there isn\u2019t much else you can do about it now that you\u2019ve already shared your opinion.", "NTA, it's part of a tradition, so for them to disregard it kind of voids the full tradition. Though maybe they don't get that ketubah being read aloud is such an integral part of the wedding, and technically without it being read the marriage isn't valid, as having a prenup being read aloud is, as far as I know, a uniquely Jewish tradition.", "NTA.  There are some parts of a Catholic service still said in Latin.", "NTA taking an important element out of the ceremony, specifically one that was important to including the groom's culture and relatives in the ceremony on the basis of the bride's family's input, sounds fishy and yes in this case antisemitic.  They are literally paring out the Jewish elements from a wedding with a Jewish groom.", "NTA I\u2019m not a religious person (raised catholic) but if I was marrying someone that upheld their religious traditions even if they are in a language I don\u2019t understand I\u2019d still want to participate because it\u2019s important to them.", "NTA - The fact is that your brother wanted to do this and so did his fianc\u00e9e, it\u2019s just her parents making it into an issue. She and he should be standing their ground on this, but it\u2019s ultimately their choice if they want to kowtow or not.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should push your opinion any further unless he asks for it, but I do think her parents are wrong for trying to change up something about the wedding that they shouldn\u2019t even be involved in. It\u2019s a beautiful tradition, inclusive to the belief and cultures of everyone involved, but her parents are the ones making it exclusionary by making it clear that Hebrew is unwelcome. If your brother and fianc\u00e9e choose to appease those trying to erase part of your brother\u2019s culture, that\u2019s ultimately up to them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA for bringing it up, but I wouldn\u2019t pursue it. Let your brother come to his own conclusions. \n\nAt the very least, they need some instruction in what constitutes a micro-aggression. Since you don\u2019t know them it\u2019s hard to say if they are just ignorant or if they were using the language thing as a cover for something worse. It sucks of them either way, especially his fianc\u00e9e who is putting what her parents want ahead of something so important to her future husband.", "Nta, clearly.", "NTA they are reading it in English so they will know what it means, it\u2019s a stupid request from the in laws", "NAH. Well the in laws are, but neither you or your brother are. You wanted to make sure your brother understood the in laws are discriminatory towards your family. Your brother has a right to say he doesn\u2019t care if the ketubah is read in Hebrew.", "YTA - they aren\u2019t dropping it entirety, just taking out a portion. Seems like the in-laws are being supportive (footing the bill) and fianc\u00e9e onboard for integrating several Jewish traditions. When planning a wedding, plans change. The in-laws may have made the suggestion, but your brother and his fianc\u00e9e made the discussion. For all you know your brother and his fianc\u00e9e could have just wanted to shave time of the reading. You\u2019ve made a big assumption with little to no support.", "YTA. It's not clear that the idea to not read in Hebrew was coming from an anti-Semitic sentiment. This is a situation that needed more communication around the idea of reading the ketubah in both language. No sense going right to the worst case scenario when other the state reasons might be the true ones. \n\nThere's a lot of real anti-Semitism around right now, so it's easy to throw that accusation around. But it doesn't help anyone to make a mountain out of a molehill when a simpler (and less horrifying) reason for the change is more likely.", "Sorry I think YTA. The in laws being concerned about having part of the ceremony in another language is a huge leap to anti-semitism. It's very dangerous to make those types of accusations with so little information about them and their other beliefs. At best you could have advised your brother to try and educate them more in the tradition.", "YTA \n\nSaying they're antisemitic just because they didn't want the speech to be read in both languages is really a bit too much. \n\nYou don't even know the people and are judging them too harshly.", "NTA. Your spouse who chose to marry you felt this. My husband was not Jewish when we married (he decided to join the tribe about 13 yrs later) and his insights and your husband's insights are valid. Maybe more so cause he has to experience the culture without being a member. His perspective very much matters.", "NTA. As a Jewish woman, they\u2019re definitely being antisemitic and your brother needs to consider marrying this woman if his Judaism is important to him.\n\nHe may not be able to raise his kids jewish or keep his traditions if he marries her", "ESH - Your generation in your family is frankly not keeping most Jewish traditions, so at what point is someone no longer a Jew? Traditional Judaism is as much inheritance and culture as it is religion. As US society has moved further away fom religion as a whole, so have the members of your family. You all sound confused about what your actual beliefs are and how you want those reflected in your lives. Religious tenets are not on a buffet line. You don't get to pick and choose which ones to follow while claiming to be part of one's faith. It's all or none. Decide to be a faithful Jew or to not be one at all. The choice is yours. The issue presented is really irrelevant. Neither bride nor groom is a practicing Jew.", "YTA.", "NTA. There are a lot of ppl who act in antisemitic ways without even realising they\u2019re being antisemitic, and that doesn\u2019t change the impact of their behaviour. At best, this is xenophobic re not wanting it to be in a language they don\u2019t speak. \n\nBut if they\u2019d be ok if your brother was Catholic and wanted something read or recited in Latin, then yeah, this behaviour is pretty solidly antisemitic. \n\nI can imagine this is hard for your brother and he may not want to see what is happening. But you\u2019re his sibling and I don\u2019t see telling him the truth as a bad thing, as long as you approached the topic kindly. \n\nBut you\u2019ve told him and now you need to not push it.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation, I think reading the ketubah in both Hebrew and English is so sweet.", "YTA jumping to conclusions and labelling someone anti-semitic is criminal. This could ruin their life and make them the outcast of society. You jumped to the most heinous reason for objecting to something. If you were in the middle ages you would be the one pointing to some innocent woman the she is the witch. I would keep as much distance as possible with people like you. So that I don't have to look over my shoulder every time I say something.", "It's possible they're anti-Semitic but it's also possible they're just xenophobia and would have been upset if part of the ceremony was in Spanish, German, etc.  Some people can't handle people talking in a language they don't understand.", "NTA. But I don\u2019t know if they will view it as \u201canti semetic\u201d and that\u2019s because they are simply viewing it as \u201cnot inclusive\u201d. But like, if they aren\u2019t willing to sit through a small part of a reading that is in Hebrew then what other compromises will they expect of your brother? They may claim to be open minded but when it comes to grandkids will they expect them not to follow any Jewish practices?", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA but I also think Hebrew sounds rhythmic and soothing; it's a beautiful language we're gracious to have today due to families like yours continuing to honor and pass it onward.\n\nIt's antisemitism at worst, it's blatant hatred/ignorance at best.", "NTA. Fellow Jew here. Actually, the ketubah is written and read in Aramaic (biblical first ever language which influenced Hebrew and Arabic languages. I digress... to deny one of the most important Jewish aspects of a wedding is a microaggression and is indeed antisemitic. If your brother and his bride have kids together someday and have a son who has a bar mitzvah, will they also object to the son reading the Torah in Hebrew? Oy vey...", "Especially, if what is being read is not understood by anyone else.", "Being a jew doesn't require practicing Judaism. \n\nThere is no minimum level of observance that one\nmust maintain to be considered Jewish.", "FWIW, as far as our observancies, we practice the same things as we did growing up (kosher, holidays, etc) minus having Jewish partners. People can only convert to Judaism if they believe in the tenets. I can\u2019t speak to my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, but my husband is atheist/agnostic so therefore should not convert. We made a decision pre-marriage to keep a culturally Jewish household with commercial Christmas added in (he practices the same things I do, and our children can make up their own minds).", "You\u2019re wrong.

And the purpose is symbolic--it's not necessary for people to understand the words.\n\nNo one would complain about not understanding the words if they had a singer performing Ave Maria or O Mio Babbino Caro at the ceremony.", "I disagree. The entire issue in this post is that OP's bro is practicing only 1/2 of his religion, and with an atheist no less. It's super hypocritical to incorporate any \"religion\" into this ceremony. What would the purpose be? They've fallen away from religion but desire to maintain their Jewish identity. Similar to how most \"Christians\" today are half-assed. Not wanting to fully be one, but not willing to let it go either. \n\nU.S. Jews do not have a single, uniform answer to what being Jewish means. When asked whether being Jewish is mainly a matter of religion, ancestry, culture or some combination of those things, Jews respond in a wide variety of ways, with just one-in-ten saying it is only a matter of religion. They've lost their roots, and now don't know who the hell they are.", "According to Jewish law, an atheist born to a Jewish mother is still Jewish. Your level of participation doesn\u2019t make or break your standing in the religion. Judaism doesn\u2019t work that way. \n\nOP, my brother married a Christian woman whose family said some pretty antisemitic things to him. They didn\u2019t consider themselves antisemites, of course. I didn\u2019t attend the wedding, and refused to subject myself or my children to whatever was going to come out their mouths that day. NTA.", "Why feel the need to continue this charade? Neither your brother or his fiance' are Jewish! This entire discussion is moronic at this point. ESH", "It's halakhah. OP and her brother are Jewish. \n\nTheir Jewish identity need not have have anything to do with religion. \n\nJudaism is an ethno-religion and Jews comprise a nation One need not practice Judaism to any specific level of observation to be considered Jewish. \n\nYou either are a member of the time, or you are not. \n\nSince OP's mother is Jewish, OP and her brother are Jewish.

You can't change what God has commanded any more than you can change God himself. To OP: I personally don't give a fuck if you're an atheist! I'm very comfortable in my religion and am not the one who posted on Reddit about being confused. Must I remind you, that was you? Get a life. You've wasted enough of my day.", "Bloodline only. That fact has zero to do with OP's posted question. Why don't you put some effort into answering that?", "Uhm, yes, you can. There are currently three \"mainstream\" Judaism branches in US alone, all with different levels of observance, and while yes, somebody who is an Orthodox Jew wouldn't marry an outsider unless they convert, a Reform Jew very well might. And a Reford Rabbi can perform a wedding between a Jew and a non-Jew, while an Orthodox, or even a Conservative Rabbi would put a hard stop to it.", "You sure as shit can pick and choose and everyone does. Everyone.", "Pretty sure anyone outside of ultra Orthodox Judaism isn\u2019t following *all* of G-d\u2019s laws. Some Orthodox married women don\u2019t cover their hair, they wear pants, they don\u2019t have separate beds from their husband. Are they then hacks?\n\nFor me personally, I have found more ties to both my religion and culture by practicing those that mean something to me (evening prayers, cooking certain cultural foods, keeping kosher) than blindly following everything even those I take concern with. If someone else chooses different practices, that\u2019s their decision. My husband and I agreed to raise our kids Jewish (and halachically they are bc of maternal bloodline); we had an Orthodox mohel at my son\u2019s bris and when we asked him pre-birth if that would be an issue that my husband wasn\u2019t Jewish he had no problem with it. \n\nTBH, the black & white thinking around what\u2019s \u201cJewish enough\u201d is what kept me from being more observant than my parents (they grew up orthodox and chose not to live that way, but have some orthodox siblings). My uncle was very close minded and always made us feel lesser than. The Chabad do a much better job at helping people find connection and accepting that we are all Jews. \n\nAnd, 23&me has confirmed that we are 99.5% Ashkenazi Jewish. It is very much an ethnoreligion.", "A bloodline that makes OP and her bother  part of the Jewish people.

But traditionally the ketubah is actually Aramaic, which almost no one speaks or understands. I got married in an orthodox Jewish ceremony and we didn\u2019t have it read aloud because the traditional text is problematic as well (like assigning a monetary value to the bride\u2019s virginity.) so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily wrong or prejudiced to ask that a ketubah isn\u2019t read aloud in a language the audience doesn\u2019t understand.", "They definitely didn\u2019t align with the traditional text, which is why they wrote their own text and then had it translated to Hebrew. Tbh, if he had decided to have a completely secular ceremony, I wouldn\u2019t have bat an eye. I feel bad for him because they put the effort into this, and for months he said it was very important, but now the \u201ccompromise\u201d is reading it in English only by the siblings (apparently they originally asked that it be read in a private pre-ceremony or by officiant). Totally get that if someone\u2019s paying they get a say, but I figured that was for music, favors, food, guest list\u2026 not the ceremony itself."]}
