But a little annoyed is not how she reacted.  Once I returned home from work she came up to me screaming at me for stealing her stuff and not respecting her privacy.

Of course she's angry.\n\n1. You took her property without her permission and didn't even bother to return it.\n2. You don't get to decide how important something is to someone else.  \n3. If you used my toothpaste, I'd never use it again.  No way I want your cooties, that's disgusting.\n\nYou are a GUEST and allowing you to stay is hugely generous of the WHOLE family, including little sis.  Maybe try acting grateful?", "YTA.  So her reaction to you invading her space and using her property without her permission is the issue here, really?!?  The fact that her brother dismissed her feelings is also a red flag.  His permission to using her property was garbage.  I suspect that she\u2019s over both of you!  \ud83d\ude02", "YTA -  you took her toothpast and did not return it.  That is not the way to win friends or positively influence people.", "YTA and so is your boyfriend. You shouldn\u2019t use things that don\u2019t belong to you without asking and your bf had no right telling you to use his sister\u2019s. Also as someone who uses sensitive toothpaste, it is noticeably more expensive and it goes quicker so even if she overreacted she has every right to be mad at you guys.", "Your boyfriend is TA for not apologizing and saying she's overreacting. You are not TA and neither is his sister", "ESH -\n\nPrivacy is a huge thing for teens. They want their boundaries respected and their space to be their own. I would sit down with her and apologize for taking her stuff, I would also discuss with her that you are happy to discuss any issues she has with you but screaming \u201cbitch\u201d is neither productive or respectful. Ask her if there is something else she would like to problem solve with you.\n\nI know certain sensitivity toothpaste is super expensive. The dentist tried to get us to buy a $40 bottle \ud83d\ude44.", "YTA.  Your BF didn't have any right to tell you to 'borrow' his sister's stuff.  (Borrowing requires the owner to be aware and give permission...btw)  And what it sounds like you're describing is Prevident, which is a prescription toothpaste.  Prescription.", "NTA\n\nShe over reacted, but I suspect this has nothing to do with the toothpaste.", "NTA. Wow, what a tantrum! And at age 17! Over toothpaste! \n\nOne would hope that her parents would tell her that's wild and ridiculous behavior and she's only doing a good job of having people see her as a child. But I think it's just a good sign to stay away from her. I would still buy her a tube of her toothbrush to demonstrate that you appreciate the use of it and recognize it was expensive, but also as a lesson to her in how to be graceful and appreciative. Chances are, she'll vent about it to someone who will ask if you replaced it and, if she tells the truth, there's the chance she or her vent buddy will realize that she's being insane. Because either she keeps it or she tosses it or refuses to use it, which makes her look like an even bigger nut job. Either way, you will be able to give an honest recount to anyone who asks that you both apologized and replaced over and above what was used so everyone will know she's a child.", "YTA. Prescription toothpaste is expensive, a hassle to get a hold of, and even more of a hassle to get the prescription refilled.", "Very soft YTA. The sister probably hates having you there and is tired of it, and that was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. The comments about her boundaries and property are a little much over some toothpaste but I get it that it wasn\u2019t yours and you should\u2019ve asked who it belongs to for permission. Regardless of what she says, but her another.", "YTA ask her, it's her toothpaste not your boyfriends i wouldn't have sworn at you but you're completely in her space, in her home, you're a stranger and then you used her stuff she probably feels backed into a corner also if it's prescription toothpaste then that's a lot of money potentially, nobody in that house noticed the regular toothpaste was close to running out really? Just buy a new tube a few days before you think it'll run out, you're an adult, preplan", "NTA.\n\nIf someone calls you a \"bitch\" because you used toothpaste, and refuses your \"pity money,\" I think the problem is a lot bigger than the toothpaste.", "Something something \"the Iranian Yogurt is NOT the issue here\"\n\nObviously name-calling is bad. But I think you know that it's almost certainly not about the toothpaste. \n\nI think you need to actually think and apologize. She probably feels weird about sharing space with her brother's girlfriend. Then, without asking, you sent into *her* private space and took *her* toiletries. You couldn't be bothered to put it back. It's just...a lot. Additionally, your bf completely dismissing her feelings sucks. Her feelings don't matter any *less* just because she's 17. \n\nWhat are your ages? You didn't state it, but if you're old enough to be living in and renovating a house, you're certainly old enough to know better than to take someone's things without asking. We learned that when we were 3, right?\n\nYTA. BF is worse", "YTA. (BF, too). You don't go use something of someone else's without their permission. This is incredibly basic manners.", "All the comments calling you TA, whaaaaat \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d. NTA! She\u2019s a teenager crying and calling you a bitch over toothpaste. Yeah you might\u2019ve forgotten to take it back to her bathroom, but that\u2019s still not an issue at all. It seems like you and your boyfriend have been together for a while, so you wouldn\u2019t really be new to her environment. You\u2019ve already apologized and offer to buy her more toothpaste, I\u2019d personally ignore her fit. She\u2019ll be embarrassed about it in a few years.", "YTA - You borrowed the toothpaste without asking and didn't bother to return it. It's also kind of gross if you think about it.", "ESH\n\nYou should have asked your bf's sister before borrowing/taking it.\n\nYour bf's sister's reaction was over the top.\n\nMaybe it's time to sit down together and work out how to live peacefully. There may be more going on that you don't realise.", "YTA", "YTA", "NTA. The reaction is way beyond the offense.", "NTA.  You handled it correctly.  You apologized, he explained that it was his fault and you even offered to buy her a full new one.  She just wants to be mad and there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.  I admire your restraint.  If a 17 year old called me a bitch over using toothpaste, I wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to show a 17 year old what a bitch really is.", "YTA you took her stuff without asking her and didn\u2019t return it. That is very disrespectful. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just use your boyfriends toothpaste?", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t want someone taking my expensive stuff without permission either, sounds like it may have been a prescription toothpaste or something similar too. Idk why it has to be explained to you guys not to steal things?", "NTA. You made a mistake. You apologized and offered to replace the toothpaste (WAAAY above and beyond, as you only used one \"dose/serving\". What would you call it with toothpaste?).\n\nShe MASSIVELY overreacted. How embarrassing for her.", "YTA, you rubbed your toothbrush all over her toothpaste. The same toothbrush you put in the mouth you use kiss her brother. Maybe she doesn't want his and your germs on her personal belongings. You did violate her privacy, your bf cannot give you permission to use things he doesn't own. YOU NEED HER PERMISSION. You need to pay to replace the toothpaste. You are not entitled to others belongings because you run out. You and your bf both owe his sister an apology. You may consider apologizing to his parents as well for not respecting their home and the privacy they expect each family member to honor. If I was her parents I would be reconsidering your stay.", "Omg YTA! Your boyfriend is a hugeeee ah! Why didn\u2019t you just go to the store & buy one for yourself?! Are you lazy or what?", "YTA\n\nI don't see any apology from you.  That should have been the first thing you did.", "NTA. He should be telling his sis that she has the opportunity to make a great friend (you) or to make an enemy and that whatever she decides, know that he will always place his partner first.", "NTA - Clearly this girl has been brought up to be a selfish, self centered brat!! Seriously, did she buy the toothpaste, doubtful & even if she did, I guarantee OP didn't use it all & had the brother borrowed it, I again guarantee lil did wouldn't have acted like the biggest AH she could be. \n\nI'm 99% sure this lil girl is the baby of the family & has never had to share a thing. I hope Karma finds her sticky & swiftly.", "NTA \n\nIt's just toothpaste, and your boyfriend told you to use it. Seems like she is looking for a reason to be upset with you. \n\nIs her bathroom only hers, or is it a more communal space? It would be a dick move if you had to go through her room to get to the toothpaste.", "ESH--Teens overreact especially when regarding their privacy, and adults should apologize when they are in the wrong. That's all.", "NTA\n\nI think the brother is an asshole, it\u2019s not his to let you use. And on a level, you knew that. You just followed his order. But I think you know you should have asked her. \n\nAnd the reality is you\u2019ve pissed her off, and yeah, you have to deal with that. She already didn\u2019t like you, don\u2019t see that changing now.", "YTA", "Whatever your gut is telling you is correct. That's a personality disorder and a half. \n\nShe's antagonizing you as a control tactic. This person wants sympathy and attention at any cost.

No. I imagine she needs it. \n\nDo I think it's not ok to call someone a bitch when they meant no harm and had asked someone they thought had an understanding about the situation for guidance? \n\nAlso no. \n\nDo I think this has possibly happened before in the world and there might be solutions that money might aid in? Maybe. \n\nDo I think accepting money as reparations would be appropriate for the aggrieved party? Sure. Do I think she has to call it \"pity money\"? No.", "Again, what good is money if she can't buy the toothpaste until her next refill if it is indeed a prescription?", "Again: Reparations. A gesture of compensation.
