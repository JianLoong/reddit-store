Last week, I spotted him on the playground putting his arm around a girl from his class and when I asked him about it he said she was his girlfriend. My husband laughed and told him \u201cdon\u2019t break too many hearts.\u201d I asked my son if he had asked the girl if it was okay before he put his arm around her and he said no. I gently explained to him that he shouldn\u2019t ever touch girls like that without getting their consent first. He didn\u2019t know what consent meant so I had a mini discussion with him about how it\u2019s not nice to touch people without their permission and asking first means that you know the other person doesn\u2019t mind. My husband was silent during the entire conversation. My son didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by our small talk (which only lasted a couple of minutes), replied with \u201cokay\u201d and then went to go play his switch. After he left the room my husband went off on me, saying that I\u2019m making my son sound like a predator in the making, that it\u2019s just innocent playground fun, and that I\u2019m blowing it way out of proportion. I obviously don\u2019t think my 5th grader is a predator, but I felt like it was important to teach him about the idea of consent from a young age. However, I do have a complicated history when it comes to this subject so maybe that\u2019s clouding my judgment.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1701268517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186qtep/aita_for_saying_you_shouldnt_touch_girls_to_my_10/", "score": 4246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn\u2019t limit it to just boys and girls. It\u2019s kinda funny, because now her sons will be horsing around and she hears from the other room:\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI do not consent to wrestling! Stop, \\[brothers name\\]. Mooooom! I did not consent to wrestling.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOR\r  \n\r  \n\u201cUgh! Personal space, \\[brothers name\\]!!! Mom! Brother is in my personal space.\u201d", "NTA. Teaching kids about consent early on is really importnat, I think your only mistake was telling him he shouldn't touch girls - it should be applied to anyone, and backed up by you and your husband making sure that you also practice what you preach - e.g. not touching him or his siblings (including hugs / kisses)  without their consent, not telling them they have  to give their grandma a hug etc.\n\nlearning good habits such as asking 'can i put my arm round you?' , 'is it OK if I hug you?' etc lay the foundations for conversations about consent in sexual situations as he gets older.\n\nYour husband is wrong to suggest that you're treating him like a predator - on the contrary, you are teaching him how \\*not\\* to grow up to be a predator", "I think you meant well and I agree in theory so I\u2019m voting NTA but I think this could have been handled much better.\n\nFirst, consent should not be a new concept to a ten year old. They may not know that exact word but they should already have a strong foundation for the meaning.\n\nChildren should be taught from the start that they have a say in who touches them and who/how they touch other people. \n\nA ten year old should know basic things about consent - they don\u2019t have to ever hug or kiss people if they don\u2019t want to, they should make sure other people want to be kissed and hugged before doing so, they can and should always use their voice to tell someone when they don\u2019t want to be touched, they should always respect others when they say they don\u2019t want to be touched, etc.\n\nThese conversations shouldn\u2019t be one off things. They should be a continuous, ongoing conversation that evolves with the child. \n\nThey also should never be gender based. Basic human respect doesn\u2019t change by gender. \n\nYour son should feel comfortable being affectionate with all his friends regardless of their gender. He should also be mindful of all his friends boundaries and respect if when they are okay with being touched.\n\nYour husband isn\u2019t the only one treating your son like a \u201cheartbreaker\u201d. You also are treating this like a precursor to dating when in could have been two platonic friends playing with each other.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about teaching him how to treat a partner. It\u2019s about how he treats *everyone.* \n\nBy focusing on partners the danger is unintentionally teaching the idea that only people we are attracted to or care about are worthy of respect. That mindset becomes harmful for many reasons and is hard to rewire.\n\nYour husband was way out of line - you aren\u2019t treating your son like he\u2019s predatory. With that said, I would think about how you want to continue this conversation with your son. It\u2019s much better to have a game plan than to have these conversations caught off guard.", "NTA. It\u2019s a little scary that your 5th grader currently understands more about consent than your husband does. Anyway, you\u2019re not treating your son like a predator. Teaching a kid not to play with a lighter because he might set something on fire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re treating him like he\u2019s a future arsonist. More people should be teaching their kids - boys and girls - about consent from an early age; asking for consent, how to behave when consent is not given or is revoked after being granted, and that it\u2019s okay to have boundaries and not give consent.", "NTA. Lack of conversions like these are why we have men in their 20s and 30s who don\u2019t know what the fuck \u201cno\u201d means.

Predators aren't just born predators, it's learned behavior. Obviously your son putting his arm around a girl isn't really that big of a deal nor does it make him a predator, but it's the perfect introduction to consent in a calm and low stakes way. You did exactly right. Your husband sounds like he's the one with a complicated history...", "I\u2019m making my son sound like a predator in the making\r  \n\r  \nYou're doing the exact opposite. Absolutely NTA. I'm sorry that your husband has insecurities about this, that's red flag territory for me.\r  \n\r  \nI would ask him point blank: how exactly does he think telling your son this could harm him?\r  \n\r  \nBecause there is no rational answer to this. I hope you can work this out and set him straight. Good luck!", "I don't know. Are we expecting him to ask all the time if he put his arm around a girl? Till when?  I'm all for educating consent but for putting an arm around a girl? I think making they do it to people they have a relationship and not just anyone. It's an interesting one and I'm open for a change of opinion.", "YTA do tou ask your boyfriend or husband if you can put your arm around them?", "Please stop doing your part to ruin the next generation of human relationships. YTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs to understand that, although for your son it was just \"innocent fun\", there are boys out there who are bullies and/or sexual predators.  And the more this kind of unwanted touching is allowed, the more the predators can get away with it.  In other words, if 10 boys in the class harass girls in this way, it's \"normal.\" If only one does it, it is easier to recognize the problem.\n\nIt is never too young to teach a child that other people have agency over their own body.", "NTA, but also you need to check your bias.\n\nIf your son was walking around the playground with his arm around his buddy's shoulder, I doubt very much you would have even mentioned it or felt the need to bring up the topic of consent. You would have looked over, seen two boys \"palling around\" and you wouldn't have given it a second thought. \n\nBut because it was a **GIRL**, you chose bring it up. Why?\n\nA talk about consent is absolutely necessary. But in that exact moment? Nah. Your son can have female friends without you hovering over him making sure he gets consent for every single physical contact he makes with them. Ugh.\n\nSo while you may not be the AH, your husband does have a valid point. You mentioned that this topic has been an issue for you in the past, and it is showing.\n\nYou would not have even thought about having the \"consent talk\" if it was boy-boy contact, but because it was boy-girl contact, you got triggered and felt the need to IMMEDIATELY have \"the talk\".\n\nDid he ask for consent? Of course not. He's a kid, on a playground, hanging out with his friend. Don't go inserting your past trauma into that situation. \n\nYou very easily could have brought the topic up at a later time and had a non-specific-to-that-particular-girl conversation with your son about consent.", ".... You guys are actually serious....\nKids... On the playground... Has his hands on a girl who is most likely his friend and you blew a fuse? If it was a boy you wouldn't have thought anything about it. That's nevermind \ud83d\ude02. There's a place and time.... Not on a damn playground... What are they supposed to do? Read? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Nah y'all funny but this Reddit.. I digress.\nWell tops to you mom of the year award. You talking to your son about that was sensible... The where and when and why you did that wasn't even. The girl didn't even mind", "Not gonna proclaim AH either way. It's just peculiar to me that so many people want to force boys into weirdly procedural inorganic interactions with girls. He's 10 playing with a friend of who just so happens to be of the opposite sex. Making it weirdly procedural (explicitly asking for consent before any contact of a completely benign nature) really flies in the face of treating boys and girls as equals because it puts up a barrier to the interaction. \n\nThe whole consent thing is getting kinda out of hand. Like at what point do we need a 6 page notarized release form before we play tag, or give a friendly hug. I think we're already seeing the alienating effects on society where a lot of men don't want to interact with women at all because they have to much to loose, which has the follow on effect of isolating women. In no win situations why play at all?\n\nI think it's important that all kids be taught what lies in the range of \"normal acceptable interactions\", and that if they aren't okay with something regardless of norms they need to make it known and do something about it (Actual empowerment), and that if someone expresses a dislike of something they, did they accept and respect it.", "Soft YTA, but more NTA. I would hope your son is friendly and cordial with all his friends. There is a difference between just doing that to flirt or hit on some girl (which you\u2019ll have to really worry about in a few years). Yes, he should learn about consent, but it sounds like that may not have really been when it was needed, but hey! Why not scare more little boys into anxiety about being a male! Damn little bastards can\u2019t seem to do a thing right! Wouldn\u2019t it have been more appropriate to learn about who this girl is your 10yo is calling his girlfriend instead of jumping to \u201cdId yOU aSk?\u201d", "NTA - If he was 5 years old or less, then maybe this lesson would not have been useful. But he would be in 5th grade now, which is old enough for boys to get curious about various things. And they would definitely do it innocently, but that doesn't mean it would remain innocent for long. It's better to get such important talks now rather than when they are fully grown up and show predatory behaviour", "NTA\n\nTelling your son to respect and get consent is the exact opposite of making him a predator. It's extremely important to make sure he understands consent and it's your husband that needs to be educated.", "My son is 8, he's autistic. I don't know how he touched his teacher but they have been talking to him about consent. He will literally hug anyone, he's super affectionate. A teacher shouldn't have to teach him about boundaries, that's a parents job. I have told him many times to tell people to not touch him if he doesn't want to be touched as well. Its hard, ive been trying to implement boundaries for 3 years now. You should show your husband this thread. Times are changing and people don't consent to touching. I hate it when people touch me as well", "Yta you turned something innocent into something predatory.", "I think 10 isn't too young to talk about consent at all. My kids are younger and we talk about it casually. Where I think YTA is because you had this conversation linked to his behavior towards his friend. Maybe they hug or put their arms around each other all the time etc. It's great to teach him respect for his body and others indeed (no means no) but I think expecting him to ask permission before touching another 10yo at the playground in an innocent way is a bit much.", "YTA for this specific situation. \n\nNothing wrong with having a chat about consent, but assuming your 10 year old son is wrongfully touching a girl makes you TAH. As if every single time humans touch there is a question/conversation about consent. That's nuts.", "You are indeed the asshole", "Only T-A if you have given your daughters the same talk, and by that I mean exactly the same", "YTA. This is real life. Not some theory. People are capable of gauging the comfort level of their own relationships. This is not so extreme he needed to ask permission. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t ask your husband his consent to hold his hand. Why should he ask to put his arm around his girlfriend??? \nThis seems more like you wanted to pat yourself in the back for being a good feminist, instead of being rational. \nYes talk to him about consent. But to act like he should have ask, is making it out like he did something wrong by not asking. And he didn\u2019t. It\u2019s so awkward and lame to be asked permission for the simplest things. \nIn fact in school the only guys who would ask permission for simple things like a hug were the creeps.", "YTA'ish. It's never wrong to teach about consent. To anyone. I assume you had the same talk with your teenage girls. But there's a time and a place for it. Having the conversation as a response to a 10 year old having his arm around a classmate... that's a clear overreaction in my opinion. He's 10. Come on. You may have turned it into a way bigger problem. \n\nAnd then there's people here calling your husband a predator? That's just plain misandry. Stop this madness.", "YTA for teaching your son that consent only applies to girls/women. \n\nThat\u2019s what made your husband feel the way he did. You\u2019re trying to explain consent while teaching that only one gender has the ability to give their consent. \n\nIt reminds me of that time a [fan grabbed onto Adam Levine](https://youtu.be/LoPQ_wnknfY?si=uWV84JEYUB9QhhkD) from Maroon 5 and a large portion of the ladies were complaining about how he reacted. Plot twist.

The fact that at TEN he still doesn\u2019t have an IDEA as to what consent was before now, is because you\u2019ve never forced anyone to gain HIS consent, and your husband knows that.", "YTA for making such a big deal about it. I suspect that if he had hugged a guy friend that you would not have reacted at all.", "NTA - it is absolutely yours and your husband\u2019s responsibility to teach your son consent.

Along with reinforcing it along the way.\n\nYou because you specifically called out girls when consent is gender neutral.", "NAH - I get both points of view. I will say this though, based on what you wrote it sounds like (apologies if I\u2019m misinterpreting), the fact it was a girl is what bothers you. Boys need to consent too. \n\nIt\u2019s a good lesson for your son and, frankly, you are blowing it a bit out of proportion. That does not an asshole make, however.", "NTA for teaching your son about consent. You shouldn't make this a boy-girl-thing, though. You should be teaching all of your kids about consent and not touching anyone without consent.\n\nAt the same time it's normal for kids that age not to have the same kind of physical boundaries that we have as we go through puberty and get older, so - outside of using it as a teachable moment -  I wouldn't read too much into it.", "NTA, those little moments in childhood are great for teaching kids about future social behavior. Seems like a big over reaction.", "INFO. Was the girl he was touching bothered by it? Were they playing beforehand or did he just walk up and do that?\n\nI get your husbands point, 5 year olds aren't sexual yet so all this talk about consent is a little weird. Kids touch eachother when playing around, it's no big deal. And I'm 100% sure you wouldn't have had this conversation with him if he was wrestling with another boy or something.\nTeaching kids about consent is important but there's a time and a place for it, and this situation was so innocuous I don't see why you felt the need to do that unless the girl was bothered by it.", "Nta the sooner young children learn about consent, the better", "I\u2019m just curious, if he asks and she said yes, potentially she could feel pressured and actually not be consenting ? Maybe it would be better if he wrote out a proposal and gave her a week to consider before committing??", "Did you have the same exact conversations with your daughters? If not then your definitely TA.", "OP, Just a question?  At what age did you start teaching your daughters not to touch boys before they obtained consent?\n\nYTA", "NTA.

It shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a girl or boy, consent should be obtained before touching anyone. Likewise, he shouldn\u2019t be touched without his consent too.", "NTA nothing wrong with teaching him about boundaries", "INFO\n\nDo you know anything about your son's history with this girl and their level of familiarity?\n\nWould you also say your husband needs to verbally ask you for consent every time he puts his arm around you?", "Soft YTA.

The little girl may not mind but unless you know her parents it\u2019s better for him to play it safe. There\u2019s a lot of people out there itching for a fight over this stuff", "NTA, your husband needs to realise that things like this need to be taught, he doesnt wake up to good behavior one morning out of nowhere. Ask your husband how he learned about consent and right and wrong, would he be ok with his son in current society to do same stuff he did and how would that affect your son in school etc. \n\nYour husband needs to remember how boys were around the same age when \"consent\" and respect for girls wasn't a thing. I had boys pull down my pants repeatedly around that age cause they thought it was funny. But its only because their parents didn't make attempts at educating what they were doing was harassment and not ok.\n\nAsk your husband, if its not your place to educate him how to do better - then WHO will do it? The air around him?", "NTA - It is really important to teach consent from a young age, it is easier to assimilate. When you teach him not to hit is friends when he is angry, nobody raise an eyebrow and tell you that you see him has a violent child or a future DV. It is a disproportionate reaction from your husband and a irrational one at that. Consent is a social skill that he also needs to learn like any other skill. Yes it is innocent action from a child, until it is not.", "Look up the boundary song on youtube.

As a father of a daughter around the same age, I very much appreciate you explaining this to your son.  We explain consent in the exact same way to her when it comes to herself and to others being touched.  Kids get it right away, adults not so much.", "NTA. You're definitely teaching him the opposite of what your husband says. Recognizing and understand the importance of consent (regardless of gender) from a young age is extremely important. Not only are you helping your son to respect other peoples' boundaries, but it also shows him that he also has autonomy over *HIS* body.", "YTA. Your husband is right. The others here saying NTA are delusional. It\u2019s just 10 years old having fun, you\u2019re gonna turn him into a laughing stock and target for bullying if he actually takes your advice and starts asking everyone for permission.\n\nAlso point of fact, 90% of human interaction is physical, no one ever asked for consent to touch someone and it would have been if they had. The ones that don\u2019t like to be touched tend to be the loners and outcasts from majority of social circles. It\u2019s like some of y\u2019all don\u2019t remember your school days.\n\nSexual consent is for sex and physical consent with strangers. Friends have implied consent in many situations, many of you need to learn the different social cues. No teenagers going around asking each other, can I do this, can I do that, can I hug you after we scored a goal, etc..", "NAH.\n\nYou meant well so I won\u2019t call you an AH here, but honestly, I\u2019m getting serious helicopter parent vibes here.\n\nConsent is extremely important and you should absolutely teach your son about it.

Your kid is not magic and he is not immune from doing anything wrong. Your job as a parent is to coach and teach him to avoid that. And the lessons your husband is trying to teach very well could make him into a predator.\n\nBut, great parents are teaching consent a lot earlier than 10 and a long time before it looks romantic. So if you were on track this wouldn't have looked like an intervention into a problematic behavior or a lecture. It would have looked like a series of questions your son already knew the answers to: \"is it OK for someone to pick you up or hug you without your permission?\" \"do we pull other kids along with us or grab them to play without asking what they want?\"", "YTA for making it a gender thing and not a people thing furthermore this also applies to him and they should also ask him for consent.", "NTA\n\nGood job starting to teach your son about consent. If anything, you're starting a bit late.\n\nAlso note that consent isn't just about sex, or sex-adjacent activities: your son should also be asking if he can hug his friend in a completely platonic, non-romantic way.

As others have pointed out, this was a valuable lesson for your son. What we also need to do as parents is reinforce the idea that in addition to getting consent from others, children have to give consent as well.

She really wants one.\" Body autonomy is very important and we need to support our kids on this end, too.", "NTA \n\n\n\nPredator in the making? You are literally doing the opposite of that.

I punched him in the face, we both got in trouble, and it was an awkward & uncomfortable situation even for children. If his mother had the conversation you did, maybe he would have thought twice before grabbing my face and kissing me. Helping your kids set healthy boundaries for themselves & others should not cause your husband to react that way.

NOT AT ALL.   \n\n\nYou are a good person, and this is a perfect age to introduce the ideas of consent to him.

We let it him decide so for your husband to get pissed off saying that your son is a predator or you calling your son a predator when you're realistically teaching him about consent. Is pretty concerning to me. Because if he's already going off on you about that is he a predator? Because I've only seen predators get pissed off when shit like that happens. It's like when you talk about other certain topics and people get so pissed off about it and you find out that they have done it or that they always do it.

And you make they easy prey for sexual predators.** \n\nAlso, whether you want to acknowledge it or not, stranger danger is not the biggest risk to your children's sexual safety. If they're assaulted, it is much more likely to be by someone they know. When they're older, this includes friends and dating partners. But when they're young? This means *your* family and friends are *their* biggest risk. Don't make them more vulnerable by teaching them to allow abuse.\n\n> Is there any middle ground to this? \n\nThe middle ground is that children have to say goodbye to say polite BUT this goodbye doesn't have to be a hug or kiss.

Conversly, they need to be taught others don't have the right to touch them without their permission. I believe there is no other page to be on other than treating people with dignity and respect. Consent is part of that. I would not have a child with a partner that did not share that value. Would your opinion be different if OP's kid sucker-punched another kid on the playground? Would OP be an AH if she told her kid that laying their hands on another person like that is wrong? Does she need to check in with her husband on common human decency? Come on.\n\nSo - I'm all for non-verbal consent. So long as all the parties involved are mature and experienced enough to correctly interpret those non-verbal cues. My wife and I didn't verbally check in with each other after our first date before we kissed, but we did kiss goodnight. This worked because it was obvious to me (as an adult with prior experience in dating and verbal and non-verbal consent) that we were into each other, and there was no doubt in my mind that it was what she wanted to happen.\n\nMy boys (and I would bet that this 10-year-old in question) are not wise or mature enough to handle non-verbal consent. For non-verbal consent to work, both parties must know about.....consent.\n\nSo, how should a parent teach consent? They should talk about it with their kid, just like OP did.  Consent is about self-respect and respecting others. Again...there is no other page to be on. The dad is wrong here that it makes his son look like a creep. Not respecting other's boundaries is creepy.\n\nIf you never talk about consent (explicit verbal consent or otherwise), your kids may grow up thinking they can touch anybody and anybody can touch them.

I didn\u2019t want him trying to give her mouth kisses since she would pull away. That would hurt his feelings and I didn\u2019t want to set him up for that. Him and his sister are 6 years apart. As a result he hasn\u2019t tried giving kisses yet but that\u2019s fine too. He still loves to get them. He does hug though. He smiles when he gets kisses and an even bigger smile when his sister hugs him. He even reaches out for her when walking or coming to give him a hug. She gladly takes his hand or hugs him. They have the deepest bond I have ever seen in siblings. Closer than twins actually.", "As a man who has been victimized by other people's lack of regard for own consent, it's so lovely to hear that it's *less common* and therefore *less important*.\n\nUnfortunately, for me, I only get this *one* life to live in. So to me the relative likelihood has stopped mattering. The chances on my own life is 100%. And if OP's son is only coached on how to not be a perpetrator, he might end up especially primed to be a victim. When you are instructed that women are at risk of being victimized by men, and nothing else, it becomes fairly easy for a bad actor to weaponize that language in service of abusing a man.\n\nJust saying, this is the opportunity to talk about *the problem*, but OP focused on the version that she feels threatened by to the exclusion of other types - including the version that could victimize her son, himself. When I grew up, people talked a lot about consent, and autonomy. But always through the lens of women. Once men stopped being boys, I never heard a word about my own consent, and the rape and sexual assault of men was an absolute joke to the broader culture whether it was by a man or a woman.\n\nI get that people want to triage the broadest issue they see, but teaching this as a universal truth doesn't cost anyone *anything.* That consent is critical does not need to be a gendered lesson - and any attempt to teach the importance of respecting the consent of others, without also teaching the importance of our own consent and autonomy is a factually incomplete lesson, regardless of the audience.\n\nIf this was about social services for survivors, surely the stats matter. But to a young man who spent his youth being repeatedly taught and reminded not to victimize women, only to be victimized by one and *almost no one* takes it seriously or cares, the stats are trivia. Trivia that is sadly invoked to justify a lopsided focus on the victimization of women when teaching about consent.\n\nIts one thing for a college campus to have a targeted campaign of education or awareness about more specific, more gendered instantiations of sexual violence. But inasmuch as the core lesson around consent and autonomy go, there is no gendered component to it at all. I'm not convinced wedging one in there is valuable to girls. Consent just *always* matters. *Always.* It's the truest version of the rule, and also the simplest to teach. Making it any more complicated is doing everyone a disservice.", "Misandry.

A world where the default behaviour is love, warmth and affection and we only withhold it for those who opt out.\n2. A world where the default behaviour is distance, coldness and loneliness and if we want anything different, we must first explicitly opt in\n\nI, and I think most people, emphatically would prefer the first world. Love needs to be the rule, not the exception.\n\nThe lowest common denominator approach of constraining society wide human behaviour for fear of upsetting or offending the small minority of people who suffer from maladaptive human behaviours is harmful to society as a whole.\n\nThe best solution for society as a whole to the problem you describe is for the minority of people who struggle to stand up for themselves learn to better stand up for themselves and assert their boundaries, not for the rest of the world to enable their problem by joining them in human isolation.", "Depends exactly what *\u201dphysical\u201d* in this context means.\n\nWe use body language and facial expressions to gauge *a lot* of information because people lie, even if it\u2019s something as simple saying you don\u2019t want food when you actually do.

Yes, if you hugged someone every day and asked concern every day, probably would get old real fast.

Funny how it was always very welcomed", "That's not denormalizing basic human interaction that IS basic human interaction.

Just because it's worded differently doesn't mean it isn't the same interaction that's always happened. \n\nSibling A wants to push limits and annoy sibling B. Sibling B isn't in the mood for that and tells them to cut it out. Sibling B saying \"I don't consent to you poking me.\" instead of \"stop poking me\" gets across the same message and is ultimately the same experience. \n\nHowever, I do agree that consent talks should be equal.
