My bf (21M) called me & we talked a bit, but I said I had to go cause I had to get ready to go or we were going to miss our movie. He said okay & asked if I could send him a pic of my outfit. I said okay. By the time I was done, we were running late. My friend & I grabbed our stuff & left. I put my phone down in the car to talk to my friend cause we don't hangout a ton, so I wanted to focus on her.\n\nAfter, I was starting to feel uncomfy in my outfit & cold & wanted to change into comfy clothes. I changed & headed over to my friend's.\nWhen we got there, I realized I had forgotten to send my bf a pic of my outfit. I texted him apologizing for not sending one because I forgot & I was also busy spending time with my friend. His response was \"You fr? You couldn't have taken 12 seconds, love?\" I apologized & said no since I had forgotten & we were late & after I wanted to change. I also described to him the outfit I wore so that he wouldn't feel left in the dark. He says \"I don't see any reason why you couldn't have taken a pic in the car right before you change.\" I apologized once more & said I was busy talking to her & had forgotten. It kind of continued on with me apologizing. He said \"I feel like you disregard the little things. You didn't take my feelings into consideration? I literally had one request, baby. It was the easiest of things. What, you just pick & choose the times you wanna care for me?\"\n\nAt this point I was getting confused & anxious & kept apologizing & saying his feelings do matter. I tell him I feel that he's acting odd & being a bit harsh. \nHe says \"I want to be honest with my opinions, but that\u2019s being harsh. I want to lie & say it\u2019s okay but that doesn\u2019t fix anything. I\u2019m hurt. I\u2019m really hurt. I don\u2019t know if you realize this but I love to see you. All the time. I like your outfits & your style. I love them. I\u2019m not being harsh when I say that taking a pic & sending it to me is not a huge expenditure of time & that you even couldn\u2019t do that. You forgot about it even.\"\nI felt like crying & said \"I didn't know you were this incredibly hurt that I did not send you my outfit because I was busy & spending time with my friend.\" \nHis response was \"That\u2019s outta place?! Here you go again diminishing my emotions. That has such a passive aggressive tone to it.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time I feel he's reacted strongly. There was a time he was leaving my house & said he had to go soon. I didn't know when he said soon, he meant right now. I was in the middle of putting deodorant on & said ok. He was hurt about that & said he was going so I went over to him & said I didn't know he was leaving right then. I asked him if it would be okay for me to finish what I was doing. He said yes. So I finished up so that I could give him my attention & say bye. Later on, he said that he was feeling hurt that I didn't put aside what I was doing to say bye to him. He said it made him not feel like a priority.", "created_utc": 1680877491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12emzpe/aita_for_not_sending_my_boyfriend_a_picture_of_my/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
