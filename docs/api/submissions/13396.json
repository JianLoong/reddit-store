They've known eachother about 5 years longer than I have. I'm closer to T but i consider them both to be good friends. I visited K when i was in her city for work and she told me we should all be going to surprise T in her county for her birthday. I eagerly said I'd go. A couple weeks later I asked K for updates so i can book my flight etc and she said they had told T who said she was too busy to plan anything. I understood we werent going. T and i were meant to call a few days later but she kept moving the call and saying she didn't feel well. I didnt push her but messaged her the next week to ask for her address to send her birthday present. She was thankful and sent it. I then called and messaged T on her birthday but recieved no response and saw no postings on insta so i was concerned. I messaged K asking if T is ok and if she'd heard from her. Neither of them replied me. K then posted on insta thanking T for an amazing weekend  to which I responded that I didn't think we were going anymore due to what she said etc. K explains that T finally decided to organise something a couple weeks ago and just kept it to certain friends as there were \"too many to invite\" and that she's told T that I called. She's also sorry for not keeping me in the loop but she was busy and I didn't ask again about the party. I responded that T doesn't need to call me back. T has posted on instagram since and not written back to me. T was not at home when her present was being delivered and is now at a pickup location. I didn't let her know and redirected it so she won't recieve it. \n\nAITA for leaving our group chat (they clearly don't consider me as their friend) and also for redirecting her present?", "created_utc": 1680014833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124r1n1/aita_for_redirecting_my_friends_birthday_present/", "score": 1160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucks to find out you aren\u2019t as friendly with someone as you\u2019d expect but luckily you were able to redirect the gift.

You have it right.", "NTA\n\nFuck 'em.", "NTA. Some people are just not worth any further effort once they show their true colors.", "NTA.  Being left out when you thought you were friends, sucks.  What they did, especially T, was cowardly.  If you did something to offend her at some point, then she should have talked to you about it, if you were good friends.  Also, sometimes petty jealously comes into play if friends feel one is more successful and accomplished then the other.  I don't know if this is the case with you and T.   Whatever the case, I think redirecting the present and going NC with them is probably the thing to do.", "NTA that is very hurtful, and they know it, thats why they ignored you. I would have done the same with the gift and i think you are probably right to have left the GC. No need to be made to feel worse then you already do.", "The fact that you need to ask this at all. NO don't send a gift to someone who clearly doesn't think of you as a close personal friend. She let you tell her that you were sending a gift, and didn't say no that's ok.  What a user. I would be weary of the other friend as well, as she was in the loop and kept you out. With friends like that who needs strangers? NTA and send it to someone who would really appreciate it.", "NTA- these are no friends of yours.", "NTA. Friendships end. Apparently, this one ended and they didn't bother to tell you. I'm sorry they were jerks.", "NTA", "Only thing you did wrong was that you didn't wish them the best and not to bother contacting you again.", "Uh, NTA. Feel free to never interact with them going forward. Don't give either of these two any thought. Return the present or keep it for yourself.", "NTA - why would you humuliate yourself by giving this person a gift?", "Very, very, *very* soft YTA. But so is she. If she didn't know about the gift beforehand, I would say you have every right to redirect that gift, but since you told her about it, and got an address to send it to, it might look a tad manipulative to have the gift *not* show up after she coincidentally neglected to invite you to her party.\n\nAnother important thing: what is the gift? How expensive was it? And does she know what it was or its price range?", "ESH you all sound unbearable", "10/10", "[removed]", "I know T is an asshole here, but I think K was too, maybe to a lesser degree.\n\nThey are all supposed to be friends, and T proceeded to kick her out of the party, lie about it and then still demand a gift. And K knew about this the entire time, that her friend OP was being mistreated, and she was completely fine with that. I doesn't seem like someone OP should be friends with either.", "IDK, either T made it explicit she doesn\u2019t want OP there so K kept mum, or K\u2019s full in on it. Either way it sounds like either of them is a lot more trouble than their worth.\n\nI\u2019ve had a semi similar experience. I was relatively new in town and I guess I was somewhat desperate for friends. I got acquainted with these group of people from a gaming community. Turns out the main reason they took me in is because one of the guys like me. They kept pairing me up with him even though I\u2019ve mentioned several times it makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe fallout happened shortly before my birthday. I invited everyone for a bowling night and most accepted. But a couple of days before they kept teasing and prodding me again about the guy, and I publicly denounced any interest towards him. \n\nYou\u2019d think this isn\u2019t new considering how many times I told them this before but literally moments after they started cancelling on me one by one, forcing me to cancel my plans altogether. Only for them to send photos in OUR groupchat on the night of my bday, with all of them at the bowling alley.\n\nCut all ties with all of them after that. One of them tried to casually ask me to lunch (we work in the same company then) the Monday after. They claim they didn\u2019t know about the plan but it\u2019s bullshit, considering the bowling alley party was MY plan, for MY birthday. You\u2019d either have to be super dumb or super callous to not even realize what\u2019s happening.", "Is there a non-rude way to let someone who apparently considers you a close friend that you don't return the closeness. I am very interested how all these people calling T and K assholes would handle the situation. T doesn't consider the OP a close friend and wants to have a birthday party with only a few people, so she doesn't invite her; that's her right, and she isn't necessarily an asshole for that, maybe they grew apart, maybe the OP misunderstood the closeness. The only thing I think she should have done differently is accept the gift; she should have told the OP she shouldn't bother sending a gift from another country, but maybe she didn't know how to do that politely. As for K, I don't know whether it's reasonable to expect anyone to tell a friend that another friend doesn't  like them as much as they thought. In retrospect, she should have said something instead of letting the OP find out from sm, but I don't see bad intentions here. Maybe these women do such, but also maybe it's just the awkwardness of a friendship ending.", "Oh, I think T will definitely care. We've seen plenty of examples of entitlement from people like that, who would still expect a gift and call OP petty.", "Exactly", "'This friendship has run its course, please send your goodbye gift to the following address'. Nope, T's either in or out, can't have both!", "We are <3", "All you did was match the energy given to you, I appreciate the petty. You deserve better friends for sure", "[removed]", "Karma farming bot.", "[removed]", "Ouch that's painful  :( sorry that happened to you", "Wow, I hope Karma gets them someday!", "The question is whether or not OP is the AH for redirecting the gift. I think the answer is no. K and T both knew OP wanted to celebrate the birthday and, rather than say anything, let OP find out about it from social media that she wasn't included. T does not deserve a gift. OP is not the AH.", "How about being an adult and using your words? Say something along the lines of we aren't as close as you obviously feel and are having a small intimate party with people here. Why is it so difficult to be honest and say what you think or feel in a non- rude or non-condescending way?", "I\u2019m not sure if there is a non- rude way, but the least they could have done was communicate feelings and intentions instead of leaving OP on read.", "The conversation is awkward, for sure, but ghosting someone and ignoring the issue except to tell that person where they can send the gift is an asshole move. T should have gotten back to OP and told them that they only wanted a small party with very close friends, which IS the nice way to tell someone you're not as close as they thought. And then she should have let OP decide if they still wanted to send a gift. \n\nAs for K, she's the one who created the issue to begin with. 'Hey, OP, let's visit T on her birthday'. She's supposedly close to OP to do this, so when T told her she wasn't inviting OP and her way to deal with it was going to be ghosting her, she should most definitely have gone back to OP to tell her that, in whichever tactful way she could think of. \n\nIgnoring people who are trying to communicate with you expecting the problem to go away is not awkward, is an asshole move.", "Exactly. In a few days, she\u2019ll be texting OP because the gift didn\u2019t arrive.", "[removed]", "Thanks OP. I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you too. But my take away really is that at least the sooner I know, the sooner I could stop wasting time on the wrong people. It\u2019s easy for me to consider situations like this as \u201cnot my loss.\u201d\n\nAlthough cards on the table I\u2019m also the type of person who has 0 remorse for cutting someone off once I\u2019ve had it with them. (At least according to my friend of 20 odd years. \ud83d\ude05)", "And then OP can be like \u201chuh that\u2019s weird, let me look into that and get back to you\u201d and then just not get back to her", "If that occurs, OP should let T know they they were mistaken at the level of friendship they shared.", "Well then, this looks like it will sort itself out on its own then, don\u2019t you think?", "No offense OP, but I think that's what she wants anyway.", "But does she even think she did anything wrong?", "This is a karma farming bot.

That tells me they didn't value her as a friend in the first place. Time to get new ones.", "NTA\n\nYou said it yourself \"*they clearly don't consider me as their friend*\".  So yeah, redirect the gift, and move on. You deserve better friends.", "It is the worst feeling ever to be a part of a group that cuts you out. Blatantly! This was on purpose. I guarantee you, when K told T that y'all were planning a trip, she didn't want to include you. So they just cut you out and lied. Neither one is worth a second thought... much less a gift.

I love how she had no problem tricking you into sending her a gift.  Send her a box of dog shit that explodes when she opens it!", "NTA. She can be bothered to respond if it means getting a gift but is otherwise too unwell. I\u2019m calling BS. T is not a good person.", "NTA. But I'm curious, it is very rare, if not impossible, for a buyer to be able to redirect an order in my region, or pretty much other regions I've lived. Which seller was it? Local? Online?", "NTA. They intentionally excluded you as someone not in the circle. Which, while that may sting, they are allowed to do. You can't force someone to be close to you.\n\nHowever, they didn't have the integrity to be open about where you stand, and tried to hide it from you, and you clearly saw it for what it was.\n\nIf she's still there, now, waiting for her present, you might want to ask K to tell her it's not coming, but if you're not close enough to be included in the recognition of her birthday, she has no business expecting a present from you.", "NTA", "NTA. Cut them loose and move on.", "NTA have it delivered back to yourself and move on from these \"friends\"", "NTA. These people are not your friends. Sorry you got treated that way.", "NTA, they aren't good friends to you, obviously. T should have told you that the plan changed (or that they lied to you about not going in the first place). I had a few friends like this and I'm much happier since I stopped being \"friends\" with them!", "NTA. Why would you buy a gift for someone who obviously doesn't consider you a friend?", "Good ol social media. \nThe gift that keeps on giving because no matter the issue, they just have to boast post and out comes the truth.\nGreat move on the gift.\nLine drawn.

Tell her you understand being uninvited from her birthday celebration is her way of letting you know you aren\u2019t a friend.  Say you are sorry to learn how little you matter but will roll with.

They definitely have a stacked tier of friends and you're not on the top one with them.

Somebody could  have at least been honest. Since they weren\u2019t I would take the hint.", "NTA but perhaps try not to be too childish and or vengeful about the realization of how your friendship is valued. You learn and move on to things you deem worth your efforts.", "Definitely time to move on from the T relationship, but this seems like a bunch of social missteps rather than anyone being super shitty.\n\nK assumed T would want OP to visit. Seems like that's not the case - so K had accidently put them both in an awkward spot. If it was just dinner, suck it up and invite OP, rather than hurt her feelings. But this is T needing to host OP for a few days, so that's a much bigger \"burden\".\n\nThey were probably embarrassed about the situation so handled it poorly. K should have been upfront or not let the cat out of the bag with the social media post. T should have told OP no gift was necessary and not given the address.\n\nBut its not like T is badgering OP about a gift or trying to pretend OP has nothing to be hurt over. She's just letting the friendship die a natural death. NAH.\n\nEdit: I think OP is doing herself a disservice by opting out of the group chat. K and the other people do like her. Just talk to them and clear the air rather than throwing away a bunch of friendships. Can no one deal with a little awkwardness anymore?", "But Tis interested in getting gifts from friends she ghosts", "This is the way.
