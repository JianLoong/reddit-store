They've known eachother about 5 years longer than I have. I'm closer to T but i consider them both to be good friends. I visited K when i was in her city for work and she told me we should all be going to surprise T in her county for her birthday. I eagerly said I'd go. A couple weeks later I asked K for updates so i can book my flight etc and she said they had told T who said she was too busy to plan anything. I understood we werent going. T and i were meant to call a few days later but she kept moving the call and saying she didn't feel well. I didnt push her but messaged her the next week to ask for her address to send her birthday present. She was thankful and sent it. I then called and messaged T on her birthday but recieved no response and saw no postings on insta so i was concerned. I messaged K asking if T is ok and if she'd heard from her. Neither of them replied me. K then posted on insta thanking T for an amazing weekend  to which I responded that I didn't think we were going anymore due to what she said etc. K explains that T finally decided to organise something a couple weeks ago and just kept it to certain friends as there were \"too many to invite\" and that she's told T that I called. She's also sorry for not keeping me in the loop but she was busy and I didn't ask again about the party. I responded that T doesn't need to call me back. T has posted on instagram since and not written back to me. T was not at home when her present was being delivered and is now at a pickup location. I didn't let her know and redirected it so she won't recieve it. \n\nAITA for leaving our group chat (they clearly don't consider me as their friend) and also for redirecting her present?", "created_utc": 1680014833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124r1n1/aita_for_redirecting_my_friends_birthday_present/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wasn't interested in having you be part of her celebration because she has \"too many \\[friends\\] to invite\".  \n\nYou wouldn't want her to have too many gifts to open.", "NTA. Sounds like they don't deserve your friendship. Return the gift and buy yourself something nice!", "NTA - You're not wrong, neither of these people are friends. Shitty behavior from them both and yeah she doesn't deserve a present. She deserves the middle finger at best which you kind of delivered here.  Good for you", "NTA. I don't know about K, but T has definitely made it clear they aren't interested in friendship with you for whatever reason. Hella rude way to let you know. T does not deserve a gift.", "These children are not your friends. NTA", "NTA. Time to find some real friends. Those women sound like mean girls who never grew up.", "NTA. Time to make new friends!", "NTA, do not entertain any friendship with them. You are dodging a bullet from fake friends. Be merry:)", "T doesn't consider you as good a friend as you do her.  I am so sorry, I know that hurt.  No, you are not obligated to give a gift to anyone, but especially not someone who doesn't value your friendship.  I hope you are able to move on without feeling hurt, people sadly change and connections fade.  Be happy in your current life with your friends and family.  NTA.", "NTA, lucky for you, you have 2 less sh*tty people in your life to care about. I wish you the best, return it and buy something special for yourself. Or hell keep it, and post it on Instagram before you block them.", "NTA.\n\nK and T planned a party and you were not invited... they don't consider you to be close... so you can send the package to moon and they will not care...\n\nChange your friends...", "NTA. Not your friend, doesn't deserve a gift from you. Time to move away from this 'friendship' as it doesn't seem to be a good one.", "NTA at all, drop them, they\u2019re not worth it", "NTA. I\u2019m a bit biased though. I did a similar thing when I found out the group had made a separate group chat without me in it in order to plan events specifically so I wouldn\u2019t know about them.", "Welp.... hopefully you ordered something you like! \n\nNTA \u2014 some people just make it challenging to like them.", "NTA. Being busy is no excuse for lacking common courtesy particularly through texting. Your right, they don't consider you a friend.  This is one of the times it is acceptable to revoke a present.  If T raises a stink about it then it's additional confirmation of what they think of you.  Block them and move on, you don't need shitty friends who won't text you a simple plans have changed text after you reached out.  K and T did what they wanted from the start.", "NTA They're awful and I hope you make better friends.", "NTA they aren't your friends.", "NTA.  They definitely aren't your friends.  Send your gift to someone that appreciates you.", "NTA. Cut these Mean Girls out of your life. Move on, and I promise you\u2019ll feel much happier for not having chaos and drama in your life. I wish I had figured this out before my 40s, Lol.", "NTA - L \u201cfriends\u201d", "NTA & drop both of them!", "NTA\n\nOy. This sounds very hurtful and I would be upset, too. But sometimes people just grow apart, even if it's only one person doing so. You clearly considered yourself to be closer to T but she's not obligated to include you in birthday plans just b/c K initially put the idea out there. However, she should have begged off when you asked for her address to send a gift.", "NTA.  If they don't want you there that's their choice.  You aren't owed being invited.  What they do kinda owe you is anything but silence.  Learning that you aren't as good of friends as you thought is a bit tough, but their absolute silence when you called or texted just lets you know where your value is.  I would probably distance myself too.", "You were lucky the present wasn't received so that you could redirect it. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Trust me, I\u2019ve been the \u201cfriend that is somehow left out of the important plans\u201d too many times in my life. Don\u2019t waste your time with these girls. You may see T as a close friend, but she doesn\u2019t see you as one.", "NTA.\n\nK and T both don't seem too interested in you right now.", "NTA with friends like that who need enemy\u2019s!", "Nta", "NTA, no invite, no present.", "NTA. If this person didn't want you at their party, they don't need your gift. Bad way to find out someone isn't really a friend,  but at least you know now not to waste your time.", "NTA", "YANTH for, \"leaving our group chat (they clearly don't consider me as their friend) and also for redirecting her present?\"", "NTA, cut your losses and move on", "NTA. Glad you found out not to put your energy into these relationships !", "nope.  you did the right thing.", "Is it really so freaking hard to make up a couple of names to make your post semi-readable?\n\nNAH.
