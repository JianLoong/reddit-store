I live in Canada though, so we don't get to see much authentic Mexican food here.  I also know that I am grateful for whatever people bring to a dinner I am hosting though, not matter how \"easy\" I think it is to make.

Or jambalaya. Or gazpacho. Or a quesadilla. \n\nThat's me. I'm that person. I also have no idea what a tamale is.\n\nI don't think that's the issue, though. It's not about the tamale. It could've been anything else. Could've been borscht or b\u00f6rek. The issue is that when someone brings food for dinner as a guest, you don't wrinkle your nose and ask why they don't bring something else unless they're bringing something truly inappropriate and low-effort, like a bottle of coke. \n\nBut when you hear that someone is bringing a \"dish\" from their culture, you assume that there's a good deal of effort going into it even if you don't understand what that dish is. Mainly because when people get the chance to bring a traditional dish to a holiday or celebration, they're using it as a chance to show off the best of their food culture. And if you care about them feeling included, you should hope that enough people will try that food so that the guest knows their effort was appreciated.\n\nThe issue is that OP has no grace or class. If she did, even if she didn't want to try the tamales, a classy person would have beamed and said, \"That sounds wonderful.\" And if she was concerned about there not being enough familiar foods there for herself and the other diners, she should have made a mental note to buy a few extra things. That's it.", "I would like to state that as a white person, I'd be thrilled to get tamales.", "How hard would it have been for this ignorant to Google \u201ctamales\u201d\u2026..it\u2019s clear she has no interest in learning anything outside of her sad, colorless little world, sorry to say that but\u2026.", ">Ain't nobody making tamales for people they don't like.\n\nI was told this by a little Mexican lady once when I was having a mental crisis. I sobbed to her that I 'knew' no one really needed or wanted me, and she told me that's \"Cow shit, because I make Tamales every time I know you'll visit and that is how Mexican Mamas say they love you. Now eat, you'll feel better with a belly full of food.\"\n\nShe was right, I did feel a little better. Unfortunately I also realized I wasn't getting any better so I left her kitchen and my stepdad took me straight to a mental hospital.

And this is not uncommon in other cultures, either: sweet + spicy salty is a good mix", "I've never heard of sweet rolls with Thanksgiving dinner, but the dinner is already a combination of sweet + salty (turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, some veggie sides for salty, then sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce for sweet) so I guess it's just an extension of that.
