Crazy Mexican food no one else is going to eat us what it is! \n\n/s\n\nHow white and insulated can you possibly be to not know what a tamale is?  It's not a roll.  WTF?  They are also, as already pointed out, extremely labor intensive.  And extremely delicious!  Tamales are a way of saying I love you in Mexican culture.  Ain't nobody making tamales for people they don't like.  \n\nI hope OP doesn't get ANY tamales.  What an AH.", "I've never had tamales, but they are 100% at the top of my list of foods to try! \n\nSide note: if anyone can tell me where to get them in southern alberta, I'll love you forever!", "So you mean Thanksgiving is to give thanks and appreciate people? And here I thought it was for being racist and judging others for not bringing her white idea of what should be brought! (Sarcasm)", "This this this!! Also grew up in Texas and omg who doesn\u2019t want HOMEMADE tamales!? OP definitely needs a reality check and lessons on how not to be racist.", "You can make them in Europe if you can find a place that sells the right corn flour. Masa flour?  And the right chillies.  They are a serious faff though.  I usually manage to make about 12 because I don't have a big enough pot.", "YTA  Me too jealous!!!!\n\nHomemade tamales are so delicious and take a great amount of effort to make!!!\n\nI really hope that you show Sara your appreciation for sharing such thoughtful and delicious dishes and sharing her heritage with the family.\n\nWe are a culturally diverse country.  Embrace it!!  That's what Thanksgiving is all about!", "Fellow Texan, can confirm. I literally just put tamales in the fridge this morning when unpacking my godfather\u2019s cooler when he arrived. \n\nOP, you and your atrophied tastebuds are the AH\n\nYTA", "Well hello! I also grew up in Texas and I'm now living in Europe with the same longing for tamales! \nI'll cook the entire Thanksgiving spread and still put Sara's tamales up front and center. \n\nOP, please tell Sara we miss her over here!", "I live in Phoenix. Tamale woman and Elote man are two of my favorite people.", "This is exactly right, we\u2019ve stopped before to buy them out of the back of a pickup from a cooler, lol", "I love tamales but never buy them from randos in parking lots. Unknown kitchen cleanliness and personal hygiene of the cooks make that a hard NO!", "That would be an interesting invitation: \u201cThanksgiving at my house, Nov 23, 1pm (white people food only).\u201d", "Yeah you\u2019re ancestors not you.\n\nMy grandma makes pasteles (Puerto Rico where I\u2019m from) from scratch. She literally grew her own plantains, she made her own masa! It took days, it took 2-5 people to be able to eat it the same day. Yes I helped multiple times even if it was to put then in the fridge because she used to sell them.", "By this continent you mean Europe?", "These comments \u201cI\u2019m a Latina who makes all the tamales.\u201d Their other comments \u201cOI MATE IM A BLOKE WHO LOVES DMT\u201d", "Right?!?  No one talks about the gathering with too much food but they will talk smack for years about the one with too little food.", "The problem is always someone not bringing food. Someone putting in the effort for tamales is a blessing, they're gonna taste good I bet.", "Across from racism avenue", "Yes they do!!!", "Corn bread is made from corn meal and baked while tamales are made from masa and steamed. There's a vast difference in the secondary ingredients that also go into both too.\n\nThis is like calling a loaf of bread cake because they're both made with flour. \n\nActually that's not a good comparison because again the base ingredients are different because while both made from corn the process to get cornmeal and masa are both very different.", "Bruh you put lard, and beef broth into tamale dough when you make it for the red tamales. It literally tastes nothing like American corn bread \ud83e\udd23 not even the texture is the same\n\nHave you ever had a tamale?", "They're FANTASTIC!!!!! https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/mexican-tamales/", "I\u2019ve never made them but I\u2019ll gladly trade a pumpkin cheesecake for them. No trade backs!", "They're SO good but also so labor intensive that almost nobody in my Hispanic family makes them, and they all get bought off of someone they know's abuela or coworker or neighbor who makes them by the dozens for the holidays.", "There are places here in Houston where people line up to buy fresh tamales for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Or you know someone whose abuela makes them for sale.", "Me too! I live thousands of kilometres away and would love to try some.", "> But they\u2019re little parcels of individual filling? That sounds like so much effort!\n\nOh it's worse than that. They are parcels of seasoned cornmeal around individual filling, that is then wrapped individually in soft corn husks and steamed. The assembly is SUPER laborious.", "In Australia here they are often at the food night markets. We are having a Mexican feast night on Saturday....im hoping there will be some there! OP is uncultured", "Without a doubt. Turkey and stuffing year after year after year is just bland and boring.", "I have some in my freezer \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", " And her mother in law is also on her side against OP so maybe you should listen to your mother.YTA", "I don\u2019t eat meat and I would eat a turkey tamale just to spite this asshole. \n \nYTA", "Ah so it would be a service to toss out the bland white person seasoned food.", "OP will most likely not even try them", "SIL only wants assimilation. That's the true meaning of Thanksgiving afterall.", "Jesus I didn't even realize that on my first read through... she didn't know what a tamale was. That's just sad.", "Look for any Latino market if you can. You can usually find them frozen because is a dish it takes so long to make. Also each country has its own version.", "Yeah-it's usually the chilis that defeat me. They just don't taste quite right. Masa flour I can get, but for the price I could probably do OP's whole Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nI miss the tamale truck that we always went to. The line was UNREAL, no matter what time you went, no matter what day. And now I am craving tamales....", "\"Dish must include mayo, canned soup, or marshmallows.\"", "Salt only. But not too much, it shouldn\u2019t be spicy", "My bet is they have never made mexican tamales rojos before either.\n\nKneading the masa alone is tiring. Then you got your meat that you boil, then clean, remove the bones, shred it. You got your chiles that you boil, remove stems, blend to make your sauce, mix it in with the meat. We also peel potatos and carrots, cut them longwise to add to our filling.\n\nThe corn husks have to be soaked before you spread the masa and add the filling, fold and place to steam.\n\nWhen we make tamales we make tamales. It's not just one tamale, it's always so many freaking tamales lol.", "Please see my other reply.", "It's the same concept....bruh. You can roast, boil, fry or bake potatoes, but they're still potatoes.", "Absolutely! If anyone is thinking of doing them, it's very important to have corn flour that has gone through nixtamalizaci\u00f3n and you can try to make some tamales de cazuela, since they aren't individually wrapped and still taste delicious if done roght", "Ooohhh, THANK YOU!!!", "Oh now, that sounds interesting. My speciality is cherry and coconut muffins but I'd happily make pumpkin cheesecake ...", "OP can gnaw on it and seethe.", "Sadly, you are probably right. On the bright side, that\u2019s more for everyone else! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f", "If she did, she'd def bite the husk", "Even though they will look and smell delicious\u2026just for spite SIL will pile more green bean casserole on her trying to hide the fact that she\u2019s salivating over the aroma of hot tamales\u2026", "For immigrants assimilating to local customs orrrrrrr... \ud83d\ude2c", "Same I had to go back and see OP called it \"some random dish that she made up.\"", "I couldnt handle the lack of spice \ud83d\ude2d", "I did and that's incredibly stupid. That's like saying a ravioli is the same as an Oreo because they're both made with flour and they even have a filling.\n\nIt's almost as if the cooking process transforms basic ingredients into vastly different foods that are in no what the same. The cooking process also includes the process to make basic ingredients like the different flours and spices. A paprika pepper is different from the paprika powder and will affect the foods and how they're used.", "And mashed potatos arent French fries\n\nBruh.", "If you feel like slinging a recipe for those muffins \u2026 they sound delicious", "I totally misphrased this. I meant OP wanted assimilation from SIL.", "How do you know she is an immigrant. Lots of people of Mexican descent are born in this country.", "It's not incredibly stupid at all. This entire thread is ridiculous. White women dictating to a Latin woman on what tamale is and how it should be made.", "Still potato and you definitely don't need to add lard or beef broth to masa for tamale. Please don't try to reeducate me.", "oh no I got what you meant and agree, I was just continuing on the \"true meaning of thanksgiving\" train.", "Latin where \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I'm Mexican and you're trying to tell me traditional mexican tamales rojos don't have lard or broth in the masa\n\nAlso why do you keep saying you're \"Latin\" instead of saying your hispanic origin.\n\nAre you cuban? Mexican? Dominican?", "You are a dude from the U.K.", "Says the person who claims, in previous comments, to be a Jew living in the UK. \n\nIn case you haven\u2019t realised: the more you lie, the harder it is to keep track of all your lies.", "Traditional Mexican tamales are made with lard (manteca), or vegetable shortening. For the red ones we add the broth from the filling to the dough.\n\nGet educated in the first place \n\nNo one said you have to do anything but that is how they're made traditionally.\n\nHow about you make tamale dough and a cornbread and compare how vastly different they taste. Because you're on something right now saying they're the same.", "More along the lines of make the brown people assimilate. It's what our country was founded on.", "They are a dude from the U.K.", "There is nothing \"traditional\" about that at all. Just a modern bastardized recipe."]}
