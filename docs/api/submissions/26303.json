Why didn\u2019t she feel like she could tell you? Maybe because she knew you, her dad and her brothers would make her uncomfortable?\n\n4 people bombarding her with questions about marriage and moving in has nothing to do with your mother-daughter relationship.

Whatever this \u201cconfirmation\u201d is that you\u2019ve received about them dating, it sounds like bullshit rumor.\n\nAll that aside though, here\u2019s the only important part. Your daughter came to you visibly frustrated and upset, then asked you to stop saying that her and T were dating.\n\nYou acknowledged that frustration and knew she was upset. You then chose to do the exact thing she asked you not to do and accused her of lying. That makes you the asshole.

They might just be casually seeing eachother and don't want to label it as a relationship.\n2. They might **actually** just be friends\n3.

Maybe reflect on the potential reasons why she doesn't want to tell you and fix it instead of pressuring her to be more open with you.\n\nEdit: Just noticed OP's username, I think I have a pretty good idea why she doesn't want an open line of communication with you, get a grip before she starts resenting you and just cuts you off entirely, I would certainly contemplate it if I was her.", "YTA.  This kind of fake support is perhaps why she doesn't feel she can be honest with you.   \n\n\nOr, maybe she **is** being honest, and you're believing gossip above her.  \n\n\nIn either case, you've found a great way to drive a wedge between you.", "YTA\n\nWhen I was in middle school, a number of my friends were under the impression I was dating my best friend.

That basically just tells her that you can't respect her boundaries and that you aren't someone she should trust.\n\n\n\nAlso, she's bringing him to family dinners, spending a lot of time with him, etc. It honestly seems like the fact that they aren't dating is a strong possibility....because it's not like she's sneaking around. It's just that everyone who sees them liked to gossip because they can't wrap their head around a strong platonic friendship of opposite genders.\n\n\n\nThere was an episode of Sex and the City where one of them was dating a guy and thought he might be gay.

If that's the case, stop talking about if they're dating, so they won't need to deny it.\n\nAccept that there is one little thing your daughter doesn't want to admit to, and then move on. If they really are dating, your daughter will admit that when she's ready to. Trying to demand that she admit it is just gonna make her *not* want to admit it.", "YTA.\n\nI get the feeling that there\u2019s a good reason why she\u2019s denying it to you, if she indeed is dating T.\n\nShe\u2019s an adult.

And instead of solving that constructively, you lash out at her over your own insecurity. I don't really see what you expected her to do here, after years of 'lying'. \n\nHave you ever considered your daughter may not want you to know? And that it's her good right as an adult to choose her secrets and her truths? Can you honestly say you have never lied to your daughter?\n\nAll in all, you are ruining things for yourself.

We would get lunch almost every day together or if either of us was getting food we would offer to grab something for the other.

I blew up on more than one person because my bestie was too nice (and avoided confrontation) to say anything or call them out. \n\nI understand where your daughter might be coming from because that shit was so irritating and tiring.

Look, you keep saying that if she's not really with this guy then she's in an unhealthy relationship. If that's true, well, that sucks but *A LOT* of people go through that as they grow up.
