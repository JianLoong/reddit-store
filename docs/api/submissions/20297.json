I didn't specify a budget at that moment, but I had in mind something between $50-100. She seemed excited about it initially, but things took an unexpected turn.\n\nOut of the blue, my girlfriend changed her mind and expressed her desire to buy perfume and makeup instead. I was fine with it, thinking it would still be within a reasonable price range. However, when the bill finally arrived, it totaled $200! I was completely caught off guard by the price, as it was way above what I had anticipated.\n\nNot knowing how to react, I hesitated and didn't pay for it. I walked away, pretending to browse at other stuff. Now, my girlfriend is really upset with me for not covering the entire cost, however I did pay back the lipstick portion at $40.\n\nHere's where I'm questioning if I messed up. I've always been the one to buy things for my girlfriend and pay for all our dates. However, this purchase went significantly over my budget, and I wasn't prepared for it. I'm starting to wonder if I should have just paid for it without question, but it genuinely felt unreasonable at the time.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation?
