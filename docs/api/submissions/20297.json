I'm feeling a bit conflicted and would appreciate some unbiased opinions.\n\nSo, my girlfriend and I were at the mall yesterday when I suggested that I would like to buy her a dress as a surprise gift. I didn't specify a budget at that moment, but I had in mind something between $50-100. She seemed excited about it initially, but things took an unexpected turn.\n\nOut of the blue, my girlfriend changed her mind and expressed her desire to buy perfume and makeup instead. I was fine with it, thinking it would still be within a reasonable price range. However, when the bill finally arrived, it totaled $200! I was completely caught off guard by the price, as it was way above what I had anticipated.\n\nNot knowing how to react, I hesitated and didn't pay for it. I walked away, pretending to browse at other stuff. Now, my girlfriend is really upset with me for not covering the entire cost, however I did pay back the lipstick portion at $40.\n\nHere's where I'm questioning if I messed up. I've always been the one to buy things for my girlfriend and pay for all our dates. However, this purchase went significantly over my budget, and I wasn't prepared for it. I'm starting to wonder if I should have just paid for it without question, but it genuinely felt unreasonable at the time.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation? Should I have handled it differently? I'm open to your thoughts and any advice you might have.", "created_utc": 1687408808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ftiv5/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_girlfriends/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How did you not mention to her that what she picked was out of your budget before you were at the cash register? Makeup isn\u2019t market price, there are prices on the shelves.

Just make sure it's not more than 100$.\"\nI understand why you wouldn't mention that.\n\nHer buying makeup for 200$ knowing you will pay is just nuts.\nYou two should sit down and discuss finances. Its not fair that you have to pay for everything. She does not seem to care about how much you spend. Maybe she likes having someone else pay for her stuff.\nIt's just pretty rude to pick items worth so much knowing someone else will pay. Makes it seem like she is only in for the money.", "NTA! She took advantage of a generous offer. She\u2019s an adult and is capable of communicating the cost of her items and asking if he\u2019s ok with that.

First, you offered a dress. She changed that. She also decided to buy multiple items rather than just one. Yes, you should have communicated the budget, but she apparently tried to take advantage of you to a really ridiculous extent.\n\nDon't make similar offers to her, as you know it will result in pain for both of you. Maybe you two need a discussion about financial priorities (if you're in a relatively serious or longer-term relationship) or a big step back from purchasing gifts (if you're not).", "NTA\n\nBut, this clearly was not handled well by either of you.\n\nYou should set a limit upfront -- I'd like to treat you to a dress costing up to $100.\n\nShe seems a bit greedy. I think if she'd picked a dress it would have been $200, too.", "NTA, you shouldnt state a budget and non of that.

She should also not take the mickey like this, who takes advantage with that amount", "Also 50-100 for a casual dress, maybe. \n\nAs a specific gift (implying it\u2019s something generous)\u2026 200 is not crazy.\n\nIf you\u2019re a guy who doesn\u2019t know how much things like this cost, I can see where you felt like you were being deliberately used when she picked out 200 bucks\u2019 worth of makeup. Maybe even (and this is a stretch) enough that you\u2019d rather just leave then confront her. Also if you wanted the gift to be a dress, it is a little tacky to ask for something different, but at least it would be something she wants.\n\nBut I can also see where she thought she picked out a reasonable equivalent, and that she probably felt embarrassed and abandoned when you just\u2026 fled the store without saying anything to her. \n\nYou should have communicated more before AND during. You should have set a budget. Simply walking away was extremely immature.", "I don't think he was an asshole for not wanting to pay, but he said nothing and walked away??? Is he 13?", "ESH honestly. Who makes someone else pay 200$ for them as a gift. 200$ for makeup and perfume is ridiculous too. Also, she should have showed him whatever she's picking.", "I don't agree with those comments either.\n\nI'm getting on in years and I haven't a clue how much make up etc. costs.  About the only clue on costs is for perfume and cologne - and damn is that expensive!", "\u201cI would love to buy you something nice. I have a $100- is there something here you would like?\u201d Totally fine. I would be happy. Intentionally not communicating because it\u2019s less romantic is dumb. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "He never told her the price to spend on the dress.  He needs to communicate better.", "Agreed. Also, assuming they were in a Sephora or something similar, $200 on perfume and makeup could easily be two or three items. I feel like a lot of non-makeup wearers are reading that she wanted to spend $200 and are assuming she went wild and filled up a basket.", "$200 for makeup AND perfume isn\u2019t even approaching ridiculous in the current market.", "$200 isn't a big haul of makeup and perfume - especially perfume. And it's quite reasonable as a swap for a decent dress.\n\nRemember this was ALL his idea.", "My son wanted to buy me perfume for my birthday.  A very small bottle was almost 100.  I told him no, he's a teenager.  So that plus makeup would definitely be in the 200 range.", "> Also, she should have showed him whatever she's picking\n\nShe might have tried, but dude dipped", "I would also prefer if my partner states the price range but some people are uncomfortable about it. \nThats why they definitely need to talk about finances.", "He offered to buy her the dress. She took it upon herself to decide to restock her makeup cabinet instead without clarifying his budget. She ASSumed he would  pay whatever", "That is literally one of the SMALLEST bottles of perfume and maybe two makeup products tops. \n\nPerfume - $100 ; lipstick - $20 , mascara $25 plus tax you\u2019re reaching $200 quick", "$200 in makeup and perfume isn\u2019t \u201crestocking her makeup cabinet.\u201d That\u2019s like. A very small bottle of perfume, a lipstick, and a mascara or something similar. She asked if instead of a dress she could get perfume and make up, something she probably would use more than the dress anyway. \n\nDude should\u2019ve communicated his budget with her upfront.", "Exactly! And he said yes and the just walked away and ignored her?? Wtf. Specify a budget or don\u2019t agree when she asked if she could buy perfume and makeup instead . OP didn\u2019t say that he was expecting it to cost 50-100. If he did and then she went over budget, it would have been shitty of her, but he never said!! She probably thought she was being reasonable, considering how much perfume and makeup actually costs"]}
