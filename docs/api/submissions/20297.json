I didn't specify a budget at that moment, but I had in mind something between $50-100. She seemed excited about it initially, but things took an unexpected turn.\n\nOut of the blue, my girlfriend changed her mind and expressed her desire to buy perfume and makeup instead. I was fine with it, thinking it would still be within a reasonable price range. However, when the bill finally arrived, it totaled $200! I was completely caught off guard by the price, as it was way above what I had anticipated.\n\nNot knowing how to react, I hesitated and didn't pay for it. I walked away, pretending to browse at other stuff. Now, my girlfriend is really upset with me for not covering the entire cost, however I did pay back the lipstick portion at $40.\n\nHere's where I'm questioning if I messed up. I've always been the one to buy things for my girlfriend and pay for all our dates. However, this purchase went significantly over my budget, and I wasn't prepared for it. I'm starting to wonder if I should have just paid for it without question, but it genuinely felt unreasonable at the time.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation?

If she decided to buy $1500 Loubitians instead, would that be acceptable?", "Typically, when someone offers to buy you something as a gift you ask if their good with the cost of the items before going to the till", "It\u2019s nearly E S H \n\nBut come on. You thought a dress would be $40? \n\nYou just walked away awkwardly? \n\nWhat?!\n\nYTA. All you had to say: Babe my budget is around x.", "NTA but honey you need to be aware of prices - 100 for a dress isn\u2019t much at all.", "Nta. You are being used for money. Ditch the drain on your resources.", "ESH.  You had a budget in mind but didn't tell her.  She thinks you want to buy her something & doesn't think about the cost bc again, you didn't tell her.  BUT, just bc she didn't know the budget, doesn't mean she has to get greedy.  She could've asked you how much you were willing to spend.  So again, ESH. But, YTA for walking away when it was time to pay without an explanation.", "YTA but only slightly. I only gave that title because you walked off and forced your GF to pay while only comping a $40 lipstick. \n\nWhat you should have done (IMO) is when she decided to get perfume and makeup, you could have spoken up and said \"Okay, but I only have around $100 to spend, so go easy.\" You'd still buy her a surprise gift, she gets what she wants, and no arguments (unless she gets mad at the amount).", "ESH. Always be specific about the amount of money you intend to spend. A d she needed to tell you what each item cost before she put it in her basket. You need to realize that perfume alone is often over a hundred dollars. Mine is.", "YTA\n\nNever go to the mall with a woman anywhere outside the food court or the movie theatres, and definitely never offer a woman to go shopping on your dime.\n\nYou're lucky it was only 200 dollars!\n\nSave your kindness for gifts that YOU choose and buy, for example birthdays, anniversary etc\n\nYou've learned a life lesson my friend.", "NTA", "ESH. You are both wrong here. You should have set the budget, or she should have asked how much you were looking to spend. If you get to the register without knowing the total, and it\u2019s far more than you expected, you need to man up and say I\u2019m sorry, my budget is only $100 and then she could\u2019ve chosen whether she wanted to spend the additional money for all of the items.  You need to sit down with your girlfriend and have a discussion about how this will happen in the future.", "A gift card would have solved ALL the problems.\n\nHonestly, I don't think you know anything about dresses or make-up - dude, a basic freaking *bra* that actually fits can cost $200.\n\nNAH, but a lot of ignorance about the economics of being female on OP's side.", "YTA. Do you not know how to pronounce dollar amounts? You could have set a budget. You also could have said at the register, \"this is more than I wanted to spend.\" instead of just walking away. She could have checked in at least before the register. I have to guess though that she also did not know how much it would ring up and just grabbed what was a reasonable (to her) makeup purchase. It kind of sounds like you offered a \"gift\" but put all of the work of budgeting and shopping within the budget on her because you don't know how to do it.\n\nIf she bought the rest, she wasn't trying to get your money, she's just annoyed that you undercommunicated and avoided confrontation, which are both very disfunctional behaviors in a relationship.", "YTAH.  Your mouth wrote a check that your butt couldn\u2019t cash. That\u2019s kind of arrogant or ignorant probably a little of both.\n\nHere\u2019s the really weird part. You went shopping with her in the store together and didn\u2019t look at any prices????? or anything in the store what the hell?????\n\nThis is a really really good lesson I hope that it makes you think first and check things before you speak. \nYou should\u2019ve paid for it flat out and apologized for your reaction because yes you were shocked, just say so, you had no idea what you got yourself into. Lesson learned move on. \nBut you definitely should\u2019ve paid.", "Yea that ulta for ya", "NTA, but you should've told her that was out of your budget immediately. You are very generous w picking up the tab when you go out.", "If you offer to buy a gift and don't specify a price range, that's on you. Since you didn't and she bought herself something supposedly \"on you\" - you should have taken it as a life lesson, let her know that that was a little larger of a price tag than you'd had in mind,  paid the bill, and made a mental note not to ever \"hand her your credit card\" in the future.  YTA, but mitigated.", "ESH, both of you needed to communicate.\n\n>Not knowing how to react, I hesitated and didn't pay for it. I walked away, pretending to browse at other stuff. \n\nThis bit is not cool, you should have stayed there and said hey I'm really sorry for not specifying an amount but I'm only okay paying half of that - do you want to put some of it back, or are you happy to pay the other half?", "ESH. She went overboard. You need to learn to use your words.", "ESH \n\nWho would just expect someone to pay for 200 in shopping? \nWhy didn\u2019t you set a budget?", "She probably knew that the make up and perfume are MUCH more expensive and decided to get more of him.", "My initial thought was \"where can you get a dress worth being a gift for $50-100?\" And then I thought \"probably Forever 21\"", "She did not handle things the way I would have. But I tend to overcommunicate basically everything. She made assumptions, but not in a way that made her TA. She clearly was fine with him just buying a lipstick or whatever if he had just said that in the beginning.", "Who \u201cmade\u201d him? He offered lol.", "Much more expensive than what? He never set a budget for the dress. Dresses can easily cost as much.", "\u201cI realized I\u2019m really bad at communicating, really need to work on that.\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019re fully aware that this was caused by your poor communication skills. So WHY are you here??? You know what the problem is. Get off reddit and go fix it.", "/r/AmITheEx", "Agreed.  I can spend $200 at Sephora on three or four things.  Good makeup and skincare isn\u2019t cheap.", "There's plenty of lovely dresses under $100 that aren't specifically aimed at younger people.", "After he saw the total not while she was shopping", "Shopping spree at Sephora can be easily over 2k lol", "50 buys you plenty nice though. Usually buy at hollister and never went over 99 for something nice.", "Still, it's absolutely ridiculous. Make up isn't made of gold... usually.", "You want me to think this dude was walking around sephora by himself while his girlfriend was shopping?", "200$ is nothing these days.  I paid 60$ at airport for 1 beer and quesadilla", "No? I\u2019m saying he only dipped when he saw the total of her purchase and assume he was with her while she was picking everything out", "He offered a dress (1x item). She asked for some makeup/perfume. He said, sure. She, actively saw all of the prices of what she wanted. She declined to mention those prices to Op. she gets to the till and is shocked when it doesn\u2019t go her way. He was never obligated to spend above what he planned on spending for the dress. As per op, $50 was the minimum. He threw down $40, close enough. She should be happy she didn\u2019t have to spend all of her own money.", "She should be grateful that she got anything"]}
