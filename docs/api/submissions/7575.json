She probably doesn't like you either so just leave her alone.", "YTA and you also sound very annoying.", "A little life lesson- if your classmates talk about her, they also talk about you. \n\nYou\u2019re not better for thinking you\u2019re the only one capable of telling her \u201cthe whole class doesn\u2019t like her\u201d, you\u2019re being set up to be the scapegoat for an immature collective consciousness of teens.  You don\u2019t sound mature enough to know how to give constructive criticism yet. You want her to what, change? And why? She\u2019s not a problem. Being a bully is a problem.

They might not have parents they can talk to about them.  Sometimes it's good to get a different opinion than a parent who might think their child is perfect.  Some people talk to their parents about issues at school.  It's not an issue.

If you guys pushed her out it\u2019s understandable that she sought companionship and understanding elsewhere. \n\nYou should probably take the time to reflect on why you feel the need to put Laia in her place, so to speak.

Am I missing anything? YTA.", "YTA just straight up telling people you don't like them is rude and damaging.  I don't think you're mature enough yet on how to provide constructive criticism.

You seem to have zero self awareness. \n\nIf the world is calling you a bully, maybe take a step back and assess the situation yourself but from a new perspective; a new point of view will help you out of this hole you\u2019ve dug.", "YTA. Stop bullying the new kid because she tries in class. Straight up, you sound exhausting. Focus on your own life and your own schoolwork and your own grades. For everyone's sake", "Yikes.

I recommend you engage in a bit of self reflection and do better.", "Look, if you really genuinely want to adress the situation, there are several things you need to consider.\n\nFirst, consider for yourself, what are you actually trying to get out of this? Do you want her to stop having good grades? To stop talking to her parents(who happen to be teachers)? Do you just want her to shut up in class and never talk to you guys? None of those are good reasons, and talking to her is not going to work. Or do you perhaps genuinely think that your class would be a nicer place if you, your friends, and her where all nicer to each other, and want to try to make the best of the year(s) you're going to spend together?\n\nIf you are serious about that last question, and you genuinely want to change how you and her interact, you will need to do some serious introspection first. In your post you are talking about her behavior that annoys you. But take the time to consider for yourself, what kind of behavior have you and your classmates done that have annoyed her? Did you make jokes? laugh at her? \n\nTake care to consider it from her perspective as well. Perhaps she corrected you on something and you called her 'smartypants' in return? While you might argue that *she* started it by correcting you, from her perspective she tried to help and got called a name. \n\nOnce you have figured out what kind of things you could have done differently, and you genuinely want to try and have a better relationship with her, you can try the following.\n\n---\n\nFirst off, start by apologizing about how you and her are not really getting along, and explain that you would really like to start over, and try to be nicer to eachother. \n\nThen, give a genuine apology about the things you think may have hurt her, and the general way you and your friends have acted to her. And at that point, wait for her response.\n\nAt this point, she can accept or reject your apology. This apology will not automatically make things right, and it may very well be that she has no desire for an apology, or will even walk way.\n\nImportantly, though, don't bring up any 'issues' you have with her yet. If you're going to say \"i apologize, now you apologize for all the things we think you did wrong\", you're never going to get an answer you like. \n\nIf you're lucky, she will genuinely want to try to start over, and she may even apologize for how she acted to you guys. However, more likely is that she genuinely doesn't feel she did anything wrong. At that point, how you should approach that is never by saying that she was wrong. Rather, keep it about your own feelings.\n\nYou can, for example, say something like \"when you correct me on an answer, it makes me feel like you know everything better than me\". This makes it about *your feelings*, rather than about *her actions*.\n\n---\n\nI do hope that you guys find a way to get along better, but part of me thinks that you just want her to shut up because you don't like her. If that is your reason for wanting to talk to her, you're not going to find success. Only if you genuinely regret how things are going, and really want to try and have a better relationship(and perhaps, in the future, even a friendship?) with her, then you have a chance by trying to change.
