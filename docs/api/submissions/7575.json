I recommend you engage in a bit of self reflection and do better.", "Look, if you really genuinely want to adress the situation, there are several things you need to consider.\n\nFirst, consider for yourself, what are you actually trying to get out of this? Do you want her to stop having good grades? To stop talking to her parents(who happen to be teachers)? Do you just want her to shut up in class and never talk to you guys? None of those are good reasons, and talking to her is not going to work. Or do you perhaps genuinely think that your class would be a nicer place if you, your friends, and her where all nicer to each other, and want to try to make the best of the year(s) you're going to spend together?\n\nIf you are serious about that last question, and you genuinely want to change how you and her interact, you will need to do some serious introspection first. In your post you are talking about her behavior that annoys you. But take the time to consider for yourself, what kind of behavior have you and your classmates done that have annoyed her? Did you make jokes? laugh at her? \n\nTake care to consider it from her perspective as well. Perhaps she corrected you on something and you called her 'smartypants' in return? While you might argue that *she* started it by correcting you, from her perspective she tried to help and got called a name. \n\nOnce you have figured out what kind of things you could have done differently, and you genuinely want to try and have a better relationship with her, you can try the following.\n\n---\n\nFirst off, start by apologizing about how you and her are not really getting along, and explain that you would really like to start over, and try to be nicer to eachother. \n\nThen, give a genuine apology about the things you think may have hurt her, and the general way you and your friends have acted to her. And at that point, wait for her response.\n\nAt this point, she can accept or reject your apology. This apology will not automatically make things right, and it may very well be that she has no desire for an apology, or will even walk way.\n\nImportantly, though, don't bring up any 'issues' you have with her yet. If you're going to say \"i apologize, now you apologize for all the things we think you did wrong\", you're never going to get an answer you like. \n\nIf you're lucky, she will genuinely want to try to start over, and she may even apologize for how she acted to you guys. However, more likely is that she genuinely doesn't feel she did anything wrong. At that point, how you should approach that is never by saying that she was wrong. Rather, keep it about your own feelings.\n\nYou can, for example, say something like \"when you correct me on an answer, it makes me feel like you know everything better than me\". This makes it about *your feelings*, rather than about *her actions*.\n\n---\n\nI do hope that you guys find a way to get along better, but part of me thinks that you just want her to shut up because you don't like her. If that is your reason for wanting to talk to her, you're not going to find success. Only if you genuinely regret how things are going, and really want to try and have a better relationship(and perhaps, in the future, even a friendship?) with her, then you have a chance by trying to change.

You seem to be bullying her unnecessarily just because you find her annoying (which isn\u2019t a crime and not an excuse to bully). She is kind of an AH for trying to get the teachers against you and using her influence as the daughter of another teacher as a weapon against you. I can somewhat get how that may seem unfair to you. However, if YOU were a new kid who was being bullied, wouldn\u2019t you use whatever resources you had to protect yourself? You sort of set yourself up for this because you made her feel like a target from day one. \n\nThe best thing you can do moving forward is to interact with her as little as possible and when you do need to be civil and kind. In other words, be the bigger person. Don\u2019t be snarky, don\u2019t roll your eyes, don\u2019t make snide comments, and don\u2019t try and turn people against her over trivial bs.

What are you going to do? Bully and harass them? Try and turn all your other co-workers against them? That\u2019s not how life in the real world works, and you are only a few years away from having to deal with that reality. Plenty of immature adults *try* that route, but it RARELY works out well in the long run.

And I joined from the sidelines, happy that I wasn't the target for once.\n\nTeachers tried to reason with us, but we were taking every behaviour of his as an insult to us. And there was nothing he could do to redeem himself in our eyes. He spoke to teachers and we hated him for it. His mother came to school to protect him and we blamed it for him. No-one was nice to him, ever.\n\nEventually, one of the older kids befriended him and protected him from us. I couldn't understand it. Couldn't he see how much the other guy sucked? And yet, the kid was so happy about having a friend.\n\nToday I'm much older, and my behaviour then is one of my most embarrassing and regretful memories. Even if I understand I was young, and he probably doesn't remember me at all (as he shouldn't) the regret and shame sticks to me.\n\nSo yeah.

Maybe say \"huh\". And go back to what's important. Maybe say your mantra if your brain picks it up & dwells on her.

You can say it outright; \"I don't speak about others behind their backs.\" & leave if you don't hear some apologies & turns of conversation.

Go get yourself some of that. Be abundant. Surround yourself with abundant people, abundant thought, abundant effort. Stop wading thru the lack as if it is your penance. \n\nMake up your mind right now to climb out of this shit. Just flip the switch. Turn the corner. Meet moments of weakness with your mantra.

When your writing is a hot mess, your message gets lost because your reader is distracted by poor punctuation, missing spaces, random stops and starts, and laziness. \n\nIn short: if you don't want to be viewed as \"dumb,\" don't write like a dumbass.", "Not really.", "OP also says they tried to befriend her. If someone acts like your friend, you're gonna talk to them in class which is not private anyyways.", "Sneaking suspicion that she should have used the word talked. I mean trying to talk to someone who previously pretended to be your friend is pretty standard. It\u2019s only mean because OP was mean.", "But I was an ELL partner, and if you had gone to my school we would have taught you English!", "Aww.  You deleted your stupid \"farm\" comment.  I could tell you have a disdain for people in general, but I didn't know you hated food too!\n\nBut I can tell you're the class snitch, because the only people who hated teachers like me were the bullies who needed that privileged position", "Dude, I was defending the things people are calling you out on with your use of english. Since it isn't your first language, most of the grammar and sentence structure can be excused. \n\nY still TA though.", "I didnt not delete anything so maybe you need a new pair of glasses. How can I be a snitch, if according to you a snitch likes its teacher? It'd make me a bully if any, but I dont blame you for your flawed logic, after all logic is not used that often in schools. I am past schools and I have never been a bully nor a \"kissass\", sooner I'd be bullied.", "Well it appeared and then disappeared \ud83e\udd37"]}
