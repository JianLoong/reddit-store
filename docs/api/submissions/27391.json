We were there for 6 days and it was rough. Our daughter is very energetic and it's exhausting keeping her occupied the whole day. I ended up spending a lot of hours during the day carrying her around to comfort her and get her to sleep (and then in the middle of the night when she would woke up from the pain). I was exhausted. Husband visited us everyday and would stay for 3 hours so I could get some rest, but he would make a point how he'd been working and now has to spend his afternoon in the hospital. I was annoyed bc he'd worked from home and it takes him 15 minutes to reach the hospital, so he had the whole evening to relax while I was stuck.\n\nDaughter was discharged on monday and can't go to daycare for 2 weeks, and I had a presentation on wednesday so I was overwhelmed. I told my husband about the presentation and he got annoyed and told me I should take another week off to take care of her. I told him I will think about it, I have a lot of work and I don't want to miss so much. I decided to just take tuesday off and work in the evening for the rest. I told my husband on wednesday and he was piss*d, he said that I was the AH bc I was dishonest with him about taking time off, he was counting on me and now he has care for her in the evening alone. I tried to explain that I only said I would think about the whole week and think I cared for our daughter in the hospital and am now taking care of her while trying to work evening, I only expect him to take care of her then (he isn't missing any work). We started fighting and I screamed that the only problem he has is he can't have a free evening and is being selfish. He smirked and said something like \"well the law grants me free time after work so...\" and I lost it and told him that he is a parent now for 2, 5 years and he should have realised by now he doesn't get time off when he is finished with his work bc parenting is a 24/7 job and other rude things.\n\nAdditional info: a year ago I started a new job, husband suported me by staying home if our daughter was sick, about 3 months ago he started a new job and now is my turn. I believe I had kept my end of the deals since I took the days off to be in the hospital and am also taking care of her and work in the evenings, but he thinks I shouldn't be working at all - I disagree bc he didn't have to miss any work. I also tried to explain I was hurt he didn't even acknowledged everything I did and would't help me by stepping up in the evening and is thinking only about himself. He rejected that and said I was just determined to make him an AH. \nI feel like the AH for screaming, but I am also piss*d at him for dismissing me and being so selfish.", "created_utc": 1695380070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p76cu/aita_for_expecting_my_husband_to_take_care_of_our/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Neglect is illegal.", "Hello, thank you for taking the time to respond. So, I wanted to clarify this a bit. I don't think he holds 1950's wife ideal, normally we split all our responsibilities as  evenly as possible, he had also decided to take reduced working hours when I started my new job, that was sort of a comprise because I was on maternity leave for a year and a half. So he picks our daughter up and takes care of her alone until I get home (and he is great at that and they have incredible connection). That being sad, I don't know how to explain this, I think he has a habit of first thinking \"how will this affect me\" and has trouble understanding that with a toddler sometimes you just don't get a break and it sucks, but it is what it is. I don't know I would say maybe he is immature and insensitive in some regards? I think some things also don't come naturally to him because he didn't have great role models at home.\nAlso I know we both have poor communication skills, I get super triggered when I am trying to explain why something he did/or said hurt me, and he just gets defensive and dismissive or tries to shift the blame. We also leave in a foreign country and have no family support so we are both overwhelmed most of the time.", ">You make things sound like it's a chore for you and your husband to look after your own kid. You're both very career oriented and sounds to me like a kid doesn't really fit your lifestyle.\n\n\nFuck that. OP just took a week off work, and hubby won't even cover the evening shift so she can catch up. Only one of them is shirking parental responsibility.", "I live in a very equal relationship. But I can relate to what you describe with his first thought \"how does this affect me\". \n\nMy thought is always first \"how will this affect the child\". His is first himself, then the child. Not that he is a bad parent but it is something I have noticed and that makes me super pissed off sometimes. \n\nHe jokes \"it is like in the safety leaflet on airplanes, help first yourself then those around you\" but I don't agree. If the child needs me, then my needs will wait. \n\nIf I want to go for a run and then shower, but the child needs extra help with homework, then I help with homework. Husband in same situation, says \"sorry I don't have time right now\" and goes for his run, even though there is no time for both run and homework. I know it is small compared to your situation. And maybe I need to work on prioritizing myself more. But I feel he behaves like this because he knows I will pick up the slack so the homework gets done, if you get how I mean?\n\nBut like your situation, things are always more complex than a short post like this. I wish you the best, and your child a quick recovery.", "Oh yes, my post had more than double the limit of characters so after editing I think some nuance might be missing. But it is like you desrcibe it! I don't think it is intentionally sexist or something, it is just what is natural for him I guess? It is not like he would leave us high and dry when in need, but he can be really self centered about the small things. Like commenting about how he is tired and he is still going to a hospital after working - it not like daughter and I are exactly enjoying ourselves over here. But he will say somthing insensitive like that and then he will be surprised that I am annoyed, because he thinks he is just making an innocent comment about his day. Also, I think people have gotten out of my post that he likes his work more than our child, but it is the other way round. He finds his work to be a chore that he just needs to do, and I think that afterwards he gets in this state of mind like \"this chore is now behind me, so I should be rewarded with some me time\" (which is legit and I also feel the similar, it is just no realistic when you are a parent). I think it burdens him, for example if friends suggest they meet up sunday evening, he will say he can't because he need to prepare (mentaly I guess) for work. Which is all fine, but after you become a parent you lose that privilage and sometimes have to manage more things at once."]}
