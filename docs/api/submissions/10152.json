I work every day except Sundays and Mondays. 2 years ago, my mom (51F) abandoned me. I woke up one morning to my aunt banging on my front door, saying that my mom called her and admitted to moving away with her boyfriend.\n\nMy aunt and I called my mom frantically and when she finally answered, she told us that she never wanted to be a mom. Up until this point, my mom had been amazing. She had a good-paying job, she was on the PTA, everything. I begged her to come home but she said that she, for her mental health, couldn\u2019t do \u201cthis\u201d any longer and that since I was 15 at the time, that I could basically take care of myself. She left me about $500 but that was it. \n\nMy aunt and uncle, who is paralyzed, don\u2019t charge me anything for rent but I still felt obligated to find a job to help out. My aunt can\u2019t work because she\u2019s a full-time caregiver, so they make ends meet with my uncle\u2019s monthly disability check. My aunt refuses to take any money from me but asks me to buy household things like toiletries. Because of this, I was able to save enough money to buy a car. My pastor owns a used car lot and he slashed one of his car prices in half just so I could afford it.\n\nSince I\u2019m a senior, I usually go to my car during opportunity block (study hall) to get some sleep. I have all of the credits needed to graduate except for two core classes. Seniors who have enough credits to graduate are still required to come to school but they have opportunity blocks for studying, but most just end up in the library on the computers. Teacher and student parking lots are separate, so I was surprised when one of the 10th-grade teachers knocked on my window and told me that I couldn\u2019t sleep in my car during school hours. She said it went against safety policies.\n\nI explained that I was on opportunity block but she told me that I needed to be inside. I did what she told me to do to avoid an argument, but the next day I went back to my car. I laid the seat flat so but she still found me. She told me that if she saw me in my car again, that she was going to have me written up. I told her that I worked and that I would only end up going to sleep in the library. She got mad. She called me insubordinate and told me that she was going to get security because I wouldn\u2019t listen to her. I called her a Karen because she yelled and demanded things of me when I wasn\u2019t bothering anyone.\n\nI ended up in the office, and the principal said that he was surprised by my attitude but asked me to apologize. I told him no, because I had done nothing wrong. He said that if I won\u2019t apologize that I\u2019d be sent to ISS for the week, which is where I am now. Surprisingly no one called my aunt to tell her what happened. My uncle has a pretty bad bedsore, so she\u2019s really stressed about that so I kept this to myself. I spoke with my pastor. He says he sees where I\u2019m coming from but still thinks I should apologize but I refuse.

You aren\u2019t doing any favors to yourself by not following the rules or apologizing. You are in your senior year.

The goal is to graduate from high school not to make a point. Sometimes you just have to do what is needed to get what you want. That is part of adulthood.", "INFO: Were you refusing to go inside?  Or were you cooperating, but mouthing off?", "> I had done nothing wrong. \n\nYou broke a *very* reasonable rule, and then argued with an authority figure who was doing exactly what she should be doing. *Then* you broke the rule again.

Unless you had some specific permission from the principal to sleep in your car, you were out of line. \n\nAs far as the safety thing goes, perhaps you have forgotten the numerous school shootings throughout the country? A student going to their car is unfortunately, a concern. Obviously it's not what your plan was, but take a moment and look at it from a different perspective. \n\nApologize and graduate.", "I get why you're sleeping in your car - your context and story are solid. But the unfortunate reality is that if you were breaking a safety rule, you kinda just have to deal. You're a minor and \"at school.\" Unfortunately these days knowing where everyone is on campus is a big safety concern so that they can account for everyone in an emergency - like a lockdown or other similar type thing. \n\nI'm a salaried adult who can leave work whenever I want with no issues, but we tell our office when we're leaving the site just so they know how many people to rescue if there's an emergency. \n\nBottom line is that you're in the go-along-to-get along situation just a bit longer.

You will need to learn to choose your battles very soon and this is a good example of it.", "Soft YTA on this one, it's a stupid rule but the school could be held accountable if some final destination shit happened to you in your car", "Reluctant ESH. I can understand why you're not allowed to sleep in your car on school property, things could go wrong on a cold or hot day, etc.  That said, when kids are going hungry due to family circumstances, schools provide meals; why, then, are the teacher and principal not trying harder to address your obvious lack of sleep? They're not AHs for enforcing rules, but for focusing on the teacher's hurt feelings instead of your problems.", "NTA: However, play their game and apologize. You\u2019re so close to finishing high school it\u2019s not worth making waves on your way out. Nap in the library for now, and if anyone gives you shit go to the nurse\u2019s office and ask if you can nap there.", "I have to say YTA even though I wish I didn't. You had to grow up fast and without a mom and are trying super hard not to be a burden. But, part of growth is knowing we have to follow stupid rules. I'm sure, as others have noted, it's a safety issue. Appologize, go the library and sleep.", "ESH.\n\nYou shouldn't have called her a Karen. She was only following protocols. If something happens to you while you are in your car, the school will be rightfully held responsible. You're still a minor. But the teacher shouldn't have started yelling or gotten mad with you. The best thing to do was to call security and have you escorted inside. I work at a Dollar Tree and I tell people all the time, you don't have to be rude to communicate effectively.\n\nETA: Also, it's dumb for schools to require kids to still come to school outside of the classes that they need when they're about to graduate. I'm only a few years past graduation myself and when I was a senior, we could come for the classes we needed and then go home. The school district actually preferred it this way.

In a case like this one, educators should be more open minded.", "YTA. You are a minor and they are responsible for your safety in that lot. You can't sleep in the vehicle. \n\n\nAlso, you're not really an asshole. All teenagers are shitty. You are just normal", "Another instance of schools believing in forced apologies. **NTA**, but petty name-calling doesn't exactly help the case. Just refuse and say nothing else.", "NTA - Please never apologize when your not sorry.  It only makes things worse and she only wants this to humiliate you.", "YTA.

If someone else found out she caught you and said nothing, her job could be in jeopardy.  I get your point too, but it is her job and livelihood on the line vs your comfort. You have to be sneakier or ask for permission in this case. I slept a lot in school. Some teacher don't care, especially if you have your credits. I would maybe try to apologize to this teacher, explain your living/work situation and see if there is a safe place you could maybe nap for your opportunity period. If there isn't, find a better place to nap, but don't begrudge anyone who catches you.", "Sometimes you have to apologise, even if you weren't in the wrong. \n\nJust do it.  You don't have to mean it.  Don't make your life any more difficult than it already is.  \n\nESH", "I really want to say N-A-H because I know you are going through a lot and it's hard to be your best self when lacking sleep, but the school rules are for your safety and your teacher needed to enforce them. YWBTA if you didn't apologize.\n\nMaybe if you apologize you can get an accommodation to sleep somewhere during your study block. Your principle was surprised by your behaviour so it seems they know you're a good kid in general. Sorry for your situation.", "NTA. She was a busybody and deserved the name you gave her.", "Hesitant ESH because I don't think you did any of it intentionally to be an AH, and I think the teachers + staff are failing to miss the fact that a student sleeping during school hours usually has something going on at home.\n\nIt is very unsafe to sleep in your car, especially at a school these days.\n\nThe best case imo is to apologize to the teacher for calling her a Karen and say that it was unwarranted- it was. \n\nAfter that I would talk to your school nurse if you know them already and if they're fairly kind and lenient. If you explain that you work a lot, they might let you rest there. I don't know if you see a therapist at all for what happened at your mom, but if you can do so for free from insurance I would like to recommend it, not only because it could help you in the long run to prevent outburts towards authority (which is very common with kids who were abandoned by parents) but you also may be able to get a written slip for accommodation to give to administration that allows you to rest in the nurse's office if they had an issue with that too.", "Yeah, apologize. \"I'm sorry my mom left me and I have to work to pay for my necessities and help my aunt & disabled uncle while I'm still in high school. I'm sorry that going to school and working as much as I do leaves me so little time to sleep that I end up napping whenever I can. I'm sorry that no one at this school cares about what a tough spot I'm in  and are more interested in rules than in what is actually happening to me.\" \n\n Maybe your apology has to be more diplomatic than that to do any good, but that's what I've got.\n\nNTA. Here's a sincere I'm sorry statement: OP, I'm sorry that so many of the adults in your life have let you down so badly. You're doing the best you can in very tough circumstances.

I usually just ended up going home though. But if I remember correctly, there was a process for signing yourself out. Upper classmen were also allowed to leave for lunch. As some people mentioned, it\u2019s important for your school to know if you\u2019re there or not in case there\u2019s an emergency. But in my school, even the younger students who were skipping would be accounted for when each period teacher took attendance (if you weren\u2019t there, the admin would know and could call home and tell your parents you weren\u2019t at school). So if your school is like this, NTA for specifically leaving the building assuming you followed the correct protocol. \n\nAs for the school, NAH because I assume they have that rule about cars specifically to avoid students doing things they\u2019re legally not supposed to (like smoking marijuana or whatever). I don\u2019t really see how safety is a factor in the rule. Are they afraid you\u2019re going to get mugged or something? That seems doubtful. It\u2019s a school?\n\nPersonally, I think the teacher is TA for how she handled it. She sounds like a jerk. There are rules at my school I have to enforce that I think are stupid but I\u2019m not going to be an asshole about it. I just explain calmly the reasons for the rules and the consequences for not following them. And if a student breaks them multiple times, I just enforce the consequence. Yelling is wholly unnecessary and the sign of a person who is miserable with their life. Plus, you weren\u2019t doing anything morally wrong or hurting anyone so personally, fuck her. \n\nIn the future, I would recommend looking for a different alternative. If your car is comfy, maybe you can drive to nearby parking lot off school grounds or you can ask admin if they can accommodate you somehow (although in my experience, they\u2019re not going to try, but it can\u2019t hurt to ask).\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with a crappy school experience. The public education system is truly broken and it makes me sad to see exceptional young people get caught up in it. From what it sounds like, you\u2019re a hardworking and bright young person who has ambition and a creative mind.

YOU have real world problems and you're being forced to abide by childish/fictitious rules that don't apply to actual adult situations. I absolutely despise public schools! So much that both my kids are homeschooled and my oldest (14) is already in college. \n\nIf it were \"me\"... file for emancipation, take my GED/test out, file for FASFA, and go to college. But... you are not me... and the best advice I can give to anyone in your situation is to pick your battles. You have 2 classes left. You have more to risk than I currently do. I risked all in HS... (short version) graduated with a 1.6 GPA, scored in the top percentile of the state examinations, started my own life without any parental support, went to college (3.8GPA), and earned a 6-figure salary. \n\nYou could play their little game and apologize (live to fight another day).

I was usually a bus rider but a friend offered to drive me home. My teacher stopped me from leaving as I was walking out the door and I had to tell her that I was riding with a friend and not on the bus so they had a record of where I was and how I left school in case something happened.

They're even like this with the student-teachers that are in college who don't even go here. One of the girls who assists from a local community college got reprimanded because she left on her lunch break to get donuts. I'm just honestly tired of trying to fight city hall", "He didn't actually. He just said that there had been too many incidents of kids ordering DoorDash and we're not supposed to have outside food for lunch, so I guess that's why the teacher was patrolling the parking lot. He didn't even ask what I was doing out there. I think he was kinda busy doing something else and couldn't get the complete details of what was happening because I wasn't ordering food. I was just sleep in my car", "In the age of active gunman drills and school shootings...what your teacher did was not escalation\n\nYou may have been sleeping\n\nBut how does she know you aren't going out to your car for a weapon?\n\nIt's not fair that that is the world kids today live in...or the world that teachers find themselves trying to teach in\n\nBut that is the world we live in none the less\n\nAnd sure, she could be a cranky, beaten down teacher who just assumed you were smoking weed or something else.  But when you get caught breaking the rules, there's no need to react with aggression.  In my experience...if you are all \"yeah I know, I am sorry\" and you are calm...teachers will usually be calm in return.  Not all...but I think most.\n\nNext time you want to take a nap, go find a corner in the library, put one of your text books in your lap, and then let yourself nap.  If a teacher wakes you up, apologize for \"accidentally\" falling asleep\n\nAnd go find the teacher and apologize.\n\nBelieve it or not, teachers appreciate when you treat them like human beings and not prison guards", "The trick here was to go to someone in authority (nurse, counselor, teacher, administrator) *before* starting the routine of sleeping in your car and explain the situation.  Then ask for help solving the problem - I'm exhausted during the day, this is why, to do my best I need a nap during the day.  This would have shown respect to the school, and probably would result in a suitable solution for you.\n\nDo you have any idea how many students, teachers and staff have to deal with each day who chose to make their own rules then argue?", "OP- check in with your school nurse. When I worked at a high school we let kids sleep in the office if they had a free period so they might let you do that if they have open beds.", "I agree with the other posters here. Apologize for the ride reaction, and talk with administrators (or your counselor or the nurse) about what accommodations can be made. It's possible that you can negotiate with them to find a solution that meets school requirements *and* your need for extra sleep.\n\nI don't always feel *bad* about certain situations, but I can still apologize for my part in the conflict. It's a useful skill. It's not about apologizing just to apologizing for my behavior when I'm out of line. I may be kind of right in some situations, but I sometimes react badly. That I can apologize for pretty easily.", "I\u2019m a high school teacher. I have to enforce rules every day but I bend them when it\u2019s best for the kid. Follow the rules, just to avoid getting any grief, but I personally think your situation warrants an exception. Good luck.", "Can I ask why you don't feel bad? It's likely part of her job to enforce the safety rules, so you were belligerent and insulting to someone who's likely underpaid and just trying to do what they're supposed to while they're at work. I understand that you don't like the rules, but she probably didn't make them. \n\nWould you like it if someone came into your job, started doing something they're not supposed to do, and when you told them they aren't supposed to they started calling you names? Wouldn't you think that person is a total AH?", "Maybe apologize and say \"I get cranky when you are tired and if you could take a nap that would alleviate it?\" Just kidding... don't say that it won't help the situation at all. \n\nI would ask for the policy though.

My own son is in high school now and though not a senior, their opportunity blocks are only 20 minutes. I honestly don\u2019t see the harm in someone napping for 20 minutes during essentially a free block, especially since OP said they\u2019re still required to come to school. I\u2019m thinking since several of their classes are free blocks, then I can see the issue. They\u2019re essentially unaccounted for for a long stretch of time", "It\u2019s possible the school is not liable if the student is off campus and is liable if they\u2019re on campus property, in which case the school might only want students either supervised or off campus. Idk. My students are much younger, so they have to be somewhere with supervision and we have to know where they are in case there\u2019s an emergency or drill."]}
