They publicly humiliated you AND THEN LAUGHED IN YOUR FACE AND MOCKED YOU FURTHER AND REFUSED TO CHECK YOUR ID. \nYou are only an asshole for letting that shit slide.", "NTA. The staff SHOULD feel bad/uncomfortable because what they did was so inappropriate, rude and unprofessional. As someone who has been a server and been in a position where I thought maybe I had served someone I shouldn\u2019t have, the right thing for them to do was to ask to see your ID.", "NTA\n\nI would ask to speak to the manager's manager", "NTA you should have shoved your ID in their face. And yes, definitely complain to corporate.", "I had the same thoughts. Why did neither OP or her mom speak up? It didn't even need a big confrontation.  All she had to do was grab her ID and say here,  take a look.  NTA but I hope she learns to not let people get away with things", "Can relate. I worked in financial services, which at the time was predominately men. It took a long time for me to build credibility while my male colleagues were credible just by walking in the door.", "Why didn\u2019t you show them the ID anyway? You don\u2019t need permission. You acted 12 throughout this whole experience instead of standing up for yourself. Where was your spine? You\u2019re going to get this all the time in work and life, you can\u2019t mumble and sulk like a toddler every time. It just backs up their conception that you\u2019re too young. Stand up and act like the adult you claim to be. And this person is absolutely wrong. Your mother is not a gem, she should\u2019ve also been backing you up and having a word with the people talking down to you. But seriously, add some steel to your spine because you\u2019re being the asshole to yourself everyday if this is how you always react. You shouldn\u2019t have even handed back the drink."]}
