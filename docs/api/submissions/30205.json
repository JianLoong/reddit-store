You had a prior engagement that he failed to accommodate. Did he really \\*forget\\*, or did he decide to provoke a confrontation as a test of your commitment to him?", "NTA.

So he can be an adult, and own his mess up. Or he can find the door. Maybe at 31, he hasn't become an adult yet. That's an issue he has to work on.", "Are you sure he \u201cforgot\u201d you had plans with your stepdaughter?  I mean, you say he has a problem with you still being in her life, now this situation has conveniently set up a circumstance in which you would have to make a choice between the two.", "NTA. You're a maternal figure to that little girl. I don't know her relationship with her mom, but it's obvious she loves you. The same way you fulfill your promises to an adult, you must do it with a kid, and even more. Kids are very sensitive and also don't completely understand what a change of plans means. They can see it as a failing on them, or who knows what else. \n\nYour bf must understand that she was in your life much before him, and you bonded with her in a mother - daughter way. He made that reservation to make you choose. An excuse to get away with his in some way you don't know? Maybe he wants to do something, and is going to use your \"indifference\" towards him", "NTA.  I don't know you or your situation, but as soon as I read this, the first thing I thought was that he did it on purpose.

There may be times where you will choose to change plans with her for him and that is fine, as long as that is up to you and he is willing to accept when you do and don't do it.  Definitely **NTA** for making the girl a priority in your life.  In fact, very respectable.", "NTA, but you choice of men appears to be sub-par. You've become a mother figure and love your stepdaughter. Your current bf seems jealous of your stepdaughter.\n\nI don't know whether he intentionally scheduled your meal for the day you were spending with stepdaughter, but either way, he has no grounds to be angry.\n\nIf he's sick of being second place to a child you love, then second place is way higher than he deserves. Set him free and cure his sickness.", "NTA - he forgot and is trying to make you choose him. That's BS. His mistake, he isnt coming in second... unless this is a pattern and it's the last straw.\n\nNot that you did in this case, but have their been times when you had plans with him and backed out for her?

You told your bf about these plans but he still scheduled something without asking you first on the same day. I disagree with the people saying drop her, move on.

Sounds like he set it up on that day on purpose knowing that you would have to choose.

However, at the end of the day she is not your responsibility anymore and she's not your stepdaughter. You can still do things together, but I think you are overestimating your true responsibility when you claim you're occasionally in her life for milestones and you sometimes get her. It doesn't sound like it's happening all that often.", "Eh, you're NTA for sticking to plans you already had, but hopefully you do have an appreciation for anyone that dates you that isn't insecure about you maintaining a relationship with your ex due to a child that's not even your own. Not saying it's impossible to find a guy like that, it's just an odd situation for some. Also, if it's more than this incident then there's a pattern to look into. It's definitely worth seeing if you've been giving it a good shot with the dude and if the dude is worth the continued effort.", "INFO: how often do you see her? Do you have a habit of canceling plans with him for her? \n\nFrom this post alone, it seems like you don't see her that often, so to me it sounds like your bf is an AH for being jealous over your relationship with an 8-year old. For that alone, I'm leaning towards N T A. But there is a possibility that your bf genuinely forgot and was really looking forward to this dinner, and reacted terribly to that. He would still be an AH over that, but IMO that's something that can be discussed and remedied.", "It's nice that you can spend time with an ex bfs kid but your bf should come first.", "NTA. Dump the jealous and controlling bf. Don't allow him to become a future problem.", "YTA Would you be OK with your bf hanging out with his ex's kid? Would you be OK with your bf putting his ex's kid ahead of you. I don't think you would enjoy that and you would most likely get frustrated and become jealous by it.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole, your boyfriend is just jealous. Try paying him more attention and find ways to prove to him that you love him as equally as her. Also remind him that as an adult he should own up to his mistakes and not have you pick up after him (in a polite way).", "YTA you literally have no commitment to this kid but choose to prioritize her over your relationship with someone you supposedly are committed to.

It sounds like he will not be compatible long-term.", "Soft YTA. You don\u2019t have a responsibility to her, that\u2019s the thing. You need to let her go and move on with your life. It\u2019s going to be very hard, but it\u2019s what everyone needs in this situation, the daughter included. Holding onto your relationship with your ex\u2019s child is going to damage any relationship you try to have in the future.

If the date was insignificant to him and he simply wanted your time? he would\u2019ve rescheduled for the next night. This is some weird ass powerplay. He was trying to see if he could get you to abandon your plans with her so he could make this a consistent event. \u201cBut honey, I already told my parents we were going over for dinner\u201d \u201cI bought these tickets weeks in advance, I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the date. Are you really going to let these go to waste? It\u2019s too short notice to sell them now\u201d. He probably hoped that after awhile you\u2019d forget about her. \n\nHe\u2019s fully intending to cut that girl out of your life entirely. As is? you\u2019re not present on a daily or even weekly basis. I\u2019d be surprised if you even saw her on a bi monthly basis, to at the absolute most a monthly basis. It\u2019s not like your occasional commitment to her actually intrudes on his life, he just doesn\u2019t want her in it at all. You were smart not to fall for it (even once). If you don\u2019t cut this at the heals, he\u2019s going to get bolder and bolder, become more manipulative, and become more and more controlling over the situation. Drawing and setting clear set boundaries is the only way to go. I think what you said was perfect, that he or any future man in your life is going to have to take it or leave it but it won\u2019t be changed.\n\nHe needs to understand that you love him, but you\u2019re under no circumstances willing to sacrifice her to save this or any other relationship. That if that means you break up tomorrow so be it, sad as you may be that\u2019ll be the end of it. Then and only then will he understand that it\u2019s not a matter of if he can convince you to abandoning her; but the only thing he\u2019ll be convincing you to abandon is the relationship. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s not your blood. You mothered this child the same as any adoptive parent would\u2019ve. There\u2019s a bond, a love there that comes above all. Look I\u2019m willing to bet his comes more from your ex than the girl; but that doesn\u2019t matter. Fact is your ex is married, and you\u2019re actively in a committed relationship. He knows full well this isn\u2019t about you wanting your ex back or vice versa. This is about pride and nothing more. He just wants to feel like he\u2019s won. \n\nEdit: Honestly think about the morality of a person.. that would happily leave a young girl to wonder what she did wrong, why she wasn\u2019t good enough, and why her mom just chose to stop loving her: so long as he feels like he\u2019s won.

I dated this girl who had extremely abusive and neglectful parents who didn't do a thing to raise their kids. For a good period of that relationship i was literally buying my ex and her little sister all of their groceries, and i was a teenager at the time but working full time (long story), but the little sister ended up attaching to me as the male figure in her life because her dad was an addict and not in the picture and her step dad was useless and a piece of shit. I took the responsibility seriously as i recognized that what i did here and how i was with her sister was likely going to form her idea of what a healthy relationship looked like and what behaviors a man did were acceptable. I was with her older sister for 3 years, and we bonded and got very close (in a completely platonic way, there was never anything inappropriate, she was 5 years younger than me and i of course would never entertain anything even remotely inappropriate) in a sort of quasi brother/father way. I taught her a lot and did a lot of the parenting responsibilities for her. After her sister and i broke up i continued to be in her life and even though the sister and i ended on bad terms (she cheated) we agreed that it was important i remain active in her little sisters life so she didn't feel abandoned.

And your boyfriend did not forget. This was very much an intentional challenge to your commitments and his warped sense of loyalty. Regardless of what or who those plans were with though you had plans, you had advised him ahead of time him demanding that you drop everything for him is problematic. It's fine that he asked if you could/would change your plans but his clear expectation that you would do so and the tempertantrum when you refused is an indication of his selfishness.

Never mind who you were spending time with, it doesn\u2019t matter. You had plans.

At 8 years old, that's a big chunk. She cares about the girl, and the bio dad clearly sees that and sees that his daughter cares for her, hence why he'd allow his ex to continue seeing her. \nOP also made it pretty clear that she doesn't even see the girl that often, just for things like birthdays and the occasional day out. The fact that the bf is jealous over this and can't be second to an 8 year old on occasional (which is only happening because he \"forgot\" and made the reservation on the wrong day,) is a huge red flag. \nOp is NTA", "Not really tho?\nIt'd be different if she chose to do something with the kid over a date with her boyfriend, *but* the engagement with the kid existed first. And I don't care if it's her kid, someone elses child, a friend or just a rando, keeping to a prior engagement isn't an asshole move.\nIt's unfortunate, and it sucks and I get why the bf is annoyed, but just because I can sympathize doesn't mean OP is ab AH", "An 8 year old she has spent 3 years living in the same house with, and caring for, not it's not weird", "And she isn\u2019t your stepdaughter.

You really think this guy wants the girl to go?", "This and the above comment are exactly what I was looking for. This screams resentment and shit test.

They met the person 1 time. \nThey might be confused but will with big chance forget. (Unless you keep doing it multiple times.

This time, the person just vanishes.\nIt can be really confusing and hurt. \n\"Did I do something wrong since we can't speak anymore?\" \n\"Didn't I mean anything?\" \nThey won't just forget this person who was like a parent to them.

I wouldn't dream of keeping in contact unless I spent so much time with them that kid expressed deep sadness at never having contact with me anymore.

Sounds like you don't see the girl all that incredibly much.  But it is also hard to say you're sick of coming in 2nd if you came in 2nd exactly once.\n\nI'm not going to pull the \"she isn't really your daughter\" card...I will say NTA here, but communication is key going forward.

And there\u2019s no reason to be in touch with your ex either. His wife has approved. Only have contact with her for arrangements.

How often happens? \n\nAnd saying: \u201cI told him I have a responsibility to her and that he or any other man in my life will have to deal with it\u201d is red flag issue.

I personally wouldn't deal with anything like that, and that's fine. Maybe he can't deal with it. You all just need to go ur separate ways. Imo, she is  not ur kid, and it sounds like she has a mom and dad, so to me, I feel u need to back tf off. But if mom and dad r ok with it. Then who cares it's ur life.

He doesn't pass the vibe check. I have tons of kiddos in my family, and if they ever felt funky around any potential significant other, then sorry, he'd be gone.", "It will only become problematic if the adults in the child's life lets it become problematic. You must not have children in your life to think someone should go \"cold turkey\" on being in someone's life.", "That may be the case, but then it's not the scheduling conflict that's a problem but rather a lack of communication in the whole relationship.\nAnd if it was a \"test\" than that's shitty behaviour in itself.\n\nIn this specific interaction OP isn't the asshole. And if this was a test then both OP and the BF are at fault for not properly communicating in their relationship. \nIf OP wants a relationship with the Ex-kid and BF feels underappreciated because of it, then they're not the right ppl for each other and should talk about it like adults instead of running \"tests\"", "I disagree. Can't tell if the kid was 8 at the time or is 8 now, but that's old enough to grasp the concept of parents / step-parent separating.

If things go wrong, you are at the mercy of the parent/ex partner that they went wrong with. That could instantly mean you are cut off from the child. Or, maybe they allow some type of visitation etc. Then the parent finds a new partner that isn't like the partner in OPs story and isn't fine with an ex seeing the child so boom, cut off. Or maybe you, as the ex, annoy the parent and boom, cut off. \n\nI think as an idea it is easy to think an ex should commit to being in a non bio kids life from an ex partner if they had a significant role in their life for a time. But on the flip side, that is a huge mental commitment and mind fuck for the non bio partner who could be cut out at anytime, if they are even allowed to see the kid going forward.", "I have my children in my life but not other peoples, that would be weird.", "There's a difference between someone you're dating and someone whose life you came into for only 3 years. Kid has a new mom, so it's weird that this woman is sticking around for a fake obligation she self imposed.", "The boyfriend is just a fickle nobody in comparison. She's known him less time.", "Not surprising coming from an incel who never dated."]}
