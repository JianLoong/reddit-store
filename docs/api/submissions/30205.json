Which brings us to his plan for this next weekend: he made some dinner reservations in a place we\u2019re trying to go to for quite some time, but he forgot - and I reminded him - that I made plans to get my stepdaughter this Saturday for the night. He got mad because I refused to change my plans, and said he\u2019s sick of being second place to a girl that isn\u2019t even my daughter.

Your stepdaughter and you already had plans. It's way more hurtful for a child to be stood up by a parental figure of sorts than it is for two adults to reschedule dinner at a fancy place.", "NTA. You had a prior engagement that he failed to accommodate. Did he really \\*forget\\*, or did he decide to provoke a confrontation as a test of your commitment to him?", "NTA. I\u2019d probably have said n-a-h if he didn\u2019t get angry about you refusing to try and change your plans\u2026I mean you say he \u201cforgot\u201d you were busy Saturday so obviously you told him you were doing something with sd that day. If he can\u2019t deal with this, I don\u2019t see much hope for this relationship\u2019s longevity", "NTA and let's review this part: \n\n>but he forgot\n\nThat's on him, and only him. So he can be an adult, and own his mess up. Or he can find the door. Maybe at 31, he hasn't become an adult yet. That's an issue he has to work on.", "Are you sure he \u201cforgot\u201d you had plans with your stepdaughter?  I mean, you say he has a problem with you still being in her life, now this situation has conveniently set up a circumstance in which you would have to make a choice between the two.", "NTA. You're a maternal figure to that little girl. I don't know her relationship with her mom, but it's obvious she loves you. The same way you fulfill your promises to an adult, you must do it with a kid, and even more. Kids are very sensitive and also don't completely understand what a change of plans means. They can see it as a failing on them, or who knows what else. \n\nYour bf must understand that she was in your life much before him, and you bonded with her in a mother - daughter way. He made that reservation to make you choose. An excuse to get away with his in some way you don't know? Maybe he wants to do something, and is going to use your \"indifference\" towards him", "NTA.  I don't know you or your situation, but as soon as I read this, the first thing I thought was that he did it on purpose.  I think he tried to do a \"which one will she pick\".", "There should be some level of compromise on your end when it comes to all things involving your new guy.  However, given what you have said here it certainly seems like he is having trouble accepting, or at least understanding, your relationship with this girl.  He certainly does not get to dictate when you do or don't get to have contact, visits, or spend time with her.  It seems like he feels he is competing with her for your time and doesn't like it.  There may be times where you will choose to change plans with her for him and that is fine, as long as that is up to you and he is willing to accept when you do and don't do it.  Definitely **NTA** for making the girl a priority in your life.  In fact, very respectable.", "NTA, but you choice of men appears to be sub-par. You've become a mother figure and love your stepdaughter. Your current bf seems jealous of your stepdaughter.\n\nI don't know whether he intentionally scheduled your meal for the day you were spending with stepdaughter, but either way, he has no grounds to be angry.\n\nIf he's sick of being second place to a child you love, then second place is way higher than he deserves. Set him free and cure his sickness.", "NTA - he forgot and is trying to make you choose him. That's BS. His mistake, he isnt coming in second... unless this is a pattern and it's the last straw.\n\nNot that you did in this case, but have their been times when you had plans with him and backed out for her? If so, then YTA for that and it's probably what he is mad about.", "He didn't 'forget', he purposely made the plans as a way to manipulate you into leaving your ex's daughter behind.\n\nYou need a new bf.\n\nNTA", "NTA You made plans that I\u2019m sure both you and she are looking forward to. You told your bf about these plans but he still scheduled something without asking you first on the same day. I disagree with the people saying drop her, move on. You had and have a relationship with her. Your ex is okay with it, his wife is okay with it but your new bf seems to be both insecure and jealous. It\u2019s a red flag. Keep your plans and tell him if he\u2019s not okay with the situation you might not be right for each other.", "Sounds like you and the new wife are very rare loving people who have this girls best interests in your heads and hearts.  \n\nSounds like the boyfriend never had any parental issues?  Does he have younger family kids that  he is close to so you could try to explain the disappointment and hurt a broken promise would mean?", "NTA. Sounds like he set it up on that day on purpose knowing that you would have to choose. There is no way he accidentally forgot when he already doesn\u2019t like that you hang out with your former step daughter. What he is doing is really gross and manipulative \ud83d\udea9 I hope you find someone better. Best of luck.", "NTA you go make that girl happy and you'll never regret cause it's worth it", "INFO\n\nHow often are you actually seeing her? Cause you saying this doesn't make it seem like a lot. \n\n>My ex is now remarried and his new wife is fine with my occasional presence in milestones of her life, such as birthdays; I also get her sometimes for a day out.", "So I think it's great you're still in your ex-stepdaughter's life. However, at the end of the day she is not your responsibility anymore and she's not your stepdaughter. You can still do things together, but I think you are overestimating your true responsibility when you claim you're occasionally in her life for milestones and you sometimes get her. It doesn't sound like it's happening all that often.", "Eh, you're NTA for sticking to plans you already had, but hopefully you do have an appreciation for anyone that dates you that isn't insecure about you maintaining a relationship with your ex due to a child that's not even your own. Not saying it's impossible to find a guy like that, it's just an odd situation for some. Also, if it's more than this incident then there's a pattern to look into. It's definitely worth seeing if you've been giving it a good shot with the dude and if the dude is worth the continued effort.", "INFO: how often do you see her? Do you have a habit of canceling plans with him for her? \n\nFrom this post alone, it seems like you don't see her that often, so to me it sounds like your bf is an AH for being jealous over your relationship with an 8-year old. For that alone, I'm leaning towards N T A. But there is a possibility that your bf genuinely forgot and was really looking forward to this dinner, and reacted terribly to that. He would still be an AH over that, but IMO that's something that can be discussed and remedied.", "It's nice that you can spend time with an ex bfs kid but your bf should come first.", "NTA. Dump the jealous and controlling bf. Don't allow him to become a future problem.", "YTA Would you be OK with your bf hanging out with his ex's kid? Would you be OK with your bf putting his ex's kid ahead of you. I don't think you would enjoy that and you would most likely get frustrated and become jealous by it.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole, your boyfriend is just jealous. Try paying him more attention and find ways to prove to him that you love him as equally as her. Also remind him that as an adult he should own up to his mistakes and not have you pick up after him (in a polite way).", "YTA you literally have no commitment to this kid but choose to prioritize her over your relationship with someone you supposedly are committed to. You have **zero** responsibility to her, so I don't know where you get this idea from.", "Why couldn\u2019t she have join you guys for dinner? It sounds like he will not be compatible long-term.", "Soft YTA. You don\u2019t have a responsibility to her, that\u2019s the thing. You need to let her go and move on with your life. It\u2019s going to be very hard, but it\u2019s what everyone needs in this situation, the daughter included. Holding onto your relationship with your ex\u2019s child is going to damage any relationship you try to have in the future. Saturday and Friday nights are for couples, not for your ex\u2019s daughter. Tbh, if you were a guy people would saying how inappropriate this is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m glad to see that you stuck with the commitment about becoming a true mother to a stepchild.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.", "Nta. He didn\u2019t forget. He knew what he was doing.", "NTA \n\nThis has jack shit to do with you choosing her over his date. You know why? Because he specifically planned his dinner on the day he knew you\u2019d have her. If the date was insignificant to him and he simply wanted your time? he would\u2019ve rescheduled for the next night. This is some weird ass powerplay. He was trying to see if he could get you to abandon your plans with her so he could make this a consistent event. \u201cBut honey, I already told my parents we were going over for dinner\u201d \u201cI bought these tickets weeks in advance, I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the date. Are you really going to let these go to waste? It\u2019s too short notice to sell them now\u201d. He probably hoped that after awhile you\u2019d forget about her. \n\nHe\u2019s fully intending to cut that girl out of your life entirely. As is? you\u2019re not present on a daily or even weekly basis. I\u2019d be surprised if you even saw her on a bi monthly basis, to at the absolute most a monthly basis. It\u2019s not like your occasional commitment to her actually intrudes on his life, he just doesn\u2019t want her in it at all. You were smart not to fall for it (even once). If you don\u2019t cut this at the heals, he\u2019s going to get bolder and bolder, become more manipulative, and become more and more controlling over the situation. Drawing and setting clear set boundaries is the only way to go. I think what you said was perfect, that he or any future man in your life is going to have to take it or leave it but it won\u2019t be changed.\n\nHe needs to understand that you love him, but you\u2019re under no circumstances willing to sacrifice her to save this or any other relationship. That if that means you break up tomorrow so be it, sad as you may be that\u2019ll be the end of it. Then and only then will he understand that it\u2019s not a matter of if he can convince you to abandoning her; but the only thing he\u2019ll be convincing you to abandon is the relationship. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s not your blood. You mothered this child the same as any adoptive parent would\u2019ve. There\u2019s a bond, a love there that comes above all. Look I\u2019m willing to bet his comes more from your ex than the girl; but that doesn\u2019t matter. Fact is your ex is married, and you\u2019re actively in a committed relationship. He knows full well this isn\u2019t about you wanting your ex back or vice versa. This is about pride and nothing more. He just wants to feel like he\u2019s won. \n\nEdit: Honestly think about the morality of a person.. that would happily leave a young girl to wonder what she did wrong, why she wasn\u2019t good enough, and why her mom just chose to stop loving her: so long as he feels like he\u2019s won.  He needs to grow the fuck up and grow a heart while he\u2019s at it, but I suspect it\u2019s too late to make him grow one in time to save this relationship.", "Nta and please rethink this relationship", "> he forgot\n\nHis problem.
