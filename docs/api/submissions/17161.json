It is humor that sometimes offends, but that\u2019s because it points to a cognitive dissonance in life - most people have an inherent sense of fairness, but they have lived in a sea of ableism all their life, so they accept ableist ideas and ways of doing things without thinking about them.  This humor pokes people right in the cognitive dissonance, which is probably on the whole a good thing, as it challenges their acceptance of a casually ableist world.  But some folks respond to awareness of their cognitive dissonance with offense or anger (\u201cI would never be unfair to people, I don\u2019t hate disabled people!
