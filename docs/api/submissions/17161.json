You know who gets to choose whether they joke about disabled life and their specific disability?  The disabled person.\n\nIf your son loves this sort of thing, and he chooses to wear these shirts, more power to him.  Humor is often an important part of coping with an ableist world (says this disabled adult).  Given his age, you\u2019re at the point where you may need to have a \u201cthere is a time and place for humor, and not all times and places work for this kind of humor.\u201d  It\u2019s a tricky thing to judge, especially for neurodiverse people, so he may want to check in (or have you check in) about these shirts for places he doesn\u2019t regularly go.  It is humor that sometimes offends, but that\u2019s because it points to a cognitive dissonance in life - most people have an inherent sense of fairness, but they have lived in a sea of ableism all their life, so they accept ableist ideas and ways of doing things without thinking about them.  This humor pokes people right in the cognitive dissonance, which is probably on the whole a good thing, as it challenges their acceptance of a casually ableist world.  But some folks respond to awareness of their cognitive dissonance with offense or anger (\u201cI would never be unfair to people, I don\u2019t hate disabled people!  What I do isn\u2019t ableist!\u201d), because it allows them to avoid dealing with the real problem.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't understand the jokes and was thus not part of the joke, it would be a different situation.

Humor is a coping mechanism and if that's what works for him more power to him. \nMy mother and grandfather were both in wheelchairs for life and would have loved shirts like that.", "NTA, if your immediate family says they\u2019re just his style then idk why you\u2019d listen to anyone else.", "Anyone who gets offended over a ten year old's tshirt isn't someone I'd want to be around.
