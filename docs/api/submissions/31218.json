From the moment I turned 18 and started working I made it clear that phase of our relationship (her telling me what I can and can\u2019t do) was over. She is now fully aware that I will tell her to fuck off if she annoys me (I haven\u2019t done it, but she knows I would). You are an adult, you are allowed to have boundary\u2019s with your parents.

He\u2019d never had a gf before me, he was 30 when I met him. His life was just work and video games. This has caused so many issues and still does, he\u2019s obsessed with video games (I game too but he\u2019ll choose video games over anything and everything if I don\u2019t speak up) he\u2019s super defensive and even the slightest disagreement or me asking for any help around the house (he says he\u2019d always fight with his mom cuz he couldn\u2019t do anything ever and in her eyes was always criticized or wrong, so all mole hills become mountains if he\u2019s even slightly asked to change a behaviour).

Go to college or move in with roommates, but the situation you\u2019re in isn\u2019t healthy and maybe if it\u2019s open for you seek therapy to make sure you don\u2019t end up riddled with guilt for improving your life.

It would seem that the three of you should sit down and discuss the rules of the house from an adult-to-adult point of view instead of an adult-to-child point of view.  Just remember that it's their house & while you said you help clean and such, I didn't read where you help with utilities or pay rent. Take a look around where you live and work, what is the cost for a place to live, utilities, insurance, food, etc. Would you be able to survive moving out? Then sit down and talk to your parents. Listen to them explain why they imposed such rules. Is it due to religious or cultural beliefs? Try to negotiate changes to the rules due to your age. Start off small, and then after 3-6 months, sit back down and renegotiate for something a little more. Doing it in small increments might be easier than doing it all at once.  Is there a way that you can show them you're responsible and considerate with their requirements or feelings? \"Will you allow me to prove to you that I can go out and meet with my friends and not cause any damage to myself or the family?\"", "NTA but what the 4377 is the matter with your control freak parents?

You are not wrong - they are just awful.", "Next time they throw \"your sister doesn't go out\" at you, ask them in all seriousness and calmness, is she happy not being able to live her life?\n\nNTA at all. You live your life. Try not to go overboard with any new found freedom. Being out every night just because you can is not healthy. There is nothing wrong with a few nights a week - it'll be about balance.\n\nYou'll probably be much happier if you can move out. They're saying these nasty things to manipulate you into their way of thinking and control. I'd ask what they're scared of. I'm also curious about how they met? A bar, church, birthday celebration, college, do you and your siblings not deserve that too?", "NTA at all and you are rightfully taking some control of your life.  Only thing I would add here is just remember your parents are doing this out of deep, though misguided, love for you.  They are not trying to be horrible to you, it's just how they are manifesting that love that is the problem.
