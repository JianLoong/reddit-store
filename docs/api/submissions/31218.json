Your parents should acknowledge that you are an adult and have the right to make your own decisions. It's important to live your life and pursue happiness, especially considering your health conditions. Don't feel guilty for standing up for yourself and seeking fulfillment.", "NTA. You're a grown up and perfectly capable of making your own decisions! Definitely not saying you're mooching of your parents, but perhaps it is time to think about moving out? Imagine the freedom!", "NTA.  You mom had it coming. You were nicer than I would have been. Set a boundry that they are not permitted to interfer in your social life.", "NTA. Same exact situation over here but I\u2019m 27  now I moved out at 24. GET AN RV!! Mobile living cheap spots to park and you don\u2019t have to know where you want to permanently live. You gotta get outta there before it gets physical with your pops", "Absolutely NTA! Your parents are super controlling, and I totally get feeling mixed up about it, it's always hard to start standing up for yourself under that kind of pressure. But omg, I'm so proud of you for doing it! You deserve to hang out with friends if you want to. \n\nIt sounds like you're already giving your family so much of yourself, and they're angry that you're not giving them all of you. But you need things for you, you deserve to take care of yourself and enjoy life. Anyone who calls you \"a garbage human being\" is wrong and doesn't have your wellbeing in mind. That they're angry you're not letting them control every bit of your life is on them, and it's their selfishness that's the problem. \n\nYou are a good person, you have value and worth as yourself, as a human who has thoughts and feelings and desires and needs, and you get to have things for yourself because they matter to you. You deserve love and care and respect because you're you and you matter.

When I was a kid if she ever told me to do something it was always because she said so, no effort to explain why. That is genuinely my only complaint about her, she was otherwise an amazing and loving mother. From the moment I turned 18 and started working I made it clear that phase of our relationship (her telling me what I can and can\u2019t do) was over. She is now fully aware that I will tell her to fuck off if she annoys me (I haven\u2019t done it, but she knows I would). You are an adult, you are allowed to have boundary\u2019s with your parents. You did nothing wrong. Just let them know where you go so they know you are safe. Good luck OP.", "Isolation is a form of abuse.", "My partner grew up similar to this, overly sheltered, didn\u2019t see a movie until his 20s, has never been to a concert or been trick or treating. He\u2019d never had a gf before me, he was 30 when I met him. His life was just work and video games. This has caused so many issues and still does, he\u2019s obsessed with video games (I game too but he\u2019ll choose video games over anything and everything if I don\u2019t speak up) he\u2019s super defensive and even the slightest disagreement or me asking for any help around the house (he says he\u2019d always fight with his mom cuz he couldn\u2019t do anything ever and in her eyes was always criticized or wrong, so all mole hills become mountains if he\u2019s even slightly asked to change a behaviour). I could go on forever about all of this, but why I\u2019m typing it out is to say please consider moving and please do not stop trying to socialize, it will mess you up if it\u2019s not by your own choice. You\u2019re not wrong or guilty for wanting to be free and do normal things. Go to college or move in with roommates, but the situation you\u2019re in isn\u2019t healthy and maybe if it\u2019s open for you seek therapy to make sure you don\u2019t end up riddled with guilt for improving your life.  Also a huge NTA", "NTA. Move out as soon as possible.", "You're an adult, living with your parents. It would seem that the three of you should sit down and discuss the rules of the house from an adult-to-adult point of view instead of an adult-to-child point of view.  Just remember that it's their house & while you said you help clean and such, I didn't read where you help with utilities or pay rent. Take a look around where you live and work, what is the cost for a place to live, utilities, insurance, food, etc. Would you be able to survive moving out? Then sit down and talk to your parents. Listen to them explain why they imposed such rules. Is it due to religious or cultural beliefs? Try to negotiate changes to the rules due to your age. Start off small, and then after 3-6 months, sit back down and renegotiate for something a little more. Doing it in small increments might be easier than doing it all at once.  Is there a way that you can show them you're responsible and considerate with their requirements or feelings? \"Will you allow me to prove to you that I can go out and meet with my friends and not cause any damage to myself or the family?\"", "NTA but what the 4377 is the matter with your control freak parents?  You pay your own way, and they shame you for having fun, and believe you should only go out once a week, at the most?\n\nYou are an adult, and they are abusive.\n\nMove out.  Find roommates, even go to a shelter if you have to.  Good lord.  You are not wrong - they are just awful.", "Next time they throw \"your sister doesn't go out\" at you, ask them in all seriousness and calmness, is she happy not being able to live her life?\n\nNTA at all. You live your life. Try not to go overboard with any new found freedom. Being out every night just because you can is not healthy. There is nothing wrong with a few nights a week - it'll be about balance.\n\nYou'll probably be much happier if you can move out. They're saying these nasty things to manipulate you into their way of thinking and control. I'd ask what they're scared of. I'm also curious about how they met? A bar, church, birthday celebration, college, do you and your siblings not deserve that too?", "NTA at all and you are rightfully taking some control of your life.  Only thing I would add here is just remember your parents are doing this out of deep, though misguided, love for you.  They are not trying to be horrible to you, it's just how they are manifesting that love that is the problem.  And they are human beings and will learn and grow from this experience, which is really good for them quite frankly.  So please continue to do the right thing for yourself, be considerate of them in the process, and you can all end up better for it.", "It\u2019s quite simple really. You\u2019re 23, you are an adult. So you have a decision to make. Do you want the comfort of living at home and having to stick by the rules your parents set for you, or do you want the freedom to go out whenever you want and thus move out of their home? If you can\u2019t afford to move out, so be it, but you\u2019re gonna have to play by their rules. So yeah, right now, YTA. You can\u2019t have total freedom in your parent\u2019s home.", "If you don\u2019t like their rules, move out.", "I want to say N T A but I need more info. What culture do you come from? Is this style of parenting the norm?\n\nI grew up almost identically to you, except I LOVED IT!\n\nTo this day I prefer to stay home rather than go out; I can be so productive at home; why waste time driving unless absolutely necessary?\n\nEdit: after careful reflection, I'm changing my vote to YTA. OP clearly doesn't know how good she has it with such caring and wonderful parents. She's being selfish and unthoughtful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
