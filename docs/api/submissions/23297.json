In the beginning of the relationship he put effort in coming to family things even though they were a 2 hour drive or hanging out with my friends. Now we are married and his job has been really stressful, plus he\u2019s found out he doesn\u2019t like my family or friends. All of this leads to me going to a lot of gatherings alone and getting berated with \u201cwhere\u2019s your husband?\u201d, \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t he come?\u201d, etc. \n\nI normally have made up excuses for him in the past but lately I\u2019m tired of that so am just telling them the truth. He doesn\u2019t like them and doesn\u2019t want to be there. They now all think he\u2019s a jerk and feel bad for me that I\u2019m constantly going to things alone. Now he\u2019s upset at me even though that\u2019s the truth and they don\u2019t understand any other reason why he can\u2019t come.

Am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR; I told my family and friends my husband doesn\u2019t like them instead of lying about why he doesn\u2019t come with me to gatherings.\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone who let me know that I was indeed the asshole! I really wanted to be a bit extreme with my post to get the brute of my actions and could have added that I really only told 2 friends and basically just my sister and a couple of family members. So the damage isn\u2019t too bad as some are worried. Many people have given me great advice on how I can fix my wording and still be telling the truth and many have seen my side. Thank you to everyone! \n\nWe have actually come to a new understanding of the situation. He doesn\u2019t feel like he hates my family and friends as he use to convey through some reflecting. He feels like since I\u2019m so extroverted I kinda leave him too much at the gatherings and then he\u2019s alone and not having fun. So in the future I\u2019m going to try to not just ditch him to talk to others and make sure I\u2019m doing my best to make it more enjoyable for him and not just expect him to socialize and hold his own. This honestly could be where I\u2019ve been an asshole too. We are realizing a lot about how our differences as extrovert vs. introvert has led to some misconceptions and misunderstandings.

Reading your update as an introvert myself, the situation you described of you leaving him alone to socialize with people he doesn\u2019t know very well sounds like a literal nightmare to me. I would have been absolutely dreading these events in his shoes. Outing him the way you did maybe not the best way to go about it.\n\nHe is also at fault here though. He clearly did not adequately communicate to you what it felt like from his perspective attending these events. There are definitely ways an extrovert taking an introvert to meet new people can mitigate how rough it is. If you stay with him and make an active effort to steer conversations into topics he can also participate in, it can make it go from a terrorizing prospect to even a bit fun, especially as he gets to know them better and gets more comfortable. It seems that if he had communicated his feelings better to you that this whole situation could have been avoided since you do seem open to trying to understand the introvert perspective and trying to make it better for him.", "YTA.

He keeps claiming his job is stressful right now because of a temporary assignment where\u2019s he\u2019s driving 1 extra hour 3 times a week but otherwise the last 2 years he\u2019s had a stay at home job and hangs out with his family weekly.

I have apologized", "Yes, they\u2019ve very normal and chill people. No crazy family members.

Maybe it would have been better to say he\u2019s uncomfortable around people he doesn\u2019t know well. But it sounds like he wants to put zero effort. As your spouse he should be going with you to some events. I\u2019m a bit surprised you\u2019re married if it\u2019s important to have a spouse who is involved with your family and friends too.

For every Christmas from now on?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem realistic. It seems more like you purposefully made it pretty much impossible for your husband to accompany you to any family event ever again. At least not without a huge level of awkwardness. \n\nYou could have told your family what you explained at the beginning of your post here: that your husband is an introvert and large gatherings make him extremely uncomfortable. \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t really understand introversion, which is odd since you married an introvert. I\u2019m an extrovert myself, but I have a few very good friends who are introverts. \n\nI understand they have limits on both time and people. Too much time socializing or too many people and they\u2019re overstimulated and need to leave. They *have* to have time alone. I may not fully understand this need, but I do understand that not everyone works the same way. This is simply who they are and how they experience the world. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m honored that they\u2019re willing to spend any of their social battery on me. \n\nSo anyway, I\u2019m going to have to go with YTA here. You could and should have handled this differently. I don\u2019t think you can really undo what you did, but maybe that was the point?", "Well that's their issue to have. Your husband did nothing wrong and you screwed him over with your friends and family. Why would he want to see them more now knowing they dislike him? You've ruined it for yourself.\n\nStay at home jobs can be stressful too fyi", "This is where I'm going to differ from what others are saying here. Your husband hangs out with HIS friends and family constantly - that doesn't scream introvert to me. Rather, I see someone who is firmly entrenched in his comfort zone and too selfish to blend your lives the way normal married couples do.\n\nYou told the truth - he doesn't like your friends and family, and doesn't want to make the effort to blend your social lives. He's refusing to become a part of your family and social life, even though you've done it for him.", "NAH\n\nIf he is an introvert - all of that sounds like a nightmare to me as another introvert.\n\nYour family/friends could be nicest, sweetest people on the planet and I would still want to run the other way. It's nothing against your family, but crowds/groups are overwhelming and draining. I am fine with groups/crowds in a work setting, but a social one is a whole other story. \n\nHowever, I don't think that means that he should make you go to events alone all the time. I don't necessarily enjoy them, but my husband does. I want to support & make him happy too. His needs/wants are also important, just like yours are. You are allowed to get frustrated and to not feel the need to lie to those people.\n\nDoes he not like them or can he does he just not like the crowds? Or could it be that he doesn't know how to articulate that?", "Given that information, you're NTA. \n\nI feel like part of being in a relationship is supporting each other's social circles. If you were off the hook for his stuff too that would be one thing. But that doesn't seem like a fair arrangement. \n\nThis is coming from an introverted male too so believe me I know what it's like to show up to social gatherings where you either don't like or are not comfortable with most of the people there. \n\nI'm not saying the dude has to go to all of your family and friend events but at least go to the ones that are a higher priority once in a while.", "Glad you did!", "How is \u201che\u2019s an introvert and needed alone time today\u201d not a valid excuse?", "Yes I agree and thankfully it was only to like 2 friends and so not too many wells poisoned. Still frustrated they I\u2019ll have to continue making up excuses and lies and them not liking him anyway because he\u2019s not there.", "You\u2019re so right about the wording!!!

And to make me drive hours alone, away from him at all of these things and wishing he was there. I\u2019ve asked him to try to compromise and it\u2019s still been no effort on his part to come. Then he\u2019s out with his family every week and he\u2019s hanging with his friends multiple times a week. I guess I should\u2019ve wrote that in the post but I don\u2019t like one of his family members but I still go to everything. I\u2019ve become a bit more introverted and have days where I don\u2019t want to go but he\u2019s never once gone to something alone if I had no other conflict.", "He did nothing wrong? Maybe this is just me, but I\u2019m uncomfortable constantly LYING to my family, especially for my husband. I definitely think OP could\u2019ve handled it better but after years of this, it\u2019s frustrating!", "Yeah, I am surprised by all the YTAs. The issue is not that he is an introvert, it\u2019s that he is not willing to make the effort. In the world, millions of sons and daughters-in-law dislike their in-laws, but they still make the effort to visit them a couple times a month with their wives. There is no reciprocation here.", "Thank you for helping me feel a little validated. I definitely didn\u2019t help the situation but he hasn\u2019t tried to help either or make it easier on me.", "He doesn\u2019t mind crowds but through this post we have actually come to a new understanding of the situation.

And apologies in advance for unsolicited advice, but you could tell people he's a complete introvert and has social anxiety, and doesn't feel comfortable outside his shell.

As long as he treats you well, that's the most important part.", "Ok", "He has put in the effort to build a relationship, hence discovering he doesn't like them. \n\nObviously he's seeing his family and family when work is stressful. It's a totally different atmosphere than hanging with in laws he doesn't like. I don't blame him. \n\nDon't take an issue you have with your husband and air it like that. He's not going to see them ever again now you've done this, you've brought it on yourself", "Why should you have to lie for him?

He married you, your family is his family now, but instead he's refusing to participate in a very big part of married life.", "That's good to read. Once you both have a better understanding of the other, these types of events get a whole lot easier for both of you.

Glad that you and your husband talked things through!", "I've been married for 22 years. My husband is an introvert and I'm an extrovert. Early on, I had to learn how to help integrate him into conversations and not leave him to attempt small talk at a party.

People make it way too extreme and act like you hate people and can't be around them if you're an introvert.", "Because said high effort person not only threw him under the bus, but left him alone during prior social gatherings. (See edits)\n\nMy ex did exaclty the latter to me once. I we arrived to a New Year's Eve Party - it was the ex's circle, I knew nobody -, and some friend greets her and tells me they need to catch up, and they hope it's okay with me, and I'm like sure but...(and they are already gone) ...wouln't it be a good idea to introduce me first to the others?\n\nIt somehow worked out, but I have no clue how, and it was like the worst one hour of my life. If hell exists it must be exaclty like that.\n\nBut yeah sure, blame the introvert he's clearly defective.\n\nBefore I forget: YTA.", "That\u2019s what I was wondering, how frequent are these four hour round trips? I suspect he\u2019s over that, too. Like, does OP not have any friends closer to home?", "I agree that there would have been better ways to handle this, because just telling them the full truth about it doesn\u2018t help either and as you correctly stated, makes it harder to build a relationship. but she\u2018s not the one to blame here, as she\u2018s not responsible to build the relationships that he doesn\u2018t want to build. I know you didn\u2018t mean it that way, but I\u2018m just tired of the expectations that women always have to do all \u201esocial work\u201c in relationships and always have to make sure that they stay in touch with other people, even if they have to lie to their friends and family.", "I suspect that at least part of it is the distance to be driven to see your family, combined with what sounds like a relatively high frequency.", "I feel like the N T A votes are just glossing over the four hour round trip Drive to go see her friends and family. It\u2019s not like all else is equal. His friends and family live nearby, hers live a two hour drive away.", "I\u2019ll be honest with you though, it sounds like OP is making this four hour round trip pretty often, and there is nothing that would induce me to do that frequently, especially if it\u2019s for something that I don\u2019t enjoy.", "Having social anxiety isn't a \"trait of introverts.\" Those are two fully unrelated things. Introversion and extroversion are measures of how you get energy; they don't have anything to do with anxiety or hating people/socialization. Plenty of extroverts have social anxiety and plenty of introverts don't. The internet just conflates all this stuff in the same way the internet oversimplifies and warps just about everything.", "If you really want to get into it, there are several different types of introverts, and using \"introvert\" as a blanket term is...conflating all this stuff. \n\nlol"]}
