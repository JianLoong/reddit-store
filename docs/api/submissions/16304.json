The custody agreement needs to be amended to consider his new living situation and the dogs ages, he can't just play dog dad once a year and expect the dogs to not suffer the huge disruption to their lives. Its heartbreaking to me that people still don't comprehend that dogs are affected by this kind of stuff.", "NTA\nWhat a ludicrous situation.\nHe wants the dogs more, he does the driving.", "NTA.\n\nIf he wants them more- it's on his dime and time. You can set your phone to not answer his calls and all texts go into mute. You are not at his beck and call, but you still act like you are. I am guessing this a leftover residue of the marriage dynamics.\n\nIf a 1,000 Redditors can't help you see the idiocy of this, maybe a really good trauma therapist could.", "I agree. And as I'm not doing what he wants, he's getting more and more acrimonious.", "Yes, you're right. During the divorce process, he was effectively stalking me, secret recordings, having 'friends' stalking my social media, etc, and trying to use this as evidence. Of what, I have no idea, but he had to be told by his lawyer that this is completely inappropriate and that he needs to stop.", "Yeah, he's just told me that unless I agree to talk to him, he's keeping them until I do. Which violates our order. He's not being fair to them.", "nta", "NTA;\n\nIn fairness, situations do change. That is natural in life and clearly he is bothered about the dogs as this agreement has continued and now his circumstances has changed he wants to spend more time.\n\nThat being said, if it is not financially or physically faesible for you, he is TA for harrassing you on the same point as opposed to working together to find an alternative compromise that works for both of you.\n\nHappy the doggos are loved \u2665\ufe0f", "I mean, unless the dogs are actually human children and the OP is just curious how reddit would react in this situation if they were pets, he has absolutely no fucking legal rights and OP could block his number and never speak to him again and he couldn't do a damn thing about it. I assume the decision in the courts was mediating therms that they were both happy with in order to complete the divorce. The divorce is now completed. Dogs are, legally speaking, property, and not very highly valued property at that - it's not the equivalent of, say, OP reneging on the sale and division of profits from a house. Absolutely no court will demand that OP meet his demands and I struggle to see any of them doing much more than *maybe* granting him a small amount of monetary compensation for OP deciding to quit the whole agreement, and that's only if he's been contributing to their care financially enough to be considered a partial owner."]}
