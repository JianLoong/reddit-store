I would encourage you to go back to court to get sole custody of the dogs in light of his concerning behavior and the dogs' advanced age.\n\nIf he hasn't had regular contact with them for a decade, it must be disruptive and confusing for the dogs to go through this. All of the stress and back and forth can't be good for them. If he really cares about them he should let you keep them and get his own dogs.", "NTA- I think you need to get some legal paperwork done for this. If he has not been in the dogs lives much in the last few years then he needs to just accept its better for THEM if he stops trying to disrupt their routines.", "NTA. While I fully understand the emotional attachment to particular animals, this insistence seems a) unreasonable and b) not consistent with the previous agreement.

File paperwork\n\nHis behavior is inconsistent with what he has done in the past several years. Now  all of a sudden you have to accommodate a hardship so he can be with the dogs.

However, unlikely to happen.", "My thoughts exactly.", "They're getting old. One is 10 this year and the other is 8. Which is another reason I don't think it's fair. They're pretty chilled, but it's not fair to be driving all that way on the reg.", "This. There never should have been a 'custody agreement' in the first place. They could have each chosen one dog and gone their separate ways years ago. Sorry, but there's no way I'd still even be entertaining any type of calls from my ex after years of being separated. \n\nIf you must go back to court to terminate his 'rights', do it and then block his number permanently. \n\nThere are so many other things you could be doing with your time and energy instead of being hassled by an ex.", "They're going to be 10 and 8 this year. \nI live in a house with a garden, he's in a flat with a balcony.

If you've been providing 90% of food and vet care for 10 years, the law says they're your property.

Might have to give it a go!", "yes, but about 10 years ago people used to do a lot of these custody agreements for pets in divorces. judges seem to have increasingly gone- you can do whatever you outside of court but to the court, this ain't a thing.\n\njudge: you want joint legal custody of your cocker spaniel? yeah, no."]}
