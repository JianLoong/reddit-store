According to him he needs: total darkness, no TV, a podcast as a background noise and 30 minutes of reading. \n\nHere is where it gets complicated, I have severe anxiety and mostly all the time I am struggling with intrusive thoughts, for this I use the TV a background noise to fall sleep and to drown my intrusive thoughts. But I am more than willing to compromise; once\u2019s he it\u2019s in bed I shut down the TV even if I am not sleep. However his system haven\u2019t been working, and he ends up waking me up around 03:39 am ( I check the time because I feel I miss my alarm) and once\u2019s I am awake I cannot fall sleep again. \n\nLack of sleep and anxiety are a terrible combo, I feel drained the whole day a head of me. Drained in a way that I am incapable of feeling an once of joy during the day to a point that the really bad thoughts comes back; I have done a lot of work in therapy to recognize this and I am able to handle it for the amount of energy that requires of me impacts my work, my school and my extracurriculars.\n\nFor the last two weeks I have been woke up at least four times, and giving the nature of my crappy job i don\u2019t have time to recharge or I can call in sick because it\u2019s going to be money out of my paycheck that for other reasons I desperately need. \n\nLast night was the same situation, I got upset and when to the living room and started to watch a show in my laptop. My boyfriend came to the living room and ask me to come back to bed; I did and I stayed there in silence until it was time for me to go to work.\n\nI had an appointment earlier today that I couldn\u2019t manage my self to go because of the anxiety.\n\nI am desperate in here, I mentioned  my boyfriend that he should go to the doctor and get a reason why he cannot sleep but he insist he wants to deal with it naturally.\n\nI will admit that I left the house upset today. I have a whole 8 hours shift ahead of me. One essay to write, and a test to write but I am barely capable to put sentences together.\n\nI am considering spending the night in an Airbnb or a hotel but I don\u2019t want to create a conflict. I literally just want to sleep to feel my self again.\n\nEdit: \n\nHey guys, I wasn\u2019t expecting this level of response and I am very grateful for that. \nSince I made this post my manager send me home because he noticed I wasn\u2019t well. I came home and have a discussion with my boyfriend. \nI took some notes from the comments and we have arrange some solutions, some more immediate and alternative plans. \n\nHe agreed on checking with the doctor to get some better advice. I compromised to watch tv in the living room instead on bed for a couple of days to give it a try. We both agree that our sleeping dynamics will need some work but we are both willing to do it. \n\nHe apologized for the whole thing, I explained him the dimension of my anxiety and how extrapolated to the rest of my life. \n\nFor those arguing that my intrusive thoughts are mostly the issue (which it is partially) I guess that when you live 26 years in a country in war there are\nsome scarfs that never leave.\nPlease count your blessing", "created_utc": 1671034233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zluy81/wibta_if_i_spent_the_night_at_a_hotel/", "score": 474, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re not the AH for wanting to get a good nights sleep but YTA for saying your boyfriend is the one with sleeping problems when it\u2019s very clearly you. Let\u2019s break this down. \n\n1. Your boyfriend wants total darkness. This is completely normal. No sleeping problems here. \n2. He doesn\u2019t want the TV on. Also very normal. A lot of studies have actually proven that sleeping with the TV on is detrimental to the quality of sleep you get, so you wake up feeling more tired than if the TV had been off. No sleeping problems here, actually this is a very healthy sleeping mindset. \n3. A podcast as background noise. A lot of people use background noises (such as white noise or meditation apps) to fall asleep. He happens to use audiobooks. Now I will say, this is the best place to compromise, so if the audiobooks are keeping you up, try white noise. \n4. 30 minutes of reading. Studies show you shouldn\u2019t use any blue light devices (ie phones or TV) for at least 30 minutes if not longer before going to sleep.

If you get woken up by that and then can\u2019t fall asleep for hours after, that\u2019s not our boyfriends sleeping issues, that is yours.\n\nYou are the only one that has sleep issues that need to be addressed", ">I mentioned my boyfriend that he should go to the doctor and get a reason why he cannot sleep but he insist he wants to deal with it naturally.\n\n~~He has serious sleep problems, his \"natural\" solutions require 4 artificial events that don't occur in \"nature\" to happen for him to~~ *~~potentially~~* ~~sleep~~.
