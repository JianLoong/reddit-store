Should you have? Nope, not at all, absolutely no. Your daughter's experiences at the school was worse than basic bullying. That wheelchair is an extension of her body. They were taking away her ability to do things for herself by grabbing the chair and pushing it. They were forcing her to be completely helpless by taking the chair.\n\nYour wife is a sexist, ableist asshole and you gave her what she deserves.  \n\nGood for you!", "NTA. You\u2019re defending your child and placing them above your SO, which is the right choice always. That said, advocacy is about GOING to the school board (or board of trustees for private school, parish priest for parochial school) and DEMANDING they do something about the fact that your daughter was being bullied, the school was notified repeatedly, and the staff did NOTHING about it. Even if JJ doesn\u2019t return to the school, do something about it so that this doesn\u2019t keep happening to the next kid that ends up being bullied.", "NTA (as written here at least).

The changes she will endure will last a lifetime, such is the world, but if she's has someone who looks out for her like you are she's is going to be just fine. She will have the confidence to go forth and find those people that will enrich her life and if it's not at that school it'll be at the next one.

Mental health is a need.", "NTA. Who cares if your wife has the \"golden girl\" reputation with that school. Obviously that school sucks because it allows bullying to go unchecked. The \"boys will be boys\" mentality ends up causing the \"How did this happen?\" bs school's cry out when the worst happens because of their negligence.\n\nDo what you must to protect your daughter and allow her to thrive in live.

No outstanding reputation is worth more than the daughter's wellbeing; emotionally, mentally & physically. \nIf the bullying is so bad already, and nothing is being done by the school to help, could you imagine if the bullying escalated & became physical, and the daughter was harmed.

Also, if OPs wife had such an outstanding effect within the secondary school, why isn't more being done by the school.", "NTA in any way shape or form. Your child\u2019s well being was important and it sounds to me like your wife being upset was all about her and not about your daughter\u2019s well being at all.

I am disabled (not handicapped, disabled) and there were times during my school years when I wish my parents had taken me out and homeschooled me due to the bullying I received.

You stood up for your daughter and that means more than anything in the world. You\u2019re definitely a very loving and attentive mother who will move heaven and earth to provide whatever you need to for your daughters happiness and well being.

Anyone that tries to put anything, especially something as stupid as \"but *I* went to this school!\" ahead of her wellbeing is in the wrong.", "NTA in the slightest!! i'm disabled too and i know her pain, i hope she feels better at her new school", "this needs to be higher up. i dont know the law in the uk as well as the law in the us, but this should NOT be tolerated by the school. even if the law has no clear answer on whether this is legally assault, it is assault. this is something you need to look into, u/solitaire_19, for the sake of your daughters safety. her wheelchair is her mobility. like said above, it is literally an extension of herself. many disabled people consider our mobility aids, assistive devices, and medical equipment as parts of our bodies. i know this post is moreso about your fight with your wife, but i cannot stress this enough. if you have the means, i encourage persuing this legally. good luck to you and your family.", "Find better friends **AND** a better spouse", " NTA- You are every bully victims dream father. thank you for standing up for her when no one else would", "Nta. JJ is probably depressed (or dealing with major mental stuffs) from her paralysis and now the bullying? Switch school n try to make JJ as happy as possible. Ur doing the right thing- don\u2019t let anyone tell u differently", "NTA: Yikes! Amy sounds like a very cold person. Since she\u2019s a surgeon, she\u2019s living up their their detached, a-hole reputation. Amy and her friends all suck! Being a doctor doesn\u2019t always gift someone with empathy. Your disabled daughter is who matters most. Also, most private schools suck when it comes to disability accommodations. Public schools are better in that way.", "Nope, very appropriate reaction on your part. Don't let her back without apologizing to your daughter. I would say do not let her back in, period but I digress. And boys will be boys is such a disgusting mindset.\n\nNTA", "My own mother had to go to bat for my brother, who is disabled and in school, was being bullied by a damn teacher. Do what's right for your child. Who cares about the school. They had their chance to fix it. They didn't.\n\nI can't imagine how crushing this change in behaviour towards her must make her feel. Even if the school did intervene, maybe going to another school and having a fresh start is for the best. So then shes around people who only know her as she is now and won't have to deal with being insulted by people who she probably used to consider friendly. Nta", "Just because she is a general surgeon doesn't mean she knows Jack about spine surgery. Spine surgery is a very niche field. I worked for a world renowned spinal surgeon, he was amazing! I saw him help people that I would have never thought he could. Including my daughter. It sounds like your daughters T4 vertebral disc probably ruptured from expulsion, and either severed her spinal cord, or caused the spinal cord to be flattened. Damaging the nerves. I am so very sorry your daughter went through that!! \nYour wife seems to be more concerned with her reputation than your daughter. Good for you for standing up for your daughter. She needs you now more than ever", "NTA\n\nYour child comes first.  Good on you going mama bear mode.  Your (hopefully ex) partner and friends?  Hard TA.", "NTA\u2026.your partner wants you to force your child to be abused every day for some \u201cprestige of having gone to this school\u201d? What the hell is that? I will tell you from someone who was severely bullied it took decades of therapy to get over how none of the adults in my life helped me from being tormented even with recordings of how bad other kids would be. I was just left to deal and it still will pop into my mind instances of being bullied as a kid. \n\nPlease move your kid to a better school and please lose your partner over this abhorrent behavior.", "NTA", "NTA. If your wife really wanted her to go to that school, then she should have raised hell when the bullying first started and actually defended your daughter. \n\nBut now is too late. It's been a month, and your daughter has suffered nonstop bullying and physical assaults, with no teacher so much as twitching a finger to stop it. The school's ableism is disgusting - and so is your wife's. Her reputation and fond memories are not more important than your daughter's experience in the here and now. \n\nAnd no, she doesn't get more of a say in your daughter's life just because she's a surgeon and your daughter is disabled. She refused to take on legal responsibility for her stepdaughter when the two of you married, and even if she had done that, you would still have the primary say in your daughter's wellbeing.", "thank you i will definitely look into that", "thank you so much for saying this, it really did make me feel better. as for talking to JJ, we spent a lot of last evening talking and she said that as long as Amy is \u201cbeing a fucking bitch\u201d she doesn\u2019t want her in the house", "thank you very much, we\u2019re going well", "wow i had no idea this was a thing!! i am definitely going to bring it to their attention", "wow i\u2019m so so sorry you had to experience that, it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking that this is an issue that even has to be looked at, i hope you are doing better now x", "i hadn\u2019t thought of online school, i will definitely check it out. one of the schools i\u2019ve emailed work\u2019s especially with children that are disabled, and i know of some children who go there already. i will definitely try enrol her in some clubs for kids in chairs, that seems like a great suggestion", "thank you, i really hope she does too", "thank you so much, i am a woman though \ud83d\ude02", "i will definitely look into that, if i\u2019m honest i didn\u2019t even know you could do such a thing until now", "your absolutely correct, my wife and i are already talking about separating", "NTA (as written here at least). I'm having a bit of trouble understaning Amy's motivation here", "i kept making this point to her right after the accident, neither of us knew anything and it was selfish of her to suggest otherwise", "Grade 9 only came in a few years ago? How old is your wife?", "Nta. Your child was absolutely being bullied and it absolutely is and would affect mental health. I don\u2019t care who went to what school, that school isn\u2019t working out for your daughter. Continuing doing what\u2019s best for your child.", "NTA. Report that school and all its staff to some higher educational body. I would say also to report to media and get them famous, but that might put unwanted pressure on your kid. As for the wife....", "sorry mother!! \ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6", "...When did she graduate? Because unless we're talking about International Baccalaureate, the number grading system for GCSEs has only come in in the last eight years. \n\nSo your wife would be 24 now, at the oldest? How has she managed a 5 year degree plus 2 year Foundation programme plus 2 year core surgical training (and I'm not even counting specialist training!), all in the six years since A-levels?", "Yeah this makes no sense. Given the wives age, she would have been at the time when GCSE's were A-F", "Yeah, at best she\u2019s fresh out of a 3 year uni but that means she wouldn\u2019t be a surgeon but doing a placement rotation for her further medical education. \n\nUnless this is the daughter who only really knows the new numerical grades", "And OP is suddenly silent."]}
