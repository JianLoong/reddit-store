Any partner who wants you to choose them over your child is a red flag and does not have your child's best interest at heart.", "NTA. Could you have handled dealing with your wife better? Sure. Should you have? Nope, not at all, absolutely no. Your daughter's experiences at the school was worse than basic bullying. That wheelchair is an extension of her body. They were taking away her ability to do things for herself by grabbing the chair and pushing it. They were forcing her to be completely helpless by taking the chair.\n\nYour wife is a sexist, ableist asshole and you gave her what she deserves.  \n\nGood for you!", "NTA. You\u2019re defending your child and placing them above your SO, which is the right choice always. That said, advocacy is about GOING to the school board (or board of trustees for private school, parish priest for parochial school) and DEMANDING they do something about the fact that your daughter was being bullied, the school was notified repeatedly, and the staff did NOTHING about it. Even if JJ doesn\u2019t return to the school, do something about it so that this doesn\u2019t keep happening to the next kid that ends up being bullied.", "NTA (as written here at least).  I'm having a bit of trouble understaning Amy's motivation here -- why would she want your daughter to stay where she's miserable?", "Your one job now is to be the mother of the year/decade for that little girl and by all means you are off to the right start. The changes she will endure will last a lifetime, such is the world, but if she's has someone who looks out for her like you are she's is going to be just fine. She will have the confidence to go forth and find those people that will enrich her life and if it's not at that school it'll be at the next one. You and your SO have some things to workout but your mindset to care for your child can never be wrong. Thanks for being a great mom, good luck \ud83e\udd1e\n\nEdited: cause I can't read and OP is gonna be the most badass mom, I can tell \ud83d\ude01", "NTA, your daughter deserves to be in an environment where she isn't constantly harassed and bullied by her peers.", "NTA. And it is very weird that you pulling your child from an unhealthy situation is basically being taken as a personal insult to your wife.  Why is she so invested?  So strange.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing precisely the right thing.  Your daughter JJ's mental health is far more important than your wife's pride.\n\nIf you wife is a good mother, she would understand JJ's mental health is irreplaceable.  JJ does not need to be traumatized so your wife can feel good about herself.\n\nI advise marriage counseling here, because if your wife is seriously putting \"having JJ at My Beloved School is more important than her mental health\" I'd wonder if the marriage is worth keeping.\n\nWhen you're a parent, **YOUR KIDS NEEDS ALWAYS COME FIRST**.  Mental health is a need.", "NTA. Who cares if your wife has the \"golden girl\" reputation with that school. Obviously that school sucks because it allows bullying to go unchecked. The \"boys will be boys\" mentality ends up causing the \"How did this happen?\" bs school's cry out when the worst happens because of their negligence.\n\nDo what you must to protect your daughter and allow her to thrive in live. If people can't understand that then they are WRONG. Not just logically wrong but morally too.", "Nta. You protected your daughter and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. I don\u2019t understand what your wife\u2019s deal is. Why is her old reputation more important than your daughters mental health?", "NTA\nYou're doing what is best for the overall health of your daughter. Legally, you have more say in the situation than your wife. The wife, who decided not to become legal guardian is TA. No outstanding reputation is worth more than the daughter's wellbeing; emotionally, mentally & physically. \nIf the bullying is so bad already, and nothing is being done by the school to help, could you imagine if the bullying escalated & became physical, and the daughter was harmed. How would the wife's golden girl reputation help remedy a situation like that? Also, if OPs wife had such an outstanding effect within the secondary school, why isn't more being done by the school.", "NTA in any way shape or form. Your child\u2019s well being was important and it sounds to me like your wife being upset was all about her and not about your daughter\u2019s well being at all. If she actually has a good relationship with your daughter, she would care more about how traumatic recent events have been to JJ instead of her boys will be boys stand on the situation. I\u2019m sorry but it seems to me like she doesn\u2019t care all that much. Good on you for standing by your girl!", "NTA. Dump her immedietly because that is her true colors, whoever she was before was a facade, It's only gonna get worse from here. Your daughter does not deserve to be bullied that way and nothing happened to the bullies either who seriously lack empathy because it was an accident and can happen to everyone.", "NTA, SOOOOO N T A!!!!  \n\n\nHonestly if I were you I'd be consulting a lawyer about the school and looking at a lawsuit or other options because Oh Hell No!!!! Your wife can go pound sand I'd divorce over this, maybe use the same lawyer for both and go scorched earth.", "Absolutely nta.  Child first. Bullies never.  Shitty school employees need to be reported to the board of education at next meeting.  Problem is,what is the plan for new school and to keep this from happening again.  Serious question.  Gotta have a plan friend.", "NTA. I am disabled (not handicapped, disabled) and there were times during my school years when I wish my parents had taken me out and homeschooled me due to the bullying I received. Being disabled is HARD, especially going from abled to disabled. (I have no experience in the latter but I\u2019ve gone from not knowing I was disabled to disabled to more disabled and it\u2019s crushing.)\n\nI highly suggest finding a NFP for disabled people. Here, you\u2019ll find resources for therapy , activities and she\u2019ll find friends like herself.", "NTA and WAY TO GO MAMA BEAR! You\u2019re a rock star! You stood up for your daughter and that means more than anything in the world. You\u2019re definitely a very loving and attentive mother who will move heaven and earth to provide whatever you need to for your daughters happiness and well being. You let her know that she comes before all else and that you will always be that strong shoulder for her to lean on. You\u2019ve shown her that you\u2019re not only her mother but her best friend, her biggest cheerleader, and her champion. You\u2019ve shown her that when anything goes wrong that you will always have her back! I want to be you when I grow up and I\u2019m already 45F! LOL\n\nAs for your wife, she sounds like she\u2019s more concerned about her own ego and reputation than about your daughter. You have some serious thinking to do and maybe you can talk to your daughter about how she feels about the situation? You\u2019ve shown her that\u2019ll you\u2019ll choose her above everyone else and she may be uncomfortable living in the house with Amy after how Amy reacted. It\u2019s coming across that she has bullies at school and may have a bully at home too.", "ESH.

You\u2019re obviously a great mom \ud83d\ude03", "Sorry your daughter had to go through that...i hope she finds better friends at her new school.", "OK. Yeah see in the States, I think 95% of parents would be livid if their kid was being treated like that in school, and many would not hesitate to pull them out.

As the stepparent she needs to stay in her lane.", "thank you very much, it honestly means so much hearing that x", "thank you, i really hope so too. i have gotten in contact with a school in our county that caters specifically for disabled children, and JJ really likes the sound of it, so hopefully all goes to plan!"]}
