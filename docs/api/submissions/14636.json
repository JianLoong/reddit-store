I'm like your wife, I LOVE going to WDW (not Disneyland, but almost the same), if I could I'd go every year, but I can't because of money, I also live in another continent (bummer) and that makes it harder for me to go.\n\nWhile I completely understand that you don't like Disney or Disneyland and it's a valid reason, if your wife truly loves going and your kids do too, and it does not interfere with your annual vacation or your money, then don't stop them from going. Your MIL can pay for everything right now (except you, but it might also be because you actually don't like going there), but there might be a time when she can't and then your wife will be affected by it, your kids too. And since you don't like it there, she won't get to go every year anymore... I just don't think telling her not to go is going to aid your marriage in any way. She's going to resent your for it, especially if what I'm saying happens someday.\n\nLet me give you an example. I'm going to WDW this year, I haven't been there since 2019. No one is going with me though, I won't beg anyone to go with me just because I love it there, if someone wants to join in, that's cool, but it's my joy, my money, my time. I'm not exactly affecting anyone here, though I've had people tell me not to go, but  it's my choice. The same goes for your wife, though in this case, the money comes from her MIL.\n\nPlan something else, a weekend trip somewhere, something that you enjoy and can share with your kids. Trekking, for example, museums, visiting nearby cities, camping. You can get your girls excited with that, and you can also ask for your wife's input... just don't ruin that trip, it's not going to help you in any way.\n\nI truly hope you think of something that all of your family can enjoy!", "NTA I'm with you, Dad. I'm so with you. Growing up my parents always did the same vacation every year. Now I'm appreciative that we went on vacation at all but I decided that when I had my own kids I wanted to explore new places each year. My husband sometimes doesn't understand why I'm not into revisiting a place we really liked. That said, this is a tradition that your wife likes and it doesn't require you to go or spend money. So let her go with the girls every year and you plan and fund a Disney-free, MIL-free trip in addition. You can't ask her not to go just because you're not part of those memories for your kids. They'll remember their special girls trip with mom and grandma, and they'll remember dad's camping trips. That's ok.", "NTA because Disney adults are 1000% cringe. Also your comment on Disney princess culture being gross is bang on. Stand strong, OP!", "I'm torn because on one side, you clearly dislike Disney and wouldn't be a good companion on that trip. It sounds like your wife and kids get a good trip with grandma each year - which a lot of kids never get. Plus, you don't have to go which aligns with your anti-disney views. But, at the same time, I understand the desire to take a family trip - mom, dad, and the kids. With how long your wife and her mom have been taking this yearly trip (you said prior to you entering her life), I don't think it's fair to ask her to give that up. But I do think it's fair for you two to plan something as a couple for you guys and your kids. Even small day trips work. I guess you just need to find middle ground and compromise.\n\nOn a side note - I understand disliking the consumerism of Disney, but maybe do a little research on some of the newer characters. There are a lot of strong characters who set better examples for kids nowadays. It's not the typical damsel in distress Disney anymore.", "My grandson is sick of Disneyland. Both of his parents keep dragging him there and he\u2019s tired of it.", "NTA - I get why this is important to your wife, I'm sure she has tremendously valuable memories associated with this place and wants to share that with her kids. So I understand why this is important to her. However, I also understand all of the reasons you listed against going to Disney every year.\n\nYou and your wife need to reach a compromise, in which both partners feel their wishes have been heard and understood by the other. I do think that (based on your description) your wife seems to be making more demands and seems less willing to compromise. You deserve a say in where your family goes on vacation. If you can't agree, maybe it'd be fair to alternate every other year who get's to pick where the family goes on vacation? Perhaps she will find there are other ways ways to give your daughters the feelings and experiences that your wife associated with Disney, outside of going on that same specific park?", "NTA, but it's borderline E-S-H. The reason I give you more credit than your wife is because you are offering a bit of a compromise while she is trying to dictate the vacation every year.\n\nFor your part, keep communicating and be willing to bend a little further, but your wife really needs to take at least a small step to you if this is going to work.", "ESH\n\nYou can't be forced to go, but she can't be forced to not go.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpilt whatever holiday budget you have in half .. let her use her halff, and take your kids to a vacation with your half.

Godspeed.", "YTA.\n\nYou choose not to go with your wife. It isn't reasonable to demand that she and the kids not go with their mom (although I do think she's also TA for not paying for you).

Unfortunately, you married a Disney Adult, and are now paying the price.", "When my kids were young, we did Disney a couple of times (and it was fine) then I decided I'd like to see some real cities.  There are some great vacations out there that don't have to be scripted and fake or even particularly expensive.  If you are going to Disneyland (California), try San Diego or San Francisco.  SF in particular is very public transportation friendly and has lots of activities you can do for free or low cost.  Take bikes across the Golden Gate bridge, hit up the farmers' market for breakfast, hike up Coit Tower for the view or visit the kid friendly museums.

I'd argue that your MIL is the AH in this scenario because she's putting you in the position of being the bad guy by saying that you can only come if you pay, but covering your wife and children.\n\nGreat, the kids are getting some fun core memories but without dad. That's kind of messed up.", "Going against the grain with NTA. If money is tight and you can't afford to join them since g'ma clearly doesn't want you there (given she won't pay for you to go even though you are part of the family), then I get feeling left out of family vacations. Wife should be willing to compromise and do it every other year and on the off years you four can do something else as a family.", "> I don't think Disney princess culture is great for young girls \n\nLol.

And even if he was invited (with MIL paying for him) he wouldn't want to go, isn't that the point?\n\nAnd he can't say his family can't go, as I explained in my reply. They're going to resent him for it, so it's better he saves his money for something with his family, as I said before.", "Yeah I don\u2019t care. It completely eludes me why any adult would subject themselves to a children\u2019s theme park when literally any other vacation option is on the table. Call me old-fashioned, I guess.", "I get that but it seems the wife isn't going to let that happen so might as well put the time they're at Disney to good use.", "I think he would rather do something else for vacation than teaching the kids that \u201cvacation means going with mom to Disney \u201c", "Considering Disneyland is in CA I would imagine the costs are higher and last time I was there it was expensive as fuck for 2, let alone 3.", "Yes but he has to pay for part of it, taking a chunk of the money he would rather use to save up for a vacation with everyone", "A lot of adults go because they never got to go as kids because either they had parents who hated Disney/theme parks or they couldn\u2019t afford to and it\u2019s realizing a dream.", "Actually, World is generally more expensive because they are trying to keep people away.", "Right? He sounds insufferable, and frankly like a mansplainer.", " No, he admits in another comment it\u2019s not expensive, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t like Disney and thinks his wife and kids shouldn\u2019t go.", "Yeah, exactly. That's what I mean.", "This. This is the comment that cemented you\u2019re the asshole after all. \n\nSo your real issue isn\u2019t the vacation, it\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s just that you want to be in control of your wife and daughters\u2019 hobbies and be always present in their life. Not allowed to have a life without you, or interests that you don\u2019t deem worthy. \n\nHow ironic that someone against \u201cprincess culture\u201d (aka female heroines, because if you watched any recent Disney movies, you\u2019d realize they\u2019re actually all about women lead characters) is actually also someone with deep rooted misogyny and control issues. Couldn\u2019t have seen that one coming, real shocker. /s\n\nUltimately you don\u2019t agree with your wife\u2019s interest, for no other reason than \u201cI don\u2019t really get it\u201d and you don\u2019t want your children exposed to something you don\u2019t personally enjoy. You\u2019re admitting you COULD plan a cheaper family vacation every yr like camping, but you never HAVE. And that the real thing is you don\u2019t like that your wife and kids are involved in something without you. \n\nOnly assholes don\u2019t allow their kids and wives hobbies and a life outside their own. If you want to go camping with the kids, do it. Nothing is stopping the kids from going every yr to Disney with Mom and Camping with Dad. You wouldn\u2019t even have to lose vacation PTO days to the Disney trip, and could do an even longer camping trip with the girls! \n\nMost people would see their MIL paying for a free vacation every yr as a complete win. You don\u2019t have to attend, you barely have to finance it, and you don\u2019t lose PTO days. If the $<500 is such an issue every yr, tell your wife to start budgeting or your MIL to cover everything. I bet they would. \n\nYou only care since your real issue is again, the lack of control over their lives. \n\nGet over it.", "How is camping not vacation with little kids?", "Wow damn I mean I know some people can\u2019t deal with nature but my family went camping every year when I was a kid, probably in the same way the wife here went to Disney. If you genuinely think that camping isn\u2019t a vacation then you take families who don\u2019t have a grandma willing to pay for Disney every year and treat them like they never go on real vacations. I personally have been to Disney world twice, and if you think camping with kids is hard try hauling them around a packed theme park through busses with overpriced merchandise and food and saying that counts as \u201cvacation\u201d", "He doesn\u2019t want to talk to them or to get it. I doubt he\u2019s watched any Disney movies. He wants to be in control."]}
