I'm like your wife, I LOVE going to WDW (not Disneyland, but almost the same), if I could I'd go every year, but I can't because of money, I also live in another continent (bummer) and that makes it harder for me to go.\n\nWhile I completely understand that you don't like Disney or Disneyland and it's a valid reason, if your wife truly loves going and your kids do too, and it does not interfere with your annual vacation or your money, then don't stop them from going. Your MIL can pay for everything right now (except you, but it might also be because you actually don't like going there), but there might be a time when she can't and then your wife will be affected by it, your kids too. And since you don't like it there, she won't get to go every year anymore... I just don't think telling her not to go is going to aid your marriage in any way. She's going to resent your for it, especially if what I'm saying happens someday.\n\nLet me give you an example. I'm going to WDW this year, I haven't been there since 2019. No one is going with me though, I won't beg anyone to go with me just because I love it there, if someone wants to join in, that's cool, but it's my joy, my money, my time. I'm not exactly affecting anyone here, though I've had people tell me not to go, but  it's my choice. The same goes for your wife, though in this case, the money comes from her MIL.\n\nPlan something else, a weekend trip somewhere, something that you enjoy and can share with your kids. Trekking, for example, museums, visiting nearby cities, camping. You can get your girls excited with that, and you can also ask for your wife's input... just don't ruin that trip, it's not going to help you in any way.\n\nI truly hope you think of something that all of your family can enjoy!", "NTA I'm with you, Dad. I'm so with you. Growing up my parents always did the same vacation every year. Now I'm appreciative that we went on vacation at all but I decided that when I had my own kids I wanted to explore new places each year. My husband sometimes doesn't understand why I'm not into revisiting a place we really liked. That said, this is a tradition that your wife likes and it doesn't require you to go or spend money. So let her go with the girls every year and you plan and fund a Disney-free, MIL-free trip in addition. You can't ask her not to go just because you're not part of those memories for your kids. They'll remember their special girls trip with mom and grandma, and they'll remember dad's camping trips. That's ok.", "NTA because Disney adults are 1000% cringe. Also your comment on Disney princess culture being gross is bang on. Stand strong, OP!", "I'm torn because on one side, you clearly dislike Disney and wouldn't be a good companion on that trip. It sounds like your wife and kids get a good trip with grandma each year - which a lot of kids never get. Plus, you don't have to go which aligns with your anti-disney views. But, at the same time, I understand the desire to take a family trip - mom, dad, and the kids. With how long your wife and her mom have been taking this yearly trip (you said prior to you entering her life), I don't think it's fair to ask her to give that up. But I do think it's fair for you two to plan something as a couple for you guys and your kids. Even small day trips work. I guess you just need to find middle ground and compromise.\n\nOn a side note - I understand disliking the consumerism of Disney, but maybe do a little research on some of the newer characters. There are a lot of strong characters who set better examples for kids nowadays. It's not the typical damsel in distress Disney anymore.", "My grandson is sick of Disneyland. Both of his parents keep dragging him there and he\u2019s tired of it.", "NTA - I get why this is important to your wife, I'm sure she has tremendously valuable memories associated with this place and wants to share that with her kids. So I understand why this is important to her. However, I also understand all of the reasons you listed against going to Disney every year.\n\nYou and your wife need to reach a compromise, in which both partners feel their wishes have been heard and understood by the other. I do think that (based on your description) your wife seems to be making more demands and seems less willing to compromise. You deserve a say in where your family goes on vacation. If you can't agree, maybe it'd be fair to alternate every other year who get's to pick where the family goes on vacation? Perhaps she will find there are other ways ways to give your daughters the feelings and experiences that your wife associated with Disney, outside of going on that same specific park?", "NTA, but it's borderline E-S-H. The reason I give you more credit than your wife is because you are offering a bit of a compromise while she is trying to dictate the vacation every year.\n\nFor your part, keep communicating and be willing to bend a little further, but your wife really needs to take at least a small step to you if this is going to work.", "ESH\n\nYou can't be forced to go, but she can't be forced to not go.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpilt whatever holiday budget you have in half .. let her use her halff, and take your kids to a vacation with your half.

Godspeed.", "YTA.\n\nYou choose not to go with your wife. It isn't reasonable to demand that she and the kids not go with their mom (although I do think she's also TA for not paying for you).

Unfortunately, you married a Disney Adult, and are now paying the price.", "When my kids were young, we did Disney a couple of times (and it was fine) then I decided I'd like to see some real cities.  There are some great vacations out there that don't have to be scripted and fake or even particularly expensive.  If you are going to Disneyland (California), try San Diego or San Francisco.  SF in particular is very public transportation friendly and has lots of activities you can do for free or low cost.  Take bikes across the Golden Gate bridge, hit up the farmers' market for breakfast, hike up Coit Tower for the view or visit the kid friendly museums.

I'd argue that your MIL is the AH in this scenario because she's putting you in the position of being the bad guy by saying that you can only come if you pay, but covering your wife and children.\n\nGreat, the kids are getting some fun core memories but without dad. That's kind of messed up.", "Going against the grain with NTA. If money is tight and you can't afford to join them since g'ma clearly doesn't want you there (given she won't pay for you to go even though you are part of the family), then I get feeling left out of family vacations. Wife should be willing to compromise and do it every other year and on the off years you four can do something else as a family.", "> I don't think Disney princess culture is great for young girls \n\nLol.

I personally think Disney is a huge money pit and doesn\u2019t teach your kids anything valuable. I actually think it\u2019s the antithesis of culture and the peak of brainwashed capitalism.

Paying for a single family room may be what's in her budget.", "Why would she waste her money on a wet blanket?", "I don't disagree with you about Disney.\n\nMy point is if someone was going to pay for me to go and all I did was say how horrible Disney was, that someone would likely be reluctant to extend an invitation to pay for him to come. (I wonder if she paid for him the first year)\n\nImagine the trip, him complaining and denigrating Disney the entire time.  MIL, Wife and kids would all be made miserable by him.\n\nETA Take Disney out of the equation.  \nWould you pay for someone to join you scuba diving if they vocally hate swimming  \nWould you offer to pay for someone to Go to an art museum if they hate art(or that particular type of art?)", "Who would?", "The trip to Disney costs money, as the grandmother doesn't cover all expenses. This dude can't have a nice enough vacation because his wife goes every year to Disney. He says that money is short right now, so his wife is going away every single year to spend money that they could be saving to have a vacation in wich all family is included and that he, a member of the family that works for money to enter the family, can also enjoy.\n\nThe wife is being incredible selfish by denying her own husband a vacation he can also enjoy with his family. She is the one throwing a fit because he wants to go to another place for one year.", "Nobody says you have to plan it on your own, just that it doesn't make sense if you're not paying for the whole disney trip to take it away from the rest of your family. \n\nFigure out where you want to go and bring your wife into the planning process, and let them have their disney experiences be their thing on the side. It's a healthy approach to demonstrating to your children that a relationship doesn't mean you always have to do everything the other person wants to do - it's okay to do some things on your own or figure out ways to compromise so everyone is happy.", "We just bought Disney tickets for our 1 and only Disney trip. Tickets for 4 were 2000ish. Room was a gift but will be all 4 in a room. Driving. Food. All adds up. Your MIL is shelling a significant amount. Let your 3 members go but cap how much you as a family can spend. Then, talk to the wife and plan a vacation you would enjoy", "You don't have to plan a trip completely without her input. You could get a rough idea of what you want, scout out prices, activities, and food at the location and then present your wife/family with a plan that they then sign off on.", "And I think it's become important because of values. I'm not in line with Disney mentality (which I may be misrepresenting in my head) and I also think we should be together as a family unit.", "Oh yeah like I said OP paying for the room with their wife is not a odd request. In fact 4 tickets may be what's in her budget as well. It's not a bad deal paying for room, travel, and 1 ticket if it's affordable.", "This is exactly right, thanks", "She doesn't have to. It might not even be in her budget. Only having to but one ticket and accommodations is a steak for a Disney trip. I guess I was trying to see if OP was being excluded for an unfair reason. She may just not want to buy tickets for someone who's complains the trip.", "What came first though, OP complaining about Disney or MIL refusing to pay for him? \"Disney is my whole personality\" adults are insufferable though.", ">This dude can't have a nice enough vacation because his wife goes every year to Disney. \n\nWhile the Disney trips does obviously cost them some money, it sounded like he was saying (in the post) that he couldn't afford a holiday for the whole family every year.. but could afford to join on the Disney trip. Though it would prevent him from saving for a holiday he actually wants. He's already not going on the Disney trips and therefore being able to put the majority of that holiday money aside.", "Look, you married a Disney adult. If you don't agree with Disney values (which I don't think are good values, but hey, there are certainly worse ones!), try to impart other values to your kids by involving them in stuff that's important to you.\n\nI went on trips with my mom and grandma a lot as a kid because my dad couldn't take time off work. (They weren't as fun as Disney trips, but still.) My dad never resented that time I spent with my mom and grandma and siblings without him, and he enjoyed a few days of peace and quiet without us kids running around. Of course I wish I had more vacations with my dad! But I still don't think it's right to take away the Disney trips given the relatively very low cost to your family that y'all pay for them to get a lot of enjoyment out of. You can still step up and plan some family trips, or some dad + kids trips too.", "And that's why YTA. Sounds like you're looking to get divorced.", "As an adult who grew up with parents who were pretty uncomfortable with the whole Disney princess thing, just talk to them about it, and they'll get it. The newer princesses (pretty much Mulan and up) aren't problematic in the same way the older ones were. Talk to them about how the older ones are a product of their time, and they'll get it. You can also reframe the lessons. For example, Cinderella can become a story about how people who want you to hide who you are don't have your best interests at heart instead of about waiting for a prince to rescue you", "He doesn't actually mention having to cover the travel in the post, but I assumed he would. I think he's got a pretty sweet deal. And if he chooses not to spend that vacation money on joining them, he can use it for a camping trip. I know those kids don't only have 1 week of holiday (from school) a year!", "I mean MIL might not be able to afford to pay for him. We don\u2019t know if she\u2019s \u201crefusing.\u201d", "That's true they could do a camping trip if the kids enjoy it at another time."]}
