The fact that none of them offered proper ID was totally unprofessional. The fact that when they didn't find anything they did not apologize was completely rude. If they are a chain store you should contact their central office and complain.", "NTA - I would be freaked out if people came up to me with no way of proving they were actual workers at the store demanding to look at my bags. You got proof they weren't scammers, then did as they asked. You definitely shouldn't shop there again if their manager was yelling at people in the parking lot!", "I would have refused because if someone wants to look in MY bag, they better be sure they\u2019re going to find something. With security and cameras everywhere there\u2019s no excuse for this kind of behavior because if they saw you take something, they wouldn\u2019t be asking. NTA", "NTA, you had no idea who these people were. they could have been scamming you with all intentions of running off with your phone or wallet. if they dont want people questioning them, they should wear something identifying, like a name tag.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t put it past a thief to try to steal someone\u2019s wallet this way.  Asking for ID is completely reasonable.  They should have been wearing some sort of ID to begin with.  They should also be very careful with accusations.  Being accused of shoplifting is a big deal, embarrassing, and I would never shop there again.  I would also let all of my friends know and post it on as many review sites as possible.  Putting your phone back in your purse vs. stealing is something they should be able to differentiate.  If not they are going to have a lot of seriously pissed off customers.", "NTA. It's better to trust your instincts and be wrong. I'm not sure if you're in the US, but the laws here are that security guards have no extra authority beyond that of any normal citizen. They can do a citizen's arrest if they see you breaking certain laws. They can act on the behalf of the property owner and ask you to leave. While it may not do any harm to just open the bag and let the person look in, and I would comply personally if I was at a store I had an interest in staying friendly with, I would hesitate to comply to anything more than that.", "NTA\n\nRandom people I don\u2019t know looking through my belongings is not cool.", "NTA.

They were not very professional.  I'd write the corporate office not for being searched but beflcouse the were not dressed professionally or wearing ID.", "Let them search your bag on the condition that if they don\u2019t find anything they need to give you a $50 gift card.", "NTA especially since you consented to a search", "NTA. 3 employees didn't have any name tags? That wouldn't fly at any place I've worked or shopped. Name tags are part of the dress code and uniform. Better to be careful these days. People are shady and often clever.", "Not at all, and it sounds like a place I would never shop at again. I would definitely call or email their corporate office and tell them they have a teachable moment on their hands.", "NTA. They are though. The manager should have had a badge on for sure. They wanted you to give them your purse but you couldn\u2019t tell if they were actual employees? Nope, I wouldn\u2019t have let them look in my purse either.", "NTA, and I second complaining to higher ups. They take that sorta thing seriously. A Walmart door greeter was once fired for demanding to search my bad bc I\u2019m obviously homeless. Super annoying, i hadn\u2019t stolen anything and she had no reason to ask. She even wanted to look in my ukulele case and seemed genuinely disappointed to only find a ukulele in there.", "NTA, wouldn\u2019t have let them search my bag or prevent me from leaving even if I knew for certain they were store employees. I do not consent. Just say \u2018no\u2019.", "nta", "I know right, I would've been terrified. I don't open my bag for someone unless they have a uniform on.", "Call the police.   Don't fuck around.", "Eh.  The police arent everyone's friend.\n\n  I get what your saying but they tend to be too full of prejudice and assumptions for that to be a guarantee of anything helpful, or nondangerous.", "What makes you think corporate is any more friendly?", "They arent going to shoot or arrest them?", "Neither are they going to side with OP.  I suppose we should just let it go.", "The whole not wearing a name tag is a tactic that they use to avoid being called out when you complain to corporate. When I worked retail, I had a manager tell us to do the same thing, however if you provide the exact time in your complaint, a simple CCTV lookup is easy to identify them. I'd call corporate and file a complaint. \n\nNTA", "I would have called my attorney if they insisted on an illegal search! Absolutely awful!", "NTA\n\nI let them look in my bag only when asked.", "NTA", "This. Further, they really shouldn't even ask to look unless they see you conceal an item that belongs to the store and maintain a visual on you from that point forward. At least that's the standard policy in most big box stores in the US.", "It\u2019s called shopkeeper\u2019s privilege and store owners and their representatives *do* have the right to limited attempts to prevent theft in the US", "Many stores have undercover security people. They're dressed like customers and appear to be shopping. \n\nThat doesn't excuse their inability to show ID to OP, but not everyone who works at every store is required to wear a name tag or adhere to the dress code.", "> You can sue them for false imprisonment. Talk to a lawyer.\n\nNo she probably couldn't, there is nothing in the post that infers they did detain the OP or tried to detain the OP", "I'd say it depends on the store. I work in a retail pharmacy, and if we see somebody stealing, we're not supposed to confront them or do anything; we're supposed to let them leave without doing anything. (I'd understand a different policy if it were, say, consumer electronics, fragrances, or luxury goods, though)", "Legally it is easier to write off the stolen item than deal with a lawsuit when an employee aggressively tries to stop someone from stealing.  \n\nIt sucks because it drives up the prices in the store, but when law enforcement won't do anything, what do you do? \ud83e\udd37", "At my old store, we were supposed to let the loss prevention guy know, and then let him and a manager deal with it.", "Yeah. When I worked in retail we were told that the stuff they stole was never worth more than our safety. So like even when ppl would walk out with a Nespresso or Keurig we just were told to remember as much detail as possible to pass of to the police and just let them go.\n\nETA that being the customer in this scenario, OP was absolutely in their rights to just walk out. A similar situation happened to me and I just walked out because I knew I didn\u2019t have anything i shouldn\u2019t. But I do understand that not everybody is that self assured in those situations.", "If they are in a big box store in the states, this is most likely against corporate policy. Most places require witnessed concealing of product(like certain it is the product and not could be a product), a visual maintained on the shopper from that point to the door, and the shopper passing the point of sale before confronting them. OP placed her phone in her purse. They never saw her conceal a product.", "You never know. Corporate tends to have policies designed to avoid lawsuits and they\u2019d probably be mad at the employees if they heard about it. They won\u2019t do anything drastic but OP might get an apology + a mark on the record of that store manager.", "NTA. Also, if they want to look through your bag, make them get the police. They have no authority to look through your belongings whether they think you stole something or not.", "NTA. You taught them a small lesson.", "Hi, I\u2019m a security guard as well as ex retail management. You are 100% NTA, and I would encourage you to call their customer service or corporate line and report what happened. Let them know a description of each employee, the exact time/date (to see who was scheduled), and everything that happened. \n\nThe thing is, unless they see you take an item off the shelf, conceal that item, and then attempt to leave the store- ALL OF WHICH needs to be seen the entire time without losing visuals on you- they should not have bothered you. This is the policy in every single store I\u2019ve ever worked in or worked for. The reason this rule is so consistent is because of situations like yours. They need to know, without a doubt, that you are stealing. \n\nAnd if you ARE stealing, they should never ever tell you to open your bag and let them search it. Thats wildly inappropriate. Especially in front of the store where people can see. People have sued for public humiliation over this before. But more likely, just complaining online and creating bad press.\n\nAnyways, please report them.", "They were giving you dirty looks because they were still convinced you stole something", "Definitely NTA. I would have done the same. \n\nI\u2019m giggling at the thought of asking for the manager\u2026. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No, you did the right thing. Safety first.", "I think this needs to be highlighted. They have no search warrant. You did not sign anything granting the store access to your personal items.", "What are the police going to do?", "Why? More expensive stuff isn\u2019t worth being hurt or dying for either.", "Yup. I work in a big retail store and here's the thing, it's not stealing until they walk out the door. Once they walk out the door they're no longer on the property and are in public and I would be risking a lot to confront them. Outside the door it's now for the police to handle. It's simply not worth anything any of us are getting paid as well. Let them go.", "Well yes, sure, but this was about managers and security not regular retail workers. With management and security, the general policy in 99% of stores is to maintain a visual on the thief the entire time to reduce liability.

It doesn't drive them up.  They already charge the most they can get away with charging. It's crazy to think they don't.", "True, that\u2019s a good point", "I think the assumption is someone who steals drugs from a pharmacy is more likely to turn violent than the people who shiplift at department stores.", "More people need to have this sort of attitude, to be honest. Went to clean behind the fryers one day, which involved moving the grill. When I pulled the thing out there was a flash of light from something short circuiting; Turned out the power cord had worn away a bit and fell into a puddle that'd formed behind it from the rain.\n\nI pushed it back and finished the rest of my shift doing anything else (after I told someone what happened). I ain't catching a few volts just so my boss can be happier about a part of the floor they can't even see. A guy came out and wrapped some electrical tape around it the same day, but I didn't go back there until he came back and replaced the cord entirely with a new one.\n\nThe wages they pay you aren't worth your life.

Some of those crazies used bear spray to get their Louis Vuitton. Even banks have a compliance policy with robbers/thieves.", "Seattle's super rich too with all the tech bros. They charge that much because people have the money to buy it.", "That is the Avacado milk down at Amazon's Whole foods.  I am talking 2%, not organic or grass-fed, either.\n\nLet's not forget that Dari Gold stopped making half gallons and now produces 59 oz.
