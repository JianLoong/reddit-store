I got a text from my husband and took my phone out of my bag, replied, and put it back in my handbag. As I was leaving the store a woman blocked my way and asked to look through my bag as she saw me put something in it (my phone). She was dressed in a blouse and pants, but had no name tag or anything with the stores name on her clothing. I asked if she worked there, and she said yes, then asked to look at my bag again. I hesitated, and said she didn't have any name tag. An older man walked up to us (wearing a polo and shorts) and she said he was the manager. The man then asked to look in my bag, but again, no name tag or identifying marks on his clothes. I had also seen the same man 10 minutes prior yelling at someone in the carpark. I refused, and then a second man approached, wearing a t-shirt that had 'security' on it. No walkie-talkie, badge, name tag, just t-shirt and shorts. He asked to look in my bag. At this point I sure this was a scam of some kind, and walked to the register. I asked the woman behind the counter if the original woman worked there and if the older man was her manager. The woman behind the counter confirmed their identities, and I showed them my bag before leaving the store. All three of them gave me dirty looks as I was leaving, and while at the time I felt justified, I am now wondering if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1679791347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1225aie/aita_for_asking_for_id_when_someone_wanted_to/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that none of them offered proper ID was totally unprofessional. The fact that when they didn't find anything they did not apologize was completely rude. If they are a chain store you should contact their central office and complain.", "NTA - I would be freaked out if people came up to me with no way of proving they were actual workers at the store demanding to look at my bags. You got proof they weren't scammers, then did as they asked. You definitely shouldn't shop there again if their manager was yelling at people in the parking lot!", "I would have refused because if someone wants to look in MY bag, they better be sure they\u2019re going to find something. With security and cameras everywhere there\u2019s no excuse for this kind of behavior because if they saw you take something, they wouldn\u2019t be asking. NTA", "NTA, you had no idea who these people were. they could have been scamming you with all intentions of running off with your phone or wallet. if they dont want people questioning them, they should wear something identifying, like a name tag.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t put it past a thief to try to steal someone\u2019s wallet this way.  Asking for ID is completely reasonable.  They should have been wearing some sort of ID to begin with.  They should also be very careful with accusations.  Being accused of shoplifting is a big deal, embarrassing, and I would never shop there again.  I would also let all of my friends know and post it on as many review sites as possible.  Putting your phone back in your purse vs. stealing is something they should be able to differentiate.  If not they are going to have a lot of seriously pissed off customers.", "NTA. It's better to trust your instincts and be wrong. I'm not sure if you're in the US, but the laws here are that security guards have no extra authority beyond that of any normal citizen. They can do a citizen's arrest if they see you breaking certain laws. They can act on the behalf of the property owner and ask you to leave. While it may not do any harm to just open the bag and let the person look in, and I would comply personally if I was at a store I had an interest in staying friendly with, I would hesitate to comply to anything more than that.", "NTA\n\nRandom people I don\u2019t know looking through my belongings is not cool.", "NTA. If you are going to do security things you need carry ID or something identifying you as someone empowered to do so. Period. And they can request all day long, it doesnt mean you have to submit. Even police need a search warrant.", "NTA report them to their higher ups. They should have nonproblem verifying identity.", "You can sue them for false imprisonment. Talk to a lawyer.", "NTA\nthis is something on the wrong day id Take to corporate", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
