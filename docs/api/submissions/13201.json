My store director had to lock herself in the cash room once after a situation went south. When they couldn\u2019t get her they came through my department and started throwing glass bottles before leaving.", "Prairie farms half gallon of heavy whipping cream is close to $9 in STL County. It's pretty horrendous.", "As someone who taught in Seattle, lived in the suburbs and still had to quit and move to a different career so that I could afford to pay my bills and save for my future, I can tell you that almost none of the teachers who worked in my public school could afford to live in the community they serviced. 80% of my students\u2019 families couldn\u2019t afford it. 25% of that 80% were living in cars or motels. I miss that job so much, but there were weeks where the city was late to pay me and I had to bus from the suburbs and walk over two miles because I couldn\u2019t afford $5.50 gas. Now I\u2019m doing work that means absolutely nothing, that helps literally no one, but hey, I can afford my groceries"]}
