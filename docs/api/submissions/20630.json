Makes the whole pool smell like wet dog.", "It's not just kids and/or dogs that pee in the water. I've seen adults stay in one spot too long! And besides, their is enough choline and chemicals that get put in the water that could kill the plague!!!!", "NTA, community pools should be human adult only tbh.\n\nPets are dirty and shed, no matter how well behaved. Small children pee no matter how well behaved, and older children are too often allowed to think a shared pool is a playground and interrupt others. \n\nTry to suggest adding a dog run to the development and a kiddie pool. If there is room and support you\u2019d have a fun supportive community without the nuances that negatively affect each group and singularly help just one.", "NTA\n\nI am a HUGE dog person and I wouldn\u2019t let my guys somewhere it wasn\u2019t expressly allowed.\n\nAlso your kids absolutely pee in the pool \ud83d\ude02", "I mean, I piss in the pool, it's especially fun from the high diving board.", "NAH honestly, with maybe a touch of YTA. \nIt's a community pool. I can almost guarantee that whatever was on that dog was nothing compared to the fetid cocktail of human skin, spit, snot, piss, what have you that is festering in that thing on a daily basis. Just move on and go about your day", "ESH. The likelyhood is that the dog is not supposed to be in the pool, so he shouldn't have had his dog in there. But you trying to convince anyone that kids don't pee in the pool is just laughable. If your young kids are in the pool for more than 10 minutes at a time, they've peed in the pool. I'm not saying this because I think poorly of you or your children, it is just how little ones are. Anyone that uses a public pool (should) be aware of the fact that small children have peed in it", "Are there rules that prohibit pets from the pool?  If there are, then they shouldn't be letting the dog in the pool.  If not, at least they didn't let the dog in the pool while you were in it.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather be in a pool with dogs instead of people.", "YTA.  What\u2019s wrong with a dog in the pool?", "Yta. If your kids pee in the pool that\u2019s honestly more disgusting than a lab in there", "\n..when are people going to learn that your kid is just as gross, if not *more* gross that a dog? YTA.", "I'd check the rules. There must be rules for it somewhere. \n\nAnd as they may vary from country to community  I think that is the only place to get a real answer if the dog is allowed. \n\nPersonally, I think young children *are* more likely to be unhygenic than a dog. But I also would feel weird if a dog was swimming next to me. But a dog alone or at a quiet spot? Nah. Let the poor animal cool off. \n\nSo, I wonder if there were there people swimming at the time the dog went in? \nAnd if so, what did *they* say about it?\n\nI can't tell if the ball went in on accident or on purpose, but either way, I think it's a bit tacky to chew someone out after they already told you sorry.\n\nand I don't think it was unprompted, as I suspect when you \n\n>thought it was gross and inconsiderate\n\nIt was written on your face... \n\nSo for me, YTA", "ESH. I am in agreement that dogs do not belong in public/community pools, but I definitely don\u2019t think the guy apologized completely unprompted. . . No doubt you were already staring him down with all your raging disapproval. To continue to berate him after he apologized is just tacky and over the top, IMO. Very \u201cyou kids get off my lawn!\u201d Of you.\n\n\nMostly I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t seen any other comments mention yet how much dog hair will end up clogging a pool filter if dogs are allowed to swim in it frequently. Not to mention all the dirt from their paws, especially in cases like the OP where it sounds like the owner is playing fetch with the dog in the pool, so repeatedly bringing more mud into the pool. Dog owner is definitely an AH here but OP did not need to escalate it. Only AH\u2019s do that.", "YTA", "NTA.\n\nAltho you didnt mention if dogs are allowed in the pool. However, if they are they should at least bathe their dog, groom him and clip his nails, dont let him get dirty again and then he can go in.\n\nThey also have to check if all chemicals in the water are dog safe too. IMO, if the chemicals can keep pool water clean from human activity, they are most likely able to keep it clean from washed dog activity. \n\nIf the dog is causing other disturbances however, such as if someone in the community is allergic to dog fur and wants to use the pool or if hes being too loud and too rowdy, he should be removed and not allowed back unless allergic person moves or his behaviour is corrected.", "I am assuming there is a condo board? Let them handle it. There are reasons most pools do not allow dogs. Maintenance fees would probably increase. Fur in the filter system. More dirt gathering on the bottom of the pool. There are lots of issues. \n\nI feel bad for the dog. Owners gets the dog used to swimming in the pool and then is told they can't anymore. Dog doesn't understand this and doesn't understand why it suddenly cannot get in the awesome pool anymore.", "NTA, except where you think your kiddos don\u2019t pee in the pool \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 drop the dye stuff in your pool and watch. I promise you they do!", "NTA. I\u2019m a dog person, but I can almost guarantee there are rules about this with the property management. Our neighborhood pool doesn\u2019t even allow dogs inside the gates for the pool. Our HOA threw a \u201cschool\u2019s out\u201d party this year and we had to make a lady take her puppy back home because she kept taking her inside the pool patio and wasn\u2019t watching her toddlers in the pool. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f She was mad because we \u201cmade her and her kids leave\u201d when the reality was that she had brought her toddlers in regular clothes (not swim attire, which is also in the rules), brought their puppy along and couldn\u2019t be both outside the fence with the puppy and watch her kids at the same time. When I told her she couldn\u2019t have the puppy inside the gates, she blew up at me and told me she would be filing a complaint right up until the point that several people pointed out all of her indiscretions plainly written on the rules board just inside the gates AND outside the gates. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "I don\u2019t think this is an aita situation\u2026either it\u2019s allowed or it\u2019s not. If it\u2019s allowed, then yelling at the guy is extremely rude. If it\u2019s not, then breaking the rules is extremely rude.", "Yep, an off-lease large breed dog in the pool area effectively prevents families with children from using the pool - it\u2019s just not safe. Not to mention the dirty dog paws, questionable anal hygiene (OK, not strictly limited to dogs), fleas, ticks, pesticide residue from topical flea/tick preventives, and other reasons you wouldn\u2019t necessarily want a dog in a community pool\u2026", "Dog and pool owner. Can confirm. My guys create much more dirt and fur in our pool than people do", "Yea the fur clogs up the filters I believe. This is why a lot of public pools have one \u201cdoggie day\u201d right before they drain it for the season but never before that", "So... technically, that would mean it all depends on how busy it was..", "My kids run out of the pool to pee - they hide in our garden or a private spot. I notice their friends do too (or use the bathroom inside) - i think the idea of swimming in someone\u2019s toilet water actually resonates with them. Dogs tho dgaf \ud83d\ude1c", "it's entitled to let your dog swim in a community pool when OP hasn't mentioned a rule against dogs being in the pool...?\n\ncranky people istg", "I actually believe they don't, and that a parent would know based on how long a kid spends in the pool without bathroom breaks.\n\nMy daughter refuses to pee anywhere but the bathroom. She's almost 4 and a real stickler for potty rules. I almost wish she'd just do it so we wouldn't have to hurry up, dry off, and run to the bathroom all the time.", "My dogs regularly try and sometimes succeed to roll in shit. Also people are supposed to shower before entering the pool and even if they don't they likely washed within the last week. Dogs are washed every few months if at all", "...you think kids pee every 10 minutes?\n\nI've known young kids (esp girl toddlers) to be bigger sticklers about using the bathroom than adults, maybe because they've been more recently potty trained", "Not only is it unhygienic, there is also a safety issue with off-leash dogs being in pools.", "Dogs are gross most of the time? They pee? They poop? Plenty of reason not to want dogs in cmunity pools. If you are okay with dogs in your own pool, fine, but not a pool you have to share with others", "Yeah no lmfao. Dogs are gross most of the time.", "What ? Most people love to pee in pool", "Never, because you pulled that out of your own ass.", "totally not a rocket scientist either", "Dogs roll around in and eat poop. Kids get a bath every day. There\u2019s no hygiene comparison.", "OP is a fool thinking their kids don\u2019t pee in the pool. I was a swim instructor for over a decade and most kids and adults pee in the pool. For those saying they don\u2019t pee in the pool, in my head are liars.", "And allergies", "Dog hair. I believe labs do shed so a lot of dog hair in that pool", "Exactly this. My two golden retrievers regularly swim in my pool. They get in more than I do. And I get **a lot** more dirt on the bottom now. Ugh.", "A community pool that allows dogs would be rare as fuck.", "what dog is going to poop or pee in a pool...? you clearly don't understand how dogs work", "You do not want to know how many parents will see the swimming as their kid's shower. ;)\n\nAlso, 'young kids' could be swimming diaper age.. \n\nAt the very least you'd have to trust their parents. \n\nBut, that's why I said 'personally', as I'll also swim in natural water. Can't control who's swimming there, so I'm not too bothered in a pool\n\nThere must be some rules in plave for that communal pool?"]}
