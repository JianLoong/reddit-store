I don't need anyone reminding me that in 1st grade I wrote a story about how I was going to marry a certain boy in my class. Even if I'd ended up with him I wouldn't want anyone reminding me of how geeked out I was over him simply existing.", "Feelings that arent reasonable or rational should be felt, understood and then let go.
