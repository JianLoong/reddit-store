Your brother in law shouldn't have kept it going. Everyone here is grown, and their behavior is juvenile.", "ESH this is unnecessary drama.", "ESH. Your BIL is a jerk and wouldn't stop. Your husband started a fight. You're blaming your sister for the actions of two adult men. It could have gone no further than her embarrassing you. Men acting badly is not a natural disaster like a tornado, where it's tragic and nobody is to blame. They're to blame. They're adults with free will. The only fault she has is bringing it up. Whatever happened afterwards is the fault your BIL and your husband. And you're at fault for blaming her for the actions of two dudes.", "Sounds like sis and bil are jealous that you and your husband adore each other. \n\nIf bil brings it up again, just tell him, \"Don't worry, I'm sure your next wife will love you the way my husband and I love each other\". \n\nSometimes, we need to be T A in response to A H behaviour.", "ESH between you, and your sister's husband.\n\nObviously, your BIL is an AH for continuously bringing it up once you was told to stop. Even if it wasn't an embarrassing story and he was just talking about some dog he saw yesterday.\n\nYou're the AH for blaming your sister for her husband's actions. You should be upset at him.\n\nI agree it's a cute story. I think instead of feeling embarrassed about it, you should work on owning it and thinking of it as a cute part of your history.", "ESH.  It IS a cute story and you should be proud of it.  Your BIL is the one who is the AH.   He just needs to shut up.", "What's so embarrassing about having a huge crush when you were younger? Pretty much everyone has gone through that and hey, you ended up marrying the person, which most people can't say. It's not funny for BIL if you don't bite, so probably that's your best strategy.\n\nThat being said, BIL is a bit of an asshole for poking all the time after you expressed you don't like it and asked him to stop. I don't think you can blame your sister for this since she only brought it up once - this is between you and BIL.\n\nMaybe take a step back and think about how ridiculous it is that 4 people within your family are arguing about something so silly.", "Soft YTA\n\nBrother in law is an idiot who needs to know when to stop, but that's really not your sister's fault. It's a very cute story, frankly, and I wouldn't blame her for bringing it up when someone else went too far with it caused the real problem.", "So is this an actual marriage, or a make-believe playground marriage? Because it sounds like an elementary school problem.", "NTA. You asked someone to stop doing something that bothered you and they didn't. That's all that is important here. Some posters seem to think the OP should get a thicker skin, but what it is the BIL is saying is irrelevant, it's the effect it is having that matters.", "YTA but only bc it\u2019s not your sisters fault, it\u2019s the BILs, bringing up a cute story about her remembering you being obsessed with your husband was fine, and shifting the blame to her instead of the in laws was an AH move tbh. What\u2019s wrong with loving your husband anyway? I don\u2019t understand why you got so upset, it could have been laughed off between you guys and everything would have been fine.", "NTA. But for the record, it's your husband's fault.", "ESH\n\nYou told your sister to drop it and she did but you're blaming her for your BIL running with it, he's a grown man and can own his own behaviour and blowing it up into a \"bad fight\" is overrating IMO, so your husband is in the wrong here too.", "So you say you were obsessed with your husband. Apparently he didn\u2019t mind as he married you. You shouldn\u2019t care what other people think.", "NTA.  Sis can't keep her mouth shut and is playing the victim.  BIL sounds like an ass.  Go LC for a while for your own mental health, and maybe they'll get the hint.", "NTA. Both your sister and BIL overpassed a boundary of yours and it was starting to become bullying.", "NTA, neither is your sister because she\u2019s right, it is cute. Your BIL however sounds like an annoying dick and needs to learn how to read the room\n\nEdit: really sounds like a jealousy thing on his part. It\u2019s abnormal to get hung up on something so trivial", "OP gets to feel however she feels. Her request is reasonable, and her sister and BIL are bullies.", "OP gets to feel however she wants. Her request is very reasonable. The two adults who won\u2019t stop talking about a subject she\u2019s clearly stated she doesn\u2019t like are the AH.", "I really don't see the issue with her sister bringing it up in the first place. It's literally just a story about how someone had a crush on their current husband, how the fuck would she guess that was a sore subject? Sister dropped it when asked, so she didn't do anything wrong.", "I think sis just honestly thinks it\u2019s a cute story but I totally agree about bil being jealous. It\u2019s just a weird reaction to keep teasing them about this.", "So now we're deciding what people should feel proud about? Weird.", "She must know her husband is an asshole so bare minimum it's ESH", "You can feel your feelings and still be rude. Her sister is an AH, but what is OP\u2019s deal that she needs to create this much friction over having had a crush on her husband. I\u2019m willing to bet that both sisters are the types of people that constantly have drama in their lives", "I disagree. She was sharing a cute story in company, and when she was asked to drop it she did. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to assume that after many years and marrying the crush that the OP would be over her embarrassment. And it's not her fault that her husband was inappropriate once learning that it was embarrassing.", "\"I've asked him multiple times to stop\"\n\nBIL us a dick\n\nNTA", "NTA!", "NTA. Your sister maybe jealous. You got a great guy while she got a dick.", "NTA. That BIL is an AH, in my experience the best way to get them to stop is to embarrass them with whatever they\u2019re annoying you with so throughly that they finally get the hint that their \u201cjoke\u201d is only fun to them.", "NTA, sounds like sis and BIL are alittle jealous can\u2019t help themselves but go after you through juvenile teasing. And then BIL for whatever reason kept going and pushing, your husband put a stop to it. It definitely is her fault for bringing it up and egging on BIL.", "NTA imagine clowning someone for being in love with their soulmate lol the only people who should be embarrassed is your BIL", "NTA - I hate it when people use the \"I'm just telling a cute story\" or \"It's what happened, what's the problem\" as some kind of out. I guarantee they are doing it in an antagonizing, annoying way to try to demean you and then they're acting like you are the one with the problem.\n\nThat being said, turn it around on them. You and your husband have an amazing relationship, so don't let you sister get the better of you. Someone else suggested saying \"I'm sorry that the passion in your marriage has died but you don't need to drag us down with you.\" And I think that's the perfect response. And just go live your life.", "ESH.  Why would you care? Why would they fight about it? This sounds stupid.", "NTA\n\nIn my family, we are responsible for our partners and their relationships with other family members. Your sister is absolutely responsible for her husband continuously bringing something up that you find uncomfortable after asking that they stop.\n\nWhether other people find it cute or not is irrelevant. *You* feel embarrassed when people bring it up. The moment someone knows that and continues to bring it up, they are purposely trying to embarrass you. And that's never OK in any circumstances.", "Nta you asked him multiple times to stop, he kept pressing it when he knew you didn\u2019t want to hear about it anymore. Your sister also knew how you felt about it so she should\u2019ve left well enough alone", "ESH\n\nYour sister should not have shared the information. She should have also told her husband to drop it. \n\nBIL should have dropped it when asked. \n\nHaving a crush on someone before you marry them is nothing to be embarassed about. \n\nYour husband could have handled it better", "INFO: you seem to be more hung up on the fact that your sister told about your crush and not about your BIL \"teasing\" you. Why? Did you confide in her and asked her to not tell anyone about your past? If so how long ago was it? Or are you upset that your sister let's her husband to approach the subject and doesn't say anything about it?", "I'm reminded of Andy and April on Parks and Rec where he teases his now wife, about how she had a crush on him\n\nIt's a cute and endearing moment\n\nJust crank up the lovey dovey until they get the point", "You can feel how you want to about it but I don't think it's reasonable to expect someone to never mention that you *like your spouse* (or that you also liked them in the past).\n\nShe could be more tactful about it since you've expressed this is embarrassing to you, but I wouldn't go so far as to say she did wrong.\n\nNAH", "nta, i get it, they are annoying but side note, don't be embarrassed for being \"obsessed\" with your husband. They are just jealous that they lack passion in their relationship. Next time they make fun of you, put it back on them. They won't know how to react.", "Much ado about nothing.  When they tease you about being obsessed, smile and say, \"Yes, I knew from the start that he was the one for me.\" \n\nBullies love to upset you. Their satisfaction comes from your reaction. Take away their power and don't show that they are getting to you.", "ESH except your sister.\n\nIt's normal for siblings to poke fun at each other, especially for trivial things like that.\n\nIt seems like you, your husband and your BIL are having a really hard time handling something pretty damn simple.", "NTA. And I struggle to understand why people here don't understand that it's embarrassing and infantalising to keep bringing it up to OP.", "How old are yall? All of you sound stupid to be honest.", "NTA. They sound like bitter jealous people.", "I am absolutely obsessed over my husband even 31 years latter and I had the biggest crush on him then. I'm not ashamed to admit. And it's a part of growing up.  \nYou need to just accept it. \nYour sister is just jealous that you found your happiness. \n\nNTA in this situation.", "NTA but there's nothing wrong with being obsessed with your spouse they clearly like you back. I used to like my husband's Instagram photos at 3 A.M. after we were married and I went back to school I'd write Mrs his last name of my notes and send him pictures. I am obsessed with that man.", "I don\u2019t think they are saying obsessed in the madly in love type. More like young teenager obsessed not dating type.", "I really don't see the issue with her sister bringing it up in the first place.", "THIS!\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f", "This is it right here. What they think doesn't matter, OP has asked them not to discuss it and that's a very small request. The fact that they refuse to stop after being asked repeatedly turns it into bullying. At this point the only reason to say anything is because they want the reaction they know they're going to get.", "Yeah, BIL sensed how embarrassed OP is and decided to exploit it. If she had embraced and joked about her and her husband's cute past instead of being ashamed he wouldn't be able to use it as something to make fun of.", "Does not matter what you think of her story. It is her story to tell. WTF!", "JFC it's her story. If she doesn't think it's cute then they need to STFU.", "Doesn't matter if anyone think it is a cute story. She doesn't need to do anything and it is her story to tell. Hilarious how everyone is telling her how she should feel.", "it is her sister's fault. She should have stopped telling the story a long time ago.", "Nope. They were told to drop it. They were told more than once to drop it. Nothing else matters.", "I'm sure the sister does think it's cute but also agree that she needs to stop. OP asked her to stop and she has nothing to gain by continuing to bring up something OP finds embarrassing unless she's TRYING to make OP feel bad. There's a bunch of things kids do that older family members find cute but the kid comes to find embarrassing and would like to not discuss.", "Agreed, that type of crush is always embarrassing in retrospect. I don't need anyone reminding me that in 1st grade I wrote a story about how I was going to marry a certain boy in my class. Even if I'd ended up with him I wouldn't want anyone reminding me of how geeked out I was over him simply existing.", "Feelings that arent reasonable or rational should be felt, understood and then let go. Asking people around you to cater to irrational feelings is controlling and manipulative. People need to be free to be themselves as well", "Because she finds it embarrassing, it's right there in the post.", "No she did not. She has continued to recite the story. It is not her story to tell. It does not matter if everyone else thinks it is cute.", "The BIL in the story wasn't even her husband, it's OP's husband's brother.", "Why? They think its cute. It isnt insulting whatsoever. Its perfectly fair game.", "On what effin drugs are you? Sister mentioned it once. There is no indication in the post that she went around and kept talking about it.", "She already knew her mom didn't want her cause mom had made it obvious.", "Asking people around you to not bring up something you find embarrassing isn't manipulative, you armchair psychologist.", "Where does it say that sister \"continued to recite\" story? Oh wait, nowhere.", "It quite literally says that she dropped it when told.", "Maybe. But girls with crushes sometimes do mortifyingly humiliating things. So, I'm not 100% on everyone else, but BIL is definitely an asshole.", "She told her to STFU and she didn't. Nothing else matters.", "Bot you aren't even on the right post", "She isn't putting a stop to her husband's behavior though. If my partner was teasing my sister and upsetting her I'd say something right then and there. And my sister and I aren't even close.", "Fair\n\nI wasnt expecting \"mortifyingly humiliating\" as opposed to something way more socially and legally acceptable. But you right. It could be real bad and not just a normal \"crush\" story."]}
