Your brother in law shouldn't have kept it going. Everyone here is grown, and their behavior is juvenile.", "ESH this is unnecessary drama.", "ESH. Your BIL is a jerk and wouldn't stop. Your husband started a fight. You're blaming your sister for the actions of two adult men. It could have gone no further than her embarrassing you. Men acting badly is not a natural disaster like a tornado, where it's tragic and nobody is to blame. They're to blame. They're adults with free will. The only fault she has is bringing it up. Whatever happened afterwards is the fault your BIL and your husband. And you're at fault for blaming her for the actions of two dudes.", "Sounds like sis and bil are jealous that you and your husband adore each other. \n\nIf bil brings it up again, just tell him, \"Don't worry, I'm sure your next wife will love you the way my husband and I love each other\". \n\nSometimes, we need to be T A in response to A H behaviour.", "ESH between you, and your sister's husband.\n\nObviously, your BIL is an AH for continuously bringing it up once you was told to stop. Even if it wasn't an embarrassing story and he was just talking about some dog he saw yesterday.\n\nYou're the AH for blaming your sister for her husband's actions. You should be upset at him.\n\nI agree it's a cute story. I think instead of feeling embarrassed about it, you should work on owning it and thinking of it as a cute part of your history.", "ESH.  It IS a cute story and you should be proud of it.  Your BIL is the one who is the AH.   He just needs to shut up.", "What's so embarrassing about having a huge crush when you were younger? Pretty much everyone has gone through that and hey, you ended up marrying the person, which most people can't say. It's not funny for BIL if you don't bite, so probably that's your best strategy.\n\nThat being said, BIL is a bit of an asshole for poking all the time after you expressed you don't like it and asked him to stop. I don't think you can blame your sister for this since she only brought it up once - this is between you and BIL.\n\nMaybe take a step back and think about how ridiculous it is that 4 people within your family are arguing about something so silly.", "Soft YTA\n\nBrother in law is an idiot who needs to know when to stop, but that's really not your sister's fault. It's a very cute story, frankly, and I wouldn't blame her for bringing it up when someone else went too far with it caused the real problem.", "So is this an actual marriage, or a make-believe playground marriage? Because it sounds like an elementary school problem.", "NTA. You asked someone to stop doing something that bothered you and they didn't. That's all that is important here. Some posters seem to think the OP should get a thicker skin, but what it is the BIL is saying is irrelevant, it's the effect it is having that matters.", "YTA but only bc it\u2019s not your sisters fault, it\u2019s the BILs, bringing up a cute story about her remembering you being obsessed with your husband was fine, and shifting the blame to her instead of the in laws was an AH move tbh. What\u2019s wrong with loving your husband anyway? I don\u2019t understand why you got so upset, it could have been laughed off between you guys and everything would have been fine.", "NTA. But for the record, it's your husband's fault.", "ESH\n\nYou told your sister to drop it and she did but you're blaming her for your BIL running with it, he's a grown man and can own his own behaviour and blowing it up into a \"bad fight\" is overrating IMO, so your husband is in the wrong here too.", "So you say you were obsessed with your husband. Apparently he didn\u2019t mind as he married you. You shouldn\u2019t care what other people think.", "NTA.  Sis can't keep her mouth shut and is playing the victim.  BIL sounds like an ass.  Go LC for a while for your own mental health, and maybe they'll get the hint.", "NTA. Both your sister and BIL overpassed a boundary of yours and it was starting to become bullying.", "NTA, neither is your sister because she\u2019s right, it is cute. Your BIL however sounds like an annoying dick and needs to learn how to read the room\n\nEdit: really sounds like a jealousy thing on his part. It\u2019s abnormal to get hung up on something so trivial", "OP gets to feel however she feels. Her request is reasonable, and her sister and BIL are bullies.", "OP gets to feel however she wants. Her request is very reasonable. The two adults who won\u2019t stop talking about a subject she\u2019s clearly stated she doesn\u2019t like are the AH.", "I really don't see the issue with her sister bringing it up in the first place. It's literally just a story about how someone had a crush on their current husband, how the fuck would she guess that was a sore subject? Sister dropped it when asked, so she didn't do anything wrong.", "I think sis just honestly thinks it\u2019s a cute story but I totally agree about bil being jealous. It\u2019s just a weird reaction to keep teasing them about this.", "So now we're deciding what people should feel proud about? Weird.", "She must know her husband is an asshole so bare minimum it's ESH", "You can feel your feelings and still be rude. Her sister is an AH, but what is OP\u2019s deal that she needs to create this much friction over having had a crush on her husband. I\u2019m willing to bet that both sisters are the types of people that constantly have drama in their lives", "I disagree. She was sharing a cute story in company, and when she was asked to drop it she did. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to assume that after many years and marrying the crush that the OP would be over her embarrassment. And it's not her fault that her husband was inappropriate once learning that it was embarrassing."]}
