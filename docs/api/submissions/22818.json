However my older sibling did not appreciate the fact that our father had promised our uncle that we would attend without asking us first. Couple that with the fact that he had already established plans to hang out with his girlfriend that day, there was no convincing him of going. I did not want to go alone, and we both decided to text our uncle that we really appreciated the invite however we unfortunately would not be able to attend this year as we had a \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d. \n\na few days later, I called my father like normal and I could automatically tell by the tone In his voice that he was annoyed. After he hung up on me In the middle of our conversation. I immediately texted my younger sibling, who lived with him at the time, and asked, \u201che\u2019s upset with me isn\u2019t he?\u201d My sibling then told me that my father said that he would not talk to us. \n\nFor the next year my father would not speak with me nor my older sibling. No calls. No texts. Nothing. I tried to reach out to him on his birthday to wish him a happy birthday. However he ignored my call and left my text message on seen. \n\nDuring this period of no contact, my parents were going through a divorce which only added to the turbulence. \n\nI tried to reach out to him one more time, even though everyone around me urged me not to. My younger sibling told me that my father said that he \u201cloved me\u201d and to \u201chave a good life\u201d. After that I was completely checked out and had given up trying to rekindle a relationship with him.\n\n6 months later my father called me and said that he wanted to establish a relationship again. While I am cordial with him, I do not text and call him nearly as much as I had use to. And truthfully, I do not know if I want to try and rekindle the relationship. My biggest concern is that what if I do something slightly inconvenient to him and he ostracizes me again? He has said a lot of things that can not be taken back.

So my dad doesn't go I still get married and a few weeks later moved out of state. Didn't take my dad a year to talk to me again just 4 or 5 months later.

I got fed up with it, warned him about it and he did it again. I cut him off at that point.\n\nThis is your dad's way of handling things. He won't change unless he wants to change.

Was your uncle mad you didn't go?  Why is it such a big deal to your father? Why the big deal?", "You are not refusing to talk to your father because of Thanksgiving.  Your father, in fact, cut you off for more than a year because you didn't go to your uncle's house for Thanksgiving, You tried to reach out, but he didn't care.  And then he said some horrible things to you.  This sounds like the reason your feelings toward him have changed -- because of his bad behavior, and because given that behavior, you don't trust him.\n\nIf your father wants your trust and a relationship with you at this point, he needs to earn them.\n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty about.\n\nNTA", "Why?"]}
