For the record, he isn't autistic and does not technically have a speech delay.\n\nSide note: she has another friend that has helped her during times we weren't speaking, fully due to her own behavior and past abusive outbursts towards me, and she has informed me she'll be naming the baby after her.

Why would I do that? wouldn't it be \"unfair\" to my own child? and my husband who actually works full-time plus overtime and on-call?\n\nToday was the topper. I offered to mail her very expensive baby items, and was insulted with \"well, I don't know because you have cats and I don't think I could handle the hair\"\n\nOkay.\n\nSo now I'm just wondering why I'm even involved to begin with, and if I should return the new clothes I bought for the baby. \n\nAm I the assole for wanting to give up?", "created_utc": 1675623705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ukdih/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_best_friend_with_baby/", "score": 277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is now having a boy around my bday and i am going to spend a few days with her when my nephew is born. She did not expect this. I gave her no choice and she is thrilled. I know how hard this will be but she does not sound like a good friend at all. She expects you to do what she couldnt. I say couldnt because maybe she didnt feel comfortable taking the money offered when they couldnt pay and would feel like they owe you. She makes fun of your son which is unacceptable. My son had a speech delay and at 3 he was non verbal. You wouldnt know it hearing him now because of the effert i put in. One of my daughters, docs kept threatening to hospitalize her because she is so petite. Opposite i know, but family still tries to push how much calories she gets even though her height and weight match on growth charts. She is just small for her age.

They dont all sound a certain way. You also got her very nice cloths for the baby and she says forget it because she cant handle cat hair? I get people have allergies but come on?

The thing is, you can\u2019t have a real relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t care about your children but fully expects you to care about theirs. \n\nI had a very close friend from college. Once I got pregnant things changes a little. After i had my kids, she would only ask very surface things about how the kids are doing, but it was \ud83d\udcafclear she didn\u2019t actually have any interest in them. So I limited how much I talked about the kids and we continued to be friends, though my emotional connection to her wasn\u2019t what it once was. \n\nFast forward a few years, during which I\u2019d watched as my friend\u2019s siblings had kids and she became completely obsessed with them, flying across the country monthly to see them, sent me pics of them, updated me constantly about them, but still couldn\u2019t abide more than a few minutes of me talking about my own kids\u2014much less even trying to get to know my kids who lived 5 minutes from her. One day she says she\u2019s ready to be a mom so she\u2019s going to do artificial insemination with donor sperm. I\u2019m totally supportive of this in general. But as the weeks passed, it became extremely apparent that she expected me to be her cheerleader and get all excited about the baby. But I couldn\u2019t. I just felt more and more resentful with each call and text. Because she CHOSE to treat my kids like they didn\u2019t matter. It wasn\u2019t circumstances that kept her from knowing them. It was a CHOICE. I couldn\u2019t choose to be her baby\u2019s \u201cauntie\u201d when she her choice was to be a stranger to my children.  I couldn\u2019t pretend that was ok for one more second.
