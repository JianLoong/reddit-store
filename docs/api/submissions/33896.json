You read that right. \n\nMy husband (40m) has a bad habit of snacking in bed every night. I'm not talking one cookie, it\u2019s a multi course dessert extravaganza. EVERY NIGHT.

It\u2019s a clear takeout container with a piece of banana bread covered in mold and I immediately realize that this is the same banana bread that he brought home 2/3 weeks ago. Disgusted, I shot him a text that said, \u201cYou know you have a container with mold covered banana bread next to the bed, right?\u201d  He replied that he did not and that he would toss it when he gets home. \n\nFast forward to a few minutes ago where I go into the bedroom to settle in for the night. The banana bread is still there, so I mentioned it once again. He angrily said I should have thrown it out when I saw it. My take is, it\u2019s not my disgusting mess and he is a 40 year old man - not my child. This is not the first time there\u2019s been a mess due to his nighttime eating.

There is absolutely no way I could go to bed with someone who wants dead food in the bedroom. I like the suggestion of separate bedrooms. Take a snow shovel to move all of his stuff into the guest room.", "NTA\n\nHe is blaming you for his shortcomings.\n\nConsider:\n- marriage counseling \n- personal counseling \n- write out everyone\u2019s household contributions so you can have a civil conversation about division of labor (include mental work load too like meal planning and finances, etc)\n- moving into separate rooms completely (like everything so that he can 100% be a slob in his room and you never need to go in there)\n- divorce (hopefully this is the last resort after other less nuclear options are exhausted)", "Nta I'm a bit of a slob myself, but even I don't eat in the bedroom or leave moldy food around. Your husband is gross.", "Take a shovel to his side of the room and throw out anything you scoop up. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Would moving the TV into the guest room solve the snacking-in-your-bed problem? \n\nSomething has to change in this situation, but it shouldn't be you cleaning up his mess.", "Have you considered separate bedrooms? That way he can eat in bed, watch the TV and collect old and moldy food to his heart's content, while you can sleep in a crumb free bed, with no TV, and no old and moldy food.\n\nYou're NTA for refusing to clean up after him, but if you're not going to do it, you can't force him to do it after he's got into bed.", "NTA. I'd pick it up and put it on his nightstand, so that it's right in his face when he wakes up. Now if he \"forgets\" to toss it when he has to look at it.......", "ESH\n\nYes, he should be cleaning up after himself. \n\nWith that being said, you are intentionally being petty and causing drama when you could have easily thrown it out, because you are trying to make it a point that you want him to throw out his disgusting food. Isn't it easier for you to just throw it out than to blow things up?", "Yes. I\u2019ll take two pats please. \n\nHonestly, I wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t losing my mind on this. The sureness he had in calling me an asshole in this situation had me second guess myself.", "Yes on the car but maybe hide it inside the car somewhere.\n\nNTA", "Yes, however I am certain I would be forced to take the guest room if I suggested that and the primary would become a disaster zone I\u2019d have to navigate through to get to my closet, bathroom, and belongings.", "i think this is \"separate house\" territory not separate bedrooms (not just because of the food, because of the attitude he's giving OP about it)", "No. Because then it becomes the expectation that she will clean up after his messes. She is not his maid. He needs to clean up after himself.", "You do realise this is exactly how women end up doing 90% of the housework, right? This is the worst advice ever.", "Is he like\u2026 a good person or partner outside of this? I\u2019d find it hard to believe tbh but what\u2019s your take?", "You would need to fully move out of that bedroom, and potentially out of that bathroom.\n\nSomething needs to change. Moving bedrooms is one option. Talking to him, again, about how his choices affect you is another. You're the one who needs something to change, so you're the one who has to change the situation. There's no pretzel you can tie yourself in that means he'll start tidying up the bed and bedside every morning without you saying anything. So you need to talk to him and get him on board with tidying up after himself, or you need to change your situation so his slothful habits don't harm you", "I don't disagree, but OP needs to come to that realisation themself", "This. \n\nIf she cleans the mess he makes, he won\u2019t do it.", "If she's not cleaning up after him, the mature approach is to establish this rule and communicate it ahead of time. Then, no more cleaning up after establishing this rule and she would be NTA.\n\nInstead, she chose to do it in a way to intentionally start a fight to prove a point.", "yeah that's true. just putting it out there that the food thing isn't the only problem, bc it's not right to be treated like that. \n\nSometimes people need to see others going \"wtf??\" to realise shit ain't right.", "This \"rule\" doesn't need to be established. No grown adult thinks it's ok to leave mouldy food around for someone else to clean up after them.\n\nThis is why my 27yo daughter doesn't want to date. Even at her young age she has no interest in training men how to adult.", "I\u2019ve already communicated in the past that he cannot leave food in the bedroom reasoning that it can attract bugs, that we have pets who could choke on a wrapper/eat something toxic, and that it\u2019s just plain gross. Add in that I communicated to him about it being there this morning and he agreed to toss it. \n\nI\u2019m sure if I continue asking nicely I\u2019ll be upgraded to the \u201cnagging asshole\u201d. Do I keep asking until I\u2019m blue in the face?", "What you say here is her acting as his mom. As a mom, I absolutely do that with my kids - communicate a boundary and help them enforce it. As a grown adult, I understand that food cannot be left on the floor to rot. The husband here is a grown adult. \n\nWomen are not the only adults in a relationship. We will not communicate and set clear boundaries around basic hygiene with our partners, because that is the base level expectation.", "I agree, this shouldn't be something that needs to be established. But \"should\" and \"is\" are two different things. In this situation, it clearly is.\n\nHis behavior is a lack of respect for her if she has communicated how much it bothers her, and that is really the worst part. But if her behavior were improving the situation, the original post wouldn't exist. She is escalating, not improving the situation.\n\nYou accept the situation for what it is, work out the situation, or leave the situation. Based on what OP has posted, she does not accept the situation. Her approach is not helping in working out the situation. She has the right to have her policies and leave if if her husband can't do it. If he doesn't respect her enough to maintain a level of cleanliness like a reasonable person, I highly doubt this is the only problem in the relationship.", "He's absolutely ridiculous, but you're not helping the situation. This post exists because the situation got worse after what you did. If your behavior improved the situation, this post wouldn't exist. Do you see my point here?\n\nIf you're posting this for validation to justify your behavior, getting such validation will not fix your relationship. What will fix your relationship is establishing what is unacceptable and getting on the same page.\n\nSo leave him if he doesn't respect you enough to change his behavior. And it goes without saying that you should communicate with him that his behavior is unacceptable to the point that warrants you leaving him if he won't get his act together.", "This is exactly like a wife needing to make a list of ways to clean the house for a husband to do it. THAT IS INSANE. A grown adult can see the garbage on the floor and know that it should not be there. A grown adult can see dishes in the sink and know they need to be washed. \n\nMen need to do the base level of reasonable housework - like not leaving moldy food on the floor - WITHOUT BEING ASKED because their wives are not their mothers and are not teaching them how to adult.", "He is immature, and his behavior is not acceptable. Her behavior is not the solution to the problem. Do you really think her approach will get her what she wants without additional damage to the relationship?\n\nShe has the choice to handle the situation like a mature person or stoop down to his level.\n\nThere's almost no chance this is the only problem in the relationship. If something like one partner leaving disgusting food around will ruin a relationship, there were probably bigger things wrong with the relationship", "Her approach is to remind him there is rotting food on the floor that is his responsibility. That's not immature. That's the truth.  \n\nHis reaction is immature. \n\nSomething she could have done that was immature would be to place the rotting food on his pillow. Or in his face while sleeping. \n\nSimply pointing out the problem and his culpability in it IS NOT IMMATURE. \n\nyou need a higher bar.", "I could never be with somebody who doesn't pick up after themselves or who brings food into the bedroom. There's a reason for kitchens and dining-rooms. These are two disgusting habits: being messy and snacking in bed.", "NTA.  He presumably doesn't pull his weight with the housework either, unless he's vacuumed up the floor around the mouldy food?!", "nta  \nget a second room or move to the guest room and leave it on his pillow", "Nta. If you give in now you will for the rest of your life.", "your lungs will hate you if that container is opened in the house. Just throw the whole thing away. y w b t a for endangering your health. NTA for refusing to clean up properly.", "It would be if this was a single event but it\u2019s a recurring issue and she shouldn\u2019t be expected to clean up after him everytime. Hell, she shouldn\u2019t have to remind him about his mess", "How overweight is he?", "A duplex!!! All married couples should own a duplex!!! Especially for issues like these.\n\nEdit to add /s for those that didn\u2019t get it", "But she already did the first part you just stated. \n\nThis comment is unhinged.", "that would be prohibitively expensive for many couples, I think, and won't fix the disrespect \n\n(when i say separate house i don't mean the relationship should continue while they're in separate houses)", "Edited my comment to add /s\u2026it was a joke of kinds", "\ud83d\ude02 the multiple exclamation marks should have given it away, but there are some real out of touch dummies out there who would say this kind of thing sincerely."]}
