Dad met Shantell 6 years ago and they got married 2 years ago. Her son is 10. My brother and I have known Shantell and her son for almost 4 years now but not 4 years yet. Shantell's son Kyle is an only child, has no dad, no extended family, and he latched onto me fiercely when we met. It was frustrating how he'd insert himself into stuff with my brother. He'd invite himself along. He would try to touch me and hold onto me and my dad and Shantell told me to allow it and hug him when I'd tell them it made me uncomfortable and annoyed me. Eventually I started to stop him and tell him not to touch me and not to cling to me.\n\nDad and Shantell realized the three of us hadn't bonded the way they wanted us to, for Kyle, so they insisted on leaving me with both him and my brother and having me babysit them while they left the house. This was during the day and night. Dad would also set up times where I had to take them to the park.\n\nSo I should bring up my brother and I are close, like super close. We lost our mom, all four grandparents and our only uncle (we have aunts) in the space of like 3 years. Losing them made us closer. I was always an affectionate big brother (my mom used to say that) and our relationship is so easy and natural that we hug, or I'll ruffle his hair or he'll sit on me sometimes if he wants something. None of it is forced and it just kind of happens.\n\nKyle saw a lot of that during the forced babysitting, the forced park trips, etc. And he never got to hang all over me or be my shadow like he wanted and I'm not affectionate with him and it's caused him to have trouble dealing with stuff. Shantell was concerned and so he went to therapy for that. He admitted to being jealous and that he hates my brother. But he also wants me all to himself. He's still in therapy but he told Shantell that he's never going to be happy not being my brother.\n\nShantell and dad blamed it all on me. They said I had a responsibility to Kyle to be a good brother to him and that it was my job as the oldest to look out for him and make sure I was loving him the same as I love my brother. My dad has brought it up a couple of times on his own as well and the last time I told him that he and Shantell should look at themselves, because they knew Kyle was seriously clingy with me and they sent him out with me and my brother knowing we're close and have an affectionate relationship and did nothing to make sure he'd be okay. He told me I should have put my own feelings aside and done what Kyle needed me to do. Shantell was like how dare I blame them and she called me evil for blaming them when I have destroyed her son.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678101074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jvy5g/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_and_his_wife_need_to/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kyle should have been told that the two of you are brothers, plus you've both suffered the same serious losses in a very short time. That means the two of you have a special bond. Kyle needs to be taught his bond with you will be different because of that. And he cannot force it, otherwise, that will only drive you further away.\n\nAnd no one should ever be forced to accept affection and clinginess from someone if it makes them uncomfortable. You have the right to pick and choose who's allowed to touch you.\n\nI worry about you, to be blunt. In a few years, you're going to be able to live on your own. And you're going to want to have contact with your brother.

Just watch out for your brother and the kid does sound like someone who may do something to your brother. Its just my gut feeling speaking and thought of mentioning it. \n\nIf you don't feel like it, refuse the forced baby sitting and tell your dad to find someone else for the kid to play with.

Family therapy might even be the way to go here as well, since your parents are trying to force emotions instead of foster them. Kyle clearly is trying to fill a void in his life and I feel sorry for him, but you can\u2019t be forced to fill it. Blending families is hard, but it\u2019s not your responsibility as one of the children to make the dynamic work by forcing a relationship that isn\u2019t there with Kyle.

So now he still doesn't have the big brother he has always dreamed of because you've decided you don't want to fill that role for him. Once again, thats your choice and you are entitled to make it, but throw the poor kid a bone every now and then.

(You should offer to go talk to that therapist and fill him/her in on your side of the situation.) But unless you are actively being mean to Kyle, and I don't think it sounds like you are, none of that is your fault.

Step family relations are never easy and can't be forced. That's exactly what your dad and Shantell tried to do, from the start.

That is very rarely going to work.\n\nThey should have taken things gently, realised Kyle was attached but you were struggling, and supported you with that. Throwing you all together on your own was NOT the right approach. \n\nTheir parenting skills during this have been dodgy, to say the least.

Do you have any trusted teachers or friends parents you can talk to about this? It isn\u2019t fair for them to force you into this. Kyle will never be your full blooded sibling who has been through hell and back with you. Only you and your brother understand what you went through.

He\u2019s in therapy for a reason and it\u2019s hard for me to believe a relationship with you is the core reason. You\u2019re young and blaming you is unfair. Shantell is evil for calling you evil. No one should be allowed to touch you unless it\u2019s with your consent. Would Shantell appreciate you telling her to let someone touch her, I think not. Her son is her responsibility, bottom line. She can\u2019t make you feel anything other than what you do. Hopefully she is in therapy also. As far as your father he needs to get his head out of his ass and come up with better solutions.

He is a little kid. And in his eyes you ARE his brother and, hoping your parents will stay together, he is here to stay for the long ride. \nHaving a good and healthy relationship with him is a benefit to him, but also for you!\nIt\u2019s not your parents fault if they have push for it, you all still leave under the same roof, any parents will have promote it. \nAnd you do have some responsibility on him. It\u2019s quite normal for parents of multiple children to ask each of them to step into house duties accordingly to age and maturity. Mostly for older one is asked to supervise the youngest. If then your parents exploit this, I don\u2019t know. But into a certain degree it\u2019s normal. \nWhile you can\u2019t be forced to love him, you also can\u2019t force him to unlove you. Be grateful he does as it\u2019s easier to be on the detached (loved) side of the stick then the attached (unloved) side. It\u2019s wrong from your parents to pretend you love him as much as your brother, but you also seem like to want to esclude him, from your post seems almost like you resent him for his love.

You don't have to be Kyle's brother if the feelings aren't there. But I think one important thing as we grow up and become more mature is to recognize that love and kindness aren't something where you only have a limited amount to give. You can still be really close to your brother and have a special bond with him you don't share with anyone else and also be kind to Kyle. I'm sure you've heard of the organization Big Brothers Big Sisters where they match older role models with younger people in need of someone to be a positive influence in their life.

You simply cannot be a parent or a counselor for this kid.\n\nI suggest that when your dad and his wife try to pressure you, casually bring up Child Protective Services. \"Hey dad and Shantell, I can see how frustrated we all are about Kyle's behavior. The fact is, *as a minor under 18 years old myself*, I simply have no idea how to be the parent/role model for a dusturbed kid like Kyle who obviously needs to see a professional mental health therapist who is qualified to help Kyle deal with whatever his issues are.

It was there from the very first time we saw each other and it's intense and not in a good way. My dad and Shantell just decided that we would suddenly start staying home, change the schedule, so I would babysit. That was not something they did naturally. It was intended to force bonding. But it was never going to work. Same thing with the park. I wasn't offering to take my brother. I was told I was taking him and Kyle whether I had planned to take anyone or not.\n\nI have reached the point where I dislike all interactions with him and if I could choose would stay out of his way. The truth is I don't see that changing either when my dad refuses to help and expects me to suck it up and love him and be his brother. In two years they are only going to screw it up more because I will have moved out and if Kyle still has this OTT attachment to me he's going to be crushed when I'm not around anymore.

I have myself three and the youngest one is often single out cause he needs more supervision and \u2018he is boring\u2019 (my oldest words) cause of corse he can\u2019t do things like his older siblings. well tough shit you live under the same roof, we are a family. I do understand individual bonds are different and cont force equality, but sometime, as we live in families, society, multi personal environments, a degree of compromise is due.", "Well quite pretentious of you to say what Kyle loves and what not. I can imagine a 6 year old (age they met) it\u2019s not adult love but yeah kids latches like bugs that\u2019s what they do. On their siblings butts, mommies, caregivers. Considering he never had a family I can imagine double so. Again I m not seeing any ass here. This is why I put NAH I see a 16 years old dropped in a family he didn\u2019t want, in a role he didn\u2019t want, two parents trying to make everything get along which usually what biological or step parents have to do, and a little kid wanted to be part of that siblings bonding time and wanted to be loved.", ">boundaries.\n\n\nPlease. It's a lonely but affectionate 10 year old trying to bond. It's not someone walking in on you when you're in the shower, borrowing your things without asking, or listening in on private conversations. \n\nPut yourself in the little boy's shoes. Just for a moment. Imagine the immensity of his pain. \n\nOP should try having some empathy and some humanity, as should the majority of the commenters here.", "Read between the lines. The reality is that OP is rejecting the little boy because he doesn't want to accept him as part of the family and doesn't want to consider him a brother. \n\nIt would literally cause him no physical or psychological pain to let the kid cling to him. If he was a good person, that is.\n\nOP's behaviour is unfair, unkind, and uncharitable. All those descriptors make OP the AH here.", "Why is it an absurd take?\n\nThe child had no family aside from his mother. \n\nNow he does, but his attempts at bonding and joining in on the dynamic, no matter how awkwardly, were rejected by an older kid who should have tried to have some empathy. Not even \"more\" empathy. Just any. \n\nThe West is so individualistic and self absorbed they've forgotten the definition of selfish. \n\nThe older boy has been cruel to the little one.", "Just Kyle is in therapy. Not the rest of us.", "No, he does not have to be friends with Kyle is he does not want to. They are allowed to have that boundary. Just because they are now legally classed as \u201cfamily\u201d does not mean they are obligated to treat them as such.", "They are brothers, step brothers, so there was nothing wrong with your word choice.", "I am so sick of people blending families and telling their kids they have no say in the matter, then saying that they bear a responsibility to make the family blend well. Then we've got biological families making their oldest be unpaid babysitters and parentifying the hell out of them. \n\nI mean, you can go ahead and WANT to have everything your way. You can. You won't get it but you can keep barking up that tree, sure.", "You are expecting a 16 year old to be more mature than their parent. Fucking absurd you will ignore the real issue.", "So? That\u2019s not OP\u2019s burden to bear. That is entirely on OP\u2019s dad and Kyle\u2019s mother. Instead of trying to force OP into the relationship (which only causes resentment btw), they should instead get therapy for Kyle.", "The problem never have been about a hug. And an approach that his parents force OP to do is very selfish and hurtfull to the OP's stepbrother.\n\nYou saw this only from a perspective of one child (who, undeniably, pitifull and should be cared about), but there are 3 kids (yes, OP is also considered here as a kid), who had tragedies happend to them in the past and still dealing with that. \n\nThere is usually a case, that stepsiblings relationship doesn't magically become good and close out of nothing. Even if there are kids, there are independent human beings, who have their preferrence and opinion. You can't force them to feel \"sibling\" love on the spot. And thats exactly what OP's stepbrother needs, not a convinient lie, but a real feeling. Not some superstitional pretended brotherly love. To make him think that he and OP have it, which in reallity is not is very cruell to the kid.\n\nAnd the most horrible thing is what their parents tried to force to do the OP. Like \"Oh, we won't do a shit about this, but will force another kid to deal with this by sucking up and pretend to love and lie to other kid, instead being a parent, and help their children\".\n\nNTA", "No, the only one being cruel to anyone is the parents trying to force the relationship. Also that \u201cthe West\u201d nonsense reeks of racism. There is nothing to do with being \u201cselfish\u201d here. OP is not obligated to have a relationship with the kid.", "You are grossly using the term boundary. Isolating a family member (which he is) it\u2019s absolutely not an healthy one. Specially when we are talking about children in formation years (prepubescent). Also Kyle didn\u2019t asked to be dropped into this. The F I am sure biological parents do not send out voting ballots to their children if they want to have more kids. To have a respectful and equal in TREATMENT (not feelings those are personal) is a must in any social environment so much so in a family.", "So what \u2018dad don\u2019t get remarried?\u2019 \nMaking kids do staff for them? You are telling me you never had chores when you grow up you did whatever you want? Tell you want not even parents  or adult or children are free do what they want, at home, at work, at school or in any social settings. We share responsibilities, duties in accordance to our abilities. I stressed already that parents should not take advantage of it. But also it\u2019s quite expected in biological or blended families.", "No, I'm advising him to reframe and choose a more loving approach. \n\nBased on your acidic response, you ought to give this a try in your own life too.\n\nPS: you realise that 16 is considered a \"young adult,\" right? That being 16 means you should have a level of mental maturity, and should be striving towards becoming even more mentally mature? Why are you infantilising this young man?", "Nope. It's all about perspective, and OP as well as yourself are taking a very intolerant, self serving perspective. One that has caused clear division in OP's family. \n\nLiterally all OP had to do was be a bit more loving and accommodating. He'll regret his behaviour in time, when he's older and wiser and has kids of his own.", ">Also that \u201cthe West\u201d nonsense reeks of racism. \n\nFirst of all, you're using the incorrect term. Hint: It's not \"racism\" you're looking for.\n\nSecond of all, jokes on you. I'm multicultural, but American. I've lived in multiple places, and visited many many more. Just calling it how I see it and know it to be. Many studies back me up. So go ahead and rail all you like. It's simply factual that the West has a more individualistic culture when compared to the rest of the world. \n\n>OP is not obligated to have a relationship with the kid.\n\nWhether he likes it or not, OP and the child are family now. Therefore, in a sane, rational, and empathetic world he is obligated.\n\nBut it's fine, we can disagree. Or do you not know how to agree to disagree, either?", "As far as OP is concerned, no, Kyle is NOT a family member, as well as Kyle\u2019s mother. They are just their father\u2019s wife and her son. Bio parents SHOULD be making sure their children are happy to become a blended family, and not force them into being friendly with people that have been forced into their lives.", "Its that the parents are taking no responsibility, obviously. Thier blended family has issues and instead of taking the time to spend MORE time with their kids, they force the kids themselves together to figure it out. I dont believe you're this obviously obtuse that you don't see the problem here. Im sorry if you're coming from a defensive place because it really sounds like you are. Idk if you need to take a look at some of your own practices or what but coming from a blended and blended and reblended family, this is not the way. And now that I have a family of my own with just my husband and our two kids, yeah, id love to push some more responsibility onto my kids so I have less to do. I guess? Idk. I mostly ask for help and when I do we all work together. They're kids, yes, but they're people also. People that didn't ask to be here. I asked for them to be here. Im here to give them opportunity. Im not here breeding hands for help. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ok, its clear you don't get my point.\n\nHis stebrother(SB) wants a family love of a sibling from OP. \n\nOP couldn't give it to him due to psychological state, beacuse he and his brother lost many family members in timeline of 3 years. They are grieving.\n\nSB brother also dealing with his psycological staff, because of not having father in his life and wanting to have a family feeling woth his new family members (why OP's father couldn't take this role, I don't know).\n\nSo your and parents \"brilliant\" decision on how to solve this potentially traumatical for all 3 kids issue is TO LIE.\nOnce again the problem never was only about hugs or just playing together, it was about one side wanting from other side to have feelings which second one could do right now.\n\nSB wants real siblings relationship with OP, but OP mentally is not ready to closely connect with other people after loosing so many relatives in a span of 3 years. \n\nDo you really think that its fair to the OP and, especially to SB? \n10 y.o. is already a person, who already understand some things. What you will feel when you learn that your brother was just pretending to think of you as a family?\nNot to mention how much pressure and impact it will cause on the OP mental health to lie someone so vulnerable.\n\nOnce again the approach that you and OP's parent suggested is a potentially dangerous and could and with a big mess, which will make OP, SB and OP's little brother deal with their therapists for a very long time.", "No one is obligated to have a relationship with anyone, not even with bio family. \n\nI definitely agree that I disagree.", "Well guess what, even biological siblings are not a child choice. One of my kid asked to have her brother left at hospital the day he was born\u2026 immagine \n\u2018Sure honey whatever makes YOU happy, cause a family it\u2019s only about YOU and YOU alone.\u2019 \nChildren eventually, hopefully, leave home and make their own adult choices and life.\nAnd while a parent should always consider his children desires he can\u2019t also totally bend to their will. Is the step mother abusive? No. Are they inhuman, show illegal or even disrespectful, abusive behavior? No. So at one point people\u2026 compromise. \nOtherwise there is no end. Boundaries are there not to prevaricate in other socially acceptable choices.", "Kyle is a family member and he is his step brother. Those are the facts.", "They even went and ARE in therapy. Doesn\u2019t seems to me the position of parents that don\u2019t give a shit.\nIt may even be the suggestion of the therapist to leave them alone. Again I said \u2018not take advantage\u2019 but if you do something with one sibling the other tag along. And once in a while you can have 1 on 1 sibling time, majority? Together. You also have to consider the feelings of the other sibling, you can\u2019t expect to have yours respected and not have the same courtesy. Again I said compromise. He is 16, oh there are people requesting emancipation and moving out, if it\u2019s soooo horrible he can go that route. I really hope not.", "Yes, OP has lost many people in his life, and yes, that's terribly tragic. No one is arguing that. \n\nOP could choose to handle the pain of his loss by being standoffish and aloof. Cliquish. Rejecting new relationships and refusing to let others in. \n\nOr OP could take another perspective. \n\nHere is a little boy from a similar background coming into his life who from day one has shown nothing but love and admiration for him. He has an opportunity to gain one more person into his life, making it more meaningful, if he only chooses to accept the boy's love.\n\nMy opinion is that OP is TA for rejecting this little boy's attempts at affection. Whether he means to or not, he is punishing the boy for trying to love him and his brother. \n\nYour opinion is different. That's fine. Tell OP your opinion. I will not change mine.\n\nOP, I repeat, YTA and shortsighted at that.", ">I definitely agree that I disagree.\n\nYes, you've made that abhorrently clear, thanks.", "Respectfully, what a load of cow poo.

Lol", "Everyone have the right to have a different opinion, I agree with you on that.\n\nI just don't think that expecting 16 y.o. kid to deal with his, his brothers and SB mental issues on his own without any support from their shitty parents is reasonable.
