Dad met Shantell 6 years ago and they got married 2 years ago. Her son is 10. My brother and I have known Shantell and her son for almost 4 years now but not 4 years yet. Shantell's son Kyle is an only child, has no dad, no extended family, and he latched onto me fiercely when we met. It was frustrating how he'd insert himself into stuff with my brother. He'd invite himself along. He would try to touch me and hold onto me and my dad and Shantell told me to allow it and hug him when I'd tell them it made me uncomfortable and annoyed me. Eventually I started to stop him and tell him not to touch me and not to cling to me.\n\nDad and Shantell realized the three of us hadn't bonded the way they wanted us to, for Kyle, so they insisted on leaving me with both him and my brother and having me babysit them while they left the house. This was during the day and night. Dad would also set up times where I had to take them to the park.\n\nSo I should bring up my brother and I are close, like super close. We lost our mom, all four grandparents and our only uncle (we have aunts) in the space of like 3 years. Losing them made us closer. I was always an affectionate big brother (my mom used to say that) and our relationship is so easy and natural that we hug, or I'll ruffle his hair or he'll sit on me sometimes if he wants something. None of it is forced and it just kind of happens.\n\nKyle saw a lot of that during the forced babysitting, the forced park trips, etc. And he never got to hang all over me or be my shadow like he wanted and I'm not affectionate with him and it's caused him to have trouble dealing with stuff. Shantell was concerned and so he went to therapy for that. He admitted to being jealous and that he hates my brother. But he also wants me all to himself. He's still in therapy but he told Shantell that he's never going to be happy not being my brother.\n\nShantell and dad blamed it all on me. They said I had a responsibility to Kyle to be a good brother to him and that it was my job as the oldest to look out for him and make sure I was loving him the same as I love my brother. My dad has brought it up a couple of times on his own as well and the last time I told him that he and Shantell should look at themselves, because they knew Kyle was seriously clingy with me and they sent him out with me and my brother knowing we're close and have an affectionate relationship and did nothing to make sure he'd be okay. He told me I should have put my own feelings aside and done what Kyle needed me to do. Shantell was like how dare I blame them and she called me evil for blaming them when I have destroyed her son.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678101074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jvy5g/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_and_his_wife_need_to/", "score": 2392, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kyle should have been told that the two of you are brothers, plus you've both suffered the same serious losses in a very short time. That means the two of you have a special bond. Kyle needs to be taught his bond with you will be different because of that. And he cannot force it, otherwise, that will only drive you further away.\n\nAnd no one should ever be forced to accept affection and clinginess from someone if it makes them uncomfortable. You have the right to pick and choose who's allowed to touch you.\n\nI worry about you, to be blunt. In a few years, you're going to be able to live on your own. And you're going to want to have contact with your brother.

Just watch out for your brother and the kid does sound like someone who may do something to your brother. Its just my gut feeling speaking and thought of mentioning it. \n\nIf you don't feel like it, refuse the forced baby sitting and tell your dad to find someone else for the kid to play with.

Family therapy might even be the way to go here as well, since your parents are trying to force emotions instead of foster them. Kyle clearly is trying to fill a void in his life and I feel sorry for him, but you can\u2019t be forced to fill it. Blending families is hard, but it\u2019s not your responsibility as one of the children to make the dynamic work by forcing a relationship that isn\u2019t there with Kyle.

Who knows, it may have been something he has always dreamed of having. Then he has to watch you and your brother be all buddy buddy, and its okay to be that way, but he immediately feels left out. So now he still doesn't have the big brother he has always dreamed of because you've decided you don't want to fill that role for him. Once again, thats your choice and you are entitled to make it, but throw the poor kid a bone every now and then.

(You should offer to go talk to that therapist and fill him/her in on your side of the situation.) But unless you are actively being mean to Kyle, and I don't think it sounds like you are, none of that is your fault.

Step family relations are never easy and can't be forced. That's exactly what your dad and Shantell tried to do, from the start. Force someone on you that you hadn't expected in your life and forced you to love him, straight away, like a brother. That is very rarely going to work.\n\nThey should have taken things gently, realised Kyle was attached but you were struggling, and supported you with that. Throwing you all together on your own was NOT the right approach. \n\nTheir parenting skills during this have been dodgy, to say the least.

Do you have any trusted teachers or friends parents you can talk to about this? It isn\u2019t fair for them to force you into this. Kyle will never be your full blooded sibling who has been through hell and back with you. Only you and your brother understand what you went through.

He\u2019s in therapy for a reason and it\u2019s hard for me to believe a relationship with you is the core reason. You\u2019re young and blaming you is unfair. Shantell is evil for calling you evil. No one should be allowed to touch you unless it\u2019s with your consent. Would Shantell appreciate you telling her to let someone touch her, I think not. Her son is her responsibility, bottom line. She can\u2019t make you feel anything other than what you do. Hopefully she is in therapy also. As far as your father he needs to get his head out of his ass and come up with better solutions. Kyle attitude towards your brother is concerning.

I'm not saying do what you do with your brother because the 2 relationships will never be the same but maybe in time with out parent intervention or force maybe you and Kyle can have a different kind of brother relationship.", "NAH\nI will go against the grain, while you are 16 and sure it\u2019s not your only responsibility as a child\u2026 he is 10 years old. He is a little kid. And in his eyes you ARE his brother and, hoping your parents will stay together, he is here to stay for the long ride. \nHaving a good and healthy relationship with him is a benefit to him, but also for you!\nIt\u2019s not your parents fault if they have push for it, you all still leave under the same roof, any parents will have promote it. \nAnd you do have some responsibility on him. It\u2019s quite normal for parents of multiple children to ask each of them to step into house duties accordingly to age and maturity. Mostly for older one is asked to supervise the youngest. If then your parents exploit this, I don\u2019t know. But into a certain degree it\u2019s normal. \nWhile you can\u2019t be forced to love him, you also can\u2019t force him to unlove you. Be grateful he does as it\u2019s easier to be on the detached (loved) side of the stick then the attached (unloved) side. It\u2019s wrong from your parents to pretend you love him as much as your brother, but you also seem like to want to esclude him, from your post seems almost like you resent him for his love.

You don't have to be Kyle's brother if the feelings aren't there. But I think one important thing as we grow up and become more mature is to recognize that love and kindness aren't something where you only have a limited amount to give. You can still be really close to your brother and have a special bond with him you don't share with anyone else and also be kind to Kyle. I'm sure you've heard of the organization Big Brothers Big Sisters where they match older role models with younger people in need of someone to be a positive influence in their life.

You simply cannot be a parent or a counselor for this kid.\n\nI suggest that when your dad and his wife try to pressure you, casually bring up Child Protective Services. \"Hey dad and Shantell, I can see how frustrated we all are about Kyle's behavior. The fact is, *as a minor under 18 years old myself*, I simply have no idea how to be the parent/role model for a dusturbed kid like Kyle who obviously needs to see a professional mental health therapist who is qualified to help Kyle deal with whatever his issues are.

It was there from the very first time we saw each other and it's intense and not in a good way. My dad and Shantell just decided that we would suddenly start staying home, change the schedule, so I would babysit. That was not something they did naturally. It was intended to force bonding. But it was never going to work. Same thing with the park. I wasn't offering to take my brother. I was told I was taking him and Kyle whether I had planned to take anyone or not.\n\nI have reached the point where I dislike all interactions with him and if I could choose would stay out of his way. The truth is I don't see that changing either when my dad refuses to help and expects me to suck it up and love him and be his brother. In two years they are only going to screw it up more because I will have moved out and if Kyle still has this OTT attachment to me he's going to be crushed when I'm not around anymore.

It\u2019s cruel to all involved.\n\nMaybe you can proactively define your relationship with Kyle, if you are willing to think about what you would actually feel comfortable with. Step sibling is a different role than sibling and they both have value, they really do. For me, that meant sharing different hobbies and jokes with my younger stepsister even though I was always closer to my bio sister.\n\nIf you can come up with a plan to bring to the adults, you may be able to get their backing on this. Loop your brother in too, make sure he knows what you\u2019re trying to do. It might be worth talking to a therapist yourself to work out next steps and get clear on what you want to do.\n\nLeaving you with the two younger kids set you all up for failure because that made it a direct competition for your attention. A better approach is to build relationships individually: one-on-one time for you and Kyle, for Kyle and you brother, and for you and your brother. Instead they are just shoving Kyle in to an established dynamic and wondering what went wrong (my eyes are rolling so hard at them).\n\nAll of this should have been done and discussed before the adults ever moved in together, btw. I\u2019m so sorry you have to navigate this without their help. I hope my advice doesn\u2019t come off as telling you to clean up their mess, I\u2019m just sharing from my own blended family experience some strategies that I hope will help you pick up the pieces.", "Could you not reach out to your mums sisters and explain the situation, is there any possible way yourself and your brother could move in with other family, if this doesn\u2019t work maybe speak to your school? I know it\u2019s probably tough but I honestly think something needs to be in place to protect your brother from him when you leave.. your dad has made it clear he doesn\u2019t prioritise his sons, just his wife and her kid", "It isn\u2019t wrong of your dad to demand you be nice to Kyle. It also isn\u2019t wrong to occasionally ask you to babysit. \n\nKindness and occasional help is as far as it goes though. Everything else is on the parents.", "NTA- but Dad and Step Mom are.  You are not responsible for Kyles issues.  The adults need to deal with that.  I hope you go away to college at 18.  \n\nI hope therapy helps Kyle.  The parents also need counseling.  Good Luck to you and your little bro.", "BIG NTA and also screw the parents that say for their kids to \"put their feelings aside\". You are not a robot.", "I'm stuck between no assholes here and everyone sucks. \n\nFor your Dad and your Stepmom, It's reasonable for them to desire you becoming a single family unit, but it's not realistic to expect it to actually happen. Providing opportunities to encourage bonding like babysitting Kyle is reasonable, you have to learn to live together after all. However, guilting you for not developing an attachment from those activities is an asshole thing.\n\nFor you, not developing a relationship that doesn't feel right is reasonable. Not being touched when you don't want to be touched is a basic expectation for any relationship. However, obivous displays of affection in front of Kyle is an asshole thing to do. Imagine living with a friend that has a sibling, and every time you walk into the room, your friend ignores you and lets their sibling sit on their lap, exchange snuggles, and love. Kyle has had to be your third wheel for years, and yeah, that's a little emotionally damaging. Yeah you were/are young, but part of growing up is learning to read the room. It's not your fault he's living in a house where he has to watch a close family he can never be a part of, but it is your fault for not empathizing a little more.\n\nFor Kyle, I feel bad for him, but he's going to have to learn in therapy that he is responsible for his own happiness. You are in an inconvenient situation; he is in a desolate and lonely one. He's clearly young, so I can't in good faith label him an asshole, but he does need to learn how to respect boundaries.\n\nYou should adjust your behavior for Kyle to be more empathetic, but that does not mean becoming the big brother he never had. You don't have to be friends, but you should at least become a good housemate/roommate.  Develop some situational awareness about how you and your brother act in front of Kyle. You don't have to be friends to be friendly, because right now it sounds like you're a little cold and distant, which can have a backfire effect of making him want to be close to you more and earn your approval. Being a friendly does not mean being a pushover either; you can keep all of the boundaries, and you should voice to your parents that bonding activities aren't going to cut it.", "NTA. Wow your Dad and Shantell are serious assholes. They don\u2019t even bother putting in the effort to raise this kid and just heap it all on you and guilt you for not wanting to raise this kid.

You are not responsible for this kid or his feelings. You\u2019re a kid yourself and it sounds like your dad has abandoned you emotionally when you\u2019ve already dealt with so much loss i your life.

And because of that, people here are accusing a now-10 year old of harassment, obsession, future physical violence, and all sorts of nasty things. It just makes me sick that commenters think this way. Instead of just showing simple kindness, it\u2019s better to recommend abandonment, coldness, exclusion, and lots of other unhealthy behaviors towards a 10 year old.

It doesn't mean that he should by any means get special treatment BUT you said it yourself. He doesn't have a dad or any extended family. It's just him and his mom and it's been that way for basically 10 years. that has been his family. Just him and his mom... and now, after 10 years of that being his ONLY family he is now sharing that mother with a whole man (your dad) and both you and your brother. \n\nNowhere in here did you once mention that she is actually bad to you kids. just that they tried to get you guys to do activities together so you can bond. which is entirely reasonable. you are a family unit. bonding is important. no, you shouldn't be FORCED to hang out with this kid but you're 16. you're the oldest. out of the 3 of you, if you were as affectionate and compassionate as you claim to be, you should have been able to easily see that this kid just wanted to be a part of the family he now has to share the only family he had with. \n\nthe only reason he \"hates\" your brother is cause he can clearly see that you are and have been intentionally excluding him from the very beginning.

Like it or not, Kyle's a part of the family, and his family is a part of your dad's family, and it doesn't seem like they're going anywhere. Unless you want to go NC with Kyle, Shantell, AND your dad, you could at the very least take the kid out for some ice scream or something.

It\u2019s a tough-as-hell family problem where everyone is floundering together.\n\nThis is a lot to put on you. You\u2019ve had a lot of loss and it makes sense that you and your brother are super close. And I can see why, especially at your age, welcoming Kyle with open arms is not your prerogative. Your parents aren\u2019t solving the problem with forced time together, but they are trying to get their blended family to bond (albeit unsuccessfully), which doesn\u2019t make them AHs. It makes them misguided in their approach. They have put Kyle in therapy, which is the right choice, and they are asking you to be more open to your step-brother, which is not unreasonable, although it may feel that way to someone your age.\n\nIt is sad to read about a young child being excluded by his step-siblings and having such intense attachment issues. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s in therapy. He\u2019s too young to see any type of bigger picture. He wants time with you and is blaming what he sees as the obstacle: your brother. That\u2019s really unfair and difficult for your brother, too. I feel for all of you.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair that as the eldest, so much onus is on you to set a good example and take care of the younger kids. I also have to wonder how open to Kyle you have ever been. Has always been an annoyance in your eyes? Is he also a person, or just a problem to you?\n\nYour parents are not 100% to blame for everything bad you feel or Kyle\u2019s behavior. Parents are of course RESPONSIBLE for their kids, but if parents could CONTROL everyone their kids do, well, the world would look a lot damn different. \n\nYou all are busy blaming each other. That must feel terrible. Instead of pointing fingers, tell your parents you are tired of throwing blame around and ask them if you all can agree on some concrete next steps. You can ask not be forced to babysit and to stop being blamed for a child whose behavior you do not control. Perhaps you and your parents can work together to identify some things you can all agree to approach differently to improve the family dynamic. Ideally, it would be your parents driving these convos, but they aren\u2019t, so you can try. Being a part of the soliton is going to feel a lot better than trying to decide who is to blame.\n\nI will mention one other thing\u2026 you say a Kyle has never had a father. But that\u2019s not true. He has your dad, his step-father. And when your dad and step-mom married, they both took on responsibility for ALL the kids in the family.

Your father could be that strong figure for him, but sounds like he doesn\u2019t see or want to be bothered with that responsibility. It also sounds like their turning you into a parent and having to shoulder his emotional needs. \n\nSo here what you can do, ask for family counseling", "NTA you shouldn't have to deal with this little clingy kid, its not your problem you and your brother have a better relationship", "NTA\n\nseems all too common that the parents of blended families just aren't able to accept the fact that their kids just might not bond the way that they might've had they been siblings from the start. really sad that they put all this onto you", "NTA. \n\nWhy do parents always have this rosy picture of how blended families are going to work? It can be so so disruptive for children, and all three children are losers in this unhappy situation. It is utterly silly for your parents to think leaving the three of you alone together will somehow magically mend things when it's already not working - they are literally walking away from the problem and just hoping it gets better.\n\nOP, I am going to assume that you want a few things: 1) you want to keep your special bond with your brother; 2) You want your father to have your back; 3) assuming you are going to have your Dad's wife and her son in your life going forward, you want a more stable and happy family, overall. \n\nI think that if you and your family are going to be happy, you probably need to be a bit more intentional in how you bond. What about if as a family you alloted special time in different combinations, and agree to treat those times as sacred and special? You and your bio brother need time together; you and he and your Dad need special time together. Your step-brother needs time with both of you, too. And, you need time together as a whole family.\n\nI don't think you are totally responsible for your step-brother. In fact, it mostly - almost entirely - lies with your parents. But you do have some responsibility because you are older and just because that is what good people do...they keep healthy boundaries and should not always do things at their own expense but they also do what they can to make positive outcomes for everyone. They understand that the cost of resentment is very high over a lifetime and that having friends and allies means helping out where we can. The reality is, exclusion can turn people mean, and create quite a lot of emotional problems. You do not want that in your family and so if there is a way you can contribute without violating your boundaries, consider it. \n\nBut, what you contribute to the family and your step-brother needs to be commensurate with your age, and respectful of the losses you have suffered, and your own needs. Maybe your father found relief from the pain of loss of your mum through a new relationship, as many adults do. It is such an easy way for adults to cope...But for you, perhaps you have found relief by keeping a tight bond with your brother. If that is the case, your father needs to understand that.\n\nProblematically, it is very difficult for parents to listen deeply to their own children. Parents can be incredibly defensive because it brings up their own emotional wounds.  And your Dad sounds naive in his emotional skills if he thought leaving kids who don't together will lead to good results. It would likely be easier for your Dad to hear your perspective in therapy where the therapist can act as a nuetral party and help facilitate communication.\n\nGood on you for surviving losing a parent and being a loving brother and having boundaries.

The 16 year old doesn't wish to place himself in his youngest brother's shoes because in his mind he has no need for another brother.", "I think it's because some people do not see kids as having agency or any kind of autonomy over their own lives. Since they hold that view, that means the child should do whatever the parents want them to do and not having feelings about it. If the child doesn't agree, they are being disrespectful, bad, etc and it is wrong that they have those feelings and need to stop it.", "They shouldn't have even gotten married until this was resolved. Now everyone is living in purgatory so dad could dip his nib.", "Can you phone his therapist and tell them about what is happening?  My guess is they are getting a very different story from Kyle mom and dad.", "I would probably tell a teacher. They are mandatory reporters, and I wonder if even the sniff of CPS getting involved is enough to get the parents to listen.", "Do you plan to move out at 16? Where would you go?", "A human being is mentally mature in their twenties not teens. Stop trying to force adult responsibilities on children.", "I would hope they could mandate some sort of family therapy tbh, Kyle\u2019s mom isn\u2019t helping her son *or* stepsons by undermining his understanding of healthy boundaries like this and Kyle\u2019s individual therapy will be an uphill battle if it\u2019s being counteracted by his own parents.", "NTA", "I have 2 items for this post so I'll keep it super short:\nThe first one is the obvious part; your right to treat the people around you without obligation. Many posts will have better in-depth version of this.\nThe second item is that your parents had made it worse by making it an expectation. When that happens you push back harder. Possibly if everyone is mature enough, you could have started a friendship with your step brother, possibly even a close loved one eventually. But the fact that your parents put this on you as a responsibility is not just at all.\nNTA.\nPls...if you want to have a conversation with your parents, let them understand you don't mean to be defensive and dismissive. This is how you feel. And this is how the internet feels. It is not perfect but you can't force a HEALTHY relationship.", "That math at the beginning is gnarly! They\u2019ve been married 4 years but you\u2019ve also only known them that long?\n\nThey should realize that you should have had them in your lives before they got married and maybe you would have bonded more.", "Unpopular opinion here- while I don't think you're TA for not wanting him to touch all over you and I think it's wrong for your dad and stepmother to blatantly force the relationship I do believe that you are in the wrong for other things. \nI understand that you have a close relationship with your little brother but the 10y old is also now your brother. He is 5 years younger than you and he looks up to you.\nAs a parent, I would want all my children to feel welcomed and it seems by what you are saying, you aren't doing that. 16 is a hard age and you are still so immature but put yourself in his shoes. Have you ever felt excluded in a friend group? What if it was you in his shoes?\nBe the older sibling and spend good quality time with him. He just wants and needs love.", "Thank you for taking such good care of your brother. As a mom of two boys, \n\n>I was always an affectionate big brother (my mom used to say that) and our relationship is so easy and natural that we hug, or I'll ruffle his hair or he'll sit on me sometimes if he wants something. None of it is forced and it just kind of happens.\n\nthis made me happy cry. You brother is so lucky, as are you. I'm so moved by you. Best to you, always.\n\nNTA", "NTA  This is something a 16 year old should not be expected to be responsible for and I am sorry that you are having to deal with this on top of all the things that already come with growing up.  I did want to say something that at your age might not have occurred to you (and that's okay).  I feel sorry for Kyle too.  Perhaps from Kyle's perspective, it was him and his mom.  Then his mom met your dad and he had to share mom.  Maybe he was feeling a bit insecure and like the third wheel.  Have you ever felt like \"the third wheel\" - example -  you have two friends you do things with, but then the two friends become friends and they start doing things but don't invite you or they do but interact mostly with each other leaving you feeling ignored and left out?    Mom thinks it's okay for Kyle to not have mom exclusively anymore because your dad has kids so you can all be friends.  Maybe mom told him how great it was going to be having a big brother and another one closer to his age.  Except you and your brother have a very close bond that Kyle couldn't join, leaving him to again feel like the third wheel.  Maybe he thought latching onto you would make you like him more.  When you told him and his mom and your dad that you were uncomfortable with it, they should have worked with Kyle to find a way that he could interact with you that you were comfortable with.  It's not your responsibility to help Kyle accept the changes to his family dynamic and find how he fits into it.  The adults should be supporting and helping him.  You have every right to your feelings and boundaries.  I tried to look at things from Kyle's perspective as someone seeing his family in pairs and he has no one to pair with.", "NTA. I'm sorry your stepbrother is unhappy, but you are in no way responsible. From the point of view of an adult and a parent, I would say their actions have made it very unlikely you and your brother will ever be close with him.  But, that doesn't cause someone to need therapy.  I think he may have other issues, or maybe is suffering because his mom is not giving him enough attention.", "NTA.  Sounds like Shantell and your dad are a good match. Neither of them are accountable for poor parenting.", "NTA- and major kudos to you for being wise and mature beyond your years. It really does take a lot of emotional maturity to see this situation for what it is, and I\u2019m sorry your father and stepmother have failed to see that.  I\u2019m so glad your brother has you in his life to look up to and set an example for him.", "NTA. Yikes. \n\nI already have a weird thing about touched and very very big boundaries in general. I can\u2019t imagine having this much patience and not losing my shit when my boundaries are being trampled. \n\nYou\u2019re a good kid OP. I hope you can get away from all this crazy sooner than later.", "Absolutely NTA, it's not your fault you don't like being touched by someone else's kid that isn't you're sibling, plus you can't force relationships. It honestly should be your father's role of being a father figure to him since he is his step dad... Not you.", "NTA. What concerns me is where he said that he was jealous of your little brother and want to be your little brother. I'm sure it's just words but that's a cry for lack of attachment. He doesn't have healthy ways to interact and your parents aren't helping. What is his doctor telling them to do? They can't force you to have a relationship with him. That's something that builds over time or doesn't build at all. He may suffer abandonment issues and using you as the male role model. I would say be patient with him but stand your ground at the same time. If you don't help teach him boundaries he will never learn.", "NYA. I would really try so hard to explain to your step-brother about the kind of bond you have with your brother and why yours and Kyle\u2019s will be different. I cannot blame a 10 year old for wanting a great bond with an older teen, almost adult. Your parent and step-parent are the AH in this situation, but try not to blame and punish Kyle too much. Just explain the best you can to him why it\u2019s going to be different and see if there\u2019s anything in your heart to try with him, like the movies or roller skating or anything. If it doesn\u2019t work or you don\u2019t want to, then I 100% understand but just understand that your anger and frustration is with your parents, not Kyle.", "NTA \n\nThis kid came injured and she did nothing to heal him other than give him to an adolescent doctor to fix him. If they wouldn't have  pushed you I'd bet you wouldn't resent him being around. But they had to push you together before you were ready and now it can't be fixed except by even more therapy sessions than the few dozen if caught earlier.", "When will parents learn. NTA", "I\u2019m not passing judgment on children but there should have been some family therapy happening here & for that reason alone the parents are TA", "NTA - You're not at fault and they're hypocritical to try and say you should change your entire life for them but they won't even do the bare minimum. \n\nPlease know you're not being an asshole and it's completely healthy to have boundaries.", "Agreed. It was evil for Shantell to call OP evil. A parent should know how that affects a child\u2019s self image. NTA.", "Chances are zero, not almost zero. A clean slate is always easier to work with. This slate has been shat on for 4 years. OP\u2019s dad had one chance at getting it right and they went about it in the worst way possible. The clock can\u2019t be turned back and it\u2019s not like all the boys can be de-aged for attempt 2. Maybe if they had some self awareness they might be able to salvage something but that comment about how the brothers have damaged Kyle speaks volumes. In their minds it\u2019s still not their fault. They still haven\u2019t figured out how it was their actions that started all this.", "I think OP should contact one of his aunts and tell them what's happening. Maybe they can help. NTA", "Agreed. \nCan you maybe get your own therapist under the guide of learning how to accept Kyle (only to get them to agree and pay for it) and then tell the therapist everything, get as much on record as you can as well as concerns for your brothers safety after Kyle's comment about his resentment/jealousy. Therapists are usually mandatory reporters when it comes to children's safety. You could also start with your schools guidance officers. Oh and it case it wasn't clear, NTA.", "Inserting himself into the call with OP's aunt was not ok and OP's dad and stepmom should've enforced that boundary.\n\nBut it is entirely possible to exclude someone while being directed to be physically inclusive. \n\nOP's parents didn't handle this well at all, but it  also sounds like OP was resentful and exclusionary from the beginning. \n\nNo, a 12 year old child shouldn't be expected to do the work of blending two groups of step siblings together. But Kyle was 6 and yeah, I would've expected the 12 year old to have a bit more compassion and acceptance for what amounts to a baby in comparison to himself.", "He's this needy and clingy with OP and not the father because he sees OP being close and affectionate, physically and emotionally, with OP's brother and that's the relationship he wants. \nIf he saw this relationship modeled between OP and OP's dad, he'd probably reach toward the dad. \n\nAnd being jealous and hating OP's brother because OP isn't treating him like his brother is actually pretty normal. \nThe way Kyle has thought about this, probably since he was much younger and even less mature, is that OP's brother is preventing OP from being the brother Kyle wants. \nIt has similar vibes to when kids get resentful and act out against new baby siblings because they see them getting attention that they want. \n\nIf Kyle were willingly included included as a sibling more and then also continued therapy since it's been so long, those feelings toward OP's brother would likely be resolved.", "They might hear it, but will they actually *listen* to it?", "You don't get to decide other people's relationships and it's just sad reading all your comments trying to justify it."]}
