Dad met Shantell 6 years ago and they got married 2 years ago. Her son is 10. My brother and I have known Shantell and her son for almost 4 years now but not 4 years yet. Shantell's son Kyle is an only child, has no dad, no extended family, and he latched onto me fiercely when we met. It was frustrating how he'd insert himself into stuff with my brother. He'd invite himself along. He would try to touch me and hold onto me and my dad and Shantell told me to allow it and hug him when I'd tell them it made me uncomfortable and annoyed me. Eventually I started to stop him and tell him not to touch me and not to cling to me.\n\nDad and Shantell realized the three of us hadn't bonded the way they wanted us to, for Kyle, so they insisted on leaving me with both him and my brother and having me babysit them while they left the house. This was during the day and night. Dad would also set up times where I had to take them to the park.\n\nSo I should bring up my brother and I are close, like super close. We lost our mom, all four grandparents and our only uncle (we have aunts) in the space of like 3 years. Losing them made us closer. I was always an affectionate big brother (my mom used to say that) and our relationship is so easy and natural that we hug, or I'll ruffle his hair or he'll sit on me sometimes if he wants something. None of it is forced and it just kind of happens.\n\nKyle saw a lot of that during the forced babysitting, the forced park trips, etc. And he never got to hang all over me or be my shadow like he wanted and I'm not affectionate with him and it's caused him to have trouble dealing with stuff. Shantell was concerned and so he went to therapy for that. He admitted to being jealous and that he hates my brother. But he also wants me all to himself. He's still in therapy but he told Shantell that he's never going to be happy not being my brother.\n\nShantell and dad blamed it all on me. They said I had a responsibility to Kyle to be a good brother to him and that it was my job as the oldest to look out for him and make sure I was loving him the same as I love my brother. My dad has brought it up a couple of times on his own as well and the last time I told him that he and Shantell should look at themselves, because they knew Kyle was seriously clingy with me and they sent him out with me and my brother knowing we're close and have an affectionate relationship and did nothing to make sure he'd be okay. He told me I should have put my own feelings aside and done what Kyle needed me to do. Shantell was like how dare I blame them and she called me evil for blaming them when I have destroyed her son.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678101074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jvy5g/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_and_his_wife_need_to/", "score": 887, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kyle should have been told that the two of you are brothers, plus you've both suffered the same serious losses in a very short time. That means the two of you have a special bond. Kyle needs to be taught his bond with you will be different because of that. And he cannot force it, otherwise, that will only drive you further away.\n\nAnd no one should ever be forced to accept affection and clinginess from someone if it makes them uncomfortable. You have the right to pick and choose who's allowed to touch you.\n\nI worry about you, to be blunt. In a few years, you're going to be able to live on your own. And you're going to want to have contact with your brother.

Just watch out for your brother and the kid does sound like someone who may do something to your brother. Its just my gut feeling speaking and thought of mentioning it. \n\nIf you don't feel like it, refuse the forced baby sitting and tell your dad to find someone else for the kid to play with.

Family therapy might even be the way to go here as well, since your parents are trying to force emotions instead of foster them. Kyle clearly is trying to fill a void in his life and I feel sorry for him, but you can\u2019t be forced to fill it. Blending families is hard, but it\u2019s not your responsibility as one of the children to make the dynamic work by forcing a relationship that isn\u2019t there with Kyle.

So now he still doesn't have the big brother he has always dreamed of because you've decided you don't want to fill that role for him. Once again, thats your choice and you are entitled to make it, but throw the poor kid a bone every now and then.

(You should offer to go talk to that therapist and fill him/her in on your side of the situation.) But unless you are actively being mean to Kyle, and I don't think it sounds like you are, none of that is your fault.

Step family relations are never easy and can't be forced. That's exactly what your dad and Shantell tried to do, from the start. Force someone on you that you hadn't expected in your life and forced you to love him, straight away, like a brother. That is very rarely going to work.\n\nThey should have taken things gently, realised Kyle was attached but you were struggling, and supported you with that. Throwing you all together on your own was NOT the right approach. \n\nTheir parenting skills during this have been dodgy, to say the least.

Do you have any trusted teachers or friends parents you can talk to about this? It isn\u2019t fair for them to force you into this. Kyle will never be your full blooded sibling who has been through hell and back with you. Only you and your brother understand what you went through.

He\u2019s in therapy for a reason and it\u2019s hard for me to believe a relationship with you is the core reason. You\u2019re young and blaming you is unfair. Shantell is evil for calling you evil. No one should be allowed to touch you unless it\u2019s with your consent. Would Shantell appreciate you telling her to let someone touch her, I think not. Her son is her responsibility, bottom line. She can\u2019t make you feel anything other than what you do. Hopefully she is in therapy also. As far as your father he needs to get his head out of his ass and come up with better solutions. Kyle attitude towards your brother is concerning.

He is a little kid. And in his eyes you ARE his brother and, hoping your parents will stay together, he is here to stay for the long ride. \nHaving a good and healthy relationship with him is a benefit to him, but also for you!\nIt\u2019s not your parents fault if they have push for it, you all still leave under the same roof, any parents will have promote it. \nAnd you do have some responsibility on him. It\u2019s quite normal for parents of multiple children to ask each of them to step into house duties accordingly to age and maturity. Mostly for older one is asked to supervise the youngest. If then your parents exploit this, I don\u2019t know. But into a certain degree it\u2019s normal. \nWhile you can\u2019t be forced to love him, you also can\u2019t force him to unlove you. Be grateful he does as it\u2019s easier to be on the detached (loved) side of the stick then the attached (unloved) side. It\u2019s wrong from your parents to pretend you love him as much as your brother, but you also seem like to want to esclude him, from your post seems almost like you resent him for his love.

You don't have to be Kyle's brother if the feelings aren't there. But I think one important thing as we grow up and become more mature is to recognize that love and kindness aren't something where you only have a limited amount to give. You can still be really close to your brother and have a special bond with him you don't share with anyone else and also be kind to Kyle. I'm sure you've heard of the organization Big Brothers Big Sisters where they match older role models with younger people in need of someone to be a positive influence in their life.

You simply cannot be a parent or a counselor for this kid.\n\nI suggest that when your dad and his wife try to pressure you, casually bring up Child Protective Services. \"Hey dad and Shantell, I can see how frustrated we all are about Kyle's behavior. The fact is, *as a minor under 18 years old myself*, I simply have no idea how to be the parent/role model for a dusturbed kid like Kyle who obviously needs to see a professional mental health therapist who is qualified to help Kyle deal with whatever his issues are.

It was there from the very first time we saw each other and it's intense and not in a good way. My dad and Shantell just decided that we would suddenly start staying home, change the schedule, so I would babysit. That was not something they did naturally. It was intended to force bonding. But it was never going to work. Same thing with the park. I wasn't offering to take my brother. I was told I was taking him and Kyle whether I had planned to take anyone or not.\n\nI have reached the point where I dislike all interactions with him and if I could choose would stay out of his way. The truth is I don't see that changing either when my dad refuses to help and expects me to suck it up and love him and be his brother. In two years they are only going to screw it up more because I will have moved out and if Kyle still has this OTT attachment to me he's going to be crushed when I'm not around anymore.

That's going to form a very strong bond.\n\nAnd OP's father is actually insisting that OP form that same kind of bond with Kyle, overnight.
