She shouldn't even be screeching at you about them but her urge to destroy needs to be shut down hard.", "If you and your grandmother were on good terms before and this is unusual behavior for her, is it possible she's beginning to get some sort of cognitive issue like dementia or alzheimer's?\n\nNTA in any case - she caught you by surprise with that odd reaction.", "Ok, I have issue with the explanation for her behaviour. \n\nIf you grow up poor and don't want money wasted, the very last thing you'd do is try to ruin something new. \n\nIf this isn't a change of behaviour, I'd put more emotional and physical space between you and your Grandmother.
