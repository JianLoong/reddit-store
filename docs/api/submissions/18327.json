He earned his PhD in his mid90s, strutting his stuff onstage and everything \n\nSecond, I said MY GREAT grandmother grew up during that time. \n\nThird, the connection that I was making is that childhood traumas and habits (eg related to food or resource scarcity) can begin to manifest in odd ways in dementia patients. \n\nIn my great grandmother\u2019s case, and in OP\u2019s, there were issues of resource scarcity in childhood. I\u2019m saying that perhaps the SYMPTOMS of dementia might be presenting similarly in both cases. \n\nI am not saying that I suspect OP\u2019s grandmother grew up during the Great Depression or that this somehow caused her dementia.", "People can have kids late in life.
