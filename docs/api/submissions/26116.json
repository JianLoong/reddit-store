No biggie. He moved in before me and by the time I came, I found a lot of his stuff on what was supposed to be my side of the room so I asked him to move it.

If he's not playing music hours into the night, he's bringing people over and they sit on my bed. If it's not that, he's making messes in the room and not cleaning them up until told. But what has really pissed me off is his tendency of putting his food in my mini fridge without my permission ranging from stale leftovers to alcohol. His excuse is always \"there was an empty space so I thought...\". I'd repeatedly told him not to do this without asking me and that I'd gladly allow him to use it if he just asked but apparently he's too high above to be asking.\n\nMy final straw was when he put fucking laundry detergent in my fridge, LAUNDRY DETERGENT. And you wanna know what he said? One of his friends told him that refrigerated laundry detergent makes your clothes come out more cooler and silky. Hello logic? I told him to never put anything in my fridge ever again and if he did, I'd eat/use whatever it is because everything inside it would be mine. Eh? Yesterday I came back to find a plate of donuts and a pepsi can. He wouldn't learn so I ate 2 of the donuts and left the other with a few bite marks. I also drank most of the Pepsi.\n\nHe came back, opened my fridge without my permission infront of me, and immediately asked me why I ate his food.

Well played I\u2019d say. Good on the RA for having your back. \u2026. Roommate has been an asshole from day 1. I wouldn\u2019t give it another thought.", "Nta, you put your foot down and stopped putting up with his bs and he didn't like it. You honestly waited a lot longer than I did and I wouldn't have been as nice about it, so good for you.

We had one mini fridge, they won't let us have another one. (Two shelves) When she had food, she wanted to threw out mine to have enough space for hers. When I had food she wanted to eat mine or threw it out so she can buy for herself even though I NEVER used the full fridge. But she wanted it ALL. Because buying only one shelf worth food isn't enough for her, but I have to accept that I only can use \u00bc of mine. Because that's totally fine. She's better than me. Her diet is important.

Your roommate is harassing you, and I'm very glad the RA took your side.

One of my best friends from college also didn't lock her door when she started school.  It wasn't until some drunk guy mistook her room for his girlfriend's room and walked in while she was sleeping that she started locking the door. I think he was looking for the room nextdoor, so he wasn't too far off, but it showed that someone could and would walk in.  (We also went to school in the Midwest and she was also from a small town.  I feel like it's a relatively common thing in the Midwest.)\n\nUnfortunately, even though I locked my door, my roommate still had a key to let the guys in with her."]}
