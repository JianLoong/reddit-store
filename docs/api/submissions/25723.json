And that's why they're both still lying about their teacher.\n\nIt's ridiculous and immature, but as they are kids we expect them to be immature. Mostly, kids outgrow this sort of lying, so it's nothing to get too worked up about. Taking away the devices is a reasonable consequence. However, rather than tying it to \"until you stop lying\" I'd simply give an end date - you'll *never* be able to force Adrian to tell the truth, and you only undermine yourself when you stick to that. You really, *really* don't want to make it clear how little actual power you hold over him, and you don't want him to start thinking of you two as being adversaries in some way.\n\nInstead, it's best to make it clear that you don't believe him and don't intend to discuss the matter further, and he's grounded with some extra chores for a set amount of time.

There is no reason for him to make this kind of stuff up about him, painting him as a criminal.

You've got to nip this intolerance and behavior now. Your sister and your wife be damned (Not saying your wife should not be involved in child rearing decisions. I just get the impression she isn't this as seriously as it is). You are being a wonderful father. Just think of how many boys have a father that would think this is hilarious and might even go so far as rewarding their son for behaving this way.

Apparently they both think that it is logical that the busy, overworked and underpaid teacher has the time and energy to conspire against their little darlings.\n\nIt's past time to get these boys straightened out.  Not only should they not be in the same classroom, they would benefit from being in different schools, too - if that's possible.\n\nFifth grade can be a tumultuous age, but in my teaching experience they generally didn't get so incorrigible until the latter part of the year.\n\nStick to your guns, OP.

Edit: To be clear, I pretty much always think it's worth considering therapy, and this case is no different.
