Adrian and Edwin have always been pretty close to each other as they share the same interests and I, my older sister and our younger brother see each other all the time, his 2 daughters are not school age yet though. \r  \n\r  \nEdwin and Adrian can be challenging kids, especially Edwin. Both of them are into pretty niche anime, stuff like Pokemon and gaming, ect. They both have trouble accepting some kids aren\u2019t into their interests and got in trouble last year for that, they also both got in trouble for homophobic and sexist comments, which we are still working on with Adrian, and it\u2019s been a struggle.\r  \n\r  \nClaire\u2019s oldest son, Blaze, is a sweet kid, but he has a very rocky relationship with Adrian and Edwin, and he just normally watches baseball videos by himself when the family hangs out if he isn\u2019t at practice or with his friends.\r  \n\r  \nOn Friday, my wife and I got a call from Adrian and Edwin\u2019s teacher, telling us she was concerned about stuff the boys were saying, she said Edwin was saying Blaze was getting in trouble with the law and other concerning stuff about him, he also said his dad worked at Nintendo and said I worked for Tesla and that Adrian was going along with it and helping him elaborate on these stories. She was concerned as she had Blaze and remembered him as a sweet kid. I told her everything was made up and she then told me some other stories they were saying and it was just lie after lie.\r  \n\r  \nI talked to Adrian about it after he got home and he told me his teacher was lying and continued to make excuses. I told my son that until he told the truth, he would lose video game access, but he insisted he was telling the truth. \r  \n\r  \nMy wife was at a party for work when he came home, so I waited for her to come home again to confront him, but when I talked to her she told me Claire was telling her what happened according to Edwin and both had a detailed story about the teacher not liking them and lying about them and it seemed to match up.\r  \n\r  \nI then asked one of my coworker\u2019s about this and told him to ask his son who\u2019s also in the same class, his son told him Edwin and Adrian were \u201cfull of cr\\*p\u201d and that the teacher was telling the truth.\r  \n\r  \nAfter this, I took my son\u2019s devices (and even let him save the game he was playing), but he started crying claiming I was being too hard on him and when I asked my wife and sister about this, they seemed to agree. I\u2019m conflicted, I love Adrian and just want what\u2019s best for him, and I\u2019m worried that maybe I did go too far but Adrian and Edwin are sticking to their seemingly debunked stories. \r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1693233567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163nw45/aita_for_punishing_my_son_for_aiding_in_our/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don't set things right now, what will they grow up to become?", "NTA\n\nAnd what's even more troubling than the lying is that both your wife and your sister are refusing to hold the boys responsible for their actions with reasonable consequences. It may be time for you to request a classroom change so that they don't have easy access to each other to support the other in lying.", "NTA, but OMG dude, I'm scared of ~~what~~ who your kid is becoming.  I would separate the kids, then find out the source of the incel crap and cut it off too.  And I would get Adrian into therapy yesterday.\n\nI'm so sorry, OP.  Truly.", "NTA he needs to learn actions have consequences and  maybe needs to relearn the story of the boy who cried wolf. I'd also suggest the cousins have limited interactions and maybe should be in separate classes at school as they seem to be bad influences on each other.  Better to nip it in the bud now than when he's 17.", "NTA\n\nThere are consequences for actions.  Your kid was making up lies and behaving poorly, so his device should be taken away, if that's standard punishment.  \n\nYou and your wife need to  have a united front with the kids.  Always.  And your sister needs to worry about her own kids and not how you deal with your own.", "What's going through your wife's head and your SILs head?

Even after other kids in the same class are saying it happened?\n\nI get that 10 year Olds might think that lie would work, mainly because they're 10 years old. But these grown women, wth?\n\nOP you're NTA and seemingly the only adult here that's trying to do the right thing by these kids.

For people to believe them & for Blaze to get into trouble / be shunned?", "Ooh ooh, I know this one, they grow up to be criminals!!  Did I get it right?\n\nI mean, this is 1 week into 5th grade.  Imagine what will happen next year when they start middle school and are multiple teachers/classes and a LOT more freedom at school.\n\nI agree with others, get them put into different classrooms.  And possibly consider a parent/teacher/student/principal meeting to discuss what's happening.  It'll be a lot harder for the boys to tell you their lies when the teacher is there.", "They need to schedule a meeting with the teacher and the students all at once.", "I mean, I do agree that the lying needs to be corrected, but it's also not some harbinger of future criminality.  Lying is a normal developmental milestone that peaks right around age 10-11, and peaks higher for some kids than others.", "Successful politicians?", "For me a concern is that wife and sister default to the boys are right and the teacher is wrong.\n\nWhy would the teacher lie about this? This has nothing to do with the teacher. She isn't saying the boys are lying about her. She has no skin in the game here.\n\nBut both moms default to- the boys say the teacher is lying so they must be telling the truth.\n\nIt's just illogical to me.\n\n(but I agree with others, it sounds like its time for the boys to be in separate classes. I'm shocked that after they got in trouble last year, the administration didn't insist on it. If the boys are in such a small school that there is only one class for their grade- the answer might be that one of the boys has to be moved to another school.)", "Your wife and SIL are straight up embarrassing. What non brain damaged adult would believe these kids? Your son and nephew clearly think they\u2019re capable of getting away with whatever they want and it\u2019s because their mothers seem to want to let them do that. You\u2019re NTA but you would be if you let your son go down the path he\u2019s currently on.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not normal to be making sexist comments at their age, too. Little boys can be shitty at that age and can get really into saying things to shock people but this is pretty extreme."]}
