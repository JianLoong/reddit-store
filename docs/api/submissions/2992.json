We have known each other for 18 years.\n\nYears ago Lily introduced me to Susie (23F), who immediately became one of the most important people in my life. At the end of August I had a heavy fight with Susie that I can't fully recount the details of, because the post would be too long. We did not speak again for two months, and I was in a constant state of confusion because I did not understand the exact reason for this argument. So I decided to ask her to talk closely. We saw each other and I found out that the whole argument actually stemmed from lies that Lily fed me.\n\nLily has always had a lying problem. I never gave it much thought before because it never involved me personally, but let it be known that as early as age 14/15 because of a lie told by Lily, CPS was involved.\n\nI then noticed years of manipulation. I have a problem with guilt, and she has always used it to her advantage. A recent example: as I was pondering our relationship after the conversation with Susie, one day Lily asked me if we could get together for Halloween. I told her not to count me out for that day and she replied that it was fine, but she would be alone because she had turned down offers to go out with other friends to be with me (?).\n\nI decided to talk to her and I explained everything that I thought was not going well at all in the friendship. I told her about these situations in which I felt manipulated, about all the times she pestered me with messages even though I told her it was not a good time to talk to me about her problems, about how hurt I was that she used what I told her about her boyfriend when she vented to use it as a weapon against him (making him hate me as a result).\n\nShe responded to everything in a passive-aggressive manner, saying that she demanded an apology from me for the Halloween day, saying that she was tired of always being correct with everyone and receiving nastiness back (I never offended her and spoke very calmly), that she is always good with everybody and doesn't deserve this, and that her behaviors were due to her mental disorders.\n\nThis is where I may have been wrong, because I replied that if she has behaviors that hurt people, she can't hide behind the justification of her mental disorders. The result was that she now thinks I discriminate against mental disorders and that because I don't experience it personally I can't dare to talk about it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669146022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z22smk/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_cant_justify/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even people with mental illness and mental disorders have to be held accountable for their actions, that's part of how people get better. It's also healthy to discuss toxicity in friendships, that's how you have strong friendships and relationships - by setting boundaries, and establishing areas of discomfort in a relationship. Wish you the best, OP.", "Nta. I doubt she will ever change. Just cut ties with her. No reason to keep that friendship.", "Person with mental disorders here. You are correct! Yes. It at times makes things harder for us. No. It does not excuse us from being a good person or hurting people's feelings. Not holding someone accountable for their actions just because it's harder at times doesn't help them - being understanding that at times things are harder and being willing to talk it out does. It does not excuse us from owing apologizing and needing to work through our own issues - nor does it mean we can project our issues onto others and expect them to just put up with it.", "imo, nta\n\ni had a friend that would constantly hurt me and hid behind the wall that she didn\u2019t know any better because she was in her words \u201cmentally ill\u201d. It seems like your friend is trying to invalidate the way you\u2019re feeling, and is trying to make herself the victim in the situation since you came up to her and told her everything that was bothering you. The best way to put it is to look at it generally the same way as Kanye. He has mental disorders, but that doesn\u2019t justify for the horrible things he says and shares.", "NTA maybe it\u2019s time to cut ties and explain to her why, you don\u2019t owe anyone friendship and can drop \u201cfriends\u201d is they are toxic mental health issues or not. If her lying is something that she cannot control that isn\u2019t her fault either but she should be seeking help from professionals she needs to understand that people don\u2019t owe her anything either. Being mentally Ill is not an excuse to be awful to people.", "NTA\n\nMental differences can help explain why a person struggles with something, or that they require more support, etc. but it is never an excuse to treat people horribly. Especially if she knows that she has those mental differences. \n\nI think some people that say that are just aholes and don't want to take responsibility for their actions, so they pick a mental health issue to pin everything on.", "NTA - Mental health issues and disorders are explanations, not excuses.", "NTA\n\nA big part of learning to live with mental health issues is taking responsibility for our actions. There can be reasons we do the things we do, but we don't get to use them as excuses and just expect others to tolerate anything we do to them.", "Oh hell no you are NTA op.\n\nTrust me when I say it\u2019s best to cut a toxic friend like this out. I had to do it to someone I once thought of as a friend because they too lied so much and granted did have depression and stuff but it got so bad to the point where I freaked out once thinking they were going to commit die when they sent me a pic of a noose but when I tried to call them they didn\u2019t pick up. I was in the middle of a computer class when that happened. They didn\u2019t but still it was so bad that I had to cut them out otherwise it would have affected my mental health and well-being.\n\nDo what is best for you but personally I would cut someone like her out of my life.", "NTA.

I was told about by this post by a friend who said that it might have been posted by you OP. Let me clear up some of our situation so that reddit knows the real story.  I was abused from a young age and that's why I had to lie when I was younger. in order to get out of a bad situation at home. OP  you fully know this. I don't lie  now after therapy, which OP failed to mention. In addition,  I had spoken to Susie and she mentioned that you had been acting abusively towards and gaslighting her a lot recently and that some of your behaviour is quite bizzare.
