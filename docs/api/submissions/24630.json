He and his fianc\u00e9e just bought a house together and we'll be all moving into the house in a week. My dad has me (15f) and my brother (19m). His fianc\u00e9e has four kids (13m, 12m, 10m and 7f). The house is big enough for me, her 10 and 7 year olds to have our own room (her older two like sharing) but her daughter wants to share a room with me. She said she never had a sister before and the boys prefer each other to her so she'd love for us to be sister roommates and for her to get to share a room with her new sister. I heard her say this stuff and it wasn't totally surprising because she tries to be my shadow when she sees me. My dad's fianc\u00e9e loved the idea. My dad told her (fianc\u00e9e) they'd need to ask me first and when they asked I said no.\n\nI was asked why and I said I like my privacy and there's space for me to have my own room and that was the original plan. His fianc\u00e9e said it would be a great chance for us to bond and I said I don't care. I don't want to share the room. My dad said it was okay. He and his fianc\u00e9e argued over it. Then she asked me again and told me her daughter would be really upset if I said no. She asked if I didn't really want a sister and I said no. I had always loved and had a good relationship with my brother and never thought about having a sister. That sharing with her daughter would not fulfill some secret wish I've always had. It would just frustrate me when I was suppose to have my own room.\n\nMy dad's fianc\u00e9e is angry about my refusal and her daughter, as she predicted, was upset. She actually tried to talk me around which didn't work and only upset her more which led to her mom being angrier with me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692026599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qxqsd/aita_for_saying_no_to_sharing_a_room_with_my_dads/", "score": 1643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, the age difference is significant. OP is not being bratty or entitled.

They asked once, you said no, and that should have been the end of the conversation. There are plenty of ways for you to bond with this child that don't involve you compromising your privacy.

Make sure to write down what you're thinking, and approach him calmly, not in a moment of frustration or anger. And think long and hard about the behavior you've seen from your Dad's fianc\u00e9e.  Write down things she's said, things she's done.  *For her to be THIS angry about it says there's something else going on here.*  She has something she's trying to gain or something to lose if you don't comply. Sharing a room will not make you a closer family.  She knows that, she was a teenager once.   If I read it right, Dad agrees with you.  That should have been the end of it, but here you are.  So. \n\nHere's what I'm thinking.  She's got two boys, and you're the oldest (brother's already moved out), AND a girl.... this might be off, but I think she's trying to get you to be instant babysitter so her precious boys don't have to.   OR, she's hoping to worm you out of the picture.  If you have enough room for everyone, you said no, and she pushes for it, she KNOWS you don't want it.  She might be banking on that. You'll hate it so much you'll either 1. move out  or 2. avoid the house altogether.  Which gets you out of the way, and your Dad's attention is all on her kids. \n\nIf she really just wants you to bond, you can offer to spend one afternoon a week with her daughter, a couple hours of just you and her time.  Go to the park with her, or play in her room, etc etc. But that time does NOT have to compromise your privacy.", "NTA. What parents would even want their 7 year old to live with a teenager? Wouldn't they be more exposed to things they aren't mature enough for?", "Your dad and her mom are getting married. The primary relationship is between them. It'll be nice - like icing on the cake - if all the kids get along, bond, and turn into \"one big happy family\" \u2122. \n\nForcing the issue by trying to convince you that you want a roommate half your age isn't the way to do it. You'll have ample opportunities to bond without having to share a room. And why is it that step-sister's demands are more important than yours?\n\nBlood families don't always get along, and blended families are no different. Both the parents in your scenario are divorced, so they should understand pretty well that even people in close relationships don't always get along.\n\nNTA for not wanting what they want.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, stepmom is doing blended family wrong.  Lots of dynamic changes to relationships with a parent's new marriage.  But that doesn't mean you need to sacrifice yourself at the expense of others.  Especially in a situation like this.

I wouldn't ask a teenager over 13 to share a room with anyone if I could help it, they need privacy whereas younger children do not. Plus, sticking a kid under 10 with a teenager means the younger would be totally into the older kid's business 24/7 and the older kid would be stuck in a permanent babysitter role. That's super unfair to the older kid, even if they're related by blood. But when they're not, it's basically a punishment. It also means the adults would be all up in the older one's business 24/7 because little kids have no filter. Plus, teenagers can have dangerous things in their room that are age-appropriate for them, but not for a younger child. I don't know what they expected by asking you. It was a stupid idea.", "NTA.

If you want your own space, that's your choice. They can't force a bonding session with you. Also, there are different ways to bond, hanging out together or talking with one another during a meal.\n\nI still suggest that you try to at least have a positive relationship with her however, and explain that this isn't against her, it's just about your preference of not sharing the room.", "NTA - A teenager needs their own space and privacy, and if there are enough rooms available, it\u00b4s perfectly fine to ask for your privacy.   \n\n\nSure, diplomacy goes a long way, so maybe in how you communicate there might be some AH factor that you can improve on (but I really don\u00b4t know, so no judgement here), but explaining and asking for your own room is very reasonable here. Also, you don\u00b4t need to share a room to bond with your new sister.  \n\n\nSo unless your parents need the room, if you can opt to not share a room because you want your privacy, they have no reason to be upset with you. So explain it in a rational and reasonable way, that you prefer to have your own space and your own privacy, and that is hasn\u00b4t anything to do with a dislike of your stepsister, it\u00b4s just that if you can have your own room you\u00b4d prefer it.", "NTA. \n\nA teenage girl needs her privacy especially overnight.

He and his fianc\u00e9e just bought a house together and we'll be all moving into the house in a week. My dad has me (15f) and my brother (19m). His fianc\u00e9e has four kids (13m, 12m, 10m and 7f). The house is big enough for me, her 10 and 7 year olds to have our own room (her older two like sharing) but her daughter wants to share a room with me. She said she never had a sister before and the boys prefer each other to her so she'd love for us to be sister roommates and for her to get to share a room with her new sister. I heard her say this stuff and it wasn't totally surprising because she tries to be my shadow when she sees me. My dad's fianc\u00e9e loved the idea. My dad told her (fianc\u00e9e) they'd need to ask me first and when they asked I said no.\n\nI was asked why and I said I like my privacy and there's space for me to have my own room and that was the original plan. His fianc\u00e9e said it would be a great chance for us to bond and I said I don't care. I don't want to share the room. My dad said it was okay. He and his fianc\u00e9e argued over it. Then she asked me again and told me her daughter would be really upset if I said no. She asked if I didn't really want a sister and I said no. I had always loved and had a good relationship with my brother and never thought about having a sister. That sharing with her daughter would not fulfill some secret wish I've always had. It would just frustrate me when I was suppose to have my own room.\n\nMy dad's fianc\u00e9e is angry about my refusal and her daughter, as she predicted, was upset. She actually tried to talk me around which didn't work and only upset her more which led to her mom being angrier with me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you are happy with it maybe set aside some time to spend together each week so you can build that relationship.", "Stand your ground, no means no. The fianc\u00e9 needs to stop trying to manipulate you and your choices. The age gap is large and you both are different stages of life and you need your privacy. Explain to your dad what she is saying and you don\u2019t appreciate her not accepting your answers. She sounds like she is trying to push one big happy family regardless of the family true situation. Talk about boundaries and keep communicating with your dad.", "Nta, 7y and 15y \nNeed anyone say more? \n\nYou need your space, the house has it... you could be intentional with spending time with her if you wanted... but your dad and his fiance made the choice to blend families. \n\nThey asked, you answered.

You are 15, how could she possibly expect you to want to share a room with a 7 year old?!!!!!! That makes zero sense when there is plenty of room for you to have your own space. You don\u2019t need to share a room to \u201cbond\u201d. If anything I feel like being forced/guilt tripped into sharing with her would do the exact opposite and make you resent her and feel suffocated. Your stepmom needs to get a grip on reality and stop trying to push her daughter on you. If she doesn\u2019t I can guarantee it will backfire on her spectacularly and her vision of \u201cpicture perfect blended family\u201d will come crashing down real fast.", "NTA, sharing a house with a bunch of new people is already tough enough without sharing a room with a much younger child.\n\nThat said, you might consider inviting her to come spend the night in your room on occasion.

Besides, it should be the other way around: first you bond and then you decide you want to share a room, considering you're a teen.\n\nHowever, I think you should have a conversation with your step-sister. Explain to her that sharing a room is not what makes you sisters, that you'll get plenty of opportunities to spend time together as sisters, that you'll love having her as a little sister, and that you wouldn't want to share your room with anyone, it's not because of her. That way the sister will understand you're not rejecting her, just the sharing of the room.", "Ask for your own room and offer to have a \u2018sleepover\u2019 with her, or two.\n\nYou get your space and spend time with her that she will treasure.

He\u2019s doing a horrible job as your parent and protecting your interests.", "NTA, you're allowed to want privacy especially given that the situation isn't forcing you to need to have space.\n\nAs someone who's dad remarried when I was about your age, who is now much older. I'd encourage you to try to get along with your future step siblings and step mother but you're still entitled to reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, you\u2019re more than double her age. what would you have in common?

I probably wouldn't have said the part about not wanting a sister though it seems unnecessary and mean spirited even though you were put on the spot about it.", "Nta. I was one of 4 girls, and no teenage girl wants to share their space no matter how close they are to their sisters. Honestly my parents redoing the upstairs of their house to add 4 bedrooms (yes the 4 of us originally were crammed into one room) before my oldest sister was 13 was a godsend. You don't have to share a room to be close, the 4 of us would often leave our doors open and chat from our own rooms, we would choose to have sleepovers which eachother... When we wanted to. A 14 and 7 yr old have nothing in common from a mental and emotional standpoint", "Perhaps try explaining that you need your \u201calone time\u201d, and think of a few activities you might not mind doing with the step sister (if you ARE willing to spend some time with her, e.g., maybe some time you can do your nails together or watch a movie together).  Perhaps that might help them see that it\u2019s not personal, but at your age you do need alone time.   NTA", "NTA. However, if it helps, maybe ask your dad's fianc\u00e9 if she would be comfortable for her daughter to share your bed time, your video content play list and other age sensitive subjects. Also explain that you are not comfortable sharing your social life with her ( or other member of the family).\nThis does not have to be about you rejecting her daughter as a sister, but rather that you are at a stage of your life where you develop social connections independently and explore areas where privacy is key.", "NTA\n\nStay strong and good on your dad for not caving.

He needs to nix this **before** you move next week.", "NTA the age gap is so big that when you are an adult in 2 years, she will still be a child under 10. No sane adult wants to share with a kid that age. Your entire time will be spent telling her not to touch your things, being angry when she inevitably does touch them and worse break them. There is no positive for you in saying yes. She'll be upset but so what. You'll be upset if they make you share. She doesn't get her own way just by virtue of being younger. Nobody should be forced to share unless there is no other option. You can bond without having to share your sanctuary with her. You'll probably grow to like her and accept her a whole lot more in separate rooms than you would having her forced upon you", "NTA step mom is day dreaming about all the kids merging into one big happy family and is trying to force it. And having that extra bedroom open would probably make a nice study or craft room for her.", "NTA - but you could also say it\u2019s because of the age difference. You are a teen and teens need/deserve privacy. Your new step sister is 7, she\u2019s just a little kid still. I think your compromise is that you find an activity that you and this younger girl can share (I don\u2019t know, something crafty or a sport or something) and she can then \u201cbond\u201d with you over that and you get to maintain your privacy.", "If they want you to have a happy relationship with the 7 year old, the best thing they can do is leave your rooms separate.

I'll never fully understand because my brother is my best friend and he and I are close. I never felt like I missed out on a sister. I have never longed for a sisterly relationship. I have friends who are girls and guys. And I have always been able to fit with both. I think she's seeking something I wouldn't be able to give her.", "Ooh that cuts right to the core", "NTA-  this is a recipe for resentment and problems between the two of you.  \n\nForcing what is easier vs letting a relationship build.  \n\nI can see why she\u2019s excited: she has been able to idealize a sister when her brothers were being shit.  But you are a real person with your own needs.  \n\nMy sibling and I didn\u2019t really get along until after we both graduated high school.  These things take time.  \n\nHopefully you won\u2019t have to share a room, but maybe find another way to get to know each other. Yes she will seem babish to you right now.  But nobody fights in your corner like a good sister.", "Oh yes- 7 yr olds have zero filter, they will flat out ask anything that comes to mind. 15 yr olds tend to be smart asses, and they\u2019ll honestly answer any question that comes their way.\n\nIt\u2019s a recipe for disaster", "This!! OP has 3 - 4 more years there at minimum, so she may as well try to make the best of it. Decorating a 7 yo room could be fun while fulfilling the idea of bonding. Check that off your list and when you're asked to babysit or anything else - we've already bonded when we decorated the room.", "Yeah I agree. Living in the same house they may eventually get a good familial relationship (not always tho) but with that age difference they are never likely gonna be \u201cfriends\u201d they will be at very different stages of life for the large majority of it if not all of it.", "My sister is almost 10 years older than me and we were very close and shared a room until she left for college.  But the difference was that she waited 10 years and 2 brothers to get me, and from the time I was born I was her \u201calive doll\u201c.  By choice she used to drag me with her anywhere she was allowed to take me. I even spent at least one weekend per semester in her dorm with her while she was in college.  **But, as I said, she spent years hoping for me - I wasn\u2019t sprung on her.**", "I really like this suggestion. It\u2019s not the seven year olds fault the parents are being awful and I hope OP can still make it a positive relationship between the two of them without giving into the insane demands of her parents. \n\nLike yes Op absolutely needs her own space but maybe the two of them can go on a walk together. Seven year olds are also pretty cool, and you can hang out with them without feeling like babysitting and you can have conversations and stuff. So as long as OP sets good boundaries for herself (like the room situation) they should be able to have a good relationship.", "Here\u2019s some reasonable examples of why a 15 year old rooming with a 10 yr old should be avoided in almost every circumstance\n\n- PMS & general teenage angst\n- sexual curiosity and personal pleasure\n- na\u00efve questions like \u201cbut why does your bra have that Lacey stuff if no one\u2019s supposed to see it\u201d\n- well-meaning answers about \u201cwhy there\u2019s hair down there\u201d\n- exposure to inappropriate song lyrics or mature tv shows\n\nSpeaking as an older sister, sisterhood is 90% fighting, stealing each others clothes, nosy questions, constant bickering. And if one of you is going through puberty and experiencing PMS, add a lot more yelling and tears.\n\nIf their honest goal is for them to be close, the last thing they should do is force them to live in the same room.", "I would believe it came from future stepsister because she has always wanted to spend time with me and seeks me out so much. This feels like it was something she saw as a real dream come true. But I don't want to share just to make her happy. I'd be miserable if I was forced to share with her.", "Yeah, it's a big gap. My two daughters are 3.5 years apart and they shared a room for a few years until about this time last year as my eldest (11 at the time) was about to start high school. Their bedtimes are different, how they want to keep their rooms is different. A bigger age gap would make this even more difficult.", "The problem with that is that she\u2019ll end up just moving into the room. Say once every three months but it will end up being every other day and then every day. Once it starts it won\u2019t stop", "7 y o just going to be barging in at all times with that", "That was all she said until stepmother to be kept pushing and insisting on answers. Should OP have just lied?", "I disagree with this - the only hurt party is the 7-year-old, who's clearly been given unrealistic expectations by her mother. If SM had communicated from the start that they wouldn't be sharing a room, there'd have been no hurt feelings. This wasn't OP's problem to fix.", "That\u2019s not all she had to say as they kept asking.", "Wow came here to post the exact same thing!

But I have heard some truly insane cases of ridiculous dream-scenarios parents convince themselves will be the situation with their kid and step-kid", "Yeah I understand, that\u2019s perfectly fair and not your obligation. She\u2019s young, parents obviously aren\u2019t together (don\u2019t know the situation with dad there), she\u2019s moving into a new house with new people and is seeing great sibling relationships around her but not with her. It\u2019s gotta be really tough to handle at that age.\n\nYou don\u2019t ever have to form a sisterly relationship but try to treat the kid good, her mom is at fault for getting her hopes up with this, not you. Hopefully she can form some of that closeness she\u2019s looking for with someone closer to her age (at school or another activity) but it\u2019s not at all shocking that you won\u2019t magically feel a sisterly connection with a child half your age just moving in, that\u2019s not fair to put on you and expect.", "That\u2019s a nice fantasy, but it\u2019s highly unrealistic. I have a younger sister, and when I was 14 she was 7. As adorable as she was her constant curiosity got on my every nerve, she\u2019d move my things around and lose things, if I was running late for school you can bet she\u2019d have \u201cborrowed\u201d my math textbook the night before and now doesn\u2019t remember where she left it. As a teenager going through puberty, and menstruation, and raging hormones my patience for minor inconvenience was almost non-existent. Mind you I had lived with this sister since she was born. But despite being used to her, every year she grew into a brand new person and so did I, so it was really unrealistic to hope for a loving sisterly bond with that age difference.", "She just wants a sibling who she\u2019s reasonable close to. You can absolutely give that to her.\n\nMy sister and I have an 11 year gap but we\u2019ve still managed to be close. It was weird when I was 17/18 and she was 6/7, but spending time with her, playing with her, etc was enough for us to be closer as she\u2019s gotten older. It\u2019s relatively low effort for kids to like you as a sibling. Just be there and take some interest is all it takes", "Just keep repeating that she deserves to have lots of space for her own toys and she wouldn't be able to have sleepovers with her little friends if you were crammed into the same room. You have lots of homework to do and you need the space and quiet and don't want to disturb her when you creep into your room at night. You two will have wildly different bedtimes. \n\nKeep every argument positive and focussed on stepsisters welfare as ANY negativity will be pointed on by your FSM and used as evidence against you. Unfortunately your dad will not support you while he's wanting to please his fiance. Offer to have special time with her and even the occasional sleepover but it's best for your relationship if you have your own sleeping spaces.", "Exactly, she should not have been pushed until that was said.  I think Step-mom wants a baby sitter.", "That\u2019s why I think her dad is the asshole. She should never have been asked the question.", "I disagree with your disagreement.\n\nEveryone is now hurt because things were said (I don\u2019t have a desire for more siblings) that should never have been said.\n\nThe dad should have shut all conversations down once his daughter said no.\n\nHave a nice day!", "Exactly why her dad is the asshole.", "Asking her once would have been fine if every party involved immediately respected her no. That her stepmother didn't is entirely on her.", "It was a response to the mother trying to guilt trip her into sharing the bedroom, which was going back on an agreed arrangement. What do you expect a 15 year old to say in that case?", "You should change your vote to ESH", "No, I don\u2019t think I will.", "Then you don\u2019t understand the sub. If you think two people are assholes, then YTA is the wrong vote.", "NTA - Its not great for a 15 year old to share with a 7 year old.  I think this would be a bad idea even if they were sisters.  \n\nI think your future step mothers attitude is a red flag.  You aren't a babysitter and this is hardly likely to endear her daughter to you or her for that matter.", "NTA. when I was 15, I had to share a room with my 8/9 year old sister and it was honestly a nightmare lol. She wanted to be included when my friends were over which was impossible because of the huge age gap. Then it just made her feel bad. We had a terrible relationship for awhile\n\n\nEdit: the family is blending and the best way to do that is to respect boundaries. You two can bond plenty without sharing a room. Sharing a room will just end up in resentment especially when forced and one party doesn\u2019t even want to\n\n\nAlso I started sharing a room with my sister when I was 11, almost 12, and she had just turned 4\u2026.we shared until i was 16.

You are being honest and forthcoming and if they still want to push the issue that's on them, not you. \n\nAny why does your stepmother feel it's argument material with your father?

Not forcing it will definitely help since the goal seems to be pushing a close, sister relationship on OP.\n\nHell, if OP is open to it, maybe future step mom would back down a bit if they do little \u201csleepovers\u201d occasionally in the younger ones bedroom, but the kind where you don\u2019t sleep in the same room. Only if OP is open to it and actually wants to and it would have to be on OP\u2019s terms. The two of them sharing a room just wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for so many reasons and it\u2019s unfair to OP, especially since it seems like the younger step sister would be favored and that could lead to future step mom steamrolling. She seems like she would be given an inch and take a mile.\n\nActually OP may not want to offer a compromise even if she\u2019s open to it, sticking to a hard boundary is probably the better option. I hope once this gets sorted out between them that OP keeps anything that she doesn\u2019t want the little sister getting into up high and probably out of sight. She should definitely ask her dad to make sure her bedroom door has a lock and that he makes sure to lay out the boundaries as his for his fianc\u00e9e and her family rather than only as OP\u2019s boundaries.", "The fact that she was born doesn\u2019t entitle her to her own room.
