I work for a youth organization that has these items available, and kids have to get special permission from the school to wear them.

You corrected the error, but I'd also follow up with the school and the person who administers the service program.\n\nAt my senior honors night, the teacher making the announcements only listed one award for me. I knew I was receiving more than that, so I spoke up and said that was wrong. I had received a fullride+ scholarship and it was not mentioned. After a bit of back and forth, he finally realized he had only read the 2ND page of my awards list. He actually had gone on to another student before finally figuring out my pages had stuck together. Once he looked at the page, my scholarship was first thing listed. I had gotten more awards than even I was aware of. This isn't really a brag (I was an extreme overachiever), but some of the awards were to be announced at the honors night.\n\nOP, I'm glad you spoke up.

Switching to a medal instead of a cord happens; when I graduated HS every student had a shawl? Shoulder sash? to wear.

And are you telling her it's not the same cord, especially if it might get her in trouble?", "NTA but it is going to be akward when she was at graduation and is the only person wearing a cord.  They obviosly changed the award in the last 4 years.  Schools change awards and ceremonies all the time.  You really should have asked when turning in the paperwork.", "Buy 7 to send a message", "To add to my post, I feel like OP and everyone is also missing the bigger picture here...volunteer hours go on your high school transcript and are something a lot of colleges look at, not to mention something that can make or break a scholarship. I would be on the phone with the school, verifying how many hours are really on file.", "NTA good job mama!", "NTA - what a horrible way for her school to diminish her achievements and generosity of spirit. She should absolutely be celebrated, and you deserve a best mom award for picking up the slack from the school letting her down.", "NTA You bought something to make your kid happy.", "YTA. No one received cords. The school switched to medals. Getting an award should not be the motivation for volunteer work, and certainly being upset because the award is not the type you want needs some reframing for both you and your daughter.", "NTA op. If anything the school is. One for the hours, and two, from what is mentioned in the comments, for only giving a medal when traditionally honors get the cord and making the honor students BUY their cords just screams of the school wanting to make a quick buck.", "You have to be leaving something out.  Did the service hours truly count?  Like where they with an organization that the school recognizes or \u201cmy mom kept track of my hours\u201d?  Schools love to give out awards so there is something missing in this story.", "NTA Good job parenting the child and not enforcing the bureaucracy.", "Info: you looked up the colors and bought the cord. The cord that is no longer being given for such, what is this cord that you purchased being given for?\nYour daughter should be able to wear her medal on her robe and be recognized for what it symbolizes. Wearing a cord that others are wearing symbolizing a different recognition seems wrong as your daughter did not earn that recognition. Ywbta if that\u2019s the case.", "NTA. Man I wish my problems were this insignificant. You did the right thing, if anyone has a problem with it, it\u2019s only for one night so who cares", "NTA, but I would also offer to buy one for the other student who met the 200 hour goal.", "Did They give cords to those with 200+ hours? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf so then NTA", "YTA for buying the cord.\n\nIt's too bad that the cord she spent years volunteering to earn has been changed to a medal. But it has been. And if you both decide to go ahead and buy/wear the cord at graduation, you are awarding her a recognition that was not granted by the school, and should the color silver have been designated for other recognition (a quick google says it's also for recognition of individual accomplishments and Salutatorian) then she is potentially usurping some of the 'glory' from the folks who were intended to be recognized.\n\nIt also might be a good time to discuss the nature of volunteering vs. paid work, as she was clearly volunteering mainly to earn this recognition, which is not really in the spirit of volunteering.", "NTA they did mess up not acknowledging her hours properly, and they should give her the correct medal, if they did not.  \n\nThe cord is a separate issue - if it's ok for students to add stuff to their cap and gown for the ceremony, then it's fine.  If not, save it for her photos afterwards.  The school stopped giving them out, which is a shame if it's something she's looked forward to, but they didn't mess up by not giving her one if they aren't giving them out at all anymore.", "NTA The same thing happened to me in high school.", "You should do volunteer work for anything but pride IMO", "Check out the OP's other comments.  Two things happened:  \n\n\n1. The school did mess up on crediting her with the proper hours.  This definitely does need to be fixed.\n2. The school previously stopped giving out Tassels and switched to medals.  This may have been announced earlier this year, or any time in the past 4+ years.  The OP and her daughter somehow never checked if the tassel tradition still existed, and were blindsided by getting a medal instead.", "Exactly, this doesn't make sense.", "This is exactly what several others have asked and there is still no answer.", "She volunteered at a separate hospital than I am employed for. Someone else verified her hours electronically and I was in no way involved in those hours. They did give special awards of some kind to the 3 students they announced with less hours than her and I am still unsure why she was not included with that group. However at this point, all the school has commented on was that A) they are giving medals and B) here is the link you needed to fill out (which we had done). Neither of those things seem to be changing on their end so I purchased a cord for her myself", "That is such garbage.   \n\nAnd honestly reading stories like that (I\u2019ve heard others too) discourages kids from even trying for that level of commitment.   \n\nWhy even bother?    It doesn\u2019t even matter.   \n\nYou could have had birthdays off school eating ice cream at the mall, like my parents did with me.", "NTA tell her to wear it with pride!", "5+ years ago, they told the kids, who were in middle school, that they would get a \"tassel\" if they completed a certain amount of community service during high school. Since then, the policy has been revised, and the kids get a medal *instead of* the tassel.\n\nSo *currently* they *do not give tassels for community service*. They give *MEDALS* instead.", "Is a tassel considered *better* than a medal? If I had gotten a medal instead of a tassel for my service hours, I'd have been stoked!", "> She did the hours, she wears the cords.\n\nShe did the hours, *so she got a medal*, like all the *other* kids who completed the community service/volunteer hours. *NOBODY* got a tassel. They *all* got medals.", "She earned a medal. They changed the \"reward\" since she attended middle school. NOBODY gets a tassel, they all get a medal now.", "She's autonomous, and her mom clearly cares enough to pay attention to what is important to her.", "OP seems to have been saying they do not give *TASSELS* for community service. they have discontinued that practice, and are awarding medals instead.", "It seems \"the recognition she deserved\" *WAS* a medal. The school does not *DO* tassels for community service/volunteers anymore, \"just\" a medal. They need to correct her hours, but that has no bearing on the tassel.", "...to get a MEDAL. The school *gave* her a medal. They gave *all* the kids who volunteered medals. NOBODY got a tassel. They don't do that anymore.", ">  I don't understand is why, if she had that many hours, she was lumped in the category with 20-99? \n\nThis needs to be addressed. The school may have refused to count some of the hours, perhaps the ones where the \"certifying signature\" was that of a family member?\n\n> Did the other students who had more hours not receive cords when they were called up?\n\nThey did not. The school has replaced the tassels with medals. OP's kid got the medal.", "Looking forward to the update", "Why? Does it change the outcome?\n\nSeriously, you're allowed to feel good about helping others and to want to be recognized for your efforts. If someone is doing the right thing because they like the way it makes them feel, who are you to condemn that?", "Is there any greater pleasure for a high schooler than to force the school admin to admit they were wrong?\n\nThe theater group at my HS was barely tolerated while sports were lionized. By the time we were heading to my class\u2019s graduation, I had been in every play for three years and had racked up enough points for a letter.\n\nForcing them to admit that this meant I had earned a drama letter and thus the right to buy a letterman jacket was a nice piece of arm twisting, but I prevailed. Spent way too much on the jacket and a custom letter, wore it once to prove my point, and threw it in a box to be disposed of later.", " I know you're a busy working parent but if it were me I'd raise hell.", "It does if the school \"lost \" the records to make the one  200+ hours person look better. It would suck but now the burden of proof falls on op.", "The kid should wear the medal. When I graduated with my master\u2019s I wore both medals and all 4 cords. She should wear it proudly!", "I\u2019m in the US and both are interchangeable in my area. \n\n\nI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s kinda like how a \u201ccoke\u201d gets you Coca-cola but usually never Pepsi here whereas I\u2019ve heard some parts they use coke for both.", "I totally get the feeling associated with their screwing up honoring and recognizing the true amount of work she put in.  That sucks, and it would have for any kid. And I don\u2019t know why a medal is viewed as so much less than by you or her - that\u2019s what your question was about, and I\u2019m not trying to minimize the hurt and disappointment over the ceremony.  I just think you both are way too focused on this cord versus the medal.", "I still don't see where you answered if the other kids that were called up at the ceremony received cords or not. Did anybody get a cord?", "I wonder if maybe they discontinued this tradition in recent years then", "What about *last* year? Is this the *FIRST* year they have not given tassels?", "That makes sense. I guess I was confused also about the number of hours mistake. I wasn't sure if she got a medal because they thought she only volunteered 99 hours or less. But the ones they recognized for over that only got medals too?", "I'd have rather had a medal, to be honest.", "Were you  the person who signed off on *ANY* of her hours? Is it possible that they refused to count the hours for which a family member certified?", "She got the award. It just was not a tassel. NOBODY got a tassel. OP's daughter got the medal to show she did the service hours. OP should check to see why they refused some of her hours.", "[removed]", "   The school is probably being an AH because they don't want to be called out for messing up and don't want to do any work even though they are the ones at fault.", "Yep.\n\nIt's all well and good to say the school shouldn't have any control over it, but you can't just have kids claim it willy-nilly; some will just make it up. There has to be a means of tracking, and it sounds like a mistake was made there, so that's where to look.", "There is no difference. I have a pretty intensive volunteer position, and I refer to it as service, community service, and volunteering interchangeably.", "That's hilarious. My friend got all of her hours for a civic engagement requirement by going for the March for Life in Washington and getting stuck on the way home. Felt morally iffy to me at the time.", "Yes, thank you. Someone else had already explained.", "It sounds like they've switched to medals for all volunteer awardees.", "The...bank?", "I think you are replying to the wrong post?", "It could be as simple as not submitting the volunteer hours to the school. I know my high school you had to submit a signed form for the hours to count. \n\nIf OPs daughter was volunteering every weekend but never submitted her hours, that would be the simplest explanation.", "But you said your daughter's hours were not court ordered, so I still don't understand what the difference is.", "I got that , but did the person that did get called for over 200 get a cord", "I think they meant to comment on another post on AITA about Bank fraud", "Might just be a shitty bot?", "She actually volunteered at a separate hospital I was not a nurse for. I\u2019m not sure they even know my profession", "This.\n\nAnd OP, you're not an asshole for buying her a cord, as long as you're aware they might not let her wear it at commencement because no one else will be. It will be a sweet keepsake for her though.\n\n(It also might be that they don't care. Some schools let you go ham on decorating your graduation cap.)", "I suspect OP is beginning to realize the medals were awarded in lieu of tassels, and that their daughter got what she was supposed to (in terms of the \"award\") although they clearly miscounted her hours.", "Yes, this comment was copied word for word from a comment on that post", "Why would they assume that?", "Ok thanks, that\u2019s sort of what I was understanding, I\u2019d make sure the hours were updated and I guess if a cord is that important to both of them then wear it. Kids do wear medals though"]}
