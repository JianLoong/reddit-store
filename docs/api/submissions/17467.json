When she was in middle school, it was mentioned that she would receive a special \u201ctassel\u201d (that\u2019s what they called it) to wear at graduation if she completed 200 hours of volunteer work during her HS years. For whatever reason, she was really excited about this tassel and talked about it for the rest of the school year. Another mother confirmed that it was an actual thing as her son had received one. \n\nMy daughter completed 270+ hours before her senior year and applied for the award when the school announced it. Yesterday was the award ceremony for seniors by invitation only, and she received a letter and I RSVP confirming it was for her volunteer hours. I am an OR nurse (only relevant because of the hoops I had to jump through to get off in time to attend). We sat through 2 hours of awards (congrats to those seniors as well), as the volunteer award was very last on the list. \nThey started by announcing students who had completed 100-150 hours and two students were called. Then they announced students who received 200 or more hours and one student was called\u2026not my daughter. The very last award was a collection of students who had completed between 20-99 hours and they listed all of them and made us wait to clap at the end as there were so many. She was lumped into that group. She received a medal that says \u201cservice award\u201d. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. After she only received a medal, which she will obviously not wear with her cap and gown, I went online, googled what color cord is for volunteers, and bought her one to wear. This is all she talked about for 5 years.\n\nI did email the school and they claimed \u201cthey do not give out cords for community service and did she not receive a medal last night\u201d. I also asked for clarification on why she was not included in the 200+ category, none of which really changed the outcome from last night. \n\nAITA for buying her a cord the school did not give her during awards?", "created_utc": 1684324997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jzrpq/aita_for_buying_my_daughter_an_honor_cord_she_was/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There must be other kids affected too.\n\nI wonder if the school are confusing the two types of community service: (1) voluntary and (2) *court-ordered* (because someone broke the law). I wonder if that's why the school doesn't recognise it \u2014 a typical blind rule with no intelligent considerationn of context.", "INFO: Have you talked to the school as to WHY she was not credited with all of her volunteer hours?", "NTA - The administration clearly has some issues. Points to you for supporting and standing up for your daughter.", "INFO: were the other kids who did 100+ or 200+ hours actually given cords at the ceremony? Or a tassel (that is a different thing). Or were they just recognized separately? \n\nA lot of schools don\u2019t allow kids to just wear any cords/tassels they can find and buy. I work for a youth organization that has these items available, and kids have to get special permission from the school to wear them. Some schools don\u2019t do any at all, some do only academic ones. It may be that no students are allowed to wear cords for volunteer hours.

Also, community service is service to your community. Which is volunteer work. I\u2019m assuming compulsory community service would not be applicable. This is all very confusing.... \n\nNTA \u2014 she did her service to her community, she should receive the recognition.

After she only received a medal, which she will obviously not wear with her cap and gown\n\nWhy not?  She earned it more than anyone else it sounds like.\n\nReminds me of when I graduated high school.  From K-12, I didn't miss a single day.  I'm not talking \"no unexcused absences\", I mean literally didn't miss a day of school.  \n\nWhen it came time for awards at the end of my senior year, I got no recognition for it.  Zero.  The next best student was a \"perfect\" attendance that included excused absences (they clarified that).  \n\nI asked the school about it, and they said there was no way I never missed a day, and they wouldn't be looking into.  Fucking furious about that even now, 20 years later.", "NTA, But she can absolutely wear the medal over her robes. My high school did IB (kind of like AP but recognized internationally and if you take enough of the classes + do a bunch of other stuff, you get a special diploma), and IB does medals, not cords. People who got the medals absolutely wore them in the ceremony", "NTA\n\nThis is totally the schools fault. I believe credit is where credit is due. And she totally deserves credit for all the work she did. I think it's kind of sweet you would get her the tassel any way. The school is probably being an AH  because they don't want to be called out for messing up and don't want to do any work even though they are the ones at fault.", "Is the person who did get acknowledged for over 200 wearing a chord or did they get a medal?", "NTA -- does your school know who your daughter is? I don't mean that to be facile: first they thought she was doing court-ordered community service, then they said she didn't receive a medal that she received. Are they mistaking her for someone else?", "NTA. You corrected the error, but I'd also follow up with the school and the person who administers the service program.\n\nAt my senior honors night, the teacher making the announcements only listed one award for me. I knew I was receiving more than that, so I spoke up and said that was wrong. I had received a fullride+ scholarship and it was not mentioned. After a bit of back and forth, he finally realized he had only read the 2ND page of my awards list. He actually had gone on to another student before finally figuring out my pages had stuck together. Once he looked at the page, my scholarship was first thing listed. I had gotten more awards than even I was aware of. This isn't really a brag (I was an extreme overachiever), but some of the awards were to be announced at the honors night.\n\nOP, I'm glad you spoke up. I had the confidence and independence, knowing I could only rely on myself to advocate in my interest. It's a bummer that your daughter wasn't recognized publicly, but it better be corrected by the school.\n\nETA: didn't catch that the school doesn't give out cords and only the medal that all received. It's shaky, but I don't think it's really an issue. You do need to follow up and make sure she's being recorded as having earned the 200+ honor.", "Very torn on judgement.  From your comments it appears that the cords are not handed out at all anymore for community service/volunteering, and at some point it was switched to medals.  I am leaning towards that making you T A for buying your daughter a cord that has no significance for the school anymore, but at the same time, I\u2019m not sure it actually matters if it\u2019s truly that important to her. I think if your daughter did all the work for a cord then maybe her priorities are wrong, and you should work with her to reframe why she should volunteer (not for recognition)\n\n The school certainly sucks for misrepresenting your daughters achievements at the ceremony and should apologize to her.", "NTA \n\n\nWhy wouldn't and shouldn't community count?\n\nWeird school policy", "INFO: I think you\u2019re leaving some part of the story out.  Why did they award other kids but not your daughter? Was there a technicality? Did she volunteer with you, and they doubt the truth of her hours?", "INFO: volunteer work and community service are interchangeable terms in all the places in the USA I have lived. Are you sure that isn\u2019t the case here? Could the school saying they don\u2019t give out cords to any of the volunteer award recipients, only medals? (I did a lot of community service in high school, college, and volunteer organizing, I have never taken community service to mean only court ordered hours.  Even in law school we called it community service.)", "NTA but it may have required more clarification that it was voluntary community service as it sounds like they assumed it was court-ordered as a result of an arrest or something.", "NTA\n\nShe was promised it, she worked hard for it. Not your fault the school is run by idiots", "It\u2019s a cord, and only imbued with as much importance as you give it.
