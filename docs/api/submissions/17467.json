I work for a youth organization that has these items available, and kids have to get special permission from the school to wear them.

You corrected the error, but I'd also follow up with the school and the person who administers the service program.\n\nAt my senior honors night, the teacher making the announcements only listed one award for me. I knew I was receiving more than that, so I spoke up and said that was wrong. I had received a fullride+ scholarship and it was not mentioned. After a bit of back and forth, he finally realized he had only read the 2ND page of my awards list. He actually had gone on to another student before finally figuring out my pages had stuck together. Once he looked at the page, my scholarship was first thing listed. I had gotten more awards than even I was aware of.

Switching to a medal instead of a cord happens; when I graduated HS every student had a shawl? Shoulder sash? to wear.

I think it seems the school just no longer uses cords for this honor, and the fact that she was told this in middle school is telling that the regalia has changed. She got a medal, she got honored (for the wrong amount of hours, I know, hopefully that can get corrected). Does it really matter that it\u2019s not a cord? That part of this scenario sounds like you\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. I don\u2019t see how she can\u2019t wear the medal a graduation, even with your explanation.

One seems just as good as the other. I'm not sure why there is such significance in a cord specifically. \n\nI say it's only a soft YTA because clearly this meant a lot to your daughter and it must have been very painful watching her be disappointed.

The most important info would be: What customizations are allowed on gowns and caps during the ceremony. OP is certainly not an asshole for celebrating the accomplishment with the daughter in the way the daughter expected.\n\nYou seem to think that because the school gave the kid a medal (and messed up the rewards ceremony) the parent shouldn't be buying the thing they both expected? I firmly disagree and will state again: The only way this becomes asshole behavior on part of the parent is if the dress code prohibits such customizations AND the parent encourages the child to wear it....\n\nYou're making a big deal out of something you can get for $1.20...\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/GRADFTY-Pieces-Graduation-Tassels-Ceremony/dp/B0BH9CYL19", "You seem really invested in the virtues of this medal... you also seem REALLY obsessed with what OTHER people will think about either.", "Who told her this when she was in middle school?", "You don't need a meeting, you need to call the school office and ask to speak to the relevant principal/dean/administrator. \"Didn't she get a medal?\" sounds like the woman you emailed doesn't understand that the problem is *the hours were wrong,* probably because you are so laser-focused on the cord. Call them, explain that your daughter had over 200 hours but was not recognized for them, and only *after* that is sorted out should you ask whether 200+ hours gets a cord or if you were misinformed.", "Ok", "For the duration of her daughter's entire high school experience, OP cannot confirm that cords were distributed. This is not a miscommunication on the school's part, this is an oversight on OP and her daughter's part. And it doesn't make them an asshole for not keeping up to date on regalia policy. It just makes her a little entitled to A) allege that the school commited a wrongdoing and deprived her daughter of a cord, and B) not simply help her daughter come to terms with the medal. To your point, at the age of 17, can't she as a parent help her daughter understand that this happens, and she got her hopes up for something that wasn't guaranteed? It seems like *OP* was making a big deal out of something she misunderstood, and is now acting righteous. \n\nYeah, her daughter can sport the $1.20 cord (which would literally make me feel worse, knowing that I didn't earn it but felt the need to pay a buck for it). But personally, I would prefer if my mother had leveled with me and helped me feel proud of my medal. OP's attitude almost reinforces the idea that medal < cord, and that her daughter shouldn't wear the medal with pride.\n\nI honestly wouldn't call her an asshole but like, I don't think this was the best course of action.", "The school", "NTA. It's really bogus that they're claiming they don't offer cords for volunteer service, she deserves to be acknowledged for her efforts. Not a lot of people care about stuff like that, so kudos to you for raising such a kind member of society.\n\nTo be honest, the school will probably not even notice the extra cord if no one mentions it to them. And even if they do, what'll they do? Fail her? Her grades are already final. Give her detention? Suspend her? She's literally graduating. Their hands are tied. You both collectively should do what you feel most comfortable with to honor her hard work. \n\nCongraduation!", "YTA for continuously stating that your daughter earned something that no longer exists. She did earn a medal and that is great. She did not earn a cord because that is not something awarded for service at her school. The fixation on the prize being a cord is bizarre. Also, your insistence that a medal cannot be worn at graduation is ridiculous.", "Esh. Volunteer work should be abt the work, not abt an award. You deminished the value of the award she was given (even if it wasn't what she wanted). You really don't say if the other Volunteers received tassels or a medal (assuming it was a medal since you arent flipping on them to give her what she earned). I get being a little disappointed but buying her a tassel & expecting others to honor/respect it just because she didnt like the medal is odd. Every parent can buy tassels & add but is it reasonable or fair? You should have made the school hold up their end if you feel so strongly", "YTA. Do not let her show up to graduation with the cord you bought. She is going to be questioned about it and she will be embarrassed in front of her class when she is forced to remove it. This is a learning experience and tell her that she can work towards one during her college time (although that would be for academics). But most definitely get her volunteer hours worked out with the school. That's important for college.\n\nI feel for you and her but a medal should be worn proudly too. Also, mom, buy her some roses for immediately after the ceremony and let her know how proud you are of her.", " NTA and once again, I lose respect for school admins.", "NTA", "I'll be honest, sorting through this was confusing. Because it seems like 2 things are going on if I understand correctly:\n\n\\*There was an error in recognizing the # of hours your daughter completed and she was not called at the appropriate time in the ceremony\n\n\\*The way they recognize students shifted from a metal to a cord.\n\nIt is disappointing that your daughter wasn't accurately recognized during the ceremony and if any further communications go out that acknowledge awards (i.e. school newsletter, graduation program that absolutely should be fixed and if a different metal is given for over 200 vs. 20-99 that should be corrected.\n\nThe tassel/cord changing to metal...honestly I can see why they might not have communicated that to parents/students. While it sounds like it was incredibly important to your daughter and her motivating force to reach this # of hours, the school may not have considered that one would mean that much more to students than others. Honestly with all that schools have had to deal with in the last few years I think it's justified that communicating this wasn't a top priority. And I say this as someone who was super into volunteering in high school and got a president's service award and a prudential award for service. I think I might have gotten a plaque or metal or something for some of those but I don't really remember caring that might about that stuff. For me it was more that I cared about the causes I volunteered for and it helped me to build my activities resume for college. I don't say that to imply your daughter *shouldn't* care about the cord, more that it's possible that medal vs. cord isn't a big thing generally to other students and parents and therefore the school didn't think to communicate it.\n\nBut I don't think buying the cord makes you an asshole either. there was definitely a point in middle school or high school where I was bummed I didn't get anything for honor roll so my parents got me a trophy made from some trophy shop. So I get it.\n\nThat said, I would look into what policies the school has around wearing things at graduation other than the standard gown, mortarboard, tassel. I don't know that I'd have her wear it at graduation since it just seems like it's asking for more drama. But if it means that much to her I don't see the harm in taking pictures of her in her gown and mortarboard at home wearing it.", "NTA. Horrible that your daughter did way above the requirements. I know its about the experience itself, but that she was overlooked somehow is insulting.", "NTA", "That poor child. Buy her the cord but throw in a pony too.  \ud83d\ude1e", "Okay after reading the comments...\n\nNTA. But since they don't do tassels anymore, your daughter may not be allowed to walk if she wears one. Maybe you can turn it into a bracelet or necklace instead?\n\nIt's funny the things we get fixated on when we're younger. I remember having some of the oddest things just stick in my mind. But at least her fixation let her do some good in the world.", "NTA - the one student who was called for their 200+ hours, did they receive a cord? Or a medal? \n\nEither way they should be figuring this out and giving your daughter her cord. You can\u2019t dangle something in front of children encouraging them to do better and then not set an example by following through and doing better. They can do better than this.", "NTA and someone at the school rigged it.  \nQuestion: Who won it?", "This. OP, if this happened to your daughter, it 100% happened to other kids, too. Honestly? THis is where you go full bore to get the situation dealt with immediately and if you need to invoke social media you do so. 270 hours of community service is a significant contribution and to be knocked down to the group receivinga medal for 20 hours of community service would just flat out be insulting. \n\ndefinitely NTA.\n\nThose tassles are important. They are a public acknowledgement of the hard work a kid does to earn them.", "Well she said it was ugly, does she need to wear it now? Is her opinion on the medal ok or is it just being assumed it\u2019s my opinion on the medal. If she wanted to wear it: cool.", "There are 506 comments in this post. I assure you, I\u2019ve answered that exact response at least 8 times in the 506 posts this has. She earned it. She isn\u2019t trying to \u201csteal it\u201d from someone who \u201cactually won\u201d. It wasn\u2019t a one prize award.", "Do you know what volunteering is? It's quite literally unpaid labor and often of the kind that you'd have trouble finding people for due to it being dirty, tedious or time consuming.\n\n\n\n\nAt my state's minimum wage rate OPs kid provided over $3500 in free labor. Frankly, who gives a shit if they did it for colored rope, for status, as a graduation requirement or out of the kindness of their heart? That's still 200+ hours that a charitable organization got for free.\n\n\n\n\nLet me reframe it for you; donations to charity are tax deductible, if you donated $3500 to a charity and they just never gave you the paperwork for the tax reduction or the sweatshirt you get for donating $3500 would you say it's wrong to complain because you should just be happy you gave $3500 to a good cause?\n\n\n\n\nI graduated high school with over 300 volunteer hours between my city's volunteer fire brigade and a few other extracurriculars I did for 4 years.\n\n\n\n\nI'll let you in on a little secret, while I liked helping people I was much more interested in riding firetrucks and the boost that having such a unique leadership role would have on my college applications.\n\n\n\n\nNow, I'm fairly sure the couple who's house I helped save, the old lady who I comforted after a drunk driver totaled her car, the family who's pets and kids I looked after as we were tearing their house down to save it, and my fellow crew members couldn't care less that I was there mainly to build my resume over a fully selfless desire to help my fellow citizens.\n\n\n\n\nIf people do good things for the wrong reason, does that negate the good they did? Would the world be better off if they never acted in the first place because their motivations were impure?", "I think the school should definitely correct their error, but this seems like more of an issue for the administrative office vs. the school board. From what the OP has written it sounds like it was an issue of a clerical error and IDK escalating that all the way to the school board seems a bit much. But at least where I am at the school board usually hears bigger issues.", "Confirmed medal in another comment - cords aren\u2019t given out for community service anymore at the school", "So you honestly don't know if she would've received a cord even if they had her hours recorded correctly? You can have your camera ready and still pay attention to what else is happening on the stage.", "So even the students who volunteered 200 or 2000 hours got a medal? Cords were for entirely different things??", "The school is the one who said it. That\u2019s not \u201crandomly heard\u201d. The confirmation was from another parent. The INITIAL hearing of this award was the school. I am also in no way freaking out. You all act like I am yelling at the school demanding they do something at once and get her a tassel. What actually happened was \u201coh a medal, I thought it was supposed to be a tassel\u201d Well I can order you a tassel to wear. I should email the school about that though. It was weird you weren\u2019t included in the large hours part\u201d. My own motherly struggle making my anxious daughter sit there and fidget for two hours to be lumped together and not actually recognized for a goal she set as an 8th grader was not some rage rant when they were finished. This is literally not my first day at hiding my anxiety for her from her. I\u2019m not an idiot, I\u2019m not throwing fits in front of people and complaining. I asked if I was wrong to buy her a tassel she earned. The end. You guys are putting way too much soap opera tv drama into this.", "I\u2019m gonna say soft YTA. You are right to get the school to put her in the correct category of 200 volunteer hours, they should put her in the correct category. But I think buying her a separate cord is wrong if the school discontinued the cords in general for volunteering. I feel like you\u2019re handling this part of it wrong; this could be a teachable moment for your daughter that traditions change and that sometimes the way schools recognize or honor students differs from year to year, in this case she got a medal instead of the cord that was given in the past. And idk if the school will allow her to wear the cord.", "Hey dummy! If you don\u2019t care stop replying!!! Delete your account and live your life", "Ok", "Ok so..you don\u2019t think maybe I sent a follow up saying \u201cok fine it\u2019s a medal but why wasn\u2019t she included in the 200+ hours section\u201d?
