I work for a youth organization that has these items available, and kids have to get special permission from the school to wear them.

You corrected the error, but I'd also follow up with the school and the person who administers the service program.\n\nAt my senior honors night, the teacher making the announcements only listed one award for me. I knew I was receiving more than that, so I spoke up and said that was wrong. I had received a fullride+ scholarship and it was not mentioned. After a bit of back and forth, he finally realized he had only read the 2ND page of my awards list. He actually had gone on to another student before finally figuring out my pages had stuck together. Once he looked at the page, my scholarship was first thing listed. I had gotten more awards than even I was aware of.

Switching to a medal instead of a cord happens; when I graduated HS every student had a shawl? Shoulder sash? to wear.

You can draw whatever conclusions you want to about someone\u2019s motivation for doing it, but the point is community service and volunteer work are the SAME THING. She did more hours than all the other students who received tassels \u2026 why aren\u2019t you questioning their motivations??", "Look better for who? Colleges? If they\u2019re graduating they already are locked in to the college they\u2019re going to and being the sole person of this award would have no bearing on that\n\nLook better for the parents? Why would the school care? The school would look better if more people had more logged hours\n\nSeems like a weird conspiracy to float\n\nI get the sense there is stuff missing from OP\u2019s post as well but this is also so low stakes\u2026just wear the cord would anyone even notice anyway", "There's a possibility they did some shady business to favor one student, yes.\n\nIt's also possible daughter forgot a form, or that someone at the school accidentally lost a form, or that some of her service didn't qualify for some reason. There's no way for us to know unless OP finds out.", "Yeah, I'm confused why they wouldn't be wearing the medals at graduation.", "It\u2019s a pdf file of all her logged hours. It\u2019s not a typed out email where they could have mistyped the amount of hours.", "I don\u2019t know what they handed out. I had my camera ready to record the podium when they called her name. The person handing awards was not close enough for me to watch both my screen of making announcements and handing out awards. When he only called the one name at 200+ and it was not her, I didn\u2019t see what they handed that student as I looked at her and her reaction instinctively. When I emailed asking for clarification all the lady was focused on was \u201cdidn\u2019t she get a medal and there was a form\u201d which again we had filled out.", "I do not know if the three individuals who had 100+ hours got a cord or a metal as I had my camera ready to record because I thought her name would be called. I was focused on the presenter calling names and not the person handing out cords versus metals. When the section they called her for was brought up, all of those kids got medals.", "I know a kid that is full ride scholarship to a top US univ based off volunteering.", "She\u2019s my only child. I\u2019ve never attended senior awards at this school until this year", "NOBODY GOT TASSELS! The school *switched to medals*!", "I was not. It was sent from the hospital office. My name or signature is not on that in any way", "Recognized in what way? The awards were yesterday. They aren\u2019t going to redo them again and be like \u201cmy bad she actually had the most\u201d. If my daughter were made about the cord I wouldn\u2019t have ordered it. The question is more toward being an asshole for sending her to graduation with an award they didn\u2019t \u201cgive her\u201d.", "So you need to get the school to acknowledge the correct number of hours... but they do not owe her a cord/tassel, since they have changed the \"reward\" to a medal, which she got.", "Anyone at the entire award ceremony? Yes. ONLY the very last category of volunteers they called as a group got a medal.", "The volunteer category all got medals. People getting awards for different things (presumably academic, etc.) got cords. But every student being recognized as a volunteer got a medal. For whatever reason, they've decided to do medals now for that category. Why? I don't know. Maybe they ran out of cords. Maybe they found a medal design they really liked. It could be anything. But that whole category got medals.", "Same, but if it makes them both happy and the school doesn\u2019t care, then wear it? Honestly I only looked at my own kids close enough to notice that stuff lol", "I swear they hammer the students about responsibility but if they fuck up\u2026.straight crickets from front row to the balcony. It was one of the reasons I graduated early.", "That's actually a really happy ending, with *nice* students, for once.", "Seems like you were implying that you are also outraged daughter didn't get a \"rope\" for her \"efforts\". My reply is that it's friggin volunteer work! why do you need recognition or a tassel to stroke your ego?", "Can you detail what service she did? Also were these hours signed off on by a 3rd party or only you?\n\nSince you work at the hospital they may take your word alone as a conflict of interest. \n\nEdit: Nevermind you mentioned that the school switched to medals for volunteer awards. Your daughter didn't get a cord because they stopped giving out cords for volunteer service.", "So, this is what you need to call the school about. A) They got her hours wrong and B) She was told there would be a tassel. So, why didn\u2019t she receive one?", "Where I live, there is a very popular scholarship that is awarded to kids having 250 service hours, along with a certain GPA and a certain SAT score. But if you don't have the hours, you're out. That's a big deal.", "So you are getting yourself upset over a policy change. Your kid got the same \"award\" the other kids got. She was not slighted. She *WAS* shorted most of her hours, and I'd recommend making an appointment with a guidance/career counselor at the school to get that sorted. NOBODY got a tassel. It was not JUST your child. The kids ALL got medals. You can buy your kid a tassel of any sort you like, but it isn't appropriate to wear it at graduation, as it signifies NOTHING in the context of your school's award scheme.", "So did anyone get a cord this year", "So what is the difference between volunteer hours and other things that kids would have gotten a cord?   Was the cord for academic?  If that is the case, then no you shouldn\u2019t have bought her a cord as she got a medal.  I do not understand why she would have only been listed as 20 hours when you say she did 200.  \nPerhaps when she started they did give cords out for volunteer hours and she had that stuck in her head but they changed it?", "Okay because people are saying here that the policy got switched since middle school and no one got cords so I think people are confused.", "Yeah, i agree. I think its odd but it certainly doesn't harm anyone. I certainly wouldn't care if I saw the kid wearing it. I cant really say she is an AH for this. I mean if anything, I wish I had a mother that would go through the trouble to find the cord and buy it for me just to make me feel better.", "Sometimes kids get excited about things! She did the work.", "Because that was the requirement to get the tassel?", "It doesn't necessarily mean that in the US, either. You can certainly perform community service without being told to do so.", "The term the lady used is something someone else said was court ordered. All I was doing was explaining to someone else the difference between the two. Not saying that my kid had court ordered hours she was claiming", "I did not work as a nurse for this hospital, verify any of her hours myself, and she did not volunteer with me as I work in an OR and we do not allow volunteers there. She was there over two summers before Covid, and did volunteering at many of their different areas they offered volunteers for. Someone else sent them the hours, not me.", "Yup.", "Then she can wear it for HERSELF as the school gets nothing out of her wearing it either way.", "[I\u2019m thinking no.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amitheasshole/comments/13jzrpq/aita_for_buying_my_daughter_an_honor_cord_she_was/jkj3c9k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "Yes, it sounds like she got attached to the idea of the cord several years ago when it was a cord. Now it's a medal, and if she thought the cord was cooler, then it's a bummer but it's just life.", "Should be more excited that she got to help someone in need. If the record's set straight who gives a crap about a tassel. Materialistic much?", "Good to know that kids these days wouldn't do volunteer work unless they receive something in return", "That\u2019s exactly what I mean. I am in the US too. Community service does not imply court-ordered here. It implies doing a (unpaid) service for the community. From how OP writes, I feel like they are also from the US, so I\u2019m not sure why so many people seem to be jumping to \u201cwell you used the wrong term, that\u2019s why!\u201d", "Whatever the case. keep on the school to have the right info in her transcript for school. If she puts 200+hr on a college application and they check with the school, then the school says she did at least 20hr but not 200. The college might scrap her application completely.", "So then why didn\u2019t the school accept her hours for the purposes of the cord? I still don\u2019t get that.", "I\u2019m so confused. Instead of us all guessing, can you please clarify the reason that the school gave you for not counting her hours?? Was this a mistake on their end or did they have some weird qualification that was not originally communicated?", "How long has your daughter been in high school that she was able to do volunteer work for two years pre-COVID while in high school? That timeline doesn\u2019t make much sense", "Thanks for answering but you also said the school switched to medals for volunteer work in another comment.\n\nYour daughter would have never received a tassle in the first place even if her hours were correct. The school is the asshole for getting her hours wrong though.", "??? But it\u2019s the same issue. She wasn\u2019t recognized for her effort", "I mean she can...but she was properly awarded. It\u2019s sucks that she didn\u2019t know about the policy change, but she wasn\u2019t slighted by the school by not receiving a cord. Although they did miscount her hours. And I understand being upset about that. \n\nBut I think she\u2019s going to look pretty strange for wearing a cord for volunteer hours when no one else is. People will know. At our school all the cords were different colors, so if someone has an odd one it would\u2019ve been noticed.", "She can stencil Mickey Mouse on her robe too, but it is not *appropriate* to do so.", "It\u2019s not a crime to be excited about something. She probably IS happy that she got to help people in need, and also wanted to tassel as a reminder of all her hard work. \n\nSeriously, what crawled up your ass????", "Yea did you not read her post dude?", "This was exactly my comment. Making sure her hours are correct for the sake of college/scholarships is way more important than the silver cord.", "Because the school doesn\u2019t actually give out cords to anyone for this, only medals", "They didn\u2019t give me a reason. She sent me a link to a form we were supposed to fill out which we already did and didn\u2019t comment on her hours being misrepresented at all. They aren\u2019t going to redo the award ceremony and told me she should have gotten a medal so they are basically like \u201cthe end\u201d.", "The summer between middle school and 9th grade 2019 and the very beginning of 2020 before the hospital kicked our students. Not summer for the 2020 year but spring break. My bad on calling it \u201ctwo summers\u201d", "There was never any notice that \u201cwe now give medals\u201d. Not to be rude but if they would have said \u201cit\u2019s a medal now\u201d, I would have been like cool give it to her during school and i will get her a cord to wear. I would not have made sure I was off work, made her sit uncomfortably for 2 hours, and then been handed a medal at the very end in a rush to finish.", "She got the correct *AWARD*. Nothing would change there, whether she did 20 hours or 20k hours. the clerical issue of the *number* of hours needs to be resolved, but the \"recognition\" in the form of the medal, was received.", "Good idea. We should also do that.", "OP has actually replied in another comment that no, no students received cords at all. They all got medals. The school no longer gives out cords/tassels for volunteer hours.", "Why? What's the difference between what OPs daughter did, and volunteer work? That's what I don't get.", "Is \"she\" the person in charge of the volunteer program, or just a random person at the school who might not know the ins and outs of it?", "I really don\u2019t understand. You did talk to them afterwards and point out their mistake right? What did they say when you addressed it after the fact? If they are defending giving her a medal did they explain why?\n\nEither there is a reason she didn\u2019t get credit for all of her hours or they made a mistake. You\u2019re not being clear about which it was or what their explanation was.", "Depending on how many hours she did that first summer that could be where the counting discrepancy is coming from. Why would she get credit for hours she completed before she was enrolled in the school?", "No she did not. She got the lesser version. She was not publicly lauded for her accomplishment", "Turns out I didn\u2019t read!", "Nothing. She got the award for volunteer work. It's just a medal now instead of a cord. It's like if they used to give you a plaque for winning the spelling bee and now it's a trophy. You still won the spelling bee.", "From what I understand she was the person in charge of the senior awards night award part. Who actually checked the amounts or forms where we entered the hours \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I reached out to her because she is who I RSVP to and her reply was \u201cdid she not get a medal last night\u201d and \u201chere is the form you should have filled out\u201d which I had already done.", "She\u2019s automatically enrolled in the closest high school and already knew which one it is. We do not physically have to enroll her. Students HAVE to be entering high school the summer before they can start counting hours. The hospital can only take students who are \u201centering freshman year or are 15\u201d for age reasons. She was not allowed to apply in middle school, we asked and that was the reply.", "\"Lesser version\" of WHAT? \n\nNOBODY got the cord/tassel. They have changed the policy, so the \"award\" is now a medal instead, *which she got!* Everyone got the medal, not the tassel. Nobody got the tassel, it was not *only* OP's daughter that got a medal instead."]}
