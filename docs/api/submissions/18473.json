You earned it.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, Little Red Riding Hood couldn't tell the difference between her grandma and a wolf in a nightgown, so... you might actually be a bit closer to your grandparent than her.", "NTA. The guy disappears for fourteen years, pays for one class, and suddenly things he's Grandpa of the year and the only reason you're even going to college?\n\nPLEASE.", "NTA! Good for you for standing up for your parents YEARS of efforts for you, which absolutely had a much greater impact on your future than your grandpas money to take a course. And, also you should be proud of yourself, for not squandering others\u2019 investment in your future like so many others do. Congratulations, and have an amazing time in school :)", "Good for you. NTA Always stand up for yourself like this.", "Congratulations on your accomplishment! \n\nNTA. Your grandpa is taking full credit for something in which he played a small part. It's totally understandable that you'd want to set the record straight. It's also awesome that you're grateful for your parents' support! And also don't forget to claim some of that credit for yourself. You've worked hard for this! Enjoy it!", "Congratulations on your achievements. Your parents must be very proud of you.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. YOU got the 1450 on your own. I would have told you to apply for Ivy League with that score, and your class rank; you might have qualified for aid based on income. (Some Ivies are paying full if the family makes under 100k.)", "Slight AH. He did contribute, at least for the course that you took, so how difficult would it have been to allow him to brag a little to his buds. It hurt no one. You know the truth and that is what matters most.  One day you won\u2019t have him around to annoy you.", "NTA. You\u2019re a wise and intelligent person who sees things clearly and isn\u2019t down for BS. That\u2019s all.", "Anyone that starts a sentence with  \" I'm not ..  whatever\" is exactly that.

Go and conquer the academic world, and  know YNA.", "\nNta\nHe is not the reason you are going to school. YOU are the reason.

You were already heading to college on your own, through your hard work with your parents support.", "NTA\n\nYou and your parents did all the hard work! He paid for one SAT prep class. Also Congratulations! Super excited for you. You sound like you have a great head on your shoulders and I bet your parents are so proud!", "NTA - Let me explain exact why. By the time you retook the class your parents had already forged your character which includes your tenacity. Your grandfather may have paid for the course but to be honest with you, I think you would have made it in regardless. He's selfish and it is him being thr center of his own universe that has him thinking that one small act on his act makes a difference. Go be great young man and while you are away at college make sure you love people like your grandfather never could and that will be his legacy - that despite all attempts to suppress the good in you something greater prevailed.", "I would ask your parents to write him a check for the amount and hand it to him personally.", "NTA- It warms my heart to see the love & appreciation you have for your parents. But, you should be very proud of yourself too! With their support, YOU achieved wonderful things. Cheers to you & your amazing parents.", "NTA at all, and congrats on your success! Your grandpa's just trying to show off that he still has some family that relies on him, even though that's obvs not true. Good on you for calling him out.", "It never hurts to give credit where credit is due... and yes, saying your parents kept you on the educational path (you know gramps, your daughter and dad really helped me out) and I did get the good score that we knew would get me in  most colleges). \n\nBut gramps it was **your** help that really is gonna make a huge difference. Studying for the test and retaking it with a higher score was what gave me this unique and super opportunity! Your the man Gramps. You pitched the ball so I could hit a home run!\n\nThe truth, the whole truth, never hurts.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nIt reminds me of the bio mom who wanted to be added to the gift (a car) that would be given to her son between her stepmother and her father.\r  \n\r  \nYour grandfather did not give you the course, as support, narcissists give gifts to be able to adhere to your achievements, like leeches.", "The course wouldn't have done anything without OP's hard work.  It's not like you take the course and it's the same as getting 1500.  You still have to TAKE and SCORE WELL on the test.\n\nAnd nowhere in here did OP say that his parents couldn't have scraped up the money anyway. Or that OP wouldn't have been able to improve their score without it.", "I'm now imagining the little mermaid on the rock with some cash waves behind her.", "He deserves no credit for finally being present and supportive of his grandchild who he apparently didn't give a shit about until grandpa realized he was alone in the world. He rejected OP's father because he was black (because he's a big old racist) and rejected OP as well (because he's a big old racist). OP has every right to react the way they did and honestly until grandpa apologizes for his shameful behavior, he doesn't deserve any credit for anything.", "\"Yay for me, I did one thing!\"", "NTA \n\nIt was YOUR hard work not your grandpa and not your parents.

I'm so proud of you!!!!!!   \n\nHave a blast at college!   Studying is very important but so are the friends that you will make.", "NTA. So NTA. He's trying to steal your thunder and your parents thunder right now. It's nice that he helped out in the end but being #1 in your class plus your SAT of 1450 means you were going to be getting many offers for many schools already.", "NTA.  YOU did the work.", "NTA. As someone who\u2019s done a good amount of SAT tutoring, you don\u2019t need the expensive classes to improve on the SAT. Studying at home is pretty much just as effective: most students who improve at the SAT through classes could have improved by just doing practice tests, getting good sleep, and bringing a high protein snack to the exam. Paying for classes is for rich parents whose kids don\u2019t try even with the classes because they\u2019ve been coddled their whole lives. The only people I recommend take classes are those who can get them for free or have a poor home environment that makes it harder to focus. Your grandpa didn\u2019t get you the higher grade, YOU did.", "NTA", "NTA. You did the work. It wasn\u2019t like gramps asked admissions for a favor. He did pay for a review course, but those only smooth out some rough edges. \n\nCongrats! Hope it\u2019s everything you want.", "NTA. Congrats on your achievements and sticking up for yourself and parents!!  While it is nice to know that he finally came to his senses and stopped being an AH, he was wrong to suggest his paying for the test prep was the reason why you are going to the ivy. He rightfully should be proud but was out of line.", "Not only that, but if grandpa hadn\u2019t paid for the course, OP could have studied on their own using books from the library and free resources online, and likely would have still been able to improve their score enough to get into the school they\u2019re going to. Grandpa may have made things a little easier or faster, sure? But OP would have ended up exactly where they are now whether or not grandpa stepped in at all.", "And only for one tiny step of the journey at that!", "YTA\n\nYour grandfather was reaching out to you connecting to you by taking credit.  By correcting him the message was \"Too little, to late\".  If you are 17 it is not too early to recognize that this may be as close to an apology as he can muster.  You rejected his attempt to be close to you.  Congratulation.\n\nConsider how he feels rather than the accuracy of his statement.  He was proud of you and you gave him rejection.  Maybe he can do better in the future but now he may never try again.\n\nMaybe he is an AH but after losing his wife he is trying to get closer to people in his family.  Just because he is or was an AH does not mean that you should do this same.", "NTA. You weren't even particularly harsh with how you said it. You were just stating facts. The course helped but you were well on your way even before the course, which is credit to you and your parents.", "NTA he's literally trying to buy the credit for both you and your parents hard work", "NTA & congratulations!!! You\u2019re gonna do great", "NTA\n\n*You* earned that scholarship. It would have been one thing if he'd said he was proud to have helped you, but he tried to take call the credit.", "NTA.\n\nHe did help. But he was far from essential like he's claiming.", "NTA.

And you can\u2019t deny that grandpa did contribute, which OP even acknowledges. \n\nWhat OP said to grandpa\u2019s friends undermines his grandpa, embarrasses him in front of his friends, and also gives off an air of ungrateful ness. \n\nWould it have been so hard for OP to just let grandpa brag to his friends? It\u2019s what all grandparents do. It costs nothing to OP. Instead of \u201ccorrecting\u201d grandpa, it would\u2019ve been better to either keep quiet, or acknowledge his contribution and add on that you\u2019re also grateful to your parents.", "I was confused as well, but SAT scoring has changed. 1500+ is likely plenty to get into an Ivy nowadays\n\nhttps://blog.collegevine.com/new-sat-vs-old-sat-score-conversion-chart#conversion\n\nhttps://collegeprep.uworld.com/blog/what-act-sat-score-do-i-need-to-get-into-an-ivy-league-school/#:~:text=Ideal%20ACT%2FSAT%20Scores%20for%20Ivy%20League%20School%20Applications&text=The%20minimum%20SAT%20score%20to,at%20most%20Ivy%20League%20universities.", "Given how much of an AH grandpa is, even doing exactly what you suggested likely would piss him off just as much. Yes, kissing ass can be helpful, but if you have to kiss ass to keep a relationship going, it's almost never worth the effort, personally or professionally - you'll always be manipulated into keeping the peace so you can reap the benefit\n\nNot being an asshole is an excellent idea and great advice, being a doormat is not", "Nowhere in his story did it say he had no other means of taking the prep course - maybe he has some savings or could repurpose a part-time job salary to the course. Of course he'd take his grandpa up on his offer, but that doesn't mean his grandpa was the only reason he's going to an ivy league school. He might have spent more time exploring other options to pay for the course if he realized the strings attached to his grandpa's offer\n\nIn addition, his grandpa is def an AH for not giving OP grace and realizing the 14 years of resentment he'll need to work through bc of the grandpa abandoning his daughter and grandson. If the grandpa truly changed like you're suggesting he did, the grandpa would have a.) been bragging about OPs accomplishments and not claiming OPs success was all due to him and/or b.) would have realized his mistake and not gotten mad at OP because OPs reaction was perfectly understandable for anyone of any age who was not acknowledged for 14 years, and doubly understandable given OP is only 17", "Not necessarily. I\u2019ve been in one of those SAT prep courses and they do make a significant difference that just self studying may not cover.

Considering your original score was already a 1450 and you\u2019re obviously very intelligent you probably could\u2019ve raised your score 50+ points by yourself for free. Paying for the prep course was a nice gesture by your grandfather but is in no way why you got into great schools. In this day and age there is so much more to college applications than SAT/ACT scores.", "You are NTA, if he wants credit then give him credit for a portion of the score you got above 1450. That is what you score yourself, everything above you also got yourself studying but with a financial bump from him. So that is the portion you can give him a slice of credit if he wants it.", "NTA. \n\nRelationships with older people are hard. They just get stuck in their crappy old ways. \n\nIn reality, he FID help you out, so don\u2019t forget to be thankful for his small part. He is clearly proud of you. Maybe next time, just let him take a little bit of the credit and mention him paying for the prep class that helped to make sure all the hard work that you and your parents did in the past came full circle. \n\nThe old man is trying. He clearly sucks at it, but sometimes you just have to give them a little bit of help.", "NTA you earned this with your hard work and your parents did support you through it. \n\nThis may seem petty, but I'd consider paying him back just to have no potential strings over this accomplishment. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think you should feel beholden to him for it - but my own personal feelings about this mean I wouldn't want his payment for the last tiny hurdle in your lifelong race to tinge the rightful pride you should have for it.", "Cash always comes with the lender's dirt. It'll grease you too.\n\nIf possible promptly return that money to him with interest and just avoid contact as much as possible.

Our second in line aced the ACT, got a 1590 on the SAT, varsity team captain. Zero ivys. \n\nThe reality was our high school just wasn't ranked high enough. It's unlikely that this kid was an ideal candidate if ONLY they bumped their SAT a bit. 1500 is probably high enough to get accepted, but it's just not going to be the make or break acceptance factor.", "Then you're not that smart.

Less nerves, more familiarity.\n\nNTA", "College admissions is holistic. I went to an Ivy. I know people who did poorly on the SATs but got in. I also know people who did extremely well but got rejected. SAT, for better and worse, is simply one of many factors considered.", "Unless things have changed, there's no such thing as merit-based scholarships for Ivies---only need-based financial aid.
