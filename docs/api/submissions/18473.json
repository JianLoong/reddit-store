Anyone (even your parents really) that tries to take credit for your accomplishments is a petty, selfish, lonely asshole. \n\nJust to be clear, I don't think your parents are trying to take credit, just your grandpa.", "NTA. He did something for you, but phrasing it like that sends the wrong message, ie he is the one who supported you throughout your life.", "NTA.

Your grandfather lacks insight into his own behavior", "NTA, grandpa is about to find out the price  of his past actions.", "NTA. He tried to take all the credit after showing up only recently and helping you out just a little bit. I'm sure your parents would have helped with take an SAT prep course too. Your grandpa wants to look good in front of his friends by having a jab at your parents. Good on you for standing up for them. You're a great son.\n\nAlso I don't think your grandpa helped you that much in the grand scheme of things. You still had the potential to have a full ride at any college without your grandpa's help. He just paid for the extra SAT practice, you put in the work. Anyone could have paid for it. Like you stated, your parents have supported you your whole life and helped promote your drive to get good grades."]}
