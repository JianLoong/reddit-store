Unless it's a one-off or rare thing or you're not paying for it (i.e. using points, work is paying for it), you're not buying first class tickets if they're actually expensive for you. And that's exponentially more likely with additional kids, never mind 6 (SIX!) of them. And on the internet people always skew what the truth is toward their bias, so claiming: \n\n>my husband has a good job and makes a very good amount of money\n\nlikely means he makes a *filthy* ridiculous amount of money. So it's not a certainty, but I'd bet there's an extremely, extremely good chance upgrading remaining 2 of the 10 tickets she bought wouldn't have affected her family's finances at all. \n\nAnd ultimately, considering the above I think why it rubbed me the wrong way is that if someone were to host a steak dinner party and upgraded 80% of the attendees' dishes from sirloin to wagyu (a significant upgrade, just like first class plane tickets), how would you expect the other 20% to feel?

She needed black work pants so I was gonna buy her several pair from Walmart. At the time they had this amazing pair of durable women\u2019s dress pants (we all wore them at the restaurant I worked at) or I would have bought any of the work pants form there. \n\nShe threw a fit and said she didn\u2019t want them from Walmart. I told her to find me pants and I would order them for her. She sent me a link to $200 pants online and said she needed 4 pair. I told her no, the pants needed to be $50 or less per pair or I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything. She cursed me out and got all her friends to harass me online, calling me cruel and selfish. Yes, selfish because I wouldn\u2019t buy the girl sleeping on an air mattress in someone\u2019s garage several pair of $200 pants\u2026 \n\nGuess who had to quit because she never got work pants??? She pulled that crap again over work shoes, she wanted super expensive ones and threw a fit when our mom bought her $50 ones that were perfect for what she needed. \n\nShe also was pissy with us because we weren\u2019t giving her the money directly.", "Yeah this. If she\u2019s financially stable, she can pay for the upgrade if she needs it so bad.", "I came here to say exactly this. OP was more than generous to pay for the sister and bf, plus cats for economy plus. OP didn't have to do that. If the sister want s to upgrade to 1st class, she can pay the upgrade herself.", "Completely different scenario and she paid to have their cats shipped too", "My thought is OP didn\u2019t want them in first class with her family - if this reaction from her sister is any indication of her personality.", "Fuck this. She didn't have to buy her sister a ticket at all. She was being nice and even got her decent seats. She is an adult, she can upgrade them herself if it means that much to her. You also sound very entitled.\n\nI vote NTA and next time I wouldn't do a damn thing for her or her cats.", "I agree about OP. She either should have not purchased tickets for her sister at all, or bought her the exact same tickets she was buying for everyone else, and your comparison to a steak dinner party in that regard is spot on. OP is not obligated to buy the tickets at all, but ultimately the action she chose is incredibly tacky. Sister is responding incredibly poorly, but no one looks good here.", "Yikes! I sincerely hope her perspective has shifted as she aged.", "Exactly, it would cost more buying a first class ticket outright as opposed to upgrading to it. Sister clearly expects a free 1st class trip courtesy of OP"]}
