OP doesn't mention her where, so I'm just assuming the US.  Isn't there a quarantine period for any animal that's been taken out of the country?  Unless it's an amazingly long trip, I would think that boarding the cats or having a friend check on them regularly would be much less expensive and involved.", "NTA.

The End.\n\nAnd it\u2018s a TERRIBLE idea to travel with cats this time of year, unless you live somewhere where it\u2019s fall going into winter and even then. It\u2019s completely unnecessary and puts their lives in danger multiple times, not to mention the trauma. Cats like their home. Hire a petsitter\u2026it\u2019s infinitely easier on everyone, especially the cats.", "NTA. I would be grateful for someone to pay my ticket in coach or even some of the ticket. People that have less money than others sometimes expect the more wealthy person to always pay. However, if you can afford 8 first class seats no problem she may feel like she\u2019s in economy plus because you don\u2019t want her to sit near you. Still rude behaviour on her part. Besides, you also paid for her boyfriend and 2 cats so she should leave all 3 behind next time she complains.", "NTA. Do NOT upgrade her seats under any circumstances.

I can see know that it was infantalizing to assume you were OK with us paying, but that wasn't at all my intent. I know you both are extremely capable adults and can buy your own plane tickets, I just got wrapped up in the excitement of the trip and overstepped. I don't want to make you any more uncomfortable, so I have cancled the plane tickets I purchased for you. You can now choose whatever seats you want and have the satisfaction that comes from paying your own way. I know you work hard for your money and I respect that you can spend that money however you want. I hope that you can forgive me for not demonstrating that respect by buying your tickets. I have learned my  lesson and I now see that paying for your plane tickets was condescending. I promise not to make the same mistake in the the future and just step in and pay for your travel or lodging or food again.

I think YTA to yourself if you cave to her harassment and buy the upgrade instead of immediately cancelling their tickets and let them pay for their own trip. Would she have gotten first class if she paid for them herself? Good. Then she can pay for them herself. Would they have gotten regular economy if she paid for herself? Fine. She can pay for herself and learn a valuable lesson to not complain when getting free expensive tickets, and upgraded ones at that. \n\nHer reaction to go nuclear immediately and leave a daily insulting message is\u2026.

Would love to have family willing to do this for me!!!", "The sister's attitude is pretty bad and definitely AHish, but I do think OP's actions rub me the wrong way. \n\nThe fact that OP is buying 8 (assuming the husband is with them) first class tickets yet noting they're pretty expensive when talking about only 2 tickets makes no sense to me. Unless it's a one-off or rare thing or you're not paying for it (i.e. using points, work is paying for it), you're not buying first class tickets if they're actually expensive for you. And that's exponentially more likely with additional kids, never mind 6 (SIX!) of them. And on the internet people always skew what the truth is toward their bias, so claiming: \n\n>my husband has a good job and makes a very good amount of money\n\nlikely means he makes a *filthy* ridiculous amount of money. So it's not a certainty, but I'd bet there's an extremely, extremely good chance upgrading remaining 2 of the 10 tickets she bought wouldn't have affected her family's finances at all. \n\nAnd ultimately, considering the above I think why it rubbed me the wrong way is that if someone were to host a steak dinner party and upgraded 80% of the attendees' dishes from sirloin to wagyu (a significant upgrade, just like first class plane tickets), how would you expect the other 20% to feel? Would you just expect them to \"simply thank them profusely\" since they were still given a free dinner? Because that would be absurd, yet that's pretty much what your comment is expecting the sister to say.", "I have to disagree.

You say, \"thank you very much.\" That's a free flight.", "I don\u2019t think OP said her sister would buy her own first-class seats. I assumed sister would be able to pay for economy seats only", "She can upgrade and save money and not yell", "Sister can pay the difference if she wants to upgrade to first class", "Yes, and she's not entitled to that either. It's definitely nice of OP. But that doesn't change the fact that the difference is quite blatant when looking at 8 people vs the sister and her husband. \n\nIf I were in the sister's shoes I'd of course keep quiet and just say thanks, as the constant messages/harassment and claiming OP is selfish are out of line. That doesn't mean I still wouldn't be annoyed, especially since it would make such a small difference to OP to make the two upgrades vs. how big of a difference it would make to the sister.", "The cost of flying my two cats from US to UK was enough to have bought first class tickets for myself and my husband. \n\nI think the discrepancy between 2 Economy+ and two cat tickets and 2 1st Class tickets won't be that much."]}
