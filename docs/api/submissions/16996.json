Unless it's a one-off or rare thing or you're not paying for it (i.e. using points, work is paying for it), you're not buying first class tickets if they're actually expensive for you. And that's exponentially more likely with additional kids, never mind 6 (SIX!) of them. And on the internet people always skew what the truth is toward their bias, so claiming: \n\n>my husband has a good job and makes a very good amount of money\n\nlikely means he makes a *filthy* ridiculous amount of money. So it's not a certainty, but I'd bet there's an extremely, extremely good chance upgrading remaining 2 of the 10 tickets she bought wouldn't have affected her family's finances at all. \n\nAnd ultimately, considering the above I think why it rubbed me the wrong way is that if someone were to host a steak dinner party and upgraded 80% of the attendees' dishes from sirloin to wagyu (a significant upgrade, just like first class plane tickets), how would you expect the other 20% to feel?

I told her to find me pants and I would order them for her. She sent me a link to $200 pants online and said she needed 4 pair. I told her no, the pants needed to be $50 or less per pair or I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything. She cursed me out and got all her friends to harass me online, calling me cruel and selfish. Yes, selfish because I wouldn\u2019t buy the girl sleeping on an air mattress in someone\u2019s garage several pair of $200 pants\u2026 \n\nGuess who had to quit because she never got work pants??? She pulled that crap again over work shoes, she wanted super expensive ones and threw a fit when our mom bought her $50 ones that were perfect for what she needed. \n\nShe also was pissy with us because we weren\u2019t giving her the money directly.", "Yeah this. If she\u2019s financially stable, she can pay for the upgrade if she needs it so bad.", "I came here to say exactly this. OP was more than generous to pay for the sister and bf, plus cats for economy plus. OP didn't have to do that. If the sister want s to upgrade to 1st class, she can pay the upgrade herself.", "Completely different scenario and she paid to have their cats shipped too", "My thought is OP didn\u2019t want them in first class with her family - if this reaction from her sister is any indication of her personality.", "Fuck this. She didn't have to buy her sister a ticket at all. She was being nice and even got her decent seats. She is an adult, she can upgrade them herself if it means that much to her. You also sound very entitled.\n\nI vote NTA and next time I wouldn't do a damn thing for her or her cats.", "I agree about OP. She either should have not purchased tickets for her sister at all, or bought her the exact same tickets she was buying for everyone else, and your comparison to a steak dinner party in that regard is spot on. OP is not obligated to buy the tickets at all, but ultimately the action she chose is incredibly tacky. Sister is responding incredibly poorly, but no one looks good here.", "Yikes! I sincerely hope her perspective has shifted as she aged.", "Exactly, it would cost more buying a first class ticket outright as opposed to upgrading to it. Sister clearly expects a free 1st class trip courtesy of OP", "NTA. Cancel her tix and tell her to buy her own. Or tell her she can pay to upgrade to first class. She is being very rude and unappreciative.", "NTA, cancel the plane tickets. Let her book her own trip.", "You would be the a hole if you upgrade her seats. She's ungrateful and sounds entitled af, you bought her and her bf tickets so she can either pay to upgrade them or you can cancel her tickets and she can pay her own way instead of having a tantrum over her free tickets not being good enough", "Now you know not to book her any tickets!", "Bruh someone could buy me a plane ticket where I have to sit in the luggage hold & id still be eternally grateful. Your sister is entitled, I wouldn\u2019t be buying her a first class ticket, I\u2019d be canceling it. NTA.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t book them first class I would cancel the economy plus tickets and apologize for being so selfish and not buying her \u201eappropriate\u201c tickets so you will let her buy tickets that are up to her standards.  I 100% guarantee she will not buy herself first class.", "NTA. Sounds like you should just cancel her tickets", "NTA, I understand how she feels left out with you all in first class, but if there is the extra expense of the boyfriend and cats, I don't blame you for trying to balance the cost.", "Smile big and say if you want first class PAY FOR YOUR OWN TICKETS YOU MOOCH", "NTA. Just let her know that you understand that she does not want to fly economy, so you canceled the tickets, and she can get something she feels comfortable with.", "NTA. You paid for her AND her boyfriend AND her cats. She should be grateful for that. And, you said she is financially stable so you didn\u2019t even need to in the first place. If she wants first class, she can upgrade. Your sister is absolutely entitled!", "NTA - she can cover the difference in price!", "NTA. Cancel the economy plus, bump them down to cattle class, use the savings for dinner    \n\n\nIf she continues to harrass you with her terrible attitude, cancel her tickets totally. I cant imagine paying for my siblings BOYFRIEND and still getting called selfish", "NTA. If she's upset with the ticket you bought her then cancel it and let her arrange her own.", "Don't book her into first class... explain to her that if she doesn't stop complaining and learn to be grateful that you'll cancel her tickets altogether.  \n\nEven economy plus tickets aren't cheap... and she expects you to give her first class tickets? Nope. She's being incredibly greedy, ungrateful, and entitled.  If I were in your position, I might have already cancelled her tickets already.  If she wants first class, she can pay to upgrade them.  Not you. NTA.  You've been plenty generous enough.", "NTA.  Sounds like your sister and her b/f are ready to pay for the first class seats on their own.  And for their cat also.    Some people just don't know how to be thankful.", "NTA but not great", "I would just cancel her tickets and let her pay for them. I would also remind her you are paying for her cats.", "NTA. I would cancel the ungrateful brats flight. Can you get a refund? Here is a thought, since she and her boyfriend are grown ups, they can pay their own way.", "Not sure where u are originating from, but i strongly suggest she looks into custom laws for bringing her cats to visit.  Also, her cats will suffer a LOT MORE on this trip than finding a pet sitter at home.", "NTA", "NTA - let me edit your statement \u201cI honestly am ready to cancel her tickets\u201d", "NTA\n\nCancel her tickets and let her buy her own.\n\n*\u201cSeeing as the tickets i purchased for you weren\u2019t adequate for your needs, I figured it would be better for everyone involved if you were to purchase your own. That way you can get the seats that you want instead of me making an incorrect assumption on what would work for you.\u201d*\n\nWhatever you do, **do not buy her first class tickets**. That\u2019s a slippery road to her taking bullying and taking advantage of you whenever she can in the future.", "What is it about Indian culture that every time I see a post they have to explicitly state how good a job they having, how successful they are, and how much money they have?", "NTA.\n\nJust refund those tickets and let her buy her own first class tickets if she is so ungrateful.", "\u201cI am really sorry, you\u2019re right, I was insensitive.  I assumed you\u2019d be ok with a certain type of seat, and I shouldn\u2019t have done that.  I went ahead and canceled the tickets, and you can buy the right flight and seat that suits you best.\u201d", "Personally, if I can afford 7 to 8 international first class tickets, I\u2019d buy my sister (whom I love) and her boyfriend first class tickets, too. And if I couldn\u2019t swing the extra tickets, I wouldn\u2019t have purchased her tickets at all, especially since it sounds like she can afford her own. But, it\u2019s rude of your sister to complain. She should purchase her own upgrades. NTA.", "NTA. She's an ungrateful bitc.", "NTA\nBut if it were me, I'd be happy to be the AH. I'd cancel her tickets and tell her she better start walking because India is a long way away", "NTA. Don't relent to her tantrum and give her first class tickets. If you do, you will forever be subjected to her entitled fits.\n\nReply to one of her texts with, \"I purchased economy plus for you and boyfriend. I've also purchased travel for your cats. That is the limit of my generosity. You're welcome to upgrade if this gift is below your standards.\" Then don't discuss it again. Go total grey rock.", "NTA, and don\u2019t reward her self-entitlement - in fact, if she\u2019s going to criticize you for buying her a gift, she can book her own tickets.", "NTA but I\u2019d cancel the tickets", "NTA. Cancel their tickets. They can pay for first class themselves. Or cancel her boyfriend\u2019s ticket and use that money to upgrade her.", "NTA her cats?! I don't think you can even bring cats between countries like that without quarantining and a bunch of hops to jump through.", "No no no- do not book her first class! Cancel her tickets and let her book her own flight! NTA", "Nope. I think you are being generous to buy them tickets at all.", "If I were you I\u2019d just cancel her seats. The audacity to bite the hand that feeds. NTA", "NTA- cancel the tickets and let her rebook herself. Super entitled", "NTA.\n1. Cancel her tickets.  She\u2019s ungrateful and entitled.\n2. Cancel her cats\u2019 tickets.  They are not an accessory. Long flights are harmful to them.", "NTA\n\nBut next time, tell her you'd pay whatever you're willing to, then she can make up the difference if she wants", "NTA. At this point, I would just cancel her tickets and just tell her to pay her own way. You were attempting to do a nice thing for her and she's acting like a spoiled brat.", "\u201cSounds like you are unhappy with the seats I bought you, at my expense, as a loving gesture. I just wanted to let you know that I would never want to cause you this kind of discomfort, so I have decided to cancel the tickets. You are now free to book any tickets you would like, for maximum comfort.\u201d", "It isn't the sister's husband, it's her boyfriend.  And OP is paying to fly the sister's cats, too.", "A transatlantic ticket on economy plus for her sister, the boyfriend, and cats is scraps?! Touch grass.", "Same!! I\u2019m petty enough I\u2019d cancel the tickets for sis, her partner and the cats and say \u201chope to see you in India!\u201d", "Even if the husband and op ARE filthy rich, no one is entitled to THEIR  money and/or upgrades.  Rubs you the wrong way?!?!  Who are you to assume entitlement on the part of the sister?!  Dafuq? People like you made me lose faith in humanity. The audacity!", "You're making huge assumptions that may or may not be true. And I'm sorry, but I don't care if OP's husband is a billionaire, OP's sister should still not feel entitled to fly first class just because.", "To her it is. It\u2019s all relative. You may feel differently if this husband of OP was Jeff Bezos.", "You seem to lack reading comprehension. Yes, the sister is acting entitled with her actions after, but my issue is NOT of thinking she was entitled to anything. It's stepping back and looking at the full picture, where the circumstances don't make sense and rub me the wrong way. \n\nSay you have a rich uncle who invites you on vacation and pays for your accommodation, which sounds great only for you to arrive and you the 20 other people he invited are staying at the 5-star resort while you and your husband get put in a decent 3-star hotel down the street. You're really going to say that wouldn't rub you the wrong way? It wouldn't even raise an eyebrow for you he got you a \"decent\" place and you can upgrade them yourself if it means that much to you? Sit down and learn when to STFU if you don't even know what the argument you're swearing at is.", "Thank you - incredibly tacky is probably a better way to put it, I couldn't think of a better description outside of it rubbing me the wrong way.", "Run through a field of grass at this point. She didn't have to buy the ticket at all. That's generous by any standard. If you're asking for more, that's entitlement.", "Wouldn't rub me the wrong way at all. I would be THANKFUL that he paid for my trip. If it bothered me like it would obviously bother you, I would shut the hell up and try to enjoy myself instead of being jealous of everyone else. You sound petty, insecure, entitled, and like a person I am very grateful isn't in my life beyond a momentary irritation.", "It depends - UK requires pets to enter/exit as manifest cargo using a pet shipper. Insanely expensive.\n\nOther places allow pets to enter/exit with passengers. The fee for this usually ranges $200-$300 per pet (not including any vet work, crates, etc). It\u2019s not cheap but also not breaking the bank compared to first class tickets. \n\nI\u2019m not sure which way you can fly into India though (or if they\u2019re choosing to use a pet shipper for convenience.)"]}
