Unless it's a one-off or rare thing or you're not paying for it (i.e. using points, work is paying for it), you're not buying first class tickets if they're actually expensive for you. And that's exponentially more likely with additional kids, never mind 6 (SIX!) of them. And on the internet people always skew what the truth is toward their bias, so claiming: \n\n>my husband has a good job and makes a very good amount of money\n\nlikely means he makes a *filthy* ridiculous amount of money. So it's not a certainty, but I'd bet there's an extremely, extremely good chance upgrading remaining 2 of the 10 tickets she bought wouldn't have affected her family's finances at all. \n\nAnd ultimately, considering the above I think why it rubbed me the wrong way is that if someone were to host a steak dinner party and upgraded 80% of the attendees' dishes from sirloin to wagyu (a significant upgrade, just like first class plane tickets), how would you expect the other 20% to feel?

Unless she's moving to India with those cats, they're going to be in an airplane for so long in both directions. If the cats are lucky they get to ride in the cabin, which means they're going to be under the seats and if they're not, they're going to be even worse off in cargo. \n\nThough OP might want to check the airline pet policy. Some airlines won't let pets travel in the cabin if you're in first class (or economy+, for that matter) so that might be a good additional excuse to keep the sister out of first class (though the sister really shouldn't take the cats anyway, those poor cats).", "Spot on.\nI'd cancel them all out.\nDo it yourself sister. See you there.", "Only redditors would be mad at someone for paying their flights(including 2 cats).", "She is in her 30s, even when this took place. Even for my wedding, I told her I would pay for her dress within reason. She started sending me links to dresses that were over $500. Then she threw a fit because I said no. Our wedding only cost $1000 total, my dress was only $80. Even her boyfriend was like, \u201cummm wtf are you thinking\u201d to her!", "I think it\u2019s a bit different considering it\u2019s OP and her nuclear family (children and husband). I don\u2019t typically get upset when someone prioritize their immediate family. Now if it was a friend group or mixed family members and she was playing favorites I see your point.", "Says \u201csit down and stfu if you don\u2019t even know what the argument is\u201d after making a point that nobody agrees with lmao.\n\nYes, if someone invited me to a free holiday, and I found out they spent more on themselves and their closer relations, I would not think twice about it.", "Your comparison does not track. The 80% are her nuclear family. It\u2019s not like she paid 1st class for other siblings or other relatives relatives.", "You are right and the people who say that it will not bother them are lying. It is human nature. Simple.", "No, you've just completely misunderstood the point. I'm sorry whatever barn you went to school in didn't cover anything related to manners, but when you purchase an experience as essentially a gift for someone that you are also purchasing for yourself, you get everyone the same experience. Anything else is just rude.", "I said the sister was being a spoiled brat, and that OP was better off not getting the ticket at all. This is like buying someone nosebleed tickets to a concert while buying your entire family front row tickets. Generous? Yes. Kind of weird if it\u2019s not like they even asked for it? Yes.", "Rule number 2 of redditors:\n\nWhen someone doesnt agree with your point, be condescending and mock them.\n\nPs. The barn I went to school didnt teach us into entitled\n brats"]}
