And decided the best way to convince you of this was to repeatedly tell you he\u2019s a good man and your cats will die?\n\nBullet. Dodged.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would\u2019ve said N A H if he was just disappointed, but telling someone they would NEED to get rid of their pets? Absolutely not.\n\nHe has the gall to call himself a good man? Nuclear bomb dodged.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous. Also, question, if he was *that* allergic, wouldn\u2019t he have had some sort of reaction by being around you, even if it was just mild irritation?", "NTA. A, he's not your partner. B, he's not going to be since you found early on that you weren't compatible. And frankly, this was a bullet dodged if he's going to act like that over a rejection. It shows you what happens when he doesn't get his way and it doesn't look pretty. Good for you for knowing when to cut ahead of time, and I'm just sorry that it turned out he needed to be cut for other reasons than pet incompatibility.", "NTA! Those names are ADORABLE and you dodged a bullet. Man or cat, not even a hard choice lol\u2026.. Seriously though, that would\u2019ve been a deal breaker for me too. I love having a cat, always plan to.", "NTA-I have my doubts that Bob was as allergic as he lets on. Someone that severely allergic would put that on his profile and avoid anyone with a cat because cat dander and hair could easily be on OP's clothes and trigger an attack while sitting together.\n\nI'm betting that Bob dislikes cats and uses the allergy complaint as a control move. He gets off by trying to get women to put him before their cats (which given his shitty personality isn't going to happen)!.", "NTA\n\nDude needs to get over himself. You like having cats, he can't be around cats, figuring out if your lives, personalities, sexualities,  ideals, etc. match is the point of dating. He is in no way your \"partner\" at this stage.", "NTA. It is not like you are kicking your husband of 10 years to get a cat. You already have your babies and he had the audacity to tell you you would get rid of them if he moves in like wtf... you didn't \"waste a good man\" you dodged a bullet. What a prick... \nAlso, i choose my pets over many people because they are much nicer and they are my damn kids", "I have a furbaby who is almost 16 years old. I am allergic to her, to the point that one of my lungs partially collapsed once because of the pet dander and fur. On occasion, I will get huge welts if she licks my arm. She doesn\u2019t like to be held or picked up, and she is kind of standoffish. Even through ALL of that, I would still choose her over a relationship.

Once again cats save the day.", "Dude, he MASSIVELY jumped the gun - and did it with stalker-vibes. \n\nWould I be able to choose my cat (who is currently trying to cute-face me into petting him) over a man I loved and wanted to marry? Maybe not. But I wouldn\u2019t just \u201cget rid of\u201d him either - i honestly don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019d do.\n\nWould I dump a guy if been on two dates with and am not attached to yet because being around my adored cat would put his life at risk? Yup. He can go date a cat-hater. \n\nThis guy\u2019s reaction is over the top and weird. It\u2019s not like you were serious yet", "NTA. You've had the cats longer than him. I wouldn't abandon my pets for anyone. And I'd be disturbed if anyone thought I should- or even could just \"get rid of them\". Pets are not only a responsibility, they are living creatures that we love. You don't just get rid of someone you love.", "The allergy is a perfectly valid reason to break it off. His ridiculous drama is, too. NTA", "NTA. What a jerk. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA - you picked your priority and it isn\u2019t some guy you\u2019ve known for two days", "NTA\n\nIt is reasonable to not date someone who is allergic to your pets. I would have made the same choice for my dogs. Given his reaction, it sounds like the kitties deserve a treat for revealing the guy's true colors before the relationship could progress further.", "If he actually had a severe allergy to cats, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hang out with you for any significant amount of time without at least a mild reaction.", "NTA\n\n3 dates and he's speculating about moving in? That's already a problem. A big one.  Not only is it awfully fast,  but it  would make me worry that he just expects to be accommodated when there is a problem. If he was going to make noise about eventually moving in together,  he should have been talking about seeing if a series of allergy shots was possible. \n\nMy misgivings are kind of born out by his subsequent behavior. \n\nAnyway,  one of the reasons we date someone is to find out if we're compatible enough to potentially get serious about a long term commitment .\n\nA cat lover and someone with a severe allergy to cats? If it's not an instant dealbreaker,  it's certainly  not an auspicious start.\n\n I would never have rehomed my cat for a guy and it helped my husband's cause tremendously that the first time he came to my house,  my cat sniffed him twice,  demanded pets & then curled up in his lap. That cat usually just sat on a bookshelf and glared at unfamiliar guests. That was more than 20 years ago. Obviously,  my advice is to hold out for someone your cats like.", "NTA. The entitlement of this guy is astounding. I\u2019m surprised at his audacity to expect this of you on the THIRD DATE.", "Totally justified. NTA.   \nPlease pay the cat tax though.", "NTA. Pets are family members, what he's expecting you to do is pretty much like telling someone they'll have to get rid of their kids if they ever move in together. It's a perfectly reasonable deal breaker, in fact to me it's a deal breaker if someone has the attitude that pets are just something you get rid of when they become inconvenient.", "NTA I mean \ud83d\udea91) He\u2019s talking about moving in after TWO dates YIKES ON BIKES, \ud83d\udea9 2) Assuming you will just get rid of your cats to accommodate him, \ud83d\udea9 3) Self proclaims he\u2019s such a great guy while harassing you after being politely rejected!\n\nLike you didn\u2019t just dodge a bullet you dodged a whole shotgun loaded with rock salt.", "Lol. In this case you too could say your cats can outlive him as he could die out of an alergic reactions and the cats - not.\n\nNTA, good thing you found out he's a walking red flag that early", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm one of those severely allergic to cats people. Some relationships just don't work out.

So, I am deathly allergic to cats. I don't recall if it came up in the first date or 2 with my wife, since its been nearly 17 years, but she lived with roommates that had cats, but had none of her own with her. We hit it off immediately, and she has always said she knew she wanted to marry me on that 1st date. So...eventually, we did have to have a conversation about cats, and that her cat that for other reasons was several states away at her mom's, would not be able to join us. She was disappointed, but it was a decision we talked about and agreed on after our relationship became solid. this dude...yikes. I feel like this came out of a bad sitcom where he assumes marriage is in the cards at once.  you are absolutely right to run run run away. \n   And for the record, while I had decided by date 2 I had found my future wife, neither of us began even hinting at it out loud to each other for several months. And I did not ask until we had passed 6 months, and then moved in together(best way to be really sure about a person). This dude is jumping way too many steps and planting a red flag by all of them.", "NTA. \n\nYou did GREAT. Good you learnt about his allergy and attitude early on, so you could break it off quickly before getting serious.\n\nIf his allergy is so bad, HE should be the one looking for someone who has no cats and does not care of ever having a cat in the future.", "Nta the sea is plenty of fishs", "NTA-what a dick. and it's also just dumb to expect to take importance in a new relationship over your new partner's pets, sorry, but that's just how it is  and besides it's always better to just break up if you come to a disagreement like that, especially like that. Because if you actually went ahead and had a relationship with this guy and then actually got rid of your cats, there would be a building resentment and hatred and then he could also just leave you and you would've gotten rid of literal family members for him and he might've not even stayed, blaming you if you get upset with him so you dodged pretty much a whole bomb.", ">\u201cNobody should choose their pets over their partner.\u201d\n\nThe man said something right. \n\nOnly thing is that he wasnt a partner.
