Because if you actually went ahead and had a relationship with this guy and then actually got rid of your cats, there would be a building resentment and hatred and then he could also just leave you and you would've gotten rid of literal family members for him and he might've not even stayed, blaming you if you get upset with him so you dodged pretty much a whole bomb.", ">\u201cNobody should choose their pets over their partner.\u201d\n\nThe man said something right. \n\nOnly thing is that he wasnt a partner.

Never getting rid of my fur-family, for anyone.\n\nMy daughter is allergic to cats, and although we mostly visit them, she'll take meds before visiting us.\n\nIt's really sad, because she loves animals.\n\nLol, she has 2 chickens now.", "NTA-if he really wanted to be with you the cats wouldn\u2019t be an issue,you could possibly have looked at renting together long term in a place where the cats were only allowed in certain rooms in the future.he\u2019s selfish and only considering his own feelings,not yours or the cats.don\u2019t worry,there\u2019s plenty of men out there that love cats", "NTA. 3rd date you\u2019re barely at the beginning of finding out if you\u2019re compatible. You don\u2019t need any significant reason, but him being epi-pen allergic to your companion animals is a great reason. \n\nHim waving a red flag afterwards just makes it even clearer.", "NTA but he\u2019s nuts", "I stopped dating people because they were vegetarian or vegan. I love ribs, they hands down will always win for me.\n\nNtA \n\nAnd honestly, considering how he reacted to your no after 2 dates, you can just imagine the stalker he would have become after a couple of months.", "NTA. I do agree that you shouldn't put pets before partners, but *he wasn't your partner*. It's not like you two had been dating for a while & then you chose to get cats despite knowing he's allergic. Then you'd be an asshole. But you already had the cats & you'd only been on 2 dates!", "NTA. I am adding to the chorus of bullet dodged. I would have dumped his ass immediately too! Ugh, so many red flags. My cat is absolutely a deal breaker \ud83d\ude3b", "NTA \n\nThe trash will take itself out \ud83d\ude0c showed you his true colours after 2 dates so you\u2019ve certainly dodged a bullet!", "NTA\n\nYou were on your *third* date. And he\u2019s talking about if he moves in? You certainly weren\u2019t \u201cpartners.\u201d", "NTA and good for you. You should always choose your pets. They come first.", "He should probably mention the allergies in his profile, save himself some trouble. Also he should just delete the profile- not ready to date like a human person. \n\nNTA", "Yes.", "NTA perfect reaction of you", "NTA- who even mentions moving in together on the 2nd date!!! Like wtf? \n\nAnd partners? You\u2019re barely above being acquaintances at this point", "\"Cats will die\" Yeah, and after that I'll get a new cat, but I still won't date you!\nHow unhinged is he that he just straight up said you have to throw your cats away for him? Like, how important does he think he is to someone who's met him only 2 times before this? Why would you ever think you're more important to a stranger than their pet? \nPeople without pets generally do not understand what it's like to have one and the unconditional love you have for them, but some are just next level like this guy...", "You barely even saw him to class him as a partner ontop of the fact he also said straight away without a choice that you\u2019d have to get rid of them if he moved in. You had your pets way before you met him therefore of course your gonna be more attached to them than him. NTA", "NTA and you dodged a bullet.", "Lol. The guy got upset and changed his tune real fast. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is severely allergic to cats and you want to have cats in your life. There's no compromise there.\n\nI LOVE bread and things with gluten. I don't like a lot of the gluten-free stuff I tried and I am vegan so not a lot of 'alternatives' are suitable. I honestly could not imagine dating someone who is deathly allergic to gluten because I am unwilling to cut out all gluten and anything made from/with gluten out of my life.", "NTA.  You DID dodge a bullet.  He is unhinged.", "Bullet dodged man", "This is your third date. He\u2019s \u201cepi pen allergic to cats\u201d which means their dander\u2026I am absolutely positive that you are covered in kitty dander but no allergic reaction? Seems like he\u2019s the fucking asshole and a liar to boot. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA\n\nYou dodged a gobshite.\n\nAfter two dates he's nowhere near considered a partner. You made the right choice.", "NTA and huge bullets dodged! It's sad that he's allergic to cats but it doesn't give him the right to dictate other people's lives, hell even less since it was only a third date!\n\n>my two cats, Ed Sheeran and Bartholomeow (please don\u2019t question their names)\n\nI have to ask because I think their names are so cute and I'm a huge Ed Sheeran fan haha. Please tell me he's a ginger kitty! \ud83d\ude01", "Nta, personally I believe the opposite that most people SHOULD choose their pets over their partners. Your true partner, when you find them, will be with you the rest of your life but your pets are only a small fraction of your life while you are a part of their WHOLE life. Pets should be everything to a person because you are everything to them.", "NTA. Block that weirdo.", "Um he's not your partner! Yes choose your pets over someone you barely know.", "Yup, bullet dodged, nicely done!\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI was on the fence about breaking up prematurely over cats but his response says you dodged a bullet.", "NTA him talking about being partners and him moving in with you after 2 dates is very odd and presumptuous.", "NTA\nYou definitely dodged a bullet. He wasn't your partner, he was some bloke who thought he was higher value than he really is. \nWell done for prioritising your existing family.", "Nta. Even without his appalling behaviour afterwards, it's the right decision to make. You made a commitment to the cats before you even met this trashfire, and it's absolutely acceptable to break things off with this obvious incompatibility. His response absolutely shows you had a lucky escape", "NTA, but I'm suspicious of his claim. If his as allergic as he claims, how come did he not have a reaction to you on your dates? Not to say you're a cat lol but I'm sure you've had some cat hair or whatever on you, it's impossible to avoid it entirely, isn't it...", "Wow NTA", "I'd break up with someone if they didn't want my dogs sleeping on the bed, so NTA.", "Well, at least you look real.\n\nNTA and I'm glad you broke it off. As a cat owner, in theory, you have dander on your clothes. Tell him he's clearly lucky he didn't inhale a noseful of it while you were dating, and you daren't risk it since he's so allergic he could die if he doesn't have an epi-pen on him. If you have a chance, say it with wide, tearful eyes and dramatic hand-waving. He won't know what to do.", "Self proclaimed good people are the worst", "I mean, good that he talks about things like this so soon. Imagine they are in love and plan the wedding and only then he says he expects to throw cats away. Thank God he did it now.", "\u201crelationships can last a lifetime and cats will die\u201d\n\nsomeone please tell Bob that people also die", "I don\u2019t have pets and I wouldn\u2019t really want them either. Plus I\u2019m allergic to cats.\n\nBut this dude is crazy. No one says that and no one in their right mind thinks that.\n\nBullet dodged indeed.", "More like a cannonball \ud83d\ude02", "That \"you wasted a good man\" just screams... just screams honestly. No good man bombs anyone with messages how good he is.", "Him: \u201cYou\u2019re wasting a good man!\u201d\nOP: \u201cOh no! Do you have his number?\u201d\n\nNTA. And love the way he was all like \u201cif I ever move in.\u201d He\u2019s already got designs on OP\u2019s place. Yikes.", ">He then harassed me for the next two days telling me that I was \u201cwasting a good man\u201d \n\nYes, typical good man behavior, harassing people who turn you down. Sucks to be him and I can get it hurts to hear pets are more important than you, but this is date 3, this isn't a commited relationship yet. OP has seen how he truly is and should consider this a bullet dodged.", "And cat tax op please", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Also this: if he didn't have an fairly quick reaction to being in your place with the cats, he isn't being truthful. Sometimes, people don't like cats, so they say they're allergic", "What does he do about work, grocery shopping, sporting events? He can\u2019t demand all his coworkers get rid of their pets too.", "Yep, definitely.\n\nA friend of mine is allergic to cats. The allergy is so mild that he can still be at our house if he takes an antihistamine pill. He can even pet our cats if he washes his hands immediately after. And even with that mild allergy, he reacts with mild itching when we sit too close together outside our house.\n\nSo it doesn't scale that this dude had no reaction at all while interacting with OP but needs an epipen in case of direct contact to a cat.", "I had a physical therapist that was allergic to cats and the only reason I found out was because she started sneezing real bad during our session.", "This! I'm honestly doubting the veracity of his claim. I am allergic to cats, and dogs. The sniffles, itchiness, etc. kind. If someone has a decent amount of cat/dog fur on their clothes, it's sufficient to make me itch. I get that it won't be enough to make him need his epipen but some amount of itch/sniffles? And even if he isn't lying, why wouldn't he avoid people with cats? People with life threatening, epipen needing allergies are usually fairly cautious.", "Yeah, my godfather is very allergic to cats, but not epi-pen allergic and he takes a pill when he sees me (not in my house) or else he will caugh and tear up, so\u2026 bullshit.", "One of my best friends was like you. Allergic, but with a cat heart. She loved my orange guy, and he reciprocated, so every night she spent with me, she left with red drippy eyes and sore throat. \n\n\nShe met a guy who had a cat, and little bit by little bit, her allergic reaction got less severe. Today they live all 3 together, and she loves her guy's cat like her own.\n\n\n And she sometimes still reacts, when she's exhausted or sick. She would never had asked to get rid of a pet. What is wrong with people, pets are not plushies.", "I am allergic to my cats also, not as bad as you, but still NO ONE gets between me and my cats.

That she won't get rid of her cat for a boy?
