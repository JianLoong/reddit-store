Because if you actually went ahead and had a relationship with this guy and then actually got rid of your cats, there would be a building resentment and hatred and then he could also just leave you and you would've gotten rid of literal family members for him and he might've not even stayed, blaming you if you get upset with him so you dodged pretty much a whole bomb.", ">\u201cNobody should choose their pets over their partner.\u201d\n\nThe man said something right. \n\nOnly thing is that he wasnt a partner.

The cats are a better deal \n\nMy major criteria for continuing to date someone was how they reacted to meeting my large, but friendly and polite, dogs for the first time.\nIf they didn't end up on the floor playing with them, no more dates. \nThis criteria served me well. \n\nEven my friend's dad who \"hates dogs and thinks they are pointless\" ended up unable to resist \" excuse me good sir. I have this ball. Perhaps you could throw it? I'll just put it here on the floor and sit patiently in case you do\". \nHe threw the ball for over an hour. Dog slept for the next 3 days.", "NTA. You can leave someone for whatever reason you want.", "NTA, you can break up with someone for WHATEVER reason you consider. Seems to me like you dodged a bullet since he got so annoying afterwards and especially taking so lightly that you have pets and they are important to you. Zero empathy, to hell with him", "NTA holy shit his reaction\n\nalso i\u2019m a queer woman and i\u2019m super allergic to cats and i\u2019m *fully* aware this is a dealbreaker for tons of people, especially those that *already* have cats. this is actually a huge problem in sapphic dating because like\u2026 everyone has a fucking cat. which i get it!! i would too!! but no this man has entitled main character syndrome", "NTA\n\n> I would have to get rid of them if he ever moved in.\n\nI would have stopped the date at that point. No need to lose time.", "Maybe he will die sooner than your cats.\nHow can he know\n\nNta", "The cats came first not the guy. So. The guy can either figure out how to live with it or not. I know people who have gotten allergy treatment (regular course of shots) plus loved with other changes like air filters, regular washing of the said pets, etc. In order to treat their allergies to stay with the partner with the pets bc they understood jt was a package deal. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If you know you want cats in your life then someone who is that allergic to cats isn\u2019t compatible with you or your life. By being up front sooner rather than later like you did, you are ensuring that neither his or your time will be wasted. To refer to himself as a \u201cpartner\u201d after only 3 dates or hang outs, is nutty and definitely a red flag. Someone who doesn\u2019t understand pets are family is an even bigger red flag. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA\n\nYour cats worked as a great litmus test here and made him show his true colours real quick, didn't they? :-) You should give them a snack and thank them :-D", "My SO is allergic  to cats and dogs. Cats is epipen situation, dogs not so much. So we don't have pets we travel too much for dogs and cats are off the table. Just means we can travel longer.", "NTA. You dodged a bullet", "NTA alot of cats outlives most relationships in the world, and I'm not even a fan of cats ( dog person ).", "You are most definitely NTA. I would chose my cat over some rando any day of the week! Pets are family. Also, anyone who, on date 3, is telling you what you **have** to do is to be avoided. Asking if you might be willing to is another matter (would still be a no for me!). Good bullet dodging, my friend!", "NTA,\n\nYou had your pets before you met him and you'll have your pets after you break up with him.\n\nI can't really stand people who think you're supposed to give away your family for them because that's what pets are. Family.", "NTA, if I dated a girl that was allergic to my dog or didn\u2019t like dogs, she is gone. Pooches before cooches.", "Not saying he's lying but you more than likely have cat and cat hair on you.if he was that allergic the probably wouldn't be able to get near you", "NTA \n\nYou made the only right decision, your furbabies should always come first", "NTA. I also have severe cat allergies and intentionally wouldn\u2019t date cat owners because I would never want someone to have to choose. Cats may not live long compared to humans but pets are very important parts of our lives.", "Clearly he haven't had a pet. I consider my dog as a family member, in a million years I wouldn't give her away. Some people need to understand that pets will go in priority with new realtionships", "NTA and you dodged a bazooka round sized bullet. Dear God. If he's thinking about moving in with you and the 3rd date, where you have only just shown him your cats, then he was moving *WAY* too fast. Your cats are your babies, and you don't have to get rid of them for ANYONE. You did good choosing them over him. Choosing your pets, who are essentially your children, over some dude you were just barely getting to know, was definitely the right choice.", "NTA\n\nHe wasn\u2019t your partner. He\u2019s someone goi went on a few dates with. \n\nPets are for life. A responsible owner commits to caring for their pets until the pet passes away. With the exception of unforeseen medical emergencies (Eg giving birth and finding out the baby is deathly allergic, or an accident that leaves the owner unable to care for the pet, etc) the pets are permanently attached to their owner. \n\nThis guy was delusional. His life needs to be cat-free, but that means finding a partner who doesn\u2019t have or want cats.", "NTA but\u2026 cat tax?", "NTA", "After his reaction, i think him being allergic to the cats happened for a very good reason. You seem to have dodged a very unhealthy relationship.", "It's funny because you made a future decision yet get annoyed when he's a bit miffed that not only did you carry on with the date but ridicule him for also thinking ahead. You're a red flag cat lady!", "NTA and you dodged a massive bullet", "NTA  \nSome people just don't lead compatible lives.  \nWhen you took two cats into your home, you committed to caring for them. You would be betraying them really badly to get rid of them for a guy you basically just met.  \nEveryone should choose their pets over relationships.  \n\n\nHis reaction just cements that it was the right choice to me.  \nComing second-best to your cats apparently was a real ego-blow to him.  \n\n\nFind yourself a fellow cat-lover and forget this guy.", "NTA\nIf you love cats, you need them in your life. \nYou don't need someone who tells you on the second or third date to abandon family members(which cats are).\n\nAnd if he's such a great guy like he claims, I'm sure he will find himself a good woman without cats. :)", "That's what I was thinking. That's a big red flag all on its own.", "THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING.  He obviously can't be that allergic if he didn't react at all with having the \"I'll die and need an epipen\" level.  I have big time allergies.  Not even the going to die level.  But if I catch a whiff of my allergens, I'm immediately fucked up.", "I have an anaphylactic allergy to cats. I can visit with my mom outside of her home without a severe reaction, most of the time. Sometimes I have to ask her to sit across the room.", "yup nta,\n\ni got that as well he doesn't sound like a good guy. plus absolutely no empathy for the poor kitties when he said it.\n\ntoo much criminal minds I am weary of any guy who doesn't seem to like pets.\n\nto be clear having allergies or dislikes is fine, the lack of emotion about it was the creepy part. \n\ni would worry about living with anyone with a big snake, they might eat my cat. I like snakes they are cool, but yeah they can be incompatible with other small creatures.", "I have a human child too and I\u2019d still choose my pets over most people.", "Well, he didn\u2019t knew there were pets before the 3rd date. But there is a vast difference between deciding you love cats and there are other \u201cgood men\u201d and stop dating that guy or being married and the partner then develops an allergy.\nHis reaction makes him the AH. OP NTA.", "I can still imagine someone choosing their pets in that situation. You can choose whether to continue being with someone for any reason you like.", "Of course they can but the partner would have the right to expect to be chosen in that situation imo."]}
