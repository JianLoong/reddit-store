She asked me if she could drop my nephew off and have me watch him for 6 hours today, since she forgot that the daycare for my nephew was closed today, and I immediately declined. But I didn\u2019t decline for no reason. Me and my friend(m19) have been planning for about a week to hangout on my day off from work, to hang out quite literally all day long, go see a couple of movies, and just chill out and relax. My sister texted me and asked if I could watch my nephew for a few hours so she can go to her OBGYN appointment(another nephew on the way) and a few other errands when I\u2019m not going to be available, so I declined and explained the situation. Instead of being understanding that I\u2019ve made plans, she ridiculed me for not making time for helping out family, and then told her fianc\u00e9(m24) and he wasn\u2019t as ridiculing, but still was upset about the ordeal. My mom is also against me, but my stepdad and my friend are on my side.
