But I didn\u2019t decline for no reason. Me and my friend(m19) have been planning for about a week to hangout on my day off from work, to hang out quite literally all day long, go see a couple of movies, and just chill out and relax. My sister texted me and asked if I could watch my nephew for a few hours so she can go to her OBGYN appointment(another nephew on the way) and a few other errands when I\u2019m not going to be available, so I declined and explained the situation. Instead of being understanding that I\u2019ve made plans, she ridiculed me for not making time for helping out family, and then told her fianc\u00e9(m24) and he wasn\u2019t as ridiculing, but still was upset about the ordeal.

You're allowed to say No. Your sister and BIL should always have a plan B in case the daycare is closed, the child is sick or whatever comes up and it shouldn't be the teenaged sibling who is more than likely going to have their own plans like teenagers do.

Why doesn't the father take time off work to watch his child? Your sisters poor planning shouldn't affect you.

She does not get to dictate your day off, or any of your time, because she has a child. \n\nYou made a committment, you do not need to drop everything because your sister did not plan accordingly.   \nUnfortunately, in these situations I tend to advise to stand your ground or you will be expected to bend every time she needs help.
