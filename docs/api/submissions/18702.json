It\u2019s sad I stick to it because of people like op\u2019s sister. I am not a on demand nanny!", "No matter what the reason he should have to watch the kid. Especially if it\u2019s a doctor appointment. Because dr appointment are booked weeks in advance. Her lack of planning is not op\u2019s problem. sister didn\u2019t plan because how dare op to say no.", "Nope I have never babysit my neices or nephews. I have a strict rule I don\u2019t babysit.\n\nIf op says no a 100 times that is her choice. She is never obligated to babysit for anyone.\n\nThe people who say it takes a village or you need to help with them because family helps family can step on legos. It\u2019s away of justifying/guilting someone into taking care of your kid.\n\nI have raised 3 kids I can count on 1 hand I had a true emergency and needed a baby sitter. Never did I ask family I hired a babysitter.", "Op clearly stated \u2018I\u2019ve never declined a request from sister to babysit before today\u2019.", "I have a rule I don\u2019t babysit for anyone but my grandchild unless it\u2019s a true emergency. My definition of an emergency not yours. \n\nBecause of people like op\u2019s sister. You babysit one time then they think you should drop everything because you know we are family.", "Unless you actually want to maintain relationships in your life. That is such a counterproductive bit of advice that I see all the time on here. No one is ever \u201cobligated\u201dto do anything if they are fine with being alone, and why you do things makes a difference.", "Your poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me.", "Nope he is allowed to have plans. His sister lack of planning does not constitute and emergency for op. He said no! Doesn\u2019t matter why he is allowed to say no.\n\nSister needs to realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. People should not cancel plans to watch her kid!", "Bad bot", "Where is that? Kids are allowed to go to them where I am.", "It isn\u2019t necessary to explain everything. People think they are owed an explanation, very seldom is it necessary.", "Sis is not entitled to use her brother as a babysitter whenever she feels like it.", "If maintaining a relationship is dependent on acquiescing to his sisters every demand,  op doesn't have a relationship. He's a victim of extortion/blackmail.", "Not to be annoying but OP is a he", "Just so you know, youre responding to a bot lol", "Or tattle to mommy because op said no", "Sorry thank you. I would never misgender someone on purpose. I\u2019ll go fix it.", "Sorry how can you tell?", "Biggest clues on a profile are not \"new\" but not old. Bunch of comments in a rapid period but nothing before that. Some of the comments seem out of left field and random and not following the discussion they're taking part in.\n\nThen it's a matter of finding whatever comment they copied in the existing thread. Normally with a slight modification but same comment beginning.", "Thank you I was wondering how to tell."]}
