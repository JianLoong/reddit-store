But I didn\u2019t decline for no reason. Me and my friend(m19) have been planning for about a week to hangout on my day off from work, to hang out quite literally all day long, go see a couple of movies, and just chill out and relax. My sister texted me and asked if I could watch my nephew for a few hours so she can go to her OBGYN appointment(another nephew on the way) and a few other errands when I\u2019m not going to be available, so I declined and explained the situation. Instead of being understanding that I\u2019ve made plans, she ridiculed me for not making time for helping out family, and then told her fianc\u00e9(m24) and he wasn\u2019t as ridiculing, but still was upset about the ordeal.

You could be planning on going to a movie,or just sit at home and watch tv or take a nap or just planning on doing NOTHING that day.  \n\nNTA", "She wanted to go to a movie!", "Also sister can bring her son to the doctors appointment and to run errands, not like it\u2019s for work!", "Exactly", "I believe that when people say it or at least when I say it is. You can decline with no in depth reason. No I can't or sorry I have something I have to do. You are technically just saying no but using flowery language to not sound like am asshole.", "Finally!  Thank you! \n\nI thought I was crazy or not getting it. \n\nTo me it is just politeness to give some information why I am saying no. Just as it is polite to not abuse that information as a reason to get a 'yes'  \n\nOnly when people do try to devalue the reason to get their way, then I'll start giving them less info.", "If your relationships are conditional on acceptable excuses, then thats unfortunate.", "Wait I didn\u2019t see that! Wtf?! \n\nNope. I\u2019d get asking last minute for just the appointment but nah. Fuck that. That\u2019s taking advantage", "This is that op said sorry got plans family flips out on him because they believe that ops plans don't matter and they should drop the plans to watch the child.", "lol my family taught me that!", "I hope the pregnancy in the summer treats you okay. Odd and annoying that kids aren't allowed at the offices where you are.. and because I forgot to judge, I also think OP is NTA.", "Not just 'I can't' but 'I already made plans.' but no need to give details - that leads to negotiations.", "Depends on the situation.   Diplomacy is always smoother.  But some people will insist on arguing and not get the hint.   No is enough.", "Thank you! Luckily it\u2019s been on the cooler side so far, so weird but I\u2019ll take it! \n\nit\u2019s SO annoying, like what if I was a single mom and couldn\u2019t afford child care? They literally see me for like 15 min at check ups and my baby can\u2019t be there? Doesn\u2019t make sense.", "That really doesn't. My friend has been single momming it with two toddlers. It really opens a person's eyes to how harsh the world can be.", "NTA. She asked last minute and you had plans. She is the parent of m4 therefore she is the one that needs to sort it out when there isn't an available babysitter. Plenty of parents take their kids to appointments, obviously it isn't always ideal but this is a problem that she made.", "NTA\n\nHer lack of planning is not your problem. Why can't she bring the kid with her to the appointment and errands?", "NTA. This isn\u2019t even a crucial babysitter need, it\u2019s a convenience. People take their older kids to the ob with them all the time, and obviously to run errands too. I regularly took my 2 and 3 year olds with me to my ob appointments if my hubby couldn\u2019t take off to chill with them, it wouldn\u2019t have even occurred to me to hire a sitter or ask someone besides their dad to watch them for that reason. This is one kid, and he\u2019s 4. She can take him along. Or your mom or the kid\u2019s dad can watch him if they think it\u2019s necessarily.", "NTA - your sister is the one that forgot about the day care being closed. Unless the daycare closure was last minute, OP is still not obligated to drop his plans. Sister needs to close the baby factory if daycare is an issue.", "NTA. Why is she so adamantly counting on pawning her kid off on you? Lol", "NTA I don't like kids either.  That's the only reason I need.", "NTA. Lack of planning on her part doesn't commit you.", "I would have asked why the fianc\u00e9 the baby\u2019s father did take care of his own kid rather than demanding you NTA", "Not the asshole. You shouldn't be at your sisters beck and call. \n\nBut as a parent - you have no idea what kind of help you're providing just watching a kid for a few hours. Your sister probably struggles in ways you can't imagine. If you wanna blow her mind one day, offer without her asking to watch the kid for a couple hours.  I would kill for my family to want to help out like that.", "No. She took for granted that you would just do it like you don't have a life. Even if you wanted to lay around all day that's your business and you don't owe anyone an explanation, no is no.", "NTA. In the future information diet is the way to got too much information will be used against you. Saying you have plans to hang out and this and that will only be turned to you as not important and silly that you should watch him. It\u2019s unfair to you for your to feel like your plans are of no importance because she dropped the ball it\u2019s her child not yours. Keep it short and sweet sorry I have plans. \u201cI can\u2019t scheduling conflict\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve committed to something important that I can\u2019t back out to\u201d. Don\u2019t go into details it really doesn\u2019t matter if your busy your busy.", "Ummm what is she doing having another kid when she can\u2019t get a schedule for the first ? Tf?", "NTA, she wanted kids and you didn\u2019t", "Correct. Just like work should not need to know why you can\u2019t come in on your day off, family does not need to know. No is no. Simple", "I mean, kind of not, but also she has a medical appointment that was almost certainly scheduled weeks, if not months ago. Today is the day she asks for help? \n\n\"Sorry, I'm out of the country I'll text you later sis.\"", "dad was at work and my mom was at work as well.", "Realistically I think 3 hours (drop off the kid, go to the appointment, .....wait...., finish the appointment and pick up the kid) seems reasonable. Maybe an hour for groceries or something (and she's pregnant so everything takes a bit longer) and 6 hours doesn't seem like a ridiculous amount of time. However, she didn't ask, she demanded that time and that is why she is the AH here. \n\nOP is NTA and I think everyone is in agreement there. I'm just saying that the 6 hours is honestly okay with me, if you would have simply requested my time.", "I drove 2 and half hours to one and back the other day and THAT was barely 6 hours lol", "Agreed. Personally I look at it as this: If I request something and someone has plans of any variety then that is what that is. I may ask them if they have any ideas for an alternative (different time, do they know someone who could help, etc.) but I am not entitled to demand anything. That said I know too many people who do not think that way and prove a lot if I say it that way. \ud83d\ude15", "Mine were allowed in, too.", "This is how it works among adults, yes.\n\n\"I'll just text my little brother in the morning - it's his day off so he can babysit\" is a pretty terrible attitude. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't \"I have an OBGYN in a week - let's see if little brother is free \\[and then offer payment!\\]\".  It wasn't \"I'm dealing with a terrible emergency and can't get hold of anyone else. Could you please watch $NEPHEW for a few hours? I'm terribly sorry that this is on such short notice, and realize that you probably have plans. But I have X bleeding all over the carpet and need to get to the ER.\" Any of these, I might think the OP should make at least some effort (though only in the second I think there's a bit of an obligation to help). But if he gets casually taken for granted, then the sister needs to learn that a casual \"I'm not available today!\" is an appropriate answer.", "Sorry I was making a joke about the fact that the OOP planned to go see a movie(s) with his friend.", "Oh hahaha I thought you meant his sister oops", "My parent emigrated when I was 4 and my brother was almost 2\u2026 we had NO family. ZERO. And you know what she did when she had to run errand/make appointments while my Dad worked? SHE TOOK US WITH HER. Let your sister take responsibility for her own kids, geez. NTA.", "Absolutely not the asshole.", " Nta it\u2019s not your responsibility to watch anyone kid except your own", "Welp, looks like from now on you are unavailable to babysit for free at the drop of a hat, since she won't take no for an answer even one time.\n\nr/ChoosingBeggars", "NTA no one is entitled to free childcare from family. just because you don\u2019t have kids doesn\u2019t mean you need to watch someone else\u2019s ? \u201cno\u201d is a full sentence", "This is great advice for loads of situations. Works wants to call you in \"I'm very sorry I can't make it to work today\".\n\nNo reason as to why, no reason for them to be mad", "agreed kids aren\u2019t allowed in my OB office but i don\u2019t get why husband couldn\u2019t stay with the kid", "Getting a break from her child", "Sounds like if they really cared they would cancel their plans. Something something village.", "Bet she\u2019s not even paying him", "NTA.\n\nAnd the father? He doesn't need to go the OBGYN appointment and all. Or maybe he's the type he cannot keep the kid by himself???", ">Unfortunately I did have to end up babysitting nephew until 12:30pm, and then passed him off to a family friend so I could narrowly make the movie scheduled at 1.\n\nWhy did you have to babysit your nephew?", "NTA. And she\u2019s having another baby probably will ask you to babysit with this new baby too. You had plans to bad so sad for her. You\u2019re not obligated to watch her child it\u2019s her responsibility not yours.", "I used to get called to baby sitter duty on the drop of a dime often by my siblings. It was really frustrating that they expected me to do this and give up my time simply because I choose not to have children yet. I was 23 when they started having kinds so this issue arose during my mid twenties. Anyhow i it really bothered me so I set two rules or boundaries. 1. I set a date and timeframe that was the same every week that was during my personal rime that I would be willing to drop plans (meaning myself would keep plans local) so if needed, they could call upon me. 2. Said all other requests would need to be a week out as I schedule myself two weeks out and need to be fair with other people\u2019s plans as well.\nI could understand if a true emergency popped up\u2026. But things like oh I wanna go do xyz will you help (often a social event)\u2026  NO! I wanna do xyz and I designed my life in way to have that freedom. I\u2019m 34 now, still without kids\u2026 what can I say, I like to do me.", "NTA.\n\nI'm in an awful mood today, quite unwell and haven't been able to keep my very necessary mood stabilisers down for a week. If anyone needs me to give family or friends a well needed, written reality check. Drop me a line.\n\nI'm sure you love your nephew, but he is NOT your responsibility, not is your OLDER sister. \n\nEnjoy your down time, live your life.", "Your sister forgot.  Six hours is a big ask, surely she could have just gone to the appointment and dropped everything else to another time.  Then she might have had more options, like hiring someone.", "NTA don\u2019t over explain just say no you are not available.", "The entire Child Free community salut you! \n\nOne of the biggest complaints CF adults seems to have is that family expect them to baby sit \"because you don't have anything important to do\".", "So the staff should just act like a baby sitter out of the blue? \n\nLooking after other people's children isn't part of their job. \n\nIf someone has a kid they need to make sure a long time in advance to organise a baby sitter.", "Kind of funny how OP had made plans in advance with his friend, but sister waited until the day she needed childcare to ask him.  \n\nSister should be more like her little brother here", "NTA Her poor planning is not your problem. You've had plans in advance, and she tried to tell you last minute to watch HER kid because she \"forgot\" that the daycare was closed, and then she got butthurt because you already had plans? GTFO with that crap. She can't expect you to put your life on pause he isn't your kid. I'm sure you love your nephew very much but he isn't your responsibility. Don't feel bad about saying no.", "NTA \n\nmaybe suggest in future she asks in advance if she wants you to babysit. If you have plans you shouldn\u2019t have to cancel them due to her poor planning", "NTA! People have their own plans: normal parents understand that their usual babysitters won't always be available because they're humans with their own lives, and they adjust accordingly by making other arrangements for babysitting. You're allowed to enjoy your own time and adventures, especially if you've already babysat a number of times. Your sister can make other arrangements/ pay a professional babysitter when you're not available"]}
