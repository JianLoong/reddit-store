My nephew/her brother (18m) has high needs autism and nonverbal except for a few phrases \"fries\" \"car\" \"tv\". \n\nMy sister (their mother) (50f) (yes we're twins) basically had to raise them by herself because her husband/their father (55m) had to work two jobs to support the family so she could stay home for their special needs son. I admit my niece did get the shirt end of the stick so I frequently had her over with me and my husband and kids so she could get the attention she deserved and my sister and BIL could get a break as they already had their hands full with my nephew. He needed constant supervision, had superhuman strength and was difficult to manage during meltdowns especially when he reached puberty (can't go into specifics bc mods would remove my post), and was prone to wandering/running away. My sister and BIL did their best to set aside special time for my niece and it wasn't enough but it was the best they could do. They did eventually place him in a group home two years ago and while it was too little too late for my niece, I sympathize because I thank goodness my kids didn't have any disabilities and could only imagine the guy wrenching decision that was. \n\nMy niece said she considers us more her family then them and went no contact with them after she finished college. She is now engaged to be married and asked my husband to walk her down the aisle. \n\nShe hasn't invited her parents but they found out about it through social media and are devastated at not only being shut out of her life but missing this very important milestone. Their neglect was not intentional, and when they were kids the help and resources special needs families have today were just not available when they were kids. \n\nI've told my niece how much they love her, they did the best they could with the little resources they had and did not purposely have a child with special needs just to make her life miserable, life just handed them a bad hand. I told her they'd never get this experience with her brother and it would mean the world to them to be invited. \n\nShe got very angry with me and threatened me that if I bought it up again she's cut contact with me too and I'd be uninvited. So I dropped it and kept my mouth shut. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673121056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105xvw1/aita_for_encouraging_my_niece_to_forgive_her/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA for expressing your perspective, but YWBTA if you continue to push it.", "My ex husband tells our sons they need to just \u201cget over\u201d the abuse that they suffered at the hands of his ex wife since she isn\u2019t in the pic anymore. That\u2019s not the way feelings work. She has a right to feel what she does. Intentional or not it still deeply hurt her. I think she needs therapy. I couldn\u2019t care less about whether she talks to her parents again or not. She needs to go for her and work through her trauma. If she doesn\u2019t it will affect her long term. Trust me. I know about trauma.", "Your niece has made her boundaries. You need to respect her wishes", "YTA\n\nUnintentional neglect is still neglect. Your sister and BIL went to GREAT lengths to not neglect their disabled son. But they didn't put the same thought into their daughter's situation and she has every reason to be angry about that.", "YTA for minimizing the neglect just because you can see good in your sister and BIL. You weren\u2019t the one neglected, she was. \n\nShe has made her boundary clear. Could she have been nicer? Idk, idk how to convo actually went down, but I\u2019d be extremely mad if someone who watched the neglect tried telling me my parents tried their best knowing full well they didn\u2019t. All I know is that you now don\u2019t need to bring this up again. She will work through her anger at her own pace.", "YTA Unintentional or not, she was neglected. And I've never known anyone to go no contact with their parents unless they had very good reason to. I do think your niece should consider therapy to work through this. NOT because I think she should welcome her parents back into her life, but simply because she obviously had a very difficult childhood. \n\nBut her relationship with her parents should be entirely her decision, and you should support her decision, regardless of whether or not you agree with it. And what you said to her, in all honesty, just comes across as being a bit manipulative.\n\nAlso, a wedding is NEVER the place for a family reunion.", "YTA neglect is neglect is neglect. Feels like you are trying to invalidate her feelings which she is perfectly entitled to. Would drop it now and apologize for doing it in the first place.", "I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say NAH but you are treading the line here and if you push this again, you will squarely be TA.\n\nI get that you want everyone to be happy.   I get that you feel bad for your sister and feel that her neglectful actions were not her fault, she was a victim of circumstance.  And I get that you want a happy hallmark ending, and think that everything could get better now that your nephew is out of the home.  But life doesn't work that way.  Damage doesn't magically go away.  \n\nThe reasons don't change the fact that it WAS neglect, and odds are it went deeper than even you knew.   And your sister and BIL, as parents, are still responsible for how they treated their own daughter.   Your niece suffered as a result of that neglect, and now she is doing what she needs to do in order to protect herself and her future.   She has set boundaries now--and you need to respect them.  If you don't and she goes NC with you, there will be nobody to blame but yourself.", "YTA\n\nHer parents made a choice and now she gets to make hers. Respect it and be supportive.", "I\u2019m sorry. YTA. As an adult your niece may understand what took place in her childhood, but that little girl never could. She grew up without secure attachment and in what sounds like not just a neglectful, but a frightening and stressful home. \n\nYou were very kind to step up and it\u2019s great she had you, but you need to understand that she will hurt deeply from her WHOLE life being taken up by all of this dysfunction that she couldn\u2019t understand. \n\nShe may not understand her worth, advocating for herself, or trust her instincts as she\u2019s been living in survival mode. It may not seem so dire if she\u2019s successful and functional etc\u2026 but it really is. What she does understand is that she needs to set that boundary, and you need to let her protect herself in a way the people who should have earlier never did. I know there were a lot of no one at fault contributors, but the fact remains that\u2019s what happened TO her.\n\nEdit to add: Great to see all the folks who have not had trauma in their lives showing up with N A H! I cannot stress it enough, and you sound like a kind and empathetic person, but YTA and need to drop it. This is not neutral, even though no one caused it. I am speaking from experience.", "YTA  She was so neglected that you had to take care of her and yet you are trying to pretend that her feelings are not valid. You suck.", "It doesn't matter if the neglect was intentional or not - it happened, and your niece was a child at the time and she suffered for it. Now she's got her neglectful parents expecting her to deliver the experience of the wedding of a beloved child, without putting in any of the work to get there. \n\nReconciliation doesn't start with a wedding invitation secured via flying monkey mail. It starts with a sincere apology. I'd strongly suggest that both you and her parents need to re-adjust your thinking from \"it wasn't *really* that bad and plus we couldn't help it\" to \"we fucked up and we need to make it up if we can\". While dropping it means you're NTA this time, that could very easily change.", "YTA \n\nShe felt neglected whether they meant to or not they had two kids not just one. She\u2019s an adult the ship has sailed for them to play mommy and daddy to her she\u2019s grown. All you can do is be there for her but you don\u2019t get to tell her how to feel because she was the child. As a child she still had to go over to your house instead of being at home because mommy and daddy didn\u2019t have time for her that\u2019s what she remembers. Don\u2019t push your opinion and feelings on to her. Respect her feelings and decision on this. If or when she wants to reach out she will until then don\u2019t bring it up.", "YTA. Please don\u2019t ever mention it again. Neglect, intentional or not, is devastating for a child and has lifelong effects. Whether she ever forgives them is entirely her choice and should be guided by her feelings only. Asking her to forgive her neglectful parents because THEY feel bad is completely devaluing her experience.", "YTA. Invalidation is your problem here. Older siblings often are neglected compared to their younger siblings. This is compounded if the older sibling is female and the younger sibling is male. Often times the older sister is put in a caretaker role for siblings that are not special needs at all. So she was already at a disadvantage to be more likely to be neglected. I can\u2019t imagine how much more compounded that would be with a special needs younger sibling. While they may have not seen other ways to circumvent it, it doesn\u2019t mean your niece has to placate her parents at all. Cutting family out of your life is extremely difficult. You go through shame and guilt spirals, constantly questioning yourself. So for someone to do that, it shows extreme dedication. She may change her mind in the future and want to reach out, but you trying to force it is not helpful in anyway. It not only hurts your cause, but more importantly it hurts your niece by passing off her very valid pain as pettiness.", "YTA. It is not up to you to manage their relationship. There may be more to the story than you know.", "YTA- you didn\u2019t suffer the neglect/abuse, she did. Don\u2019t ask her to forgive her abusers/neglecters- that\u2019s solely for her to choose to do or not do.", "YTA although I\u2019m glad you decided not to press the issue once she made sure you could be cut out of her life quickly. \n\nWhat you essentially did is invalidate her feelings and trying to persuade her to forgive her parents for their neglect was wrong. Neglect is neglect. Plain and simple. Apologize to her ASAP and tell your twin she has to live with the consequences, no matter how unintentional it was.", "NAH. \n\nI am operating with the idea that you haven't brought this up with her a lot, and I can appreciate you saying this to her, ONE TIME. \n\nI appreciate her being frustrated and upset by what you said and saying not to ever bring it up again. So now do not bring this topic up again. \n\nAs you said, her parents were in a really tough spot- one I can't imagine and would never want to be in - but the result of that situation and the choices they made mean your niece feels deeply hurt and doesn't want them in her life. I can empathize with them, as you do, and also realize that sometimes, things cannot be fixed. \n\nThanks to you, your niece has a family. I absolutely understand why you felt the need to express to her that her parents are not horrible people, and even reading your post I feel bad for them. But at the end of the day, your niece has to come first, especially because that is not a feeling she ever got from her parents. Being neglected creates a trauma in a child that is hard to overcome, and it doesn't matter the reason behind the neglect. \n\nSo you gave her your perspective, she didn't take it well, so go back and tell her you respect her boundary, will never raise it again, she is safe with you, and you will be there for her wedding, and that if she ever wants to talk about it, you are here for her. Make sure you convey to her how safe she is with you and how much you love her. She needs that.", "NAH\n\nYou have good intentions, but you cannot comprehend the neglect and isolation that she went through, basically being the disposable child.\n\nHer parents chose to put all their efforts into their disabled son and had nothing left to give their daughter.\n\nTheir daughter now has nothing left to give them.\n\nLeave it alone.", "YTA. Specially when you told they will never have this with her brother, you are again making it all about him.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to tell your adult niece how she gets to feel.", "YTA \n\nNeglect is neglect regardless of the intentions, her feelings are valid and if she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with them or want them at the wedding then that\u2019s her decision.\n\nIt would be a shame if you also alienated her by being pushy about it.", "NAH but you will be if you push her on this.\n\nShe's said no. Her wedding isn't the day to try and reintroduce them.", "Soft YTA.\n\nIt would be great to see this family reconciled, but your niece is in extreme pain right now. It's a pain so deep down in the soul that it feels physical. It feels like it might never heal.\n\nYou said that her parents are missing a huge experience but you need to realize something: She feels in her heart of hearts that she missed out on so many parent/child experiences. Dance recitals and baseball games and school awards and first dates and driving lessons and graduation and moving to college. When your niece remembers these things, she sees *you*, not her parents.\n\nThe only thing you can say to her, if you want to stay in her life, is that you love her no matter what, and you'll help her with whatever choice she makes.", "YTA for trying to excuse the neglect of a child", "YTA. You and your husband served as a safe place for her during her neglect. I don't know what magical thinking would suggest that someone who went no contact when they went to college with their parents, would be amendable to inviting them to their wedding YEARS later.\nI am guessing that your niece HAS accessed therapy, because she has established firm boundaries, and as you are learning, is willing to enforce them.\nDo you want to be in her life? Then drop it.", "YTA especially cause I am guessing he hurt her physically and they did nothing from your redacted part", "YTA. You don't get to tell a neglected kid who puts up boundaries that they're wrong. You witnessed it from the outside perspective of an adult. You didn't live the constant heartache of being ignored for a sibling. She gets to decide who has the privileges of a relationship as an adult. Not you. \n\nYou are wrong. So wrong. \n\nNo mention of the parents or you getting her therapy while she was actively being pushed to you for attention as a child. It's great that you stepped in, but she gets to decide who shares her happy moments. She sees you and her uncle as parents. Don't ruin that by trying to force forgiveness on her part. Once you put up boundaries, it's much easier to do it again. Make sure you're standing on her side of the boundary, or you too could find yourself shut out.", "YTA-I\u2019ve been the neglected sibling because of my disabled sister and according to another sister they were neglected because I\u2019m  also disabled. Your making excuses for abuse. Doing the best they could would mean not neglecting her.", "YTA - neglect is neglect. Whether it was intentional or not, she was still neglected. It took them 16yrs to put him in a home. What efforts have they made in the past two years to reconcile with her?", "NAH. I don't think anything you said was out of line, and when she asked you to drop it, you did. Playing devil's advocate is a difficult but necessary role.\n\nEqually, your niece is entitled to her own point of view and to make her own decisions. She clearly feels extremely strongly about it.\n\nI don't think anyone here was out of line and all the YTA responses go way too far.", "YTA. It isn\u2019t your business to interfere with what your niece has decided to do for her mental health. Her parents chose to neglect her in favor of their disabled child. They could have sought help earlier and Chose not to. I\u2019ve had about enough of parents treating one or more of their children like crap because of what the parents want. There\u2019s no excuse for it.", "YTA and you are completely invalidating her very valid feelings. You didn\u2019t live through it, she did. She doesn\u2019t have to have people in her life who spent her life treating her like an afterthought", "NTA.  Your niece needed to hear the reality her parents were faced with.

They missed the majority of her life so why should they start attending now?", "NAH. You mean well, I'm sure, but you don't get to decide for your niece how she gets to feel about being so severely neglected by her parents, even if their reasons for doing so weren't intentionally malicious toward her. If she's still upset, she's perfectly entitled to be.", "NAH. You tried to be a peacemaker but she's obviously not ready for that yet (and may well never be). She's well of age to decide who her \"chosen family\" is going to be.", "YTA. She is entitled to feel the way she does. It's common for siblings to not get the same attention as special needs sblings, but it doesn't sound like she got any attention. In hindsight offering to take the other child to give your sister respite, and time to spend with her daughter might have been an idea. She was neglected and set aside by her parents. That's really hard to accept and it's extremely difficult to forgive. Don't invalidate her feelings.", "YTA. I am/went through this exact situation except my sibling was a problem child.

Neglect is neglect. This was intentional.", "NTA.  But if you bring it up again then YTA.  You get to say your piece on this matter only once.  Do not continue to try to get her to change her mind about whether your niece's parents did all they could or not and whether that was enough for her or not.", "NAH it's a horrible situation all around the board but your niece is still hurting from her childhood it may take some time for her to understand encouraging won't help that much she needs to want a relationship with her parents on her own only thing you can really do is just stay by her side", "YTA. You should be ashamed of yourself for gaslighting her like that. My parents neglected me, and when I went no contact I had family members say the same thing as you. This gaslighting eventually turned into an abusive relationship and I have cut all contact with my entire family. I wouldn't blame her for cutting you out too.\n\nAlso, remember, a wedding is about the couple, not you, your sister and BIL, their son, or anybody else. If you can't focus on them for the wedding, then don't go. Let then focus on their future and not past drama.", "YTA for invalidating her feelings, but you are NTA since you stepped up filled that role in her life. Neglect is neglect and you can't know how things were when you weren't there.", "YTA. Your niece didn't have parents in the normal sense of the word. She didn't have people there to comfort her, to encourage her, or to guide her through childhood into adulthood. She had two people who could financially provide for her needs before she could support herself, but they spent the majority of their time emotionally unavailable while they focused on someone else. Which is why you stepped into a larger role in her life in the first place.\n\nNo amount of good intentions on your sister's part is ever going to change that. No amount of good intentions are going to at all address the trauma this caused your niece that she will carry with her for the rest of her life. And no amount of sympathy you have for your twin is ever going to alleviate your niece's pain, and it absolutely doesn't give you the right to invalidate her lived experience or her thoughts and emotions about it.", "YTA.", "YTA", "NAH but now you know where she stands, leave it alone, don't bring it back up.", "YTA everyone is entitled to their feelings and you trying to invalidate hers by putting it on her that she has to accept and forgive is not ok plus the comment they won\u2019t have this with the son makes it seem like they should just have to settle on having it with her instead. Not at all nice or helpful", "YTA.  You didn't ask her to \"forgive\" her parents for her benefit.  You made it about them and how they'll never get the opportunity with her brother.\n\nForgiveness doesn't mean forgetting and it doesn't mean that you have to let people back into your life.  It means letting go of the negativity and anger.  It's something you do for yourself for your emotional well-being, but it doesn't require that she re-establishes a relationship with them.  None of what you were doing actually considered your niece's own well-being, nor were you actually asking her to consider forgiveness.  All you were doing was trying to guilt her into a relationship with her abusers again.  This is not your circus and not your monkeys.", "NTA- I was in the same exact position when I was younger. My only sibling has disabilities and also had \"super human\" strength. He was dangerous but it took until I was 15 to get him placed in a group home. There just were not options available until he got so violent that we were able to prove to the state government that we were unsafe living with him the. The only reason he finally got placed was because I attempted to run away & wrote a letter to the state. We also got video evidence of his violence.\n\nThere was nothing more my parents could have done. Was I neglected pretty often and do I have trauma from it? Yes of course. But as an adult I am able to look back and understand that they did their absolute best. It is incredibly difficult to get a placement in a group home and people who don't have experience with trying to place a family member don't understand how long those waiting lists are & how low the turnover rate is. \n\nShe is still allowed to have her feelings about it of course. If she doesn't want a relationship with them that is her decision. So I think YWBTA if you continued to push it, as others have said. But I don't think YTA for stating your opinion about it once and then dropping it when asked.\n\nThank you for being her safe haven", "NTA but you\u2019re also right for dropping it. Holding on to that type of resentment and hostility is like drinking poison and expecting it to kill someone else.

Neglect, no matter the reason, is still abuse. \n\nYou did a very AH thing and your niece probably feels like she has no family to turn to, and she\u2019s probably right. I hope that the family she is marrying into shows her the attention she deserves!", "NAH, I think the damage has been done, and while the parents aren't monsters for doing what they did, the impact it had on your niece cannot be repaired. It is a bad situation all around.\n\n>She got very angry with me and threatened me that if I bought it up again she's cut contact with me too and I'd be uninvited.\n\nShe is angry, but unless you were threatening her with not going or something, this reaction is pretty harsh. She holds a lot of anger towards her parents still, and it may be best to suggest some type of therapy or something so she can work through it. She shouldn't be taking it out on you, who was there for her when she needed it. But you should also respect her decision.\n\nYou brought it up, she said no, there's nothing else you can do.

They were doing their best. No one can be perfect in these situations. They did what they felt was right. It\u2019s NOT favoritism to expend so much energy on a special needs child. Many children experience emotional neglect when families go through hard times. Usually it\u2019s not intentional. YOU can intellectually understand this. But your niece grew up FEELING very alone.

My nephew/her brother (18m) has high needs autism and nonverbal except for a few phrases \"fries\" \"car\" \"tv\". \n\nMy sister (their mother) (50f) (yes we're twins) basically had to raise them by herself because her husband/their father (55m) had to work two jobs to support the family so she could stay home for their special needs son. I admit my niece did get the shirt end of the stick so I frequently had her over with me and my husband and kids so she could get the attention she deserved and my sister and BIL could get a break as they already had their hands full with my nephew. He needed constant supervision, had superhuman strength and was difficult to manage during meltdowns especially when he reached puberty (can't go into specifics bc mods would remove my post), and was prone to wandering/running away. My sister and BIL did their best to set aside special time for my niece and it wasn't enough but it was the best they could do. They did eventually place him in a group home two years ago and while it was too little too late for my niece, I sympathize because I thank goodness my kids didn't have any disabilities and could only imagine the guy wrenching decision that was. \n\nMy niece said she considers us more her family then them and went no contact with them after she finished college. She is now engaged to be married and asked my husband to walk her down the aisle. \n\nShe hasn't invited her parents but they found out about it through social media and are devastated at not only being shut out of her life but missing this very important milestone. Their neglect was not intentional, and when they were kids the help and resources special needs families have today were just not available when they were kids. \n\nI've told my niece how much they love her, they did the best they could with the little resources they had and did not purposely have a child with special needs just to make her life miserable, life just handed them a bad hand. I told her they'd never get this experience with her brother and it would mean the world to them to be invited. \n\nShe got very angry with me and threatened me that if I bought it up again she's cut contact with me too and I'd be uninvited. So I dropped it and kept my mouth shut. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They had two children, not one.", "How she feels about her family doesn\u2019t go away nor is it invalid because \u201cit was hard for them\u201d they had two kids and chose to only bond and care for one i\u2019m sure she understands why. what you don\u2019t understand is empathy", "No one feed the troll.\n\nThey are particularly annoying this time of year.", "I don\u2019t see how cutting contact with abusive parents makes her petulant.  Family does not get a free pass at poor behavior simply because they are related to you.", "BTW, I think you and your husband should take her up on her threat.", "Getting a child into a group home is not an easy process. There has to be plenty of due diligence to ensure it's a safe home and he qualifies for such an environment, and then most places have waiting lists. We also know dad was working two jobs - they may not have had the financial means for a full time residence placement.", "If their son was severely mentally disabled, it coukd have been a rather dangerous situation.  You also don't know what kind of medical cocktails had to be administered through out the day either.\n\nThings aren't as simple as you're making them.  They can't just lock their son in the room and forget about him for the day, realistically he needed around the clock care and thats what he got.\n\nYou dont just walk your child into a group home and say bye either.  It takes years of assessments, funding, there has to be a spot open as well.  \n\nI dont think the parents had a choice.  They did what they coukd with what they had available.  Unfortunately that did mean that she didn't get the attention she wanted, needed and deserved.  And that's not okay either \n\nBut if this was the opposite situation, where she got all the attention, and the son was left to his own devices and either got seriously hurt or hurt someone, we would still blame the same parents.\n\nIt'd a lose lose situation across the board no matter what they did", "I meant in terms of CONSCIOUS intent. They intentionally put their energy into the son, but I very much doubt they consciously decided to neglect their daughter that was probably just an unintended consequence.", "That not even true. OP was clear that they did their best to spend individual time with her, but it just wasn\u2019t enough due to circumstances beyond their control. You can\u2019t just drop a violent disabled non verbal child off at a group home and walk away.\n\nThey didn\u2019t choose their circumstances, and they tried their best under the circumstances, even if they fell short. I think that deserves some consideration.", "This is how Reddit works. You judge the stories based on the one side of the person who posted.", "Honestly, I've known a lot of people who were raised in a similar environment, and the only ones who went no contact with their parents also dealt with a lot of abuse on top of it. So I do wonder if there's more to the story that OP is not aware of. Though, regardless of whether or not that is the case, I don't think OP is really trying to see things from their niece's perspective. \n\nAnd yeah, OP is absolutely out of line and if he wants a relationship with his niece then he needs to support her decision either way. The only chance they have of having a relationship in the future is if it's something she decides she wants. And that's exactly how it should be.", "Yeah but trying to point out that the parents should be invited because they won\u2019t get to experience it with the brother is SUPER emotionally manipulative and only for their benefit.  Op didn\u2019t say niece should give them a chance to reconcile\u2026 she just wants them given the special milestone without actually earning it or putting in the hard work to make amends with the niece.", "No it's not blackmaily. Adults who've had enough, want a stable and loving family.  This girl found it with her aunt and uncle. \n\nMy husband is going through something similar. Coming to grips w his childhood. It's incredibly hard to watch and navigate and process. There are some well-meaning people who just push for blanket forgiveness, and it pushes them away from him.  I could have absolutely phrased it better, and for that I admit my wrong. But this aunt has to realize that if her niece doesn't see her as an ally, she's going to end up alienating her from yet another mother figure.  It was a word of caution. \n\nIt's a shitty situation all around. \n\nThe OP needs to understand that while she may love her twin sister, her niece does not.  It doesn't make the OP an AH of a person, but it does make her one, in this situation, if she continues now that the niece has said no to the relationship w her parents. Not every decision is up for a debate.", "Yes.  Healthy relationships mean respecting boundaries.   Nothing blackmail about it.   Conversations can happen but at the end of the day \n\nNo. Means.  No.   Respect it or destroy the trust built up", "Niece didn\u2019t say if you ever disagree with me about anything.  This is specifically about her parents, and it\u2019s a line in the sand, not blackmail.", "Thanks for that. One of my children is disabled, so we will have to make a similar choice. Given finite resources of energy, time and money how do you make things fair when one child clearly needs far more support than the other?\n\nIt's painfully obvious that too many of the people angrily commenting on these types of posts have never raised disabled children, and have never had to make these difficult choices.", "But OP didn\u2019t just mention them she used the fact that they won\u2019t get to experience this with the brother as a reason she should invite them\u2026 that\u2019s kinda still putting their emotions and him above her niece and IMO a really shitty thing to mention and try to use as emotional leverage.", "A single supportive mention, not just any mention. But I agree therapy would be beneficial for the niece. Internalizing anger and trauma is unhealthy and exhausting. She deserves some peace of mind.", "Agreed.  I'm bi polar and had a not so great relationship with ny mother growing up and that level of anger at the mere mention of her parents was extreme.  And I know a thing or two about extreme reactions lol.\n\nI've seen others in therapy group who had their parents beat the hell out of them display less anger so she definitely needs some help, otherwise this will filter down into her relationship with her soon to be spouse and possibly even children if she has any", "that phrasing got me as well...", "People can live almost perfectly normal lives with disabilities. Eg my sister is autistic, but it just makes her a bit particular about some things and she has a couple sensory issues\n\nNot once did I call OP an ableist or evil, but if that's what you pulled from the post, then that is on you\n\nPeople with disabilities can still be healthy. To say that she thanks God that her child weren't born with any disabilities at all just seems a bit much, no?", "\ud83d\udc4f Broken families. Woohoo. GREAT advice!  \ud83d\ude44", "You can have your opinion like I can have mine but to judge them like the way most people have been judging them in the comments especially after knowing the fact they raised two autistic kids which clearly made it very hard for them is in my opinion messed up. Raising special needs kids can take up a lot of your time. And it could\u2019ve made it hard for them to attend to there daughter. At least not in the way that she wanted to be attended to. Which is unfortunate but at the end of the day as what I can read from this blog I feel nobody necessarily in the wrong here. I just feel like her and her parents were put into a very unfortunate situation which made it hard for the both of them.", "Yes, and in this case the OP is the aunt who can see both sides and has stated that she thought the parents did their best.", "my cousin has a disabled sibling. his childhood sucked and now, as an adult, he is still struggling. he suffered neglect and abuse at the hands of his parents and sibling. it's not fair to the other children.  too many kids go NC or LC after growing up in that environment. maybe listen to them so you can do better.", "Agree. Everything she's missed out on with her parents is because their attention had to be on her brother. To use that they will not have this experience with him as an argument for why they should be invited to hers is just tactless.", "That was a poor choice of focus on OP's part, I do agree. I don't think it rises to the point of AH behavior -- I myself am catastrophically prone to \"seeing everyone's pain\" and trying to acknowledge everyone's perspective, so I'd like to give OP the benefit of good intentions, especially since she immediately backed off -- but, as I concurred with another poster was well, the fact that it was in support of her parents was understandably triggering to the niece.\n\nEven with it being understandably triggering, I still think she'd benefit from therapy, just for her own sake. I can speak from experience that carrying resentment and trauma, even when justifiable, is exhausting. The niece deserves emotional peace that she clearly does not currently have.", "You are correct that the supportive nature of it would be more inherently triggering, I do agree.", "Their best obviously wasn't good enough for the neglected child & she is the one who lived through it."]}
