You told her that you were working and were unable to chat, explained to her that you were watching three kids and then had to check on them. Not being able to socialize while working is a pretty basic concept and if your aunt can't understand that, that's a her problem and I'm not sure what \"better explanation\" your mom would have wanted you to give.\n\nKeeping an eye on three kids in a public space is difficult. I can completely understand why you couldn't be pulled in a fourth direction at the same time.", "NTA.\nHonestly, if she didn't understand \"I can't talk, I'm working\" then a few minutes wouldn't have helped either.", "NTA. You were watching (someone else's) kids in a public setting. That deserves your undivided attention (barring anything that can't be avoided.)", "NTA. Fellow Nanny here, you did the right thing. I can count on one hand the amount of times I haven't had to keep my charges in my line of sight at all times. Don't get me wrong here I love them but the eldest of the two has Down Syndrome so she requires a lot more attention and focus then her younger sister, that being said when you are working your working. How about you reach out to her or your mom and ask if they would think it would be appropriate for you to show up at their place of business and try to have a conversation with them when they are busy. It's the same principle.\n\nYou keep doing what your doing OP.", "NTA and as a parent I thank you for giving the kids your full attention. It takes a split second for something bad to happen and if the parents asked where you were and what you were doing, you would be responsible.", "NTA. You told your aunt you were working and being paid to give full attention to the children.", "NTA. I find a lot of adults are wildly entitled and selfish. She should have respected that her family\nMember she came up to was WORKING and couldn\u2019t talk especially considering they were looking after CHILDREN. You could have offered to call her when the children were dropped off back at home which may have eased the situation but I firmly believe they got butthurt when they had no reason to.", "NTA.\n\nAll the Y T A don\u2019t understand that if you\u2019re a nanny and you\u2019re caring for the children you\u2019re paid to watch and care for, you can\u2019t actually give a few minutes to a friend or family member while out in public.\n\nYou\u2019re \u201con the clock\u201d and working, which means that you have to have all your attention on \u201cyour children\u201d because even taking your eye off them for one minute is enough for them to wander off or for a potential kidnapper to abduct them while you\u2019re distracted.\n\nIt has happened for before and it\u2019s usually because the caregiver was distracted or busy with something else that occupied their attention.", "You may have said it in a way that wasn't nice. Ive noticed that if you don't smile and be extra polite that people take offense more. I have to work on smiling and playing by the social rules that other people rely on. That said, there is nothing wrong with the premise of what you said. If you get a chance apologize and let her know that it was nothing personal and you regret that she took it personally.", "NTA-you might want to apologize to your aunt just to smooth things over, but is seems like your boss really doesn\u2019t tolerate any personal things on work time. You\u2019ll have to explain the more fully to her.", "I wish my mom had this attitude when she ran into someone at the grocery store.  Yes, you can actually watch kids and make mouth sounds at the same time. You shouldn't have rushed through your explanation, it paints a picture that you do not care about your aunt at all.

Like keep your eyes on kids and have a brief, pleasant, *polite* conversation?", "YTA - while you didn't have to have a full conversation with your aunt, having a kinder tone would have been more appropriate. I don't think the parents of your nanny children would mind if while watching the kids, you had a 5 min conversation with your aunt explaining the situation.", "YTA. \u201cAunt Jane! It\u2019s so great to see you. I wish I could visit with you now, but I have to give my job my full attention.

When I babysit for short amounts of time, I don't bring my phone and use the home phone, so as not to be distracted (I have adhd). So I don't think u did anything wrong.", "YTA \n\nI completely understand your position, but it sounds like you were unnecessarily rude from the get-go. It would take literally 5 seconds to tell the aunt how much you would love to talk with her but you have to keep your eyeballs on these kids right now, or ask her to follow you around as you take care of the children for a minute.", "NTA", "Kids go missing from parks in less than 30 seconds.

My boss has a rule against personal phone calls while watching her kids. This is basically the same thing.", "She did. She explained exactly what was going on, but the aunt was butthurt at not being #1 priority. Keeping an eye on three active kids at once requires effort. She did exactly right prioritizing watching them over stroking auntie's ego by having a lengthier conversation.", "the OP explained in a comment that his boss is against non-urgent phone calls during working hours", "A lot can happen in five minutes.", "> I explained I am watching three kids and can't talk, because I'm being paid to give them my full attention.\n\nSounds like that's exactly what she did.", "The op's aunt could also have handled it better if you look at it from the perspective that she said she was on working hours and that was her priority at the moment", "No. \n\nShe is being paid to watch the children.

Your mom said you needed to be more clear in your explanation for \"brushing off your aunt.\"\n\n1. You said you couldn't talk as you were working\n\n2. Explained your job was watching 3 children\n\n3. Explained you were being PAID, as part of your job, to give your job 100% of your attention (reasonable, as your job is caring for these children.)\n\nWhat, exactly, was your aunt not understanding? What was unclear? Would your aunt like it or drop everything if you dropped in on her at her job and demanded to chit chat?

One sentence, I\u2019m working and can\u2019t talk, is all the explanation needed. All parents who pay for childcare applaud you today for watching the children carefully!", "NTA. You didn't ignore her you told her you were working and couldn't talk. She ignored you by not respecting that.", "NTA", "A quick hello would be fine but distracting your attention from your charges could have very big consequences if one child hurt themselves, children do fall over all the time but not keeping your attention on them an something happens, you would have to admit that to there parents, your aunt needs to understand how important your job is, don't explain anything to her, an don't go to lunch don't even talk about it, if asked just say she would not respect you being at work you asked several times yet where ignored, so let her come to you", "NTA.  If you were working at a machine or in an office, your aunt would prolly appreciate that you're at work.    You were engaged at work with THREE kids at a play ground.  As a mom, I know exactly how many things can happen to a child while playing, skinned knees, broken arms, or god forbid kidnappings.  \n\nI appreciate your professionalism even if your aunt does not.  She's being very childish for not inviting you to go to lunch bc you were busy at work.  Geez!", "NTA.  Work is work no matter where you are.

Your aunt is a dense asshole for not being understanding that you were busy working.", "You see, I don\u2019t think you are the asshat here and I would get my own petty revenge. Whenever I see her next, when she goes to speak to me I would cut her off right away. \u201cAh, sorry. I\u2019m too rude to hold conversations these days.\u201d And just walk right the F away.

It sucks that we have to cater to people\u2019s impression of us but there it is.", "How was what she said not kind? She apologized to her aunt and explained why she couldn't talk - that's pretty self-explanatory and shouldn't require a five minute conversation to explain.", "She\u2019s already doing three things, unless the kids are conjoined triplets", "Thanks. I'll edit it.", "Never mind anything nefarious, they could perfectly well do a stupid (*all* children, regardless of ability, will try and do a stupid at some point) and jump off the top of the climbing frame and break their nose. \n\nWhich, while on the macroscopic scale is kind of how it goes sometimes, is *incredibly* bad form as a childcare professional. (Source: did a stupid while fully supervised, still lucky I didn't break my nose. Luckily my parents, having been there, knew it was 80% my fault).", "How is this a phone call? I can talk to someone next to me without taking my eyes off of the children.", "I agree. I have children. You can be vigilant and talk at the same time."]}
