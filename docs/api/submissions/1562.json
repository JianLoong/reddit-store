You told her that you were working and were unable to chat, explained to her that you were watching three kids and then had to check on them. Not being able to socialize while working is a pretty basic concept and if your aunt can't understand that, that's a her problem and I'm not sure what \"better explanation\" your mom would have wanted you to give.\n\nKeeping an eye on three kids in a public space is difficult. I can completely understand why you couldn't be pulled in a fourth direction at the same time.", "NTA.\nHonestly, if she didn't understand \"I can't talk, I'm working\" then a few minutes wouldn't have helped either.", "NTA. You were watching (someone else's) kids in a public setting. That deserves your undivided attention (barring anything that can't be avoided.)", "NTA. Fellow Nanny here, you did the right thing. I can count on one hand the amount of times I haven't had to keep my charges in my line of sight at all times. Don't get me wrong here I love them but the eldest of the two has Down Syndrome so she requires a lot more attention and focus then her younger sister, that being said when you are working your working. How about you reach out to her or your mom and ask if they would think it would be appropriate for you to show up at their place of business and try to have a conversation with them when they are busy. It's the same principle.\n\nYou keep doing what your doing OP.", "NTA and as a parent I thank you for giving the kids your full attention. It takes a split second for something bad to happen and if the parents asked where you were and what you were doing, you would be responsible.", "NTA. You told your aunt you were working and being paid to give full attention to the children.", "NTA. I find a lot of adults are wildly entitled and selfish. She should have respected that her family\nMember she came up to was WORKING and couldn\u2019t talk especially considering they were looking after CHILDREN. You could have offered to call her when the children were dropped off back at home which may have eased the situation but I firmly believe they got butthurt when they had no reason to.", "NTA.\n\nAll the Y T A don\u2019t understand that if you\u2019re a nanny and you\u2019re caring for the children you\u2019re paid to watch and care for, you can\u2019t actually give a few minutes to a friend or family member while out in public.\n\nYou\u2019re \u201con the clock\u201d and working, which means that you have to have all your attention on \u201cyour children\u201d because even taking your eye off them for one minute is enough for them to wander off or for a potential kidnapper to abduct them while you\u2019re distracted.\n\nIt has happened for before and it\u2019s usually because the caregiver was distracted or busy with something else that occupied their attention.", "You may have said it in a way that wasn't nice. Ive noticed that if you don't smile and be extra polite that people take offense more. I have to work on smiling and playing by the social rules that other people rely on. That said, there is nothing wrong with the premise of what you said. If you get a chance apologize and let her know that it was nothing personal and you regret that she took it personally.", "NTA-you might want to apologize to your aunt just to smooth things over, but is seems like your boss really doesn\u2019t tolerate any personal things on work time. You\u2019ll have to explain the more fully to her.", "I wish my mom had this attitude when she ran into someone at the grocery store.  Yes, you can actually watch kids and make mouth sounds at the same time. You shouldn't have rushed through your explanation, it paints a picture that you do not care about your aunt at all.

Like keep your eyes on kids and have a brief, pleasant, *polite* conversation?", "YTA - while you didn't have to have a full conversation with your aunt, having a kinder tone would have been more appropriate. I don't think the parents of your nanny children would mind if while watching the kids, you had a 5 min conversation with your aunt explaining the situation.", "YTA. \u201cAunt Jane! It\u2019s so great to see you. I wish I could visit with you now, but I have to give my job my full attention.  Is there a time we can visit?\u201d", "YTA you could have handled that better and could still have talked to your aunt while looking at the kids.", "YTA. Seriously? You couldn\u2019t speak because you were watching children play? I would have disinvited you to brunch too.", "ESH: You could have explained it better and your aunt and mom could be a little bit me understanding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I don't think u did anything wrong.", "YTA \n\nI completely understand your position, but it sounds like you were unnecessarily rude from the get-go.

My boss has a rule against personal phone calls while watching her kids. This is basically the same thing.", "She did. She explained exactly what was going on, but the aunt was butthurt at not being #1 priority. Keeping an eye on three active kids at once requires effort.
