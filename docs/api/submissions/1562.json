You told her that you were working and were unable to chat, explained to her that you were watching three kids and then had to check on them. And you apologized! Not being able to socialize while working is a pretty basic concept and if your aunt can't understand that, that's a her problem and I'm not sure what \"better explanation\" your mom would have wanted you to give.\n\nKeeping an eye on three kids in a public space is difficult.

She should have respected that her family\nMember she came up to was WORKING and couldn\u2019t talk especially considering they were looking after CHILDREN.

If you were working at a machine or in an office, your aunt would prolly appreciate that you're at work.    You were engaged at work with THREE kids at a play ground.  As a mom, I know exactly how many things can happen to a child while playing, skinned knees, broken arms, or god forbid kidnappings.  \n\nI appreciate your professionalism even if your aunt does not.
