I have main custody\u2019s of my two while he has shared custody of his, every other weekend custody agreement. bio mom and mil never liked me my mil has always been someone who was in the middle of my SO previous marriage and had the kids about as often as they did. Now she still has them the weekends we don\u2019t.  When he got with me she was upset because I had kids and mil and ex made it some kind of competition between what we did with my bio kids and what we did all together ( we would have all the kids the same weekend so one weekend four kids next weekend no kids for us. So all our big activities were on the same weekend with all kids. But we would do some activities like neighborhood kids come over and have e bubble party/slip and slid or go to the stream by the house during the week.  Mil always got mad saying we should have gone and picked them up and made a big deal and we stopped doing anything unless all kids were there. \nThen the straw that kinda broke the camels back was when my kids father died. We had to go out of state for funeral and talk about an incredibly hard week for two small kids so me and SO decided to take my kids to an amusement park near by in that state to just give them a moment to maybe have the sadness out of there minds. Before we even returned home mil made a huge deal that we did that without his 2 and that we should never go anywhere on any trips without them ect. And it was just like seriously? There life can\u2019t stop except for the 4days they are with us. Mil and ex take his kids places all the time ( example they went on week vacation 2months ago with ex, they aren\u2019t missing out on experiences. But now my kids only have me and SO ,and are expected to never have experiences unless all 4 there?But we still saved vacation for when all could be present.

That being said my kid birthday is coming up. We\u2019ve planned a 2day mini trip somewhere (we always give the kids a choice between party or trip )But AITAH if we don\u2019t take his kids? They haven\u2019t been wanting to come over so we planned it for just the 4of us? I feel like this is going to cause a huge issue with mil and his family and after 4years of hearing these things I second guess if I am being unfair.

You are correct that life doesn't stop when your other kids aren't there.  And its not like you went on vacation without the other kids before. You were traveling for a funeral and tried to make the best of a bad situation by tacking on a fun activity to help your kids cope with a major loss.\n\nSpeaking as both a stepkid and a stepparent, these relationships are HARD. Anyone who has never been a stepparent cannot truly comprehend just how challenging it is to navigate all of the people involved and their thoughts/feelings about how you should be doing everything under the sun. That's before you even get to the kid themselves!\n\nIts really difficult to navigate being a parent and enforcing rules when the kids don't live with you full time. I saw in another comment that you mentioned that someone thinks you should let things slide for them in term of behavior/consequences so that they will want to visit you more. My husband and I have been there. It's a no win situation that encourages poor behavior.\n\nIf the kids refuse to spend time with you for regularly scheduled life, they don't get to change their minds when you're going somewhere fun. That just teaches them that their relationships with you are disposable and they can decide that you matter only when it's beneficial to them.\n\nEnjoy your trip!", "NTA, though I would make sure you extended an explicit invite to the other kids. Make sure they know they are specifically invited and that they specifically have to turn it down themselves.\n\nYour husband really needs to consider stepping up his custody agreement, by the way. It sounds like ex and MIL are engaging in parental alienation to at least some extent. \n\nOne thing your husband could push for is the right of first refusal when it comes to custody time with the kids - that is, if it's his ex's time with them and she chooses to have someone else watch them, she must ask your husband first. The reason I bring this up is because she seems to be colluding with MIL, which is not working in the best interests of the children.", "NTA. MIL and EX should not have any say in how your family spends its leasure time. Obviously you will be doing more activities with your children than with all the children.

From your replies, I gather that you do everything possible to include your husbands children in everything.
