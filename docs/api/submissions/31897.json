So I took a fake call and pretended I had an emergency and left. Am I the Asshole? I feel like an ass hole but I feel like that is something that should be mentioned at some point in the 2 weeks prior to the date.

This is really something that you must disclose to a date, especially given the severity of the disability. This isn\u2019t a minor issue. This guy needs full time care. Nothing wrong with that but it\u2019s not something everyone is gonna want to sign up for.", "Nta, but id say learn to have the confrontation bc  the only reason you feel the guilt is just ghosting", "NTA. If he was just in a wheelchair I might\u2019ve said your TA but he had very little upper body mobility and even needed you to help feed him.  He should of been honest about his disability before you guys went out", "Obviously the guy should have found time to explain to you his disability, in particular because your chosen date was going to require a level of intimacy that wouldn't be comfortable in almost any setting (e.g., needing to feed him or clean up for him). I feel like it was deceptive of him to not mention this and enable you to make the decision whether you wanted to go out with him.\n\nI'm not really a fan of how you handled standing up your date, even though ultimately he's the major AH. You should have told him straight to his face that he was deceptive and that you were disappointed since you enjoyed the conversation for over 2 weeks and he wasn't honest.\n\nNTA, but next time be honest yourself instead of making up fake excuses when you had plenty of reason to leave the date.", "NTA at all. There is no chance that he didn't know these issues would be a problem, which means he intentionally concealed them from you. He's a bad person.", "Aw the imagery of him with a spilt drink on him being left alone is pretty sad. I would have made sure he got home safe atleast. \n\nNTA though because he did not explain any of this which I understand was an uncomfortable situation for you.", "NTA - You we\u2019re tricked into a date! He is probably self conscious & that\u2019s why he did It but still not okay.", "NTA this is important information that you should know before date. He needs other people to help him eat. He will get similar reaction of his date if he don't tell them about this not everyone can give him the care he wants.", "NTA overall but you are the AH for just getting up and leaving him\u2026. that\u2019s cold & super sad for him just sitting there alone\u2026.", "NTA- Catfishing is not okay!", "NTA\n\nBut be honest with the guy if he reaches out again - not being upfront about something like that is not ok....", "ESH. he should have told you about his condition, regardless to ensure you knew. leaving any date, unless severely provoked\u2014 they\u2019re a creep is an asshole move.", " NTA I\u2019d have done the same.", "You aren't the asshole for no longer wishing to continue to date him, but you are the asshole for how you handled it. What he did was wrong and unacceptable there's no two ways about it, but he's still a human being worthy of the decency to look him in the eyes and tell him straight up. People have gotten way too comfortable just ghosting people and it's done so frequently now and it honestly is really sad in general, like in situations where the other party might be a danger to you then of course it's not wrong, but if you're only doing it to avoid an uncomfortable conversation then it's a dick move. I've had to have that conversation before (not exact sane circumstances but same context) and yeah it sucks, but it's the right thing to do.", "This is really sad. I feel for the guy. Oh man \ud83d\ude14 With that said, NTA. He should have been upfront.", "NTA. Honestly, when you're going on a first date you don't need any explanation for why you ended it and ghosted them or whatever. If you're not the type that could care for someone at the level he clearly needs, you're just not and while it may hurt for him or be hard for him to find someone,  you are not obligated to be that person. It seems like he wanted to strong-arm you into accepting his disability so now you can strong-arm him into accepting your rejection \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Of course it's helpful and respectable to give a reason for why you've lost interest, but he threw you in a highly uncomfortable position by needing what he needed with no heads up, so you did the best you could. I'd imagine fight or flight kicked in and you chose flight.", "ESH because instead of leaving due to a fake call you should have told him what the issue was. How dealing with a handicapped person was not what you expected and he should have said that in his profile, or when you talked/texted him. He should be told that this isn't something he should do. That's if this is even true...", "Nta", "ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have hidden his disability especially since he requires help eating.

My husband is a wheelchair user and was on dating sites prior to meeting me, he never had a problem finding people to date and he was in his wheelchair in every photo. He was very confident and upfront about it. \n\nThis guy isn't doing himself any favors by not presenting his true self and is making everything worse for both himself and his dates. Frankly it's catfishing and I have no idea what he thinks he will get out of it or why he thinks it's advisable. \n\nLying about anything significant about yourself on a dating site is always a bad idea and very unhelpful. Same with people who post photos of themselves from 20 years or 50 pounds ago.\n\nThe ESH part is lying about taking a call and sneaking out (I can't follow if that is what happened?). I'm not a confrontational person either so I kind of get it, and it's certainly at least partly his fault that that happened. Still, I think it would have been a lot more mature on your part to let him know to his face why you were ending the date.", "NTA - that is tough. He should\u2019ve mentioned this and whilst understandable that he didn\u2019t want to if there was to be longevity in the relationship then his partner  must know what they are getting into. No AHs here.", "NTA - I also went on a date with someone who was disabled and that person wasn\u2019t honest.", "NTA, he should have told you about his condition. It's a sad situation for him. It's an uncomfortable one for you to be put in. If he'd been honest and told you ahead of time it wouldn't have been such a shock. It's a major decision to make even with nothing else going on in a normal relationship but add to it something like this and someone is going to make a decision one way or the other. It doesn't make you a bad person to not want to have to deal with something like that.", "NTA. This rises to the level of catfishing in my opinion. This of an important detail that needs to be shared before a date. I hope in the future you can work on standing up for yourself without feeling like you have to fake an emergency, but honestly a lot of the time it\u2019s a safety issue so even that is understandable.", "I agree I don't want It to look like I am judging because of his disability but more the hiding It. To be fair if I knew about his disability prior I wouldn't have gone on the date just because I don't think I would be able to offer what he needs.", "Yes I agree I know I need to work on that! Thank you for the feedback", "Yes I don't think I would have left If It was just the wheelchair depending on how he handled It. It still would have threw me off not telling me prior since we did talk for 2 weeks but I do understand how It could be tough.", "Appreciate the feedback! I will also take your advice, one thing I struggle with is confrontation and I tend to avoid It with the best of my ability. I know I need to work on It & your comment is a good reminder!\n\nShould I send him a message & tell him the truth why I left or just move on? It has been 2 days and he sent me 3 messages but I haven't responded.", "Thank you for the feedback!", "I know that's why I feel like an AH because I feel bad :( I wasn't to worried about him getting home safe as I figured if he got there himself he would have that figured out but after getting feedback I know I could have handled It better by being honest & direct.", "Thanks for the feedback :)", "Thank you for your feedback! I told a couple friends & they said the same thing.", "I didn't just get up & leave! I gave a super valid excuse (Fake excuse I know) but I do agree after reading some other comments I should have just been honest with him instead of making something up.\n\nDo you think It would have been better to not say anything and stay the dinner but not talk again or be honest & leave?", "Okay Thank you!", "Yes I agree I should have been honest! I just hate confrontation so its tough for me :(", "Appreciate your feedback! Like some other comments suggested how would you feel if I was honest & explained why I was upset & decided to leave. Would that still be considered AH move?", "Okay thank you!!", "After reading some other feedback and yours I totally agree that I need to be honest in a situation like this! I struggle with confrontation & It is something I need to work on. Thank you for the feedback I am going to send him a message tomorrow and just be straight forward/honest about why I left & haven't responded!", "Taking a phone call and faking an emergency to leave a bad date is as old as dating and cell phones. It\u2019s hardly ghosting. I\u2019d argue catfishing is worse.", "I know I feel bad too :( I do agree with a lot of other comments that I should have been honest with why I was leaving instead of faking an excuse.", "Yes after getting lots of feedback I agree I should have been honest about the situation!", "She doesn't owe him shit. Poor guy is able to talk someone into a date he can be honest enough to have them not bail. But nobody is owed love or physical attention", "maybe you should volunteer to date him", "She didn\u2019t sneak out, she faked an emergency.", "Don\u2019t feel bad about that. Few people would.", "I understand that guys can be scary and not take \"no\" for an answer (so being direct, while the best policy, is not always possible and requires feeling safe), although I think in the case of this guy there was fairly low risk of that happening. He likely wasn't honest because of fear of rejection or embarrassment. Being direct about what you like and dislike will save a lot of headache down the road in matters of the heart.\n\nI would take the time to respond to him, I generally don't ghost unless someone is a complete AH. I would say something like \"I really enjoyed chatting with you for 2 weeks, but I was very disappointed that you weren't honest with me about your disability.  I understand it might be hard to date, but I would have been more open to continuing if you had just told me what to expect beforehand and given me the choice. I also felt it was invasive to have to feed you on a first date.\n\nI believe in honesty, which is why I wanted to give you this response. I don't think we are a match, in part because I feel deceived. I think you are a good person though, and I wish you all the success in the future.\"\n\nAnd leave it at that. And block him if he continues to persist.", "Well listen. What he did was deceitful, like you said. If anything (you dont have to do this at all), but you can still send him a message and check in on him if he got home safe. And maybe also explain that you felt uncomfortable by him not telling you about his disability. Don't have to tell him that's why you left.\n\nBut atleast he will be told by someone \"hey it wasn't cool\" and maybe he'll think twice before going on another date this way.", "Omg I\u2019m sorry / I read it like your phone rang, so you walked away and didn\u2019t come back! Sorry! \n\nI personally would have stayed the dinner and then not talked again - idk if I would honestly tell him it\u2019s because of the disability because it\u2019s hurtful, truthful but hurtful. He probably knows if he hasn\u2019t reached out either. It\u2019s definitely tricky but he did front differently and should have mentioned it prior", "Understood.\n\nHas he reached out again??", "I can respect that you're willing to look inward and accept criticism without thinking it's a malicious insult to try and make you feel like shit but instead intended as uncomfortable but ultimately valid and constructive criticism, it's a sign of intellectual and emotional maturity. A lot of people will post on this subreddit and others like it and get upset and angry when their less than ideal behavior is called out as such which shows they weren't looking for the truth but instead looking for people to back them up and validate their side of the situation. So good job on being able to accept fault and act to improve now that you're aware of it, it's a skill that is becoming more and more rare these days which is concerning. I hope your conversation with him goes well and that you find success in your future attempts to find a partner. Good luck and have a great rest of your (i'm assuming) night.", "Especially you. Go to the gym", "I did with a woman who did that to me, we had a fun evening and at the end we parted ways kindly and went our separate ways", "Thanks for the confirmation!", "I really appreciate you taking the time to write this out for me!! With some guys It is definitely the not take \"no\" for an answer that I struggle with because of a couple past experiences but with him It was almost the opposite of me not wanting to break his heart even though ghosting probably hurts worse.\n\nOkay I am going to take your advice and send him a message tomorrow! Thanks again for taking the time to help me out :)", "Haha no I would never do that! Yeah I was going to stay that night but I was honestly just so upset after talking for 2 weeks & him not mentioning It at all that I felt like I wasted so much time & energy already. Appreciate the feedback!", "I read it the same way you did. So don\u2019t think you\u2019re alone in how you read it.", "If he does, be honest (for his sake) and tell him, that his handicap is important info that he shouldve been upfront about.\n\nNo doubt he didnt say it before becaise he knew the date would never have happened, but still: not tellibg you before was deceitful..  and a shitty way to get a date..", "He reached out 3 times in the last 2 days since the date", "I'm not talking about that woman, I'm talking about this man from the post who may or may not be a real person", "My English is still not the best. Sorry if It may seem confusing!", "I agree after reading some other comments & yours I am going to send him a message tomorrow! Thank you :)", "So you are a bigot ?", "it doesn't make me a bigot for not wanting to date someone who doesn't disclose that they are disabled to the point where they need to be taken care of by the date. Perhaps if he had been honest, the person would be aware and prepared for his disability instead of surprised and doing a job they didn't sign up for. Also, some people can't handle the responsibility to take care of their partner full time. I can hardly take care of myself, I personally cannot date someone who needs that kind of care. I probably wouldnt ghost them, but it would be super uncomfortable and awkward the entire date.\n\nWhy aren't you married to the disabled person you went on a date with?? oh you mUsT bE a biGoT", "Bigot", "you don't even know what that word means dumbass", "Wow, so you think disabled people are owed sex just because they\u2019re disabled? Super rapey."]}
