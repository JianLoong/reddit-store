You aren\u2019t obligated to give money.", "Imo NTA. She can't expect donations from everyone at work just because she is having a baby, and especially not if she is not friendly towards some of you and you don't have a friendly connection otherwise.", "NTA.  You get what you give.  She is giving nothing as far as any type of positive interaction at the office and therefore you are giving her nothing in return, understandably so.", "NTA You don't owe her anything, much less a gift or money. But asking for donations for a babyshower in your company? That just sounds incredibly unprofessional and inappropriate to me", "NTA. Just because someone has asked it doesn't mean you have to say yes. Also, aren't baby shower gifts usually given by invited guests at a party? Sounds more like a very successful marketing campaign on her end.", "Nta-why would pay for something for someone you don't know...?", "Someone giving you a scowl is not an interpersonal conflict.", "NTA she\u2019s just your co-worker. Baby showers are for friends and family, of which you are neither.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand workplaces that do this kind of thing. Sure it's nice for the receiver, but for everyone else it just feels like a money grab. If a co-worker feels it necessary to give something then they can of their own volition, but everyone shouldn't be roped in to it and feel obligated to contribute. This kind of thing should be between friends and family, and if a specific co-worker falls into one of those two categories then fine. But odds are, most co-workers don't need to be a part of it.", "NTA.\n\nHer horrible attitude aside,  baby showers are for family and friends. *Not work*. I don't understand why companies do this. \n\nI worked for a multi-million-dollar manufacturer in the finance & customer service areas. There were about 100 staff, largely women. And the company wanted to do baby showers for aaaaallllll the pregnant people. \n\nThe first time I refused to donate, I got called in to my manager's office. When asked why I wasn't participating, I said that 1. I don't know her well, 2. I don't *like* what I *do* know of her, and 3. You don't pay me enough to throw away money on a stranger's baby shower. I got the rep of the Scrooge of the office but at least they stopped bothering me.", "NTA I wouldn't donate either.", "NTA. \n\nBaby showers are for family and friends to pay for. Not coworkers", "NTA \n\nNot in the least! \n\nAlso maybe a mass email in the future suggesting that all future events that are asking for financial donations be discussed before sending emails requesting money. \nHope this helps.", "NTA. Who sent this mass email? Thats weird in itself. And NTA. You dont owe her anything. I thought baby showers were for friends and family, not co workers you dont like", "NTA", "Ok, so NTA, but seriously, donate $5 so that people know you didn\u2019t stiff her.

Why should you? It is not an obligation and she is not a friend.", "NAH but I encourage you to practice assuming positive intent. She hasn't been mean to you. She has RBF and possibly is just not an outgoing person. This is evidenced by others not getting positive interactions out of her.

Just ugh.", "My work will do something like this for special occasions, but it's always along the lines of, \"anyone who wants to contribute give funds to so-and-so\" and then there is no track kept of who donated and who didn't, the gift(s) are just from the team in general. No sense of obligation at all. And a card passed around that everyone signs whether they donated or not.", "NTA, baby showers are BS anyway. Just ignore or politely decline by responding to the email.", "Info: Do you work at the sort of company where this will be a big deal?\n\nIf it's going to cause you grief, just donate $10.

You have no obligation to donate. I had that happen to me on a few occasions. The first was my first job out of college, at a family owned business. For our holiday party they were asking for donations to their favorite charity (a religious one I didn\u2019t agree with) in lieu of charging us for attending. I just didn\u2019t go. The second was a job I had after just completing my masters. They asked me to donate to a woman\u2019s baby gift who was already on leave before I started. I felt guilty and donated that time since I would have been the only person on the team who didn\u2019t.", "Donate/give her a Miss Manners book. I kid I kid, NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.   I worked in a huge office before I retired, and the amount of shit stuff they wanted us to contribute to was amazing.  We had appeals for holiday giving, baby showers, retirement gifting, birthday parties, help us send our little Susie Q to cheerleading camp ( ! ), help someone\u2019s church out, give to various  politicalized causes, etc.   I had to draw the line somewhere.  My line was that if I went out to lunch with a person, I would consider donating, unless it was something that I utterly didn\u2019t agree with, I.e.  a political view.   I think using the workplace to fund personal events actually uncalled for.   I definitely had \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d by the time I got out of there.", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t like her, you don\u2019t know her, she isn\u2019t friend or family.

It gets very pricey being expected to donate to these things for every single person in your social and work lives, especially for those only ever on the giving end and not the receiving end.\n\nThis who want to participate can, those who don\u2019t shouldn\u2019t be expected to.", "NTA why on earth would you give money to anyone who treats you like crap? If anyone has a problem tell them they are free to donate double but you don\u2019t give your hard earned money to bullies and assholes.", "NTA - no one is entitled to your money. She\u2019s frosty to you, oh too bad your wallets empty for her.", "Hmmm you don't have to give, but your reasoning is kind off flimsy. So i'm going tentative YTA\n\nSo she doesn't always just smile when people engage with her\n\nShe doesn't smile when you interrupt her work to chat\n\nAnd somehow that's why you don't want to contribute.\n\n\nAs in, she's not a chatty Kathy and you take offence to that.\n\nYou are so close to saying: You'd look pretty if you smiled.", "Oh you know damn well that multi million dollar company isn't giving a cent to her too  \n\n\nCalling *you* Scrooge and not them is rich"]}
