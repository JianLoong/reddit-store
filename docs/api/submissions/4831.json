I don\u2019t feel like I have any business parading as a native and then having to answer questions about their culture and things like that which I am only educated on of from an outsiders perspective. \n\nObviously if your mom is both culturally and ethnically South African then literally none of this applies to you, but still potentially using a more specific term like saying Zulu might make them think twice about saying something.", "NTA.

I\u2019m French and African. \n\nTeacher: no. You\u2019re white. You can be French and English.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for assuming you can\u2019t be African because you\u2019re white. And it makes sense your name is French since your dad was French and most of Africa was settled by the French! \ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udd2d\n\nAll the more reason to let your kids introduce their African culture also!! They can teach the kids in their class (and school admins too lol) that culture isn\u2019t defined by skin color. Lol that\u2019s archaic!\n\nI knew a girl that was Italian but had pale skin and red hair. Because of how she looks, she can\u2019t actually be a Italian! So does she need to identify as Irish then?? (I\u2019m stereotyping here) Lol then what about someone who\u2019s Irish with darker skin, brown eyes and brown hair, are they then Italian?\n\nPeople are ridiculous!", "Went to a Mexican restaurant recently and noticed most employees were speaking Spanish to each other. Placed my order, then another lady started making my burrito. She looked white so I said something to her in English and she looked confused. A few moments later she turned to another coworker and was speaking fluent Spanish. My bad for assuming she wasn\u2019t Mexican!", "Tell the teach your mother is  South African and ask her what it makes you.", "NTA This is a prime, teachable moment for this teacher. She needs to be taught that not everyone in/from Africa have dark skin. You were raised mostly in South Africa (& it seems you were born there too, but I might be mistaken on that part as you didn\u2019t specify) & that means that you are, indeed, African. You can educate her in a respectful way, but please, do not let this slide.", "NTA, fellow South African here. born and raised here too.\n\n koeksusters... ooofff those are so delicious...  I need to go out and get some now the craving is real real... and some biltong!", "Nta if shes going off your name alone shes suggesting that africans cant have french names lol", "WTF, how can she decide how you describe yourself ?", "NTA\nThis is 1) really inappropriate 2) a huge missed opportunity for the kids to try food from someone who grew up somewhere else\n\nWould she tell a white passing mixed race child that they couldn\u2019t identify with their non-white half? That would be both horrible and a lawsuit. Honestly I would say something to the school before she tells something fucked up to a child about their identity", "NTA. Her ignorance is exactly why you should fight this.", "Gross.  I'm white and my husband is Indian.  He grew up in Nigeria though and craves Nigerian food quite often.  So far, people have assumed that our kids are Latino, Middle Eastern, and Native American. You can't tell where someone is from by looking at them.", "NTA their ignorance is showing", "NTA: I'd be filing a complaint.", "NTA \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffcDon\u2019t email the teacher back, this is a sit down conversation. \n\nThe teacher is ignorant and has a lot to learn. This person will definitely feel ashamed, but what you have to tell the teacher is something that is super important and I think it is important that she actually understands what you are saying. An email will not capture this. \n\nFurther, you want to know their reaction to ensure you both ended on a cordial note. \n\nSet up a meeting asap after or before school. It\u2019s worth it to talk to the teacher directly.", "This is simple. You don\u2019t even need to complain (unless the next step doesn\u2019t go well). Email the teacher back and say \u201cI was born and raised in South Africa and I do not appreciate the lecture on how to speak about my heritage and home country. As I previously explained, we will be providing traditional dishes that represent both my African and French cultures. Looking forward to sharing my heritage!\u201d\n\nIf the teacher persists with an attitude, then involve administration.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, go report that racist teacher. She should not be that ignorant if she's a teacher.", "NTA\n\nFollowing her logic, no Black person could be from any country other than Africa. Racist AF.", "NTA and the teacher can fuck off", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of a post that was made a long time ago about a guy who was white and was born and raised in Jamaica.  He had a Jamaican accent then went to the United States for university.  He got told by some other students who were white that he can't have a Jamaican accent because he is white.  He said that he was born and raised in Jamaica.  They didn't believe him and demanded proof.  So he showed them his ID and..... they backed off because they made stereotype, racist assumptions.\n\nSame thing applies here, the teacher is making racist assumptions.", "NTA. The teacher is being presumptuous, and there are perfectly polite ways to address it that aren\u2019t combative. \n\n\u201cActually, I grew up in South Africa, and my culture plays a big role in how I raise my girls. I\u2019d hate them to miss the opportunity to share their full heritage with their classmates, and for their classmates to miss the opportunity to learn something new about an incredibly diverse country.\u201d\n\nI would say something like this, leave it at that, and take the dishes you had planned on taking.", "Nta\u2026but is this the hill you want to die on? If it were me, I\u2019d just make my life easier for my kids and for me and make the white dessert. Your girls are too young to appreciate the injustice. Your time will come as they get older. Mark my words.  Hopefully it will be at the right time to be a meaningful learning moment for all the people involved regardless of their race.", "NTA. Just curious if she tells black British children to bring in traditional African dishes.", "NTA but I think you would be better to say South African to make it clear you are referring to the country you are from rather than the continent", "Hello fellow saffa \nAgreeing with everyone else - you\u2019re African, send them the lekker koeksisters!! (Is the plaited syrupy kind or the cape coconut type? \ud83e\udd24)\n\nThought I\u2019d cheer you up with a silly story of my own. Moved here to the UK from SA 6 years ago with my 2 daughters. We too are white South Africans and my daughters battled to settle at school. Often got the usual stupid questions, you know: why aren\u2019t you black, did you live in a mud hit, did you have lions in the back yard? Bless them. \nUntil one day we were walking around B&M and a gent from Zim heard our accents and started chatting. After he leaves my daughter asks is he from Zimbabwe? Me: yes; my incredibly naive daughter: why isn\u2019t he black? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "I don't think I've ever heard a South African person refer to themselves as African. They all say South African. \n\nI could be wrong. I'm half South African, but was raised in North America so I don't know a ton of South Africans.\n\nEdit: NTA, because your ethnic background isn't always indicative of your nationality, and even if it were, the teacher is just being ignorant and rude. Plenty of different ways to be from somewhere.", "I'm confused.  If you are South African, why aren't you saying that you are South African?  Africa is a continent with a huge number of diverse cultures.  There is no one African culture.  Every person I've know from Africa, identifies their heritage and culture by the country they come from.  You may be African, but that says absolutely nothing about your culture.  You are very specific about the French side of things, instead of just saying you are European, so why are you doing something else with your South African side?", "NTA- Talk to the teacher and if she still doesn't get the fact that genetics can be pretty wild then she's just ignorant. Your  half French and half South African you just happen you be white passing, not your fault. Your not appropriating a culture your trying to represent your culture that you spent 18 years living and are very proud of.", "nta by denying your identity and culture you are also denying your children half of there identity and culture. be proud of it so they can be proud of it.", "If white South Africans aren't Africans, white Americans aren't Americans either.", "INFO:  Why can\u2019t you say \u201cSouth African\u201d?  It would be less confusing, wouldn\u2019t it?", "Maybe there are Black South African students", "~~To be clear, I think the teacher is wrong.  Simple google would have assisted her in how she framed her thoughts. So NTA~~\n\nINFO did you say African or South African? and did you make this distinction to the teacher?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a difference between being African and South African.\n\nSouth African is your nationality European /white is your race/heritage. Inclusive of the related European ethnic groups Your heritage isn\u2019t African, it simply includes ppl who settled in South Africa.\n\nAfricans are persons who are Bantu/Zulu/ Igbo/Amazigh etc and all the other indigenous persons of that continent\n\nThe desserts you mention are from my observation, Afrikaner which I understand to be the white Dutch settlers of South Africa.", "Charlize Theron is SOUTH AFRICAN. She is white. I may be wrong, but wasn\u2019t it colonized by the Dutch, so yes there are white people that were born and raised there.", "AFRICA IS A WHOLE A$$ CONTINENT.  FULL OF PEOPLE OF VARYING SHADES AND ETHNICITIES.  nta", "NTA, file a complaint against the teacher. A guest guidance counselor once accused my kid of being a liar when he said he was half Arab. Well my husband (the Arab) paid her a visit the next day. Fortunately another teacher (who knew us) had already heard what she said and had informed the guest guidance counselor she owed my kid an apology. Ignorance amongst our children\u2019s educators should NEVER be tolerated.", "Has the teacher not seen mean girls? What an idiot. NTA", "NTA. You should respond to her email with a good dose of education. You don\u2019t have to get rude or lodge a formal complaint\u2026yet, but you can point out how wrong her assumptions are and insist that you still make something from your African heritage.", "I'd be putting in a complaint and telling the principle to make sure the teachers in a \"multicultural school\" are aware of the differnce between race, nationality and culture... scary this woman is teaching children", "NTA. Go and raise hell for your culture. It is clear that the teacher in question does not respect your heritage and is quick to make assumptions based on appearances, which is terribly wrong. Your children will not be bullied into thinking that they are not part African. That teacher needs not only a history lesson, but proper education on how to accept different cultures, especially at an international school.", "Teacher's an asshole. This shit doesn't get to go only 1 way. That's racist as hell.", "Isn\u2019t school supposed to be about learning? What\u2019s the point of this assignment if you don\u2019t share your truth? What kind of teacher doesn\u2019t know there are light skinned Africans??", "Ancestral heritage, cultural heritage, and geographic heritage.  I don\u2019t think this teacher needs to be intentionally demeaned, but she definitely needs to be corrected.

Literally the but you're white comment in every country I have ever lived.", "After reading your comment I\u2019m tempted to change my judgement.

To be honest as soon as I read the title I assumed you were a white South African.\n\nIt\u2019s technically true, you are as African as a Bantu in that you were born on the continent of Africa\u2026 But in your home country you would have been on the privileged end of a systemic oppression of people the government legally classified as African. In that sense it\u2019s actually insulting the way you refer to it.\n\nThe Koeksister is believed to have originated from the dutch settlers.  Wouldn\u2019t Afrikaner be the more appropriate terminology there?", "No there aren't. All white people on the entire continent of Africa are located on the southern tip of Africa. /s"]}
