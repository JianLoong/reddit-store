I don\u2019t feel like I have any business parading as a native and then having to answer questions about their culture and things like that which I am only educated on of from an outsiders perspective. \n\nObviously if your mom is both culturally and ethnically South African then literally none of this applies to you, but still potentially using a more specific term like saying Zulu might make them think twice about saying something.", "NTA.

We are not African by heritage, we don't follow any of the African tribes' cultural heritage, we didn't have any of the struggles Africans have faced for centuries, we are European in our customs and culture and even food.\n\nWe follow European customs and culture (and even language, though that is up for argument), not African, even in South Africa.\n\nOP is white South African, she can claim Afrikaans heritage, but not African.\n\nSource: White South African living in South Africa.\n\nEdited to add: See also Elon Musk. He is NOT African American, he is Apartheid American (or more correctly, Apartheid Canadian, since his family fled South Africa when power transitioned to black rule and many white racist fled to other countries rather than live under black rule).\n\nEdited again: It's like a white American going overseas and claiming Native American culture in another country as their heritage - unless you grew up in it, was born into it and raised in it and learned it by right of birth, you are an American, not a Native American.", "Get absolutely fucked.", "Thank you. I feel like the NTA answers here are either apartheid apologists or people who don't know the racist history of South Africa.", "That\u2019s wild! Like your skin color doesn\u2019t determine where you grew up, where you\u2019re parents decided to move, if you were in the system and ended up with a family from another culture. There are some many reasons a child would be raised in a country that\u2019s \u201cunexpected\u201d (for lack of a better word) for their skin color. It\u2019s absolute bullshit (and racist) that people would question it.", "His mom is Xhosa. He is African by right of birth and being raised as an African with African (Xhosa) culture, heritage, history, language and food.", "I\u2019d like to say youthful ignorance is bliss but I\u2019m guessing these weren\u2019t kids at school?", "Yes, I know this. Both have been on their respective adopted continents for 400-500 years. But nobody gets weird about saying that, like, Tom Hanks is an American. He is. He's not an indigenous American, but he's an American because he's from here.", "Most people do. If there's a Greek kid in the class they probably said they're bringing Greek food not European food. A Japanese kid would say they're bringing Japanese food not Asian food.\n\nOP is African and European but the European nationality got called by country (French) and the African by continent. If doing both by country will make it clearer to the teacher why not do it that way?", "Yeah, it's exactly like that, except for all the ways in which South Africa's history differs from the USA's and North America's differs from Africa's.", "The idea that Europeans can colonize a country and suddenly claim to identify as such is jacked. The fact that it is widely excepted by white people is jacked. The colonized mindset needs to fucking die. White people in Africa are European and do not belong there, period. No one talks about Africa with white people in mind. Stop being so fucking obtuse. White people in South Africa literally other themselves from actual Africans, and you idiots still allow them to claim a name that doesn\u2019t belong to them. All of you can fuck right off. She is a white woman. A colonizer. An outsider. Other. It\u2019s not a hard concept to understand, but while people are always going to white people\ud83d\ude44 weirdos\n\nYou also need a better definition of what illiterate is.", "I also didn\u2019t literally say what you claim I said. Do better with words. You literally started a rebuttal with something I literally didn\u2019t say. Idiot.", "Is there a reason you said African rather than South African or Afrikaner, if the latter is accurate, while you said French instead of European? At least in the States, conflating Africa with a country is a pretty big red flag.", "[deleted]", "What teachable moment? This wasn't about a history lesson, it was a party which the teacher said to bring a desert from your culture. There's no moment to teach. The teacher quite litterally is saying 'you're not black enough to be African.' The only \"teachable\" moment is for the teacher to shut up about ethnicity. You could be white as snow and raised by 1st generation immigrants from Africa for all the teacher knows.\n\n\nPerfect example, my aunt's late husband's adoptive dad is as white as it gets, but was adopted by a Native American tribe, and actively participated in said tribe. Would it be wrong to tell him that the culture he was adopted into is not his culture purely based on the color of his skin?\n\n\nThis teacher deserves to be reported", "Still doesn't mean the teacher can say she isn't African. You wouldn't say to an African American that they can't call themselves American, because they look like an African.", "I'm shocked a teacher from the remnants of one of the largest colonial empires is so blind to all of this. She must know at least a little about British history no?", "The teachable moment here is realizing that white people can be african and letting her cook whatever she wants from her culture.", "Coming from an African, this comment was unnecessary", "I'm not sure teaching 8 year olds that their heritage is evil African is the best idea. \n\nThat said OP is absolutely entitled to consider themself an African.", "To be honest, I only became hyper aware of my race when I moved to the US for college. Obviously I'm not blind. As a black woman, I see color and racism still exists in my country. But, it felt like we faced more issues of classism + colorism (save for one region that is notoriously racist.)\n\nAt home, we all had similar backgrounds, cultural upbringings and accents even if we were different races. And, for the most part, there was no stark difference in our shared experiences (unless you were rich.)\n\nBut, when I moved, for the first time in my life, people saw me as my race first.  I was just 17 and it was scary. I looked young for my age so I didn't get it as bad as my friends, but we could tell people of other races were always on their guard around us. People also often treated us harshly instead of like the harmless, dumb, often scared kids that we were. In turn, we had to put up our defenses. It was surreal and made me sad.", "I\u2019m from the West coast, I when I heard an Asian girl with a New Jersey accent,  my mind just couldn\u2019t make the connection!  And don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t expect all Asians to have an accent, but the New Jersey thing blew my mind.", "She\u2019s biracial \nHere you go: https://youtu.be/kluWNnt8W-w", "No, but they can certainly call themselves _American_.  Similary somebody from Africa who moves to the UK can call themselves African.", "The dessert she mentioned is an Afrikaner dish but the I don't believe it makes a difference either way", "How is the similarity the same when Americaness was based off whiteness? Were white people afraid to call themselves American bc of the association to black, or native people during segregation? Because you wouldn't find white afrikaners calling identifying as African during apartheid.", "It's racism to point out that white south Africans are not culturally native Africans when they made that distinction first?", "It's not racist but nice try \ud83e\udd23", "This like my white friend who was born in Hawaii and called herself Hawaiian in high school. And even though we were in a high school in California almost all of my group of friends said, 'nope, you are not Hawaiian, stop saying that' because we knew that being born in Hawaii and being Hawaiian are two different things. I'm Mexican but I don't dress up in indigenous clothing to dance indigenous dances on holidays because I'm not indigenous and I dont pretend to be.\n\nOP could have said she's South African and I'm sure a teacher in England would be ok with OP sharing her South African experience.", "This should be pinned. Was looking to see what another white South Africans opinion was.", "The conversations I've had with people who insist I am European and should go back to Europe has yet to answer me which part of Europe I should go to as my family had been in South Africa for about 300 years. My ancestry is a fun read.", "We're talking about the names of countries within continents.", "But she didn\u2019t colonize anything, she was born in the continent of Africa specifically in South Africa. To her that\u2019s her heritage. That\u2019s where she grew up. She\u2019s allowed to bring a dish from a culture and place in which she grew up in. Also I used the word illiterate bc other words I wanted to you would get me banned again and I don\u2019t want that to happen. Goodnight", "Literally was used as and example of what you basically said but in other words. I didn\u2019t start a rebuttal. What you said make no sense what so ever.", "Maybe because OP is living in UK, where everyone is European, so she has to specify where specifically in Europe? That\u2019s just my guess", "Thank you, was looking through all the comments and while yes technically African, specifying French over European seemed like something that wasn\u2019t explained.", "It's an emotive and political word in my country. So is indigenous. Quite fraught as a topic these days.", "Voluntary adoption and colinialisation by violence are worlds apart.\n\nIn fact, colonialist erase indigenous cultures, so the dad's case is quite the reverse.\n\nOP might feel annoyed, but in the greater context, she is not an oppressed party. \n\nEvery moment is the right moment to explain how racism works in an age appropriate manner. That the cultural dish of the OP is of a Dutch origin, and why it has become African.", "Exactly - you also couldn't call someone descended from the American colonists or immigrants \"Americans\" by that logic, since they aren't native to the continent and in fact oppressed (and continue to oppress) the native population.\n\nCultural semantics, perhaps unfortunately, aren't dependent on how much harm your people have caused. \n\nSo OP, like Elon Musk and the protagonist of Mean Girls, is South African.", "Nice to see African solidarity with OP. But not all are of the same mind of course.\n\nSubstance over form. Teacher did pass poor job, but sentiment against colonialisation is not wrong IMO.", "There's a dermatologist named Dr. David Lim who is Australian. He looks Chinese and speaks with a Crocodile Dundee Australian accent.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bCSptjnwIiw\n\nThe weird thing is that I have a very weird dichotomy in my concept of Chinese Americans.
