Their teacher emailed me back saying that I couldn't have an African heritage because I'm white and would need to bring something else. In the email, a number of English cakes were suggested instead. She then went on in the email to say that I shouldn't describe myself as being African, as it minimises the struggles genuine Africans go through.\n\nIf I'm honest, it's annoyed me.

Maybe she will learn something? It could be a good opportunity for the class to learn not to make assumptions on looks vs. race.", "NTA, and further more, I'd argue that educating the kids that you can be from any racial background and still part of a culture can only be a good thing for acceptance, integration, and embracing rather than pigeonholing differences.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher sounds is TA here.  Who is the teacher to tell you what you are and what you aren't? \n\nWhy are they trying to minimize half of your family heritage and trying to eliminate your entire childhood?  That sounds very demeaning and it's flat out wrong.  The teacher is trying to eliminate your reality.  She's trying to conflate two things:  your existence as a person that grew up in South Africa and the evils of apartheid and the European colonization of the continent (I am assuming here).", "NTA - Please do complain about this. She made assumptions about you and stereotyped you just because of how you look. It\u2019s at the very least ignorant and offensive (and at worst blatantly racist), and she might need some form of sensitivity training for it.\n\nYou are African. That\u2019s just a fact.

I have many white south African friends. They all say they are South African though and don't have this issue.", "NTA.\n\nThere's a great lesson here for kids: Not all people from Africa are black.

If they learn that Africa has diversity too, they might have a better understanding about the world.", "NTA  Your birth certificate says otherwise.

NTA and take it further, and show them just how ignorant they are.", "NTA The teacher is kind of ignorant to assume someone\u2019s race based on how they look. \n\nI\u2019m just curious (not that this changes my opinion) was your mom a white South African? As I understand it there are specific terms to differentiate different ethnic groups who are from South Africa correct? Like Africaners? Idk where this teacher is from but I could see this being an ongoing issue if you\u2019re in America for example where people don\u2019t really understand that a lot of South Africans are culturally African but ethnically Dutch. Maybe using those specific terms might be helpful in the future?\n\nIdk I\u2019m in America and people are weird about race and heritage. I\u2019m from a small island and it\u2019s so hard for people to understand that I\u2019m from this island and identify with the culture but am ethnically not native (since it appears that I could be). I always feel weird when people assume I am a native of that island and I always correct them and tell them it\u2019s like saying a white person from Idaho is Native American just because they were born and raised there. I don\u2019t feel like I have any business parading as a native and then having to answer questions about their culture and things like that which I am only educated on of from an outsiders perspective. \n\nObviously if your mom is both culturally and ethnically South African then literally none of this applies to you, but still potentially using a more specific term like saying Zulu might make them think twice about saying something.", "NTA. Teacher is conflating African with skin color. You need to escalate this at the school.", "NTA. Report the teacher for minimizing your background. \n\n\u201cGenuine African\u201d, implying you\u2019re not, is incredibly offensive.", "NTA. Oh my word\u2026 this teacher needs an education. Please report to the teachers administration and/or school board, etc.", "I think you are NTA and this could be a learning experience for the students, and evidently the ignorant teacher, but I also think it would be good to gradually make your daughters aware of some of the dark history that led to RSA having a sizeable, relatively affluent white population.  Since they're 8 Im not sure they need to know much now, but you can explain that there are many groups in Africa and the koeksister comes from Afrikaner people who have European origins, not from a native African culture", "NTA\n\nI can't stand when people do this. If your bio parent is Italian (for example) and you live in Italy.... You're Italian. Same goes for anyone else. If anyone has an issue with that, they can go pound sand.", "NTA. You were born in South Africa. You are connected and proud to be of african heritage. You are african.", "NTA, you\u2019re African. Definitely have witnessed my mixed race South African bestie get told to her face by many Americans that she isn\u2019t African because she isn\u2019t 100% black. Same thing happens to my North African friends.", "You should say something because she is, by extension, denying your children *their* African heritage.", "NTA, and honestly, all the more reason to educate everyone in the classroom.", "Racism is horrible, especially if it's spewed with conviction as by this teacher.\n\nHave a good look at where you live. If this line of racist thinking hasn't permeated through the whole school yet, launch a complaint in an effort to stomp it out before it gets worse. If it already has, consider what environment you want to raise your children in.", "NTA- it's bad enough the teacher assumed white meant not African. It's worse that she decided to chastise and lecture you about how you shouldn't call yourself African because it minimizes the struggle of \"real\" Africans.
