To give you some context, I funded everything (plane tickets, accommodation, food, tours, airport transfers, pocket money, and transportation) on this trip because she has never worked and she's separated from my Dad who could've given her money for the trip.

My Mom was trying to ask this vendor lady if the item she was holding was made of coconut. The vendor lady wasn't very smiley to begin with and she was explaining what it was but in her native language. I tried to ask her a second time by simplifying my English and smiling while I asked. I made sure my tone was friendly and not mocking in any way. She looked blankly at me and turned around to go back inside her store. She came back 5 seconds later and was looking away, not minding us. I think at that point she was done. She didn't want to try to communicate in English. Which I have no problem with whatsoever. As I said, I should've done my research for phrases. That's on me.\n\nBut for some reason, my Mom had this Mandela effect experience where she says the vendor looked very mad and that she was fuming. The woman did not have that look on her face at all. She was calm and I would know that because I was standing close to her and I was staring directly at her before and after she went inside her store. My Mom wasn't wearing her very thick glasses and was a bit far from us when she accused me of angering the vendor, so it really makes sense that everything is all in her head.\n\nAll throughout that day, my Mom kept bringing up how I had made the vendor lady mad because it seemed like I was laughing at her face... that I was insulting her. I would've defended myself had we not been part of a tour. I didn't want to embarrass myself or her, plus I was too busy looking for stuff to take home. So I kept quiet.\n\nWhen we got to the hotel, she arrogantly brought it up again. I explained what had really happened but she just wouldn't take my side. I lost it at that point. I asked why she was being mean to me all day when all I'd done was try to help her ask the vendor about the item. I also asked her why she won't stop when it was clearly making me upset at the market. We argued more but when she got tired, she stopped talking. The plane ride back home wasn't too awkward but deep inside I was still very mad because she had never apologized.\n\nBefore this trip, I had told her that we would spend her birthday next year in a different Southeast Asian country. But seeing how she had bullied me on this trip, I don't think I want to EVER try and go on another trip with her.\n\nSo... AITA?

But that's not necessarily relevant to the argument with you and your mom because maybe neither of you were in a position to know for sure).\n\nWithout knowing what your mom said to you or how it's really hard to tell if she was actually being mean to you, or just stressing about the miscommunication.\n\nTravelling with people you don't gel with in terms of your travel style is really stressful, so I get why you want to go for no more trips together.

I'm sad that we don't gel together, but it's just fact.", "Exactly. Thank you so much for your advice.", "Yeah that makes absolute sense. The only problem is I'm also building my travel portfolio, so I will need to travel next year, too \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut I agree the blunt response is more mature, but I'm going to have to find a way to work around that without hurting her feelings.

I don't understand why she thinks bringing it up will resolve things. \n\nThat's a good idea. But I think I'll have to pass. She has been this way on smaller local getaways, too.

It's just that we don't argue as much and it really took a lot of resources, energy, and loss of sleep to make this happen. I just wanted a bit of appreciation. \n\nWe're also Asians, btw. I watch a lot of series and movies from the country we visited, so I am aware of their culture. Just not so much their language. You are right with her being annoyed though. That was my fault for not trying to speak in her language.\n\nShe cursed at me in our native Southeast Asian language in a very, very bad way. She has cursed at me like that before, but this was just different as I was purely innocent and she was accusing me of something that was in her head. \n\nIt's travelling with her that's exhausting overall. I was travelling with a 60-year-old child who never bothered to do any research, kept asking me questions that could've been answered by a Google search because I clearly wouldn't know the answer, and was just waiting on me to resolve the problems we encountered. It was horrible. I might as well have taken a toddler with me. \n\nMy grudge comes from the fact that we argued about it again today because she can't and won't stop bringing it up. It's like she wants to see me explode. And mind you, I am a very, very calm person.", "Yeah I think so, too.

We should probably visit english-speaking places instead.\n\nNope!

Tricky, but we don't know her so we can hardly help. \n\nYou can find something else to do for her birthday.

With inflation and all, it makes it such a burden to have to pay for her. That argument makes a lot of sense.

The most frustrated I've ever been and this person is more than twice my age...\n\nWe really should never go on a trip again. She's a horrible companion. \n\nWe'll definitely find something else.
