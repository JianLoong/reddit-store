It means making sure that you are able to pay for whatever you're eating and drinking.\n\nAfter a few times of this, he will learn to stop doing it -- or he won't. But one way or another, you won't have to put up with it anymore.\n\nOnce you implement this strategy, you will be *amazed* at what a wonderful feeling of freedom, relief, and self-empowerment you will feel, when you are no longer allowing him to control you with his bullying.", "But you\u2019re just describing what a parent should be doing anyway.

The father is well aware that it hurts OP. You're giving him way too much benefit of the doubt. His behaviour is on purpose. Like how do you not get it brings him joy to upset OP?

Block him, cut him out, if he wants to fix it he can come crawling to you. Do not allow this person to hurt you any more. Anyone can procreate, it takes real humanity and effort to raise a child and this sorry excuse for a man isn\u2019t it.
