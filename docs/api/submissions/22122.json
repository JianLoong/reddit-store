His friend introduced him to Christianity, and my son immediately took a liking to it. We brought him a child Bible and allowed him to follow his friends parents to church sometimes. He seemed to really like the church, and he said when he was 13 that the church gave him a second home. Me and my husband aren't religious, so we didn't go, but I trusted the church because my sister goes there as well. But recently, he hasn't been as passionate about it. I thought he was discovering himself, so I didn't think much about it.  \n\n\nThe day before yesterday, I woke up to use the restroom, and when I passed through the hallway, I heard my son crying\u2014not ordinary crying, like hyperventilating; he couldn't breathe. I walk in on him, and he starts telling me while crying, \"Who am I without God? I think I have lost myself. I can keep asking for forgiveness for being human. How do I stop lying, feeling jealous, and being envious? I am doomed to hell.\" I had to hold him as he cried himself to sleep. The next morning I was talking to my husband, and his elder sister overheard and told us that he cries like that sometimes when he feels confused with himself and has mental breakdowns, and he wouldn't talk to her if she told me or her dad sooner. According to her, this has been happening for about 3 years.  \n\n\nMe and his dad went back to discussing and decided that we needed to confiscate his bible. It is obvious that this is taking an emotional toll on him. Well, when my son woke up, he found out we had confiscated the bible and his notes and said we wouldn't allow him to go to church anymore. He got upset. From calm, he turned into a whole different person. He was screaming to give his things back, and we couldn't stop him from going crazy. His dad had to hug him to restrain him, and he has isolated himself in his room. He is only talking to his siblings, and their communication seems to be very limited. With such a strong reaction, I'm starting to wonder if I'm doing the right thing. I asked my sister about the community, and she says it's fine. I watched the church because they have videos of their sermons on YouTube, and they don't seem to do anything extremist. Am I being an asshole by confiscating and restricting this part of his life?", "created_utc": 1689255121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ykztv/aita_for_confiscating_my_sons_book/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly it's really not a reddit question.\n\nI'm gonna say YTA because you all seem to be not paying attention to signs of mental illness.", "YTA\n\nConfiscation isn\u2019t the answer to this; therapy is. Understandably you\u2019re coming from a caring stance, however what you\u2019re doing has the potential to cause more harm to your son. There are medical professionals who are far more qualified to handle this scenario, please engage with them.", "YTA. Firstly, how the fuck did it get to this point? Are you really that uninvolved in your son's life? 3 years?! You didn't once think to check out this Church? Absolutely irresponsible of you. Secondly, confiscating his book is clearly adding to his distress. It isn't doing anything to help him with his mental health.", "I\u2019d seek professional psychiatric help with this and not reddit, taking away his things cold Turkey COULD be harmful, something like his entirely belief system changing and being flipped is pretty intense and best route would be to get a psychiatrist to help on what\u2019s the best method to go about it", "Soft YTA. I understand you wanting to protect your son. But he is 17. Surely you could have had a conversation or two before confiscating his things. Most churches have a youth group with pastors/mentors who I am sure will be more than happy to help guide your son. Since he seems very much into this religion, maybe you can try to reach out to the church. Part of the Bible discusses remaining true in your faith even under the threat of persecution (in this case, you banning him from his faith) If you try to force him away, he may double down and this could cause him even more anguish.", "YTA. Confiscating his stuff isn't going to change anything about how he feels, and is more than likely to make him feel like you're making things worse for him. \n\nYou need to speak to a therapist, and probably given how far it's gone, you might want to look into deprogramming. I'd also bet that the church, if it does do extreme stuff, is less likely to put that online.", "Taking away his Bible and ability to go to church is not going to magically deconvert him, just make him resent you for it. And at 17, high chance he'd shut you out once he's 18.\n\nYou need to actually be active in his religious beliefs and, with his church and a therapist, guide him to reconciling his flawed humanity with his beliefs.", "YTA. This isn't going to solve anything. It would be better to have him talk to a therapist and someone in the clergy, because this is not the way the Bible is supposed to make people feel. Something's gotten mixed up in his personal interpretations, and that's going to require some theology to clear up the misunderstandings, followed by psychology to help deal with the trauma those misunderstandings have wrought.\n\nConfiscating the Bible is only going to ossify those misunderstandings. That, in turn, will prevent your son from being able to justify the therapist's suggestions. This is why you need a two-pronged approach.", "YWBTA because that isn't going to fix the issue. He obviously needs therapy.", "YTA. Your son has three years worth of deep ingrained problems and if you think removing a book is going to suddenly fix him then you are sorely mistaken. \n\nHe clearly has a very confused view of religion so he either needs proper theological help to understand the bible better, or proper psychological help to wean him off whatever damaging beliefs he's absorbed.", "I\u2019d say YTA because of the action of confiscating and also because from what I\u2019ve read, you as parents aren\u2019t taking any parenting actions, just letting him leave loose like you just provide him with food and shelter.\nTry to be more active in his life, the kid is obviously passing through a difficult time in his life and he needs to understand that he is taking it too far and if fear of hell is what is causing all of this, just tell him to read Isaiah 53. Understanding that yes, we are born doomed to hell, but through Christ\u2019s sacrifice we can achieve salvation is the core of Christianity.\nHe needs therapy, and you also need to be present in his life and seek what are the advice he is taking in church, because this thoughts don\u2019t seem natural to appear, and I know how extremist and judging can church people be.\nHope you all the best and that he can have a good recover. God bless.", "YTA. You're doing it without explanation or professional help, which is really looks like he's needing. \n\nPeople turn to religion for answers when they are hurt and then find it's completely hollow and that's distressing, help him find better answers.", "YTA. I know you think the book and church are what upset him, and that by removing them he\u2019ll feel better, but it\u2019s not likely to be that simple.\n\nThose are intense feelings and they need a highly skilled therapist to untangle them. Removing the church will only shut him down right now.\n\nJust focus on his pain and sadness and go to therapy. See what steps they recommend from there. He may have latched on to the church because he was already struggling emotionally and you just didn\u2019t see it.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get more involved in his life - in a supportive way. Start by being curious and interested about his feelings and his passion for chief instead of judgmental and he may open up to you.", "Taking away his Bible and not allowing him to go to church anymore at 17 will not stop him from doing so and will not help him either. But it looks as if he met people in the church who have extreme ideas. You should not let him go to church alone to make sure these people don't confuse him any more and the things taught in church don\u2019t harm him. But most Important he needs to see a therapist ASAP.", "YTA\n\nHe needs help.  Taking key parts of his life away isn't going to do anything but make stuff worse.  \n\nYou need to talk to him and get him help.", "If this is all you do and don't give him help to work through this, yes, YTA.\n\nHe's latched on to something that while it seems benign to you, is anything but. This church has made him think he's garbage because he has normal human feelings. Rather than viewing it all as allegory, he  has taken everything he's heard and read very literally and it's put him in a crisis. \n\nSimply forbidding him from going to church and taking his bible isn't going so solve it, it isn't going to fill the hole that this church filled in his life, it isn't going to help him think critically about what he's heard and read, it isn't going to help him regulate his emotions. \n\nGet him some counseling straight away, A cold turkey withdrawal from something that's helped him feel included and loved is going to be really painful for him.  And it will have repercussions in your relationship  with him for a long time if it's not handled with love and caring.  Do this and you'll not be the asshole. Don't do it, and you will be.", "YTA.\n\nYou were far too passive in your son\u2019s religious journey. You can\u2019t rely and trust others to guide your child\u2019s spiritual and mental growth.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be religious but if you are comfortable with your son exploring religion then you have to go to church with him. You have to learn what he\u2019s learning.\n\nYour choices just confirm to your son that you are not someone to turn to when it comes to faith. He thinks you are now against all religion. Your hard stance has done the opposite effect of what you intended. You are more of an outsider to your son than ever.\n\nI also may get downvotes for this next part but there is a reason people turn toward organized religion. Religion provides people guidance. However, it also provides people community. If you and your husband aren\u2019t religious, what community did you provide your children in lieu of a congregation? What sense of belonging and security did you provide? If your child needed something you couldn\u2019t provide, where did you guide them to look for answers? \n\nYou don\u2019t need religion for those things but you do need something.\n\nI would give back your son\u2019s Bible. I would talk to him about his notes and his feelings. I would inform him that he\u2019s allowed to go back to Church but that you will be going as a family so you can talk about the experience together. I would get him an appointment with a therapist and also book family therapy.\n\nYour son is going through something and you are on the outside. If you want to at least get to the point where he can talk to you about it you need to start doing far more active parenting.", "YTA. It sounds like your son might be having a mental breakdown, and while it might be that he is hearing extremist views at the church, it is also possible that he is having an independent mental issue and just fixated on church. Religious OCD is not uncommon and he is at an age where mental problems manifest. You banning the church might not solve the problem, might even make it worse if he believes now his soul is in danger. You should talk to a professional and follow their lead.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't confiscate his \"book\" you confiscated his religion.\n\nSounds like he needs a mental health professional to help him cope with those anxieties he's expressing, and perhaps a spiritual advisor from his faith to help him process how he navigates the nature of being human and how that intersects with his religion.  Those issues he's describing (distinguishing between self and god, learning to restrain his worst instincts, and grappling with the consequences of failing in that restraint) are big existential ones that the young man may need guidance on.\n\nIt certainly possible that some extreme form of religious practice/ideology is contributing that behavior/reaction, but given how you described it that doesn't seem to be the case here. So rug pulling his spiritual support system outright seems like it might do more harm than good.", "Yta: when do you actually do some parenting, ie: explaining thing, being interesting into his reading, possibly making him see a therapist?!", "YTA - You put your son in an indoctrination center who gave him an existential crisis because religion keeps the masses controlled with the fear of hell if they think for themselves. Then instead of explaining that none of it is real or if you want to keep him diluted with the fairy tale and helping him come to an understanding with himself, you just remove the book and still ignore the issue at hand. At some point you should probably be a parent and help your child.", "YTA for not getting that child to a doctor and to a therapist. If your sister (and many others) can attend that church with no problems or acting out, the problem may just be coming from inside your son\u2019s brain. Get him help.", "YTA\n\nYour son is having some kind of crisis of faith or identity. Are you under the impression that if you confiscate his notes and Bible, then he will just say \"oh, OK then\", and stop thinking about God and faith? That's not very sensible, is it?\n\nYou seem to be confusing a deep faith with an extremist faith. Your faith can be the focus of your life without you being any kind of religious extremist.", "NTA but you seriously need to get him into therapy, specifically one that specializes in religious trauma.", ">I trusted the church\n\nWell that was your first mistake.

It sounds like he is experiencing the common questioning of how to live a Christian life when dealing with our own sinful human nature, which inevitably leads to failures in living up to the ideal. This can be very upsetting. \n\nEach denomination has its own teachings on how to reconcile this so people aren't overwhelmed while trying to be the best person they can be. If he is so conflicted, it would be good for you or your sister (who is a member of the church) to have him meet with the pastor to talk about this with him after explaining the difficulties your son is having.
