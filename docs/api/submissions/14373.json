It\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019re young enough where there\u2019s still time to learn, but your partner is not your possession. She is allowed autonomy to make her own choices without your intervention. She is allowed to have friends and devote her attention to people who aren\u2019t you. You cannot just assume that she wants to go to prom with you by default.

To the people saying that the gf made other plans because she \u201cthought OP might not want to go to prom with her\u201d. She had months before this where the friend wasn\u2019t going through a breakup, and if she really had wanted to go to prom with OP this whole time she could have asked him! I also think this whole thing of not assuming that your *romantic partner of almost a year* would want to go to prom with you is absurd, but even within that framework her actions don\u2019t make sense.\n\nThat said I don\u2019t think she is a huge AH in the sense that people aren\u2019t AHs for not having the same romantic interest as the people interested in them. The only minor AH move is taking too long to break up with him, bc she is clearly just not that into him.\n\nOP is an AH for going to Sarah afterward. This is an issue between him and his gf.

But I can\u2019t imagine your girlfriend would be happy if you invited someone else to prom as your date, which is exactly what she\u2019s done here. \n\nI\u2019ve never known of a couple who went to prom with other people. It\u2019s like the ultimate high school date, why would she even want to go with someone who isn\u2019t her boyfriend? When she realized you weren\u2019t going to ask her why didn\u2019t she talk to you about it or ask you herself? She clearly doesn\u2019t want to go with you, but you\u2019re her boyfriend so that\u2019s a bit odd.

It could be that she doesn't have many other friends or is worried your girlfriend won't have time for her if you are around, but either way she wants more of her attention.\n\nYour girlfriend, honestly, seems the least at fault here. She didn't know you wanted to go with her and tried to do a nice thing for her friend. You can't fault her for either of those things.\n\nMy suggestion is to, first, apologize. At least to your girlfriend for going behind her back and expecting her to be psychic of your needs, and probably also her friend too. I know you two don't get along, but she is your girlfriend's friend and you DID go behind your girlfriend's back to ask \"Sarah\" not to go with her. Aside from it being the right thing to do, it will show your girlfriend you really are sorry for your actions. \n\nNext, explain to your girlfriend that you weren't trying to be threatening, but you did want to go to prom with her. Then\\[and here is where you have to compromise\\], suggest going as a group. The three of you \\[and maybe even some other friends\\]. This way you still get to go with her, her friend won't be \"alone\", and you don't look like an AH anymore.\n\nI'm sure this isn't the answer you were hoping for, and I doubt this will be the last time you two bump heads, but in this situation, you were partly in the wrong and should own up to at least that. I wish you all the best in all of this.", "YTA,\nFirst of all, you never asked, she also didn\u2019t ask but made other plans.

Your gfs friend has gone through a break up and your gf being a good friend, asked her to go together.

Hopefully not something you'll continue to have to deal with throughout life, although no promises because some people never grow up. Sounds like your gf needs better communication. Different people need different levels of communication, and one person's needs may feel excessive to the other. Sarah is communicating with her, so she has the upper hand. Unfortunately, she's communication manipulatively which is how this turned against you. Sit down with your gf calmly and talk to her about what you were thinking and what your intentions were start to finish. Tell her what you think Sarah is doing without making it sound like an accusation. Something like \"I think she's threatened by my relationship with you, but I don't want her to feel that way.\" Your gf will likely notice the difference between your genuine communication and her friends manipulation and accusations.", "INFO:  Is this her prom only or are both of you same grade and same school?

She could have asked you first, but you could have also asked her, but you didn't. So there is no fault there. You're not TA for being upset because there was miscommunication. \n\nThe part that makes YTA is confronting the friend and trying to make her break the date. You had no right to do that. You should apologize and see if there is still a way to make it a fun night for all of you, such as asking another friend and going as a group. \n\nYou all are young and getting ready for college. Prom will be just a blip in the grand scheme soon enough. Try not to take it too seriously, but take this lesson about assuming and communicating with you because it's an important one. Especially entering college where you will be making tons of new relationships.", "NTA\n\nMan, this is your GIRLFRIEND. Of course she's supposed to go to prom with you. This is very, very basic stuff.\n\nIt's insane to think that she didn't know you wanted to go with her. Lmao, imagine if you'd told her \"So, I'm asking Emma to prom, that's cool, right?\"\n\nThis is a seriously disrespectful move. Dump this girl! She is for the streets!", "ESH everyone on here is saying something along the lines of \"why didn't you communicate that you wanted to go with your girlfriend?\" Which is honestly kinda dumb. Clearly she wanted to go to the prom because she asked her friend. Why didn't she ask you if you guys wanted to go to prom? That discussion with each other never really happened. Between people who are dating and events like prom which is are generally coordinated for couples, it's kind of an unspoken agreement that you go with each other unless you guys have discussed otherwise. For example, if I knew that my girlfriend didn't like parties or dances like the prom, then I'd ask her if she wanted to go with me, but if there was no indication that she wouldn't want to go, it's not unfair of you to assume that your girlfriend would be going to prom with you. \n\nMy take from this is that you are not the main priority of your relationship right now. Which sucks ass, I feel you. But the reason that this is ESH is because you shouldn't have gone to talk with her friend. The proposal already happened and you tried to go behind her back to \"fix\" the situation. Honestly, I would have communicated (to your girlfriend, not her firend) that I would not be comfortable with her going to the prom with her friend, and that it would be a dealbreaker. Bur if this is something you think you can get over, all you man.", "YTA. You needed to ASK your gf if you wanted to go to the prom with her. It was a serious asshole move not to do so. I honestly would be surprised if you have a gf much longer.", "He should communicate better but prom is traditionally a dating event.

I can totally understand being embarrassed about that, and it almost seems like that\u2019s the point. Because otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t the gf let him know beforehand (either that she wanted to go with her friend or that she wanted him to ask her)?", "And the girlfriend did exactly the same thing to OP.", "Tbh, at this age I do think its healthy to put your friends before romantic partners.", "I do get what the OP was thinking though.
