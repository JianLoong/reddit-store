You cannot just assume that she wants to go to prom with you by default.

To the people saying that the gf made other plans because she \u201cthought OP might not want to go to prom with her\u201d.

I also think this whole thing of not assuming that your *romantic partner of almost a year* would want to go to prom with you is absurd, but even within that framework her actions don\u2019t make sense.\n\nThat said I don\u2019t think she is a huge AH in the sense that people aren\u2019t AHs for not having the same romantic interest as the people interested in them. The only minor AH move is taking too long to break up with him, bc she is clearly just not that into him.\n\nOP is an AH for going to Sarah afterward. This is an issue between him and his gf.

But I can\u2019t imagine your girlfriend would be happy if you invited someone else to prom as your date, which is exactly what she\u2019s done here. \n\nI\u2019ve never known of a couple who went to prom with other people. It\u2019s like the ultimate high school date, why would she even want to go with someone who isn\u2019t her boyfriend?

She clearly doesn\u2019t want to go with you, but you\u2019re her boyfriend so that\u2019s a bit odd.

It could be that she doesn't have many other friends or is worried your girlfriend won't have time for her if you are around, but either way she wants more of her attention.\n\nYour girlfriend, honestly, seems the least at fault here. She didn't know you wanted to go with her and tried to do a nice thing for her friend. You can't fault her for either of those things.\n\nMy suggestion is to, first, apologize. At least to your girlfriend for going behind her back and expecting her to be psychic of your needs, and probably also her friend too. I know you two don't get along, but she is your girlfriend's friend and you DID go behind your girlfriend's back to ask \"Sarah\" not to go with her. Aside from it being the right thing to do, it will show your girlfriend you really are sorry for your actions. \n\nNext, explain to your girlfriend that you weren't trying to be threatening, but you did want to go to prom with her. Then\\[and here is where you have to compromise\\], suggest going as a group. The three of you \\[and maybe even some other friends\\]. This way you still get to go with her, her friend won't be \"alone\", and you don't look like an AH anymore.\n\nI'm sure this isn't the answer you were hoping for, and I doubt this will be the last time you two bump heads, but in this situation, you were partly in the wrong and should own up to at least that.

Hopefully not something you'll continue to have to deal with throughout life, although no promises because some people never grow up. Sounds like your gf needs better communication. Different people need different levels of communication, and one person's needs may feel excessive to the other. Sarah is communicating with her, so she has the upper hand. Unfortunately, she's communication manipulatively which is how this turned against you. Sit down with your gf calmly and talk to her about what you were thinking and what your intentions were start to finish. Tell her what you think Sarah is doing without making it sound like an accusation.

Prom will be just a blip in the grand scheme soon enough. Try not to take it too seriously, but take this lesson about assuming and communicating with you because it's an important one.

This is very, very basic stuff.\n\nIt's insane to think that she didn't know you wanted to go with her.

She is for the streets!", "ESH everyone on here is saying something along the lines of \"why didn't you communicate that you wanted to go with your girlfriend?\" Which is honestly kinda dumb. Clearly she wanted to go to the prom because she asked her friend. Why didn't she ask you if you guys wanted to go to prom? That discussion with each other never really happened. Between people who are dating and events like prom which is are generally coordinated for couples, it's kind of an unspoken agreement that you go with each other unless you guys have discussed otherwise. For example, if I knew that my girlfriend didn't like parties or dances like the prom, then I'd ask her if she wanted to go with me, but if there was no indication that she wouldn't want to go, it's not unfair of you to assume that your girlfriend would be going to prom with you. \n\nMy take from this is that you are not the main priority of your relationship right now. Which sucks ass, I feel you. But the reason that this is ESH is because you shouldn't have gone to talk with her friend. The proposal already happened and you tried to go behind her back to \"fix\" the situation.

He could have decided he didn\u2019t want to stay with her in a relationship because she wouldn\u2019t cancel plans, and that would have been fine. He didn\u2019t though. He went to the friend and tried to \u201cconvince\u201d her. A friend who already wasn\u2019t his biggest fan, that was doomed to fail. \n\n\nBut honestly, two weeks out and zero plans is as good as not going together. Limos are often booked months in advance, could he get a corsage still? Because floral shops take all those reservations early too. Same with finding a suit and all that. Tickets too. Nothing said on who was buying or anything. So she likely bought a ticket for herself and decided to go stag before Sarah\u2019s boyfriend dumper her. I mean, if it is like my school\u2019s, prom was a half hour or more away, it isnt like being dropped off at school. Plans don\u2019t just appear out of thin air and we all learn that sooner or later. While I found a lot of prom stuff silly I realized my friends did not. Didn\u2019t make snide comments and was a good friend and bought my dress so we could all go as a group. Posts like this remind me how happy I am that I am no longer a teenager and have my husband of over fifteen years. The stress sucks.", "There's basic norms we rely on. \"Valentine's Day is for romantic partners\" is one, but there's exceptions.\n\nBut either way, she is now fully aware he wants to go with her. She's still ditching him. Asshole move.", "&#x200B;\n\n>**The issue is not who asked or didn't ask.**   \n>  \n>**This is about OP not even bothering to ask his GF** about the most basic things of a big formal dance, like scheduling or flowers and tie.\n\nAre you high?\n\n\"The issue isn't about who didn't ask, it's about how OP didn't ask!\"\n\n>he is wrong for not bothering to do the most basic planning\n\nAnd again, we're straight back to \"Why didn't she?\"\n\n>But I know that you just came here to yell about how girls are bad and awful \n\nGirls aren't a hivemind. Many are bad and awful, many are fantastic and truly spectacular.", "Lmao, man's really trying to argue that we CAN make assumptions, but only those based off... hundreds of years of tradition?\n\n*Really*?\n\nThat's the argument you think holds? \"Well honey, for hundreds of years, the man has controlled the house, so back to the kitchen for you! You should've communicated you weren't willing to do this, you can't just assume!\"", "This! Platonic friends doing something together isn't cheating and equating what the gf did to cheating is ridiculous", ">if my boyfriend was calling prom \u201csilly\u201d \n\nWhere'd he do that?\n\n>wouldn\u2019t talk to me about plans,\n\nThere's a pretty huge difference between not starting the conversation, and not being willing to talk to you about it.", "Okay, basic norms, if we\u2019re going to be using that argument, then another basic norm is that the boy asks the girl to prom, and the girl waits patiently to be asked. Personally I think that\u2019s just as much horseshit as Valentines Day, but if you\u2019re using the basic norms argument, then it\u2019s hypocritical to expect to be able to pick and choose which basic norms are acceptable and have your partner just telepathically understand that. If there\u2019s exceptions that are important enough to you that you will be upset otherwise, then communicate them.\n\nYou\u2019re shifting the goalposts now\u2026first she was an asshole for not being fussed about not going to prom with him, now she\u2019s an asshole because she\u2019s not changing her plans for him now that she\u2019s fully aware that he wants to go with her. When does this guy take responsibility for things not happening the way he wanted them to, even though he did exactly nothing to ensure it?\n\nShe made other plans. If she breaks those plans with her friend now, then she\u2019s being an asshole to them. OP needs to take the L here and be more proactive and communicative about what he wants in future. I get that he\u2019s hurt that he\u2019s not getting what he wanted, but she is not being an asshole to her boyfriend by keeping a commitment she made to a friend. Friends are important and at 18 years of age, they\u2019re more likely to have more longevity than a boyfriend. So you don\u2019t fuck them over and alienate them for a man who dropped the ball on Prom and now wants everything to work out in his favour anyway.", "I mean, if that\u2019s how they were raised then yes you need to communicate that. I\u2019m a woman at that, who wants a stay at home wife.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversation that you have lol \n\nNot sure why that\u2019s a hard concept", ">Okay, basic norms, if we\u2019re going to be using that argument, then another basic norm is that the boy asks the girl to prom, and the girl waits patiently to be asked\n\nThat's sexist. We can reject basic norms if we have a clear reason to.\n\n>first she was an asshole for not being fussed about not going to prom with him, now she\u2019s an asshole because she\u2019s not changing her plans for him now that she\u2019s fully aware that he wants to go with her.\n\nThat's literally the same point, her lack of desire to go with someone she chose as a romantic partner.", ">I mean, if that\u2019s how they were raised then yes you need to communicate that.\n\nNo, you said I can just assume that they'll stay in the kitchen and let me control the house, no communication needed.\n\nIt's what humans have done for hundreds of years, so that can be assumed.\n\nOr, if we're honest, is this just a bullshit double standard from you?", "He is the one that is upset his expectations were not met, so the onus is on him to communicate those expectations clearly rather than assume that they are understood.\n\nShe\u2019s not upset that he didn\u2019t ask her to prom, she\u2019s not upset that she isn\u2019t going to prom with him. There\u2019s nothing for her to practice communicating better about because she\u2019s not the one who is upset by the communication breakdown. He is. The failure to communicate his expectations are on him.\n\nWhether or not you think her not caring about going to prom with him makes her a poor girlfriend is a separate issue, but regardless it\u2019s still not her responsibility to ensure he gets his unspoken expectations met. That\u2019s not a healthy way to expect your partner to behave. If you want something, you be clear about it. Even if you think it goes without saying, you say it anyway. If you expect people to read your mind, especially if it\u2019s really important to you like this was for OP, then you\u2019re just going to end up disappointed."]}
