You cannot just assume that she wants to go to prom with you by default.

To the people saying that the gf made other plans because she \u201cthought OP might not want to go to prom with her\u201d.

I also think this whole thing of not assuming that your *romantic partner of almost a year* would want to go to prom with you is absurd, but even within that framework her actions don\u2019t make sense.\n\nThat said I don\u2019t think she is a huge AH in the sense that people aren\u2019t AHs for not having the same romantic interest as the people interested in them. The only minor AH move is taking too long to break up with him, bc she is clearly just not that into him.\n\nOP is an AH for going to Sarah afterward. This is an issue between him and his gf.

But I can\u2019t imagine your girlfriend would be happy if you invited someone else to prom as your date, which is exactly what she\u2019s done here. \n\nI\u2019ve never known of a couple who went to prom with other people. It\u2019s like the ultimate high school date, why would she even want to go with someone who isn\u2019t her boyfriend?

She clearly doesn\u2019t want to go with you, but you\u2019re her boyfriend so that\u2019s a bit odd.

It could be that she doesn't have many other friends or is worried your girlfriend won't have time for her if you are around, but either way she wants more of her attention.\n\nYour girlfriend, honestly, seems the least at fault here. She didn't know you wanted to go with her and tried to do a nice thing for her friend. You can't fault her for either of those things.\n\nMy suggestion is to, first, apologize. At least to your girlfriend for going behind her back and expecting her to be psychic of your needs, and probably also her friend too. I know you two don't get along, but she is your girlfriend's friend and you DID go behind your girlfriend's back to ask \"Sarah\" not to go with her. Aside from it being the right thing to do, it will show your girlfriend you really are sorry for your actions. \n\nNext, explain to your girlfriend that you weren't trying to be threatening, but you did want to go to prom with her. Then\\[and here is where you have to compromise\\], suggest going as a group. The three of you \\[and maybe even some other friends\\]. This way you still get to go with her, her friend won't be \"alone\", and you don't look like an AH anymore.\n\nI'm sure this isn't the answer you were hoping for, and I doubt this will be the last time you two bump heads, but in this situation, you were partly in the wrong and should own up to at least that.

Hopefully not something you'll continue to have to deal with throughout life, although no promises because some people never grow up. Sounds like your gf needs better communication. Different people need different levels of communication, and one person's needs may feel excessive to the other. Sarah is communicating with her, so she has the upper hand. Unfortunately, she's communication manipulatively which is how this turned against you. Sit down with your gf calmly and talk to her about what you were thinking and what your intentions were start to finish. Tell her what you think Sarah is doing without making it sound like an accusation.

She is for the streets!", "ESH everyone on here is saying something along the lines of \"why didn't you communicate that you wanted to go with your girlfriend?\" Which is honestly kinda dumb. Clearly she wanted to go to the prom because she asked her friend. Why didn't she ask you if you guys wanted to go to prom? That discussion with each other never really happened. Between people who are dating and events like prom which is are generally coordinated for couples, it's kind of an unspoken agreement that you go with each other unless you guys have discussed otherwise. For example, if I knew that my girlfriend didn't like parties or dances like the prom, then I'd ask her if she wanted to go with me, but if there was no indication that she wouldn't want to go, it's not unfair of you to assume that your girlfriend would be going to prom with you. \n\nMy take from this is that you are not the main priority of your relationship right now. Which sucks ass, I feel you. But the reason that this is ESH is because you shouldn't have gone to talk with her friend. The proposal already happened and you tried to go behind her back to \"fix\" the situation.

She accepted that her BF was not going to ask her and made other plans. And she was upfront about it.  OP's communication was poor for the outcome he wanted, since what he communicated by his silence was that he didn't want to take her to the prom. It may be sexist, but the basic assumption is still that the boy asks the girl.  He didn't ask, so she decided to go ask someone else. Was it kind of a power move on the GF's?  Could have been, sure, but he shouldn't have just assumed that she would fall in line with his low effort plan. It is a big deal to get ready for a prom -- it involves clothes, shoes, hair, makeup, accessories, the whole none yards.  Without *any* word from him, she was just supposed to what, get all dressed up and wait quietly at home for him till he deigned to pick her up on prom night?  Sounds to me like she had invested in all that stuff, but at two weeks prior, still with no word from him or questions like, what color is your dress so I can get you a corsage, what time will I pick you up, do you want to go to our friends' after party, or anything -- and he should have been asking those questions, it is weird he wasn't doing that -- she just gave up and asked her friend instead.\n\nIt is true by the way that these two people are probably not right for each other, but how many people meet their one true love at age 18?
