Jerkface lives in a house with his girlfriend (Kate) and his girlfriend's 3 kids. I live one town over from Jerkface in an efficiency apartment with my boyfriend. I just recently re-connected with my mom and her family after nearly 8 years of estrangement. \n\nA few days ago my mother bought a one-way ticket for Zoey to visit her father. Upon arriving in Minnesota, it was discovered that Jerkface was several hours away, staying with a much younger woman. Apparently, he and his girlfriend had broken up and he dipped to go fuck around with his \"sugar baby\". All without telling my mom or sister. \n\nStill, since the house is under both Jerkface and Kate's names, Zoey has her own room and is allowed to stay there for the time being. \n\nNow here comes the problem (as if having a deadbeat dad wasnt enough of a problem for her): Kate isnt a nice woman, and neither are her kids. Zoey has told me many times that they all talk down to her, make fun of her style/interests, and most recently have snuck into her room and stolen some sentimental belongings. Shes deeply uncomfortable staying there, and sometimes the bullying gets physical (throwing small objects, shoulder checking). \n\nMy mom has asked if Zoey can stay with me for an unspecified amount of time, so that shes able to hang out with her friends that live nearby, and have a somewhat normal summer. \n\nWhile I love my sister and I dont want her to stay in an uncomfortable/unsafe environment, my apartment just isnt a viable option. Like I mentioned, it's an efficiency\u00a0 with 450 sqft of space. Regardless, we are a young couple and there is alcohol/substances/intimate items that are inappropriate for a 15 year old in the apartment. We dont have the resources to support another person, and I'm not comfortable leaving her alone all day while we're both at work. And to top it all off, my sister and my boyfriend have never even met. \n\nDespite me trying to explain all this to my mom, she keeps pushing it. She says she'll send money for groceries and bills, that my partner and I can \"hold off on sex\" while shes there, and hide or get rid of anything inappropriate. I just dont see how this is fair to myself and my partner or to my sister, but maybe I'm being selfish. Am I an asshole for not taking in my own family, despite the present problems?\n\nEDIT: 1) my sister doesnt want to leave because her belongings are there, and she afraid they'll be further ransacked if she isnt present. \n2) efficiency is a one-room, one bathroom apartment. The living room, kitchen, and bedroom are all one space, about the size of the average living room\n3) I'm living in an efficiency for a reason- I dont have enough money to rent a storage space, and I don't own a vehicle to pick her up so it would have to rideshare because of the distance (no bus routes)\n\nEDIT 2: I didnt mean to make my mom out to be an irresponsible or neglectful parent; she genuinely loves Zoey, and had no idea that Jerkface lied about being home until it was all too late. She had no intentions of dumping her on someone else, and wanted her daughter to be able to see friends and get out of her depressive state since being in FL for the last year. Jerkface is the neglectful POS who'd rather pound p*ssy than spend time with his daughter (who idolized him for most of her life btw)", "created_utc": 1687895349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14knh8x/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_cant_house_my/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given that your mom offered to send you money for Zoey's groceries etc. (IMHO because she wants to be rid of Zoe for the summer, if not longer), she can surely afford the postage on a few boxes assuming Zoe isn't shipping an elephant.\n\n2.) Zoe gets on a plane and goes home to Florida.  \n\nNone of this should be Zoe's choice.  Zoe is your mother's responsibility as her father would appear to have abdicated.
