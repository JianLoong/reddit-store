Jerkface lives in a house with his girlfriend (Kate) and his girlfriend's 3 kids. I live one town over from Jerkface in an efficiency apartment with my boyfriend. I just recently re-connected with my mom and her family after nearly 8 years of estrangement. \n\nA few days ago my mother bought a one-way ticket for Zoey to visit her father. Upon arriving in Minnesota, it was discovered that Jerkface was several hours away, staying with a much younger woman. Apparently, he and his girlfriend had broken up and he dipped to go fuck around with his \"sugar baby\". All without telling my mom or sister. \n\nStill, since the house is under both Jerkface and Kate's names, Zoey has her own room and is allowed to stay there for the time being. \n\nNow here comes the problem (as if having a deadbeat dad wasnt enough of a problem for her): Kate isnt a nice woman, and neither are her kids. Zoey has told me many times that they all talk down to her, make fun of her style/interests, and most recently have snuck into her room and stolen some sentimental belongings. Shes deeply uncomfortable staying there, and sometimes the bullying gets physical (throwing small objects, shoulder checking). \n\nMy mom has asked if Zoey can stay with me for an unspecified amount of time, so that shes able to hang out with her friends that live nearby, and have a somewhat normal summer. \n\nWhile I love my sister and I dont want her to stay in an uncomfortable/unsafe environment, my apartment just isnt a viable option. Like I mentioned, it's an efficiency\u00a0 with 450 sqft of space. Regardless, we are a young couple and there is alcohol/substances/intimate items that are inappropriate for a 15 year old in the apartment. We dont have the resources to support another person, and I'm not comfortable leaving her alone all day while we're both at work. And to top it all off, my sister and my boyfriend have never even met. \n\nDespite me trying to explain all this to my mom, she keeps pushing it. She says she'll send money for groceries and bills, that my partner and I can \"hold off on sex\" while shes there, and hide or get rid of anything inappropriate. I just dont see how this is fair to myself and my partner or to my sister, but maybe I'm being selfish.

A 450 sq foot efficiency apartment is barely enough room for the two of you, let alone trying to squeeze a 15 year old in for an entire summer??!!\n\nMaybe your sister's dad and mom have family nearby that wouldn't mind her staying for the summer? If not, back to your mom she goes.", "This says volumes when your parents are somehow making you the bad guy in this situation of their creation. Your sister needs to count her losses and go back to Florida.", "NTA\n\nPoor Zoey, what an awful situation with her dad and stepmother, but that still doesn't mean you have to house her in a 450 studio apt with you and your partner for the summer.\n\nMaybe offer to house her overnight on her way to the airport or train station or bus depot when your mom sends her ticket for her return home to Florida.", "NTA.  Send her back on the bus.\n\nOr a tiny compromise : Maybe Agree to take her in for a week while she sees her friends and then she leaves on the bus.", "NTA\n\nHer parents are failing her.

Why isn't your mother just sending Zoey a ticket to come back home? This seems shady to me - like was the one-way ticket to trap the father into paying expenses for return? Did she not want her daughter to come back? WTH. She needs to get her daughter out of that house and it's not your job it's hers. \n\nI wouldn't trust mom to pay any expenses or I'd say go get Zoey immediately and maybe keep her for a weekend so she can see friends and then send her home. If you did that, I expect your mother to leave her with you.", "NTA - The entire summer is too long. A week or two would be reasonable while she sees some friends or finds somewhere else to stay for the summer, but not longer.

You can't just shove your teenager off on a random adult who you have no relationship with.", "Me personally I\u2019d take my brother in, even in bad circumstances, but still NTA, mom should buy her a ticket so she can get back to where mom is. It\u2019s clearly unsafe where she is, but if I were you I\u2019d take her in till you settle the shit with your mom. Shit can hit the fan quick and leaving your sister in that position till mom decides to man up could be harmful.", "YTA. All those issues can be managed easily (I also have a tiny flat):\n\n- she sleeps on the couch or an air mattress, and as long as it's not an outright studio have her in the main room not the bedroom\n- move the substances and intimate items to your room, and she's also old enough to know adults have sex\n- simply having alcohol in the flat won't make her suddenly become a drunkard, just tell her not to touch it\n- agree some rules on tidyness and chore-sharing \n- ask your mum for some financial help\n\nDon't leave a 15 year old being bullied and frozen out including by an adult just because you don't want to be mildly inconvenienced for a couple of weeks - and yes, it's a mild inconvenience, not a major one.", "ESH.

Youre not in the position to take in a teen for the summer, especially on short notice. It would be best for Zoey to pack up her room and return to Florida.", "NTA. Your mother should have your sister, not you.", "NTA , OP! Is it possible for Zoey to maybe stay with the friends of hers who live nearby? She could even rotate between said friends houses and your mom can send the friends parents money for her upkeep. Do you have the ability to reach out to Zoey\u2019s friends\u2019 parents? \n\nIt sounds like your mom is trying to pawn off your sister on you and that\u2019s not okay. You\u2019re not responsible for her, and you\u2019re not able to house a third person in your apartment for an extended period of time. It\u2019s an A  Hole move on your mom\u2019s part, and also Zoey\u2019s dad\u2019s part for putting her in this situation.\n\nIs it possible for you to keep a hold of some of Zoey\u2019s belongings (the sentimental or other stuff she doesn\u2019t want stolen) until she\u2019s somewhere safer? Also, it might be worth it to look into maybe calling CPS paying Zoey\u2019s dad\u2019s ex gf a visit. She should be able to be charged with child neglect/ab  use and maybe a few other things. A lot depends too on Zoey\u2019s age. \n\nHopefully your sister gets to a safe place soon! NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Zoey has to go home to your mom. \n\nAnd since your mom suddenly made contact after so many years you were always plan B.

If you dont have the space, the resources, AND the will to take a kid in, you should not. You are doing the right thing. The kid should probably just go home.

If the situation is so untenable why isn't Zoey going home, ok she misses her friends but is it worth being shoulder checked on her way to her bedroom, or you taking a 2 month vow of celibacy?\n\nI get Zoeys had a rough time, but considering you've been estranged from your mom for 8 years I doubt your experience was all roses too, you shouldn't have to sacrifice your peace because Zoeys parents keep failing her.", "Mom said so she can hang out with her friends in the area and have somewhat of a \u201cnormal summer \u201c", "NTA but fair or not, you will be if you don't take some concrete action to fix this, as your sister is a minor & cannot rectify this situation herself.  Not to be harsh, but I think it needs to be said that inaction is not an acceptable response when minors are at risk.   \n\nI would call your mom & tell her she needs to take your sister back or you'll be reporting her to CPS as an unfit parent.  I say from experience: you can't reason with deadbeat, crappy parents, only threats work.  \n\nAnd I'd pick up your sister for the time being.  It's not fair to be in this situation but if she's not safe, she's not safe & you can't leave her there.  \n\nI'm concerned though that if your mother doesn't want to take her back, there may be some unsafe activities going on at her regular home too.  It's not a normal parent thing to want to pawn off your kid to \"hang out with friends.\" It reminds me of some drug addicts in my family.  \n\nEither way, I'm sorry you & your sister are in this situation.  I hope y'all can resolve it soon.", "NTA why isn't mom flying her home!?! Your mother is failing her kids hard core on this one.", "Everyone's the AH \n\nAt the centre of this is a kid who no one wants or is willing to inconvenience themselves for. Ultimately she will grow up understanding she isn't a priority to anyone and won't prioritize herself."]}
