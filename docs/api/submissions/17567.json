I asked her to marry me about a month ago and she said yes. \n\nBut now, we are facing the headaches of wedding planning. Jack, my fianc\u00e9e, always had a plan about our wedding, that envolved having the cerimony at a clearing, no reception, and use all the money in a trip abroad, something that was always a dream of ours (which was also going to be our honeymoon) . \n\nTo help with the planning, Jack invited her mom, sister and aunt. Which I was totally fine with, until yesterday. They basically changed the whole thing Jack had in mind. Instead of a clearing, they want a Catholic ceremony (in a church), a big reception and even give out souvenirs to guests. Which is going to be a lot more expansive. But money is not the point. \n\nThrough our whole relationship, Jack always said she hated parties, the whole idea of traditional weddings and damn, were are not even catholics (we are both agnostic). So I have the feeling she was \"convinced\" to change our wedding due to her mom's pression. \n\nWe talked about it, and I said that \"I want this wedding to be all about you, and all the things that you like\". Which she said she has changed her mind, wanted to do a traditional wedding. I asked \"are you 100% sure?\". Which made her snap and say that I was trying to control her and the wedding. I backed out. But then I said \"I just asked because sometimes you can be easily manipulated\". We had a fight and now she is giving me the silent treatment. \n\nWhen I said that, I meant to say that her mom easily manipulate her, which has happened in the past in other situations. I feel like crap. I already said sorry, even brought her flowers, but she can't help but feel blue. \n\nI just want to give her dream wedding. If anyone that went through that could give me some advice, I appreciate. \n\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1684422380, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l1kpm/aita_for_calling_my_wife_easily_manipulated/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were trying to point out that her family is steamrolling her day and she's being manipulated into doing what they want. If ya'll are both agnostic there is absolutely no reason to have a Catholic ceremony unless someone else (her family) is pressuring her to do so. She wouldn't have had that idea on her own accord\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to ask: are you both baptized in the Catholic church? If not then you can't have a Catholic mass unless you convert no?", "From how you tell it? NTA. \n\nYou were trying to protect (what you believe are) her wishes from her mother, as you have seen a pattern of control in the past. \n\nAdmitting that you have a bad relationship with your family can be really hard because we are raised on the idea that \"they love me in their own way\". \n\nYou definitely didn't word your statement in the best possible way. Noone is perfect but, in future, make it clear that you blame her mother for manipulating her and not her for getting manipulated. \n\nMaybe look for a middle ground? The secular wedding in nature and a reception? \n\nI'm gonna put my Judgy Jason hat on for a second and say: do you really wanna marry someone who will give you the silent treatment, instead of communicating with you like an adult?", ">were are not even catholics (we are both agnostic)\n\nI mean, you won't even be able to get married in the church then, at least depending on the diocese. You have to do some *Catholic* things, and IIRC, promise to raise your kids in the Church. If you aren't willing to at least lie and say you will... they won't marry you (again, diocese dependent so YMMV).\n\nIn any case, I don't want to call you the AH here... I think that you could have said it better, but you are in the right by the sounds of it and you should be trying to help your wife-to-be stand up for herself better against her family. But phrasing it that way probably hurt your cause more than it helped. So I'm not saying Y-T-A, exactly, but I am saying you should apologize either way for *how you phrased it* and use that to restart the conversation which clearly needs to be had.", "NTA.\n\nI know that when people come to us with impending wedding issues, the default of this group is to say, \"Don't get married!\"\n\nAnd while I'm not going to tell you not to get married, based on the relationship dynamic I see, your married life will be your MIL calling all the shots, and I do mean all of them.\n\nIf you want something that MIL doesn't approve of, she'll effortlessly play her daughter off against you.\n\nIncidentally, you're also easily manipulated. Your wife managed to make you feel like shit just for questioning her sudden change of mind.\n\nYour wife will not have your back. She has already shown that she'll aggressively and angrily turn on you at her mother's prompting. I won't tell you not to get married, but you had best resign yourself now to the fact that your MIL is going to be ruling with an iron fist.\n\nI suspect she'll also be taking over the parenting if you have kids, and you'll be pretty much excluded from the process.", "Info: How does a agnostic couple get to marry in a Catholic church without lying? My coworkers married a woman of the Catholic faith and he had to convert and do a bunch of classes in order to get married in the church. \n\nI think this is NTA if you have given a true account. She clearly wants to please and have her family's approval and has seemingly given up her wishes so they will be happy with her.", "NTA \n\nI mean you certainly could have approached this more tactfully but if you meant it out of a place of love albeit with a poor choice of words \n\nI wouldn't say she was an ah either and rightfully would get defensive/hurt by your comment\n\nWhat you need to do is apologize tell them you only meant it out of a place of love as it was such a drastic change from what you and them had formerly talked about, maybe even raise feeling uncomfortable about a Catholic wedding if that's the case too for you\n\nLet them process this they may see that someone has steered them this way and come to that conclusion themselves\n\nThe real AH is the family if they have pressured her into this", "NTA, but this could have been phrased better.  Still, that's a pretty big change of heart and plans and certainly frustrating or concerning if her family has a history of bring about such seismic changes.  I get why OP reacted that way in context. \n\nAt a certain point though if she insists this is what she wants you have to take (or leave) it at face value.  Any unwanted compromises are on her at that point.  Her reaction of snapping suggests to me she is having conflicting thoughts but is so used to bowing to her mom's pressure she cant see another way.  What's best for her is finding a way to help her through these to decide what she actually wants, independent of both family and OP.", "NTA and you\u2019d better put this wedding on HOLD until you both are on the same page about the in-laws!", "Hire a wedding planner for Jack. Take the rest of the people out of the equation.\n\nBeing a people pleaser does not mean Jack is easily manipulated. It means she wants everyone be to be happy... perhaps to her own detriment. Don\u2019t argue with her, get her some help & support her in the way she needs support. Making sure her ideas & vision are heard. \n\nKind of YTA \u2014 the statement was unnecessary & unhelpful", "Silent treatment is toxic so I don't condone her behaviour post fight but I think you've managed this situation poorly. As an outsider it's difficult to gauge if she was influenced by her family or if she really has changed her mind but realistically you should probably be more involved in the decision making process. I'd also personally be quite annoyed if my bf didn't initially take my word for it but I'm not sure if there's any history of her chopping and changing. \n\nAlso, and this really has nothing to do with your question, but unless this church is uncharacteristically lax it seems unlikely that two agnostics will be able to marry in a Catholic Church. You might get roped into marriage classes and/or regular services if you want to book it. \n\nAnyhoo, I guess a light ESH. Her for the silent treatment and you for saying the first thing that came into your head without considering the consequences. But in reality, this probably isn't the best sub for this.", "YTA, there were a million other ways to get the point across without sounding like a serial killer lol. I agree it sounds like she is placating her family, but just say that, no need to say she's easily manipulated, it's a very odd thing to say to someone.", "Oh boy. Ok so the silent treatment isn't cool but I think you maybe came in a little too hot. Families often do have a lot of influence and you claim there is a history of this but it's also super possible that she has just changed her mind. Regardless, I think you should be a lot more involved in the wedding planning than you are, especially if you want input which it appears that you do. Slight ESH, I suppose. \n\nI mean, this whole thing is potentially moot anyway as unless you're both baptized, are willing to convert or your in-laws are happy to donate a lot of money to them it's going to be tricky to find a Catholic church that will let you marry there.", "NTA. If neither of you are baptized Catholics then the Catholic Church won\u2019t marry you\u2026they would also make you go through pre-marriage counseling with a priest before they agree to marry you. So I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s gonna work if you\u2019re both agnostic unless you lie. You can always have a ceremony and reception at a venue, it just won\u2019t be a Catholic marriage. I don\u2019t understand the change of heart in wanting to have it in a church.", "YTA. That was a step too far. Could it be she is just going along with what her family wants? Absolutely. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing or necessarily mean she is being manipulated. Could be? Sure, not necessarily. Perfectly ok for us to set aside our individual wants for a collective want and get the same or more satisfaction from that. \n\nYou asked, let her know you'd support her if this isn't what she wanted, she confirmed that should've ended it.", "I read this as \"I want to manipulate you instead of your mom and sister\". YTA", "Info:  who is paying for the wedding?", "YTA.   \n\n\nYou are manipulating her by saying she is easily manipulated. You want her to go back to the original discussion. She is allowed to change her mind. It doesn't mean that she was manipulated. Stop trying to manipulate her into changing her mind again.", "In your point of view and how you've told what happened, you're NTA. In the age old defense that a wedding is all about what a bride wants (which I think is bull. It should be about what the couple wants), you're the AH for questioning her. Her mother may have manipulated her, but in the end it's what the bride says goes. \n\nThis one is hard to judge. I'm going a small ESH. You suck for questioning the bride to be, she sucks for changing every plan you've both had from the beginning. What you've both done is kinda suck, but in the end you'll be happy when you first see your beautiful bride walk down that aisle. \n\nBest of luck to you both!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
