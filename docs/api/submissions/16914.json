Your aunt is the issue and it's messed up to insult your cousin because of your aunts words.  \n\nIt's a bit crazy not to see a plastic surgeon as a real doctor.  There's always stories in the news about even licensed doctors not knowing what they're doing when attempting cosmetic surgery.  That's not something you just go to school for a year and jump into.  \n\nI recommend apologizing to cousin and explaining that you were just hurt and then cutting off contact with aunt.

Honestly, this made me so mad I had to empty my own trash can out. Like another commenter said, they have this outdated idea of plastic surgeons giving rich trophy wives boob jobs when they perform life changing, incredibly complex procedures for people who are genuinely suffering.", "You're both rude by the sound of your post...", "You choose to be a plastic surgeon rather than a real doctor. So why are you so bothered by people pointing that out?", "Family can made you go a bit mad! \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udd96", "Ah, that changes things a little. That's more of a justified asshole move then.

NTA at all!!!!!", "Read OPs comments the cousin did derserve it too bad she wasnt there to hear it first hand.", "So cousin is NOT a nurse, not in Uni let alone grad school. She\u2019s an aid with a first aid certificate. Not even a parametic level of medical training and they think that is more of a real doctor than someone who fixes major injuries.\n\n\nYeah NTA \n\nAnd thank god for plastic surgeons, my son wouldn\u2019t have been able to walk without plastic surgery because his vestigial twin was attached to the bottom of his foot at birth. Definitely a real doctor", "I come from a family of medical professionals and I suppose I\u2019m just surprised that you would allow these people to rattle you so.

You sure weren\u2019t taught a way to act or behave. You made that abundantly clear.", "Didn\u2019t say there was\u2026just made an observation.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being honest now. You\u2019re whole post is filled with contempt for everybody but yourself.

NTA", "Yea reconstructive surgery so cosmetic.\" This person is dying we need a doctor\" just because you have a doctorate doesn't mean your getting up. Like a dentist who walks around bragging they're a doctor but we all know dentists aren't doctors", "Exactly. I keep joking with a friend I'm going to get a BBL from some dude in a van.  She does NOT fond me funny and the first time I said it, she begged me to research heavily and find a board certified surgeon lol", ">I work in reconstruction mostly\n\nYou have my utmost respect.

Your relatives are lunatics.", "I would tell everyone in your family to fuck off and enjoy making bank. Your life will probably be a lot less stressful.", "For sure. There is some justification in snapping, like I said, and not everyone knows how to control their words when they do. But even doctors have things to learn, and this may just one of those things for you, I think. A) How to keep the mean thoughts in your head. And B) Maybe how to go low-no contact with toxic family? \n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly right, OP, but it\u2019s just one of those things you have to shake off. I wouldn\u2019t lose sleep over it. Good luck!", "ETA: Intricate af procedures. On soft tissue, sinews, and muscle fibers, which are ridiculously complicated mechanisms. Meanwhile, you have orthopedic surgeons who literally take a hacksaw to their patients. And they are ALSO real doctors.", "Wtf is going on with these comments? A plastic surgeon is a real doctor.", "What is even up w/ this whole \"real\" doctor BS? \n\nCan *you* adequately reconstruct someone's entire face after they suffered horrendous injuries from a brutal accident? Can *anyone* who doesn't have the kind of education and training that OP has? \n\nEven if all OP did was elective, cosmetic surgeries like breast implants and tummy tucks, do you legitimately believe that you could just pick up a scalpel and do the exact same? No? Then why the fuck are you saying that a plastic surgeon isn't a \"real\" doctor?", "They go to medical school? Plastic surgery is a specialty on top of general medicine so actually \u201cmore\u201d of a doctor, if you will, than a general practitioner? These comments about plastic SURGEONS who literally reconstruct people\u2019s bodies after trauma are so bizarre.", "Have you had any encounter with a plastic surgeon? Like the first comment,  but mine is first person. Mine built new breasts out of my stomach fat so I could feel normal after my double mastectomy.

They're like heat seeking missiles trying to find the tiniest target to blow up.", "I assume you're addressing the original poster, not me?\n\nI think it's common for people to get pulled back into earlier patterns when they return to spend time with family. And the training for an MD sometimes eats up so much of the rest of your life that some of the growing up and learning how to deal with people as a grown up lags a bit. It depends a lot on the person, of course. And the specifics - way back when I was working with a med student who used to be a social worker, and darn, she came in with more interpersonal skills than most people get, ever.\n\n(Not an MD, a PhD - Biology, Neurobiology and Biomechanics - who has worked a lot with both premeds and med students - and has a number of former undergrad researchers I've stayed in touch with who are in their residencies now. I may well have gone for an MD/PhD had I not been dealing with a spine injury, but there you are.)", "I'm sorry if I made it sound like I think I'm better than any other medical profession, that wasn't my intention at all, if you're talking about the fact that I don't think my cousin is a medical professional because she done a nursing plc that's because she isn't, a plc isn't a degree and it doesn't give you any kind of medical licence, she's no more a nurse or doctor than a construction worker who done safety training", "You do know I have experience in nearly every specialty right?I had to go through years of training and am able to do more than reconstructive surgery, it's just my specialty, so you don't view people who help burn victims,scar victims or birth defects as real doctors?what is a real doctor?", "Yeah 100% no one knows everything and people are learning everyday, I've learned from this and I also should add im not one to usually let my thoughts (mean or not) out of my head, and I'm definitely going to go low to no contact with them, thank you:)", "because people forget that plastic surgeons aren't just for elective surgeries like breast implants etc. like plastic surgeons reconstruct after accidents and limb attachment etc", "It's funny how every single commenter saying that would fail an introductory biology course, let alone have the academic chops to get where OP is at. Some peoples' stupidity will never cease to amaze me.", "Technically they are indeed and some of them are in the more proper sense too. I\u2019m just really annoyed by OP\u2019s disdain for nurses and everybody else in her post.", "Bonus point for the ones trying to find a middle ground like \"well, OP is a real doctor cause they're not just doing cosmetic stuff\"\n\nLike, you think its less of a surgery just because its for vanity????\n\nThis whole thread is confusing.", "That makes sense.", "Is PLC the equivalent of a CNA in the US? It's a certificate that qualifies you to wipe butts and be apart of a nurse's army of minions?", "Just like  Stew from the hangover \"we need a doctor\" \"I'm a doctor\" \" stew you're a dentist shut up\" a doctor is someone I would see at a hospital saving lives. Heart doctors, brain doctors you know, the real doctors", "No worries! But FYI, I take back the emotional maturity part. \ud83d\ude05 You seem like you\u2019re doing just fine!", "Even elective surgeries aren't necessarily about vanity either. I have a friend who got a tummy tuck after having 4 kids. During her surgery they also fixed a hernia she got when she was pregnant with twins and did reconstruction on her pelvic floor. She's very happy to have a flat stomach and to not pee herself when she laughs too hard.", "You don\u2019t need to put down breast implants to talk up other things done by plastic surgeons. There are strong reasons women will have Brest implants, from reconstructive surgery, to gender affirming surgery, to mental health after being told they\u2019re not \u201cwoman enough\u201d. And honestly just because they want to. No one should ever be made to feel less than because of choices they make that don\u2019t affect anyone else.", "I think you're projecting onto OP. Her family has ragged on her for years because they don't understand her specialty. Then they tried to elevate another family member who doesn't even have a college degree to her level of expertise. You're coming across as an AH for saying OP isn't a real doctor.", "Plastic surgeons who only do elective surgeries for vanity purposes are real Doctors.  But I figure noting that many of them actually do much more than elective work is necessary because Somehow some people don\u2019t understand that.

Are you a doctor?did you go to medical school?if no then you don't have a say on what a \"real doctor\" is", ">a doctor is someone I would see at a hospital saving lives.\n\nThis is one of the stupidest comments I've seen on reddit.  What about PCPs or pediatricians? They aren't in hospitals saving lives.  They aren't real doctors then? What about all the other specialties that aren't in the ER actively saving lives? Not real doctors i guess according to you.", "OP did the same studying in medical school as every other medical doctor does... I'm not sure if you're a troll or just dumb (or just severely misunderstood how OP's job works, which would indeed make you kinda dumb given how clearly they explained it to you) . OP is a real doctor, she went to medical school... She just chose that as her speciality after med school, the same way that a cardiologist chooses that as their speciality after med school. OP works with burn victims, people who've been mauled by dogs etc. That's life saving stuff. Even if OP only did boob jobs etc, that's still surgery! You still need immense medical knowledge to do surgery like that, just the same as a surgeon doing any other surgery would need.\n\nFor example, I had leg surgery recently. It wasn't life saving, but it helped my quality of life. Was that surgeon 'not a real doctor' because it wasn't life saving surgery and because it wasn't heart/brain surgery?! No... The person that did that is just as much as doctor as OP is!! Plenty of doctors do 'non life saving' things as a majority of their workload, doing solely life saving work isn't what defines a doctor", "I think most of the defense comments are because of the stigma attached to plastic surgery these days. There's still a lot of people who think plastic surgeons exist to inflate the backsides of the Kardashian family. They believe if a person gets cosmetic surgery for a vain reason it's somehow not a real surgery. When in fact anytime you have a surgery it traumatizes the body and there's serious risks involved. So it's highly insulting to say a plastic surgeon isn't a real doctor."]}
