Your aunt is the issue and it's messed up to insult your cousin because of your aunts words.  \n\nIt's a bit crazy not to see a plastic surgeon as a real doctor.  There's always stories in the news about even licensed doctors not knowing what they're doing when attempting cosmetic surgery.  That's not something you just go to school for a year and jump into.  \n\nI recommend apologizing to cousin and explaining that you were just hurt and then cutting off contact with aunt.

Telling your aunt that her child is dumb when your cousin wasn\u2019t there was uncalled for.", "Look, the cousin is one of the people who talk down to OP and partakes on the mistreatment. The aunt speaks as if the cousin is now a doctor, when her studies don't even go further than post-secondary education - not even college. For years, aunt and cousin have been calling OP dumb - why can't she shoot back what is probably a correct assessment?", "thank you.  Cleft lip and Palate birth defect here. I've had many reconstructive surgeries for that.  Still have one more left I need to get to close up a hole in the roof of my mouth.\n\nSoooooo NTA.", "This right here. \ud83d\udc4d", "I am in the US - and I don\u2019t blame you one bit. Plastic surgeons here are among the most highly paid medical practitioners. Insurance doesn\u2019t cover elective procedures, so only rich people get a lot of that - and if they\u2019re rich, they can afford to pay through the nose. Procedures as a result of accidents, etc. are covered, but then you have all of the administrative hassle of insurance. And then there\u2019s Medicare for this of un over 65, like me, which is a great deal for us but a shitty deal for practitioners because it pays only maybe 20 cents on the dollar. I can\u2019t imagine anyone wanting to wade into the mess that is medical care in the United States.\n\nCongratulations on getting through your education and becoming a doctor. You must be proud, which makes your aunt\u2019s behavior that much worse.", "More like Johnny Tremain, I think...", "That tracks, I spent college proofreading some *rough* essays for pre-med friends.", "Yeah I get that. All I\u2019m saying is that belittling the importance of the task does not equate to lack of credentials on the part of the people implementing the task.\n\nWould anyone argue that game developers are not software engineers? No, because even though the product isn\u2019t exactly of core importance to society, the expertise needed is no less than that which is required for other software products.\n\nSame with plastic surgeons. Even if they\u2019re doing boob jobs for rich people, the necessary skills and credentials are no less than that which is needed for other applications of medical expertise.\n\nSo even people under this impression of plastic surgeons don\u2019t have an excuse for saying OP is not a \u201creal doctor.\u201d", "And just to add, there's a lot of stories in this thread about plastic surgery helping folks after cancer, burns and terrible accidents - which is wonderful.\n\nBut it's important to remember that even if plastic surgery is not \"after a misfortune\" and is instead for what people belittle as \"vanity\", it is still serious surgery that that takes skill, experience, planning and training on the part of the surgeon and has serious consequences.\n\nMost famously, Kanye West's mother (but no doubt many others too) died from a botched cosmetic plastic surgery.", "I think you should have led with \"plastic surgery with a concentration in reconstruction\".", "I recently had a reduction and my surgeon was wonderful. I absolutely wouldn\u2019t have trusted someone who wasn\u2019t clearly smart and competent. You\u2019re in a great field that helps a lot of people! Your aunt and cousin are just insecure assholes.", "Op, don't listen to this person. \n\nYou have every right. Your aunt and family who don't call you a real doctor have no fing idea what they are talking about. \n\nYou spent at least a decade training and probably doing little else to get where you are, and sacrificed a lot.\n\n While I don't think people should necessarily flaunt titles, in this case you are absolutely in the right to go off on these people.", "This makes as much sense as saying \u201cYou chose to be an orthopedic surgeon instead of a real doctor.\u201d", "More or less a CNA I\u2019m assuming?", "Perfect comeback.", "Found the cousin.", "Loved that book & Disney movie.", "I get people have different strengths. But for someone so obviously competitive it\u2019s weird not to at least look over a post before hitting \u201csend.\u201d", "I honestly cannot for the life understand how OP's aunt thinks plastic surgeons are not real doctors. YOU NEED TO BE A DOCTOR TO DO RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY, you can't be a English major and do a godamn reconstruction surgery.", "Or just \u201creconstructive surgeon\u201d or maybe even just \u201csurgeon\u201d. OP\u2019s family sounds like a real piece of work, absolutely bonkers.", "L'esprit de l'escalier.\n\nIt is French for \"The spirit (or wit) of the stairs\".\n\nE.g. leaving a cocktail party where you have been insulted, and only as you are on the stairs outside do you think of a response that would have (had it been deployed at the proper moment) reduced your tormentor to atoms.", "At least you now have a list for if/when they try to pull that shit again!", "I am an English major and can confirm.", "I'd encourage you to read up on narcissistic \"baiting\" and \"blame shifting\" and see how familiar it all sounds.   It's impressive you have remained calm as long as you have while being purposefully and persistently demeaned, humiliated, and dismissed for years on end!  The fact that you snapped is a completely *understandable* response when someone continues to be purposefully ignorant and not respond to the controlled efforts you put in to rectify the situation. \nSounds like the rest of your family has made it very easy for you to identify who is worth having an ongoing relationship with. Feel free to let them know that if they ever have a medical emergency in your presence, that you'll be happy to get them a referral to a \"real\" doctor.", "Oh no I didn't mean you. I meant people in the thread in general."]}
