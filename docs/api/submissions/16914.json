Your aunt is the issue and it's messed up to insult your cousin because of your aunts words.  \n\nIt's a bit crazy not to see a plastic surgeon as a real doctor.  There's always stories in the news about even licensed doctors not knowing what they're doing when attempting cosmetic surgery.  That's not something you just go to school for a year and jump into.  \n\nI recommend apologizing to cousin and explaining that you were just hurt and then cutting off contact with aunt.

They think the original corneal ulcer that caused excruciating pain was caused by herpes invading a tiny injury since it healed with valtrex.  But then my eye decided the cornea was borked and it was time for repeated lesions with no apparent cause.  For seven years now.\n\nFortunately after one pretty minor surgery it\u2019s been entirely controllable by spending about $120/year on a specific daily eye goop.  God help me if they quit making it, nothing else worked.", "ohhh, so that\u2019s what my mother meant a few years ago when she said \u201cfixing what having four kids did to me\u201d when i asked wha it was for after she came back from it", "I would also recommend Lindsey Fitzharris's other book, The Butchering Art. Very good, similar to The Facemaker, but about Doctor Joseph Lister.", "Just need a good orthopedic surgeon.  I had bilateral femoral osteotomies done, and the hardware removal from those procedures.  I have scars mind you, 4\" incisions along both hips, but despite being cut twice on both hips, the scars are thin lines and the ones near my knees are minimal as well.  He took care to cut a long the scar line for hardware removal as well (although they were pretty faint and he had to trace them with marker to make sure he could see them).", "Am I the only one who saw the video of the woman crying, begging for financial help when her surgery went wrong and they had to remove her cheeks, just before panning to behind herself where you could see it? That was enough for me.\n\n>!Not sure if I\u2019m allowed to post it here but it\u2019s in nsfl if you type Brazilian butt lift surgery!<", "I mean, i guess but also I don't give a shit if my surgeon is great at syntax morphology or even pragmatics. I care that they're competent within their scope.", "Uh, wow!", "Most hand surgery in Australia is plastics territory, since orthopaedics is essentially carpentry with a medical degree, and hands are too damn important to let an orthopod touch them. Plastics are better at fine, fiddly work. Orthopods are hammers, and all their problems are nails.  \n(Much love to orthopods, but they have a reputation and it's not entirely undeserved)", "Or both?", "Correction: a perfectly valid *doctor* .\n\nWe on here all know plastic surgeons are doctors and even if OP would work only 9-5 as a plastic surgeon, she is *still* a valid surgeon, but OP's family members don't seem to know that and don't even seem to think plastic surgeons are real doctors. Which is really telling what they *actually* know about stuff like that.", "edit: The comment below was removed, good work everyone!", "I think the poor reputation is founded by the fact that there are a bunch of noisy people that had a (bodgy) cosmetic operation from someone who is not actually a plastics surgeon, and I would go as far as  to say not a doctor. Pretty sure they're rarely even med school grads. So cause these patients got a cheap elective surgery from someone they flame the real pros like OP for being fakes because a qualified doctor would have charged more\n\n  that generates the gossip/chatter/convention there's something wrong with the actual qualified doctor who does the surgeries mentioned in the thread, rather than those who bills themselves as a plastics surgeon, but rarely if ever do more than facelifts, nosejobs etc. These cosmetic only people are the equivalent of labourers to tradesmen/engineers in the medical world. \nMy 2 cents", "It's more than just physics. It's an English borrowing; through Latin (plasticus;) of a Greek word. \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 or *plastikos* meaning to shape or mold something malleable. It's attested in English from the 1600s and was applied originally to creating or shaping something. The concept of creation being applied to the word is archaic now, with it being a valid adjective to describe the shaping of something.", "Knowing vs connecting the dots, lmao!\n\nDid an entire quarter on neuroplasticity & shit in the context of art/dance, and I didn't make the connection until *just now*", "Huh, that\u2019s interesting, here in the US orthopedic surgery is highly respected, and the third highest paid specialty behind neurosurgery and cardiac surgeon.", "Good bot", "A cosmetic surgeon is a plastic surgeon who specializes in elective, cosmetic procedures. There's not a lot of difference between a breast augmentation and a breast reconstruction (the primary difference being the lack of breast ductile tissue in the latter).", "Generally speaking, in the US somebody who's calling themselves a cosmetic surgeon isn't board certified in plastic surgery, and could be a general surgeon or even just a GP. As a result, some are better than others since they don't necessarily have the level of training that a board certified plastic surgeon has.\n\nSome board certified plastic surgeons specialize in just doing cosmetic stuff because the money is better, but they go by the plastic surgeon label because they've got the board certification that someone going by \"cosmetic surgeon\" doesn't.\n\nThey're all real doctors who graduated from med school and went through residency though, the distinction is whether they're board certified or not.", "Agreed! And there's also surgeons that'll do totally not needed multiple surgeries or whatever on people with addictive personality and things too", "Historian here, can't do reconstruction. I can tell you that how fucked you are compared to other cases though."]}
