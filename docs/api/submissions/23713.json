Neither of you are wrong about your preferences, but you will need to find common ground. Is a tank top enough coverage; that isn\u2019t much warmer than shirtless? Would an air conditioner keep you comfortable enough to wear a shirt?  If you can\u2019t find a compromise that works for both you, maybe one of you should move out. This is unlikely to just go away so will probably be a recurring argument.\n\nGirlfriend is a big AH for being mean but not for her preference.\n\nOp is a slight AH for not even looking for a compromise.
