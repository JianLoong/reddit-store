Yikes", "NTA\n\nWhat the fuck does your whiteness have to do with it?", "NTA. Shorts should be enough for a guy to wear in a hot, humid climate around his own home. If your body turns her off, you've got a bigger problem. \n\nLet her move out if she wants. This girl isn't the one for you.", "NTA. It's time to move and put that relationship in the rearview mirror.", "Yeah, this is just a small stone in the massive avalanche coming.\n\nPeople that don\u2019t have the backbone to end something just get extremely abusive and act like it\u2019s your fault you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on when they\u2019re the ones that keep with a charade until they have the opportunity to jab and stab. Fake care, fake everything", "If that's what she thinks about you, then you need to find a new girlfriend.", "This! It's unkind and not how you speak to someone you love and are attracted to! You deserve someone who is attracted to you. The cultural difference IS real, but... the problem is not that she doesn't want skimpy clothes at home, the problem is that she expressed it in a cruel and shaming way.", "equally split, bills/rent/food etc", "She doesn't put any extra effort into looking good and never wears makeup, and i don't expect her to do any of that. She has a good sense of fashion but wears PJs/sleeping t-shirts at home. She can't kick me out, we are both on the lease, sharing all the bills. \n\nShe doesn't put any extra effort into looking good and never wears makeup, and i dont expect her to do any of that. She has a good sense of fashion but wears PJs/sleeping t-shirts at home.", "no, at least not by a mile, she is skinny tho, but not thanks to hard work, just naturally skinny, also her hyperthyroidism has a hand in that (she never exercises and refuses to join me in any strenuous activities)", "Me too!!! Well, used to. We have a 6 year old and kids change your habits lol. She definitely doesn\u2019t love OP, I\u2019m not even sure she likes him. Sorry dude, time to find someone who loves you", "I don't get it, you can't deal with a break up but you can deal with a bitter spiteful gf in a barely functioning relationship? The latter seems way worse and draining tbh.", "Odd choice, but your choice nonetheless.\n\nIf you just wanna stay together till you get settled in your new job, might be best to just do what she says. Seems like she's desperate for an excuse to get rid of you.", "Once you are settled, you need to move on. You\u2019re in a very unhealthy relationship. Best wishes on your new job. \n\nNTA of course!", "Yep, you're not wrong.", ".... Seriously why are you two still together?", "You may think you don't sweat but you definitely are. That's why I say, suck it up and put on a damn shirt. There are plenty of light moisture wicking ones that feel nice in the heat. \n\nRegardless, still NTA. She can request but has no right to try and control you, and she has even less of a right to demean you.", "I said it was for me, and my SO has very little body hair.", "Ah, so regardless of effort, she resents your unfit body. If you have gained weight recently, that might be a reason for the resentment. Or if her disdain seems to have come on suddenly, she might just be off you for unrelated reasons, and the weight is just annoying her now. \n\nOr, have you been insensitive about her appearance or anything else about her recently? May also be a reason for revenge or resentment\n\nOr maybe she's just a dick", "I really don\u2019t see this as a right/wrong situation more a compromise issue. Some things are tough to compromise on especially regarding sensory issues. If AC is not an option, that does make it a bit more difficult to find common ground.\n\n I cannot tolerate strong food smells, especially when they linger. I only cook seafood outside on the grill, I would not be a good partner for someone who really loves curries or strong smelling food. I do like these foods and enjoy them at restaurants but not at home. \n\nSome people insist on no shoes indoors, others don\u2019t mind; same with dogs on the furniture. Temperature arguments are pretty common among couples and roommates. \n\nIf you want to move forward, you are going to need to re-frame how you feel about her preference, stop saying it\u2019s ridiculous just because it\u2019s different from how you were raised. Different doesn\u2019t necessarily mean wrong.", "Oh yea, that'll do it. Lol. Absolutely not, I could never imagine telling my husband that his body disgusts me. As a few people have pointed out, she's blatantly trying to do the whole \"if I'm mean enough, he'll dump me and save me the trouble of being the \"bad guy\" not sure if the people that do this realise that they're not a bad guy for wanting out but the minute they do this they're assholes.", "Really need the H on you poo!", "plushtoy kids\n\non a serious note tho, I think/hope it might be just a short period of mood swings due to her starting a hormonal treatment - the last 4 years were pretty good :) if this continues though, then I guess I will have to let go.", "Hahahaha love it", "Tbh I think you might find out that you are better off without her. Having a stressful environment at home and constantly walking on eggshells will definitely affect your performance at work"]}
