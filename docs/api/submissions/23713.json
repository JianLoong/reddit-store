I feel bad for OP. He needs to find someone who loves \ud83d\udc40 ing at his fat white body! Dump the gf. NTA.", "why is that adorable", "NTA My partners entire family are aware that summer means I\u2019m not likely to be wearing pants (trousers for those who get confused) undies and tshirt is standard fair in my house. Even his mates laugh about the amount of times they come through the back gate to see me at the clothes line in my nickers \ud83e\udd23 I prefer it when my partner walks around in just his jocks too \ud83d\ude08 I\u2019m also hefty and jiggly my home my choice!", "I'm the same way, I like being comfortable. I had an abusive ex who started getting mad that I slept naked, his reasoning was that someone could break in a SA, he was such a whack job.", "I wanna say same here, except my husband just perves discreetly and curses that the kids are awake \ud83d\ude02", "This is weird!", "But boob sweat!

OP said that's definitely what she meant and there was no racism involved. It's common to say white to describe a pale person/part of the body. I have been described as white by several white people and they always just meant pale or pasty, and I've definitely used it myself before as well (though obviously not in a mean way).", "The good thing is that now my husband and I are all settled in and my new job is going great! The move, overall, was a very good thing (new job >>> old job, and we are living super close to my family now).
