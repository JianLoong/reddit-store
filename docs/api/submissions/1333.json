Mainly because you and your husband/family have terrible communication skills. None of yall should be making big life changes without talking with everyone first.

Yall need to actually TALK to each other.   \n\n\nNow from the sounds of it yeah Phoebe should take the pup but seriously yall need to figure out how to make life decisions together.", "ESH\n\nYour husband is TA for (I assume) buying the dog without taking everyone's feelings into account.\n\nLily is TA for abandoning Charlie. And for acting so entitled.\n\nYou and Phoebe are TA for making the decision without involving Lily and your husband. I'm assuming he's the one who paid for the dog and Lily's the one who initiated it. So they are involved. Even if they stop pulling their weight doesn't mean you pretend they don't exist when making decisions about situation in which they have been involved at some point.\n\nY'all should have had a family discussion about this. And y'all should have discussed who gets to have the most \"say\" - and clearly that would have ended up being Phoebe. But it is an asshole move for Phoebe to take ownership without discussing it with everyone else. And for you to make that decision on your own without discussing it with the others.\n\n(Also Maddie, Charlie, and Duncan are clearly NTA.

The dog isn't Lily's.  The dog is Pheobe's.  She's the one who has been taking care of the dog all this time.  \n\nThe best thing for the dog is to stay with the person who loves him and has been taking care of him.

If your daughter will have access to something similar there's little worry that Charlie won't have enough enrichment in his life.", "NTA. Jesus, why are you staying with this guy when he clearly favors your youngest? Charlie isn\u2019t Lily\u2019s dog, he\u2019s a family dog, and when his main caregiver moves it\u2019s only fair that he goes too.", "Not the asshole. If your older daughter is the one paying attention to the dog, bye by buying treats another stuff for it, then yes she has every right to take the dog with her when she moves out", "NTA. Tell your husband and Lily that they have neglected the dog for two years. It\u2019s no longer her dog. If they want to keep it they owe Phoebe for everything she has done for Charlie. Bet that changes her mind. Dog walkers aren\u2019t cheap.", "Nta.

He is no longer her dog so she gets zero say in it.", "NTA that isn't her dog anymore. Lilly is acting like a toddler who only remembered they have a toy once another kid starts playing with it. She will not take care of that dog and forget about it again after 3 months. \n\nShe can be upset, but a pet is more than a toy you can pick up and throw away at any time. Phoebe is the real pet owner here, the dog is attached to her and she has shown that she can take care of it.", "NTA", "INFO:\n\nWhy have you stayed in the marriage for all these years when your husband clearly shows favoritism to one of your children? \n\nThe issue that created 'Her Royal Highness of Entitlement'  is the fact that daddy has told her that she's very special and deserves everything and he's proceeded to give it to her without consequence. This should have been a hill to die on, a hole to fall into, and a crater to land in throughout the course of your marriage. Marital and/or individual counseling should have been on the table long ago. Your kids have thoroughly soaked up the messages given to them about the order of importance that was allowed to flourish in your home. This needs to stop. But Phoebe is N T A and should retain custody.", "NTA for letting Phoebe have the dog, but you REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY have to get your husband to take his head out of his ass and stop spoiling Lily. He's setting her up for failure.", "Ask your daughter why she\u2019s been neglecting him for years if he\u2019s her dog. It isn\u2019t a toy she can pick back up when she\u2019s bored - it\u2019s a living being that deserves care and love.\n\nMake a list of all the things Phoebe does for the dog. Ask Lily when was the last time she did any of them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA He's not her pet if she doesn't take care of him.", "NTA - don't budge on this! Let Phoebe have the dog. Your husband will buy Lily a new one anyway", "NTA and this might just be the teachable moment Lily needs to shake off her entitlement and to understand that the world won't grant her every wish and whim, just because dad does.\nShe sounds like she is well on the way to some pretty undesirable attitudes. Time to learn the real life consequence of neglecting a responsibility, while there is still hope for attitude change.", "ESH - Lily for not taking care of her dog and you for trying to give the dog away. Perhaps a better approach would be to talk to lily and start laying conditions for her to keep the dog including walking the dog twice daily for 15 min, weekly baths, some weekly grooming (brushing hair), washing water and food dish weekly and whatever other reasonable stuff you can think of. If she cannot maintain a reasonable level of care, then the dog goes. Document everything and then if you give the dog away, it is her fault not yours. If your husband is available, tell him to walk the dog etc and after enough times, he may end up on your side or at least be more cognizant of the extent of the problem.", "NTA but you really can\u2019t put all the blame on your husband. You\u2019re a parent too and if you guys don\u2019t fix the youngest entitlement, the other two are going to shut her out. Too many posts on here where the golden child is the outsider with their siblings and then world war 3 starts when it comes to weddings, vacations, etc when the golden child isn\u2019t included because no one likes them.", "NTA.\nBut your husband might be for getting someone an animal, who doesn't realise what a big responsibility they are.", "Let me put it this way: if you let Lily keep Charlie, then you're TA. You're doing what's best for the dog that is at your mercy for the daughter who is actually taking responsibility for it.", "> Then Charlie couldn't sleep in Lily's room because Duncan was sleeping there. Lily stopped walking Charlie because Duncan doesn't like to be alone and she stopped playing with him.\n\nI'm curious what happens if you just get rid of this manipulative asshole cat.", "NTA... the one that cares for the dog best is the one that is Charlie's owner. Dogs are not toys. They dont get discarded when you get a new toy.", "NTA", "NTA. I'd tell Lily and hubby that she completely failed as a dog-owner. And if she's insistent on getting a dog, she can get one when she moves out.  Because neither you or Maddie will be taking care of dogs in the future.", "If she does not take care of her dog, she doesn't deserve the dog. Dogs are living creatures, not toys. I'd let your oldest take the dog. You have a serious problem with your husband, and your entitled youngest being his golden child.", "ESH except for the dog, cat, and the ignored middle child who probably can't wait to be free of all this drama. You and your husband need to get on the same page. Seems like there is a lot of animosity in this family because you have been playing favorites between your oldest and youngest. Hopefully Lily can do some quick growing up and realize the kindest thing is to let the person that is most bonded with the dog take it.", "NTA  \n\nMake sure your oldest takes that dog, your 16 year old still has to learn about responsibility and frankly the real AH here is her father.", "nta the youngest hasnt shown the dog any love and care since she got the cat based on what you said and the oldest has been this is about whats best for the dog not best for your daughter your youngest has been taking care of the cat and the dog and cat dont get along it would be easier for the dog to go with the oldest anyway", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter may have been given this dog, but it's Phoebe's now.\n\nOwning a dog comes with responsibility. The dog will be horribly neglected if it stays in your home.", "Your husband is perfectly fine with you making an animal decision by yourself, because he did it when he brought the dog and the cat home.\n\nNTA but your husband is. Your youngest slightly, but that sounds like a learned behavior", "NTA: If she wants Charlie she can start doing all the work that's required for him. Pets are not a right they are a privilege and your Husband and daughter have failed to realize that. Charlie is a living breathing being who deserves the best quality of care. I suggest you make a list of all tasks associated with Charlie (Grooming, vet, walks, food, toys) and their price points and hand them to Lily explain that this is what it costs to have Charlie and that you and your husband and your oldest won't be paying for this any longer and that it's up to her to get a job and be responsible for Charlie. That dog is not any toy that can be bought and played with until the shiny new toy comes along.", "Nta there needs to be more communication between you and your husband. He created a spoiled brat so he should deal with the consequences.", "NTA. You have a daughter  and husband problem. Tell your oldest not to walk Charlie for a day and when he needs to go, open the door to Lily s room.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I do think you should have talked to the family about this first, in the end, when you are talking about a living, breathing animal, what matters is what's best for them.  And clearly that is NOT Lily.", "NTA.  Once your oldest daughter became the one that took care of the dog, it was her dog.\n\nIt's an important lesson-- animals are a responsibility and a companion, not a possession.", "NTA. It\u2019s not requesting a dog that makes you a dog owner. It\u2019s doing the everyday work of owning a dog. Lily is Charlie\u2019s owner in name only. And who exactly is going to take care of Charlie if Phoebe doesn\u2019t take him with her?", "NTA, seems like a good teachable moment. She obviously lacks respect and doesn\u2019t understand what it means to be a pet parent. Phoebe is the one who cares for the dog; not Lily.", "NTA for letting Phoebe have Charlie. And it\u2019s not just because Lily clearly needs to learn that animals are an on-going responsibility. It\u2019s because leaving Charlie in a house where he is ignored and not taken care of would be cruel. Charlie is a living creature and deserves the best life possible. He and Phoebe have bonded; Phoebe takes good care of him; he\u2019s happy and healthy with her. If he\u2019s left with Lily... what would happen with him? Honestly, how good would his care be? Left alone in the house, not taken for walks, not giving any love or training or attention? \n\nLily has to understand that this isn\u2019t about her; it\u2019s about the dog. She needs a wake-up call and hopefully this becomes one for her. If not... honestly, I worry about the kind of adult she will grow into.", "NTA also I would tell Lily if she wants to keep Charlie then she owes her sister back pay for everything she did for him.", "NTA", "YTA, but for apparently making these decisions unilaterally without talking to your husband first.\n\nNot TA for thinking it's a good idea for Phoebe to take the dog. In what sense does Lily actually think Charlie is hers? She doesn't feed Charlie, or walk Charlie, or care for Charlie, or play with Charlie, or seemingly interact with Charlie in any way.", "NTA\n\nPhoebe has been taking care of this dog for two years! She has done all the hard work. Your husband is creating a spoiled, pampered princess, good luck ever getting her out.\n\nLet the responsible dog owner take the dog. Lily can pound sand.", "NTA\n\nLily is too old to treat animals like toys. She had no problem letting Phoebe take care of \"her\" dog but maybe you need to play along and be hands off so Lily can learn what is really involved in Charlie's care and feeding when Phoebe moves out.", "technically she is right but nta, your daughter was neglecting the very thing she had said she wanted. she threw him away like yesterdays trash.", "NTA\n\nLily deserves to have her dog taken away. She's very cruel. Maybe hurting from this will help her not be so cruel in the future.", "NTA lily is neglecting the dog and Charlie deserves better!! #justiceforcharlie", "MTE, seems like there is some clear favoritism going on between the parents. Notice how the middle child is just ignored in all this?", "This is a great idea! Also ask husband when he did any of those things!\n\nNTA.", "That little dog has bonded with the oldest daughter. It\u2019s cruelty to the dog to make it stay with a kid who doesn\u2019t love it.  Dogs know!", "Imagine hating cats so much that you blame this whole mess on it being a manipulative mastermind. Absolutely wild.", "I wouldn\u2019t say the eldest child is an arsehole either, given she stepped in and took care of the dog when the youngest got bored with it.", "Agreed! And poor Maddie, who is going to have the worst middle-child-syndrome ever.", "Exactly. Also, Phoebe\u2019s time has a monetary value too. \n\nI do hope OP figures out how to fix her husband problem before Lily has difficulty understanding why the rest of the world doesn\u2019t treat her like her Daddy does. Is he also going to buy her jobs and housing until your retirement fund is empty? What happens when he has to tell her no? What happens to OP if he never does?", "Well, her husband made the unilateral decision to get the dog. Sometimes you need a taste of your own medicine.", "The cat needs to be taken away too. She's demonstrated that she's incapable of actually loving animals- she'll only take care of them until she's bored, then they're discarded like trash.", "What's MTE? But good observation.", "I don't think she is ignored. She probably decided it's best to stay away from that drama since she didn't care if they got a dog or not.", "Right? Because cat's can be major AH's, but I'm pretty sure this one has no idea what's going on \ud83e\udd23", "Yah, I was on the fence with that. But then I kind of wondered if the oldest purposefully started trying to woo the dog from the youngest? Either way, the oldest sounds like she is being pretty adamant about taking the dog, and ultimately, it's not her dog. She needs to work with her family to find compromise. OP isn't doing the oldest any favors by teaching her she can just take the dog simply because she became bonded with it ... that's generally not how life works, and it's instilling entitled behavior. This family needs a mediator.", "Totally!", "\"My thoughts exactly.\" Feeling a bit too lazy today to spell things out."]}
