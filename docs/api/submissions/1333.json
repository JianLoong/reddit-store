I'm assuming he's the one who paid for the dog and Lily's the one who initiated it. So they are involved. Even if they stop pulling their weight doesn't mean you pretend they don't exist when making decisions about situation in which they have been involved at some point.\n\nY'all should have had a family discussion about this. And y'all should have discussed who gets to have the most \"say\" - and clearly that would have ended up being Phoebe.

But then I kind of wondered if the oldest purposefully started trying to woo the dog from the youngest? Either way, the oldest sounds like she is being pretty adamant about taking the dog, and ultimately, it's not her dog. She needs to work with her family to find compromise. OP isn't doing the oldest any favors by teaching her she can just take the dog simply because she became bonded with it ... that's generally not how life works, and it's instilling entitled behavior. This family needs a mediator.", "Totally!", "\"My thoughts exactly.\" Feeling a bit too lazy today to spell things out.", "NTA. Lily needs to learn the minute she stopped providing any care for Charlie, he was no longer hers. She can have a hissy fit but at this point she just seems like she wants to be the centre of attention. \n\nHaving said that, you\u2019re doing all your kids a disservice in not confronting your husband about his behaviour.

I\u2019m actually sort of with Lily here in that cats are *way* easier than dogs, and she should be absolutely grateful that Phoebe has bonded with Charlie and will give him a wonderful life. Lily can enjoy her (much easier) cat, and Phoebe can enjoy Charlie.\n\nSeriously, Lily should know that little dogs easily live 15-16 years so she will be like 30 (!!!) by the time she no longer has to take care of a dog. What does she think of that?! Maybe that will help change her mind.", "NTA. You should consider if this is someone you want as a husband though.", "NTA.

Ask them who is going to care for Charlie if Phoebe isn\u2019t there? Let Phoebe take the dog and Lily will probably forget about it after her dad buys her something else unreasonable. Probably another dog. \n\nAlso poor Phoebe and Maddie, having a dad that blatantly favors their sister over everything.", "NTA\n\nBack in 2015 I was living with my dad, along with my younger sister. We were both adults. To note I had just been put on medical leave from my job because I suffer from several chronic illness. I was (and still am) very sick. \n\nMy sister wanted a small dog because I had one. Well she already had a dog, a German shepherd that she didn't take care of, I did. I told my dad it was a bad idea but he didn't listen and let her get a dog. A week later she brings home the cutest little puppy. But also that week she starts dating a new guy. \n\nSo after about a week she starts spending more and more time with this new guy. And spending nights away and that leaves me with the puppy. That also leaves me to potty train this puppy. Thankfully I know what I am going but being very sick and having to take care of 3 dogs wasn't easy. But I also wasn't going to let a puppy suffer and live in a kennel all the time. Well the one or two times a week my sister would stay home the puppy wanted nothing to do with her. She would try to take him to her bedroom but the chance he got to bolt he would run to my room and hide behind me when my sister would come looking for him. My sister just couldn't understand why he didn't want to be with her. After a while she finally gave up on forcing him. \n\nSeven years later and I live in my own house with my house with MY dog. I told my sister when she moved out a couple of years later that it would be cruel to take him away from the person he bonded with. \n\nAnd that's what I'd tell your youngest daughter. Charlie has bonded with your other daughter and when she moves away it will be cruel to Charlie if he doesn't go with the one he has truly bonded with. \n\nI remember the look on my dogs face when my sister would force him to be with her when he wanted to be on my lap, or in my room. It was heartbreaking.", "So it's time for a pop quiz for Lily. Don't worry, it's a quick and easy one.\n\nWhen was the last time you walked the dog?\n\nFed it?\n\nBathed it?\n\nPlayed with it?\n\nSpent any time with it at all?\n\nTook any responsibility for it other than calling it \"yours\"?\n\nNow when was the last time Phoebe did all those things?\n\nOnce she passes this quiz then she's given herself her own answer.

We can acknowledge that Lily abandoned ownership of Charlie when she got Duncan the cat, and let Phoebe take the dog she has been responsible for for two years with her. \n\nOr, if you want to argue that Phoebe has merely been pet sitting, you will need to pay her what she is owed. On average, pet sitters make $30 a day. At that rate, over two years, you owe Phoebe $21,900. Plus all expenses she paid for vet fees, grooming fees, toys, food, and supplies.

I deliberately refused all contact with it for a month, to allow lots of time for ex to imprint on it. A week after I started allowing contact, the kitten loved me more. Ex then decided I needed a dog, so the cats would go back to her. If course, the dog also didn't like her, so she decided to get a new dog - just came home one day with an annoying chihuahua/rat terrier mix. She didn't bother taking care of that one at all, and when we split a few months later, both dogs and the first cat came with me, and frankly I'd be surprised if the kitten is still alive.", "Lily is still old enough to know better.

However she noticed that her sister wasn\u2019t really that keen on the dog and pretty much dropped the poor thing when she got a cat so stepped up.

Also, OP says oldest child buys the dogs treats and toys; clearly the parents were still paying for dog food, vet appointments, and grooming appointments. A lot of commentators are being a bit quick to jump to the conclusion that the oldest was keeping the dog from being neglected, when if you really read the post, oldest was  attached to and lavishing the dog with attention, but not financially taking care of it. It might not be so easy for oldest to manage the dog once she's on her own and having to deal with life as a grown up for the first time.

At this point, if the dad and youngest want the dog, they should pay the oldest back for all the money she\u2019s already spent on it. That said, it seems like the dog would be happiest with the oldest, and I think that the animal\u2019s well-being is a fair thing to take into account in this type of situation.", "Well, that's not helping, sir.", "I didn't miss that. I mentioned it in my above post. By \"handling\" I assume that means taking the dog to the appointments and preparing the food, but not paying for it.
