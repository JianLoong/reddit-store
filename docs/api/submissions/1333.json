I'm assuming he's the one who paid for the dog and Lily's the one who initiated it. So they are involved. Even if they stop pulling their weight doesn't mean you pretend they don't exist when making decisions about situation in which they have been involved at some point.\n\nY'all should have had a family discussion about this. And y'all should have discussed who gets to have the most \"say\" - and clearly that would have ended up being Phoebe.

We were both adults. To note I had just been put on medical leave from my job because I suffer from several chronic illness. I was (and still am) very sick. \n\nMy sister wanted a small dog because I had one. Well she already had a dog, a German shepherd that she didn't take care of, I did. I told my dad it was a bad idea but he didn't listen and let her get a dog. A week later she brings home the cutest little puppy. But also that week she starts dating a new guy. \n\nSo after about a week she starts spending more and more time with this new guy. And spending nights away and that leaves me with the puppy. That also leaves me to potty train this puppy. Thankfully I know what I am going but being very sick and having to take care of 3 dogs wasn't easy. But I also wasn't going to let a puppy suffer and live in a kennel all the time. Well the one or two times a week my sister would stay home the puppy wanted nothing to do with her. She would try to take him to her bedroom but the chance he got to bolt he would run to my room and hide behind me when my sister would come looking for him. My sister just couldn't understand why he didn't want to be with her. After a while she finally gave up on forcing him. \n\nSeven years later and I live in my own house with my house with MY dog. I told my sister when she moved out a couple of years later that it would be cruel to take him away from the person he bonded with. \n\nAnd that's what I'd tell your youngest daughter. Charlie has bonded with your other daughter and when she moves away it will be cruel to Charlie if he doesn't go with the one he has truly bonded with. \n\nI remember the look on my dogs face when my sister would force him to be with her when he wanted to be on my lap, or in my room. It was heartbreaking.", "So it's time for a pop quiz for Lily.

We can acknowledge that Lily abandoned ownership of Charlie when she got Duncan the cat, and let Phoebe take the dog she has been responsible for for two years with her. \n\nOr, if you want to argue that Phoebe has merely been pet sitting, you will need to pay her what she is owed. On average, pet sitters make $30 a day. At that rate, over two years, you owe Phoebe $21,900. Plus all expenses she paid for vet fees, grooming fees, toys, food, and supplies.
