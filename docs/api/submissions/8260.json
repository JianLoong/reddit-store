Personally I only wear them in whatever side isn't against the pillow so my ears drain normally at night - I've even learned to take one out and put it in the other ear as I roll over half asleep , it just takes time and practice.", "Let\u2019s assume OP wasn\u2019t working, but just living in the apartment doing normal things, like watching TV.  Or, say, getting something to drink or washing her hands.  Would stepsister expect OP to literally cease living?", "Make her homeless. Give her a good hard smack of reality right in the face.", "NTA you\u2019ve tried to accommodate, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re being unnecessarily noisy doing personal stuff. It\u2019s for work.", "NTA, regardless of what time you are doing your JOB.  Do NOT be as accommodating as possible, live and work your life as YOU need.  Tell stepsis to put in ear plugs, where headphones, use a quiet noise device or whatever.  Has stepsis done HER best to be understanding about YOUR schedule.  YOU already lived there.  Conduct your business as you need to.", "Buy her a white noise machine and stop apologizing. \n\n\u201cSorry sleeping beauty, I can\u2019t quit my job for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to quit my job?\u201d", "Forget the fan! She needs an air purifier. The white noise will drown out any noise and clean the air.\n\nNTA!", "Nah this sucks for both of you and theres not anything either of you can do about it. She could go without calling your schedule weird and hers normal but ultimately it\u2019s reasonable for her to want to sleep but it\u2019s not your fault that you have a job", "NTA because you've tried to accommodate her.\n\nSuggestion: temporary sound proofing panels, I'll bet you can tax deduct them or get your work to pay for them. Also rugs and carpets if you have tiled or wood floors.\n\nI used to live with a person who did sound effects for movies. We were in a different time zone from the US and UK, which was where she got the most work, so often she'd be having meetings or doing sound stuff in the early morning hours.\n\nI don't know if you've ever heard someone try to mimic the effect of being hit with a hammer over and over but its not fun to listen to in the early hours.\n\nI had a 9-5 job.\n\nI tried noise machines etc but our rooms were so close I couldn't really drown her out.\n\nEventually she found some temporary sound proofing panels that helped a bunch.\n\nBetween those and white nose I was able to sleep most nights.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not choosing late hours to be difficult or making unreasonable noise. It's for your job (and her sleep schedule is for hers) so you're both on entirely equal footing there. You've done what you can to accommodate, which is gracious of you, so there's no way you're T.A. for just... doing your literal job, as quietly and kindly as possible.\n\nAt a certain point, she's responsible for her own sleeping issues. And they *are* sleeping 'issues', because it's not actually normal for it to be impossible to sleep just because someone is talking quietly in another room.\n\nIf this wasn't an issue before, did she previously go to bed quite late, after you were done work? If she's typically a nightowl and her 5am wake-up is still very new or she's had to massively shift her sleep schedule, her body might just having issues learning to fall asleep at an earlier time and it might not even relate that much to noise. Does she fall asleep easier or earlier on your nights off? (I assume you don't work 7 days a week.)\n\nRegardless, since you've done all you can with the talking quietly, using a headset, towels under the door, etc, it's up to her to find something she can do that helps her sleep. Whether that's buying some soundproofing foam for her bedroom walls, using a fan or white noise generator (waves, whale sounds, whatever) to make a more monotonous tone that drowns out your voice, or investing in individually-fitted ear plugs that are comfortable (these exist, my SIL used to work for a company that takes a mold of your ear to make them), she's an adult and it's time she start taking responsibility for her own needs.\n\nFinal thought -- one of my own personal vices is complaining. I love to bitch and moan, but part of developing emotional maturity means understanding that one's complaining impacts on others. Your stepsister may still be in that younger-person mindset of \"ahhh life is hard i wanna complain about it and get sympathy\", without necessarily realizing she's making you feel guilty or that by complaining so much, she's implying she thinks it's your responsibility to  fix her sleeping issues.\n\nmeaning next time it comes up, it may be worth it to genuinely and calmly ask her what she reasonably expects you to do, given that you can't change your work schedule any more than she can. she probably won't have an answer, but if she's snarky, reminder her what you've already done to accommodate and that there's nothing more you can do, and ask her what other solutions she's considered or just reminder her that at a certain point, it's her responsibility to ensure her own needs are met.\n\nedit: typos", ">You don't pay rent because then you have a say in the apt.? Sounds like you may have to deal with her being an ass.\n\nSame goes for sister. If she's not paying rent then I guess she will have to deal with hearing conversational voices from the other room. Sounds like a problem for her to solve. \n\nHonestly, if OP has been doing all the compromising and sister has continued to bitch, OP should just live her life as normal, and sister will either figure out a way to get to sleep while someone is working in the next room, or decide to move out and pay rent elsewhere.", "Agree. This is how they do it in therapy offices - a white noise machine in each room. You could even put one outside your door. But after that she needs to adjust. I mean I grew up in a quiet house and lived in American college dorms for a few years and adjusted.", "I\u2019m allergic to the material.  Itchy ears is no fun!", "I'm guessing yes.", "It's not op's apartment, she can't evict anyone.", "Maybe step sis could use a white noise machine to block out the sounds from your work?", "NTA.  This is not your problem to solve, it\u2019s hers.  She can get a headband style ear plugs that will link to her phone for an alarm, she can use a fan or white noise machine or app.  There are many different solutions she can look into that don\u2019t impact you.", "NTA, it's not like you're staying up late to do fun things, you're literally working. Just continue to work and let her figure it out, you've already done everything in your power to accommodate her, other than going part-time, and unless she's going to pay you to do that, forget about it.  Her comment about \"normal people hours\" is disrespectful, your work is still valid even if you do it outside of 9-5, and by that comparison, she doesn't work normal people hours, either.", "Buy your sister a bluetooth sleepmask.  They are only about $10-40.  They are comfortable! They keep light and sound at bay.  They can be synced to a phone or tablet (my desktop isn't bluetooth).

My bed is in the living room (snoring (both of us) and coughing (me) mutual decision) and he was watching something with the soundbar blaring.  I still fell asleep.  \n\n\nSomething to think about trying.  \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\n\\*running water as in rivers/waterfalls/bubbling brooks... somehow they never make me need to pee but just remind me of going camping.
