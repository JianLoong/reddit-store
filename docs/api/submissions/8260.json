I have asked to help with the rent and my dad says no because \"when you start paying rent, you have a say on who can stay there\".\n\nThe apartment is 2 bedrooms, so my stepsister (22F) moved in after graduating about 5 months ago. She didn't work for that time, and recently got a job in a theatre production that means she has to wake up at 5am to commute.\n\nI'm an interpreter and work from home full time (over a year and a half), but due to the timezone differences my workday tends to end between 10pm and midnight, depending on the available schedules.\n\nNow that stepsister is working, she says she can't fall asleep if I talk and I'm ruining her schedule, she's the one who works \"normal person hours\" and that I need to be accommodating of someone with a \"normal\" schedule now that she's working by refusing to work full time.\n\nI've done my best to be understanding and moving my schedule as much as I can, but at this point these comments are driving me insane, and starting to get offensive frankly. At the same time, I sympathize with her having to get up so early, so I really am at a loss here.\n\nAITA for not cutting down a couple hours and in not doing so ruining her schedules?\n\nEDIT: It might be helpful to rundown what I've tried already! I have tried getting the earliest possible schedules (still end 10/11pm), speak as low as possible without it impacting the calls, wear a headset, try to help the noise suppression by stuffing my side of the door with towels... I'm at a loss.

Why should you be the only one compromising? She should invest in some earplugs or a white noise machine. \n\nOr another place to live, taking into account that you\u2019re gonna be the one living there on your own, permanently, if I understand it right.", "This is her problem to solve. You were living there 1st. I have a question, tho. Your parents own the apt.? You don't pay rent because then you have a say in the apt.? Sounds like you may have to deal with her being an ass. Your dad will let her stay no matter what. Sorry\n\nNTA", "NTA, you should not have to change your schedule. Yes, you should try to be quieter or work in your room and close the door if possible. Your sister also could wear ear plugs and make accommodations too. Her requests are unreasonable and inconsiderate. Roommates (which is what you are right now) need to work as a team and she does not sound like she is willing to do anything but tell you to change (based on what you said).", "NTA. She is not more important than you. Just as you work around her schedule, she needs to learn how to work around yours or find a different place to rent.", "NTA tell her to get some noise cancelling earphones or a white noise machine.", "NTA  \n\n\nshe knew about your schedule before she moved in (hopefully) and if not, well she can always move elsewhere or get earplugs or something like that", "What does she expect you to do? That\u2019s your work schedule, there\u2019s nothing you can do. NTA, but I also understand her frustration from not being able to sleep. It\u2019s a tough one for sure. Would working in a different room make a difference? Has she considered some comfy earplugs?", "NTA \n\nIf you share a place you're going to have to learn how to live with the noise other people make. Considering it's your job and not you blasting music every night, she's the one being unfair. I'm not going to say anything about the \"normal work hours\" comments, those are indeed very silly.\n\nThat said, I would consider moving somewhere else. You said you were prepared to pay rent anyway, so why not?", "Nta, she has her own room, she can take personal accountability for her sleep. Get a white noise machine is my personal recommendation", "NTA assuming you don't have to talk over a normal volume. Isn't she also in a different room? Can you work from your room and her from hers? I feel like there is enough separation in a 2br that this shouldn't be an issue. But regardless, she can get headphones or earplugs. I understand it sucks to be kept up, but it's not a matter of you're up partying/having friends over on work nights, you're operating at a reasonable \\*assumption\\* volume during your work ours.", "NTA\n\nShe can wear ear plugs or use a noise machine/app.\n\nIf the insulation in the apartment is so poor you can hear people talking in a separate room, that's not your fault. Just shitty walls.\n\nHer life and needs aren't more important than yours, and you were already there.", "NTA they ate many professions that dont work\"normal person hours\" she is an adult not a baby there are so manythings out there she cam utilize to fall asleep", "NTA - Anyone unhappy in a roommate situation has the option of moving out, imo. Also... she could get earplugs.", "INFO: was she aware of your work schedule when she moved in?", "NTA. Shouldn't be just you making the compromise. She knew your working hours before moving in. Ear plugs or a white noise machine are great investments.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your job and she knew your hours before she moved in. Either she needs to learn to sleep through it, move, or she can start paying you your entire salary you are missing by not being able to work.", "Info, please\n\nDoes she ever wake you up in the morning when she's getting ready for her ungodly early hour job?", "NTA- But still you have to realize that it's not YOUR apartment. You should speak with her that you can compromise bit she have to compromise too, once it's not HER apartment too.\nThere is one thing, if you are already offering to pay for the rent, what don't you rent another one of the same value?", "NTA. Also she just moved in. You\u2019ve been living there for a year and a half. She\u2019s free to find other housing", "Nta she's the one who moved in after you. Also up at 5 am is reeeeealy pushing the 'normal people' hours.   You can both wear headphones and she can turn on a fan or white noise machine.", "NTA. She can and should buy ear plugs. She came into an existing situation, it is for her to fix. You aren't throwing loud parties or watching TV with the volume at max. You are working, probably with headphones. She is being unreasonable.", "NTA - I would judge differently if these were personal calls, but this is your work, and you were there first.", "NTA.  You aren't blaring the TV or music late at night. You're talking on the phone because it's your job. That is not an unreasonable noise. \n\nPeople who are light sleepers often can't sleep well in apartment style living because there can be random noises from multiple sources, late night workers pulling into the parking lot and opening/closing the main door and their entry doors, crying babies, dogs barking, running showers and dishwashers. The person who is suffering through interrupted sleep needs to figure out solutions, starting with ear plugs and white noise, ending with moving to a more private location. \n\nI say this as a long time night shift worker who had to sleep working around people who made louder daytime noises.", "NAH. Both of you have wildly different schedules and it's understandable that this causes some friction. You're both living in this place for free, so you have to either make it work or move out. \n\nCan you shift your work schedule at all? Can you install any soundproofing? Can you get your sister some nice earplugs or a white noise machine? You both just have to compromise and find a solution that works for the two of you while you're both living in the same house.", "NAH\n\nYou were there first, and you have a right to your livelihood. Your job requires you to talk and requires those hours.\n\nYou mentioned it's a familial house so she has a right to it too. And she needs her sleep.\n\nWhat workarounds have you tried? Can you rearrange what rooms you're in? Maybe if you work on an opposite side of the house from where she sleeps? Can she try ear plugs or white noise? Maybe soundproof the walls and/or door?\n\nI used to be such a light sleeper than someone talking in the next room, even on TV, would keep me awake all night, it sucks.", "NAH\n\nYou both have very reasonable concerns. Maybe you could try getting some sound dampening furniture. Assuming that your rooms are adjacent, you could also open the door and let the sound spill into the rest of the apartment instead of bouncing around in your room.

I've been looking for a few months, just in case, but there's a really serious housing crisis currently and even though I'm currently living in a very small town, rent is through the roof.

I do try to be as quiet as I can, especially because I wear a headset, and my bedroom door is closed at all times when I work which helps a lot with sound isolation here.\n\nI also have tried putting towels on the floor just to cover up any cracks under the door, but she leaves her bedroom door ajar so her cats can go in and out so that really puts a damper on sound isolation (although understandable, as her cats do need to use their litter box at night sometimes).\n\nEDIT: HAPPY CAKE DAY! \ud83c\udf70", "Being a light sleeper is not OP\u2019s problem to fix.", "Why?
