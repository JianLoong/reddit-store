Where was he in all this? There is so much missing information. \n\nIt sounds like you were his dad for most of his life, starting as a toddler. You bear responsibility for how he was raised. If your wife didn\u2019t let you be a parent, then the dynamic was messed up from the beginning. You\u2019re either on the same page with parenting, so your participation is needed and welcomed, or you have extremely different views on parenting and I question whether you should have ever been together raising kids in the first place. \n\nIs Alice Nora\u2019s mom? Where the hell is she in this situation as relates to her daughter? Are you telling me she stood by while her son assaulted her daughter? She was obviously put into a nightmare situation but I\u2019m having a very difficult time with this. \n\nObviously there was a divorce, and part of that process was a detailed discussion of money. Your ex should have inquired as to the college fund at that time. You should have advised them that the college fund would not be for Kai any longer as it sounds like he knew it existed and theoretically you knew he was relying on it. \n\nAnd how long ago was the divorce? If it was years ago then they had years to change spending habits and approach education funding completely differently. Fiscal planning is part of the process. They are AH for not taking responsibility. \n\nIf abuse was the reason for the split, why wasn\u2019t Kai prosecuted? Why is he going on his merry way to college at all when he assaulted his sister? The victim, his sister, has to live with the consequences of his actions. He needs accountability. \n\nThere\u2019s no way on earth I\u2019d support my child\u2019s abuser. I wouldn\u2019t pay for his college either. But I would have said so during the divorce when money was being discussed. \n\nThe problem here is the abuser is also your kid. You should have had parental discussions with him as part of investigating what happened with your daughter. So he should know where he stands with you as part of that discussion. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge mess and I\u2019m so sorry for everyone involved.  The whole situation is totally f\u2019d up. \n\nBut the sheer gall to think that there will be no consequences for abusing your sister and you get to go to an expensive college on a free ride is infuriating. He should have realized he irrecoverably changed his life the second he abused his sister. And if he didn\u2019t get it then, he should have after the divorce. \n\nIn run of the mill divorces (where there has been no abuse) it would be beyond shitty for an adult to say or feel they weren\u2019t a parent of their step kid and feel like it\u2019s ok to just rip out the support system and take away the college fund. In that situation it would be beyond AH to take the money. \n\nBUT this isn\u2019t run of the mill. There was abuse. There should be consequences (and a lot more than having to pay for your own college). The removal of the fund should have been discussed and frankly assumed on their part so ESH.", "There\u2019s not enough info, but I\u2019m going with ESH (except Nora). Kai is def an AH for how he treated Nora. From the comments it sounds like you divorced for Nora\u2019s safety - and good for you for doing that. But, it\u2019s really not clear how you stepped in when Kai\u2019s abusive behavior started. There were no signs, no one ever brought it up, no noticeable changes in the kids relationship?? You parented Kai for 15 years, from the time that he was 3, and instead of intervening you just decided you don\u2019t like him anymore. It feels like there\u2019s something missing here. \n\nI experienced sibling abuse. My parents didn\u2019t do anything even though I pleaded with them for years. What happened and how long it went on for is their fault as much as it is my brother\u2019s. And, they failed him too.", "INFO: What was done to address the bullying? \"Bullying\" between siblings is common, and sometimes it does get physical. But, I'm gathering from the comments that this was closer to actual sibling abuse, which indicates criminal activity or mental health issues (which are much harder to address after 18 unless something results in court ordered therapy when they're an adult...).\n\nI was promised a college fund and to this day have no idea what happened to it. (It wasn't a punishment; it was just gone and I was told it has never existed even though I had been told about it since I was a young kid.) I believe it was spent as it was never put directly in my name for some reason. \n\nIt made things MUCH harder for me and continues to affect my life 20ish years later because, as a legal child, I didn't understand what I was signing loan-wise. All I knew was that my school counselors said it was \"the best way\" and would \"go away after only a few years.\" Neither is true.\n\nSo, it needs to have been REALLY bad AND not have stopped after you, the legal guardian, intervened to make sure HE was getting effective help.", "YTA\n\nYou set the money aside for him.", "YTA - you may not be married to his mom anymore, but the fund was for him. It will also put a further divider between himself and his half-sister.  Or may promote further bullying. Up until a year ago you were a form of a parental figure with him. You didn't say anything about the specifics of the bullying, but they are siblings and siblings fight. They also went through this divorce too, and maybe there is an aspect to that which has hurt him. So in the name of not promoting further sibling fights between them, do as promised and go with that.", "YTA:  He was your son. (Really still is), and you put this aside for him and told him this would be available when the day comes that he goes to college.  Kids fight, sometimes bully each other, they learn to work it out.  It is wrong of you to withhold from him the money you told him was set aside for him for college.  Regards how you feel about their fighting or such, this was for him.  Be a better parent!", "YTA if Kai\u2019s mother was a SAHM because the money you set aside for Kai wasn\u2019t just your money, it was your ex wife\u2019s money as well. Yes, you earned the money, but she did too by working for you.", "YTA. You\u2019re playing favorites because you\u2019re divorced from Kai\u2019s mom. Up until a year ago, you were planning on giving him money for college. He knew this and expected this. Now you\u2019re pulling the rug out from under him, which is a messed up thing to do to a teenage stepson. Why didn\u2019t you tell him not to expect the money before now?\n\nTeenagers can be jerks. Punishing jerkish behavior by preventing him from going to college is like using an atom bomb when a time-out would suffice. This could directly affect his whole life and future - especially when you consider that his jerkish behavior is likely a direct result of your divorce. He\u2019s probably acting out because of his feelings about the divorce. He should talk to a therapist rather than have his whole future destroyed. You divorce adults; you don\u2019t divorce kids. \n\nAlso, I can\u2019t help but think the real reason you\u2019re doing this isn\u2019t because of Nora. This is just another way to get back at Alice.

If that is true, than that may excuse your behavior, but it would have to be pretty bad to do so.
