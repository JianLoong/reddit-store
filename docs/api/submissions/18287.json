But to be fair, You have no idea of the type of bullying Kai was doing to his daughter so..\nBecause if Kai happen to touch her in any inappropriate way.. Then that line is understandable..", "Not if OP was suffering from the Step-Parent Effect and Alice refused to allow him to discipline Kai.\n\nAlso according to others OP said Kai was actually physically abusive and that the sub's rules prevent him from going into detail.", "I understand that bullying is severe and Kai should be punished in some way shape or form. \n\nBut OP also admits that Kai looked at him as a father figure but somehow distances himself from having any responsibility in the way Kai was raised. When evidence shows obviously he cared enough about Kai to create a college fund and his marriage lasted for 15 years. \n\nI totally understand OP\u2019s willingness to put his child\u2019s needs and safety first. But I think OP is not owning his part in how this situation played out and instead is just sort of callously cutting ties with his former step son. Like he could have *at least* told them he wasn\u2019t receiving it. \n\nKai learned that behavior from someone.", "According to the comments, OP claims Kai physically abused his daughter and can't go into specifics due to the sub rules", "If his daughter needs to be in therapy as a result of Kai's actions, then yes, separating her from her abuser ASAP by divorcing his mom and denouncing Kai is very much protecting her.", "Lol that\u2019s what divorce court is for.", "She is not my wife anymore. She is not entitled to anything I got after our divorce", "wtf?? Kai is physically abusing OP's daughter and you think OP's the devil for not wanting to pay for the abuser's education??", "You think this man is a demon because he won\u2019t give money to his daughter\u2019s abuser?! Bad take.", "He's awful for not paying for college for the person who abused his kid? Nah", "It\u2019s in his comments so you don\u2019t have to read between the lines", "You know what I did? I divorced his mom asap. I'm not going to try to \"change\" him while my daughter suffers", "So you would give money to someone that physically abused your child?", ">he\u2019s said Kai physically bullied his daughter\n\nHe also said he can't elaborate due to the sub's rules. I don't think it's \"bullying\", sounds more like assault. Physical or...other.", "So you are administering consequences now. What about before now?", "You've raised him since he was 3 but you don't think it's your job to parent him?", "I didn't even realize there's a no violence rule. That rule seems a bit extreme", "And you made sure if thar by making sure to have a prenup and then making sure you were the \"breadwinner\". You made sure to keep a tight control over her.  This is just your way of maintaining control over him.", "He posted that comment after I made this comment. \n\nThat kind of info should have obviously been in the post.", "Given on how you've been speaking to people throughout this thread and your fundamental unwillingness to take accountability for raising a child, it sounds like he learnt all his problematic behavior by emulating you.", "Youre a good dad to you daughter. Idc about being a good dad to your ex stepson because he lost all my sympathy when he abused your daughter", "Change him from the person he became while you are raising him for most of his life?\n\nTake some responsibility!", "Sometimes step parents don't really get that choice. They may have these kids in their house but hands are tied when they try to discipline.", "Oooof. Good one!"]}
