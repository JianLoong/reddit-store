He didn\u2019t even look for a job the first 6 months he was here and instead complained about the internet not being top notch for him so he could play his games (literally all he did for those first 6 months!!) . \n\nHe was so mentally draining to live with and be around constantly that there were numerous occasions I would literally be crying to my family and close family friends that I couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore and I felt trapped and like I wasn\u2019t allowed to have a life without him(I wasn\u2019t allowed any friends, regardless of gender, if they weren\u2019t his friends too).\n\nNow onto the title of this post.

Live a brighter life without their bullshit.", "NTA, even if he wasn\u2019t abusive they should be choosing you over your ex, and not inviting you so that they can invite him is insane", "YWNBTA but, as you've seen, it would be futile. They've already made their choice. Abusers can be very charming.\n\nHindsight is 20/20, but instead of begging him to leave, you should have evicted him.", "You can tell them, but they will not care. They have chosen your abuser and had chosen him before you were able to get him out of your house. The good news is that you know this now and can focus on what makes you happy and building the found family you deserve. Go no contact for your own sake. In that case, you won't be hoping or expecting them to reach out, and you won't be constantly hurt by the fact that they don't. This way, you'll have taken charge of your own life and taken action for yourself. I'm sorry your family is making such a crappy choice, but you've done well to get rid of him and getting therapy. Keep up the good work. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's not weird to be upset that you are being excluded from family gatherings.", "YWNBTA\n\nIt isn't weird for you to be upset.

I\u2019ve been NC with my sister since she sided with my abusive ex in our divorce. It\u2019s hard on my parents, but when they mention it, I tell them to take it up with the woman who decided hanging out with the man who repeatedly SA\u2019d me was acceptable behavior.  It shuts them right up.", "Unfortunately I have told them this and was made to feel like I was overreacting because i \u201cinvited him into their lives\u201d", "I am due to talk to one of my family members about this tomorrow. I\u2019ve already dropped out of several family events and only been to 1 since the whole breakup and that was because I was specifically told he wasn\u2019t even invited. No matter how the talk goes I\u2019m going to tell them tomorrow that I\u2019m not going to see them at Christmas as I\u2019ll be going to a close friends instead were I feel a lot more comfortable.", "That\u2019s the mindset I had when I first ended things and then I found out a month or two later they had told me to \u201cdelay coming back\u201d so they could invite him and they all told me I was acting crazy", "Unfortunately I still live with my parents and we rent this place so I don\u2019t even know how we would have gone about that. I was also totally alone in this as my family that I lived refused to get involved at all and when I asked for help they straight up said no", "Thank you. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say at this point, I know the decision is going to hurt to cut them off but I am starting to see that it is what\u2019s for the best unfortunately:(", "I honestly think the main thing I want is for them to realise just how much they\u2019ve hurt me because at this point it feels like they either don\u2019t care at all or haven\u2019t realised.

I \n\nI don\u2019t want to go no contact with them as it would be very difficult for me and the family that I live with probably wouldn\u2019t support it but i know it\u2019s for the best at this point. \n\nAnd thank you, my own counsellor is just through work as it\u2019s impossible to get one at the moment even if I went private.

Just remember, family are the people who have your back. Sometimes, they are related to you by blood. Sometimes, they are people you meet along the way.

We both do.", "I think at this point it is unfortunately true", "I think I\u2019m just really upset that they immediately made out that I was the crazy one. I had some real bad mental health issues almost 10years ago due to the environment I grew up in and it feels like whenever I don\u2019t agree with them they immediately resort to telling me I\u2019m crazy but now I\u2019m typing that out I\u2019m realising how messed up that is!!", "If i were you, I would have a talk where I say everything he did to me at once so they understand the magnitude, and tell them you aren\u2019t comfortable with being around him, so you won\u2019t contact them or be seeing them until they cut contact with him. Either they will soon cut him off to see you, or you dodged a bullet and can have toxic people out of your life.", "I\u2019m due to talk to one of them tomorrow and I think I will do that! Thank you for the advice, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that I left out of this post as well that he did and I feel like I\u2019ll need to bring up everything to truly try and get through to them. It sucks as well because these close family friends were my found family and they used to constantly say I was the daughter that they never had but then they said they weren\u2019t getting involved and continued to be around him"]}
