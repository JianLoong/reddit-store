On top of asking you do this mental labor for him, he's then rude and petulant about it. The issue is not his annoyance at chores and if you should approach things differently. The issue is that it is a privilege for him to rely on you to do all this mental labor for him, and in spite of that he acts like a middle schooler about it. \n\nIf you love and truly want to be with this man, you need to set some boundaries. That could look like having him set up calendar reminders and alarms to be fully responsible for 50% of the household tasks, or it could look like him needing to respond in a certain way if you're going to continue reminding him. If this relationship matters to you, sit down and think about how these behaviors will make you feel 10, 20 years from now.

Your husband is being a petulant, work-avoiding, misogynist asshole.

No, nope, nuh-uh. He is being a major asshole. You shouldn't have to ask him to do chores; you shouldn't be the only one who can \"see mess.\"", "NTA. I have a partner who has ADHD and genuinely needs to be reminded. I also got tired of his annoyance. So what we ended up doing was making a chore chart! We have certain chores for certain days, break days and stickers. We each have our own chores on our own days. We both have 2 \u201cchore free\u201d days usually on our days off but whatever works for you two. And it has immensely helped our relationship. He has the same chores every week and there\u2019s no excuse on chores being missed no guilt for being \u201cnagging.\u201d And we both love adding a sticker to our respective charts.", "If you want to take the tit-for-tat approach:\n\nHim: \u201cUgg, really?\u201d\nYou: \u201cYes, really.

Guess you should call the police then.\u201d\n\nIf he thinks those sarcastic retorts are funny, awesome. If he gets \u201csensitive\u201d about his them, it is an empathy opportunity. This should only be done with a plan to have dialogue, not as a chess move. \n\nNTA", "He has made it your responsibility and therefore the dynamic is your the nag and he is the victim.

It makes me vomit.", "NTA - tell him you signed up for a husband not a teenage son. Also \u201cyour killing me\u201d is not a statement of frustration at doing a chore, it\u2019s a statement of frustration at the person asking him to do the chore, so he is flat out lying about what he\u2019s doing.", "NTA are you his mum or his wife?", "YTA. You have accepted the lie that you are better at chores than he is and you have a better sense of when they need to be done. You know what people do when they need to improve, they practice till they get it right. Tell husband to start practicing. He's an adult who probably can figure out various complex processes, figuring out when the laundry needs doing or the dishes need washing should be fairly simple for him. He's making it as unpleasant as possible when you do ask him to do something, this will discourage you from asking.\n\nThis isn't about you being sensitive, it's about him deliberately making you as guilty and feeling as unpleasant as possible so he avoids chores. He's not incapable, he's unwilling to put any effort into it. You're playing along with his incompetent fantasy to avoid tackling the harder issue of making him responsible for being an adult in a shared household.", "ESH\n\nThis is a dynamic that needs both of you working together to overcome, if you can.  His reactions making you feel guilty is a \"you\" issue.  No matter how he means it, you don't have to react to or internalize it.  \nThat's the easy part.  The hard part will be the two of you coming to an agreement on chores overall.  Right now, he's being enabled to be helpless by you staying on top of everything or picking up his slack.  I've been where you are, and it doesn't get better until both of you sit down and have an open discussion about chores and expectations.   Once an agreement is made, the hard part is letting it stand.  Don't remind him, and don't pick up any slack.  If there are certain things you can't handle, agree to own that and trade for something else.  Me?  I can't cook if there are dirty dishes in the sink.  Since I enjoy cooking, dishes fall to me more often.  That's okay, there are other items my husband feels more strongly about, those are what he owns.\nGood luck, this can be a great exercise in communication for your marriage.", "That\u2019s just so embarrassing on his part?? Personally I would show him these comments I think he needs a reality check", "NTA.\n\nBut how about expressing your annoyance as well?

Frustration at having to act like an adult and equal partner shouldn\u2019t be validated. Ever. It is not a reasonable response.\n\nIt is the response of a child.\n\nAnd what an absolute hypocrit that he tells you that you need to work on your sensitivity, while a 3 minute chore leads to him whining.", "Maybe he could set reminders on his phone or Alexa to do some specific chores that need doing on a regular basis.

You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA \n\nI cannot express how grateful I am for my husband. I'm no longer able to do many chores, I do what I'm able, it just takes longer. My husband, bless him, works at a very physical job and does almost all the chores now. He doesn't like it and complains occasionally, especially when he's exhausted.

This is his attempt at weaponized incompetence (please look it up).  \n\n\nYou are not wrong by taking it personally when he rants.

What else is she supposed to be insensitive to? What\u2019s the end game? Them both ignoring each other?", "NTA\n\nLol I\u2019m all for encouraging men to express their feelings, but this is just whining. Your husband is an adult who shouldn\u2019t be saying things like \u201coh come on\u201d in response to basic household chores. He shouldn\u2019t need the reminder. He should just remember what he has to do and do it. He can set reminders on his phone or something to take that extra burden off you. And it is a burden. You having to remind him is an extra chore for you and it is an unfair division of household labor. The least you can do is ask him to not whine like an 8 year old in response to basic tasks. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried couples counseling, please consider it. This may seem like minor annoyance but it\u2019s a major red flag in terms of maturity and communication skills.\n\nEdit just to add that feeling like a husband treats you like a maid or his mom is one of the fastest routes to you losing all sexual and romantic interest in him. He should be aware of that.", "Your husband is a lazy asshole and with all the whingeing and moaning he wants you to stop asking him to help out at all.

He\u2019s lazy and sees this as beneath him.\n\nWhy do you want a life partner that doesn\u2019t want to lift a finger to clean up after himself and contribute to running a home he lives in?", "Get an app like Sweepy. It divides chores and reminds you to do them.", "NTA. Come on! He's a grown man, stop babying him. Do you think he forgets his assignments at work too? No?

I couldn't have sex with someone who behaved this way, much less someone who somehow made it my fault that they can't function as an adult. I'm not sure I could recover from the 'ick' from this.
