On top of asking you do this mental labor for him, he's then rude and petulant about it. The issue is not his annoyance at chores and if you should approach things differently. The issue is that it is a privilege for him to rely on you to do all this mental labor for him, and in spite of that he acts like a middle schooler about it. \n\nIf you love and truly want to be with this man, you need to set some boundaries. That could look like having him set up calendar reminders and alarms to be fully responsible for 50% of the household tasks, or it could look like him needing to respond in a certain way if you're going to continue reminding him. If this relationship matters to you, sit down and think about how these behaviors will make you feel 10, 20 years from now.

You shouldn't have to bend over backwards and tie yourself in knots by doing 85% of a chore for him, and then ask him when would be the most convenient time to remind him so he doesn't get angry about being reminded to contribute to his own damn household.\n\nHe's being an asshole on purpose to get out of doing any work, and he expects you to be his mommy and pick up after him... and that if he whines enough about it, eventually he won't have to do chores anymore.", "NTA\n\nSo\u2026 He can express annoyance but you can\u2019t?\n\nPersonally I think y\u2019all need another system.

He needs to identify why he isn't recognizing the mess and she needs to figure out why pointing it out makes her feel guilty.\n\nSupport each other. Lots of shadow work needed here. Don't get to the point where OP just does all the chores to avoid the guilt from reminding him and then is secretly resentful. Her husband isn't gonna know wtf happened to their relationship when she one day feels fed up \"living with a child\".  None of this is AH behavior yet since he still does his share and this situation is very common with a lot of married couples."]}
