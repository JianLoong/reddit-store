On top of asking you do this mental labor for him, he's then rude and petulant about it. The issue is not his annoyance at chores and if you should approach things differently. The issue is that it is a privilege for him to rely on you to do all this mental labor for him, and in spite of that he acts like a middle schooler about it. \n\nIf you love and truly want to be with this man, you need to set some boundaries. That could look like having him set up calendar reminders and alarms to be fully responsible for 50% of the household tasks, or it could look like him needing to respond in a certain way if you're going to continue reminding him. If this relationship matters to you, sit down and think about how these behaviors will make you feel 10, 20 years from now.
