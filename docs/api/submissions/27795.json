I\u2019m a psychologist and several of my clients are in therapy because their abusive/controlling spouses insisted on it. The abuser likes to make *you* feel like the problem and they often weaponize the fact you\u2019re in therapy to make you seem unstable or irrational. I\u2019m not sure if your partner has done that yet, but I suspect he eventually will. \n\nI\u2019m also in therapy myself for PTSD. My partner would *never* ask what I talk about. He just asks \u201chow\u2019d it go?\u201d And that\u2019s all a supportive partner *should* be asking. \n\nKeep going to therapy and keep working on yourself. Therapy is hard af because you\u2019re intentionally digging into your most painful thoughts and feelings - but the more that you do it, the stronger you\u2019ll feel. Eventually, you\u2019ll feel secure enough to set boundaries   Eventually, you\u2019ll value yourself enough to see that you don\u2019t need to tolerate abuse. It takes time, but you can get there. \n\nFinally, I\u2019m not sure if anyone had recommended this yet, but consider checking out \u201cWhy Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\u201d By Lundy Bancroft. He works with abusive men and he really breaks down how their thinking and beliefs work. (Small warning tho - this book is actually what triggered my PTSD. I was abused throughout my childhood but didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until I read this book. So just make sure you have lots of coping tools from your therapist before you peruse it) \n\nGood luck OP", "Not that unusual. Note that he insisted on *you* attending. Not marriage counseling and he\u2019s terrified you talk about him. \n\nHe wanted you to go to therapy to feel like you were the \u201cbroken\u201d one.

Guess it was all to show support to get me to go\n\nI\u2019ve wanted therapy for so long and he isn\u2019t going to take this away from me.
