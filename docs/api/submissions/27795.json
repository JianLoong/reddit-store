You just know it too? \n\nStart your prep to get out, and I don't mean half ass it and think \"what if I tell him and he changes\"..I mean, make alternative arrangements for where you're gonna live, how it'll budget, the impact on your life being solo, what you need to pack, take or ensure he doesn't have access to(and can any of it be done in advance and unnoticed, like packing a 2-3 day bag and leaving it at parents house, moving important paperwork, changing passwords on emails and making a list of what you need)", "NTA. \n\nLie.

Get your documents ready and secure and out of the house. Anything sentimental too. Gather a support system for yourself, you're going to need them. Contact lawyers and ask advice on how to get out of this marriage. If you think he'll get physical, ask a local DV shelter for help.
