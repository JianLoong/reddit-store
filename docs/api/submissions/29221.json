I put my head down and walk from our bedroom to our kitchen. She follows me and goes, \" Let's talk about it\". I told her there was nothing I wanted to say. She goes, \" Yes there is, I'm too fat for these pants\". I said, \" You said that, not me\". She continues, \" Obviously, I need to buy bigger pants, correct? But I can't, because bigger pants will only result in me becoming bigger\". I told her it was her call. \n\nShe snaps and says, \" God forbid you pitch in here. Jesus Christ.\" I asked her if she really wanted me to just go the full way and say to her, \" Wow, you're really getting to be a big ol' fat ass huh?\" because it seems like that's what she wants me to say.

Nothing you could have said in the moment would have made her feel better in this situation. \nI think she was embarrassed by you seeing her struggle with putting her pants on.

Yes, you could have not ventilated back at her, but I understand your frustration.", "NTA\n\nshe's projecting. I don't see why someone struggling into the pants needs any sort of commentary honestly, so to me, you didn't even avoid the conversation back then because there was no need for a conversation. \n\nAnd I don't blame you for being evasive when she came after you kind of aggressively. I think at that point you and all of us knew, that there was really nothing you could say to satisfy her completely. \n\nBut honestly this is just a little spat between you two, the big battle goes inside her with herself it seems :(", "Your wife wants to know that you love her, regardless of her jean size. \n\nShe wants you to tell her that it doesn\u2019t make a difference in how you feel about her. \n\nShe wants you to engage in a conversation about it because otherwise, the elephant in the room is telling her she isn\u2019t worthy of the discussion, that you don\u2019t find her attractive, and that you\u2019re embarrassed to be with her. \n\nFigure out how to tell her how you feel about her. And take her shopping for comfy clothes that fit. There are lots of things out there that fill the gap between uncomfortable, too small jeans and sweatpants. Help her find something that makes her feel beautiful and comfortable, because who she is matters more than what her waistline measurement is. \n\nWe all come in different shapes and sizes. \nBut I am firmly convinced that all anyone wants, deep down, is to know they are loved, wanted, and respected for Who they are inside the shell we wear. \n\nI vote NTA for not understanding, but your actions going forward now in this situation will determine your true A status", "NTA. I've struggled with my weight too, although I've finally managed to get and keep it down now.\n\nShe was projecting. She was embarrassed that she couldn't fit into her jeans, and embarrassed that you saw her not fitting into them. She didn't want to sit in those feelings, so she picked a fight.\n\nIt's not up to you to decide if she should buy bigger pants. She's a grown-up, that's up to her. The only thing I ever asked of my husband was that he stopped buying me treats (the things that were only for me and he wouldn't eat anyway). Other than that, it was all on me to figure out my diet, and to get some exercise.\n\nIn a supportive relationship it never hurts to ask if there's anything you can do to help/support if she wants to lose weight. Like avoiding buying too much junk, agreeing to have healthier meals, offering to exercise together. You don't have to, but if you want to help, that's about the most you can do.\n\nBut it really is up to her, it isn't your responsibility and you can't control what she chooses to eat or what exercise she does or doesn't want to do.", "NTA. I\u2019m really not sure what she was expecting & it sure does feel like she was trying to get you to say she\u2019s fat. What are you supposed to be pitching in about?

You not giving your opinion on her weight (looking, avoiding eye contact and then leaving the room) makes her think that you\u2019re unhappy with her weight. She wants your input because you\u2019re not giving it.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to have uncomfortable talks, sometimes things need to be said. In this situation, it\u2019s very likely that she was afraid of how you felt regarding her weight gain. Your lack of communication further propelled this because it made her believe that you\u2019re avoiding the conversation.\n\nIm wondering what your feelings regarding her weight gain actually are? Because you don\u2019t really explain it. Why are you ignoring the subject of her weight gain so much? Is it because she has a habit of blowing up?\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s open about topics surrounding her weight, probably means that she\u2019s had insecurities issues about it before, and is mature enough to discuss them with you (someone she trusts)\nI don\u2019t think you meant to come across the way you did, but to me (an outsider, so take it with a grain of salt) it seems like you\u2019re purposely avoiding the conversation to not share your real thoughts on the matter.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH - and she\u2019s obviously struggling with her weight and probably self esteem That said: \n\nWhy did you put your head down leave quickly?

She needs a therapist. \n\nAnd buying bigger pants doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll just gain weight, she sounds like she\u2019s trying to play a victim here and I don\u2019t understand the logic.", "NTA, but I think she may have been looking for some sort of moral support from you.  if there is a next time, perhaps ask her gently if there is anything you can do to help, like going for walks with her, or doing some of the grocery shopping so she is not exposed as much to some of her \u201ctrigger\u201d foods. Let her know that you are not judging her but that you are there for her to help her if you can, but she needs to tell you how you can do that.", "Why is she making her weight a joint project between you two?

Probably support along with the honesty.  I always told my SO's that their job is to make sure i don't go out looking like an idiot, not to protect my feelings.  Obviously though, some people like to be lied to.   \n\nI usually ask kids and expect my feelings to be hurt lol.  Some of the opinions they share are hilarious tbh", "NTA, she was obviously bothered by it and took it out on you. She probably thinks you\u2019re thinking about it and just won\u2019t say anything so she says things first.\n\nI think people over estimate how much work it is to lose weight when you\u2019re that big which is why she says she wants to deal with it but it doesn\u2019t seem to be improving.", "NTA because reading this, I don't know what she wants from you either...  \nDoes she want you to agree that she's fat? Does she want you to allow her to just give up and get bigger pants? I don't see how you COULD navigate this without getting into trouble, as it were.

Having said that, my weight ballooned after a surgery due to medication and me binge eating my feelings. Throughout that year my husband was extremely supportive about my weight and said he couldn\u2019t see it or it didn\u2019t matter. In hindsight, I think I exploited that, and some hard truth from him would\u2019ve helped me snap out of it and get myself under control sooner than I did.

You tried to avoid it, she pressed", "NTA. This is so me!  Sweetheart, this is a something I've struggled with for years. I get frustrated and angry with myself, and when you see me in these vulnerable moments; I am ashamed and embarrassed on top of that. I am full to the brim with these negative emotions and I lash out at you in my venting process. I know it's not your fault, and that I'm not being fair, but I am not in my 'logical headspace' in those moments; just so overwhelmed. You are my 'safe' person who still loves me when you've seen my worst, so I don't hold back when I should. *So sorry, so very, very sorry*.     OP, you are not a mind-reader, and what she 'needs to hear' from you in these moments may vary depending on where she was mentally/emotionally 'at' - sometimes it's reassurance that her appearance doesn't matter, sometimes it's encouragement, sometimes it may be pretending you saw nothing.

I don't care about you gaining a few pounds, I'd still love you if you grew tentacles, you're beautiful and perfect.  I've often thought about establishing a religion to extoll your virtues.\"\n\nAnd that's what you flipping say.  \n\nI've *also* had the uncomfortable conversation, going both ways, when we engaged in unhealthy eating/drinking/not working out habits.

Agree that it's her call what to do moving forward", "I think she feels a lot of frustration about her weight and unloaded it on me", "I avoid it because with her, the trend is Bash Herself, Change Nothing.

You mention again what happens to her, but what about you? Does it annoy you? Baffle you? Make you uncomfortable?

Is this the first time or a constant? To what point is this topic avoided? Does he physically remove himself from the situation, or verbally expresses it? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t excuse her actions, because ultimately taking her anger out on OP isn\u2019t a solution. But it\u2019s a possibility that she\u2019s just frustrated about not being able to talk about it to him (again, this is just an outsiders prospective, I have zero clue of their daily discussions, so she very well could just be picking fights for no reason) but that\u2019s just my alternative thought! This whole thing screams therapy/counselling though.", "But why are you scared of having that conversation? Are you ashamed? Does she get upset every time she talks about it? Are you ashamed?", "You realise that rushing out of the room for such a silly reason is exactly what sparked the conversation in the first place, right?\n\n\nYou can't avoid uncomfortable conversations with your spouse.

It's not about her weight. It's about the way you BOTH approach these conversations. You try to avoid them, she seems to chase you down. That's not healthy or sustainable.", "Not to be too personal, you don't have to reply. Just think about it.\nHow often do you treat her like she's sexy? Not just saying it, but treating her as such? \nThat can make a big difference in her confidence.", "That doesn't always work. Nutritionist put me on a calorie counting app years ago.

If she makes auch a big fuss about it she might aswell work on it. She's completely lost in her mental cage she build for herself. She set clear rules for the lock to it. Go get the key.

Especially that you still find her attractive no matter what", "Good job to you for not actually caring about her weight gain, it sounds more like you care about her bashing herself. Maybe you guys can try therapy for her self esteem, that will help her because she\u2019s looking to you for validation that she can\u2019t give herself right now. \n\nAlso gym dates! Maybe she will respond better if you guys work out together more! Start by going for walks together and if she gets offended when you ask her to walk with her, say it\u2019s for you and that you could use some company but don\u2019t force her, make it seem nonchalant like \u201coh, wanna go for a walk after dinner? Im feeling like I need to walk that food off\u201d and if she asks if this is about her weight shift the conversation to you and just say you \u201cwanted to get out a little together and get some fresh air and also get a calm workout in. \u201c This should help her but I really encourage these two options because therapy works wonders and exercise makes you feel really good about yourself and it improves the quality of your life both mentally and physically.", "So say that instead of saying nothing. You didn't do anything *wrong.* Far from it. But this will keep happening if one of you doesn't break the cycle.

I asked whether you liked the way she looks but by you avoiding to give a clear answer I can See what you think.\nThis is something she picks up on. She senses that you prefer her being thinner and you cannot avoid this conversation now. She wants you to answer honestly and by doing so you might ruin your relationship.\nLosing weight is absolutely not easy, it's about doing sports, eating way less/ different to before and a lot of discipline.
