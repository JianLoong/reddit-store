He\u2019s a very handsome man and thus had a reputation as a bit of a fuck boy. By our sophomore year John started hanging out with this girl named Kelly. Kelly is a nice girl, but it was obvious to everyone that she was absolutely smitten with John, and by that I mean obsessed. She told everyone her and John were meant to be, but John wasn\u2019t interested in her like that. In fact he was far more interested in her roommate Amanda.\n\nLong story short, John and Amanda got together and surprisingly fell in love. This caused some friction between Kelly and Amanda but it was smoothed over. John was head over heels for Amanda and even proposed to her at her 25th birthday party, she of course said yes. However it wasn\u2019t meant to be, since Amanda was killed by a drunk driver. John was devastated, but he refused help and turned to alcohol. We begged him to go to counseling, but he just ignored us all.\nKelly swooped in and started comforting him since she happened to live close to him. Thanks to her, he seemed to have come out of it a bit, but I kept a eye on everything. I didn\u2019t like the idea of her comforting him, it seemed wrong. She was still obsessed with him, and never got over him choosing her roommate over her. \n\nWell my suspicions were correct, two years after Amanda died, Kelly proudly announced that she and John were a couple. I wasn\u2019t happy with it, but I kept it to myself. John seemed happy, so I let it go. She seemed to be more into the relationship than he was.\n \nNow just yesterday John confided in me that he wants to propose to Kelly. I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and told him that it would be a terrible idea. Kelly was obsessed with him, and he still hadn\u2019t properly processed the grief from Amanda. I asked him to name the thing he liked most about Kelly and his biggest answer was that she was there for him during his darkest period, he also said she was very kind. Maybe I\u2019m crazy, but it sounded like he just appreciated her company more than he actually liked her. I told him she wasn\u2019t right for him and I couldn\u2019t stand by and not say anything. He said I needed to butt out and let him make his own choices, he also called me an ahole.\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering reddit, am I the ahole here by telling John he and Kelly aren\u2019t good for each other?", "created_utc": 1681506643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mdkbf/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_proposing_to_his/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You say this \u201cseemed wrong\u201d but provide no reasons why. Are you jealous that she was able to get through to him when you were not?

If your friend is just making a decision you disagree with, then you probably have to let them do it. There's a way to bring up your concerns, but blurting out that his relationship is terrible the moment he wants to propose is...not it.\n\nEDIT: I also want to add that there are plenty of couples in my circle that I just *don't* understand how they got together or why they work together, but regardless of me understanding how they fit together, they still appear to be quite happy with each other.

If their relationship makes you uncomfortable it may be time to get a life of your own to study.", "YTA. Why is it any of your business? Why are you so weirdly controlling about your friend? Why do you have so many weird hangups about a person's behaviour from, what, 10 yr ago or something? The whole thing is wildly asinine and I'm wondering if your gender is omitted because you're into him.", "NAH\n\nYou shared your concern, and that\u2019s what good friends do.

He didn't ask what you thought or come to you for advice.  So yes, just to be clear YTA", "YTA all you keep saying is how John is your best friend. I call bullshit on that. Where were you when he was going through the grief of the loss of Amanda. You were obviously nowhere around so get off your high horse about Kelly. You are a massive AH for not being there for your so called best friend.  Becuase it's obvious tha he was going through it and you were not there for him. \n\nYou seem to be a know it all when in fact you don't Kelly you don't know thier relationship. Just becuase he told you that Kelly was there during his darkest time. That doesn't mean that is the whole basis of him wanting to propose to her.\n\nAnd just becuase he wanted to f*ck you in college means absolutely nothing. Doesn't mean he wants you now.

That makes you a AH again.\n\n\nIf you haven't figured it out YTA in this whole situation.", "YTA are you sure you aren\u2019t the obsessed friend?

Like it wasn't high school crush levels, it was getting to be obsession.\n\nShe only really calmed down when he started going out with Amanda, and she got pissed because she felt, Amanda \"stole her husband\". They talked it out and Kelly agreed to leave them alone, and just be friends. She even dates someone else.
