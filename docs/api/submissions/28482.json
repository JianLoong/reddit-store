How did *you* \"wake up on the wrong side of the bed\" when *she's* the one throwing a fit because she wanted to watch the tv in the living room instead of the one in her room? She could have hypothetically gently woken you to ask if you wanted to move to your bedroom where it'd probably be more comfortable, and left you if you said no. It's not like she was not able to host a party of people because you were sleeping on the couch. It was just tv, and you're sick and she's supposed to be your best friend.\n\nBy all means, she can and should stay at her mom's if your crime of being sick and being asleep on the couch is enough to offend her so much that she must leave.", "NTA\n\nThese things happen, a cold takes a lot out of you and drains your energy. I'm sure there will be a time when she will fall asleep on the couch.\n\nYou have done absolutely nothing wrong except being human.\n\nBesides it's your couch, your TV, your blinking house, she hasn't got a let to stand on. I literally don't know what the heck is wrong with your other friends calling you TA. Mind boggling.\n\nEnjoy the peace while she's gone and get yourself better x", "NTA - for multiple reasons. They're living there for free, they do not get to make demands, other than that of privacy and why do they need to use the \"big\" TV at 7 AM? Was there a LOTR marathon starting? \n\nI think it's time to talk to your friend and her boyfriend and perhaps find out what their expectations are, since they are, you know, taking up space in your house and living there for free. I hope at the very least they're paying for their own food.", "NTA, you\u2019re sick , and you fell asleep. I personally don\u2019t see what the issue is here. Sure yeah it\u2019s a communal space , but it\u2019s also your home that you said they don\u2019t even pay rent to live in?? Even if she would\u2019ve woken you up nicely just to see if you were okay or something that would be different but I think she\u2019s outta line here over something ridiculous", "NTA\n\nIt's your house. Your TV. Plus you had a cold. Using a shared space means who gets it first is there, not that you have to give up the sofa for someone else.

She didn't even ask if you were okay. I had a flat mate who once slept on the couch and I woke up to see him there. You bet I tiptoed around him after confirming he was breathing.\n\nAnyway my advice is see if she apologizes otherwise tell her to stay put.", "[deleted]", "ESH. 7 am is an appropriate time to be woken up in a shared space tbh. It\u2019s not like she came home at 3 am and wanted to watch TV or something ridiculous.

If I understand correctly from your comments, you don't charge rent, they live for free, you cook for them, and your friend \"helps\" you with cleaning \"if you can't\". Let me sum it up for you: they are guests, no space belongs to them, and they also get a free cook and maid with their free lodging. So, now they are angry you are sleeping in your own room on your own couch... what's next, you should move to the kitchen to sleep on cinders?\n\nBig news: they won't move out ever. It's clearly the girl at least has other options, like living with her mother. I guess mother's don't come with the free service, though, and probably the mom would want money. They are using you, and now they are stopping to ever be polite about it.\n\nUse the perfect opportunity she gave you to kick these ahs out. Mutual friends are welcome to host them.", "It's your house, you can fall asleep wherever when you are sick.

If she would\u2019ve woken me and said hey, you fell asleep on the couch , I was hoping to use your tv to watch something , do you feel like going in your bed ? I would\u2019ve moved no issues ! It was just the immediate aggression that threw me off", "Thank you, I don\u2019t like to pull the whole mine mine mine thing , the only reason I added it is I felt it would be relevant to getting a proper judgement. I don\u2019t mind sharing , I let her stay with me if my own free will but she made me feel so bad , I had hardly woken up and felt worse than the night before (privacy from sleeping on the couch LOL) I just wanna make sure I wasn\u2019t being an AH because I was so confused", "I\u2019m a professional chef , and I do a lot of the cooking (it\u2019s just easier to make bigger portions so they can eat too) but they do use the disability money they get to put towards buying food items and such.

This is your freaking house that you are presumably paying mortgage and utilities for.  And are letting her stay at far below market rates with her partner, no less.  And that her deciding to stay elsewhere is not the power move that she thinks it is.   I believe that means she has voluntarily vacated the premises--check local law for that--and now can be evicted far easier.\n\nI suspect that she might be resenting or be disappointed with her current financial circumstances.  You got the blame when she snapped.", "Someone has gotten a bit too comfortable. I think your only issue is you're too nice.", "She sounds ungrateful and you should kick her out. She's disrespecting you in YOUR home!\n\nShe's using you and not even trying to be a decent guest. \n\nAvoid future drama and get her out!", "in all honesty it sounds like she is using you , and she is not your roommate , she is a guest . \ni know it's a difficult position to be in . i'm unsure about the laws where you live but it might be a real pain trying to evict them later . \nis she in school , have a job , have long term goals like getting her own place . it seems like she's getting really comfortable .", "Could it be that you never got annoyed with each other because you are very tolerant (as your post and comments show) and that you were behaving within the spectrum that your \"best friend\" found to be tolerable. This episode was not within that spectrum hence the tantrum. I have experienced this with people who are manipulative - as long as you behave exactly how they want, you'd think they are amazing.

Mine would be to gently wake my *friend* up and  ask them if they're alright and if they would like to move back to their bed where it's more comfortable.\n\nSome people can pretend to be nice for a very long time, especially when they need something from you. When they show you who they really are you should believe them. Sure they're having a shitty time and down on their luck but so? Shitty people can have shitty times too. It doesn't excuse them to be so rude. There are plenty of people who can have a bad day, week, month, year,  entire life and still be nice to people.\n\nWhy are you their punching bag?\n\nLet me also add that not fighting for 20 years with a friend doesn't mean much when there were no intertwined interests.
