They need to calm down and learn patience.", "NTA - replace tickets with invoices for your time... They'll beg for the tickets back!", "NTA.  It is very inconsiderate of them to think that you are going to be the geek squad at the drop of a hat.  You were still willing to help them but they didn't appreciate you setting up boundaries.  It is understandable that you are annoyed by their behavior.", "NTA. They have such a sense of entitlement, don't they? Expecting you to provide free labor on demand, and throwing a massive tantrum when you don't. Is moving in with your ex-step father a feasible option? I suggest you seriously consider it.\n\n(And if you do move out and are no longer dependent on them for shelter, then you could consider charging for providing tech support.)", "NTA. IT guy here. I don't do support for friends or family. At all. If they insist, I tell them it's $250 an hour, two hour minimum including travel time. That's the family rate.\n\nShockingly enough, no one takes me up on it.", "NTA. You have a life and a job of your own. Helping occasionally is a fine expectation for them to have, as it is normal to help people you have a close relationship with. But for them to expect you to help ANY time anything goes wrong, especially a forgotten password, is insane. They have access to the internet. They have google. Resetting a password isn't even hard; most websites literally walk you through it step-by-step. The adults are being lazy and choosing not to read. You've even helped set up a password manager for them that they choose not to use.\n\nThe children especially should be learning this stuff, since this is something they're growing up with. If I was able to reset my webkinz password at 9 years old, they can reset their google password. Hell, I was doing netsh wlan in cmd to find my friends' wifi passwords at 9 years old.

You've given them every opportunity to figure things out, and make a system that works for everyone.\n\nFrom my perspective, they're treating you like a free service, not a family member. They're being selfish, expecting you to drop what you're doing the second anyone has a problem. They don't even have the slightest hint of respect for you if they're interrupting when you're studying.

We would wear masks, but nope.  My way of thinking is if they can go into the store to buy the stupid phone, they can come here to set it up. But they wouldn't. 3 weeks ago, they called again, wanting my husband to walk them thru cleaning up and setting up their laptop with a factory reset because it was running slow. 12 hours later, he was still on the phone with them because again... they wouldn't let him go there or them come here. We had plans that day, and he kept telling us 10 more minutes. The kids and I finally left and went to do our thing.

Granted, those 2 cases above were the extreme ones, but they call once or twice a week with \"little\" things (Amazon won't load, forgot my password, do I need to update all the apps on my phone if I don't use them at all) and it drives me crazy. \n\nNTA", "Omg - OP someone needs to give THEM and intervention.\n\nTech problems take a bit of time to solve and now multiply it by like 5 family members daily and you can easily lose hours every day. \n\n90% of these tech problems you describe are just lazy problems to solve, such as resetting a password etc and especially for the kids who are more tech literate. \n\nMy brother is better at tech than the rest of my family, he doesn\u2019t help unless we first have made a serious attempt at first finding a solution on our own. \n\nHaving the same problem over and over wouldn\u2019t be an excuse as you\u2019re expected to learn at some point. \n\nFor the most common problems. Make a step by step guide how to solve them. Put it in the cloud and also print one or two versions and leave in the house. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t exist, what would they do? They are acting extremely entitled to your time and they all need to start to become more independent. \n\nLive your life OP, focus at your studies and work. After X number of hours of unsolved problems they will all have more incentive to try to find a solution without you. \n\nGood luck.", "I honestly wonder what the adults do for a living. Like, even working at McDonald's requires more tech literacy than that these days.", "Mmmmm, where can I get a pink over sized hoodie with the same text?", "I have a scholarship.", "Thus is an excellent idea, Wish I had thought of it. The last time I did family support was when my mom called me from another state at 2 o'clock in the morning because her and her friend were drinking and decided to install a mouse and were having problems. I said you know what you should probably look into Geek Squad. I talk to you later hang up phone rolled over and went back to sleep. Lol Nobody got mad at me, but they know how I am. Mom's had geek squad ever since. She will bring her PC when she comes to visit and I'll do some maintenance and stuff. Like that on it for her but that's it.", "Next start a knowledge base.\nI also like the idea of monthly reporting. \"Auntie G got locked out of her eHarmony account 6 times last month.\"", "You should have a monthly meeting with the family with an analysis of the tickets.  \n\nPareto analysis because I'm willing to bet you a cookie that '80% of the problems can be traced back to 20% of the causes'.", "https://youtu.be/52DZ3x_TGUk", "Nta.\n\nThey say you're being disrespectful, but how are they being respectful of you, your time, or your expertise?\n\nGlad you have you ex-stepfather in your corner at least.\n\n\nAlso, your plan is genius.", "I think this is brilliant as well. I have three degrees in CS and some of my family still see me at someone that works at the geek squad (and nothing wrong to work at the geek squad but it is not what I do). I just simply don\u2019t help them. \n\nMy \u201cfriends\u201d used to ask me for help too. One person wanted me to help with the computer and I said sure. However, I needed the computers to come my house and he would get charge 150 an hour. He was mad and never talked to me again. Yet, he had plenty of money. \n\nI just don\u2019t help  people. I will ignore family request unless they are from my mom and i still punt them. I dont have time. \n\nBut what you did is out of this world!!! I want to be like you when I grow up!", "I'll give you the same advice as I just wrote for the OP.\n\nIT support for family and friends is a HARD NO for exactly the type of shyte your husband is going through and by the sounds of it is ruining your family time.  Your husband needs to tell them to go to Geek Squad.  He needs to tell them that his time is worth $200hr and can they afford that.", "I mean, tbh most people who think women are required to go out of their way to look \u201cfeminine\u201d also aren\u2019t big on those same women having opinions on things beyond their hair, so it could very easily be both.", "If you ever want to wear a skirt or dress, just wear shorts underneath.  Workout shorts\n/ compression shorts / booty shorts work great under skirts.   I wish I'd had that option 20 years ago when i was having to crawl around under desks to hook up Ethernet cables and the jackasses were trying to look up my skirt - which was required by dress code. Grrr.\n\nAnyway, you never have to wear a skirt if you don't want to.  But don't let fear of lifted skirts stop you from trying them out if you ever feel like it.  Just add some shorts.  In most places you'll likely find you'd be okay without the shorts once you get used to it.\n\n[Princess Awesome](https://princess-awesome.com/collections/adults) has comfortable dresses with prints like math symbols, dragons, etc, if you ever feel like having fun and outraging your mom at the same time. \n\nKeep your great boundaries in place - they'll serve you well in this career path.", "He bought it from ThinkGeek (RIP), but you can probably get one made.", "Yep. Write them an email that the fees are increasing. Make the IT support a monthly subscription model.", "that's where I thought the story was going", "A family dashboard and a knowledge base of self-help articles! Love it.", "I like the way you think", "It is so much a thing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always done to say, hurt you. It\u2019s more that they quickly learn that by feigning ignorance you will fix it for them. \n\nIt\u2019s become a well discussed issue in relationships, I even ended up sitting down with my spouse about it. I got sick of hearing \u201cbut you do the laundry so much better/ I don\u2019t know the settings/bs bs bs\u201d. Basically pawning off anything someone doesn\u2019t want to do by saying they don\u2019t know how or yo do it better. It\u2019s annoying as hell. \n\nAnd the fact that the kids refer to you as TS AND they staged a damn \u2018intervention\u2019 when you stood up for yourself\u2026. Holy hell. I am so sorry they try to manipulate you like that. And now they are stonewalling you to get you to do what they want. That\u2019s why you\u2019re getting cold shoulder. Are you usually a people pleaser? I feel like they don\u2019t like that you\u2019re standing up for yourself and you definitely need to get away from that."]}
