They need to calm down and learn patience.", "NTA - replace tickets with invoices for your time... They'll beg for the tickets back!", "NTA.  It is very inconsiderate of them to think that you are going to be the geek squad at the drop of a hat.  You were still willing to help them but they didn't appreciate you setting up boundaries.  It is understandable that you are annoyed by their behavior.", "NTA. They have such a sense of entitlement, don't they? Expecting you to provide free labor on demand, and throwing a massive tantrum when you don't. Is moving in with your ex-step father a feasible option? I suggest you seriously consider it.\n\n(And if you do move out and are no longer dependent on them for shelter, then you could consider charging for providing tech support.)", "NTA. IT guy here. I don't do support for friends or family. At all. If they insist, I tell them it's $250 an hour, two hour minimum including travel time. That's the family rate.\n\nShockingly enough, no one takes me up on it.", "NTA. You have a life and a job of your own. Helping occasionally is a fine expectation for them to have, as it is normal to help people you have a close relationship with. But for them to expect you to help ANY time anything goes wrong, especially a forgotten password, is insane. They have access to the internet. They have google. Resetting a password isn't even hard; most websites literally walk you through it step-by-step. The adults are being lazy and choosing not to read. You've even helped set up a password manager for them that they choose not to use.\n\nThe children especially should be learning this stuff, since this is something they're growing up with. If I was able to reset my webkinz password at 9 years old, they can reset their google password. Hell, I was doing netsh wlan in cmd to find my friends' wifi passwords at 9 years old.

You've given them every opportunity to figure things out, and make a system that works for everyone.\n\nFrom my perspective, they're treating you like a free service, not a family member. They're being selfish, expecting you to drop what you're doing the second anyone has a problem. They don't even have the slightest hint of respect for you if they're interrupting when you're studying.

I told him to tell them they have 2 choices, he can drive the 18 min to their house or they can come here. But no, they can't because of covid. No one was sick or exposed. We would wear masks, but nope.  My way of thinking is if they can go into the store to buy the stupid phone, they can come here to set it up. But they wouldn't. 3 weeks ago, they called again, wanting my husband to walk them thru cleaning up and setting up their laptop with a factory reset because it was running slow. 12 hours later, he was still on the phone with them because again... they wouldn't let him go there or them come here.
