And my family is B.I.G. I live with my mom, my little brother, 2 of my aunts and their kids. The kids are lazy when it comes to tech shit because they know I'll do it for them, but my mom and aunts are beyond tech illiterate, they're tech morons.\n\nI am constantly interrupted in my studies or word because my cousins forgot their Disney Plus profile pin, or my mom needs to reset her email password again, I actually set up a cloud password manager for them that they do not use because they always forget that it is an option. \n\nSo a few weeks ago, one of my little cousins wanted me to help him reset a password after he got locked out of Google, and he aggressively knocked on my door demanding that I help him.  I asked him, \"Do I look like TS to you?\" and he said yes with a straight face.\n\nSo I got a domain and set up a help desk. Then I told my family that if they wanted any help from me, they should go to the website and submit a ticket for my help. My aunt said I was being ridiculous, but I was deadly serious.\n\nIn the following days, I would give them the cold shoulder if they tried to come to me with technical problems, and just tell them to submit a ticket and I would send them the solution by mail. Forgot your mail password? Too bad, use someone else's mail. Fortnite is lagging? Get a ticket and wait till I'm home. That helped me a lot.\n\nBut then yesterday I came back from the university and the whole house was sitting in the living room telling me to sit down. They were doing an INTERVENTION on me! WTF!? They said I was rude, cold, condescending, and unhelpful. My mom said she's tolerated my \"manly ways\" (no idea where that comes from) because I'm helpful with technology, but now they won't stand up to my disrespect and I'm treating them like children. I said no, I'm treating them like customers.\n\nThe discussion got heated and turned into a screaming match. I said I would move in with my ex-stepfather because he doesn't ask me to do shit, I'm still with my family but I feel like everyone hates me now, but my ex step father says I'm on my right to be annoyed by them.

Not only NTA, but genius.", "NTA    No good deed goes unpunished.\n\nI'm sympathetic with folks who are technologically illiterate if they're willing to listen and at least try.  Less so with those who are lazy entitled jerks.  You're facing a mixture of both, compounded by the numbers.\n\nYour solution was ingenious - good show.  I'm hoping you don't actually have to move, and that the threat gets them to shape up.\n\n(Edit: typo)", "NTA.  You help desk still got them help and allowed you to help them on your own time and when it was convenient to you.  They seem to not value your time or effort.  They need to calm down and learn patience.", "NTA - replace tickets with invoices for your time... They'll beg for the tickets back!", "NTA.  It is very inconsiderate of them to think that you are going to be the geek squad at the drop of a hat.  You were still willing to help them but they didn't appreciate you setting up boundaries.  It is understandable that you are annoyed by their behavior.", "NTA. They have such a sense of entitlement, don't they? Expecting you to provide free labor on demand, and throwing a massive tantrum when you don't. Is moving in with your ex-step father a feasible option? I suggest you seriously consider it.\n\n(And if you do move out and are no longer dependent on them for shelter, then you could consider charging for providing tech support.)", "NTA. IT guy here. I don't do support for friends or family. At all. If they insist, I tell them it's $250 an hour, two hour minimum including travel time. That's the family rate.\n\nShockingly enough, no one takes me up on it.", "NTA. You have a life and a job of your own. Helping occasionally is a fine expectation for them to have, as it is normal to help people you have a close relationship with. But for them to expect you to help ANY time anything goes wrong, especially a forgotten password, is insane. They have access to the internet. They have google. Resetting a password isn't even hard; most websites literally walk you through it step-by-step. The adults are being lazy and choosing not to read. You've even helped set up a password manager for them that they choose not to use.\n\nThe children especially should be learning this stuff, since this is something they're growing up with. If I was able to reset my webkinz password at 9 years old, they can reset their google password. Hell, I was doing netsh wlan in cmd to find my friends' wifi passwords at 9 years old. If the kids are old enough to play fortnite, they're old enough to learn basic computer literacy.", "NTA. They don't have the right to constantly interrupt you. You can get to their tech issues when you get to them. Btw, I hope you're charging $ for your services.\n\nYou may lose the ability to live there over this, but they may also decide that your help is worth it and decide to be more polite about requesting your help.", "NTA.\n\nAnd they are the ones who are disrespectful, treating you like an TS - and never get their shit together and LEARN!", "NTA and I suspect you're going to go far in your career before too much longer!\n\nYour family are behaving like spoiled, entitled, obnoxious AHs and your mother's whole thing about \"manly\" just means she hates the fact that you aren't being a submissive doormat and kowtowing to their every demand as if you were nothing more than an unpaid servant.  I seriously hope that you are able to make a change in residence and it's probably time to block phones and media access and let them figure out how to deal with the modern world on their own.  A few weeks of that might (but it's a really weak might!) make them appreciate you and treat you and what you do for them with more respect.", "EPIC idea!!!!\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. They're bad clients. Fire them.", "NTA. Some of their quotations could easily be answered online, they\u2019re just being lazy. I\u2019m not the best with computers but if I can\u2019t find the answer online, I ask a teenage family member for help, and I freaking pay them for their time. (They love helping me now)", "Clear NTA. Move out and be done with the useless ungrateful inconsiderate lot of them.", "NTA. Remind them that you are not their tech support but a family member. It is your right to tell them no when you don't have time. If they wish to press the matter, tell them you'll charge them for your time and don't help them.\n\nI have friends who ask me for help and they have no problems paying for my time. That payment can be anything from actual cash to food, but they do pay for my time.", "NTA. The only way I would help them is to print out directions and tell them to figure it out. They will never retain it.", "NTA.  You're a genius, but also the fact that it's come to this means they are relying on you WAY TOO MUCH already.  Don't let them weaponize incompetence.  They are capable of figuring this stuff out too.  It doesn't take a CS degree to reset an email!", "NTA this is brilliant", "NTA.\n\nFrom the limited info, ex-step-dad sounds like a better person to live with. If I had a situation like this that escalated to having to move out, I'd never help them with these things again. Not even advice on how to figure it out themselves or find someone else to help. You've given them every opportunity to figure things out, and make a system that works for everyone.\n\nFrom my perspective, they're treating you like a free service, not a family member. They're being selfish, expecting you to drop what you're doing the second anyone has a problem. They don't even have the slightest hint of respect for you if they're interrupting when you're studying. Yet, they expect you to do everything for them, as soon as they want it, just because they don't want to utilize the solutions you've already freely given to them.", "NTA - As a data architect, I appreciate what you've done. I went through the same crap when I was in college like 15 years ago. I told everybody the only solution I'm offering going forward was Linux installed on everything. Suddenly everybody started trying to solve their own problems and stopped going to shady sites", "NTA. They are not my family, never even met them, but I'm annoyed by them and would even help you pack up your stuff to move out. \n\nGenius idea about the online ticket, btw. They think that system is rude and condescending? Wait until they have to figure it out themselves or else pay someone to do it. I think your system will look wonderful by comparison, but that's too bad as you will have already moved out.\n\nBest of luck with school!", "NTA. God-Tier move. Well done.", ">I said no, I'm treating them like customers.\n\nNot if they're not paying you. Now each ticket is $50. NTA", "Y(N)TA only because you thought of this amazing idea and I didn\u2019t.
