{"id": 851, "submission_id": "yjht31", "title": "AITA for not wanting to contribute to a down payment for my parents?", "selftext": "My parents bought a house 20+ years ago. They paid it off 7 years ago. At the time, I was in undergrad, living at home (commuter school), and doing an internship... so I had enough disposable income on hand. When the opportunity came up for my parents to be able to pay off their mortgage faster with lumpsum payments, I offered several thousand to help them out. I have never asked for that money back and don't plan to.\n\nAt present, I am working full-time. But due to high cost of living, I am still living at home to continue saving. I'm able to save 70% of my income by living at home, and not spending excessively. Even though I have a decent salary and have saved $100k so far, I am not able to afford buying my own place because real estate is out of control in the city I work in. If I rent, I would be foregoing any chances of ever saving enough to buy my own place.\n\nRecently my parents brought up the idea of upgrading the house. They want a bigger place, which I somewhat understand since we are a bit cramped here. It's not totally bad, but with the way the real estate market is here and the rate of inflation, I don't think it's the best idea. My parents have asked me to contribute to the down payment, and when I asked whose name would be on the deed of a new house, they blew up on me and accused me of not being \"family oriented\" and implied I was selfish. I got angry about this, and the fact that I paid for the new family car and it feels unfair to ask this on top of that when my dad doesn't even bother to work full-time (even though he's only in his 50s)... well at that point my dad erupted with self-righteous anger and said \"I never asked you pay for the car or the lumpsum payment before, that was your choice, don't get angry at me for that now.\"\n\nI am grateful of everything they have done. But I have spent years saving and living with \"delayed gratification\" so that I can someday afford my own place. So I am deeply uncomfortable contributing to their down payment because that would put me behind on my own financial/ life goals.\n\nAITA for not wanting to contribute to their down payment?\n\nTLDR: I live with my parents (rent-free). They want to upgrade to a bigger house house and are asking me for help with the down payment. I already bought them the family car when the old one went to shit, and helped them pay off their current mortgage with a several thousand dollars that I have never asked back for. Them asking me to contribute to a new down payment for a bigger house is putting me in a really uncomfortable situation where I am guilt tripped by them. What do I do?\n\nEDIT: I'm 28 years old, for context.\n\nEDIT: More context -  The lumpsum I gave to pay off the mortgage on the current house was $16k. The car cost approx. $29k. They haven't asked a specific amount for the down payment, but given what I know about the current housing market here, I expect they would hope for around $30-40k from me.

To me that seems like a much more sensible solution, but obviously your parents aren't obligated to do that.

Some companies are super strict on where this money comes from.

How long do they expect you to remain living with them?\n\nMaybe it is time to move to an apartment or something to get out of your parents home.

And you have already given them $45k, which is a very large sum of money.

I think you should really focus on trying to move out.", "NTA.  I am missing 1 little detail here.  If the house is paid off, selling the house will give a down-payment on the new house, no? \n\nEither way, they are clearly making a decision to live above their means.

This may just be a failure to communicate but your \u2018delayed gratification\u2019 is looking a lot like refusing to leave the nest to me.  The parents are only AHs because they are being so negative in how they approached you with this.

Maybe you should looking at  renting a room and move out.\n\nYou've been helpful enough paying off the mortgage and buying a new car.  I think given the help that they either know or suspect that you have money to 'spare'.\n\nI would get out of Dodge as soon as possible.\n\nMost folk would be excited just to have to pay the property taxes and utilities and not subject themselves to a higher monthly payment.  Something is up considering that they won't put you on the lease.", "Sorry, that\u2019s a tough situation. I wish I had better suggestions for you. I hope it gets better for you.", "You were kind. Yes, at 19 you are an adult and you live with them rent free now. Used, or not, you bought a car when they needed one.  \n\nAdd up what you have spent. That's not my idea of rent free. Your parents are wrong for throwing \"rent free\" in your face if they do. They are wrong for telling you that you don't prioritize your family. Your actions say otherwise.\n\nYour living space may be tight, but you said it is serviceable. The house is paid for. I assume that you have a timeline (mental, verbal or written) to leave. Why would you invest further in real estate with your parents? \n\nYour question about the names that will be listed on the title was reasonable. Their reaction was not. That also means your opinions don't matter. They are interested in choosing a house that suits them.\n\nWhy would you invest further funds of your money?", "Totally agree. If the parents complained would suggest nominal rent as the mortgage is paid off\u2026.to help with taxes, water, electric, etc.  If she wants to save more and $100k isn\u2019t enough to get a house alone and the parents keep pushing it  small amount monthly may be a compromise.", "Consider paying rent, make it fair (1 bedroom rent with utilities) and pay that to your parents. \nSave the rest including anymore money that you might consider gifting them for your own future. \nTell them this figure and that\u2019s how you will contribute to their finances, but not a lump sum. \nThey might actually appreciate it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "IF you buy a house, you would be responsible for the mortgage anyway. This way, with mortgage and a history of payments, you're more likely to get a loan for a house...having credit to get credit. \n\nAnd if you're on the mortgage, they wouldn't have to pay you back as your equity would be the house if they sell it or you inherit the house when they pass...", "Have you considering relocating? Like what\u2019s the point in staying here if you\u2019re not able to save enough to enter the market?", "Have they just kind of come to the conclusion you\u2019re going to continue living with them indefinitely though until they die or you start a family of your own? That might be part of it. I get how crazy the housing market is right now and also live in a HCoL east coast city but at this point maybe they just kind of see you staying for long enough that the down payment would kind of be your contribution / this is the house you\u2019re buying that you\u2019re saving for you know?\n\nBut they\u2019re also asking to borrow the money not asking you to gift it it sounds like ? So even if I\u2019m wrong about the above if you think they\u2019d pay you back within 2-5 years, they\u2019re looking to get a cheaper mortgage and assume you won\u2019t be able to afford a new place in that time frame even without lending them the money - I can kind of see why from their perspective they\u2019re expecting it. You also mention later that you wish you hadn\u2019t set a bad precedent by giving they money at 19/20\u2026you\u2019ve paid $375 a month to cover all your living expenses since you were 18. Not just rent but also utilities, groceries, and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re probably not paying for your own wifi or anything separately? Putting that into perspective- the down payments you mention friends parents helping them afford to buy condos and stuff ? Well you opted for assistance through a different method because they\u2019ve been continually supporting you even with  those two gifts you gave. Also you basically implying they\u2019re lazy and entitled because of all this and the fact that your 50ish dad isn\u2019t working full time (when he has about double the amount of wear and tear on his body and mind that you do ) makes it clear you have taken them for granted and assume that it\u2019s their duty to support you - if not this way but through having given you a down payment earlier to get your own place. You say you know they don\u2019t have an obligation sure but everything else you\u2019re saying and feeling says otherwise.", "I am on the  East coast in a HCOL city, it's very expensive. Every millennial I know my age who bought a condo or house got financial help from their parents.", "Yep I should have clarified that but thanks for doing it for me.", "Yeah, and I don't know why they need an upgrade house when OP is saving to move out... Like, soon they will have more space once the housing market tanks and OP can afford/find a house to move out. Unless they want OP to forever live with them.", "To be fair, I'd be furious if they were charging OP rent after he paid $45k to help pay off the mortgage and buy the car. That 100% cancelled out rent and still has thousands of dollars still in OP's corner.", "Thank you!", "No, if he\u2019s on the parents\u2019 mortgage then trying to buy his own house would be a second home. Would make getting a mortgage harder. And being responsible for a mortgage you budgeted for is very different than risking being responsible for his parents\u2019 mortgage which will likely have a higher payment since they want a McMansion.", "Because my job is refusing to make me a permanently remote employee. I am currently searching for remote jobs because that would be ideal. If I need to move further away to be able to afford it, I am willing to do that. But at present, the constraint of where my job is located is making the situation more difficult. I am already 1-1.5 hours away from my office. Idk how much further I can move away before I end wasting half my day in commute.", "This is exactly what I was about to write! If they want him to live with them it may mean they are expecting him to be their retirement fund or care taker. If my house was paid off and my kid was close to buying their own place I wouldn't be trying to buy a bigger place."]}
