What happened happened. That said I think you may be walking a fine line between honesty and trauma dumping.

Depression sucks, I was so far in a few years ago, I had to take medication to function, and counseling.  I have worked my way up enough to be able to function and I do find things I actually enjoy sometimes.  \n\nI am so sorry you lost your father; I lost my father and I miss him every day, it's been 25 years.   I do things now and think of if he would be proud of me or not, and it does help.  I have also lost my oldest son, and I cope the same way, I think if what I am doing would make him proud of me.   \n\nDepression is hard, and very real, I ask your age OP because I was just wondering if you are an adult who can seek treatment and get away from your mother.", "NTA - Anything that can be destroyed by telling the truth deserves to be destroyed.", "NTA", "NTA, but you seem to think you\u2019re stuck in this state forever, which you aren\u2019t.

Full stop. \n\nHow do you know they\u2019re worthy? Go slow to build trust. If that doesn\u2019t make sense then learn a bit about trust and attachment in relationships. There\u2019s tons of podcasts out there that are excellent starting places. \n\nI used to vomit my trauma stories to potential new friends and love interests thinking that if they accepted me and my crazy past then I was lovable. I was wrong. \n\nYou, the true and authentic you\u2026.are lovable and worthy of love. From friends, parent-like figures, and romantic interests. \n\nBe safe \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA - if she doesn\u2019t want her reputation ruined she should not have behaved the way she did."]}
