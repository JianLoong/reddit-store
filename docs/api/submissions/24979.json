At 32 I felt the same as I did at 25 though - if they\u2019d met at those ages it wouldn\u2019t raise flags really for me. But definitely a 21 and 28 year old getting together is very different places. Sounds like the girlfriend has moved on - maybe because OP is older now?

Are you someone she loves and trusts enough to say that she\u2019d rather attend this cool event alone so she can party with her coworkers, rather than entertain you when you don\u2019t know anyone? Are you the person she\u2019s eager to introduce to her coworkers because you\u2019re important to her? Are you a central part of her life, enough that she\u2019s interested in making a deal where she gets to do this solo and you\u2019ll either get to do something amazing with your friends or take a cool trip with her later? \n\nAll of those are possible good/acceptable answers, they might not work for everyone, but they\u2019re reasonable compromises/outcomes that two people in a caring and committed relationship could arrive at. \n\nWhat\u2019s worrisome to me is how much not a part of her life, plan, priorities you appear to be. If you\u2019re not in a mutual, respectful, caring relationship with someone who treats you and your well being as a priority, then who she\u2019s sleeping with (or not) is the least of your problems. \n\n(Just to be clear, I\u2019m not excusing potential cheating, and I\u2019d agree it sounds like a solid possibility here.
