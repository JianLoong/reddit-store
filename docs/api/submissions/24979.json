See what chaos happens", "It would be very strange for someone to invite an adult to a wedding without a plus one, especially if that person is in a relationship and espcially if it's a destination wedding. Since I've been an adult, I have always been allowed a plus one at weddings. \n\nThis is Fishy op. NTA", "The 4 year age gap in this relationship seems surprisingly obvious. Gf seems to be the one in control, easily keeping the younger partner on his back foot with self-doubt. Sounds like manipulation is a common occurrence, which is so sad. OP doesn\u2019t want to lose what he feels may be the best thing to happen to him, when it\u2019s really him being unaware that gf is always thinking three steps ahead of him. Don\u2019t settle for disrespect just because she makes being in a relationship with her a no-brainer for you. You can have those things with someone who also respects you.", "Not to say that she is cheating but lied about the invite. You need to know why and should know. You came across this by accident. When you're caught in a lie its normal to try to deflect.", "You\u2019re her boytoy.\n\nShe\u2019s ashamed, and won\u2019t want people to say she\u2019s robbing the cradle.\n\n\u2014", "Nta. Your imagination hasn't run anywhere. You're making observations and noticing an obvious correlation.", "NTA\n\nLet her go and change the locks before she gets back.

Sorry man.", "INFO \n\nDID you mention the possibility of unfaithfulness when you confronted her?", "NTA. She's acting sus, she did lie and she immediately jumped to thinking you were accusing her of cheating when you were accusing her of lying about the invitation.\n\nShow up at the airport and see who she's flying out with. Well, or do the boring adult thing and sit her down and say you need to talk, that she's taking secret calls, acting cold, plainly lied about being invited for the wedding and that if she can't tell the truth the relationship is over, if she tells the truth it might not be.\n\nBut like, who doesn't like the caught cheating partner in the act moments in stories.", "NTA..  when she gets back have her bags packed .. it's over..   may as well be on your terms..", ">I let my imagination get the best of me and I'm worried I permanently fucked up the level of trust in our relationship.\n\nI let my imagination get the best of me and I'm worried **Melody** permanently fucked up the level of trust in our relationship.\n\nFTFY\n\nNTA,", "NTA. The phone call was the guy she wants to go with her. Literally no reason for her to lie about the invitation and if there was she would have explained when you found it. She is cheating.", "NTA.\n\nThis needs to be talked about and she needs to honest and give valid reasons as why she choose to do that. \n\nAlso do you know anyone else at the wedding...like to know if she took another plus 1", "I don't think it's great that you went snooping but that being said, you felt the need to do so in this instance so trusted your gut and hey...she's found wanting!\n\nShe did lie and she's also tried shifting focus so to me the logical conclusion is...\nYour lady is/has been playing away. It may be a friends with benefits from before she sees occasionally but I think it would be someone she knows from before regardless. Who is irrelevant. NTA", "NTA. She did lie. She\u2019s also exhibiting textbook cheater behavior. It might be an emotional affair that\u2019s about to become physical at the wedding or it might already be physical. It\u2019s time for her to do some serious explaining (before she leaves) and for you to make a decision whether you want to be there when she gets back.", "NTA. I suggest you get away from this woman.", "I say this with kindness - I can't think of any innocent explanation for her overall behaviour. If my spouse got a call on his phone from a strange number and LEFT THE ROOM to take it, you can bet he would explain him self on his return. So would I if it happened to me. That's what people who're not lying and sneaking around do. You're NTA and her aggressive denials of something you didn't actually accuse her of unfortunately speak volumes. You could try and talk to her calmly before she goes and demand an explanation, but if I were you I'd be planning to be finding another living situation very soon.", "She is cheating.", "NTA, she is fuckin her boss", "NTA. Stop lying to yourself, you've been intentionally lied to and emotionally beaten. She's cheating. Your relationship is over.", "Soft ESH you two aren\u2019t going to last long", "Definitely NOT the asshole. As soon as she accused you of snooping, she admitted she had something to hide. Honestly, it's up to you, but that's a trust breaker for me. I'd probably leave her.", " Yeah, she fuckin\u2019", "NTA, and your first instinct is right. She is taking a +1 to the wedding but it\u2019s not you. Whispered conversations and then acting cold toward you really tells you all you need to know. I have never been so sorry for telling someone they\u2019re right.", "Dude, move her stuff out while she's gone.   Coz she already is.   Sorry.  \ud83d\ude44", "NTA - she ruined the trust in the marriage. She lied and you deserve to know why before making a decision on whether to forgive.

It's not like she told him 'you accuse me of lying' or something, no. It's not like 'as I said my coworkers don't know you, so I said you're not invited altogether, to avoid hurting you' or something to that extent. No, her immediate response was 'cheating'. Dude, RUN.", "OP listen to this\u261d\ufe0f.

OP, you gotta run!", "Exactly. If my wife was invited to a destination wedding and I wasn't, I'd still travel with her. We'd go a day or two early and leave a day later to have a vacation outside of the one day she's attending the wedding.", "But the issue about her being embarrassed by the age gap is, when you introduce your partner (or anyone for that matter), you don't say 'here's my partner Connor, he's 25', you'd say 'that's Connor, my partner' and that's it. And people don't usually question age, where you're from, etc.", "You act like it\u2019s that easy to leave someone and get a place all on your own with the crazy prices of housing.", "Do you get how much money it actually cost to \u201cchange the locks\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s not cheap.", "Waste of money. Spend it on a rental bond when he moves out", "That\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard", "Unfortunately, this is really the only logical conclusion.   \n\n\nThere is no reason for her to get defensive when you confront her with genuine evidence that she lied straight to your face, and to understandably ask why.  \n\n\nShe then immediatly went to \"are you accusing me of cheating, you're the bad guy here, why don't you trust me!?\"  \n\n\n...because you just found evidence that shows you shouldn't have trusted her. Because she lied.  \n\n\nIm sorry man, but if i was you, i'd be finding a place to stay so that you're gone the day she returns.", "I agree. Probably bang on.", "How about c) she\u2019s embarrassed by the age gap and doesn\u2019t want to introduce her much younger boyfriend to her coworkers. Especially since they\u2019ve been together for 4 years.", "The other option is she\u2019s already cheating with a coworker", " She's acting sues, she did lie and she immediately jumped to thinking he were accusing her of cheating when you were accusing her of lying about the invitation.", "I wasn\u2019t thinking money.

She\u2019s absolutely cheating.", "I think you got your answer anyway.\n\nShe's made a choice, and it isn't you.", "After being together 4 years it's a little strange to me that you haven't met her coworkers, especially if she is close enough to any of them to be invited to the wedding. \n\n\nThe behaviour is definitely suspicious, you need to try and talk to her calmly, see if you can get to the truth.\n\n\nAlso I think it's worth having a look at her social media for photos of the wedding, including any that she's tagged in, you might see something that gives you a clue. Is she in alot of comfy pics with one person in particular", "INFO: We know you didn\u2019t directly ask her if she was cheating, but u/jnf919\u2019s question was if you implied that she was cheating, so you didn\u2019t really answer the question. \n\nSo\u2026\n\n> Did you imply she was cheating on you when you asked about the wedding, or did you simply ask why she lied about having a plus one?\n\nCould you also describe your tone of voice, volume, and demeanor?\n\nWe get that it\u2019s on your mind, so I explore whether you may be projecting first which could mean she\u2019s not cheating and you\u2019re in your head.", "I think they meant Natasha!!!!!

I don\u2019t think couples with age gaps are suspicious.  I knew people with age gaps.  The wife was 13 years older than her husband.
