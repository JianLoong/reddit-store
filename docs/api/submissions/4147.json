They were calling you a racial slur ! (Although it was incorrect) and you were telling them it would be the same as calling them their racial slur! \n\nWhy are they mad? That was what they did to you\n\nWhere are the teachers when all of this goes on and why are t they stopping it?", "NTA.\n\nCalling you a \"chink\" IS the same as you calling them a \"paki\" -- because it is both misdirected (the wrong culture) *and* derogatory and offensive. In that sense what you said was \\*exactly the same\\* as what your friend said except that you were trying to make an actual point and it doesn't sound like he was.\n\nA side note: the kids in your school aren't doing this more because of what you said. You did not bring the heightened bullying on yourself. They're doing it because they want to be doing it and will seize anything that even appears to be a potential excuse, but rest assured they would still being doing whether you said anything or not.\n\nI'm really sorry kids are such enormous jerks.", "NTA and you're being bullied. They're the racist AHs, they're trying to shift this onto you when you were (rightly) trying to stand up for yourself. I know it might be risky depending on where you live, but please try to confide in a trusted adult and get help from a teacher or something- you don't deserve to have to be in that kind of environment when you're trying to learn.", "NTA. I'm so sorry to hear that you're going to school with a bunch of cruel racist jerks and I really hope you'll follow the other commenters advice in telling you to confide in staff members or a trusted adult because you shouldn't be subjected to this. As for what you said you've already admitted it was a mistake and you were only trying to point out the ignorance of the things that you were called. The backlash you are receiving is inappropriate and you don't deserve to be treated this way. I'm sorry you're going through this and try your best to keep your head up and know that they are wrong for treating you this way.", "NTA.  You have some strange classmates who are unfortunately have bad parents.", "NTA\n\n>other classmates defending this kid and saying I was a racist asshole.\n\nSo let me get this straight.  A racist AH called you something disgusting, you *inadvertently* called them something disgusting back, and now people are calling YOU a racist AH?\n\nI mean, at the very least, why wouldn\u2019t they call both of you racist?\n\nNever mind.  I know why.  Because the people calling you a \u201cracist\u201d are racist themselves.  And by the way, don\u2019t torture yourself into thinking you somehow \u201ccaused\u201d this by what you said.  That\u2019s not how racism works.  If it wasn\u2019t this, it would be something else.  Racists are racist because they\u2019re RACIST.  Not because their victims did anything \u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nWhere are your teachers?  This is insane.  Where is the principal?  Have you told your parents?  You are being racially targeted at school, and that is NOT ok.\n\nBy the way, my parents came from Pakistan.  If you called me that, I\u2019d be furious.  Until I saw your face and you apologized and I realized you had no idea what it was that you said.\n\nAnd then we\u2019d be perfectly fine.  You know why?  Because I\u2019m not a freaking RACIST.", "No, I don't think you are at fault. When I was younger, I was messing around with my hands, and I had the realization that you could point with other fingers, not just the pointer finger. I tried it, and ended up pointing the middle finger at my teacher. The bullies then called my teacher over. Ignorance doesn't always excuse behavior, but it does for you. You had no way of knowing, because no one would have told you. NTA. I am sorry you have been racially bullied.", "NTA.

Chink is also not exactly a term of endearment, so no idea why the Indian classmate is getting so worked up about a taste of his own medicine.", "You didn't call them a slur, though.  You used it in a simile to illustrate your assertion that \"Chink\" is a racist slur (when directed at a person, people, or culture - there are other, entirely benign definitions and I'm kinda salty I feel i have to say that... *glares at kid brother*). \n\nYou did NOTHING wrong.", "Nta.

One slur often begets others sadly, especially from young people.", "NTA i dont see how your slur was worse than his. If he can dish it out he can take it.\n\nYou literally were bullied and verbally assaulted because of your race. He had it coming. Keep using the word on him every time he calls you a slur. Maybe eventually he will get it", "NTA you are straight up getting racism abuse. You really need to start recording all this and then report it to your teachers or to your parents. Don't stand for it. I always remember at school some of the Pakistani kids used to call some of my friends racial slurs but got away with it for months even in front of teachers yet the one time he lost his cool and just said shut it p*ki it was treated like he'd murdered a bunch of babies. \nNow I'm in my 30's and have worked with alot of Bangladeshi and Indians I was surprised at how many of the males I meet young and old that where extremely racist against Pakistani and Chinese people, Pakistani I was told it was because of the war when Pakistan declared independence and all the murders that radicals did in the borders of India, the Chinese I never got an answer. Try not to let it get you down whatever you do and be proud of your heritage. I mean I'm a white English male and have had friends from all over the world and have been asked by people I know why I talk to x, y or z people and just say why not I get to learn interesting things about there heratige and don't see why skin tone should effect me enjoying someone's company.", "NTA\nI an Indian, and I\u2019ve NEVER heard of Paki before, wtf does it mean?!\n\nAnyway, the bullies are now trying to play victim?

Me being a petty ass person, I would wright an essay on racism and copy dozens of them to throw them in their face whenever they mock your eyes and language.

I hope you are able to get some help from a counselor or something but bullying in school is a tough thing to erradicate. \nAlso, I had no idea in Britain the word Paki was a slur. As far as I know in the US it is just the way a lot of people from Pakistan use to refer about themselves (I used to work with several Pakistani people).
