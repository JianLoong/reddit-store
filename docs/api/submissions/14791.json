Today, I was frustrated to start with, because yesterday I had told him I wanted coffee and his response was \u201cCoffee?? Oh no I don\u2019t want my coffee yet\u201d I didn\u2019t want to deal with the conversation at the time, so I just got up and made my coffee and later told him I wanted him to make the coffee tomorrow(I know it seems silly to plan ahead who\u2019s making coffee but again, this is a long-standing conversation.

Why don\u2019t I deserve the same treatment you\u2019re getting? \u201cOh but you want your coffee earlier than me so that\u2019s why you always make them.\u201d Yes but you know that and I told you that I wanted you to make the coffee today, so what gives? What does you wanting or not wanting coffee rn have to do with weather or not you make me coffee.

There are plenty of small things my partner and I do for each other that may not seem like a big deal (one of which is making the coffee) but we do it because we love making the other happy.

It's not the small things, it's the build up of a bunch of small things that are showing they don't care. This isn't about the coffee. This is about the fact that you've communicated multiple times what you need and he doesn't care enough to do it. \n\nI'd also like to say, knowing your love languages is important so that you can show your person love in THEIR love language. If my husband's love language is physical touch and mine is acts and services, it's about how you receive love. You like to receive love in acts and services and he likes to receive love in touch. He needs to work on showing you love by your love language - acts and services!", "I have a feeling that coffee is the tip of the iceberg here... Do you feel unappreciated or that you are giving more in the relationship than they are? Deep down, we humans all want to be treated the same way we treat others. \n\nBut it's unrealistic to expect someone to love you the same way you love. Try looking for things that your partner does that they do (maybe automatically) that you appreciate they handle and you would be less than excited to do yourself, and see making coffee each morning for the both of you as how you can express to your partner how much they mean to you. \n\nGiving you a soft YTA\n\nEdit: updating to say I missed the part where he had agreed to do it a few times for you, I thought it was just you asking over and over despite him saying he didn't want to. That's a bit of a AH move on him to promise/agree then back out of it. NTA OP but make sure he understands this is more than coffee he's agreeing to and so the let down is much harder on you! Also the unrealistic part I'm referring to I will use my own relationship as an example. I'm a super romantic, do big gestures all the time type of gal. My husband is the complete opposite, as much as I would love a big romantic gesture for me, when he does something specifically to show me how much he loves me in his own way that's fine with me and it won't stop me from loving him in my way with the big gestures. Good luck!", "NTA. Clearly not about the coffee, you dummies! The issue is obviously that OP feels unappreciated. If the husband is asked to do something, confirms that he'll do it, then doesn't do it OVER AND OVER, it's clear that he's not pulling his weight, that he breaks his promises, and that he is not paying attention to what OP needs. He's probably doing this in lots of areas of the relationship.\n\nOP, you don't have a coffee problem; you have a husband problem.", "That sounds exhausting lol.

I guess the question should actually be \u201cAITA for expecting my partner to do something he said he\u2019d do\u201d because that\u2019s where the issue is, not the coffee.\n\nETA: over the relationship as a whole, finances are pretty equal, he tends to work longer hours, but intermittently because he\u2019s a contractor (e.g. he\u2019ll be working 10-12 hour days for two weeks and then be off for a week). I\u2019m the only one who cooks, we rarely eat out, and cleaning is about equal.", "ESH but the automatic coffee maker still means she does all the work.", "I actually never said anything about the coffee being difficult to make. Yes it\u2019s obviously bigger than the coffee. Reading back I realize I didn\u2019t state that when I first brought it up, he told me that was something he could do. He\u2019s told me that multiple times. If I had brought it up and he told me \u201cno I don\u2019t think I can manage that\u201d it would\u2019ve ended there, because coffee is such a little thing, but he\u2019s told me multiple times that he would do it. So when that doesn\u2019t happen over multiple conversations, I demanded clarity from him on what he was actually willing to do and it turned into a huge fight.", "Lol", "Keurig may have unintentionally saved a lot of marriages.", "8 years. I posted about this specific conflict because fighting about coffee makes me question my sanity. He consistently does this \u201cif you want something, just aassskk!\u201d Which is valid, but only to an extent. Like \u201cI would like you to make our coffee sometimes without me having to directly request it every single time\u201d is asking. He\u2019ll give me whatever I ask for in the moment, but if I ask something for the future, it evaporates. I want to be shown appreciation in the ways that I\u2019m asking for it. He consistently says yes, but then never does it. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re beyond repair at this point.", "I'm sorry people are failing to see the bigger picture here, it can be difficult sometimes when it comes to posts that only talk about one issue. I really hope that he can recognize how important it is to do the things that make you feel appreciated, that INCLUDES the little things, with relationships it should always include the little things. The way your partner makes you feel in the in between of your day to day is a major component in how you feel valued and cherished in the relationship. You deserve the little things! Best of luck.", "It\u2019s not about the coffee! I started writing more generally but then it sounded too vague but then I got too specific I guess and now everybody is like \u201cget a Keurig\u201d \ud83d\ude2d", "Do you wanna spend your life trying to get a grown man to make coffee or do you wanna move on. . Like idk, teaching men basic empathy and consideration isn't what I was planning for my life. This will not get better... Just put yourself first, whatever that means to you.", "How long have you been married? Marriage is not easy or simple. Obviously, it\u2019s not about the coffee... or the trash, or the laundry, or anything that both of you are capable of doing. It\u2019s consideration & communication.\n\nYou each have your own perspectives. If your husband isn\u2019t listening or hearing you I highly recommend you get a counselor to help. My husband & I did that around year 10. We had 4 kids (8,6,4,4) at that point & we needed help to be better partners & better parents. It really did help to be able to hear each other. It\u2019s not a magical fix. But it can help to get everyone back on the same path.\n\neta \u2014 we still have our challenges but we are better at recognizing rabbit shit vs bear shit. We deal with cleaning up the bear shit. The rabbit shit we just walk through. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. Wish you the best.", "I\u2019ll give you a helpful idea... up to you if you want to apply it. \n\nInstead of I would love you to do this for me.... \u201cit would really help our relationship if you followed through with the things you say you will do. If you think the requests I am talking about are unreasonable then let me know we can figure out a solution together. Don\u2019t say yes if you mean no because we both need to feel the expectations are reasonable & good about our relationship\u201d.\n\neta \u2014- or you can accept you picked the wrong man who is flawed & won\u2019t be any better. Totally valid was well.", "You're doing something for him that he's never asked you to do, and has even asked you not to do.", "But how much of a surprise is it if you asked him to do it? In your post, you actually went so far as to schedule it in advance. Point is, you want him to show \"spontaneous\" affection for you by doing exactly what you demand when you demand it, all without being asked.  Why not just accept the ways he chooses to express love for you instead? You'll both be happier.", "Yes this is exactly it. The only reason we\u2019re talking about coffee is because that\u2019s the specific thing I asked for in the context of this disagreement", "I agree.  I would expect that if the coffee gets solved by a system like this, something else will take its place.", "Will keep in mind, im a little new to this lol, thank you!", "He said he'd do it, but he didn't say when. He was just gonna make it later, right?\n\nJust tell him you want your coffee served to you *now* lol. I suppose he doesn't wanna do it when you want it bcz he's still groggy and lazy from waking up", "Well, you are in fact making a big deal out of something that really isn't a big deal.  This is not an issue to get stuck on.  Focus on things that matter more in the long run.", "The only thing getting a Keurig will do is make your coffee shitty, lmao", ">It\u2019s not about the coffee!\n\nIf it's not about the coffee, my advice is to communicate that it is not about the coffee. We all on reddit may be able to see that it's not about the coffee, but I don't think HE sees it. You can't fault him for not picking up on hints.\n\nPlease tell him it's not about the coffee, it's not about the Iranian yogurt, and you need something from him to feel special and then verbalize what that means. Some people just want these small gestures from their significant other and think hints should be all their partners needs to make the gesture. It may suck to you that you have to spell it out, but you can't expect him to just be keyed into what you're thinking. \n\nCommunicate with him, have an open and honest conversation about how you want to feel special and appreciated. Then, take a step back and give him a few months to figure out what that means for him. Hopefully, he's showing you that he loves you in other ways. If I were you, I would take the time to see how he is showing it in his own way. He could have been this whole time, but possibly because in your mind this 1 gesture would be how you want to receive his love and care, you might be overlooking other things he's doing.", "I was thinking get a velvetizer - hot chocolate maker - because it might get it into his head that you want him to do something sweet for you to make you feel appreciated and valued. Think you are going to have to phrase it in those terms that it isn't about the act, it's about what the act represents. That you want to help the other person because you value them. It is too easy to get into a routine and things become staid and accepted.", "This is for r/relationshipadvice..", "sounds like your issues is your inability to communicate clearly then.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f", "You're welcome! :-)", "I get what people are saying that coffee isn\u2019t the hill to die on, but it absolutely does matter if you ask your partner for something and they say yes, but then don\u2019t do it after multiple conversations.", "And polute the environment. Not to mention they're stupidly expensive. I hate those awful things. Useless fad invention. \n\n\nBut I'm going with NTA OP. You're right on the conflicting love language thing. Women always seemed more intuned to it. Perhaps gift your husband that love language book and highlight the section that describes what you need. Cause he doesn't seem to be getting it.", "Yeah I realize from my slightly unhinged emotional post that I didn\u2019t get this across, but we have HAD this conversation. I have explicitly stated what I wanted and why and he\u2019s been like \u201cyeah sounds good\u201d but then he doesn\u2019t do it. \nI guess the post should actually be titled \u201cAITA for wanting to be loved in the way I\u2019m asking for?\u201d Like yes, people should appreciate and allow their partner to show love in their own way, but everyone should also show their partner love in their partners language. Not just with romantic relationships. And no one should have to beg for that.", "Yeah I\u2019ve stated my desires in almost those exact words. \ud83d\ude14", "Ur right", "Not you aren\u2019t the A for wanting it.

I've had similar discussions though mine usually makes the coffee as he gets up at 5am. I do thank him or throw a pillow at him depending on when I got to bed. \n\nHave you tried not making him the coffee for a while? Because feeling uncared for might bring it home to him what you are feeling. But it is a hard one."]}
