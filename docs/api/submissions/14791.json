That\u2019s fine most of the time, but I\u2019ve told him multiple times that occasionally, I\u2019d appreciate having my coffee without having to ask. This has been a major source of disagreement before, because even after stating this desire, I always have to ask. Today, I was frustrated to start with, because yesterday I had told him I wanted coffee and his response was \u201cCoffee?? Oh no I don\u2019t want my coffee yet\u201d I didn\u2019t want to deal with the conversation at the time, so I just got up and made my coffee and later told him I wanted him to make the coffee tomorrow(I know it seems silly to plan ahead who\u2019s making coffee but again, this is a long-standing conversation. Also, sometimes he\u2019s accused me of getting mad at him for not meeting expectations that I didn\u2019t communicate, so expectation communicated, no?)\n\nAnd then today I still had to ask him again even though I had told him what I wanted. So I\u2019m like, when is the last time you had to ask for me to make your coffee? I know we both drink coffee every morning, so I make both of us coffee. Why don\u2019t I deserve the same treatment you\u2019re getting? \u201cOh but you want your coffee earlier than me so that\u2019s why you always make them.\u201d Yes but you know that and I told you that I wanted you to make the coffee today, so what gives? What does you wanting or not wanting coffee rn have to do with weather or not you make me coffee. And then it turned into a huge disagreement because I wanted to have a full conversation about it instead of letting him get away with \u201cwell next time you just have to ask and I\u2019ll do it\u201d No mf the entire point is that I don\u2019t want to have to ask for you to do something you already know I want. This is why I want to talk because our expectations are obviously not aligned, but he just get annoyed and lashes out with \u201cfine I\u2019ll make you coffee every day!\u201d type nonsense when I ask \u201cthis is what I want, what can I realistically expect from you?\u201d\n\nThe other thing he like to whip out is, \u201cI don\u2019t WANT you to make my coffee anymore\u201d and when I push back on that saying that\u2019s not a solution he tells me it is because the problem is that I\u2019m making coffee everyday thinking like \u201cugh I have to make this jerk his coffee every single day I hate this\u201d when the reality is that I actually genuinely enjoy giving him his coffee every morning. But at some point, I would find myself thinking \u201cman I wish someone would do this type of thing for me\u201d So I told him that I would really love it if he made the coffee sometimes without me having to ask for it. Like I guess this is a conflicting \u201clove languages\u201d thing. His is physical and mine is acts of service, but is the solution for that not stating expectations?

I just don't get why he's fighting you on it so much if you've expressed that its something you'd like him to do for you just to make you happy. There are plenty of small things my partner and I do for each other that may not seem like a big deal (one of which is making the coffee) but we do it because we love making the other happy.

It's not the small things, it's the build up of a bunch of small things that are showing they don't care. This isn't about the coffee. This is about the fact that you've communicated multiple times what you need and he doesn't care enough to do it. \n\nI'd also like to say, knowing your love languages is important so that you can show your person love in THEIR love language. If my husband's love language is physical touch and mine is acts and services, it's about how you receive love. You like to receive love in acts and services and he likes to receive love in touch. He needs to work on showing you love by your love language - acts and services!", "I have a feeling that coffee is the tip of the iceberg here... Do you feel unappreciated or that you are giving more in the relationship than they are? Deep down, we humans all want to be treated the same way we treat others. \n\nBut it's unrealistic to expect someone to love you the same way you love. Try looking for things that your partner does that they do (maybe automatically) that you appreciate they handle and you would be less than excited to do yourself, and see making coffee each morning for the both of you as how you can express to your partner how much they mean to you. \n\nGiving you a soft YTA\n\nEdit: updating to say I missed the part where he had agreed to do it a few times for you, I thought it was just you asking over and over despite him saying he didn't want to. That's a bit of a AH move on him to promise/agree then back out of it. NTA OP but make sure he understands this is more than coffee he's agreeing to and so the let down is much harder on you! Also the unrealistic part I'm referring to I will use my own relationship as an example. I'm a super romantic, do big gestures all the time type of gal. My husband is the complete opposite, as much as I would love a big romantic gesture for me, when he does something specifically to show me how much he loves me in his own way that's fine with me and it won't stop me from loving him in my way with the big gestures. Good luck!", "NTA. Clearly not about the coffee, you dummies! The issue is obviously that OP feels unappreciated. If the husband is asked to do something, confirms that he'll do it, then doesn't do it OVER AND OVER, it's clear that he's not pulling his weight, that he breaks his promises, and that he is not paying attention to what OP needs. He's probably doing this in lots of areas of the relationship.\n\nOP, you don't have a coffee problem; you have a husband problem.", "That sounds exhausting lol.  Maybe your love languages just don\u2019t mesh that well and because of that conflict is starting to rise", "NTA - All these comments about how easy it is to make coffee are completely missing the point.

If I understand it correctly, its not really about who does the chore of making coffee, but you want him to make you coffee occasionally because it's how you want to be loved. \n\nI'm conflicted because if my partner wanted me to make the coffee sometimes, I'd do it because it's very easy and important to them.

I don\u2019t think he sees it as you going too far out of your way to tap the button a couple more times when you\u2019re already in front of the machine, while asking him to get up and make you a coffee would be making him go out of his way.

OP should not expect her partner to change their entire love language to her love language, but they would need to meet in the middle somewhere and OP has communicated what her middle is, to which her partner has basically responded with \"no\", which is not fair to OP.
