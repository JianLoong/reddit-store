That\u2019s fine most of the time, but I\u2019ve told him multiple times that occasionally, I\u2019d appreciate having my coffee without having to ask. This has been a major source of disagreement before, because even after stating this desire, I always have to ask. Today, I was frustrated to start with, because yesterday I had told him I wanted coffee and his response was \u201cCoffee?? Oh no I don\u2019t want my coffee yet\u201d I didn\u2019t want to deal with the conversation at the time, so I just got up and made my coffee and later told him I wanted him to make the coffee tomorrow(I know it seems silly to plan ahead who\u2019s making coffee but again, this is a long-standing conversation. Also, sometimes he\u2019s accused me of getting mad at him for not meeting expectations that I didn\u2019t communicate, so expectation communicated, no?)\n\nAnd then today I still had to ask him again even though I had told him what I wanted. So I\u2019m like, when is the last time you had to ask for me to make your coffee? I know we both drink coffee every morning, so I make both of us coffee. Why don\u2019t I deserve the same treatment you\u2019re getting? \u201cOh but you want your coffee earlier than me so that\u2019s why you always make them.\u201d Yes but you know that and I told you that I wanted you to make the coffee today, so what gives? What does you wanting or not wanting coffee rn have to do with weather or not you make me coffee. And then it turned into a huge disagreement because I wanted to have a full conversation about it instead of letting him get away with \u201cwell next time you just have to ask and I\u2019ll do it\u201d No mf the entire point is that I don\u2019t want to have to ask for you to do something you already know I want. This is why I want to talk because our expectations are obviously not aligned, but he just get annoyed and lashes out with \u201cfine I\u2019ll make you coffee every day!\u201d type nonsense when I ask \u201cthis is what I want, what can I realistically expect from you?\u201d\n\nThe other thing he like to whip out is, \u201cI don\u2019t WANT you to make my coffee anymore\u201d and when I push back on that saying that\u2019s not a solution he tells me it is because the problem is that I\u2019m making coffee everyday thinking like \u201cugh I have to make this jerk his coffee every single day I hate this\u201d when the reality is that I actually genuinely enjoy giving him his coffee every morning. But at some point, I would find myself thinking \u201cman I wish someone would do this type of thing for me\u201d So I told him that I would really love it if he made the coffee sometimes without me having to ask for it. Like I guess this is a conflicting \u201clove languages\u201d thing. His is physical and mine is acts of service, but is the solution for that not stating expectations?

I just don't get why he's fighting you on it so much if you've expressed that its something you'd like him to do for you just to make you happy. There are plenty of small things my partner and I do for each other that may not seem like a big deal (one of which is making the coffee) but we do it because we love making the other happy.

It's not the small things, it's the build up of a bunch of small things that are showing they don't care. This isn't about the coffee. This is about the fact that you've communicated multiple times what you need and he doesn't care enough to do it. \n\nI'd also like to say, knowing your love languages is important so that you can show your person love in THEIR love language. If my husband's love language is physical touch and mine is acts and services, it's about how you receive love. You like to receive love in acts and services and he likes to receive love in touch. He needs to work on showing you love by your love language - acts and services!", "I have a feeling that coffee is the tip of the iceberg here... Do you feel unappreciated or that you are giving more in the relationship than they are? Deep down, we humans all want to be treated the same way we treat others. \n\nBut it's unrealistic to expect someone to love you the same way you love. Try looking for things that your partner does that they do (maybe automatically) that you appreciate they handle and you would be less than excited to do yourself, and see making coffee each morning for the both of you as how you can express to your partner how much they mean to you. \n\nGiving you a soft YTA\n\nEdit: updating to say I missed the part where he had agreed to do it a few times for you, I thought it was just you asking over and over despite him saying he didn't want to. That's a bit of a AH move on him to promise/agree then back out of it. NTA OP but make sure he understands this is more than coffee he's agreeing to and so the let down is much harder on you! Also the unrealistic part I'm referring to I will use my own relationship as an example. I'm a super romantic, do big gestures all the time type of gal. My husband is the complete opposite, as much as I would love a big romantic gesture for me, when he does something specifically to show me how much he loves me in his own way that's fine with me and it won't stop me from loving him in my way with the big gestures. Good luck!", "NTA. Clearly not about the coffee, you dummies! The issue is obviously that OP feels unappreciated. If the husband is asked to do something, confirms that he'll do it, then doesn't do it OVER AND OVER, it's clear that he's not pulling his weight, that he breaks his promises, and that he is not paying attention to what OP needs. He's probably doing this in lots of areas of the relationship.\n\nOP, you don't have a coffee problem; you have a husband problem.", "That sounds exhausting lol.

If I understand it correctly, its not really about who does the chore of making coffee, but you want him to make you coffee occasionally because it's how you want to be loved. \n\nI'm conflicted because if my partner wanted me to make the coffee sometimes, I'd do it because it's very easy and important to them.

OP should not expect her partner to change their entire love language to her love language, but they would need to meet in the middle somewhere and OP has communicated what her middle is, to which her partner has basically responded with \"no\", which is not fair to OP.

You\u2019re very clear about what you need from him and he immediately gets defensive saying, \u201cfine, I guess I\u2019ll just never have you make coffee for me anymore because clearly you find it so daunting\u201d when that\u2019s not even remotely the case or the point. This is such an exhausting situation to be in and I\u2019m so sorry this simple matter of wanting someone to do something nice for you without being asked has turned into such bs.\n\nI also very much want to take everyone who ever says \u201cwell just ask me and I\u2019ll do it!\u201d by the shoulders, shake them, look them dead in the eyes, and imprint \u201cthat\u2019s not the fucking point\u201d on their souls. It is genuinely not that hard to make simple, kind gestures for someone like making a cup of freaking coffee. Especially when you have literally begged that they occasionally make that gesture for you. Ugh.", ">The other thing he like to whip out is, \u201cI don\u2019t WANT you to make my coffee anymore\u201d and when I push back on that saying that\u2019s not a solution\n\nIt sounds like a very reasonable solution.\n\nYou keep pointing out you make his coffee without him asking. Has he *ever* asked. You can't just do things then think it means the person owes you. Just each make your own coffee and stop being ridiculous", "NTA. you have asked and he has ignored it.  When people show you who they are, believe them.  He never intends to make you coffee and wants you to feel bad about asking", "Nta.  Reminds me of the \u201cwhy your girlfriend just broke up with you\u201d video.  Show it to this dude?  \nAlso, coffee machines with timers he could set up the night before, or set an alarm on his phone that says \u201cmake coffee for your love,\u201d or DoorDash a gourmet coffee to yourself in the morning and act surprised that he wanted one too.", "NTA. And I\u2019m gonna say \u201cjust ask\u201d but not for the reason other ppl are saying it. I\u2019d ask him outright to see if he says no to a direct request. I would be curious to see if he is truly just lacking in thoughtfulness/awareness or if he\u2019s directly just not wanting to do it for you in general.", "This takes high maintenance to the next level!\n\nWell done!", "NTA.  \nIt's really disappointing when someone refuses to love you in a way that actually makes you feel loved - especially when you're specifically asking for it. \n\nIt's obviously not about the coffee. It's the idea of your partner thinking of you and doing something to make your life the tiniest bit easier/more enjoyable in that moment. Ask yourself if he can't be bothered to show up for you with the little things if you really think he'll be able to show up for the big ones.", "NTA, from how I'm understanding the story.  That said, while your scrub is in the wrong here, it seems more like he's failing to understand where you're coming from, instead of having a strange fetish against making coffee.  Honestly, I'd recommend you show him what you've written, because when it's laid out in black and white like that, it might be easier for him to absorb than during what appears to be a teeth-grinding conversation.", "NTA but your partner is so selfish he can\u2019t even comprehend that reciprocation is where you take turns doing things for each other, not where he only does things for you only if he\u2019s also doing them for himself. He\u2019s deeply, deeply selfish, and I\u2019m sad for you.", "INFO\u2014\nIs this the only thing you want him to do to be considerate of you? What does he do to show he thinks and cares about you?", "I\u2019m confused, he doesn\u2019t want to make you coffee because it\u2019s too early for him to drink his own coffee and he doesn\u2019t want it, but when you make coffee for yourself and him he\u2019ll have it? Even though it\u2019s earlier than when he actually wants coffee? So in reality he can\u2019t blame the timing. NTA. You\u2019ve made a reasonable request, communicated it clearly, he agreed and then didn\u2019t follow through.", "NTA", "So I had a hard time following this but I guess I need more INFO. Are you making the coffee because you get up earlier/want it first? If that\u2019s true, it makes sense to you to make the coffee and it doesn\u2019t take any more effort to make coffee for two as it does to make coffee for one. It doesn\u2019t make sense for your partner to get up earlier and make coffee for both of you and that\u2019s probably what he\u2019s reacting to. \n\n\nAll that said, I sense that you just want to feel loved and appreciated. That\u2019s totally valid. I just kinda think you\u2019d have more luck having that conversation instead of talking about coffee, which he probably just doesn\u2019t understand", "NTA. 1. You have expressed a clear need and desire in your relationship, one that is very low effort and easily achievable, and he has deemed it irrelevant and not worth attempting even once. 2. It's not about the coffee. It's about demonstrating that he thought about your needs and cared enough to fill one of them. 3. It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense to him because you get coffee before he does. He's decided he'd rather be right than be helpful and caring. \n\nCoincidentally enough, my husband brought me coffee today on his way home from a doctor's appointment. He knew I was really low on energy today. Sometimes, I'll ask him to grab me a coffee while he's out, but the fact that he got me one without being asked showed that he was thinking about me and how I was feeling. That's all you're looking for, and it is NOT a big ask", "I don\u2019t even drink coffee but I will make my wife coffee if I\u2019m up before her. It\u2019s not about the coffee.

I'm working, as usual, and my GF who had no job was laying in bed and yelled at me to bring her coffee. I took a kcup, put it in a coffee cup, and handed it to her dry.\n\nShe's not around any more. Thankfully. \n\nFfs, this is about control, not coffee.\n\nIf he does not want to participate in your morning coffee lovefest stop making it for him.\n\nHaving said that, it would not kill him to participate in your morning coffee lovefest. That's the sort of stuff couples do.\n\nEither way, I think you are both being AH.", "Ugh did I miss the part you two were married? If not, he\u2019s not the one. He\u2019s not the one who will be there for you when you need him, like when you need chemo or an operation. He\u2019s showing you how much he cares about you. If my partner knew i wanted coffee, he\u2019d be making one every day. \n\nIt\u2019s too much work asking someone constantly the same thing over and over, you\u2019d be more at peace without him bc this isn\u2019t about making coffee, it\u2019s about him not showing his care for you. \n\nIf you choose to stay with him, then just make yourself coffee. Treat him in the same energy he treats you. No more making him his dinner or doing his laundry. \n\nYou\u2019re not alone - there\u2019s a whole discussion going at tt about this very thing.", "maybe try to keep making you both coffee but try to find some other little thing he can do for you (both) every day", "This has nothing to do with coffee.  It\u2019s about control.  \n\nBuy a Keurig and make yourself a cup.  He can make his own coffee.\n\nPeople who avoid a reasonable resolution to an issue  are usually people who get enjoyment from arguing or from getting under your skin. It\u2019s all about control, and he has you upset and dancing like a puppet.  You think it\u2019s a problem about coffee and he\u2019s messing with you like a cat plays with it\u2019s prey.", "It's a stupid thing to argue about.  If that's your biggest frustration, you are exceptionally lucky.", "I came here to say this same thing. \n\nIt\u2019s not about coffee, it\u2019s about feeling unappreciated. \n\nOP, instead of making it about the coffee, be honest with your feelings and how you feel in the relationship. \n\nI have had this same issue with my husband.

Does he always take the garbage out without being asked? Does he pick up the mail? Does he always gas the car?\nThere\u2019s usually something like that here.", "Yes. It\u2019s easy to make coffee, but the joy and love you feel when someone brings you a coffee is so much more than the minute it takes to make.", "Thanks for this. I\u2019ve been gradually getting to that point of being done these last couple months. We have so much love, but he just outright refuses to show it in the way that I\u2019m begging for. There\u2019s been a couple conversations lately where he\u2019s told me he would do things that he\u2019s failed in the past and when I push back that we\u2019ve had this conversation and he hasn\u2019t followed through so I need more than a simple yeah I\u2019ll do it, he says that we never talked about it like that before but now he understands, so I should accept what he\u2019s saying.

That's exactly what this made me think of.", "He gets up first, about 30min before me. We chill awhile on the couch reading and such and then I get up and make us both coffee. It would be very very easy for him to beat me to the espresso machine if he wanted to do it. Barring that, he could also easily stop me and be like \u201cno, wait let me do that for you today\u201d since he has agreed that making coffee without being asked to is a reasonable thing for him to be able to do occasionally. Just occasionally for him is like once every 3 years or something I guess. \n\n(Also we live in a very small apartment it\u2019s impossible for one of us to make coffee without the other one knowing about it)", "Thank you so much for understanding what\u2019s actually going on here.

It helps with understanding someone else\u2019s expressions of love.

But English (or whatever you speak) supersedes \u201clove languages.\u201d If grandma keeps plying you with food after you ask her not to, that\u2019s not love anymore. That\u2019s stubbornness or control or martyrdom.", "Your post as it originally was didn\u2019t do the best job explaining that he actually says yes when you ask him to make you coffee. I understand this now.\n\nI\u2019ll just say this. Are you the asshole for wanting him to change this behavior? No. But I do think you\u2019re fooling yourself if you think continuing to talk to him about it is going to change anything? Yeah. He seems perfectly content just pacifying you with words, so he\u2019s probably just going to continue doing that. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Is he generally useless, or only when he's just woken up?

No-one is *that* bad at mornings. He's being a selfish jerk.", ">because I make his almost every day without being asked\n\nyou need to let this part go.

Always have a hot fresh cup of coffee. I use a reusable refillable mesh pod that I fill with my own blend (half decaf cuz i\u2019m a quantity over quality gal).

My sister leaves me coffee and eggs everyday bc she wakes up earlier, I make her dinner vc I work less hours. And thats my younger sibiling. If your SO cant even compromise with the little things that make your day happy, a relationship is in a complicated spot. We all deserve someone that Will treat us a nice coffee sometimes", "NAH. Honestly I think you need to decide if this relationship is acceptable to you. If overall it is but you feel you want more day to day care then insist upon counseling for the two of you. I say counseling because you say that multiple conversations have not gotten you what you need. It\u2019s better for both of you to sit down and work out what both of you need with a professional rather than stew in resentment.", "It\u2019s not about the coffee. It\u2019s that when you wake up, you\u2019re thinking of him and doing something that makes his day better. When he wakes up, he can\u2019t be bothered to think of you even if you ask him to.  It\u2019s very likely that this pops up in other parts of your relationship as well.", "Tbh, I would only make coffee for me going forward."]}
