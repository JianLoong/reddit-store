Tell him to mind his own household and butt out.", "I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA in a strict sense, because it seems like all the adults and children involved here fully understood how the reward system worked. It\u2019s silly to expect that you\u2019ll change the rules midstream just because one child didn\u2019t earn their reward. \n\nI\u2019m also assuming that this is positive reinforcement only (meaning that your son isn\u2019t being punished for having a lower GPA; he\u2019s just not being rewarded).\n\nHowever, I think this is a good time to reconsider the motivations for your reward system and whether it\u2019s fulfilling its intended function. Centering everything on grades teaches children to focus only on the outcome and not the process/journey of getting there, which is where the learning actually happens. I\u2019d suggest moving to an alternative reward system based more on effort and participation.", "NTA. If you don't meet the criteria, you don't get the reward.

There were some report cards I didn\u2019t and I was not rewarded.", "NTA. However I would suggest making the reward something that wouldn't really give the other a big advantage. Like for example ONLY having to choose where to eat next WITH THE FAMILY. By then you are having them eat what they want in in the place the other so wishes. Of course I would say there could still be drama but it shouldn't be that bad, after all at the end of the day good food is good food, who will say no to it?\n\nPersonally, I don't recommend adding money as it does sparks conflict. Just the stuff that will make a kid's day and wouldn't last for a long time. \n\nAs for other stuff, yeah I agree with the other posters, try checking if your kid is just into something else that's not in the four corners of the wall, or just have other way of learning.", "NTA\n\nIgnore all the everyone should get money and it's cruel to reward some and not all people.\n\nYou have three kids....you're using this to motivate good grades....\n\nI would check in with your son however and find out why he has B and C's. You said he cried about how his classes are harder. Honors classes are meant to be harder..they challenge those who need it and have perks like college credit etc. You don't get into honors classes without having high grades, high test scores, and teacher recommendations. Check with your son and his teachers separately to see what's going on. Is the workload too much and he's not turning stuff in?? Poor tests scores?? is he not understanding the subject ?? He might need to placed into regular class for math and not an honors one.\n\nOnce you figure out the problem you can always adapt or come up with a new motivator for him that addresses his issue. For instance you could always split up the money... 25 for all As.... And you get ten if all tests scores are above 85%. Or all the homework is turned in....etc......\n\nSit him down and discuss it with him again. Maybe change your wording to make it more relatable. The money is a reward for completing a goal. He didn't complete the goal. Find out why and come up with a new goal plan. Then it's in his court to complete.  No one can do it for him....at the end of he needs to achieve his goal. Ask for help if needed. But at the end of the day money won't be handed out unless his goal is met.\n\nEdit to add also do you have nonacademic rewards?? Like they get cash for doing extra chores (not their daily chores) or babysitting etc??.....\n\nAnd if your ex feels differently he can do his own rewards system then and payout your kids seperate from you. Just remind him the goal is to get increase and maintain good grades. .....\n\nYou could also consider GPAs instead as well...... Keep us updated!", "I do think all As with easy classes isn\u2019t same as all As with harder classes and being too focused on As can encourage taking easy classes.  I\u2019ve seen it happen\n\nSo maybe do some adjustments of Bs for AP/college prep.  Sounds like he\u2019d still fail right now, but may be more motivational if feels actually obtainable\n\nMaybe have some \u201cimprovement\u201d goals - like can get dinner if moves the C to a B and nothing gets worse.  \n\nNTA in that no one kid doesn\u2019t get a reward just b/c other does.  Defeats the purpose.  But focus on letter grades can be VERY misleading and can miss actually evaluating effort", "YTA. Are the kids learning? Are they putting in their best effort? My parents tried to pull this crap on us when we were growing up, but there were no rewards, only punishments for not getting straight As. Even if we got on the honor roll, it wasn't enough since we didn't have \"perfect\" straight A grades. Way to give your kids a perfectionism complex. What's the point of taking more difficult classes and actually learning when taking easy classes nets the reward?\n\nFor context, I took algebra as a freshman in high school, and I was a \"young\" student since I started kindergarten early. So I was 13-14 that year. Sibling took algebra as a senior and had started kindergarten late, so sibling was 18 years old. BIG difference! I then was required to take geometry, calculus, trigonometry, and advanced algebra during high school. That \"math\" was difficult, and the teachers weren't too great at explaining it or realizing students had different learning styles.\n\nSibling still to this day rubs it in my nose that they were a straight A student while I wasn't. There's obviously no comparison, but there's no explaining that to our parents or siblings. Only the end result ever mattered to them - straight As.

Only 3 out of 156 achieved that, in my year.", "Following the rules of the deal is not unfair. But the rules themselves probably are.\n\nSome kids are just never going to be straight A students and failure after failure in the face of a sibling who succeeds is going to really sting and be bad for them. Even a good student might have a hard time with straight As if they face a weakness in one of their classes. But I'd at least set the line at all Bs. Which I think is achievable for most kids **IF** they put the work in.\n\nThey still wouldn't have qualified. But if your son got Bs and Cs you might have gotten more effort out of him and gotten all Bs with that. Plenty of kids will look at a goal out of reach and not even try to improve because it's there.", "Maybe TA? Reward effort and progress not grades. People can collect As on report cards and not actually do or learn anything. Someone may earn Bs and Cs and be taking advantage of every opportunity to get extra help, doing extra assignments, etc. making a substantial effort and making progress since the last report card, but it won\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d because it\u2019s not an A.

NAH in my opinion, but I know many others might disagree. I see concerns with the reward system and don't disagree, but high school is a good time to start teaching life lessons and performance metrics are very much a part of many jobs. It sucks, but you ARE judged on your performance. I don't think all or nothing is the way to go, though. It gives the impression that anything less than perfection isn't tolerated, and that is not true in the real world either", "YTA. Sure, these are the rules but they were set by you for some reason or other. \n\nWhy don't you reward effort? Improvement? \n\nYour kids are individuals and as such one might have an easier time getting good grades than the other. One might have a more difficult subject, one might have stricter teachers, or be occupied with getting better at a sport, or other talents. \n\nI was that kid.

I would have been absolutely devastated if my sibling got rewarded for something that came easy to them and I punished for even trying.", "Without more info I have to go with YTA. The attitude that every kid can just get an A in every subject if they just try hard enough is just not true. It completely discounts so many things it\u2019s ridiculous and shows you know very little about education.\n\nSome kids excel in specific areas and struggle greatly in others.

I was terrible at tests and knew the answers but just couldn\u2019t put it together in a test setting but practically I was very good. As long as your son is doing everything he can to earn those grades then that\u2019s all you can ask as a parent.

BUT. When you take an internal motivation (in this case: learning), and make it an external motivation (food/money), you minimize the actual things school is trying to impart. An interest and a sense of achievement.\n\nI'll tell you what the research says.\n\nRather than a reward system, which will hurt more than help, work with your children to figure out what kind of environmental or physical items they need to do better. Would they appreciate a tutor? Would they prefer a better study area? better headphones to listen to music while they study? time/study management skills? things like that. Doing this reinforces the idea studying is an ongoing process, not something you do to get a monetary reward. Support their efforts, and help with their frustrations. don't bribe them. You're not their employer, you're their parent.\n\nThis is why some parents have chores which must be done just as because they live there, and then allowance comes from extra work that falls outside of chores or necessities.\n\nUse food and money to celebrate milestones, not as a system to promote particular behaviour. Down that path lies madness and destruction.", "Mild YTA.

Ideally you would set up a system that rewards effort/improvement over specific grades.", "NTA\n\nPeople think your being unfair but this is the world we live in. Preparing you kids for that is a good thing. Work hard do well=reward. Work hard do meh=not as much of a reward. Work meh do meh = nada.", "I think your system is unjust and unfair.

Your proposed reward didn't function as a motivator this time. Your one size fits all approach is going to fail eventually. You're NTA, but you sound checked out.", "If he\u2019s been getting As without studying and putting in minimal work then the system wasn\u2019t working. He wasn\u2019t working harder to try to get straight As to get the reward, it was happening naturally and he enjoyed the reward he got as a result.\n\nNow that he\u2019s seeing he can\u2019t get straight As naturally without putting in extra work anymore, the rewards system can actually start to motivate him to put in the extra work to improve his grades. But there\u2019s also a chance that he can start putting in more work and focusing on his schoolwork and studying and still not get straight As anymore. You need to reevaluate your rewards system. If the purpose is to motivate them to work hard at school rather than just coasting through and doing what they need to do to pass, you need to reward them for actually putting in extra effort rather than a reward based on grades. Give them the reward if you see that they spent a certain amount of hours studying, or that they completed all their assignments on time, or if you see that they\u2019re prioritizing homework over hanging out with friends or watching tv, etc.", "Then, it's time to reevaluate. It's now working against you. Classes were simpler. Therefore, it was easy to get the grades. Because of that, he went into advanced classes. Now, they are not so simple, and he's become discouraged. That's what happens when you set the bar extremely high. The reward has now become a punishment. \n\nIt's also never a good idea to set the expectations that high. When you do, you set them up for a big downfall should they not meet that expectation. The first time they get anything less than a perfect grade, it can cause a great deal of distress and anxiety. They will feel that they've disappointed everyone and leaving them feeling less than. Which it what you're now facing with one. They've given up.", "And, since you awarded grades, not effort, he put no effort. No, the system wasn't working.", "Maybe a reward for studying and putting in the effort would have been more helpful than a reward for the grade itself. Might be something you can implement going forward, although it would definitely be subjective on your part to assess if the goal of studying more was met.", "You know what\u2019s funny, my whole life my older sister was the perfect straight A student while I struggled to get Bs and Cs. I used to be so resentful of her and how easy school came to her compared to me and how everyone seemed to think I just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough. \n\nMany years later she confessed to me that she actually struggled horribly in high school, but she was so anxious about maintaining her image as a straight A student that she just started cheating. As long as she got good grades people were happy with her so she stopped caring about how she achieved them.", "Parents are supposed to teach their children to work hard for things they want. You\u2019re doing a good job, and your son is learning the other half of the lesson (don\u2019t get the results, don\u2019t get the reward). \n\nYou will be criticized by people of the r/antiwork mindset who think meritocracy and hard work are bad things. You should ignore them.", "Do you know if there's any chance your child might be neurodivergent? This sounds very similar to what happened with me, and I have ADHD and Autism.\n\nAlso it might be worth it to work together with your kid on learning HOW to study, as many kids who don't need to study in elementary and middle never develop the skills needed, and find themselves Floundering when all of a sudden they're in a situation where they need to to perform at the same level.\n\nThere's also likely an aspect of shame with that as well, \"I was doing so well before, and i never had to study, why can't I do that now?\" \n\nLetting this go unregulated, and without support (do not let him refuse to allow you to study with him, he will not magically learn how to study on his own, and often times children will refuse help due to shame or pride, ESPECIALLY gifted kids,) will only lead to your child pushing themselves until they hit burnout.\n\nIf he's neurodivergent, then burnout could become a disabling event, I would know, I hit it by junior year and it was pretty disabling for me, I graduated in 2020, and I'm just now making noticable progress in recovering from burnout.", "I would suggest giving him a reward next report card if he improves his grades (not just straight A's) and making that clear to him. And if you see him putting in the work but the grades still don't improve, that could be worth a reward as well. The goal is to motivate him. You don't want to unintentionally pit him against his sibling or make him feel like there's no point in trying if he can't get straight A's.", "but he isn't working his but off...the kid admitted that he hasn't been studying.  this isn't a situation where he is trying his best and just isn't smart enough to get A's.", "meh, I hope you have the day you deserve.", "Yeah, learning how to study is super important, and I think a lot of kids who start out getting good grades without really trying end up hitting a wall when the material starts challenging them for the first time. It\u2019s good for him to learn that skill now!", "So he needs help. Coaching on better study habits. To learn \\*how\\* to study.  \n\n\nHe was doing what worked for him and it doesn't anymore.", "I was the same....got all A's until the point I couldn't coast anymore and had to study.  I still chose not to study and got a mix of A's and B's.  I would expect he is capable of getting A's.   He needs to decide if he wants to try to or not.", "Sorry about that I will fix it", "Not sure why you think I\u2019m a karma farmer? I\u2019m just on vacation with a little more time to kill.", "Which I why I suggest the system my grandma used, and not an all or nothing.", "Again, why not reward a consistent and strong effort? What else could you expect of him?  \n\n\nWhat you're saying is \"a student is doing everything expected to the best of their ability, but didn't get a  high enough grade so no reward for their work\".  \n\n\nI know people (I was one, back in the day) who could coast through High School and earn A's.  I know some who needed to work their tail off to get a B. Which are more deserving of a reward?", "Then she should continue offering more help and maybe change the reward system, like maybe giving a small amount of money per each A or B, or maybe pay them both nothing at all.", "Yes exactly, this is why I'm saying that this parent in specific maybe needs to change the system and prioritize finding a way to help the struggling kid.", "But my two examples are ways in that results matter more than effort.", "And results take effort. It\u2019s a kid. They\u2019re *learning* so help them *learn*. if he puts in 100% effort and still gets a B, and then doesn\u2019t get the reward, why bother trying at all next semester? Plus, the end goal here is learning the material. If you learn the material and get a B, you still succeeded.", "I was a teacher for a bit. I had kids that had a negative charisma score that would do some of the above and I would still work to get them passing. If you have a high charisma it means you can do less than the above. Heck, I had kids that I kind of despised on a personal level that did the above and I made sure they passed.", "Not at all. I said improve *or* maintain. It stays exactly the same for her if she's consistently getting straight A's and just opens the opportunity for her brother to catch up. It's almost, if not fully, impossible to turn a C into an A with cumulative grading, unless you have the ability to redo lower assignments/tests and fully replace the grades (which is very uncommon.) So even though the year just started, he's already got no reason to even try because there's no chance at a reward for the rest of the academic year.", "Oh course I did, it\u2019s the classic I got it, I know responses", "But it seems her son isn't putting in the effort by his own admission.", "You're a joke.

I do notecard and I have suggested that before.

Except I was the student and behavioral problems are exceedingly common in my community.", "Exactly. Kids should be given whatever they want whether or not they actually earned it.", "This isn\u2019t some novel project being tackled in an uncertain environment - results here are pretty directly correlated to work put in (including the work of asking for extra help/tutors when necessary).

Which was weird because I was in honors math. I was just not getting how the teacher was explaining it. After my first C where it was clear I wasn\u2019t getting things my mom just decided I needed a tutor. She could see I was struggling and just went ahead and got me the help. That same year I asked for a grammar tutor and the following year I asked for a French tutor. I needed the help. And I\u2019m someone who went on to a STEM field and have two masters degrees. \n\nIt\u2019s on you to pick up on this and tell son that you will be getting him a tutor to help him figure out what works (like training wheels) once he\u2019s feeling confident the tutor can go away.", "Actually it would only demotivate the girl that gets straight A's, it would change nothing for the kid that's struggling because he already gets no rewards.\nBesides it's not like money is a universal solution for motivation, as soon as you don't get a reward you start to question the system, the kid only wants good grades because of the money, when he got bad grades and no money he started demanding money for nothing, because this motivation system is flawed.", "Yup I agree wholeheartedly with you, the world isn't as black and white as you get a reward for doing good.", "Yes you're right, but hypothetically speaking, if a kid gets taught that all that matters is the results, they might not think twice before doing something that might ensure results, even if it's illegal.", "Right, and if he put in effort (which he isn\u2019t) that c might become a b. But if he knows that the effort doesn\u2019t matter unless he gets an A, then why bother? That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying reward the effort.", "I\u2019m going to give him a chance to course correct first, I know he would hate tutoring and it would damping his self esteem much more than a bad grade.", "I never mentioned that results are all that mattered. Don't put words in my mouth.\n\nThe knowledge and effort of school students is sufficiently recorded throughout the year via participation, homework, whatever\n\nTests and their results measure another important life skill: Can You keep Your wits about You with the slight pressure of a running clock?

No but I worked my ass of studied products and worked on myself. \n\nSchool is not that hard unless you have a learning disability.

There are a multitude of reasons to find school difficult, from a difficult home life to mental or physical illness.", "And I got all As except one out of 6 of my AP classes where I worked my ass off and still got a B.

It's not a yes or no thing. But I often see empty, misguided effort ruining potentially good results. \n\nI also detest behaviouristic reward models. They take the joy out of getting there.
