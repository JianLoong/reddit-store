Tell him to mind his own household and butt out.", "I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA in a strict sense, because it seems like all the adults and children involved here fully understood how the reward system worked. It\u2019s silly to expect that you\u2019ll change the rules midstream just because one child didn\u2019t earn their reward. \n\nI\u2019m also assuming that this is positive reinforcement only (meaning that your son isn\u2019t being punished for having a lower GPA; he\u2019s just not being rewarded).\n\nHowever, I think this is a good time to reconsider the motivations for your reward system and whether it\u2019s fulfilling its intended function. Centering everything on grades teaches children to focus only on the outcome and not the process/journey of getting there, which is where the learning actually happens. I\u2019d suggest moving to an alternative reward system based more on effort and participation.", "NTA. If you don't meet the criteria, you don't get the reward.

Like for example ONLY having to choose where to eat next WITH THE FAMILY. By then you are having them eat what they want in in the place the other so wishes. Of course I would say there could still be drama but it shouldn't be that bad, after all at the end of the day good food is good food, who will say no to it?\n\nPersonally, I don't recommend adding money as it does sparks conflict. Just the stuff that will make a kid's day and wouldn't last for a long time. \n\nAs for other stuff, yeah I agree with the other posters, try checking if your kid is just into something else that's not in the four corners of the wall, or just have other way of learning.", "NTA\n\nIgnore all the everyone should get money and it's cruel to reward some and not all people.\n\nYou have three kids....you're using this to motivate good grades....\n\nI would check in with your son however and find out why he has B and C's. You said he cried about how his classes are harder. Honors classes are meant to be harder..they challenge those who need it and have perks like college credit etc. You don't get into honors classes without having high grades, high test scores, and teacher recommendations. Check with your son and his teachers separately to see what's going on. Is the workload too much and he's not turning stuff in?? Poor tests scores?? is he not understanding the subject ?? He might need to placed into regular class for math and not an honors one.\n\nOnce you figure out the problem you can always adapt or come up with a new motivator for him that addresses his issue. For instance you could always split up the money... 25 for all As.... And you get ten if all tests scores are above 85%. Or all the homework is turned in....etc......\n\nSit him down and discuss it with him again. Maybe change your wording to make it more relatable. The money is a reward for completing a goal. He didn't complete the goal. Find out why and come up with a new goal plan. Then it's in his court to complete.  No one can do it for him....at the end of he needs to achieve his goal. Ask for help if needed. But at the end of the day money won't be handed out unless his goal is met.\n\nEdit to add also do you have nonacademic rewards?? Like they get cash for doing extra chores (not their daily chores) or babysitting etc??.....\n\nAnd if your ex feels differently he can do his own rewards system then and payout your kids seperate from you. Just remind him the goal is to get increase and maintain good grades. .....\n\nYou could also consider GPAs instead as well...... Keep us updated!", "I do think all As with easy classes isn\u2019t same as all As with harder classes and being too focused on As can encourage taking easy classes.  I\u2019ve seen it happen\n\nSo maybe do some adjustments of Bs for AP/college prep.  Sounds like he\u2019d still fail right now, but may be more motivational if feels actually obtainable\n\nMaybe have some \u201cimprovement\u201d goals - like can get dinner if moves the C to a B and nothing gets worse.  \n\nNTA in that no one kid doesn\u2019t get a reward just b/c other does.  Defeats the purpose.  But focus on letter grades can be VERY misleading and can miss actually evaluating effort", "YTA. Are the kids learning? Are they putting in their best effort? My parents tried to pull this crap on us when we were growing up, but there were no rewards, only punishments for not getting straight As. Even if we got on the honor roll, it wasn't enough since we didn't have \"perfect\" straight A grades. Way to give your kids a perfectionism complex. What's the point of taking more difficult classes and actually learning when taking easy classes nets the reward?\n\nFor context, I took algebra as a freshman in high school, and I was a \"young\" student since I started kindergarten early. So I was 13-14 that year. Sibling took algebra as a senior and had started kindergarten late, so sibling was 18 years old. BIG difference! I then was required to take geometry, calculus, trigonometry, and advanced algebra during high school. That \"math\" was difficult, and the teachers weren't too great at explaining it or realizing students had different learning styles.\n\nSibling still to this day rubs it in my nose that they were a straight A student while I wasn't. There's obviously no comparison, but there's no explaining that to our parents or siblings. Only the end result ever mattered to them - straight As.

Only 3 out of 156 achieved that, in my year.", "Following the rules of the deal is not unfair. But the rules themselves probably are.\n\nSome kids are just never going to be straight A students and failure after failure in the face of a sibling who succeeds is going to really sting and be bad for them.

Which I think is achievable for most kids **IF** they put the work in.\n\nThey still wouldn't have qualified. But if your son got Bs and Cs you might have gotten more effort out of him and gotten all Bs with that. Plenty of kids will look at a goal out of reach and not even try to improve because it's there.", "Maybe TA? Reward effort and progress not grades. People can collect As on report cards and not actually do or learn anything. Someone may earn Bs and Cs and be taking advantage of every opportunity to get extra help, doing extra assignments, etc. making a substantial effort and making progress since the last report card, but it won\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d because it\u2019s not an A.

I see concerns with the reward system and don't disagree, but high school is a good time to start teaching life lessons and performance metrics are very much a part of many jobs. It sucks, but you ARE judged on your performance. I don't think all or nothing is the way to go, though. It gives the impression that anything less than perfection isn't tolerated, and that is not true in the real world either", "YTA. Sure, these are the rules but they were set by you for some reason or other. \n\nWhy don't you reward effort? Improvement? \n\nYour kids are individuals and as such one might have an easier time getting good grades than the other. One might have a more difficult subject, one might have stricter teachers, or be occupied with getting better at a sport, or other talents. \n\nI was that kid. My sibling had a really easy time in school and got As all the time. I didn't even though I was tutored, spent time studying and really tried. I would have been absolutely devastated if my sibling got rewarded for something that came easy to them and I punished for even trying.", "Without more info I have to go with YTA. The attitude that every kid can just get an A in every subject if they just try hard enough is just not true. It completely discounts so many things it\u2019s ridiculous and shows you know very little about education.\n\nSome kids excel in specific areas and struggle greatly in others.

Your son may not be naturally good academically but be better practically. All kids learn differently and have different abilities. I wouldn\u2019t say reward either child tbh and just give praise where it is due and offer support where needed and acknowledge the effort being put in. I was terrible at tests and knew the answers but just couldn\u2019t put it together in a test setting but practically I was very good. As long as your son is doing everything he can to earn those grades then that\u2019s all you can ask as a parent.

BUT. When you take an internal motivation (in this case: learning), and make it an external motivation (food/money), you minimize the actual things school is trying to impart. An interest and a sense of achievement.\n\nI'll tell you what the research says.\n\nRather than a reward system, which will hurt more than help, work with your children to figure out what kind of environmental or physical items they need to do better. Would they appreciate a tutor? Would they prefer a better study area? better headphones to listen to music while they study? time/study management skills? things like that. Doing this reinforces the idea studying is an ongoing process, not something you do to get a monetary reward. Support their efforts, and help with their frustrations. don't bribe them. You're not their employer, you're their parent.\n\nThis is why some parents have chores which must be done just as because they live there, and then allowance comes from extra work that falls outside of chores or necessities.\n\nUse food and money to celebrate milestones, not as a system to promote particular behaviour. Down that path lies madness and destruction.", "Mild YTA.

Ideally you would set up a system that rewards effort/improvement over specific grades.", "NTA\n\nPeople think your being unfair but this is the world we live in. Preparing you kids for that is a good thing. Work hard do well=reward. Work hard do meh=not as much of a reward. Work meh do meh = nada.", "I think your system is unjust and unfair.

They are very different and holding them to the same standard would be wrong.  I truly think the grading system just rewards kids who can fit into 'the box'.

Some kids have better executive function than others, so they have a harder time doing things like studying. It's not their fault and you have to love them all regardless. Punishing a kid with lower executive function for not studying is like punishing a kid with a big appetite for eating too much: punishment isn't something that can help solve the problem. Your oldest sounds like she's going places. Great for her! That has its own rewards, such as praise from you and from teachers, and access to more opportunities later on. Your son sounds like he's struggling a bit. He is not getting those intrinsic rewards. I assure you, he is aware of this. To give your daughter an additional reward is adding insult to injury.
