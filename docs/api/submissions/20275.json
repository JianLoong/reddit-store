I got upset and said since it was my day i felt like they stole that day from me.

This event isn't about you it's about celebrating your son and everyone else who is paying for the class. (I think it's weird the school is mixing ages like that within a single class, but that's sort of beside the point here).\n\nWho are you to tell another student they have to miss their promotion just because you're too insecure to see your ex's new partner getting along with your son? If anything, you should be grateful that she's found someone who cares about and supports your son instead of all of the crappy stories we see on here with partners treating kids like garbage.", "YTA. This is a belt promotion ceremony for anyone in the class. The boyfriend is in the class, it\u2019s a public space, you have no right to insist he doesn\u2019t attend. Get over it", "YTA.\n\nStop competing with your ex's bf.  He apparently is now in your son's life and you had better find a way to co-parent nicely.  Your son will greatly benefit from a cooperative relationship.  If you don't, your son will figure it out and your relationship with him will go south.\n\nAnd the more people that love your son, the better for him.  Your son isn't choosing between you and your ex's bf.  There is room for both of you in his life.", "INFO: how does testing work at this school?  At the studio my kid and I took lessons, testing days were on a set schedule, and everyone tested at the same time.  So if you don't want BF testing at the same time as son, that would be saying he can't test at all, and would make you an AH.  Same question re classes.  Our studio has two all ages classes a week so that parents and kids, or different age siblings can go together, but most are age segregated.  \n\nHave you considered taking classes yourself?  Then you could do these things with your son and not just watch.", "YTA - The man can go wherever he wants.", "YTA. You are making this a big deal when it's not.", "YTA. You can\u2019t tell him not to use the gym your kid is at. Not to mention, even if he wasn\u2019t literally taking the class, I think they should have been allowed to come to see him get promoted to yellow if it\u2019s something important to your son. If he gets into tournaments would you expect only the parent with custody that day gets to go?\n\n\nYou are being unreasonable. YTA", "You are N T A for wanting to drive him on your days. But it\u2019s possible the BF was trying to be helpful. Just say i would like to drive him on my days regardless if you are going to the same place or not. \n\nYTA for thinking parents shouldn\u2019t be able to watch kids sports when it\u2019s not on their day and for trying to control what a grown man does. You don\u2019t provide any problems BF is causing other than you don\u2019t like it.", "YTA. You\u2019re being ridiculous about this. You\u2019re just jealous that this man is bonding with your child and putting up silly barriers to try and prevent it. Nobody is \u2018interfering\u2019 with your time with your son. \n\nAnd like\u2026pretty sure he just volunteered to give your kid a ride to class because it was more convenient. Most people don\u2019t see driving a kid and dropping them off at a class as special time together. If you want to waste the fuel by both driving, go ahead, but no need to be paranoid and dramatic about it.", "YTA. You can't dictate whether or not another person attends an event that they were rightfully invited to just because your son will be there. Why don't you join the class, too? That way, you can have the same amount of time with your son that his mother's partner has? Just an idea.", "YTA\n\nYou sound insecure. Step dad can have a hobby the same as your son\u2019s and can be involved in your son\u2019s life.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here. I think, so far, NAH. \n\nI completely get what you are feeling AND I think you are focused in the wrong thing. Your ex is right, you can\u2019t demand that her bf miss his grading because you don\u2019t want to see him while your son grades. Besides it being a public place who does and does not grade when is up to the instructor. And focusing on what that caused a fight and got get back up so she\u2019s less likely to *hear* what you are really saying because you seem like you\u2019re being a Dick. \n\nHere\u2019s what you do. You apologize for asking for that, say you realize that it was selfish and also not what you really want. Then tell her, when BF took son to class it felt like him taking away your limited time with son and that your real concern isn\u2019t whether bf is *there* but the symptom that *because he\u2019s there anyway it\u2019s fine for him to step in in your time with your kid*. It\u2019s not. \n\nSo you\u2019d like to talk and make arrangements that when it is your time with son YOU will drive him to class. And while bf might engage with son during class as per his instructor all time out of class he will treat son like he does any other co-student and will allow you to have your parenting time. \n\nAs the grading is your time, you\u2019ll be taking him and they can congratulate him (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be allowed to attend gradings in their time and cheer him in so you need to return the same) but that you\u2019ll be taking him after etc. And you\u2019d like them to respect that this is your weekend and you just \u201chappen\u201d to be seeing each other. \n\nTHAT\u2019S what you really want. Don\u2019t fight about how you think it should happen, but hold out for what is actually important. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re willing to apologize and talk it out NAH, but if you\u2019re going to insist on it looking exactly your way then everyone else would be right.", "So just between you and all of us.. what is THIS really about? Can\u2019t be just about Tae Kwon Do.", "YTA.  It may be feelings of someone trying to take your place as dad.  That won't happen unless you continue this behavior and alienate your son.  It will happen, I've seen this situation before. You are co-parenting and she has moved on. You should be happy that she  is with someone that cares about your son and wants to be in his life as well.  Would you prefer she date a jerk that is cruel to your son?  The kid is lucky to have so many people caring about him.  Rather than complaining and having a pissing contest over this child how about compromise? Join the same class, and participate.  How cool would it be to have 2 important people join him.  Also, on your days say that even though the BF is going to dame class, you'd still like to take your son and see him practice. Maybe find another activity you and your son can do specifically together. Trying to do the \"it's my day you must avoid my son\" is immature and unrealistic. It's only a problem of you make it one. I bet if the rolls were reversed you would be pretty passed if your GF was not allowed to do things with your son.", "YTA - The only instance where you\u2019ve described something that could be overstepping was the day stepdad took your son to class on your day. I\u2019m not sure how that was even possible (why wasn\u2019t your son with you if it was your day)? You would have been justified in that instance to say you still wanted to be the one to drive him to class. But your request that he not attend the promotion is way out of line even if he wasn\u2019t in the class. You\u2019re also not a \u201csingle dad,\u201d you are a coparenting dad, start acting like it!", "Info: you do realize that the BF doesn\u2019t get to pick when he tests and that is probably when his session is, right? Also, why is it bad that he is trying to do something positive with your son? Are you threatened?", "YTA \n\nBf in the same gym and sharing activitiy with your son, get over it.\nThere are no \u201c boundaries as a parent \u201c which you can impose on others like that.", "YTA, this shit is petty af.

You cannot control everyone and everything in your son's life.", "Her BF isn't there to interfere. He's also a student.\n\nYTA", "Yta its his belt testing too. Why do you want your son to have *less* love in his life.  Ypu can either be the dad who co patents well and gets along with his kids (maybe) step dad or the dad who the kid has to walk on eggshells around bc God forbid he mention that step dad did something fun with him", "YTA. I would never tell my step kids dad he couldn't attend something like that nor would he pull that shit on me.  How incredibly insecure are you", "Info.  Your 5 year old is in the same class as a grown man?", "Yta. You sound bitter and childish.  It's not about you it's about your son. Grow up and get over it", "YTA. You can\u2019t dictate what interests your ex\u2019s bf has. He paid for his classes and this a testing event for the whole class. His teacher felt he was ready for the next level as is your son. Stop being a spoiled brat and get over yourself. Men really don\u2019t grow up, you sound like a possessive teenager, not a grown man, let alone a father.", "Soft YTA. It's totally normal to feel \"attacked\" by old spouse's new friend, but don't make the kid suffer for it. If somebody is decent and wants to contribute to your kid's life, let them.", "Info: is the class a mixed class? It's very irregular for adults to be practicising with children that young. Most martial arts will have junior classes, and separate adult classes.", "Out of all the places the stepfather could study, he picked the place where your son goes. And just coincidentally he goes at the same time as your son so he takes your son to practice during your time. Uh huh. He's trying to cut you out of your son's life and take your place. NTA", "I have to say NTA. Step dad takes a class at the same time at the same dojo as your son, coincidentally being able to drive him there as well, and impeding upon you limited time with your son? You have to clearly & calmly communicate to your ex & step dad that they are taking away your time with your son. Any time step dad spends in class with your son should be as co-students, not as step dad & step son. If this class takes place during your time with him then you should be the primary parent during this time. I don\u2019t think this was malicious, but it does need to be limited.", "YTA. Sadly. You\u2019re overthinking it at the expense of your son. You should make an effort to be nicer to her new bf since he seems to be good to your son even if he has their own baby now with your ex. And that\u2019s something to be grateful for . \nYour son needs more people that cares for him. He will probably be his stepfather in the future too. No one is taking your son from you it\u2019s all in your head. Why not try to have your son when it\u2019s not your schedule? Im pretty sure you\u2019re wife won\u2019t mind. Don\u2019t make it harder than it is for your son. He is 5 and knows more than you think", "YTA Maybe you shouldnt have split up your family if you dont want another dude raising your kid", "NAH.

You just have to suck it up and deal. He has a right to be there if he's a student in the class. He has a right to be there just from the parenting perspective, too. I've been where you are. Be an adult about it.", "They are overstepping on your time. Guess you could do the same though. Speaking as a step child many times over, please do not argue in front of your child (not saying you do). Its VERY stressful for them. These are the woes of split families. You should find something for just you and your son to do instead\n\nEdit: Nta for feeling like that", "NTA. This is an activity for your son that the boyfriend has now co-opted into a joint venture for hem.\n\nI understand your frustration. You get your son on your custody days. Period. Unless you agree to change.

You're going to have to deal with it since you don't have a problem with him going to the same school. If it means that much maybe try to get some extra time with your son another day.", "NTA for it, but you do need to get over it and possibly apologize for overeating. It does seem wrong him interfering with your time though,on the normal days, but I feel the belt promotion day should be exempt from that.", "Yta", "Your only option now is to join the class as well and defeat the new boyfriend in combat to prove yourself to your son.", "NTA.  the only thing you're asking is to have your designated time with your son.  but i have questions.  \n\nso both your son and your ex's bf are testing on the same day, how is that affecting your time with him?  are they expecting to have him that weekend?  is that the only day either of them can test?  i guess i don't understand how you can say you don't want him to be there if it's a testing day?  \n\ndon't get me wrong, i understand how you feel.  but it doesn't seem like you'd be sharing time with them just because you're going to be in the same room that day, or maybe i'm misunderstanding the situation.  i do think you're feeling like a boundary was overstepped when her bf decided to join the same tkd as your son, which is fair.  they shouldn't be taking him to practice on your days, especially since you are really making an effort to be an involved parent.", "NTA. \n\nI think it\u2019s great your ex\u2019s partner is making sure to do things with your son.

Maybe the partner can still join taekwondo, but you get an extra afternoon a week so you can just be with him ?\n\nBut also, if the mom was the one that joined, would you have been that upset too ?

Again me trying to cooperate said no problem, you guys do what you think is best on your days i trust you\n\nI'm not talking about taking him. I'm talking about the part where he said he didn't mind the bf joining the school as a student as well.", "Our TKD only does one belt testing for everyone in the school, from preschool to elderly.", "Yeah, my tkd dojang had under 12s and over 12s in separate classes, because half the class time is just corralling little kids and trying to get them to listen to you. That gets real tiring for anyone over a certain age for multiple reasons. It\u2019s also just easier and safer to have people who are more roughly the same size training together. (I say, when most the 12 year olds were already taller than me.)", "I got what you mean, that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s intervals. White belt to yellow 1 month to have students ready for testing and kids and adults test on that day. Though depending on the system little kids like 4-5 year olds learn different skills that aren\u2019t as intense and they test separately. But everyone else it\u2019s this day and that\u2019s it. Our system was white, yellow, orange, purple, blue, blue green stripe, green, green brown stripe, brown, brown black stripe, first degree brown, second degree brown, black, first degree black, second degree, third, fourth is master and highest is 12th degree black and that\u2019s professor and there\u2019s only 1 professor in our system. Yep same with us, if your sensi didn\u2019t feel you were you had to wait till the next month testing letters being sent out.", "It seems like they accepted that without argument though."]}
