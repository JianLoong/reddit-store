This event isn't about you it's about celebrating your son and everyone else who is paying for the class. (I think it's weird the school is mixing ages like that within a single class, but that's sort of beside the point here).\n\nWho are you to tell another student they have to miss their promotion just because you're too insecure to see your ex's new partner getting along with your son? If anything, you should be grateful that she's found someone who cares about and supports your son instead of all of the crappy stories we see on here with partners treating kids like garbage.", "YTA. This is a belt promotion ceremony for anyone in the class. The boyfriend is in the class, it\u2019s a public space, you have no right to insist he doesn\u2019t attend. Get over it", "YTA.\n\nStop competing with your ex's bf.  He apparently is now in your son's life and you had better find a way to co-parent nicely.  Your son will greatly benefit from a cooperative relationship.  If you don't, your son will figure it out and your relationship with him will go south.\n\nAnd the more people that love your son, the better for him.  Your son isn't choosing between you and your ex's bf.  There is room for both of you in his life.", "INFO: how does testing work at this school?  At the studio my kid and I took lessons, testing days were on a set schedule, and everyone tested at the same time.  So if you don't want BF testing at the same time as son, that would be saying he can't test at all, and would make you an AH.  Same question re classes.  Our studio has two all ages classes a week so that parents and kids, or different age siblings can go together, but most are age segregated.  \n\nHave you considered taking classes yourself?  Then you could do these things with your son and not just watch.", "YTA - The man can go wherever he wants.", "YTA. You are making this a big deal when it's not.", "YTA. You can\u2019t tell him not to use the gym your kid is at. Not to mention, even if he wasn\u2019t literally taking the class, I think they should have been allowed to come to see him get promoted to yellow if it\u2019s something important to your son. If he gets into tournaments would you expect only the parent with custody that day gets to go?\n\n\nYou are being unreasonable. YTA", "You are N T A for wanting to drive him on your days. But it\u2019s possible the BF was trying to be helpful. Just say i would like to drive him on my days regardless if you are going to the same place or not. \n\nYTA for thinking parents shouldn\u2019t be able to watch kids sports when it\u2019s not on their day and for trying to control what a grown man does. You don\u2019t provide any problems BF is causing other than you don\u2019t like it.", "YTA. You\u2019re being ridiculous about this. You\u2019re just jealous that this man is bonding with your child and putting up silly barriers to try and prevent it. Nobody is \u2018interfering\u2019 with your time with your son. \n\nAnd like\u2026pretty sure he just volunteered to give your kid a ride to class because it was more convenient. Most people don\u2019t see driving a kid and dropping them off at a class as special time together. If you want to waste the fuel by both driving, go ahead, but no need to be paranoid and dramatic about it.", "YTA. You can't dictate whether or not another person attends an event that they were rightfully invited to just because your son will be there. Why don't you join the class, too? That way, you can have the same amount of time with your son that his mother's partner has? Just an idea.", "YTA\n\nYou sound insecure. Step dad can have a hobby the same as your son\u2019s and can be involved in your son\u2019s life.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here. I think, so far, NAH. \n\nI completely get what you are feeling AND I think you are focused in the wrong thing. Your ex is right, you can\u2019t demand that her bf miss his grading because you don\u2019t want to see him while your son grades. Besides it being a public place who does and does not grade when is up to the instructor. And focusing on what that caused a fight and got get back up so she\u2019s less likely to *hear* what you are really saying because you seem like you\u2019re being a Dick. \n\nHere\u2019s what you do. You apologize for asking for that, say you realize that it was selfish and also not what you really want. Then tell her, when BF took son to class it felt like him taking away your limited time with son and that your real concern isn\u2019t whether bf is *there* but the symptom that *because he\u2019s there anyway it\u2019s fine for him to step in in your time with your kid*. It\u2019s not. \n\nSo you\u2019d like to talk and make arrangements that when it is your time with son YOU will drive him to class. And while bf might engage with son during class as per his instructor all time out of class he will treat son like he does any other co-student and will allow you to have your parenting time. \n\nAs the grading is your time, you\u2019ll be taking him and they can congratulate him (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be allowed to attend gradings in their time and cheer him in so you need to return the same) but that you\u2019ll be taking him after etc. And you\u2019d like them to respect that this is your weekend and you just \u201chappen\u201d to be seeing each other. \n\nTHAT\u2019S what you really want. Don\u2019t fight about how you think it should happen, but hold out for what is actually important. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re willing to apologize and talk it out NAH, but if you\u2019re going to insist on it looking exactly your way then everyone else would be right.", "So just between you and all of us.. what is THIS really about? Can\u2019t be just about Tae Kwon Do.", "YTA.  It may be feelings of someone trying to take your place as dad.  That won't happen unless you continue this behavior and alienate your son.  It will happen, I've seen this situation before. You are co-parenting and she has moved on. You should be happy that she  is with someone that cares about your son and wants to be in his life as well.  Would you prefer she date a jerk that is cruel to your son?  The kid is lucky to have so many people caring about him.  Rather than complaining and having a pissing contest over this child how about compromise? Join the same class, and participate.  How cool would it be to have 2 important people join him.  Also, on your days say that even though the BF is going to dame class, you'd still like to take your son and see him practice. Maybe find another activity you and your son can do specifically together. Trying to do the \"it's my day you must avoid my son\" is immature and unrealistic. It's only a problem of you make it one. I bet if the rolls were reversed you would be pretty passed if your GF was not allowed to do things with your son.", "YTA - The only instance where you\u2019ve described something that could be overstepping was the day stepdad took your son to class on your day. I\u2019m not sure how that was even possible (why wasn\u2019t your son with you if it was your day)? You would have been justified in that instance to say you still wanted to be the one to drive him to class. But your request that he not attend the promotion is way out of line even if he wasn\u2019t in the class. You\u2019re also not a \u201csingle dad,\u201d you are a coparenting dad, start acting like it!", "Info: you do realize that the BF doesn\u2019t get to pick when he tests and that is probably when his session is, right? Also, why is it bad that he is trying to do something positive with your son? Are you threatened?", "YTA \n\nBf in the same gym and sharing activitiy with your son, get over it.\nThere are no \u201c boundaries as a parent \u201c which you can impose on others like that.", "YTA, this shit is petty af.

You cannot control everyone and everything in your son's life.", "Her BF isn't there to interfere. He's also a student.\n\nYTA", "Yta its his belt testing too. Why do you want your son to have *less* love in his life.  Ypu can either be the dad who co patents well and gets along with his kids (maybe) step dad or the dad who the kid has to walk on eggshells around bc God forbid he mention that step dad did something fun with him", "YTA. I would never tell my step kids dad he couldn't attend something like that nor would he pull that shit on me.  How incredibly insecure are you", "Info.  Your 5 year old is in the same class as a grown man?", "Yta. You sound bitter and childish.  It's not about you it's about your son. Grow up and get over it", "YTA. You can\u2019t dictate what interests your ex\u2019s bf has. He paid for his classes and this a testing event for the whole class. His teacher felt he was ready for the next level as is your son. Stop being a spoiled brat and get over yourself. Men really don\u2019t grow up, you sound like a possessive teenager, not a grown man, let alone a father.", "Soft YTA. It's totally normal to feel \"attacked\" by old spouse's new friend, but don't make the kid suffer for it. If somebody is decent and wants to contribute to your kid's life, let them.", "Info: is the class a mixed class? It's very irregular for adults to be practicising with children that young. Most martial arts will have junior classes, and separate adult classes.", "Out of all the places the stepfather could study, he picked the place where your son goes. And just coincidentally he goes at the same time as your son so he takes your son to practice during your time. Uh huh. He's trying to cut you out of your son's life and take your place. NTA", "I have to say NTA. Step dad takes a class at the same time at the same dojo as your son, coincidentally being able to drive him there as well, and impeding upon you limited time with your son? You have to clearly & calmly communicate to your ex & step dad that they are taking away your time with your son. Any time step dad spends in class with your son should be as co-students, not as step dad & step son. If this class takes place during your time with him then you should be the primary parent during this time. I don\u2019t think this was malicious, but it does need to be limited.", "YTA. Sadly. You\u2019re overthinking it at the expense of your son. You should make an effort to be nicer to her new bf since he seems to be good to your son even if he has their own baby now with your ex. And that\u2019s something to be grateful for . \nYour son needs more people that cares for him. He will probably be his stepfather in the future too. No one is taking your son from you it\u2019s all in your head. Why not try to have your son when it\u2019s not your schedule? Im pretty sure you\u2019re wife won\u2019t mind. Don\u2019t make it harder than it is for your son. He is 5 and knows more than you think", "YTA Maybe you shouldnt have split up your family if you dont want another dude raising your kid", "NAH.

You just have to suck it up and deal. He has a right to be there if he's a student in the class. He has a right to be there just from the parenting perspective, too. I've been where you are. Be an adult about it.", "They are overstepping on your time. Guess you could do the same though. Speaking as a step child many times over, please do not argue in front of your child (not saying you do). Its VERY stressful for them. These are the woes of split families. You should find something for just you and your son to do instead\n\nEdit: Nta for feeling like that", "NTA. This is an activity for your son that the boyfriend has now co-opted into a joint venture for hem.\n\nI understand your frustration. You get your son on your custody days. Period. Unless you agree to change.

You're going to have to deal with it since you don't have a problem with him going to the same school. If it means that much maybe try to get some extra time with your son another day.", "NTA for it, but you do need to get over it and possibly apologize for overeating. It does seem wrong him interfering with your time though,on the normal days, but I feel the belt promotion day should be exempt from that.", "Yta", "Your only option now is to join the class as well and defeat the new boyfriend in combat to prove yourself to your son.", "NTA.  the only thing you're asking is to have your designated time with your son.  but i have questions.  \n\nso both your son and your ex's bf are testing on the same day, how is that affecting your time with him?  are they expecting to have him that weekend?  is that the only day either of them can test?  i guess i don't understand how you can say you don't want him to be there if it's a testing day?  \n\ndon't get me wrong, i understand how you feel.  but it doesn't seem like you'd be sharing time with them just because you're going to be in the same room that day, or maybe i'm misunderstanding the situation.  i do think you're feeling like a boundary was overstepped when her bf decided to join the same tkd as your son, which is fair.  they shouldn't be taking him to practice on your days, especially since you are really making an effort to be an involved parent.", "NTA. \n\nI think it\u2019s great your ex\u2019s partner is making sure to do things with your son.

Maybe the partner can still join taekwondo, but you get an extra afternoon a week so you can just be with him ?\n\nBut also, if the mom was the one that joined, would you have been that upset too ?

I do understand the issue with your time with your son being taken over though but only if that's outside of the dojang.\n\nIn the dojang they're practicing together because that's just how it seems to be structured. That doesn't have anything to do with the custody agreement.\n\nI think you should try to work out a schedule or something if it's that big of a deal, or maybe be more active in your son's hobby. At least at my dojang, the younger kids can have parents volunteer to hold boards or targets when they're practicing, and if the one your son attends does the same kind of thing maybe you could ask the instructor about helping with that if you want to be involved with that if spending time with your son is the issue.\n\nAlso. Making your kid choose between you and your ex's bf will only cause issues for your son, and possibly strain between your relationship with him later on if he gets along with the bf. I know at least for me, I don't get along with my mom because it was always choosing between her and my dad, and later on I just cut contact because it was a constant competition. \n\nIt's not healthy for anyone to fight over a kid so OP, you need to learn to compromise. \n\nAnyway. Unrelated, but congrats to your son on the belt promotion. Also what style is the dojang teaching? Is it WT, ITF or ATA? Or is it a different one? I just get curious when TDK is brought up what styles other people learn.", "Yta and obviously total morgon here.

It makes sense that you feel this way I just think you're letting your emotions get in the way of realizing your kid is gonna remember how you acted not how you felt, and I can tell you care about your kid.

Remember that eventually you will start dating and would you like your ex banning your partner from events just because she is insecure and doesn't want her there and it happens to be on her time? Because that can happen very easily. You need to learn to coparent together. You are going to ruin it by being jealous and insecure. The guy isn't doing anything wrong going to the same gym, belt testing at the same time or showing up to support your kid. You can carve out activities that are yours exclusively but things like sports and school events are shared by all the adults in his life. They can't schedule those to be a second equal events on both times and your son deserves having parents who can tolerate each other long enough to show up and support him on whatever program no matter whose time it is. Don't make your kid miss out on having only you or only Mom/boyfriend at his events or have to choose who he wants there. Don't make him a pawn. Do better. Be the bigger person.

If, and only if, stepdad really has an interest in learn tae kwon do, then stepdad has a right to have his test day on the same day as son.  But dad is reasonable in worrying that that the sudden interest in tae kwon do is a pretense to alienate him from his son, ESPECIALLY after usurping on his custody day without discussing it.

Your agreed upon time with your son is just that, and your ex and her bf need to honor that.", "You love your son, and want to be an important part of his life. Fathers are vital. \n\nI get the impression that you feel like you are giving up time alone with your son. The Daddy and Me thing is now Daddy and me and Bonus Daddy time.

I get it. You have a right to feel this way. Since good relations are important, bf should have immediately reschedule his martial arts classes to avoid when you just wanted to have Daddy and Me time. \n\nNow for my advice. Begin as you mean to go on. This is going to happen all the time in a blended family. There will also be times when you might be asked to bring his half sibling along. Or maybe you\u2019ll get married and the roles will reverse.\n\nMy question is, do you feel like this guy is deliberately trying to intrude on your quality time with your son? Or does he just like taekwondo and decided it was easier to train at the same dojo? Is he trying to replace you, or is this just a blended family?\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t get any manipulative feeling about him, then I suggest accepting the blended family approach, where you all can attend family events together, and everyone gets along without being a doormat.\n\nCarve out time to do fun things with your boy. Make traditions, like calling him every night and asking what his favorite thing about his day was. Form the relationship now that he can talk to you if something bothers you. For instance, you can tell him you had such a frustrating day, because X Y Z happened, but then you went for a run and relaxed, or solved it by ABC. Build the memories and the relationship.\n\nYour boy has only one Dad. If bf is good to him, then you\u2019re very lucky. It could be so much worse. As nice as he can be, bf can never replace you as Dad. Be confident and secure in that. Do not make your son feel guilty for liking Mom\u2019s bf, or for bf doing taekwondo. Your bf will always have a familial tie to your son, now, because he\u2019s the father of your son\u2019s half sibling. \n\nAlso, as your child gets older, he\u2019s going to need you even more. If bf and your ex remain together, your son is going to spend some time with you, and sometime with Mom, while his half sibling(s) have a nuclear family. You might get remarried and start a new family. That can be a unique difficulty for some kids where they don\u2019t feel like they belong anywhere. Keep this in mind and ensure your son knows he\u2019s treasured.\n\nYour really trying hard to be there for your kid, and to get along with your ex.

Your son is 5 years old and still developing his parental bonds.  If the BF is specifically trying to use your time, with your son, as his time to bond with your child...he's overstepping boundaries.   Don't let these other folks call you insecure or whatever.  Trust your gut.  Your feelings are justified unless you want your boy to start calling a random man daddy.\n\n\n AND let's be real.\n\n If the boyfriend wants to train in martial arts SERIOUSLY...he would be training with other adults...not with kids.  Why?  The intensity level is different.  The concentration, discipline and comprehension skills between a group of children and adults are different.  Sparring, defensive techniques are only practical vs practicioners of similar sizes.  I'm not going to have a 6 year old throw a punch at an adult or vice versa because there is no training value in it for the adult.  We also train children differently due to how their bodies are still in development vs how we'd train an adult.  And little kids have a very short attention span and behave like little kids. There's no practical reason for an adult to join a class with children if he seriously wants to learn self defense or martial arts.\n\nThe only time parents train with kids in a tkd class is to bond with the child and have a shared activity.  I've taught and trained both adults and children in TKD, Hapkido and Karate.  Usually forms, Kata or poomsae practice is the only time cross training those age groups is effective.  So why would bf be taking this course with your son?  It's not to become great at martial arts.  It's to bond with your son.  If you feel that sort of bonding is inappropriate or too much for a guy who is your ex's baby daddy , you have the right as a father to say \"no...I don't like the relationship you are trying to foster with my 5 year old child.\"  The bf isn't your ex's husband and he ain't your son's daddy.   He needs to back off, respect your boundaries as the child's father, and your ex needs to stop cosigning this behavior on his part.", "I'm gonna say a light YTA, I get your feelings, I think they are normal, but that doesn't mean you have the right to tell him he can't attend the class.

She seems to be very reasonable, and have chosen a new partner who seems very reasonable too\u2026 maybe my question for you would be have you considered taking the class also?

It's not that unexpected that eventually, BF will be offering to take son HOME too. After all, if they leave class late - stay talking in the parking lot even for a few minutes- suddenly, what IS the point of that drive with Dad, when BF is going to the same house as his step-son just forty minutes/an hour or two earlier... \n\nNow Dad - who may have every other weekend and Wednesdays - and class is on Wednesdays.... Suddenly just has his son every other weekend.

Dad meeting them there and watching the class.... And then Dad leaving to go home alone and son riding home with his StepDad again. That's a far cry different from spending 3pm-9pm with his dad every Wednesday afternoon. \n\nAnd then, once THAT'S happened... Just think about how many tournaments and events are going to fall on weekends.

I still come watch him take classes and support him- but instead of Wednesday (class day) being my weekday afternoon... How about my weekday afternoon becomes Tues/Thurs? \n\nHell, dad has the opportunity to get himself LESS wasted gas - LET step dad take him to and from class...

Step parents should be involved in their kids' lives. If the kid didn't like this then that would be a different story but there's nothing in the post that indicates that.", "This.

He had such a great time with his step dad that he want to continue the day with him ? How is it fair for the bio dad which only wanted to share special time with his son. The step dad clearly did this to strengthen his bond with the child, but it's detrimental for the bio dad", "What makes you think the kid wanted that guy in his class, maybe it was an escape for him from home life, since kids have few. Then the damn weirdo joins his class. Gross.", "I think the other guy is reaching calling it creepy but it\u2019s a little rude. All for having a positive relationship with your step kids but trying to be overly paternal when he already has a father is an overstep IMO", "I highly doubt a young child would feel comfortable expressing that he didn\u2019t want him in the class.

He shoulda thought about that before he had a child. The son deserves to have BOTH of his parents support. If he's only willing to show up for his kid when it's \"his day\" then he's a shitty parent. Op is under no obligation to interact with stepdad, he is however obligated to support his son. He needs to pull his head out of his ass and stop acting butthurt towards the ex and bf, for his son's benefit. \n\nAgain, does op just expect his son's mom and stepdad to miss any important events that occur on his days? Will he get his feelwings hurt if he has to exist in the same room as them \ud83e\udd7a.

If there's a once a year event is one parent just expected to not show up? What if it's one time only? Is op really going to let his pettiness towards his ex get in the way of him supporting his child in his major life events? When his son graduates will op not show because it's not his day \ud83e\udd37. What if the ex's parents want to come watch their grandson's taekwondo ceremony but it's op's day? Will he get all pissy in that case too? \n\n\n>You don't know anything about taekwondo if you think adults and kids can't be partners \n\nYou're right, I don't.
