This event isn't about you it's about celebrating your son and everyone else who is paying for the class. (I think it's weird the school is mixing ages like that within a single class, but that's sort of beside the point here).\n\nWho are you to tell another student they have to miss their promotion just because you're too insecure to see your ex's new partner getting along with your son? If anything, you should be grateful that she's found someone who cares about and supports your son instead of all of the crappy stories we see on here with partners treating kids like garbage.", "YTA. This is a belt promotion ceremony for anyone in the class. The boyfriend is in the class, it\u2019s a public space, you have no right to insist he doesn\u2019t attend. Get over it", "YTA.\n\nStop competing with your ex's bf.  He apparently is now in your son's life and you had better find a way to co-parent nicely.  Your son will greatly benefit from a cooperative relationship.  If you don't, your son will figure it out and your relationship with him will go south.\n\nAnd the more people that love your son, the better for him.  Your son isn't choosing between you and your ex's bf.  There is room for both of you in his life.", "INFO: how does testing work at this school?  At the studio my kid and I took lessons, testing days were on a set schedule, and everyone tested at the same time.  So if you don't want BF testing at the same time as son, that would be saying he can't test at all, and would make you an AH.  Same question re classes.  Our studio has two all ages classes a week so that parents and kids, or different age siblings can go together, but most are age segregated.  \n\nHave you considered taking classes yourself?  Then you could do these things with your son and not just watch.", "YTA - The man can go wherever he wants.", "YTA. You are making this a big deal when it's not.", "YTA. You can\u2019t tell him not to use the gym your kid is at. Not to mention, even if he wasn\u2019t literally taking the class, I think they should have been allowed to come to see him get promoted to yellow if it\u2019s something important to your son. If he gets into tournaments would you expect only the parent with custody that day gets to go?\n\n\nYou are being unreasonable. YTA", "You are N T A for wanting to drive him on your days.

Just say i would like to drive him on my days regardless if you are going to the same place or not. \n\nYTA for thinking parents shouldn\u2019t be able to watch kids sports when it\u2019s not on their day and for trying to control what a grown man does. You don\u2019t provide any problems BF is causing other than you don\u2019t like it.", "YTA. You\u2019re being ridiculous about this. You\u2019re just jealous that this man is bonding with your child and putting up silly barriers to try and prevent it. Nobody is \u2018interfering\u2019 with your time with your son. \n\nAnd like\u2026pretty sure he just volunteered to give your kid a ride to class because it was more convenient. Most people don\u2019t see driving a kid and dropping them off at a class as special time together. If you want to waste the fuel by both driving, go ahead, but no need to be paranoid and dramatic about it.", "YTA. You can't dictate whether or not another person attends an event that they were rightfully invited to just because your son will be there. Why don't you join the class, too? That way, you can have the same amount of time with your son that his mother's partner has? Just an idea.", "YTA\n\nYou sound insecure. Step dad can have a hobby the same as your son\u2019s and can be involved in your son\u2019s life.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here. I think, so far, NAH. \n\nI completely get what you are feeling AND I think you are focused in the wrong thing. Your ex is right, you can\u2019t demand that her bf miss his grading because you don\u2019t want to see him while your son grades. Besides it being a public place who does and does not grade when is up to the instructor. And focusing on what that caused a fight and got get back up so she\u2019s less likely to *hear* what you are really saying because you seem like you\u2019re being a Dick. \n\nHere\u2019s what you do. You apologize for asking for that, say you realize that it was selfish and also not what you really want. Then tell her, when BF took son to class it felt like him taking away your limited time with son and that your real concern isn\u2019t whether bf is *there* but the symptom that *because he\u2019s there anyway it\u2019s fine for him to step in in your time with your kid*. It\u2019s not. \n\nSo you\u2019d like to talk and make arrangements that when it is your time with son YOU will drive him to class. And while bf might engage with son during class as per his instructor all time out of class he will treat son like he does any other co-student and will allow you to have your parenting time. \n\nAs the grading is your time, you\u2019ll be taking him and they can congratulate him (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be allowed to attend gradings in their time and cheer him in so you need to return the same) but that you\u2019ll be taking him after etc. And you\u2019d like them to respect that this is your weekend and you just \u201chappen\u201d to be seeing each other. \n\nTHAT\u2019S what you really want. Don\u2019t fight about how you think it should happen, but hold out for what is actually important. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re willing to apologize and talk it out NAH, but if you\u2019re going to insist on it looking exactly your way then everyone else would be right.", "So just between you and all of us.. what is THIS really about? Can\u2019t be just about Tae Kwon Do.", "YTA.  It may be feelings of someone trying to take your place as dad.  That won't happen unless you continue this behavior and alienate your son.  It will happen, I've seen this situation before. You are co-parenting and she has moved on. You should be happy that she  is with someone that cares about your son and wants to be in his life as well.  Would you prefer she date a jerk that is cruel to your son?  The kid is lucky to have so many people caring about him.  Rather than complaining and having a pissing contest over this child how about compromise? Join the same class, and participate.  How cool would it be to have 2 important people join him.  Also, on your days say that even though the BF is going to dame class, you'd still like to take your son and see him practice. Maybe find another activity you and your son can do specifically together. Trying to do the \"it's my day you must avoid my son\" is immature and unrealistic. It's only a problem of you make it one. I bet if the rolls were reversed you would be pretty passed if your GF was not allowed to do things with your son.", "YTA - The only instance where you\u2019ve described something that could be overstepping was the day stepdad took your son to class on your day. I\u2019m not sure how that was even possible (why wasn\u2019t your son with you if it was your day)? You would have been justified in that instance to say you still wanted to be the one to drive him to class. But your request that he not attend the promotion is way out of line even if he wasn\u2019t in the class. You\u2019re also not a \u201csingle dad,\u201d you are a coparenting dad, start acting like it!", "Info: you do realize that the BF doesn\u2019t get to pick when he tests and that is probably when his session is, right? Also, why is it bad that he is trying to do something positive with your son? Are you threatened?", "YTA \n\nBf in the same gym and sharing activitiy with your son, get over it.\nThere are no \u201c boundaries as a parent \u201c which you can impose on others like that.", "YTA, this shit is petty af.

You cannot control everyone and everything in your son's life.", "Her BF isn't there to interfere. He's also a student.\n\nYTA", "Yta its his belt testing too. Why do you want your son to have *less* love in his life.  Ypu can either be the dad who co patents well and gets along with his kids (maybe) step dad or the dad who the kid has to walk on eggshells around bc God forbid he mention that step dad did something fun with him", "YTA. I would never tell my step kids dad he couldn't attend something like that nor would he pull that shit on me.  How incredibly insecure are you", "Info.  Your 5 year old is in the same class as a grown man?", "Yta. You sound bitter and childish.  It's not about you it's about your son. Grow up and get over it", "YTA. You can\u2019t dictate what interests your ex\u2019s bf has. He paid for his classes and this a testing event for the whole class. His teacher felt he was ready for the next level as is your son. Stop being a spoiled brat and get over yourself. Men really don\u2019t grow up, you sound like a possessive teenager, not a grown man, let alone a father.", "Soft YTA. It's totally normal to feel \"attacked\" by old spouse's new friend, but don't make the kid suffer for it. If somebody is decent and wants to contribute to your kid's life, let them.", "Info: is the class a mixed class? It's very irregular for adults to be practicising with children that young. Most martial arts will have junior classes, and separate adult classes.", "Out of all the places the stepfather could study, he picked the place where your son goes. And just coincidentally he goes at the same time as your son so he takes your son to practice during your time. Uh huh. He's trying to cut you out of your son's life and take your place. NTA", "I have to say NTA. Step dad takes a class at the same time at the same dojo as your son, coincidentally being able to drive him there as well, and impeding upon you limited time with your son? You have to clearly & calmly communicate to your ex & step dad that they are taking away your time with your son. Any time step dad spends in class with your son should be as co-students, not as step dad & step son. If this class takes place during your time with him then you should be the primary parent during this time. I don\u2019t think this was malicious, but it does need to be limited.", "YTA. Sadly. You\u2019re overthinking it at the expense of your son. You should make an effort to be nicer to her new bf since he seems to be good to your son even if he has their own baby now with your ex. And that\u2019s something to be grateful for . \nYour son needs more people that cares for him. He will probably be his stepfather in the future too. No one is taking your son from you it\u2019s all in your head. Why not try to have your son when it\u2019s not your schedule? Im pretty sure you\u2019re wife won\u2019t mind. Don\u2019t make it harder than it is for your son. He is 5 and knows more than you think", "YTA Maybe you shouldnt have split up your family if you dont want another dude raising your kid", "NAH.

You just have to suck it up and deal. He has a right to be there if he's a student in the class. He has a right to be there just from the parenting perspective, too. I've been where you are. Be an adult about it.", "They are overstepping on your time. Guess you could do the same though. Speaking as a step child many times over, please do not argue in front of your child (not saying you do). Its VERY stressful for them. These are the woes of split families. You should find something for just you and your son to do instead\n\nEdit: Nta for feeling like that", "NTA. This is an activity for your son that the boyfriend has now co-opted into a joint venture for hem.\n\nI understand your frustration. You get your son on your custody days. Period.

You're going to have to deal with it since you don't have a problem with him going to the same school. If it means that much maybe try to get some extra time with your son another day.", "NTA for it, but you do need to get over it and possibly apologize for overeating. It does seem wrong him interfering with your time though,on the normal days, but I feel the belt promotion day should be exempt from that.", "Yta", "Your only option now is to join the class as well and defeat the new boyfriend in combat to prove yourself to your son.", "NTA.  the only thing you're asking is to have your designated time with your son.  but i have questions.  \n\nso both your son and your ex's bf are testing on the same day, how is that affecting your time with him?  are they expecting to have him that weekend?  is that the only day either of them can test?  i guess i don't understand how you can say you don't want him to be there if it's a testing day?  \n\ndon't get me wrong, i understand how you feel.  but it doesn't seem like you'd be sharing time with them just because you're going to be in the same room that day, or maybe i'm misunderstanding the situation.  i do think you're feeling like a boundary was overstepped when her bf decided to join the same tkd as your son, which is fair.  they shouldn't be taking him to practice on your days, especially since you are really making an effort to be an involved parent.", "NTA. \n\nI think it\u2019s great your ex\u2019s partner is making sure to do things with your son.

Maybe the partner can still join taekwondo, but you get an extra afternoon a week so you can just be with him ?\n\nBut also, if the mom was the one that joined, would you have been that upset too ?

There will be things you get to share with your son alone, but in reality, it is not a bad thing he also has a stepdad that loves and cares for him too.  It stings, I know, but this is the reality of life when you are no longer with the person you brought this child into the world with.  I'm going with a very soft and understanding YTA right now.  But if you can't learn to share these moments, you're going to be the lone AH.  Don't punish your son because you and his mother couldn't make it work.

It could be the bf's way of making a connection with your son. My understanding of martial arts belt testing is based on a very small town environment, but the students were assigned certain times according to what belt they were testing for, i.e., all the ones testing for yellow belt had to be there at 10:30-11:00, so bf may not have the option of testing at a different time. \n\nI understand your feelings of having your time as a father intruded on by the presence of the bf, and I would probably feel the same way if I were in a similar situation with my kids.", "There is another (sounds like) positive step parent in your child's life.

He tells you and then says \"I'm going to go tell mom/BF!!!\" Or he asks BF for something to eat but not you. Or he runs and hugs mom before you. How do you react? \n\nThere are only so many situations where you and mom+BF won't be around each other with your son, especially as he gets older.

Though the fact that BF joined that one tells me they're either isn't another one right nearby or he did it for convenience because your kid was there.

You're creating tension where there really doesn't need to be any. As single parents, sometimes our feelings get hurt and we just have to be the grownups we are, smile and make it happen for our kids anyway. This is one of those times.

I see a whole lot about you, you, you and what you want. What does your son want?", "It sounds like he and your ex are slowly creeping into your time with your son.

You\u2019re not entitled to never encounter the new bf when you are with your kid.\n\nIt\u2019s legitimate that you feel intruded on and territorial, that\u2019s a natural response, but it\u2019s your problem to deal with, not the boyfriends problem to drop a hobby for you.", "To be honest, I get where you're coming from since it's hard to adjust to having to split time with your son like this. In all honesty, as long as the guy isn't a jerk, then I don't see why there's an issue so unfortunately I'd say YTA. I do understand the issue with your time with your son being taken over though but only if that's outside of the dojang.\n\nIn the dojang they're practicing together because that's just how it seems to be structured. That doesn't have anything to do with the custody agreement.\n\nI think you should try to work out a schedule or something if it's that big of a deal, or maybe be more active in your son's hobby. At least at my dojang, the younger kids can have parents volunteer to hold boards or targets when they're practicing, and if the one your son attends does the same kind of thing maybe you could ask the instructor about helping with that if you want to be involved with that if spending time with your son is the issue.\n\nAlso. Making your kid choose between you and your ex's bf will only cause issues for your son, and possibly strain between your relationship with him later on if he gets along with the bf. I know at least for me, I don't get along with my mom because it was always choosing between her and my dad, and later on I just cut contact because it was a constant competition. \n\nIt's not healthy for anyone to fight over a kid so OP, you need to learn to compromise. \n\nAnyway. Unrelated, but congrats to your son on the belt promotion. Also what style is the dojang teaching? Is it WT, ITF or ATA? Or is it a different one? I just get curious when TDK is brought up what styles other people learn.", "Yta and obviously total morgon here. The step dad starts to practise the same thing as your son, obviously to develop strongt connection to your son. Instead of getting inspired of steps you can take to have same development you see your son as a posession.\n\nSorry but you are so wrong here that i couldn't contain myself from calling you something.", "YTA and for what? The bf has every right to start whatever hobby he wants, and if that includes the same one as your son at the same academy then so be it.\n\nI gotta admit, at first I thought your ex was actually gonna use him to take custody away, but it turns out you\u2019re just competitive for all the wrong reasons. Your child\u2019s feelings should be put above yours in all of this anyway.", "YTA. Not the hill to die on. Very cool the boyfriend wants to the class and neat he can be there and take him.

And you know what happened at the exact same time? My dad was still my favorite person, and an awesome dad. Both things can happen at the same time, but I promise you that I wouldn't have had the same experience if one had tried gatekeeping the other. I would have lost respect for them as I got older.

Don't downvote me, lol. \n\nI think the thing that stands out for me is that OP now can't make memories of his son learning martial arts with out his step dad being apart of every memory.

I think you're in the wrong here and should probably apologize to your ex's bf, or like smooth things over somehow if you don't wanna. It makes sense that you feel this way I just think you're letting your emotions get in the way of realizing your kid is gonna remember how you acted not how you felt, and I can tell you care about your kid. It's not a bad thing that your kid has multiple parental figures, in fact a diverse array of role models is good!

Remember that eventually you will start dating and would you like your ex banning your partner from events just because she is insecure and doesn't want her there and it happens to be on her time? Because that can happen very easily. You need to learn to coparent together. You are going to ruin it by being jealous and insecure. The guy isn't doing anything wrong going to the same gym, belt testing at the same time or showing up to support your kid. You can carve out activities that are yours exclusively but things like sports and school events are shared by all the adults in his life. They can't schedule those to be a second equal events on both times and your son deserves having parents who can tolerate each other long enough to show up and support him on whatever program no matter whose time it is. Don't make your kid miss out on having only you or only Mom/boyfriend at his events or have to choose who he wants there. Don't make him a pawn. Do better. Be the bigger person.

It also meant when it was \u201chis time,\u201d we couldn\u2019t go over to friends houses or do anything on weekends because he was determined to have equal time. You start becoming a possession used to argue over custody schedules, and it\u2019s absolutely miserable. What happens when OPs son is like \u201cdad, can I ride to class with my tae kwon do friend?\u201d He\u2019s going to feel slighted and like that he owns that time frame of his son, and won\u2019t care what his son actually wants.", "I was thinking exactly this - don\u2019t make a scene over the Tae Kwon Do grading because that\u2019s just daft - but I think there are underlying issues with the ex and her new partner playing happy family and perhaps trying to sideline OP? Which isn\u2019t very fair if he\u2019s genuinely a good dad. Difficult to tell from this snippet but I definitely get the impression there\u2019s more to the story.", "A lot of people are missing this.  Stepdad is violating the custody agreement by taking son to class on dad's day.  He's doing it openly and notoriously by telling dad he can go fly a kite when dad objected to having his custody day taken away.  Dad is reasonable in worrying stepdad joining the class is a pretense to reduce his custody time.  If, and only if, stepdad really has an interest in learn tae kwon do, then stepdad has a right to have his test day on the same day as son.  But dad is reasonable in worrying that that the sudden interest in tae kwon do is a pretense to alienate him from his son, ESPECIALLY after usurping on his custody day without discussing it.  There was a trust violation and things are sometimes what they appear, especially with a kid that young.  If stepdad can force dad out of the picture, son will barely remember dad.", "It's a boyfriend not a husband. I've had work boots for longer than 2 years. You don't find it odd he chose the same gym? Sure have a hobby but I'd suspect there is more at play here.  Guy has a thing with his kid and now the couple has pretty much taken it over.", "Yeah, it\u2019s pretty freakin weird a grown man decided to join a class the kid was taking. He wasn\u2019t into it before, but decided to do it. Invasive at best, manipulative at worst. And just weirds me out.", "He just decided to do tae Kwon do at the same studio with her son\u2026. A little invasive. Like get another hobby or studio. Not like he did it before. He\u2019s following the lead of a child\u2019s activity?", "Yeah, he literally joined the kid\u2019s class. Creepy if you ask me.", "Bf is impeding on custody time, and needs to stop taking son to classes on dads days or will have to go back to court.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Bf and son still are gonna bond over learning arts together. As a TKD parent... kids tend to LOVE bonding with their grown ups by training together (that's how i got roped into joining as did 3 friends - our kids BEGGED).  Op could totally join and make it a guys' night thing where all 3 get to train together and op can stop being pissy that bf is prioritizing a fun way to bond vs prioritizing being a sports parent. I bet son would love it if he had 2 adults on the mat with him.", "No it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t note if you\u2019ve ever been to martial arts lessons, but they don\u2019t treat each other like strangers there. Part of the whole training process involves comrade and community. \n\nYou say hello. You are polite. You say goodbye and great job out there. What I\u2019m saying I\u2019d be polite and supportive but also don\u2019t act like a parent. \n\nAll kinds of step parents take a step back when both bio parents are there. It\u2019s not asking too much. It\u2019s part of the role.", "My thoughts exactly! I was so confused why that posts was getting praise! How about OP grow up and be grateful that his ex\u2019s bf has a loving relationship with his son. He himself can also join the class if he\u2019s so bothered by it.\nHe voiced his concern that he doesn\u2019t want the bf to drive him in his days and his ex gf was fine with it. So that issue seems settled. But who does he think he is to tell another adult that they aren\u2019t allowed to do their promotion on the same day as his son. \nOP is def jealous. He can sign up for a diff activity to do with his son if he wants to bond with him solely.", "He just wants some one on one with his son\ud83d\ude2d like yeah this new bf is in his sons life  and all but he\u2019s been there since the beginning and splitting time with your kid can be hard. I feel like not being able to see my kid everyday would take its toll and if one of my designated days gets taken away it\u2019s like wtf lol\nTotally get where this guy is coming from", "That's what I'm thinking. They're slowly encroaching on OPs personal time with his son and then gaslighting him into thinking he's out of line. If the situation was reversed, I don't think they'd like OP hanging around in their space.", "NTA for the reasons above", "The thing is they never went to court it was verbal agreement. If he really want to be possessive of his time with his son then he has to go the legal route.\nAnd there is if he\u2019s TAH for not wanting his ex bf to go to his son promotion. Yes it is because the bf is also getting the promotion same day so he\u2019ll have to be there anyways.", "Many places do. Many also offer an all ages class, and it's very common for kids to take the class with their parents. I plan to get back into it when I have kids and will look for an all ages class.", "Its pretty normal not to do that. My brither, my dad, and I were all in the same TKD class when I was a child. There were adults and kids.", "My TKD growing up had like kids classes and then \"adult/family\" classes where the only kids (or kids under like 13) attending would be the kids whose parents also do TKD in that class, which sort of makes sense just because it's logistically easier to have the same class as your kid at the same time, so maybe that's what's going on here? But other than that it does seem a bit wack, even if it's a small dojo you'd think they'd have like 1 or 2 mixed level adult classes a week instead of just mixing the old farts in with the kids", "Our tkd was kids then teens/ adults until black belt training and testing. From that point everyone was together.", "Otherwise you'd have Kramer kicking all those little kids asses.", "I would prefer that owen wilson be op and ben stiller is really good at tae kwon do", "Can we switch them out so op is Andrew tate and bf is Mike Tyson?", "I Am Cackling!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Comment stealing bot.\n\nReport > Spam > Harful Bots", "No, it isn't.   The BF probably just wanted to learn a new sport that he discovered .  He's supporting the child, probably practicing with him at home. And helped the kid move up a belt.   OP can learn, too.", "Feel better now?", "That's ridiculous. So now OP has to share HIS personal time with his exes boyfriend? That's complete horse shit. He's paying for the classes and taking his kid for those two to bond.\n\nThe boyfriend can bond on his time.", "That\u2019s sad dude. Poor step dad\u2019s trying his best and being a step parent is so hard. If anything, tell mom that those days should be considered her days and he should get an extra different day of the week with kiddo.", "For real!

I\u2019m sorry I call them \u201cthe little dance\u201d but I don\u2019t remember the actual name of the choreographed moves. Each belt has a different one so they will start with the group going to stripes or yellow or whatever and then the next group does theirs. It feels like a long day. And then the board breaking takes foooooorever and at that point I\u2019m just like please please please adults please break your boards on the first try so we can get out of here!!! \nBut yeah everyone is there, they are all standing there waiting for their turn and doing things together and separate from 4-78(the range in our specific school right now) \n\nI\u2019m sure different schools do it differently, but this is how it\u2019s done at the one my kid attends.", "The highest belt in the school is currently green, so I don\u2019t think they are throwing anyone around. The school has only been in my town for about 18 months and I live in a very small town.", "I have done TKD, and it depends on how big the club is. But, no a kid isn\u2019t throwing around or sparring adults, that\u2019s stupid. But, they will do drills and patterns (kata in karate, forgot the South Korean fern) together. It was when our club grew in size was when we had a little kid class and a big kid/ adult class.", "The club I grew up in had classes separated by age, but then they also offered a family class. This allowed family to do it as a group activity. Typically there were enough of us to pair us with similar aged folks. But we also often worked across ages as there is incredible learning that happens in intergenerational relationships. As a young girl, it was so powerful to see 40 year old women doing my sport along with me.\n\nIn my own experience kids stick with martial arts significantly longer when training with a parent. When I recieved my black belt at 13, all but one person in my class (of 9) trained with a parent or was the parent.\n\nI will also add that I found out many years later that my instructor was a pedophile and in many ways, I fit his target demographic. Except one thing. My dad trained with me. I suspect that alone may have been what protected me as I would have been a difficult target to groom."]}
