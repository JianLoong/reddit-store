If they do, then cut them out and don\u2019t look back.

NTA but you may need to tolerate your family until you get your ducks in order and find a new place.", "NTA. I hope this new arrangement works out but you sound very independent and resourceful so I feel pretty sure it will. I\u2019m sorry your water bottle was lost but in the end this might have been a good thing. Go well.", "NTA, there is no benefit to living with your parents so don't if you don't have to.", "NTA. You have to move out anyway. Water bottle does not matter. If all your post is true, they will not accept your position, so you might just tell you are grown up and need independent life.", "NTA: You are not acting up. You are standing up. Continue to be the resilient smart person you are. Build your own family of friends and family who see how wonderful you are.  \nI'm sorry your parents don't care and that your brother couldn't even be considerate enough to replace the water bottle he lost. You will be better off without them.", "NTA - my sister and father were the reason I moved out. The word \"family\" doesn't mean much to me, either. So, I totally get why you would leave. You had few belongings of your own and they weren't respected. Hopefully your situation works out, but I wouldn't ever go back if I were you. Your situation sounds very similar to what mine was, and I got as far away from them as I could.

You're 18 and already know and expect to pay rent. So I don't really see a point in going back to pay rent to them so they can ALLOW you to own 5 things.

You find your own family, your life starts now. Get your own bank account and fix all the papers that are needed.  You are on your journey to become your self.  Your parents will contact you when they  are out of money, ignore them.", "NTA, it's about the principle of it. Your cousin is wrong, ignore her. Your parents will reach out when they realise you moved out for good and can't get money from you anymore. If you have a bank account and they have access to it, change banks and open one in your name only. Hope you have all your documents in order so they can't hold them over your head to blackmail you into moving back in. Good luck", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Providing shelter is a parents job description. I cant believe your paying rent and your brother gets spending money!\n\nMoving out that young is tough but you can do it. Try to find as many supports as you can including friends, friends parents, a therapist or doctor, social worker, programs for young people.", "NTA\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.\n\nThey should apologize to *you*, but I wouldn't count on it. \n\nI'm sorry for what you've been going through.

It is absolutely wrong and unacceptable, and you deserved so much better from all of them. You deserved their love and support, and their treating you like their indentured servant because you\u2019re gay was (and is) straight-up evil, no matter what their religion. Your brother is 20, so at this point he is complicit in your family\u2019s mistreatment of you, while your parents\u2019 behavior is absolutely shocking.\n\nNTA, NTA, absolutely NTA. I\u2019m SO happy you\u2019re planning to move out. Perhaps take a beat and make an escape plan. Are there any groups in your area that support LGBTQ+ youth? They may have resources to help with a getting established in a new home, and it may help you plug into a support community of both peers who can relate to your struggles and adults who can provide mentoring, support, and\u2014eventually\u2014start to help you create a family of choice. You owe your family of origin nothing. Your cousin is wrong, ignore their advice. \n\nYou might update the post to clarify that your family isn\u2019t struggling financially, and that your being forced to turn over your paychecks is a punishment for your sexuality. You\u2019re 20yo brother receives a $2K/month allowance. Meanwhile, you\u2019ve had to work and pay rent since the age of 14, with your parents basically demanding your whole paycheck.\n\nI am so, so sorry to hear that your immediate and apparently even extended family (based on what you said was your cousin\u2019s terrible advice) have spent years systematically treating you like garbage. There\u2019s no way to come out of that without some scars, and I hope at some point you\u2019ll have access to therapy to help you recover from what surely has been a nightmare. For now, I am so happy for you that you are taking steps to take control of your future and get away from these assholes. I hope the rest of your life is full of love and support and beauty. You 100% deserve that. Please, move forward on a plan to get out. And take good care of yourself.", "Thank you so much. I needed someone to understand me.", "Basically my paycheck went to them and I worked for nothing. But if I stopped they would have kicked me out. I don't want anything to do with them at all.

It's worse to live on the street.", "So what I'm reading is: the younger sibling needs to work to pay rent.
