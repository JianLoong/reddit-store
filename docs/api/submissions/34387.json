Well it was a not so secret secret Santa, where we knew who each person got but it was so we would only buy one person gifts so no one would go ott. \n\nEDIT for info: the budget was $250 as in expectation was each person spend that amount. It wasn\u2019t a max $250 budget where you can spend within your means. Plus this person has a higher paying job than me and is better off financially as well and the whole friendship group agreed to this amount months before. I also saw gifts she gave to her own family when she posted on insta, all branded items.\n\nI spent the $250 and bought my secret Santa a dior silk scarf (DIOR OBLIQUE MITZAH SCARF to be precise) which I know she had been eyeing up for a while.\n\nI was excited to receive my gift since $250 is quite a lot so should be enough to get a good gift. Everyone else got some sort of branded item whether it be skincare, makeup, accessories etc. However when I opened my gift it was all handmade items.\n\nIt was two resin coasters(which weren\u2019t made very well I could see the bubbles), some bracelets made out of yarn (those friendship bracelets you have when you\u2019re younger- we\u2019re all in our 40s!!), a crocheted turtle and a painting she did(it\u2019s watercolour I think?). \n\nI jokingly asked her how this costs $250 and she dead seriously responded that the kits cost money and crocheted animals are sold for quite a lot of sites like etsy, and a bespoke commissioned painting is priceless??\n\nNow I understand that it\u2019s the thought that counts, and if she couldn\u2019t afford the $250 I would have understood. But it\u2019s not that she couldn\u2019t afford it, she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to \u2018try making them\u2019. It\u2019s like oh you didn\u2019t want this junk so gifted it to me?\n\nAITA for not appreciating these gifts? Apparently I\u2019ve really upset her by not being happy about what I received, but honestly if she had even added a $50 Starbucks card I would have been happier.\n\nEveryone else said I was over reacting and that it\u2019s a decent gift, but that\u2019s because they all got good branded items? I would happily trade my gifts for the dior scarf back, but obviously she said no\ud83d\ude44\n\nEDIT for info: no she\u2019s not a crafty person, she was just bored and watched too many crafty YouTube shorts/ instagram reels so was just passing the time by buying cheap kits off amazon\nAnd the painting she did was more like follow a YouTube tutorial and hope for the best - I also wont be hanging it anywhere in the house, she knows my daughter loves art and we have her pieces dotted around our house\n", "created_utc": 1704468157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z9cfq/aita_for_not_being_happy_to_receive_a_handmade/", "score": 494, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve made afghans that cost close to that much if you use really nice yarn.  These also take a really long time to make.  That would be a thoughtful gift that is handmade, even a sweater or something personal.  Handmade gifts are great, but there wasn\u2019t thought to your tastes put into these.", "NTA. For everyone screaming about how it's the thought that counts, there wasn't much thought put into the gift. For $250, OP received a gift that was essentially the giver's pet projects. Giver didn't even bother to find out if OP even liked crafts. Gifting 101. Where's the thought in that?", "NTA when the dollar amount is $250 you expect a nice gift because you presumably bought a nice gift. She could have gotten you a gift card and maybe one or two homemade things but not the whole gift. I understand people saying it\u2019s the thought that counts but when people make a dollar amount for the gift everyone should stick to it.", "NTA. Kits mean it wasn't done well. Kits are what you use when you're learning, I use them too. \n\nYou don't pay a craftsperson for the tools (kits) they own, you pay for their skill. Your friend is wanting you to buy them tools/supplies, for future use, as well as get a gift from the group. \n\nIt was pretty obvious what the expectations were with the $250 limit. Your friend was obviously trying to get something nice from participating, without having to spend.", "NTA\u2026I love making handmade items and I could see maybe one thing handmade, but all that?  Nope.  That person cheaped out.  For all those others saying you are overreacting, do they want to trade their gifts?  Hmmm\u2026what would they say when you \u201cre gift\u201d those same items?   \u201cOh, friend, you were right, I over reacted, but, alas, gift just wasn\u2019t my style.  Since you loved it so much, I decided to gift it to you!\u201d  Bet their tune changes.  You either participate if you can afford to do so, or you opt out.  Or you discuss lowering the cost.  A yarn friendship bracelet?   The only person I would appreciate that from is my grandchild.  Or my bestie.  But when everyone else got a name brand item and you did not?  And is she an artist?  What exactly is a bespoke commissioned painting?  Is her art priceless?", "NTA \n\nAnd this is why...\n\n>I would happily trade my gifts for the dior scarf back, but obviously she said no\ud83d\ude44\n\nIf she were actually hurt/expecting you to like the gifts, she wouldn't have hesitated to take her gift back and return yours.\n\nThe fact that she wants to hold on to your pricey gift, AND act outraged that you don't like the crap she made while she was bored, speaks volumes.\n\nShe knew EXACTLY what she was doing.\n\nEven IF the craft kits cost anywhere close to $250 (they did not) you're paying for the experience/hours of amusement, not the amateur product at the end.\n\nShe gave you a thoughtless/selfish gift. \n\nAnd you should re-gift her homemade crap to any of your friends who are currently siding with her.", "I\u2019ll probably be in the minority here, and am fully prepared to accept downvotes.\n\nNTA \n\nI know it\u2019s supposed to be the thought that counts, but it\u2019s a different story when a group commits to an exchange with a max of $250 (which is insane, but I digress). \n\nIf she were a skilled artist and she gifted you with a personalized or specialized piece, that would have been acceptable. \n\nBut she apparently gifted you tchotchkes she created from $10-$20 craft kits. Yes, she spent her money and her time, but it doesn\u2019t sound like this is in keeping with what your group does. \n\nIt\u2019s easy for your friends to say it\u2019s NBD because they got high dollar items. You received summer camp arts & crafts projects (outside of the painting, maybe). \n\n*With all that said, I would apologize to the person who gifted you.* NO, DON\u2019T APOLOGIZE. \n\nMoving forward, I think your group needs to sit back and reassess your annual gathering and gift exchange. Maybe keep it simple, like getting together for a nice dinner and splitting the bill.", "NTA; not because of the handmade, but because the gift wasn't personal. I assume if she'd crocheted you a scarf or made you a dress in colors/styles you like, you would have appreciated that as unique and taking into account your taste. This seems more like she just didn't think about what you like", "NTA. She wanted to try those kits for her own benefit, not for yours. Unless you're a kid, you don't give a handmade gift unless it's as high a quality as what someone would spend good money on. You were expecting a quality gift that you could enjoy, instead you got the outcome of her experiments.", "NTA. While I think it's tactless to ask for the gifts to be traded back, the fact that she didn't say yes is weird. If I so \"sentimentally\" gifted someone handmade products and they asked for their gift back, I'd be so so shocked and hurt I'd say yes in an instant. The fact that she said no... Almost makes me think she did this just to save money?", "NTA. Handmade gifts are not appropriate for a Secret Santa with a $250 budget. Period.", "1. The craft kits aren\u2019t age-appropriate gifts. It sounds like they were intended for tweens/teens, not adults. \n\n2. The condition of the gifts given was so poor, they wouldn\u2019t be put on the shelves at GoodWill. If your friend justified the gifts based on the cost of the kits, she should have given you the unopened kits. Instead, she gave you craft kits in severely used condition, with significant pieces of the kits missing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I love making homemade gifts for people. People I\u2019m close to. People I know will appreciate them. I\u2019d never dare to be part of a gift exchange with such a high dollar amount and think anyone would be happy with something I made unless they specifically asked for it.", "NTA- the limit pertains to the price of the gift. Not the cost of labour and supplies\u2026. If it was too extravagant for your friend she should have spoken up.   \ndid she keep the resin molds, knitting needles, water colour paints, or were they included?   \nIf not, you were definitely short changed.", "NTA. In my group of friends we are no where near a $250 budget and handmade gifts are accepted and welcomed, but if I were also in a group with a high budget where no one has once gifted some handmade items then I\u2019d be smart enough to know it\u2019s not the vibe for them. \n\nI have a friend who is an amazing painter, her gifts are lovely and are always geared towards your interests, I hang them with love in my house. I have a friend who has been doing cross stitch for years and she cross stitched me my favourite quotation from my favourite book. I crocheted a big pumpkin for my friend since I know she loves autumnal decor. \n\nAll this to say, if you\u2019re going handmade, it needs to fit the vibe of the other gifts (and if $250 is too much that year explain it to others so the budget for everyone can go down), and/or be good, and/or already be something the person might want (the and/or is important, if you\u2019re grandma would love that terrible knit scarf you made them gift it!). Besides resin coasters, which are useful, the rest is just random stuff she made which has no relation to your life (unless you secretly love turtles).", "NTA. I\u2019m a craftsperson. I appreciate time and effort. However, first attempts at a craft are not appropriate gifts in this context. There might be people who can do these things and charge that much, but she is not one of them. I wouldn\u2019t give a handmade gift in this context unless it fit the budget and I knew the recipient would actually want it.", "NTA\n\nBut you know there are ways to do secret Santa without knowing who your secret Santa is right? You can put all the names in a hat and all pull one out of you can use a website. I recommend a website, because those eliminate the risk of geschikt your own name.\n\n I think your friend does not understand the difference between crappy crafts made by your child and crappy crafts made by an adult.", "NTA. \n\nIt's the thought that counts, yeah. But she had the wrong thoughts here. Her thoughts were very clearly 'I'mma save that money and make gifts instead!\". That's AH behaviour, for sure.\n\nI'm all for handmade gifts in the right circumstances. I've both given and received them many times. But this was very clearly an expensive gift exchange. You were all meant to spend a large amount of money and get something bought and nice for each other. I'd be pissed too, OP.", "This must be my poorness speaking but $250 for a friend's gift exchange? Good grief, that's a lot.\n\nI don't think you're the AH necessarily but I just...geez. I would be unhappy for sure.", "NTA. If she was actually good at it sure. But sounds like she cheaped out. Like my office group would have $250 worth of my crafts, but they actually know I\u2019m good at my craft. I make homemade candy, cakes and blankets and even lace shawls. I\u2019ve shown them my work and each person who is gifted my items is beyond happy. Why because unlike this lady, I excel at my craft to where they would actually pay for my work.", "NTA. Ask your friends if they want to trade. When you agree to a secret Santa exchange with a $250 budget, and you can\u2019t afford it, you\u2019re immediately an asshole.", "NTA this was in no way a thoughtful gift. Those kits are intended to gift or use for yourself, not to play with and then give away whatever you tried to make. This lady sounds a little mentally immature", "Info, as you mentioned she said kits, were these items themed to things you like? Were they colors you like, are you a turtle collector, was the painting something you would display?", "NTA. I guarantee if you did the same thing next year to any of the friends they suddenly wouldn't think the gifts were so 'decent'. \n\n...I wouldn't participate at all next time though.", "Bespoke commissioned painting \ud83d\ude05 Who commissioned it exactly? NTA.", "NTA. The gifts she gave were inappropriate to the occasion. There is nothing wrong with handmade gifts but, with a budget that high, it was obvious that those gift were not right.", "I am a skilled artist. I went to art school and my work has been displayed in galleries. This year at work we did secret Santa and our limit was $35. I had already bought all my gifts and even though it was $35 I could not afford to spend anymore money on other people. I decided to paint my coworker a painting of her cats. \n\nBut even as someone who\u2019s artwork has been displayed and purchased by strangers for actual real life money, I still got my coworker other things. I saw a mug I knew she would love and a tea towel that matched and gave those items and the painting to her for secret Santa. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s gifter has a lot of artistic background, considering that they were using artist kits from Amazon and anyone who makes art knows how poor quality the materials in those kits are. It\u2019s some mental gymnastics for sure but it sounds like they used that white elephant budget to justify purchasing materials to dip their feet into different artistic media and pawned the results off to OP. \n\nNTA. Even as an actual, has been paid for my art artist, I still added a couple of store bought items to my white elephant gift this year, and once again, our price point was $35, nowhere close to $250. I think you have every right to be upset about this.", "NTA. \nAs a crafty person, the title on its own had me going \u2018slow your roll, Michael Scott\u2019. But then I actually read the post. \n\n$250 gift limit. If the limit was <$100 you would be TA, but as a group you all chose a very high limit, so of course the expectation is to get an expensive gift. I\u2019m guessing all the other gifts were hovering above $150, but a cursory google search shows that your friend probably only spent about $80 on craft kits. \n\nThe hyping of how much she spent. Crochet animals sell for a lot on Etsy? Yeah, ones that are made by people who have honed the craft, usually with more complex patterns, not something you can get from a $20 craft kit. Craft kits don\u2019t cost much at all, considering the gift limit. \u2018Bespoke commissioned painting\u2019? Okay, look, your first ever attempt at a watercolor painting is not going to be \u2018bespoke\u2019 anything, and also it was NOT a commission. Spending $80 to commission a painting from an online artist would have been more meaningful than what she did.", "$250 gift limit? Yikes!\n\nHang on to those handmade gifts and regift them in next year's Secret Santa.", "NTA. I was a craftsy person, but the things you received were kitschy, random objects that were clearly not made with you in mind. I would be annoyed too. My family has stopped mass gifting at Christmas and we do a draw instead with quite a low budget. My secret Santa made significant effort and it meant a lot to me as it was the only gift I got this Christmas!", "That\u2019s a piss off. NTA. \n\nWould have made sense if it was handmade things you need/like but it seems like she made them in her free time and didn\u2019t know what else to do with them.", "Yeah, I was looking at those resin kits online for my sons birthday, and you can get them for $ 30/40 and make Iike a dozen coasters with all the supplies it came with. So maybe they received $6 worth of coasters. I'd be pissed too. Even if this person gifted them all of the supplies used, it wouldn't come near $250. \n\nAnd yes, the cost does matter when doing a gift exchange with a value like that. You are expecting an equivalent gift. It's unfair and I guarantee all the friends would feel the same if they got these crap gifts.", "She bought herself craft supplies, used them, and then gave you the results. Gifts are for the person receiving the gift, not for the giver to receive compliments on their crafts. Handmade items that have been asked for or that the receiver has shown (genuine, repeated) interst in are ok. The results of craft day isn't a gift. Especially at that price limit.\n\nUnrelated to the crafting element, imo, price limits like this are kinda indicating the price of ONE item (or maybe a couple of nice items). Getting 250 dollar store items, or 10 things thay cost $25 would also be shitty to do, and she kinda did that by dividing it all up.\n\nAs a crafter and someone who likes making gifts (when asked for, or when gifts were a bonus and not expected anyway), you are NTA. If you gift you handmade items and the receiver doesn't like them, take note and I'm the future do not spend you time and energy making something which is basically for yourself.\n\nEdit: misunderstood nah/nta", "NTA even if she bought the most expensive yarn, acrylic liquids etc it does not add up to 250 AND i\u2019m sure she had a lot left over for her personal use. I think she just bought things she wanted, threw together some stuff for you and is happy creating whatever SHE wants with the rest of the money and supplies. You don\u2019t buy 1 piece of paper or a foot of string, she has all the rest of the supplies, molds, needles, lights etc for her own selfish uses. She bought that with herself in mind and honestly she just gave you her first attempts. I would discuss leaving her out the next time bc that was incredibly ridiculous of her.", "NTA and hopefully after this you keep a distance from this cheap friend (avoid going to lunches/dinners with her) and your group decides this expensive not so secret Santa is a bad idea after all.", "NTA\n\nA handmade blanket or a sweater or a nice hat and scarf would be better than little kits, if she were skilled, and if she used high quality materials. Or if she was an artist herself and she did a nice piece just for you that was of something you value, that'd be nice. \n\nShe took a low cost, low effort approach and next to all the other gifts exchanged is not of equal value. You're right to be upset or offended over it and you should ask anyone in the group who thinks otherwise if they'd be willing to trade ot share gifts since they think so well of them. If they aren't willing, then they should recognize that they are wrong.", "NTA - there's a value assigned for a reason.  I haven't participated in a Secret Santa since the year some guy at my office gifted me 2 balls of mismatched acrylic yarn.  Our price point was $25.  These people should not participate if they aren't willing to spend the set amount.  If she wanted to gift you her craft experiments AS WELL as something valued around the agreed upon $250, that would be different.", "NTA - this gift was for her, not you", "$250?!?! I spent less than that in total on all the presents I bought. I'm clearly in the wrong job \ud83e\udd23", "NTA - There was a clear theme here, and it was \"spend $250.00 on the other person\". While I think you're privileged as all hell to even be able to do this weird high limit game of Secret Santa, which is wholly inappropriate for the life I live, you do you... and there were clearly set expectations that she didn't follow. If she's rich like you, then yeah she should've dropped the scratch. But if she's from a different socio-economic strata than you, this entire concept would make you TA instead of her.", "NTA I dont do this kind of thing cuz everytime I get the cheap person who can\u00b4t follow simple instructions.", "NTA\n\nI made my MIL a beautiful cable knit scarf that took me months to finish. I fully understand the time it takes to make something for someone.\n\nIt sounds like the bought herself maybe $100 worth of startup crafting supplies, and gave you the stuff that came out of it.\n\nThat\u2019s not a gift.", "NTA. nobody wants unskilled and sloppy \u201chandmade\u201d gifts from a 40 year old\u2026 if she couldn\u2019t have afforded $250, she shouldn\u2019t have even participated in this secret santa event", "Being gifted handmade items from someone who does it *well*, as a passion/side-job/profession? Absolutely amazing gifts. The best ones, frankly.\n\nGetting the junky discards from someone who's messing around with some craft kits they bought?

I gift expensive makeup from Sephora and cosmetics stuff. When I got a bag of candy that I didn\u2019t even like with a two coffee drinks. I spent 100$ at least and what I receive was less than. Not an equal trade at all. But also been on the end of things where I didn\u2019t have the money to join in on gifts.  NTA but I feel like if there is a max there should be a min amount to cover.", "NTA why did she commit to this if she couldn\u2019t afford it? I understand it may have been uncomfortable but she could have said it\u2019s out of her budget", "NTA. I would post the stuff she made to an auction site and see how much they sell for. Then send her the result just so she knows what it\u2019s actually worth. But I am still salty I got a used tie 10 years ago from my very wealthy boss.", "NTA i would have snatched that scarf back asap", "NTA- not only was she cheap she basically used your presents and gave you the leftovers. Even if you count the value of the kits (which I doubt add up to $250) the whole point of those kind of kits is letting interested people try the craft. Unless she is a master crafter or artist that can elevate the materials (and the receiver wanted a handmade present) she basically took the potential fun and enjoyment from the supplies. Imagine giving someone a completed Lego kit.", "As someone with a small business of handmade stuff, I was prepared to be mad, but NTA\n\nSome people are saying you shouldn't give handmade stuff as a gift at all when it's that price, which I disagree, as skilled handmade stuff exists and has its value.\n\nI think the issue here is: they gifted, on a very high budget Secret Santa, stuff they most likely just did on a whim. It's not even about the thoughts or stuff.", "I think we need to see these items..\n\nNext year make sure your her secret santa and make her some nice home made items to return the generosity.", "When it comes to gift exchanges with monetary value expected doing handmade things only really works in 2 situations, someone is really freaking good at what they do and it\u2019s a high quality gift (for example at this price point I would expect a full homemade quilt) or it\u2019s a 10$ gift exchange and they spent 10$ on yarn and made a hat out of it so they could give a nicer gift while still within the limits. NTA for not appreciating what sounds like 20-30$ of crafting material turned into bad crafts.", "NTA\n\n\u201cits the thought that counts!\u201d assumes thought was involved. which it clearly was not, or the handmade items would have been more personal to you, something you like and could use, something THOUGHTFUL", "Maybe not yta but my new rating of yambd (you all made bad decisions) to participate in a secret Santa with a budget of $250. That's crazy. Set it at 20 and call it a day. You guys primed yourselves for exactly this situation.", "NTA those gifts would only acceptable with an under $50 limit. Your friend really sucks and should not be invited to this high end secret Santa anymore.", "NTA although she made the gift, it seems rather rude and thoughtless to consider the price of her kits (where she only made you ONE \u201cfabulous\u201d yarn sea creature when she probably has enough product and instructions to make at least 4 different sea creatures. Same for the friendship bracelet kit.) into your gift. She should have just given you the entire unused, brand new kit instead with this thought process. I\u2019m sorry you went out of your way for someone else when the person you got clearly doesn\u2019t give an F about your feelings and your time.", "NTA.\n\nYour secret santa actually gave more of a gift to herself than to you. \n\nBut what I see is more of a psychological problem than one of manners. Our brains enjoy learning new things and will produce dopamine when we do. Or brains enjoy working with our hands and will produce dopamine when we do. Our brains enjoy repetitve tasks for their meditative nature and will produce dopamine when we get into a flow state. Dopamine feels good and it is addictive.\n\nOnce you add all of those things up, it sounds to me as if your friend is suffering from mental health issues, is likely prone to addiction, and was using these activities to self medicate. The fact that winter depression caused by low light coincides with the pre-holiday prep and the timing would also make sense. I obviously don't know her so I can't say that is the case, but perhaps looking at it from this point of view can help you forgive her massive social faux pas. \n\nBut I like giving people the benefit of the doubt because the idea of someone being that stupid or selfish for no reason is horrifying, so that could just be me.\n\nSorry you got the wrong person as your secret santa!", "NTA \n\nI paint, large intricate pet portraits. People pay good money for them, but you know what I would have done?  ASKED. Are you interested in handmade item? I drew your name, if so tell me what you want. If not I go from there. ART is VERY subjective to the person enjoying the art. She put ZERO THOUGHT into what she was giving you. She just expected you to be quiet because it\u2019s handmade so of course it\u2019s personal! But it was in fact not personal.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m an artist. I make handmade plush, jewelry, stationery, etc. Some I sell in retail stores.\n\nI would *never* give them in Secret Santa\u2019s. It\u2019s tacky as hell in my opinion. When you\u2019re given a *budget* to spend in a SS, it\u2019s just too difficult to judge handmade goods under the same threshold, no matter how good/beautiful/unique they are. Go to the store like everyone else, it\u2019s just proper, polite, and fair.", "This is always the problem with Secret Santa and why I won\u2019t participate anymore. In every group there is always someone who clearly doesn\u2019t put in the same budget/effort or just drops the ball altogether and \u201cforgets\u201d. Someone is always disappointed. I am sure some people will say there are exceptions, but I just won\u2019t do it anymore. I simply gift with whatever budget I want to whoever I want without expecting anything back. \n\nNTA. I love handmade items, but first try\u2019s and random kits are not appropriate gifts. Build up the skill and make something with the person\u2019s personal preferences and interests in mind.", "NTA.  If the budget was $250, I have to think the expectation is that there would be a minimum $200 spent here.  My wife was super stressed because our grade school child's friend group picked $35 as a budget, and a LOT of kids things end up being $25, so finding the additional $10 (but not go over) actually caused some stress so that we didn't look like cheapskates.  So we bought a $25 thing and a few $3 things to make it $34.  Apparently a few others in the group had the same issue, because almost everyone had the same sort of present set, which was a $20-25 thing, and a few small things to make up the difference to at least get over $30.  The larger learning was don't let a bunch of grade school kids pick their budget.  We will set the budget for them at $30 next year, and this way a $25 gift won't look like its $10 off.  So yes your friend underperformed here.", "Wait you got HER the scarf? It\u2019s the same person??? Bruh she took you for a RIDE", "NTA\n\nFriendship bracelets? Like you\u2019re 12? This woman is delusional. And you\u2019re right that people are only saying you\u2019re overreacting because they all got nice gifts. \n\nAlso $250 is insane for a friend group.

Well it was a not so secret secret Santa, where we knew who each person got but it was so we would only buy one person gifts so no one would go ott. \n\nI spent the $250 and bought my secret Santa a dior silk scarf (DIOR OBLIQUE MITZAH SCARF to be precise) which I know she had been eyeing up for a while.\n\nI was excited to receive my gift since $250 is quite a lot so should be enough to get a good gift. Everyone else got some sort of branded item whether it be skincare, makeup, accessories etc. However when I opened my gift it was all handmade items.\n\nIt was two resin coasters(which weren\u2019t made very well I could see the bubbles), some bracelets made out of yarn (those friendship bracelets you have when you\u2019re younger- we\u2019re all in our 40s!!), a crocheted turtle and a painting she did(it\u2019s watercolour I think?). \n\nI jokingly asked her how this costs $250 and she dead seriously responded that the kits cost money and crocheted animals are sold for quite a lot of sites like etsy, and a bespoke commissioned painting is priceless??\n\nNow I understand that it\u2019s the thought that counts, and if she couldn\u2019t afford the $250 I would have understood. But it\u2019s not that she couldn\u2019t afford it, she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to \u2018try making them\u2019. It\u2019s like oh you didn\u2019t want this junk so gifted it to me?\n\nAITA for not appreciating these gifts? Apparently I\u2019ve really upset her by not being happy about what I received, but honestly if she had even added a $50 Starbucks card I would have been happier.\n\nEveryone else said I was over reacting and that it\u2019s a decent gift, but that\u2019s because they all got good branded items? I would happily trade my gifts for the dior scarf back, but obviously she said no\ud83d\ude44\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Part of the experience of buying those kits is doing it yourself. She pretty much used up the fun of the kit and gave you the low quality output.", "NTA. That sounds like a lot of money to me, but if y'all agreed on it, I imagine it's because it's affordable. \n\nThe most important thing is that, we crafters, know who to gift to and who not to gift to.

She probably spent all that money on kits for her, didn't like the results, and decided to gift them to you. \n\nI do a lot of crochet, and sell blankets upwards of 300 $.

IMHO a Secret Santa arrangement just has a different set of expectations and a hand made gift doesn't qualify generally.\n\n$250 is a LOT of money on crafts unless your buying Awagami paper and Michael Harding oil paints, haha. I agree that if she had made some crafty gifts and also included a gift card of two it would have been a much more acceptable gift.\n\nThe only thing to consider is this: are you giving a gift to get something equivalent in return or are you giving a gift because you care about the person?

It would be one thing if this was a queen-size crochet blanket or a knitted wool sweater from someone with some experience and skill. Those would 100% be worth $250 if not more because of the years spent mastering a skill and the time put in to make something custom and special. \n\nThis sounds more like someone who couldn't decide what to do one weekend and bought some craft kits to entertain herself. These gifts had absolutely no thought put in for the recipient. \n\nI don't think it had to be something designer. It just had to be tailored to you. She knew who she was gifting to.", "NTA, regift them next year to whoever you pull for secret santa lol.", "I was fully against you till you mentioned that this isn't her profession, and she just wanted to try the things she gave you.

There's a budget that everyone agreed to so there's an expectation. This gift was not on par with that expectation, and she knew it.

I'm very crafty and love to DIY gifts, but resin coasters and friendship bracelets are for gifts with no financial expectation, not a situation where you know how much the other person is spending on you. With her interest in crafting and her knowledge about the exchange, she could have done SO many things. Buy a designer leather wristlet and craft a keychain. Buy some nice beauty products and DIY a resin tray to display them in. Hell, buy literally any $250 gift and then DIY the card/wrapping. But don't be cheap! You give crafters a bad name!", "NTA - I am a crafty person. Sometimes when I do secret Santa I toss in a handmade item on top of the other stuff.

I'd be shocked if they totaled $100 in funds spent on the kits.  Knowing the budget and being familiar with your friend group, she could have easily gotten you a thoughtful, worthwhile, on budget item. Instead she made you take out her trash.\n\nI'd reconsider any future gift exchanges that you participate in. Can you ask for the scarf back?", "When I was in year 4, we did a secret santa for our class, $25 limit. You were meant to gift it anonymously into a pile with only a to:___ line and no from:___ line. A lot of people got really nice stuff. The girl who gave me my present (a really nice girl, I think she just misunderstood the assignment) gave me one of her old teddies, and wrote her name on the tag, so I didn't even get to guess who it was from. I got really upset, left the class, threw it out, cried and went home. That memory is still seared into my mind years later and this reminded me of that.", "NTA.\n\nThose would have been nice add-ons in addition to a larger gift. There's a time and a place for handmade items, but if there's a precedent for designer/brand/store-bought items for this gift exchange, that's not it. \n\nDo the coasters match any of your decor? Do you like turtles? It really sounds like she threw her impulse TikTok crafts into a box rather than in the trash.", "NTA - I would be pissed if that happened to me. Is this the person that received the expensive scarf? \n\nSomething similar happened to me but I ended the friendship because of it. My friend insisted on exchanging gifts for our birthday she talked about gifting me for many months so I spent a chunk of time and money getting her an expensive Jewllery. She got me makeup that is not suitable for my skin from Poundland ( Mike you at the time she was making a lot more money than me) \nI completely ended the friendship. I would have been perfectly fine if she got me nothing but a card but she went out of her way to get me make up from Poundland while trying to get me to spend more on her gift.", "NTA. Actually, if a trash bag was passed around to pick up wrapping paper I\u2019d have dumped the whole lot into it.", "Going NTA, but i have to editorialize here: Maybe I\u2019m old and out of touch, but a secret Santa limit of $250 sounds totally unhinged to me. \n\nMoreover, anyone participating at that buy-in is going to be pissed if they spend the limit and receive anything of lesser value. Hell, we did a $25-limit white elephant gift exchange with my wife\u2019s family, and we brought some funny gifts that were well under $25 (because that\u2019s the POINT) and my SIL made a jokey comment about how there was no way it cost $25. Materialism is really out of hand.\n\nThat said though, If the friend wasn\u2019t going to invest the money, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to participate. And as a friend of a couple highly-skilled knitters, it\u2019s understood you practice and GET BETTER at crafting before you start giving major handmade gifts. I really wanted to drop an E S H, but if she agreed to $250, your friend is TA.\n\nIdea for next year: agree to all give each other handmade gifts. Do a \u201ccost of materials\u201d limit, each of you pick a craft to learn about that looks interesting or fun, and make something that will at worst be a conversation piece and at best be a cherished memory for years.", "NTA because of this\n\n>weren\u2019t made very well\n\n>she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to \u2018try making them\u2019.\n\n>no she\u2019s not a crafty person, she was just bored and watched too many crafty YouTube shorts/ instagram reels so was just passing the time by buying cheap kits off amazon And the painting she did was more like follow a YouTube tutorial and hope for the best\n\nIf she had an actual skill/craft and had gifted you something well made this would be an entirely different issue. If that were the case, she would have understood how to give you a handmade gift that you would love, made with high end materials, going with your personal style, etc. These things are not really possible using pre made kits. \n\nAlso, it sounds like brand names and brand logos and all that is important to you, which I'm guessing your friend is aware of. So she should have known that you would appreciate something branded. It's good gift giving etiquette to go with what the recipient would like, not what you want to try out/give away. It's just clear that all around she did not think of YOU when giving this gift.", "NTA!

If it was a money issue or she was actually good at the crafts I might say different. I crochet and made a hello kitty cardigan for someone. It was 20 hours work and with the cost of the yarn well worth at least \u00a3100, maybe more if I went on a hourly wage. But I crochet for pleasure, it's not my job. Something like a secret Santa where you've agreed on a set budget, no. She was being cheap. I'd be disappointed too.", "NTA\n\nIf it was well hand made gifts that you could actually use or meant something then it would be a different story. poorly made, first time craft junk is disrespectful. I'm sorry but your friend probably does not like you and your other friends pretending that they'd be happy with those kinds of gifts suck.", "NTA - and her gifts to you didn\u2019t cost anywhere near the $250 agreed upon. She went cheap, she got an amazing gift from you, but didn\u2019t care or bother to do the same for you. A lot of handmade gifts are amazing and really well made, but in this case they weren\u2019t.

I also know that she prefers a more modern style quilt, so I found a pattern that matches her aesthetic. As a result they use the quilt constantly and love it.\n\nHad I not consulted with her I would have made something in the right ballpark, but not quite what she was looking for.

I've done a couple of those paint and sip things, the end product isn't priceless because it's good art, it's valuable to me because it's a fun memory of getting together with my friends and in 2 of the cases was a custom pet portrait of our pets. Those have no value to anybody else.", "My thought too. That's almost twice as much as what I spent on my husband's gift last time. I think OP can chalk this up to a learning experience: unless you are an heiress, Secret Santa budget should never go above a 2-digit number.

So everyone gets included  \n2)  The friend should understand when the limit is $250, you're going to look real cheap by giving gifts like this.  \n3)  OP is included here due to the fact that whether the gifts were cheap or not, OP's friend still spent the time to make this stuff.

Now it's done intentionally as part of a design. \n\nIf I was gifted a coaster set like my first few accident ones, I'd be annoyed. It's so easy to just mix some resin and drop it in a mold.
